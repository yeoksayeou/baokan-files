Luoyang: Chinese troops in the areas south of Shanxi and north of Henan, with a far-reaching large encirclement, are pressing the stubbornly resisting Japanese troops in the area between Bo'ai and Jincheng, tightening their lines and attacking on all sides. The Japanese troops, in extreme panic, are staging breakouts. On the morning of the 27th, one group fled north but was intercepted by the Chinese forces at Jianxidayang Village, north of Jincheng. They were met with a head-on attack and threw away their weapons, fleeing into the mountains in disarray.

### The Chinese Army's Spring Offensive – A Quick Victory

With the warming climate, the Sino-Japanese war, which had been in a stalemate, is gradually showing signs of activity. The continuous stream of victories from the northern and southern battlefields not only directly strikes at the clumsy and inadequate political offensive of the Japanese side but also provides unparalleled comfort to the struggling and determined people. The ever-increasing confidence in becoming stronger through fighting and the belief that the war of resistance will surely be won are all further realized in this full-scale offensive by the Chinese army.

If military developments can be divided into smaller segments, then this full-scale offensive by the Chinese army should be considered to have begun with the Suiyuan-Western campaign in late March. At that time, it was the eve of the Nanjing farce, and people may not have paid due attention to the recovery of the two strongholds of Wuyuan and Linhe in the barren Gobi Desert. However, that was precisely the most important scene of the war since the beginning of 1940. It demonstrated the extent of the Japanese army's declining strength, which was unable to secure even strongholds of great strategic value. Moreover, after the Japanese army's initial defeat, their repeated reinforcements and counter-offensives only served to expose their exhausted state, and they finally abandoned their attempt to make a comeback. At the same time, the Chinese army on the Guangxi-Guangdong border repelled the Japanese army's invasion near Lingshan, completing the second annihilation campaign in southern Guangxi. The Japanese army was also unable to launch a strategic offensive, and its greatest tactic was merely jump-style harassment operations to protect its rear strongholds connected to the sea. On the northern Jiangxi front, the counter-offensive was launched around Nanchang on the 4th of this month, and important strongholds such as Fengxin, Jing'an, Anyi, Xiangtang, Xishan, and Wanshou Palace were recovered one after another, directly threatening the suburbs of Nanchang. From the 15th, a heroic and fierce battle unfolded again between the Zhongtiao and Taihang Mountains in southern Shanxi. The Japanese forces, with a strength of 100,000, advanced along nine routes, attacking south from Yuncheng, Anyi, Xiaxian, Yicheng, Changzi, Changzhi, Huguan, and other places. The battle stretched across a 4-500 *li* area from Maojin in the west to Lingchuan in the east. The Japanese side's intention was clearly to revive its unfulfilled wish to cleanse the mountainous areas south of Shanxi, but its strategic deployment and troop mobilization were not necessarily stronger than in previous attempts. After two weeks of fighting, the Japanese army, suffering heavy casualties, was trapped in encirclement and annihilation. In addition to the recovery of Maojin Ferry, Lingchuan, Yangcheng, and Gaoping, the Chinese army's counter-sweeping operations clearly had full confidence. What was particularly encouraging was that the Chinese army suddenly attacked Kaifeng on the 23rd, engaging in street fighting for a day and still fiercely fighting in the suburbs. Among the above-mentioned battles, the Suiyuan-Western and Guangxi-Southern campaigns repelled the Japanese army's advance, the Jiangxi-Northern and Henan-Eastern campaigns counter-attacked the Japanese side's strongholds, and the Shanxi-Southern campaign was a contest between sweeping and counter-sweeping. All these battles, although different in strategic nature, all achieved significant results. From another perspective, that is, whether the Japanese side is attacking, defending, or carrying out rear "sweeping" operations, it has been consistently defeated. This is an important test and also implies the final outcome of the Sino-Japanese war.

Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has blindly followed Germany in military matters, striving to emulate Germany in both soldier training and strategic application. However, the results have not only failed to resemble the German army but have even been vastly different. For example, the blitzkrieg tactics used by Germany against Poland, Denmark, and Norway, although difficult to escape moral condemnation, must be acknowledged for their high degree of achievement in military terms. This Nazi product is by no means something that the Japanese army's troop quality and military equipment can learn. The followers of Itagaki fantasize day and night about performing an eastern Tannenberg miracle, but they do not realize that in the several concrete and subtle Tannenberg battles in southern Shandong and northern Hubei, it was not the Chinese army that was encircled and annihilated, but the Japanese army itself. This experience of failing to imitate a tiger should be a profound lesson for the Japanese plutocrats. Looking back on the course of the Sino-Japanese war over the past three years, initially, the Japanese army's strategy and tactics were successful, but only its fundamental political strategy failed, such as in the fierce battles of North China and Shanghai. Then, it was able to maintain some success tactically but failed strategically, such as in the Shanxi-Western, Hunan-Northern, and Guangdong-Northern campaigns last year and this spring. However, in recent battles, it has been defeated in every battle, with no strategic or tactical success whatsoever. Its military application has run counter to its desire to conquer China. However, this has not prompted the Japanese plutocrats to repent but has instead turned to the delusion of using politics to alleviate the military's distress. In fact, that political offensive still relies on military strength for support. However, the dilapidated Japanese army is not able to save the Japanese plutocrats any face, fight a few victories to embellish the situation, but instead welcomes the arriving Abe "special envoy" with successive defeats, just as the Japanese army in northern Hunan welcomed Nishio and Itagaki with a disastrous defeat last autumn. Of course, the current Chinese army is only launching a full-scale offensive and has not yet reached the time for a general counter-offensive. The Japanese army may still have other new tricks waiting to be used. However, all the possible strategies of the Japanese plutocrats have been tried and ultimately failed, with only their adventure in southern Guangxi being the only exception during the second phase of the war of resistance, but it also cannot save the Japanese army's overall decline in any way. The Chinese army's current offensive is already difficult for the Japanese side to resist, so the future is predictable—naturally, the Chinese side should also strive to eliminate the drawbacks of arrogance or underestimation of the enemy due to victory—even if the favorable conditions of China in political, economic, and diplomatic aspects are all put aside, looking at it solely from a military point of view, the future can also be optimistic. This is not wishful thinking, but a conclusion written in blood and flesh by Chinese heroes in the northern and southern battlefields.

### National Government Consolidates Economic Defense Line

Chongqing: According to today's political news, the National Government has decided to establish an organization in Chongqing similar to the blockade departments and economic warfare departments of Britain and France in order to intensify the blockade of Japanese goods and consolidate its economic defense line. This new organization will be jointly managed by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Military Law Department of the Military Affairs Commission. This organization may be named the Economic Blockade Commission. The government's intensified blockade is due to the discovery that Japanese goods of considerable value are still being smuggled into Free China. Even with numerous tax collection agencies in Suiyuan and Guangxi, they have not been able to stop the smuggling. These goods are transported by rail, road, waterway, and other routes. According to official estimates, the total value of Japanese goods smuggled into Free China is 100 million yuan annually. These Japanese goods are adorned with Chinese trademarks and labeled with the words "Made in China" to deceive Chinese customs officials. The smuggled Japanese goods are mainly textiles, cosmetics, matches, pencils, and cigarettes. Officials also stated that with the establishment of this new organization, the tax collection agencies in various regions will all be under its jurisdiction. As it is also under the jurisdiction of the Military Law Department, smugglers will be subject to military trials and severely punished. (United Press dispatch of the 28th)

### The US Neutrality Act Does Not Need to Be Amended Before the Election; Britain and France Have Sufficient Financial Resources to Purchase Various War Supplies from the United States Within Two Years

Washington: Observers in political circles here have recently stated that the current Neutrality Act is unlikely to be amended during the current session of Congress. It is generally expected that discussions will be postponed until the end of this year's election when Congress reconvenes in January of next year. Regarding this matter, Democratic Senator Adams recently advocated that the provisions in the Neutrality Act prohibiting the granting of loans to belligerent countries should be amended as soon as possible. However, some members of Congress believe that this amendment is still premature because the Neutrality Act prohibits the United States from granting loans to warring countries, but in fact, both Britain and France can still purchase military supplies in the United States because these countries have sufficient financial resources to purchase various war supplies for at least the next two years. Therefore, there is no need to rush to amend the Neutrality Act to facilitate these countries. (Havas dispatch of the 28th)

Washington: Senator Pittman recently stated that he estimates that the Allied countries have sufficient financial resources to support two years of war without incurring foreign debt. He does not believe that the war will continue for two years. (Reuter's dispatch of the 28th)

### Internal Conflict Among Japan's Ruling Class: A Commentary from the Soviet Red Star Newspaper

Moscow: The Soviet Red Star newspaper today published an article detailing the internal conflicts within Japan's ruling class. The article stated, "The conflicts within Japan have intensified, and the government has repeatedly encountered crises. This fact proves that the Japanese ruling class cannot reach a consensus on either domestic or foreign policy. Japanese soldiers, military-industrial tycoons, adventurers, and speculators are all profiting from the war, and they naturally do not want to give up China or reduce the interests they have seized in China. On the other hand, 'liberals' oppose the continued warfare by the military clique in China. They believe that the Japanese army has no possibility of conquering all of China. At the same time, they pessimistically assess Japan's domestic economic resources and the value of Japanese imperialism. They all believe that without foreign capital, Japan will never be able to 'develop' the resources it has seized in China. The formation of the Yonai Cabinet proves that the conflict among the Japanese ruling class has become increasingly fierce, and the dissatisfaction and anti-war sentiment of the working masses have also intensified. The Japanese military and exploiters can no longer ignore this severe situation." (TASS dispatch from the 27th)

### Chiang Kai-shek and Wife Send Letter to Methodist Episcopal Church Joint Conference Expressing Thoughts on War: "The Root of War in China and Europe Lies in Human Selfishness and Greed"

Washington: British and French economic experts, including one named Gordon Lister, have been in discussions here with U.S. authorities regarding the blockade policy and mail inspection issues for quite some time. It has now been learned that after both sides made considerable concessions to each other, they have reached a mutually satisfactory agreement. In essence, the British and French sides have agreed that certain German-produced medicines that cannot be purchased elsewhere should be considered exceptions and allowed to be imported into the United States as usual, without being restricted by the British and French blockade policy. (Havas dispatch from the 27th)

Washington: The mission of the British and French commercial commissioners in the United States concluded yesterday with a statement issued by British Commissioner Ashton-Gwatkin. Ashton-Gwatkin also told the press that Britain and France could engage in wartime trade with the United States without significant friction. U.S. Secretary of State Hull has stated twice that Britain and France have given special consideration to the blockade of German goods being shipped to the U.S., and that the blockade of goods that only Germany can supply, such as eyeglasses and precious objects, will be carefully considered. However, Secretary of Agriculture Wallace said in a speech in St. Paul yesterday that Britain and France aim to purchase the goods they need from countries that can meet their demands, and the United States is one of the countries they are focusing on. However, the British and French commissioners in the United States have not achieved great success. At the same time, Britain and France also hope that the U.S. Congress will relax restrictions on belligerent countries in terms of goods and credit. Regarding the bill authorizing President Roosevelt to suspend payments of Norwegian and Danish deposits in the United States to prevent them from falling into German hands, a fierce debate erupted after Senator Connally from the Republican Party proposed an amendment to the bill in order to eliminate the president's power to suspend settlement payments.

### Danish Ships Sailing on the High Seas: Britain Has the Right to Intercept According to International Law

London: British Minister of Shipping Hudson gave a speech in Southampton today, clarifying Britain's attitude towards Danish shipping. He said that in practice, ships flying the Danish flag can be requisitioned by the Danish government. Since we have driven German merchant ships from the sea, how can we sit idly by and watch ships flying the Danish flag, but controlled by Germany, replace German ships without taking action? According to international law, we have the right to arrest Danish captains on the high seas and treat them as legitimate prizes. Therefore, we are willing to rent Danish ships at a reasonable price, provided that they change to the British and French flags and that the rental fees do not flow into Germany.

### British and German Troops in Stalemate in Stenkjer District of Central Norway: German Troops Advance Across Mountain Paths from Røros: Norwegian Troops Forced to Abandon Steinkjer

London: The War Office recently issued a communiqué stating: (1) There have been no major changes in the positions of enemy and our forces north of Steinkjer in central Norway. Our patrol units have been quite active and have captured several enemy soldiers. (2) In the Gudbrandsdal region, the enemy launched a fierce attack on Allied forces in Kvam, but was repelled with heavy losses. However, the pressure on the Allied forces from the enemy has not decreased as a result. German air forces continue to bomb Allied supply lines and bases in the rear. (3) Nothing of note has occurred in the Narvik area. (Havas dispatch from the 27th)

London: The newspapers here today continue to comment on the war in Norway, acknowledging that this is the beginning of a long-term war. The enemy has been planning to invade Northern Europe for some time. After this sudden dispatch of troops, they immediately occupied various airfields according to their planned and deployed strong air forces. They have been able to bomb the Allied forces of Britain, France, and Norway at will because of this. However, the British and French Allied forces have now hastily built many temporary airfields to allow their air forces to take off and land to meet the enemy. It is hoped that they can immediately send a strong land and air force to help in the battle. (Havas dispatch from the 28th)

Stockholm: Colonel Barrera, a famous Spanish military commentator, recently spoke to a Reuters reporter about the situation in the Norwegian war, saying that even if the German army could break through the Østerdalen valley, pass through Storlien and reach Trondheim, the transportation facilities through Dombås would have to be occupied by the Allied powers for this connection to be maintained. Therefore, the landing of troops in Åndalsnes and the occupation of the railway to Dombås are the main military features. It is expected that the German army will do everything possible to cut off this communication and occupy Dombås. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)

### German Planes Bomb British Ships: Communiqué States Multiple Hits: British Air Force Attacks German Airfields

Berlin: A German military headquarters communiqué states that on the night of the 26th, the British air force bombed Narvik. The German air force continued to bomb enemy troops landing in Harstad and Åndalsnes. A British cruiser was hit by heavy bombs near Narvik. A British anti-aircraft cruiser near Åndalsnes was hit by several bombs and heavily damaged. Two British troop transport ships sank in Molde Bay (totaling 12,000 tons). Four other troop transport ships (totaling 23,000 tons) were severely damaged. One British aircraft was shot down in the North Sea, and two others were destroyed on the ground. One German aircraft is missing. No significant events occurred on the Western Front. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)

Stockholm: Several British aircraft attacked the German-occupied Fornebu airfield in Norway yesterday, bombing it heavily and destroying several German aircraft. Several more crashed into trees while trying to escape and were also severely damaged. In addition, the German authorities ordered civil servants in Oslo, Norway, to go to Fredrikstad to build an airfield. At the same time, the airfield in the suburbs of the city will also be expanded. (Havas dispatch from the 28th)

### German War Report

Berlin: A communiqué from the German military headquarters this afternoon stated that in the past 24 hours, German forces have continued to achieve victories in Norway. Although Norwegian troops attempted to resist, the German army, with the assistance of the air force, was invincible. German aircraft were extremely active, not only bombing enemy troops and supply routes in the front, but also attacking enemy troops in the rear to demoralize them. Many enemies were captured yesterday, including one British colonel. After the German army occupied Voss near Bergen, the isolated Norwegian forces in that area fled into the mountains. In the Stavanger area, the number of prisoners has increased greatly, totaling 241 officers (including British pilots) and 2,921 soldiers. In this area, 22 artillery pieces, 267 machine guns, and countless other military supplies were seized. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)

### Germany Appoints Administrative Chief for Occupied Areas of Norway: Directly Responsible to Hitler

Berlin: Yesterday morning, the German government gazette disclosed an order from Führer Hitler appointing Josef Terboven as the administrative chief of the German-occupied areas of Norway. The declarations and military actions taken by the Norwegian government have placed the two countries in a state of war. The German government has decided to establish an administrative chief in the Norwegian territories it has occupied to protect the lives and security of the public. The administrative chief has supreme jurisdiction over all administrative matters and has the power to organize a Norwegian governing committee or appoint Norwegian civil servants. The German commander in Norway will be the military commander (similar to a pacification commissioner). The administrative chief will directly receive instructions from the German Führer and is responsible to the Führer. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)

### British War Office Denies Senior Officer Captured

London: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop mentioned yesterday that a British brigade commander had been captured. The British War Office now refutes this claim, saying that no British brigade commander or staff has been captured in the Norwegian campaign. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)

Berlin: The British side denies the news that a member of the staff of a British brigade was captured by the German army. Journalists here expect the German propaganda department to invite foreign journalists to meet with the captured British officer. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)

### Allied Forces Vow to Fight Hard for the Liberation of the Norwegian People: Broadcast Speech by British Air Minister Hoare: Denounces Ribbentrop's Remarks as Despicable

London: British Air Minister Hoare recently gave a broadcast speech to respond to the remarks of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, saying, "All I can say is that the claim that Britain had conspired to invade a neutral country is an utterly despicable lie, and this lie, coming from the mouth of those who destroyed Czechoslovakia and Poland, is particularly disgusting. Ribbentrop is an adventurous and insidious figure who has done great harm in public affairs. No upright gentleman takes his words seriously, and no impartial neutral believes them. We will ignore his lies and turn to the crimes committed by Hitler and Ribbentrop in Norway. They have made Norway a battlefield, forcing us to fight on a new front. We accept their challenge. We must use all the material resources we can develop and all the people we can gather to confront the enemy in this area. Let us not have any illusions. The war has now entered a tense and important stage. The enemy will do everything possible to fight without restraint and will not give us any rest. Hitler, disregarding everything, has dragged the Norwegian people, who have lived in peace for generations, into the war. Hitler has no regard for the loyal and courageous people of Norway, and we do not want to imitate him. We do not want to drown helpless sailors, nor do we want to bomb undefended cities, nor do we want to defeat the Germans by terrorizing German women and children. But we do not want to allow Hitler to monopolize the advantages in energy, skill, and determination. We must show that our qualities far exceed those shown by Mr. Hitler. We pay no attention to any threats made by Mr. Hitler. We now have a responsibility that must be fulfilled. The Allied forces must gradually recapture the Norwegian ports and air bases in German hands, and must place the people of Norway, who have been invaded, in a position to have weapons and power that will drive the enemy beyond the valleys and harbors. But our current work, to speak in detail, is by no means easy. This cannot be accomplished overnight without sacrifice. We must now fight hard, with aggressive actions and persistent plans, to regain the advantages gained by Germany through its despicable and shameful attacks."

Hoare continued to speak to the Norwegian people, saying, "The largest British navy in the world, the strongest French army in the world, and the most technologically advanced and courageous British and French air forces in the world are now the guarantors of your liberation. We rejoice in the heroic leadership given by your King Haakon VII, and at the side of King Haakon is Admiral Evans, who upholds the maritime traditions that both the Norwegian and British peoples cherish. Britain rules the seas, and Norway relies on the sea for its livelihood. The freedom of Norway and the future of Britain are tied to the sea, and this will be made even more secure in the future. The Norwegian coastal batteries have assisted the British navy, and the British navy has also given the enemy an undeniable blow. The Battle of Narvik was not only characterized by courage, but also achieved complete success. The German fleet had no time to hide and was completely destroyed. Even if the Norwegian war situation has not yet been determined in other respects, this battle is indeed a result that has been achieved. The German navy is no longer a major weapon, and the enemy has lost so many warships that Britain is now freer to use its ships to meet strategic and defense needs. The British land, sea, and air forces have also achieved excellent results in the past half-month and have demonstrated their amazing ability to bomb enemy bases on the Scandinavian Peninsula. The air bases in Stavanger, Kristiansand, Aalborg, Oslo, Trondheim, and Vestlandet have all been bombed and severely damaged. This is the achievement made by the British air force in fierce resistance, and the British air force is now prepared to undertake even greater tasks. The British government is determined not to slacken in its determination to maintain its superiority at sea and in the sky, and the British government and people are determined to achieve this goal. The British power that is flying in the Arctic Ocean today will eventually bring us back to peace with the honor of free people and the victory of noble ideals." (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)

### Reactions in Various Countries to German Foreign Minister's Speech

Paris: According to telegrams received here from various sources, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's speech has been met with derision by people in Hungary, the Netherlands, and Belgium, with the exception of Italy, which predictably praised it. People in Hungarian political circles said that the country only pays attention to its own interests. Ribbentrop's speech did not involve Southeastern Europe, so it does not need to be given much importance. In addition, people in both Belgium and the Netherlands said that Ribbentrop's intention was to prove to the people of those countries that the dispatch of troops to Northern Europe was justified. However, whether his white paper, which accused Britain and France of preparing to invade Norway, is true is still doubtful. (Havas dispatch from the 28th)

Concealing Aggression is Counterproductive

London: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's remarks and the recent publication of the German white paper have not caused surprise in official circles here. Germany always finds many important documents unfavorable to any country it expands its so-called sphere of protection to. These shocking facts are only a laughingstock. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)

London: Today's leading Sunday newspapers have all published articles refuting German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's statements in his radio address in Berlin yesterday about the Allied plan to invade Norway. The Observer's diplomatic correspondent stated that it is no longer necessary to review past events to refute Mr. Ribbentrop's remarks, because people outside of Germany are familiar with them. One noteworthy question is why Mr. Ribbentrop invited the diplomatic corps to listen to his speech. Presumably, Mr. Ribbentrop's intention was to use this to strengthen the confidence of the people in his country. The Sunday Times stated that neutral countries are unlikely to readily believe Mr. Ribbentrop's claim that Britain had long prepared to invade Norway, so as to have a pretext for attacking Norway, because facts speak louder than words. Mr. Ribbentrop is following Germany's most despicable traditional methods, attempting to blame Norway, just as he did to Belgium during the First World War. In fact, both of these innocent countries strictly adhered to neutrality, and Germany used their neutrality to invade them. Afterwards, it added trumped-up charges to cover up its own actions. The most foolish of Mr. Ribbentrop's remarks was that Allied politicians conspired to seize Norway. For example, he cited British Foreign Secretary Halifax's warning to neutral countries not to request British assistance too late. Mr. Halifax did say that, but he did not threaten any British side. What Mr. Halifax predicted and mentioned was the threat of German action. Does this matter not sufficiently explain the accuracy of his prediction today? The rest of Mr. Ribbentrop's citations can all be explained in this way. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)

Believed to be Aimed at Sweden

Paris: Political figures here have recently commented on the speech made by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, saying that this speech is obviously aimed at Sweden. It harshly attacked Norway and praised Sweden, which is quite ulterior in motive. This is no different from the period of Czechoslovakia's crisis in September 1938, when Germany attacked Czechoslovakia on the one hand and allied with Poland on the other. At this time, Germany has adopted the same strategy for the Scandinavian Peninsula, for Germany knows that Sweden has taken various precautionary measures, and it will inevitably encounter great difficulties if it launches a rash attack. Therefore, it wants to appease Sweden and make it negligent in its defense, and even demobilize part of its army, so that it will be easier to attack Sweden in the future. In addition, it is also noteworthy that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's speech avoids mentioning Denmark, which was completely invaded. (Havas dispatch from the 27th)

Italy Actually Defends Germany

Rome: Political circles here yesterday believed that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's statement was Germany's first serious legal offensive, hoping to avoid the stigma of being labeled with "war guilt" as it was after the previous European war. (United Press dispatch from the 28th)

Rome: The German government's white paper and news of the battle of Trondheim, Norway, have been transmitted here by various newspapers. In their commentary on the Scandinavian Peninsula war, they all took an extremely pessimistic view of the positions of Britain and France and wanted to make the general public believe that Britain and France had aggressive intentions towards neutral countries, thereby showing that the alliance between Germany and Italy had become more concrete. (Havas dispatch from the 28th)

Germany Repeats 20-Year-Old Tricks

Norway: Chicago German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's speech yesterday was refuted by Norwegian Minister to the US Morgenstierne, who said that Germany's invasion of Norway this time was exactly the same as the invasion of Belgium by German troops in 1914. Since the outbreak of the European war, our country has always strictly adhered to neutrality. Previously, when our country's neutral status was repeatedly violated, we protested simultaneously to Britain, France, and Germany. The cases of the German auxiliary ship "Altmark" and the American cargo ship "City of Flint" are clear evidence of this. Mr. Ribbentrop's claim that Norway had any conspiracy with a certain country can be refuted without attack. (Havas dispatch from the 28th)

U.S. Anti-Aggression Stance Unchanged

United States: Washington, Regarding German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's "dramatic speech," political figures here have commented that the U.S. holds a condemnatory view of any act of aggression, and a speech will not change the situation. President Roosevelt explained the U.S.'s position in the current European war in a speech on the 13th of this month. As for Ribbentrop's claim that the British Admiralty had already prepared a plan to invade Norway, this is not worth a smile and does not need to be refuted. (Havas dispatch from the 27th)

### Another Display of Disregard for Reason

New York: The New York report stated that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's remarks on Norway yesterday were an insult to the reason of the whole world. The New York Times stated that the world will know how to choose between the English and Norwegian side on the one hand and Germany, which has repeatedly broken its promises, on the other. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch also stated that Ribbentrop had made a display of disregard for all reason. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)

### Not Just the Self-Defense of a Murderer

New York. Ribbentrop, the German Foreign Minister's speech yesterday, has now been commented upon by this morning's newspapers. The New York Times stated, "This purely dramatized statement, if one seeks its explanation, can be found in the solemn speech given by Führer Hitler hours before declaring war on Norway. In essence, Germany attempted to destroy Norway's resistance, but this barbaric act has already failed. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop therefore had no choice but to deliver yesterday's speech to shirk responsibility. That is all. In short, the word 'sincerity' has now been fundamentally shaken. People should know how to choose between the promises made by England and France, and the promises made by Germany." The New York Herald Tribune, under the title "The Defense of a Murderer," briefly stated, "Hitler wants us to acknowledge this defense, to regard the heinous crime committed by one country against another as justifiable. Is this even possible?" (Havas News Agency, 28th)

### The Intentions of German Military Activity are Unfathomable. Sweden Remains Vigilant, and Doubts are Not Alleviated by Germany's Declaration.

Stockholm. Sweden has implemented various precautionary measures to prevent attacks, including curbing the activities of foreign spies. Foreigners are only allowed to travel by public transport, and there are many places foreigners are not permitted to enter. A national defense force has been established, and one of its duties is to arrest those who parachute from the sky. Air raid precautions are evident throughout the country. (Reuters News Agency, 28th)

Stockholm. German newspapers have recently often criticized Sweden, claiming that, judging from Swedish newspaper opinions, Sweden has not adhered to the strict neutrality that Germany expects. However, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop suddenly made a statement yesterday saying that Germany is satisfied with Sweden's neutral position and neutral behavior. Swedish people found this very strange. If Germany is satisfied with Sweden's neutrality, then what is the purpose of Germany's military preparations in Memel and other East Prussian ports on the Baltic Sea, and the frequent appearance of German aircraft in Swedish airspace? Therefore, Swedish people cannot dispel their doubts based on the German Foreign Minister's words alone. Some believe that Germany's statement regarding Sweden is directed at the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union has stated that while it is willing to remain an observer regarding the events in Norway and the occupation of Denmark, if Sweden is involved, the Soviet Union will have no choice but to intervene. (Reuters News Agency, 28th)

### British Aircraft Have Never Bombed Undefended Cities. German Propaganda Has Had an Effect.

London. Sources here claim that German radio stations are now spreading lies about British aircraft bombing non-military targets. The German tactics have long been known. The reason for fabricating these rumors is nothing more than to prepare to carry out bombing actions and blame them on Britain. In fact, British aircraft have never bombed undefended cities or non-military targets. (Reuters News Agency, 28th)

Amsterdam. According to reports here, the German Propaganda Bureau notified newspapers at the end of this week to intensify their campaign denouncing British bombing of undefended cities in Norway and Germany, in order to create public opinion so that Germany can take retaliatory action against Britain at any time. (Reuters News Agency, 28th)

### British Foreign Secretary Meets with Italian Ambassador. Treasury Representative Returns to London.

London. The "Sunday Times" recently reported that Foreign Secretary Halifax met with the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Bastianini, for half an hour yesterday, but the content is unknown. In addition, Mr. Playfair, a representative of the British Treasury, went to Rome several weeks ago, after the resolution of the Anglo-Italian coal dispute, for official business and returned to London yesterday. (Havas News Agency, 27th)

### The Italian Ambassador to Germany is Rumored to be Replaced.

Rome. News last night indicated that the Italian Ambassador to Germany, Attolico, will be recalled home, and the current Ambassador to the Holy See in Rome, Alfieri, will be transferred to be the Ambassador to Germany. The reasons for the replacement are not yet fully known, but some believe that Attolico's return home may be beneficial to Italy. Mr. Attolico has considerable experience in European affairs. He once served as the Ambassador to Moscow, and was transferred to Berlin after 1935. (United Press, 28th)

### The 9th Supreme Military Conference Held Between Britain and France. Britain, France, Poland, and Norway Share the Same Views. Decision Made to Establish Air Force Base within Norwegian Territory.

Paris. It was officially announced that the Supreme Defense Council of Britain and France held its ninth joint meeting at 2:30 PM today at the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street in London. The French side was represented by Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Reynaud, Minister of National Defense Daladier, Minister of the Navy Campinchi, Minister of Aviation Laurent-Eynac, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces General Gamelin, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Vice Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force General Vuillemin, and French Ambassador to Britain Corbin. The British side was represented by Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill, Secretary of State for War Stanley, Secretary of State for Air Sir Kingsley Wood, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Sir Alexander Cadogan, Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Newall, First Sea Lord Admiral Pound, and Chief of the Imperial General Staff General Ironside. Representatives from Poland and Norway also participated. Various issues arising from the current situation were discussed, proving that the views of the allied countries were completely consistent. Whatever events may occur in the future, they are fully prepared. (Havas News Agency, 27th)

London. The Supreme Defense Council of Britain and France held its ninth joint meeting here yesterday. According to well-informed sources, the meeting discussed the war situation in Norway, paying particular attention to the setbacks suffered by the Allied forces in the areas south of Dombås and around Åndalsnes in Norway. The Allied forces landing in Norway acted very swiftly. The current need is for fighter squadrons to counter the attacks of German bomber squadrons. Therefore, various methods have been decided upon to establish air force bases within Norwegian territory. In addition, the meeting also discussed how to accelerate the supply of military supplies and how to coordinate the actions of the British and French Allied forces. (Havas News Agency, 28th)

Paris. Responsible sources here stated that the goal of the ninth joint meeting of the Supreme Defense Council of Britain and France, held in London yesterday, was to make all necessary military decisions regarding the Norwegian situation, and to study the countermeasures that Britain, France, Norway, and Poland would always take in response to future events. Observers here generally believe that this joint meeting is a response to the speech given by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop yesterday, as the previous joint meeting, held in Paris on the 23rd of this month, unanimously decided that if Romania and Greece were to be invaded, Britain and France should immediately intervene, and that if British and French interests were threatened elsewhere, they should also rise to defend them. At a time when Germany is trying to politically and militarily isolate Sweden, the aforementioned decision by Britain and France is of great significance. Germany's current attitude towards Sweden is exactly the same as its attitude towards Poland during the Czechoslovakian crisis in September 1938. This is because the Swedish people are steadfast in their position and are determined not to be exploited by Germany, and Britain and France should also pay close attention to this situation. (Havas News Agency, 28th)

### Contents of the German White Paper (Continued from Yesterday) Revealing the Inside Story of British Military Operations in Norway

The Consul is still asked to remain in Narvik and be responsible for managing the naval affairs of Narvik. No. TORO-930-7-4, No. TOO-1925, April 6, 1940. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)

Section 3. This section consists of the orders from the head of the British Admiralty's Annex Bureau to the British Consul in Narvik, as well as the letter from the British Naval Attaché in Sweden to the British Consul in Narvik on February 14, 1940. The translations are as follows: (1) "Letter from the Swedish Attaché to the Consul" Dear Consul Cableton, I am introducing my confidential secretary, Maxton, to pay you a visit, carrying a large group of questions, by order of the Admiralty, for prompt reply. Please have Smith secretly carry the reply to Sweden to obtain a valid Swedish passport for four days, as the journey takes two days. Please also urge caution. All news will be reported in person by Maxton. Signed, John Bohman. (2) "Order from the Head of the Intelligence Department of the Admiralty to the Narvik Consul, January 31, 1940." The following questions are to be reported back as soon as possible, but in conducting the investigation, do not arouse local suspicion. Signed, Coke, Head of Intelligence Department.

The most important of the questions mentioned in the above two official documents are the following five: (1) Can the latest plans for Narvik port be obtained locally? (2) What is the defense of Narvik like? (a) Is the statement that there are five cannons in Afjord Bay reliable, and where are they located? (b) What is the caliber and range of the cannons? (c) Is it true that Narvik's defense consists of four anti-aircraft guns on mobile platforms? (d) Is it reliable that Narvik will be protected by twenty coastal ships? (3) Please provide detailed reports on coastal reconnaissance, landings, etc. (4) Is it easy to make the railway between Narvik and Riksgränsen go on strike? (5) Are there any ships in Kirkenes laying in wait to lay mines?

Section 4. The content is an excerpt from the letter from the French Naval Attaché in Oslo to the Commander of the Fifth Fleet of the French Navy, which contains information on the passage of troops through Norway, and discusses questions 1 to 40 in the letter dated January 29, 1940. The letter states briefly that telegrams No. 1058 of January 26, 1940 and No. 1187 of January 31 have been received. Regarding question 5, the Norwegian route, although Bergen port has the advantage of rapid landing, the Norwegian officers proposed the issue of the route, taking the Finnish military transport as an example, due to the great length of the railway and the difficulty of transportation. Norwegian officers generally believe that only Trondheim Bay and Narvik port are most suitable for this military action. Regarding the shipping conditions along Trondheim Bay, two points should be noted: (1) the conditions of the port of Trondheim itself; (2) the conditions of the ports along Trondheim Bay. Levanger is fifty miles from Trondheim and is located along the railway line directly to Stockholm. There is an excellent deep-water dock, which can be said to be an ideal place for secret landings. Wood pulp, the raw material for papermaking, is often loaded and unloaded in this port.

### US Assistant Secretary of War Discusses the Strength of the US Army. Sufficient to Guarantee US Security. Does Not Wish to Send Troops to Europe to Participate in the War. Large-Scale Army Exercises Under Preparation.

Clarksburg, USA. US Assistant Secretary of War Johnson stated here yesterday that the current strength of the US Army is "sufficient to guarantee the security of the United States. We do not wish to send an expeditionary force to Europe to participate in the war. I believe that everyone will agree on this point." Johnson stated that the current strength of the US Army is 227,000 enlisted personnel and 13,000 officers, and the National Guard is 235,000 and 15,000 officers. This is the largest strength in the US during peacetime in history, but compared with other countries in the world, it ranks only twentieth. The purpose of the US Army is to maintain the garrisons of Hawaii, the Philippines, and other territories, thereby protecting the naval facilities in these places, protecting the US mainland from invasion, and preparing a basic army for expansion in times of emergency.

### Fujian Province Improves Wartime Transportation, with "Sustained Transportation" as the Main Principle

Fuzhou Correspondence – Since the blockade of seaports and the destruction of highways in Fujian Province, the entry and exit of ships have mostly adopted guerrilla tactics, with no fixed berthing locations. Cargo transportation has been switched to manual labor. The provincial transportation company, in order to adapt to the needs, has specially established a manual labor transportation office in Fuzhou to oversee manual transportation matters. It has also jointly organized two transportation companies, Minnan and Mindong, with merchants. The Mindong Transportation Company operates three routes: Fuzhou to Wanyao in Ningde County, Fuzhou to Danyang in Lianjiang County, and Ningde to Gukou in Gutian County. The Minnan Transportation Company operates three routes: Fuzhou to Hanjiang in Putian County, Hanjiang to Quanzhou, and Xianyou to Yongtai. After cargo is unloaded from ships, it is carried by workers to its destination. The stipulated freight charges are distributed as follows: 84% to the carriers, 3% to the foremen, and the remaining 13% to cover management fees and all other expenses. The above applies to the coastal areas. In the inland areas, the provincial transportation company has established a separate shipping department, deciding to loan money to boat owners to build 1,500 sailboats to operate on the four routes of Yanping, Shaxian, and Yong'an; Yanping, Jian'ou, and Pucheng; Yanping, Shunchang, Shaowu, and Guangze; Yanping, Jiangle, Taining, and Jianning, in order to enhance water transportation tools on the upper reaches of the Min River. Recently, the transportation company also convened a meeting of the directors of the manual labor and shipping departments, as well as the heads of various land and water transportation sections, to determine the future direction of business, with the principle of maintaining "sustained transportation," conserving automobile consumption, and developing manual labor, handcarts, sailboats, and other businesses to compensate for the inadequacy of automobile transportation, strengthening land and water intermodal transportation, supplying military and civilian public transportation, and striving for rapid, convenient, and safe transportation within the scope possible, in order to fulfill the mission of wartime transportation.

### Zhejiang Construction Department Prepares to Trial-Produce Camphor, Requisitioning Camphor Trees in Lishui

Lishui Correspondence – The Construction Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, in order to enrich the resources for the war of resistance, has decided to conduct a trial production of camphor. It has specially requisitioned camphor trees in the areas of Shuinan and Tianjingling in this county. The price-giving method and standards have been submitted to the provincial government for approval, referring to the established practices of Fujian Province and the materials obtained from the survey of camphor tree production in various counties. It is proposed that high-quality camphor trees (pure white flesh) be priced at 70 yuan per meter in diameter, medium-quality (yellowish) at 60 yuan, and low-quality (reddish) at 50 yuan. Hollow and rotten ones will be reduced in price. According to these regulations, camphor trees in Tianjingling and Shuinan will be priced separately, and the county government will receive and distribute the funds.

### Ancient Temples in Jiangyin Devastated by the Japanese Army; Old Trees Felled for Fuel

Jiangyin Correspondence – Xingguo Temple, located on Nanjie in the west gate of the city, was built in the Han Dynasty and is a famous ancient temple. Originally, there were more than 5,000 rooms, but they were destroyed in the war. In the temple, there was a seven-story pagoda, which was said to have been built by Lady Wu, the mother of Sun Quan, during the Chiwu period of the Three Kingdoms. The pagoda was also destroyed by fire. In 1924, during the Zhili-Fengtian War, the top of the pagoda was hit by a cannon from Huangshan Mountain, destroying a corner and turning it into a pen nib shape. For thousands of years, it has remained a relic for future generations to admire. There were only a few rooms of flat houses for the Buddha statue and monks' quarters. An old monk, Zhihong, maintained the incense fire. The old foundation was very wide, measuring dozens of acres. It was surrounded by short walls, and nearby residents planted soybeans and wheat, forming a plant enclosure. Inside, the trees were lush, with many old trees hundreds of years old. Since the fall of Jiangyin, the remaining houses in the temple have been preserved by the old monk. The pagoda is filled with bird nests. Every evening, as the sun sets, the birds return, and the sounds of birds are noisy, creating a grand spectacle. The Japanese soldiers often shoot at the birds for fun, and some even risk climbing on the dilapidated ancient pagoda to catch birds, and some have fallen to the ground and died. Recently, due to the high price of firewood and the lack of fuel, the trees in the garden have been almost completely felled. The soybeans, wheat, and firewood planted have been repeatedly damaged. The ancient temple has been devastated.

### Song Dynasty Stone Carvings Discovered in Taiping Lane, Suzhou; Bridge Railings from the Fifth Year of Qingli

Suzhou Correspondence – Suzhou is a place where cultural relics from the southeast gather, and the remains of former sages are well preserved. Since its fall, the losses have been enormous. Although those who care have tried their best to collect the remnants after the disaster, unfortunately, those with historical value have all flowed to the three islands. Recently, in front of Guangsheng Nunnery in Xiaotaiping Lane, west of Dalang Bridge on Lindun Road in the city, two stone railings erected by Cao Wennai, a resident of Fengchi Township, Changzhou County, and his wife Xia Sansanniang in the fifth year of Qingli of the Northern Song Dynasty, were suddenly discovered. The characters are exquisite and highly valuable for research on local history and evolution. A gentleman from Wuxian County has taken steps to preserve them. The fifth year of Qingli is now 895 years ago. The font of this stone inscription closely resembles that of Huang Tingjian, and the wording is very similar to the epitaphs of the Six Dynasties. It is truly a treasure of Suzhou's documents.

### The Japanese Army Establishes a Fake Military Officer Training Institute in Shantou, Intending to Use Fake Military Officers to Control Fake Troops

Shantou Correspondence – The pseudo-peacekeeping forces in the Chaoshan area are composed of smugglers, bandits, and pirates, with absolutely no military discipline to speak of. On weekdays, they gather in opium dens and gambling houses or extort and rob peddlers and merchants. When they encounter battles, three or five of them escape with guns, or the entire team surrenders. Since last year, more than six or seven thousand have escaped or surrendered. Therefore, the Japanese military authorities have completely lost confidence in the pseudo-troops. In February, they dispersed them to Chao'an, Chenghai, Nan'ao, and Xiamen for individual training, rotating them for training in a cycle, but it was still ineffective. In mid-March, the Japanese side transferred more than a thousand young pseudo-troops from the Northeast. They are physically strong and of better quality, all of them being good rural youths who were oppressed and transported to Chaoshan. Since arriving in Shantou, they have disobeyed orders. Every time a battle is decided, they always fire into the sky first, sending a signal, indicating that Chinese people do not fight Chinese people. The Japanese side felt that there was a lack of lower-level cadres in the pseudo-troops, making it difficult to control them. Therefore, they instigated the pseudo "Guangdong East Pacification Commissioner's Office" to establish a pseudo-army training institute, recruiting 50 students for the officer class and 200 for the soldier class in Shantou. The qualifications for the officer class require a degree of graduation from a secondary school or above, and the age must be between 20 and 35 to be eligible. The soldier class requires a degree of graduation from a primary school. The admission conditions require a guarantee from a Japanese military police captain or a pseudo-county magistrate or district chief to be eligible. Applicants must fill out a application form, identity certificate, resume, and photo to the pseudo-Commissioner's Office. The registration period is from April 1st to 18th, and the examination will be held at 9:00 AM on the 20th. After three months of graduation, they will be assigned to the pseudo-troops as lower-level cadres. However, it is said that there are very few applicants.

### Andrology: The Seriousness and Treatment of Lower Back Pain, Forgetfulness, and Insomnia

— Written by Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

Regarding the occurrence of lower back pain, it is mostly caused by overwork. This is because the various tissues of the whole body are gradually damaged due to overwork, until they reach the point of being unusable – hence the outbreak of this condition.

In addition, it is caused by indulgence in sensual pleasures, with middle-aged patients being the most numerous. This is because excessive indulgence consumes sperm and blood, weakens the function of metabolism, forming the image of premature aging. The brain, kidneys, and spinal cord suffer from various pathological conditions. Lower back pain is just one symptom of weakness. All parts of the body are almost completely deficient, such as nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, brain weakness, insomnia, forgetfulness, and other symptoms, which are almost completely encompassed. This is truly serious!

People who are weak in energy and indulge in sensual pleasures mostly cannot escape the above symptoms. Their spirits are depressed, and their mental strength is particularly sluggish. They cannot pay attention to anything they encounter, resulting in seeing and forgetting, and their consciousness is confused. They feel pain in their spirits, and if they do not seek treatment quickly, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not shorten their lifespan.

In summary, the above-mentioned diseases will never occur in those who are not neurasthenic. To study the main root cause, one must first prevent masturbation in youth, because after masturbation, the prostate gland is destroyed, and nocturnal emission is inevitable, causing the body's sperm to dry up, directly affecting the health of the whole body. Especially harmful is mental masturbation, because mental masturbation relies only on unnatural fantasies, concentrating everything on one point, so it is very easy to weaken attention and reasoning ability. Therefore, young people who have the above bad habits must quit them quickly.

If one has the above symptoms in youth, happiness is completely lost. The method of treatment must be fundamentally considered. The fundamental method of treatment is to first restore the prostate gland to its original state, and then the function of metabolism will be vigorous, the blood will be sufficient, and the brain will be active. Memory will naturally be enhanced. I am a specialist in venereal diseases and know that the best of the prostate gland hormone preparations is "Buti Kang." This is because "Buti Kang" contains not only the prostate gland hormone of strong animals but also phosphorus to nourish the brain, iron to nourish the blood, and calcium to nourish the bones. It is divided into two types for men and women. The female type functions to regulate menstruation and seeds, treating anemia, premature aging, flat breasts, and loss of health, which is most effective.

### Gonorrhea Spring and Autumn: Destroying the Nests of Gonococci

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, Medical Doctor of the United States

Yue Wumu of the Song Dynasty had a very heroic saying, which was "Strike directly at Huanglong." Huanglong was the base of the Jin Dynasty. Eliminating it was the fundamental solution. Unfortunately, the effort failed, causing eternal regret. This shows that to succeed, a fundamental solution must be found. In terms of gonorrhea, gonorrhea patients often do not pay attention to it because the disease is temporarily hidden. All actions are no different from when they were not sick. As a result, it occurs and heals repeatedly, and the disease becomes increasingly worse, until it is beyond control. Therefore, those who are good at treating gonorrhea must be good at treating its root, and the root of gonorrhea must be eradicated. Any recurring disease must have its root cause not removed, and this is especially true for gonorrhea that recurs again and again. Therefore, I believe that it is not difficult to make gonorrhea temporarily hidden on the surface. What is difficult is how to strike directly at the nest of germs. Fortunately, science now has a high rate of development, and a safe solution has been found for such difficult problems. Originally, Dr. Peter, a German master of gonorrhea, with more than 30 years of experience, invented the "Clinone" (sold by Zhongying Pharmacy), a mixed preparation using protein and yellow pigment. Over the years, this agent has been proven effective by experiments by major famous doctors around the world. Its efficacy exceeds all ordinary chemical therapies, because this agent uses the principle of non-specific therapy and has been continuously improved and succeeded. Its efficacy can produce anti-gonococcal phagocytosis within a few hours after taking it. Whether it is early-stage gonorrhea or chronic gonorrhea, it can be quickly cured. This is because although gonococci have a strong reproduction ability and escape to many places, they cannot resist the efficacy of "Clinone," which can directly attack the nest of gonococci, like a dragnet, and it is difficult to escape. Therefore, gonorrhea cured by "Clinone" never recurs, and there is no case of failure. As for external medicines, men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally to wash the urethra themselves according to the diagram and instructions. Women can use "Carder Snowland Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories, inserting one tablet every night before going to bed and washing it away in the morning, and the effect will be even more complete and rapid.

### Cured Cases of Nocturnal Emission and Kidney Deficiency

— Dr. Zheng Ting, Medical Doctor of Germany

The patient, Min Yunshan, is from Xiaoshan, Zhejiang, 24 years old, and lives in Dong Tangjia Lane, Shanghai. He came to my clinic for treatment last autumn. The condition he suffered from was as follows: He married at the age of 18, and his body was very weak. Moreover, he had masturbated before marriage. Although he was able to quit after marriage, his muscles were thin, his spirits were sluggish, nocturnal emissions still occurred, and he ejaculated prematurely during sex. Sometimes his erection was not very strong, and he had a tendency to lose semen upon seeing women. His kidney deficiency had reached its extreme. (Symptoms at the time of diagnosis) – Pulse 109 beats, auscultation varied, headache, tinnitus, severe symptoms of nocturnal emission, weight 93 pounds. Therefore, he has not had children after seven years of marriage. Moreover, if Mr. Min overworks during the day, seminal fluid will slip out instantly, his eyes are tired and dull, and his hair is sparse. He suffers from severe neurasthenia. (Treatment method) – He was given 15 minutes of electrotherapy every day, personally taught methods of health preservation, and prescribed the prostate gland hormone preparation "Buti Kang" for men to cultivate and replenish the losses, increase the prosperity of his kidneys, eliminate his neurasthenia, and restore his development. At the same time, he took three tablets of "Nair's Nocturnal Emission Tablets" before going to bed to consolidate the essence gate and stop his nocturnal emissions. After taking it for three months, all of Mr. Min's symptoms disappeared, his body was strong, his trunk gradually became firm, and his weight suddenly increased by seven pounds, which is sufficient to prove the efficacy of "Buti Kang" and its special success.

### The Seriousness of Cough

— Sheng Zaiqiang, Needler

Cough is the easiest disease to be ignored, the reason is that cough patients do not have any dangerous phenomenon for a while, so it has been delayed, and the cough has become more and more severe, and eventually it is irreparable.

From the real pathological point of view, coughing is the lung's way of excluding foreign invaders, which is a kind of resistance to insult. If anesthetics are used, they will reduce the resistance. According to my more than 20 years of experience and reference to the experimental reports of doctors from various countries, the lung disease special medicine "Bofei Nair" invented by German Dr. Thome has the most remarkable effect. No matter how stubborn and difficult to cure or coughing that will become tuberculosis, after taking "Bofei Nair", it can achieve the effect of relieving cough and resolving phlegm within three hours, and nourishing the lungs and preventing tuberculosis. Its effect is far above cod liver oil, which has been proven by doctors from various countries.

### New Language of Gonorrhea: The Causes and Consequences of Urethral Gonorrhea

— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road

Once infected with gonorrhea, the initial gonococci mostly parasitize in the anterior urethra. At this time, if the gonococci are swept away with the method of lightning speed, the gonococci that have not gained a foothold will have no way to struggle and will be wiped out in one fell swoop. However, if you do not try your best to eliminate this germ at this time, then all pathological changes will arise from this. Generally speaking, gonococci in the anterior urethra are commonly seen in the prodromal phase of gonorrhea. When it enters the acute phase from the prodromal phase, the gonococci are no longer confined to the anterior urethra, but also enter the posterior urethra. All changes become more numerous, and treatment is more difficult than in the prodromal phase. The reason why gonorrhea caused by gonococci in the anterior urethra is easy to eliminate is that the anterior urethra has no complex structure physiologically. Therefore, treatment is very easy. If the gonococci have invaded the posterior urethra, although treatment is more difficult, if the gonococci have not invaded the urinary system or the internal reproductive system, or the blood circulation system, radical cure is still not very difficult. However, if it has become gonococcal cystitis, prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, etc., it is equivalent to stating that the patient's gonorrhea has invaded these systems. Its treatment is not only more difficult than anterior urethritis, but also more difficult than posterior urethritis. All of these are the causes and consequences of untreated gonococcal urethritis. And the only therapy is to take the special chemical therapy drug for gonorrhea "Clinone" (available in Zhongying Pharmacies) to have the hope of eradicating it. Because if the gonococci are dispersed from the anterior urethra to the three major systems, the scope of the gonococci is vast, and it is absolutely impossible to use a single local surgery to complete the task of expelling gonorrhea. I also use German static electricity therapy to make the bactericidal power of "New Clinone" fully exerted. Consultation time: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 numbers will be given out every day for consultation. Each number will only cost 5 jiao and will be given a copy of "Complete Book on Venereal Diseases" worth one yuan.

### French Ambassador to China, Mr. Cosme, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon; French Soldiers Formed a Guard of Honor and Played Music to Welcome Him; Traffic Was Cut off on the Bund Due to Precautions

French Ambassador to China, Mr. Cosme, previously went to the authorities in Beijing and Nanjing to handle routine official business. He left Shanghai on November 10th of last year for Hong Kong, transferred to Hanoi, and took the Zhenyue Railway to Indochina. He stayed in the new capital for nearly half a year. Now, due to private matters in Shanghai that need to be handled, he arrived here at 11:30 AM yesterday. The ambassador's hair has turned gray. Yesterday, he was wearing a light gray suit and looked energetic, frequently nodding to those who welcomed him. After inspecting the guard of honor, he went to the embassy to rest with Consul General Baux de Bégard and his two daughters. The detailed situation is recorded as follows:

A Guard of Honor Was Formed and Arranged to Greet Him

The French Embassy in Shanghai had already received the ambassador's telegram reporting his arrival date. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, a guard of honor was formed at the French Mail Steamship Company pier at No. 9 on the Bund in the French Concession to welcome him. Led by Colonel Aisudite, the French Army Commander in Shanghai, the guard of honor was composed of French sailors, French army soldiers, and Vietnamese army soldiers. They stood in a square formation around the pier. There was also a band. However, due to the one-and-a-half-hour difference from the original arrival time, the people at the scene were all waiting anxiously.

Precautions on the Bund, Traffic Was Cut off

Along Avenue Edward VII on the Bund, up to the entrance of Taikoo Company, traffic was temporarily cut off from 9:00 AM yesterday morning. No Chinese or Western people or vehicles were allowed to pass. Those who needed to go from the Bund in the French Concession to the 16th Pier were rerouted to Rue de la Cathédrale and then to Avenue de la Mission. Along the Bund, additional Chinese and Vietnamese detectives were added to maintain order. In addition to trams, all eastbound vehicles were also prohibited from passing. Senior Western detectives from the French Concession Police Department were also dispatched yesterday to direct traffic on Avenue Edward VII and Avenue de la Mission.

The Ambassador Landed Amidst the Music

The ambassador arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 10:35 AM on the French Mail Steamship Company's "Felix Roussel". The ship docked at the Gongo Xiang Pier in Hongkou. The ambassador himself was welcomed to the company's pier on the Bund in the French Concession by a small launch dispatched by the shipping company. At 11:00 AM, the ambassador arrived at the pier amidst the welcoming music. He first shook hands with the French Consul General, Mr. Baux de Bégard, and Colonel Aisudite, the French Army Commander in Shanghai, as a greeting. The ambassador, holding a felt hat in his left hand, inspected the guard of honor at the scene from north to south, and then shook hands with friends as a greeting, which lasted about five minutes. He then went to rest at the embassy at No. 2 Avenue de la Mission with the French Consul General's wife and his two daughters.

Coming to Shanghai This Time to Handle Embassy Affairs

Those who went to welcome him yesterday included French Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Baux de Bégard, Mr. Auchi, French Army Commander in Shanghai, Colonel Aisudite, and the ambassador's two daughters, who also held red flowers in their hands to welcome him. A reporter from the Dazhong News Agency visited Ambassador Cosme at the French Embassy at No. 2 Avenue de la Mission yesterday afternoon. Mr. Cosme, due to the fatigue of the journey, appointed Secretary Pelletier to meet with the reporter. According to Mr. Pelletier, "The ambassador has no mission this time. Because he has been separated from his wife and children for a long time, he has come to reunite and handle embassy affairs. Mr. Cosme previously suffered from dental disease and was unwell. He went to Hanoi for recuperation and stayed for ten days. He is now completely healthy. The ambassador arrived in Shanghai this morning with a very simple entourage. Only Secretary Charles Garnier accompanied him to Shanghai."

### Attack on Da Mei Newspaper Reported, Suspect Apprehended, No Weapons Found

The mainland press reports that after the machine room of the American Da Mei Evening News was attacked with hand grenades on the 27th, the French Concession Police Department has arrested a suspect, from whom clues may be discovered to solve the terrorist activities of recent months. The arrest of a suspect has been confirmed by the Police Department. It is said that after the crime occurred, police personnel searched for the perpetrators in the area and apprehended the suspect on Avenue du Consulat. According to informed sources, although no weapons were found on the suspect, he may have been stationed nearby by the perpetrators as a lookout. It is expected that the suspect will be interrogated thoroughly at the police station, and he will not be prosecuted in the Second Special District Court until the investigation is complete. In addition, during the attack, Phan Van Phuc, a Vietnamese constable, age 30, who had been working in the French Police Department for about two years, was killed. Last summer, he and other police officers engaged in a fierce gun battle with the attackers of the newspaper office at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Chang Geng Li. He unfortunately died in the line of duty this time. The funeral was held at the Xujiahui Public Cemetery at 3:00 PM on the 28th.

### Sir Victor Sassoon Returns to Shanghai from America, Arrives at 9 AM This Morning

Sir Victor Sassoon, a famous British financier in Shanghai, traveled to the United States to inspect business and stayed for several months. He has now returned to Shanghai on the American mail ship President Coolidge, which will arrive at 7:00 AM this morning (the 29th). He will transfer to the motor launch Mary Moller and is expected to disembark at the Jianghai Customs Wharf on the Bund at 9:00 AM. It is reported that while in the United States, Sir Victor Sassoon gave an interview to a reporter from the New York Herald Tribune on February 24, explaining the plight of Japan's domestic situation and criticizing Japan's actions in China. The Japanese side was extremely indignant about this and issued a statement through the so-called "Shanghai Jewish Community Association" under its control in an attempt to cover up the situation.

### Pork Shortage, Meat Market Closed

All butcher shops in the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession were closed yesterday morning due to lack of supply. It is understood that Shanghai needs 3,000 pigs per day. Recently, the pig-producing areas around Nantong have been monopolized by the Japanese, with heavy and endless taxes, making transportation to Shanghai very difficult. As a result, most pig vendors have ceased operations due to lack of profit. The source of supply to Shanghai is becoming increasingly scarce. The day before yesterday, there were only 800 to 900 pigs in all the pig markets. With numerous butcher shops in both settlements, the average distribution was less than one pig per shop, which was far from sufficient. The shops in the area of the extra-territorial road, such as Caojiadu, were still supplied as usual because they were within a special area. The remaining twenty-odd pigs were distributed to the butcher shops in the two settlements, which was not enough to meet the demand, so they had to close their doors and suspend business. In short, the current cost of goods has soared. Even if there are goods to sell, the losses would be too great. It is better to suspend business and only lose operating expenses. It is reported that yesterday's market price was a maximum of ten taels per yuan, or even seven or eight taels, and even wholesale among the same trades was only about one market catty per yuan. This suspension of business is entirely due to the shortage of goods. Whether the supply can resume today depends on the source.

### May Day Labor Holiday, Labor Community Celebrates the Holiday, Work Hard on Wartime Production in the Spirit of Collaboration, Hope Employers Improve Treatment Due to High Prices

On May Day, the labor community in Shanghai will, as usual, take a day off to celebrate. However, due to the special circumstances, activities such as gatherings and assemblies will be suspended. Holiday wages will still be paid by the employers. Chinese workers, as the country is in a time of war, are determined to work hard on wartime production in the spirit of labor-management collaboration. However, due to high prices and the rising cost of living, they deeply hope that employers, within the possible range of their operations, can automatically improve the treatment of workers, such as increasing rice subsidies, so that they can work with peace of mind and overcome difficulties. The settlement authorities, because there are many anniversaries in May, have increased police force and taken planned precautions. The police authorities of the two settlements have also established close contact, so there is no concern about security.

### Dispersal of Refugees Has Begun, First Batch of 2,000, Refugee Camps Can Be Closed in a Month

At its peak, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association accommodated over 400,000 refugees and established over 100 refugee camps. Due to continuous dispersal, there are now 15 directly affiliated refugee camps, accommodating over 9,000 refugees. The association's monthly administrative expenses are 9,000 yuan. Last month, due to financial constraints, it actively carried out dispersal. It is now learned that the first batch of dispersal work was completed yesterday morning. A total of over 2,000 refugees voluntarily registered to request dispersal. The second batch of dispersal work is scheduled to begin today.

Refugees in Suburbs Still Request Accommodation

However, there are still thousands of refugees who have repeatedly submitted letters to the association requesting continued accommodation. The letters state that they are from the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs, their homes have been destroyed, and the local areas have not yet been pacified, making it impossible to maintain a livelihood by returning home. Therefore, they request continued accommodation and apply not to be merged into other refugee camps, because the camps provide two meals of rice and free water and electricity, while self-sufficient refugee camps require payment for white rice. Therefore, the young and strong go out to work as peddlers and coolies, using their income to supplement their expenses. If they are moved to other camps, they will not be able to continue their occupations, making their lives even more difficult.

Only Difficulty, No Housing

Most of the housing in the association's refugee camps belongs to temples, monasteries, or local public property, such as the Railway Hospital on Bazilu, the Tianhou Palace on North Henan Road, the Yu Family Villa in Fahuadongzhen, and the 15th Refugee Camp on Haig Road, which are provided by homeowners who voluntarily allow refugees to live there. A refugee once stated that they can work as small laborers and peddlers, and women can also work in factories to maintain a livelihood. However, the most difficult thing after leaving the camp is having no housing. The places where we are currently sheltered are public property, so it is very necessary for enthusiastic charitable people to negotiate and continue to provide housing so that we do not have to wander the streets and live in the open.

Postponed for One Month, Then Closed

The person in charge of the association said to a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency yesterday that the organizers of the association originally planned to close at the end of this month due to financial difficulties, but because various tasks cannot be carried out as scheduled, it will be postponed to the end of next month. As for the affiliated First and Eleventh Refugee Camps, which were originally scheduled to close at the end of this month, but because it is difficult for refugees to find housing outside, it will be extended for a few days.

### F. Maze Returns to Shanghai Soon, This Trip Is to Inspect Customs Affairs

F. Maze, Director-General of Customs of the Ministry of Finance, has been in Hong Kong for some time. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, Maze will return to Shanghai from Hong Kong in the shortest possible time. His duties at the Shanghai office of the Inspectorate General of Customs on Hede Road are currently being performed by Mr. G. Gamber, a British customs official from the General Affairs Section of the office. The Director-General of Customs usually inspects customs offices across the country in the spring and autumn, but since the outbreak of the war, Maze has not inspected North China due to the increasingly unstable situation. He visited South China last autumn, so his trip to Hong Kong this time is a routine inspection, and there are no other special circumstances.

### Bodyguard of British Director of the Public Works Department Murdered in Western Shanghai, Two Bullets Hit Vital Points and Resulted in Death, Perpetrator Escaped and the Police Are Intensively Searching

At 9:20 AM yesterday morning, a shooting occurred near the Hollywood gambling den on Yu Yuan Road, a "bad land" in western Shanghai. The victim was a British bodyguard named Carine, who was shot twice on the spot and died. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the details are as follows:

Protecting the British Director

The British man, W.B. Carine, 50 years old, was a constable in the Shanghai Municipal Police. He was recently assigned to protect the personal safety of Mr. Haile, a British expatriate and manager of the Nei Dou Yang Jian Company, the new director of the current Public Works Department, at his residence at No. 15 Kaison Villa, Emei Yue Road, Yu Yuan Road. Since being assigned, Carine has been diligent in his service and fulfilled his duties.

Suddenly Shot

The Bu Nei Men Yang Jian Company is located at No. 133 Sichuan Road. Haile goes to the company every day to work, and Carine protects him. Yesterday was Sunday, Haile rested as usual, so Carine also had a day off. At 9:20 AM yesterday morning, Carine was walking in civilian clothes in the Emei Yue Road area when two thugs suddenly jumped out from the side of the road on the bridge over the small river. They immediately drew their pistols and fired four shots at Carine. Carine was caught off guard and was hit twice, once in the chest and once in the waist. He immediately collapsed to the ground, blood gushing out, and his breath was faint. He was seriously injured. The two thugs, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled into a nearby alley and disappeared without a trace.

Seriously Wounded and Died

After the shooting occurred, the Jing'an Temple Police Department was informed and immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene to investigate. They found bullet casings near the bridge on Emei Yue Road, took them back to the police station for research, and summoned an ambulance to take Carine to Hong En Hospital for treatment. However, because the injuries were to vital points, he died before he could be treated.

Police Hunt for the Perpetrator

The police authorities are currently investigating the reason for Carine's murder and are conducting an intensive search for the perpetrator to bring him to justice. Carine was usually careful and conscientious in his service and was well-known for his hard work. The police authorities and Mr. Haile deeply mourned his unfortunate death.

### Villagers in Qingpu County Massacred, Population Loss of Over a Thousand, Disaster-Stricken Refugees Beg for Relief

It is reported that yesterday (the 27th), over 1,000 Japanese soldiers from Qingpu Zhudi, Panlong, Jiwangmiao, and Guanyintang towns arrived and were stationed in these areas. During the day, they gathered in the Qingpu-Shanghai Road area and resumed their burning and killing. Farmers who could not escape were killed, their blood flowed into the river, turning the water red. Many young women were captured and humiliated. On the same evening, the Japanese soldiers in Guanyintang set fire to the town, and most of the captured residents were burned to death. It is said that someone tried to stop them but was ignored. In one day, the number of innocent people killed reached four to five hundred, a scene of unprecedented cruelty. Guanyintang and Datieqiao are rice-producing areas in western Shanghai. It is early summer, the time for planting in the fields. This disturbance not only makes it impossible to plant in time, but also most of the farmers have been killed, and there will be a shortage of people to plant, which will have a great impact on the food supply in the nearby area. Today (the 28th), more Japanese soldiers continue to arrive in Zhudi, Jiwangmiao, and Panlong towns. The puppet troops are dealing with them, and there have been no incidents yet.

Japanese Army Search

The Japanese army is conducting a major search, harassing over 40 villages south of the road, such as Chentaixing, Zhu Jiahui, Louxia, Dujiahang, Pi Ku Laozhai, Yao Cunbang, Xixin Port, Liutu, Ershiba Tu, Datieqiao, Dujiahang, Wangjia Shiqiao, Caojiawan, etc. The captured farmers are tied up and taken to Tianshan, Mashan, Yushan, Fenghuangshan, Sijing, etc., numbering five to six hundred. Three to four hundred have already been slaughtered. The detained civilians are not given food, and they are subjected to cruel torture to force them to reveal the whereabouts of the Chinese army. If they fail to comply, they are immediately killed. The residents of each village are living in terror every day, not knowing if they will be alive the next day.

Terror Zone

Therefore, over 70 rural villages south of Qingpu-Shanghai Road, east of Qingsong Road, and north of Sijing have been evacuated. Although there have been no major battles, there are frequent encounters between the outposts of both sides. The terror situation is increasing. The corpses of people and animals emit a foul odor, which is truly appalling. It is said that enthusiastic people in Shanghai are now running around and appealing, raising funds from all walks of life for relief. It is hoped that philanthropists and fellow villagers from all walks of life will actively donate to quickly raise relief funds for this unprecedented war disaster. Here is the appeal for relief from the disaster-stricken people:

Appeal for Relief from Disaster-Stricken People

"Since the withdrawal of the national army to the west, the local areas have fallen. We refugees have endured hardship and suffering to the extreme. We were hoping to endure hardship and maintain a meager existence, but unexpectedly, the disaster of war struck again, and the city was devastated. Currently, there are over 70 disaster-stricken villages, with thousands of people dead, injured, and missing, and over 800 houses destroyed. We refugees have suffered this calamity and have no home to return to. We are scattered in neighboring areas or have traveled to Shanghai. Moreover, we cannot plant during this spring plowing season. Our homes have been destroyed, and the dead are gone, but what about the living? Therefore, we are appealing to enthusiastic people and fellow villagers from all walks of life, pleading for relief. Alas, sharing clothes and food is a common human sympathy, and good deeds will bring blessings, and Heaven is not far away. This is the appeal. Donations can be paid to the Xinhua Bank."

Panlong Escaped

According to a fellow villager from Sijing Town, Songjiang County, who came to Shanghai and spoke to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the Japanese army's massacre and burning tragedy has spread to the villages of Liu Tu Yangzhai, Shitu Pengzhai, Heshangjing, Waipojing, Datieqiao, Hejiabang, etc., three to five miles north of Sijing Town. Because after the battle on Qingpu-Shanghai Road, a captain of the Japanese Gendarmerie went out on patrol in civilian clothes and was killed by the Chinese guerrillas in Liu Tu Yangzhai, and his body was abandoned in the river. After the officer went missing, the Japanese army searched everywhere without success. Several days later, the body was found in the river near Liu Tu Yangzhai. The Japanese army then pointed out that the area was the lair of Chinese guerrillas and that the Chinese army after the fierce battle on Qingpu-Shanghai Road might be hiding there. Therefore, they launched a major offensive, indiscriminate in their attacks, burning houses and killing people. The houses in more than a dozen surrounding villages have now been reduced to ashes, and countless women, children, and the elderly have been tragically killed. Only Panlong Town has survived.

### Although the Additional Tax Case Was Passed, It Is Still Hoped That the Implementation Can Be Postponed, Chinese Taxpayers Association Requests the Board to Consider, To Be Implemented When Prices Return to Normal

The Shanghai Municipal Council's decision to increase taxes by 50% from July 1st of this year will inevitably stimulate continued price increases, cause rental disputes, and increase the market crisis. The public believes that this move by the Municipal Council completely contradicts the policy of suppressing prices and will greatly reduce or even nullify the effectiveness of suppressing prices. Although the case has been passed by the foreign taxpayers' annual meeting and is a foregone conclusion, most Chinese taxpayers still hope that the Municipal Council will consider the difficult times and temporarily postpone the implementation, and implement it after prices return to normal and the people's livelihood improves slightly, so that both the difficulties of the people and the case can be taken into account. It is heard that most taxpayers intend to ask the Chinese Taxpayers Association to forward their wishes to the Municipal Council for consideration.

### Zu Attacked Sige, Cai Wenlong Acquitted

Huang Bugao, the Sige guard of the Shanghai New Hotel on Jiujiang Road, angered several tourists on March 18 due to a minor matter. On the 29th, at about 10 PM, three thugs came to find trouble, opened fire, and injured Huang in the arm and waist. They fled separately. The detective of the Huisi Police Department obtained information and arrested a suspect named Cai Wenlong from Haimen, and sent him to the First Special District Court. He firmly denied the charges. Yesterday, Judge Huang presided over the trial and acquitted Cai Wenlong. He was remanded in custody during the appeal period.

### Engineer Commits Suicide by Poisoning

Wang Xiaoyuan, a native of Shaoxing, 26 years old, was an engineer at the Hefeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 3, Lane 455, Kangti Road. Recently, he often went to western Shanghai to gamble, resulting in huge losses and mounting debts, which he could not repay. He became despondent and bought a bottle of poison outside on the 25th and returned to the factory. At 6 PM in the evening, he swallowed the whole bottle and lay on the bed waiting to die. His colleague and fellow villager Wang Yan (24 years old) discovered it and told the accounting office. He was rushed to Baolong Hospital, but because he had been poisoned too deeply, the treatment was ineffective. He died at 8 PM on the 27th.

### New World Company Opened Dongchanghui Yesterday, Resolved to Distribute Dividend for the 28th Year

The New World Company on Nanjing Road in Shanghai held its 15th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in the West Restaurant on the 7th floor of the company at 9 AM yesterday. The shareholders who attended the meeting were very enthusiastic. First, Chairman Jin Zongcheng reported on the number of shares and the number of attendees, which was sufficient for the quorum, and gave an opening speech, saying that the company's business had reached a point of suffering coming to an end. The successive establishment of the Green Gem Theater, the New World Hotel, the New World Theater, and the Glass Radio Station this year were all created from hardship and difficulty. The business progress and reputation are increasing day by day. If it were not for General Manager Li's firm belief and effective management, and the sincere cooperation of all colleagues, it would not have been possible to achieve this. The profit last year was quite considerable, but the board of directors, in order to consolidate the company's foundation, intends to allocate more for amortization and depreciation and pay off preferred stock dividends. Only a slight distribution can be made on ordinary stock dividends. I hope that all shareholders will understand. However, our company is one of the domestic enterprises, and it cannot be fully developed by the power of a few people. I hope that all shareholders will not hesitate to give advice at any time, and the future development will be limitless. Then, General Manager Li Zejun reported on the business overview of the 28th year, saying that the business improved last spring, so he immediately engaged in the replenishment of goods and the creation of the New World Hotel, the Glass Radio Station, and the New World Theater. Due to the impact of the sharp contraction of foreign exchange, the bank's restrictions on loans, and excessive foreign exchange arbitrage, it was difficult to cope with. Fortunately, all the directors and colleagues were able to cooperate, and the business has made great progress. Statistics show that the annual profit is better than in previous years. In the future, the expansion of the business area will be carried out to seek further development. Then, the amendment to the articles of association was discussed. As a result, the draft submitted by the board of directors was passed. Immediately afterwards, the 15th board of directors and supervisors were elected. All shareholders believed that the original directors and supervisors were capable and efficient. As a result of the voting, all the original members were re-elected.

### Lawsuit Over Rent Increase in Nanyang Li, Seymour Road, Plaintiff's Claim Rejected

The houses in the Nanyang Li area of Seymour Road in Shanghai are the property of the New Sassoon Company. In August last year, all tenants were notified that the rent would be increased by 40% of the original amount. After mediation by the court failed, they filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, demanding a 40% rent increase on the grounds of increased property prices and huge expenses. The tenants elected representatives and jointly hired lawyers Zhu Wende, Zhang Guangzong, and Mao Jiaju to defend them according to law. On the 22nd of this month, Judge Gui Yu held a hearing. After the debate in court was over, the judgment was scheduled for the 27th of this month. It is now learned that the case has been judged by Judge Gui. The main text: the plaintiff's claim and the application for provisional execution are rejected, and the litigation costs are borne by the plaintiff.

### Impersonating Police Officers to Extort the Poor, Residents Request Protection

Behind Guifu Lane, Binlang Road, Tokyo Road, Donglipur Road, north of Yonghua Paint Factory, and west of Dajin Wire Factory in western Shanghai, there are five or sixty thatched sheds that have been there for many years. Since they were destroyed by fire last year, the residents have rebuilt tin-skinned bungalows on the land. The residents are mostly coolies or small business operators, struggling to survive after the disaster and living in peace. Unexpectedly, a certain Qi, impersonating a police officer, recently led many accomplices to the area and extorted money from house to house, calling it an inspection fee. It is now heard that the residents plan to have Dai Kegui and others submit a request to the Municipal Council for protection.

### South City: An Unbearable Memory

— Li

Before the war, South City had dense residences and a fairly prosperous market. After the Nationalist army retreated westward, except for a portion of the northern district, which Father Jacquinot organized into a refugee zone as a safe haven, preserving the integrity of its houses and belongings, the rest of the residents fled, their belongings looted, and dilapidated houses and ruins were everywhere. Looking at the present compared to the past, one cannot help but feel a sense of profound vicissitude. I will now record what the reporter has seen and heard:

Ruinous Houses and Crumbling Walls – A Scene of Desolation

After the Japanese army occupied South City, local figures of some standing all fled. Local ruffians and hooligans seized the opportunity to rise up and colluded with the Japanese army, setting fires everywhere that lasted for two weeks, the flames refusing to die out. Therefore, apart from the refugee zone, the only areas that remained somewhat intact were the Peace Road, Zhaojia Road, Zhonghua Road, Xiaonanmen, and Dananmen areas near Laoximen. As for the areas starting from the Bund of the Sixteenth Ward, along Dongmen Road, Fangbang Road, the southern section of Zhonghua Road, Dongjie Sipailou, Guangqi Road, Sanpailou, Dadongmen, Zhaojia Road, Laoma Road, Xian Gua Street inside and outside, Chezhan Road outside Xiaoximen, Lujiabang, Zhizaoju Road, Xietu Road, Huining Road, and the Gaochang Temple area, they were all turned into scorched earth, with ruined houses and crumbling walls still visible today, presenting a desolate scene that one cannot bear to look at. Furthermore, the Haichao Temple at Dananmen, the original site of the Tushu Gongsi (Book Company) in Xinlu Village, the Fuan Company at Xiaodongmen, the Puyi Xi Yi Suo (Vocational Training Center) near the railway station, the Laishi Market on Penglai Road, the Wenmiao Park Library, the Minzhong Jiaoyu Guan (Public Education Center), Yeshi Garden, and the zoo were also destroyed in this cruel artillery fire. The local courthouse on Chezhan Road, which had stood alone amidst the scorched earth, was occupied by the Ogawa unit of the Japanese army. After their retreat, it caught fire for unknown reasons and was also burned down. Only one building in front of the gate remains, seemingly unworthy of providing shelter.

Rails and Utility Poles – Mostly Looted

After the Japanese army invaded South City, the South Railway Station was used as a military depot. All railway tracks, sleepers, and traffic signal equipment from the South Railway Station to Longhua were dismantled by the Japanese army. Except for the refugee zone and the area around Minguo Road, the utility poles along the city walls were nowhere to be seen. Even the copper wires laid on the tram tracks only remained from Xiaodongmen to Fangbang Bridge. All traffic, of course, was cut off for trains. Trams and buses disappeared from the city, marking the end of an era with the fall of the city. Recently, after South City was opened, the so-called "Huazhong Automobile Company" was established, with eight buses divided into two lines: one circling Minguo Road and the other from Laoximen along Xietu Road to Rihui Port. However, due to the sparse population, the number of passengers was very limited. As for rickshaws, there were only a few dozen at the beginning of the occupation, but they gradually increased to over 1,100. The motors of the original trams were all dismantled by the Japanese, leaving only broken-down car bodies in the factory.

Occupied Water and Electricity – Insufficient to Cover Expenses

The engine components of the China Merchants Electric Power Company were all occupied by a "Huazhong Water and Electric Linshi Association." After repairs, they continued to generate electricity in the same location, while their business department occupied the old site of the Shanghai Bank in Laoximen. The water supply also continued to be sourced from the inland water plant on Bansongyuan Road, with a "Water Management Office" set up in the old site of the Xinhua Bank on Peace Road. It is said that the monthly income from both utilities is about 60,000 yuan, a meager amount that is not enough to cover expenses, indicating the desolate state of residents and the decline of the market, resulting in a lack of usage despite the availability of supply.

Self-Proclaimed Bureaus – A Colorful Spectacle

After the Japanese army invaded South City, all formal government offices under the Nationalist government were relocated. Now, there are organizations daringly calling themselves "District Public Office," with Shen Shijing as "District Head," located in Shangwen Primary School. There is a "Court," with Yan Lunkuai as "President," located in Xicheng Primary School on Penglai Road. There is a "South City Police Branch," with Wang Zhizhang as "Chief," located in the County Chamber of Commerce in Xiaonanmen on Zhonghua Road. There is a "Yimiao Police Branch," with Zhu Jialin as "Chief," located in the Qingyun Silver Shop on Fangbang Road in Xiaodongmen. There is a "Xieqiao Police Branch," with Jin Dianyang as "Chief," located in a Western-style house at the intersection of Zhizaoju Road and Liyuan Road. There is a "Detective Team," with Zhao Yongsheng as "Team Leader," each located near the "Police Station." There is also a "National Salvation Army Headquarters," with Chen Fan as "Commander-in-Chief" and Lei Weimin as "Deputy Commander," located in the Hemingli neighborhood on the western end of Zhonghua Road. There is a "Youth Corps Security Team Headquarters," located in Shangwen Primary School. Other so-called "Public Utility Bureau Vehicle Donation Office" and "Finance Bureau Donation Office" are all located in the Minli Girls' Middle School on Wenmiao Road. It is truly a colorful spectacle, with nothing too strange to be seen.

Few Japanese Soldiers – Pseudo-Police Serving as Substitutes

To cope with mobile warfare in various locations, the entire South City is rarely seen with Japanese soldiers. Even the few present are stationed in the Rihui Port, Fenglin Bridge, and Longhua areas outside the city, with only a Kempeitai headquarters set up in the former Shanghai Municipal Police Department on Penglai Road. "Kempeitai Outposts" are also established at five locations: Minguo Road, Xinkaihe (formerly the Wireless Telegraph Bureau), Luxiangyuan Road intersection, Nanyang Bridge, and Xieqiao. In addition, a so-called "Kenzo Team" is also set up, whose members are selected from the pseudo-police to assist the Kempeitai in their duties.

Tigers and Wolves in Power – Thorns Everywhere

The so-called "military police" are only ostensibly so. During the day, they put on a show to deceive people, but they disappear at night, nowhere to be seen. They neither stand guard nor patrol. As a result, petty criminals thrive, and theft is rampant. It is even heard that the police, under the guise of searching, openly break into people's homes, overturning boxes and cabinets to search for belongings, leaving the entire public order completely unprotected. Although South City is open, allowing people to live there, hoping that the evacuating citizens would return home, it has only become a dream. Many property owners have posted notices, ordering tenants to pay rent, but the tenants, due to the lack of recovery in the market, are unable to pay and are taking a wait-and-see attitude.

Willingly Abandoning Education – Seeking Other Professions

The post office was once suspended but resumed operations in March of last year at two locations, Huajin Road and Laoximen, but only for delivering mail, not for remittances. As for education, there is only one middle school, the so-called "Special Municipality Municipal Second Middle School," located in Shangwen Primary School, and five primary schools, all borrowing the old sites of Yangzheng, Cangji, Meixi, Zijin, and Zhuyu Ye. With such a large area having only two post offices, one middle school, and five primary schools, residents find it inconvenient. However, because education has become a tool for enslavement, many young people are willingly abandoning their education, wasting their precious time to find other professions, showing that the spirited youth are not entirely without ambition even in this situation.

### The Adventures of Pinocchio (Translated)

The feature-length cartoon "The Adventures of Pinocchio," currently showing at the Nanjing Grand Theater and the Shanghai Grand Theater, is a famous Italian fairy tale that has long been popular around the world, translated into several languages. The Chinese translation was done long ago by Mr. Xu Diaofu and published by Kaiming Bookstore. It has been sold for more than ten years, and almost all progressive elementary schools use it as extracurricular reading material. It is heard that the original translator has revised it again, seeking to make the language more suitable for elementary school students, and reprinted it in a new No. 4 font, making it very beautiful. The book contains over a hundred illustrations, which are also masterpieces by famous Italian painters, no less than the cartoon. Whether you have seen the film or not, you should read this book.

### Ling Changyan Executes Legal Affairs

The famous lawyer Ling Changyan, through the persuasion of famous figures such as Yu Zhiqing, Xu Jilu, Huang Hanzhi, Wen Lanting, and Guan Jiongzhi, executes legal affairs. The office is located at 22, Lane 215, Maite Hesite Road, telephone number 33278.

### An Overview of the Self-Help Handicraft Work Undertaken by Christians in South City

The self-help handicraft work undertaken by Christians in South City has been in operation for about two years. Although not many people know about it, their work is of great significance to refugees. The central task of this self-help movement is called "Charitable Handicraft," using work-relief to replace "idle consumption." That is, using everyone's skills to transform simple consumption into circular production, with a spirit of self-help, helping others, and mutual cooperation, seeking a way of life through self-reliance.

The promotion of a movement, no matter how perfect the principles, how thorough the system, or how hard the people in charge work, it is difficult to achieve anything without the support of all parties and constant maintenance. The fact that the Christian self-help movement has achieved a preliminary foundation in South City today is not only due to the great power of this work-relief movement, but also due to the support of a group of enthusiastic people in society.

According to the report from Secretary-General Peng, in the past three months, since the opening of South City, more and more people have returned to their former residences, and coarse handicrafts and small businesses have begun to recover. The difficult problem to solve is that poverty continues to be extremely widespread, and the meager wages that self-help handicrafts can provide to workers, the number of people in need is calculated in the thousands, truly a case of too many people and not enough food.

There are enthusiastic people in this area and abroad who sponsor self-help relief, but there are not many organizations, and it is urgent to promote it. For example, a total of 400 "charity bags" have been sent out, but the actual number of clothes and odd items received each month is only about one hundred. These quantities are insufficient in any case, if we want to increase both the production and sales of handicrafts.

The scope of donations from various parties to the group is still wide, including various manufacturing raw materials, medicines, clothing, and food. In the three months since the beginning of this year, the value of various items converted into cash is 5,119.50 yuan in Chinese currency. This includes cotton yarn, steamed buns, medicines, cod liver oil, clothing, coal, etc. Some factories give them preferential treatment when they purchase raw materials.

In the spring of this year, Chinese individuals and organizations donated a total of 991.37 yuan; 30 Westerners donated 691.85 yuan; and enthusiastic people from abroad sent 3,461.62 yuan. The monthly income from the sale of the group's workshop products and horticultural products is about 1,173.00 yuan. The total monthly income, including church funds, is about 5,000 yuan, and the expenditure is about 4,800 yuan.

Various works are sometimes suspended or prospered according to the supply of raw materials and seasonal conditions. Recently, they hired Mr. Lian Yousan as an employee, preparing to expand various works, such as machine-made socks. They already have the upper part of the knitting machine, but they hope that the workers can buy the machine themselves.

Spiritual cultivation is also a kind of contribution they give to the workers. Almost all employees participate in morning and evening prayers. On Sundays, Mr. Zhang preaches, and a total of 21 workers have been baptized by Pastor Tang. The staff in charge of Sunday school are particularly enthusiastic about evangelizing to children.

In addition to the above-mentioned work-relief, they also provide relief to the sick and the very poor, providing food, clothing, medicine or cash, totaling 744 pieces of clothing, 1,807 pounds of rice, and 94.90 yuan in cash. Special attention is paid to workers who are sick or giving birth.

A total of 4,000 people received free medical treatment in this quarter. The most common diseases among children are eye diseases, skin diseases, and lice infestation. In addition, bathing facilities are often provided for children and infants.

About 220 workers' children are educated there. They get free lunch, and thanks to the teachers' attention, the children's health and discipline have improved significantly. They also run a nursery, which has resulted in increased work performance for female workers and healthier children.

The purpose of "self-help relief" is to enable a group of men and women who can still support themselves to acquire considerable skills and manufacturing raw materials, and gradually enable them to make a living. Therefore, this independent handicraft group, on the one hand, invites people with specialized skills to teach work, so that refugees can develop production capabilities; on the other hand, it pays wages to those who can work, so that they can make a living.

They often use one or two meals a day as wages for workers. From the beginning of January to the end of March, a total of 24,123 meals were provided to workers and child laborers. The average value of each meal is 20 cents. Fortunately, they have their own garden, and the supply of vegetables was very sufficient in February and March. During these three months, 3,636 bowls of tofu paste were sold, charging one cent per bowl.

The average number of workers employed during this period was 250, including 40 men, 2 teachers, various assistants, and 10 hawkers—receiving skilled workers' wages, several cooks, and unskilled workers. Most of the female workers are unskilled, and can get a monthly salary of 10.5 yuan, including meals. There are a total of 174 such female workers. 46 skilled workers receive 15.6 yuan per month, and 3 people receive 19.2 yuan, and 2 people receive 21.2 yuan. But in fact, the benefits that workers get are more than that, because most of them can get free medical treatment, free education, if they are ten clothes, and provide workers' children with food. The daily working time is only five and a half hours. The number of working days in spring is 16.846 days, and workers are paid wages for sick or childbirth leave.

The employment of self-help handicrafts is roughly as follows: teaching, foremen in the factory, clerks, medical assistants, cooking, boiling water and fetching water, childcare, washing, ironing, dyeing, weaving, spinning, cotton batting, sorting cloth pieces, tying mops, weaving felt, sewing, sewing shoe soles, making cloth shoes, repairing leather shoes, making straw sandals, woodworking, painting utensils and toys, and other miscellaneous work such as mounting paintings, nailing books, making noodles, grinding grain, peddling, knitting socks and gardening, etc.

Education News

### Director of Sichuan Education Department, Guo Youshou, Publishes Report on Inspection of Various Counties; Funding Increased by One Time Compared to Last Year; Teaching and Management Generally Satisfactory

(Chengdu Aviation News) Guo Youshou, Director of the Education Department, went to Shuangliu, Pengshan, Meishan, Jiajiang, Emei, Leshan and other counties on April 14 to inspect education, and returned to Chengdu on the evening of the 17th. According to Guo, the situation and feelings of this inspection are as follows: (1) The education funds budget of each county this year has increased by one time compared with last year. (2) The "special account management" of education funds in each county has not been fully implemented, and the audit committees of education funds have not been established. (3) The procedures for issuing education funds still require teachers to go to the county seat to collect funds, which interferes with the curriculum. (4) The teaching and management of primary school education are generally suitable, but a few private schools do not pay much attention to labor, physical education, music and other subjects, and even have schools that do not include physical education courses. As for the curriculum schedule, there is still a class hour system. (5) The spirit of the principals and teachers of secondary schools is generally good, but the funding of county middle schools has not followed the new standards for payment of county middle school funds issued by the province due to the difficulty in raising funds. The internal affairs of students are generally poor except for one or two schools, which urgently need to be improved in the future. (6) The equipment of primary and secondary schools is very simple, and some are completely without it. (7) Each county now has considerable plans for the implementation of universal national schools. In about one year, each bao can set up a national school. They will be implemented in the second half of this year or the first half of next year. Central schools will be fully established after July this year. According to the fund-raising methods stipulated by the central government, the provincial government will urge the completion of national education within three years. (8) The organization and division of townships in each county are generally planned, but the number of school-age children, out-of-school children, and out-of-school people is not very accurate. After instructions, they are starting to plan an investigation. (9) The treatment of primary school teachers has now been increased compared with last year. After the implementation of the new school system, it can be increased to 18 yuan and even more than 35 yuan. (10) The county heads and middle-level education personnel in each county are still working hard for education, but there are also cases where the spirit is slightly lax. (11) The equipment of the public education centers in each county is very poor, and most of them passively display books and lack active public guidance. Regarding the aspects that should be improved in the above points, Guo has given separate instructions. Every time he arrives at a place, he also informs the county heads and education officials to pay special attention to raising education funds, training teachers, and earnestly investigating the number of out-of-school children and out-of-school people when implementing the new county system, and to create a distribution chart of central schools and national schools.

### Sichuan Provincial Government Issues Order to All Schools to Add Military Service Courses, Specifies Several Reference Materials

(Chengdu Aviation News) The Ministry of Military Affairs stipulates that military service is a sacred obligation that citizens should fulfill. Schools should add military service courses. The provincial government has issued an order to follow, and specified several reference materials. The original order is as follows: 1. The Education Department submitted a case stating that the Ministry of Education's telegram dated October 12, 1939, approved the Ministry of Military Affairs' consultation, stating that serving in military service is a sacred obligation that citizens should fulfill. Schools should add military service courses for students. Please instruct the Education Departments to obtain materials from the command headquarters in their respective jurisdictions to compile and distribute lectures, etc. In addition to sending telegrams, they should obtain materials on military service from the command headquarters of the military control area in each province, and compile and supplement teaching materials to distribute to schools at all levels, and teach them in civics courses. The department should also obtain nine types of materials related to military service from the conscription office of the military control area, except for two types of Sichuan Military Service Overview and Compilation of Military Service Laws and Regulations, which are sold in bookstores and should be purchased by schools themselves. The remaining seven types, including the Provisional Regulations on the Organization of Army Officers' Conferences in Rural Areas, the Provisional Regulations on the Management of Army Soldiers in Rural Areas, the Revised Provisional Regulations on Military Service Law, the Sichuan Province's Second Lottery Implementation Method for Public Conscription in Extraordinary Times, the Sichuan Province's Interim Measures for Handling Desertion, the Sichuan Province's Implementation Details for Preferential Treatment of Families of Soldiers Fighting Against Japan, and the Sichuan Province's Interim Measures for Conscription Money in Extraordinary Times, have now been printed.

### Children's Day Preparatory Committee Prints and Distributes Report on Committee Affairs

The Shanghai Ninth Children's Day Preparatory Committee held a closing meeting a few days ago and printed and distributed a report on the committee's work. Regarding the establishment of a children's library, the committee originally planned to order 100,000 children's welfare badges, but due to time constraints and the spring break of the schools, only 40,000 children's welfare badges were ordered. As of April 27, the committee had received 2,847 yuan, one dime and eight cents in donations for the children's library. In addition, the committee hopes to reach the number of 4,000 yuan soon, including donations from all parties. All temporary receipts will be issued each time a donation is received. As for formal receipts, they must be signed and sealed by the executive chairmen Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, and Wu Weide before they can be issued one after another. All the donations raised by the Children's Day Preparatory Committee will be transferred to the Children's Library Preparatory Committee. The former hopes that the latter will launch a large-scale fundraising plan for a longer period of time, and strive to fully realize the ideal of establishing a children's library before December 31, 1940. In addition, the closing meeting of the Children's Day Preparatory Committee authorized the Director-General Chen Zhengfan to continue handling the acceptance of donations, and must complete the liquidation before May 30. After Huang Jingwan audits the accounts, all donations will be transferred to the Children's Library Preparatory Committee.

### Overview of Adult Education Implementation in Guizhou Province (4)

(3) Remuneration: Full-time teachers are the principle for adult education classes. Each teacher must teach two classes per day. In addition to the guidance director of the central foundation school receiving their original salary, the other transferred teachers will receive at least ten yuan per month for living expenses, and an additional five yuan for each class completed. Teachers in adult education classes organized by secondary schools and cultural and industrial organizations will not receive subsidies. During their service period, adult education teachers shall be exempt from labor and military service obligations.

(6) Curriculum and Teaching Materials

(1) Curriculum: There are two main implementation principles for adult education this year: First, equal emphasis should be placed on political training, literacy training, and life skills training. Second, efforts should be made to coordinate with the mobilization and training work of the people in the war zone. Based on these two principles, the curriculum for adult education classes includes five subjects: Anti-Japanese War Speeches (including memorial weeks), Mandarin Chinese, Current Affairs Reports, Anti-Japanese War Songs, and Assembly Activities. The weekly teaching time allocation is shown in the table below: Monday has three lessons in total, which are Premier's Memorial Week (25 minutes), Mandarin Chinese (50 minutes), and Mandarin Chinese (25 minutes). Monday has three lessons in total, which are Anti-Japanese War Speeches, Mandarin Chinese, and Anti-Japanese War Songs. Wednesday has three lessons in total, which are Current Affairs Reports, Mandarin Chinese, and Writing Practice. Thursday has three lessons in total, which are Anti-Japanese War Speeches, Mandarin Chinese, and Anti-Japanese War Songs. Friday has three lessons in total, which are Current Affairs Reports, Mandarin Chinese, and Writing Practice. Saturday has three lessons in total, which are Anti-Japanese War Speeches, Mandarin Chinese, and Anti-Japanese War Songs. Sunday has three lessons in total, which are Mandarin Chinese exercises, Mandarin Chinese, and Assembly Activities (all the above times are the same as on Monday).

(2) Teaching Materials: The content of the teaching materials for each subject in adult education classes is based on the above principles and strives to meet the needs of wartime. Anti-Japanese War Speeches are based on the book "How the People Should Resist Japan," compiled and printed by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. A simplified version of the "Lectures on How the People Should Resist Japan" will be compiled and distributed to adult education teachers for elaboration and lectures. Mandarin Chinese uses the "People's School Textbook" compiled and printed by the Ministry of Education, with completing 60 lessons as the standard. However, from the third term of adult education classes onwards, 40 lessons will be the minimum standard. In September, because the textbook was insufficient, another one million copies of "How the People Should Resist Japan" were printed and distributed as substitutes. Current Affairs Reports are based on the information issued by the provincial government every day and various daily newspapers. The provincial government also compiled and printed methods for Current Affairs Reports and distributed them to teachers for reference. Anti-Japanese War Songs include the national anthem, the Volunteer Army March, the Conscription Song, the Training Militia Song, Defend Our Homeland, Training Strong Men, Guerrilla Song, and Fight the Japanese, totaling eight songs, later changed to nine songs. All adult education students must be able to sing them fluently. The content of assembly activities is designed and conducted by the teacher based on "Examples of Social Activities for Adult Education Classes." "Guidance Methods for Social Activities in Adult Education Classes" are also issued for teachers to use.

### Miniature Football Upset: Lido Lost to Jingxiang Yesterday; Youyou drew with East Cercle, Portuguese Merchants Defeated Zhenyou

Fourteen matches were played yesterday in the Zhen Dan Cup miniature football tournament, in both Group A and Group B. In the three Group A matches, Youyou and the British Army were evenly matched and ended in a draw. Zhenyou, due to the absence of too many key players, was unable to defeat the Portuguese merchants. In the final match, Lido was surprisingly defeated by Jingxiang.

Jingxiang Creates an Upset

In the pivotal match between Lido and Jingxiang, Jingxiang's reputation was already evident. Lido, due to fatigue from their previous match against the French Army the day before, and a lack of proper team formation, conceded the first goal in the 22nd minute when Jingxiang's right-winger Zheng Quchun kicked the ball into the corner of the goal from the crowd. Eight minutes later, center forward He Sirong scored again, giving Jingxiang a two-goal lead. Jingxiang led by two goals at halftime. After the change of ends, Lido launched a fierce attack, making Jingxiang the target. Unfortunately, Lido's luck was not good. In the 14th minute, Captain Sun created an opening, and Jiang Chao kicked the ball into the corner of the net from seven yards out, pulling one goal back. Although Jingxiang was under pressure for 35 minutes in the second half, they ultimately won 2-1, creating a major upset. Jingxiang's players were: Wu Hanxiang, Zhou Rongyi, Liu Guocai, Li William, Xiao Guanrong, He Sirong, and Zheng Yaochun.

Lido's players were: Zheng Tongyu, Yan Shixin, Jiang Chao, Cai Shengsen, Le Xiuhua, Sun Jinshun, Zhang Mingsheng, and Meng Yiliang.

Youyou Draws with East Cercle

The opening match between Youyou and East Cercle was full of excitement. After about ten minutes of stalemate, Cao Qinfang scored the first goal. At halftime, Youyou led by only one goal thanks to Cao Qinfang's valuable kick. After the change of ends, East Cercle brought on fresh troops in Lao Ling. Lao Ling advanced on the left and Pail rushed in, tying the score. The final result was a 1-1 draw. East Cercle's players were: Mauris, Harrisson, Arnault, Gelaire, Lao Ling, Macleod, Kinsellaire, and Pail.

Youyou's players were: Tao Ziming, Zhou Qilin, Chen Xiaoping, Wang Zhangbao, Wu Binghao, Cao Qinfang, and Zhao Yongfang.

Portuguese Merchants Triumphant

The Portuguese merchants led Zhenyou 3-1 at halftime. In the second half, the Portuguese merchants added two more goals, winning 5-2. The Portuguese merchants' players were: M. Surroca, C. Remiddi, J. Remiddi, Sheffer, V. Surroca, B. Remiddi, and Gain.

Zhenyou's players were: Hulfei, Yu Zhendong, Xu Rizhao, Xu Ridong, Bobov, Lü Beck, Kareku, and Yang Hongkui.

Economic Special Issue, Issue 137

### Economic Special Issue

— Gao Chongbo

The establishment of concessions in Shanghai originated from the Treaty of Nanjing after the Opium War; it has only been 97 years since then. Initially, there were separate British, American, and French concessions. Ten years before the founding of the Republic of China, the British and American concessions merged into the International Settlement. Thus, the Shanghai concessions became a collective term for the International Settlement and the French Concession. Over the years, the population has increased, and municipal administration has improved, making it one of the world's famous commercial ports, forming the distribution center of China's commerce and finance. In this extraordinary time and special environment, the finances of the concessions are naturally full of difficulties. Public bonds are used to make up for the shortfall. I would like to take a historical and numerical approach to study the overview of Shanghai's concession bonds, which I believe will be welcomed by comrades in the economic field.

(1) Total Amount Issued Before and After: The International Settlement issued silver tael bonds and national currency bonds. The total amount was 47,229,945 yuan in national currency. The French Concession issued eleven silver tael bonds and one national currency bond. The total amount was 25,740,839 yuan in national currency. The total amount of public debt for both concessions was 72,970,784 yuan.

(2) Earliest Issue and Latest Repayment: The French Concession first issued public bonds one year before the founding of the Republic of China. The International Settlement began to solicit public bonds in the 15th year of the Republic of China.

The final repayment date for the International Settlement's public bonds is 1967; the final repayment date for the French Concession's public bonds is 1964.

(3) High and Low Market Prices of Public Bonds: The highest price for the International Settlement's public bonds was 90 yuan per 100 yuan in 1926. The lowest price was 76 yuan per 100 yuan in 1937. The highest price for the French Concession's public bonds was 101.5 yuan per 100 yuan in 1911. The lowest price was 73 yuan per 100 yuan in 1934. In general, the rise and fall depend on the interest rate.

The contents of the public bonds of the two concessions over the years and the recent fundraising of 16 million yuan of public debt in the International Settlement will be described in detail below:

Public Bonds Raised by the International Settlement Public Works Bureau

(1) 6% Silver Tael Bonds from 1926, with 4,880,000 taels still outstanding. Interest is paid in June and December each year. The market price was 90 taels per 100 taels. It is scheduled to be fully repaid before 1956.

(2) 5% Silver Dollar Bonds from 1934, totaling 10,040,700 yuan. The principal was originally scheduled to be repaid between 1944 and 1964. Interest is paid in June and December each year. The market price was 77 yuan per 100 yuan.

(3) 5.5% Silver Dollar Bonds from 1936, totaling 5,000,000 yuan. The principal was originally scheduled to be repaid after 1946. Interest is paid in June and December each year. The market price was 81 yuan per 100 yuan.

(4) 5% Silver Dollar Bonds from 1937, totaling 9,000,000 yuan. The principal was originally scheduled to be repaid between 1947 and 1967. Interest is paid in June and December each year. The market price was 76 yuan per 100 yuan.

(5) 6% Public Bonds from 1940, totaling 16,000,000 yuan. Calculated in Chinese currency commonly used in Shanghai. The principal is scheduled to be repaid between 1941 and 1950. Interest is paid at the end of June and the end of December each year. The guarantee for repayment of the principal and payment of interest is the franchise fee paid by Shanghai Power Company and Shanghai Water Company after the price increase. Like other public bonds, it is guaranteed by the general assets of the Public Works Bureau. When issued, the price was 95% of the face value.

The above silver tael bonds of the International Settlement total 4,880,000 taels. According to the exchange rate of 7.15 issued by the Ministry of Finance of the National Government, the value is 6,820,052,445 yuan in national currency.

In addition, the International Settlement has four national currency bonds, totaling 40,040,700 yuan. Combined with the silver tael bonds, the total is 47,229,945 yuan.

Public Bonds Raised by the French Concession Council

### A Brief Discussion on Yarn Prices (Part 1)

— Ma Zhaorong

The yarn prices discussed here are not about the rise and fall of yarn prices, but about the high and low of prices. Why are the selling prices of brands such as Jin Cheng and Shuang Ma so high? Especially Te Jin Cheng. This is related to the quality of the yarn and the reputation of the factory.

How to judge the quality of yarn? Here are some main conditions: 1. Tensile strength (i.e., strength), 2. Evenness, 3. Color, 4. Twist. Yarn with high tensile strength, even texture, white color, and moderate twist is good quality yarn. Conversely, the quality is inferior.

What does the tensile strength of yarn mean? Tensile strength is the force required to break the yarn. Applying force within this limit will not cut it. The greater this force, the less it can support and the more likely it will break. Therefore, high tensile strength is a requirement for most buyers.

Since high tensile strength is commonly sought by buyers, manufacturers can increase it as much as possible. However, increasing tensile strength is related to the manufacturer's production cost, so the tensile strength of yarn produced by different factories varies.

Why does the tensile strength of yarn vary? This is related to raw materials, twist, machinery, and management. The raw material of yarn is cotton, and cotton fibers vary in length. Long fibers are better than short fibers, and yarn spun from them has higher tensile strength. However, because the quality is good, the price is high. High prices increase the cost of yarn, so the quality of raw materials is also limited by cost considerations. The length standard for ordinary spinning fibers is roughly as follows: 7/8 inch for 16 counts or less. 1 inch for 17-26 counts. 1 1/16 inch for 27-36 counts. 1 1/8 inch for 37-44 counts. 1 1/16 inch for 45-52 counts. 1 1/4 inch for 53-61 counts. 1 5/16 inch for 61-70 counts. 1 3/8 inch for 71-78 counts. 1 7/16 inch for 79-85 counts. 1 1/2 inch for 86-100 counts.

On the one hand, the price of raw materials should be reduced as much as possible, and on the other hand, the tensile strength should be fully increased. This difficult task requires the expertise of textile technicians. Textile technicians often adopt the characteristics of various fibers and blend several suitable raw cottons together, which can take into account costs and increase tensile strength.

As for twist, under normal circumstances, more twist can increase tensile strength. However, too much is also not suitable, as the yarn becomes wrinkled and stiff.

Speaking of machinery, it also has a great impact on tensile strength. New machines spin better than old ones. Belt-driven large drafting machines are better than ordinary machines. Because the spun yarn is more even, the tensile strength is greater.

What about management? It also has a considerable impact. If workers do not follow the work procedures and methods, or the temperature and humidity are not properly adjusted, or the drafting (elongation) of each machine is not properly distributed, the tensile strength of the spun yarn will undoubtedly be worse.

How is the tensile strength measured? The method used by yarn factories is as follows: Place one hank of yarn on a tensile strength machine. After the machine is started, wait for the yarn to break, and then read the tensile strength from the machine's indicator.

What kind of yarn is a hank? Winding the yarn 80 turns on a yarn reeling machine with a frame of one and a half yards long is called a hank. The length of one hank of yarn is 120 yards.

If you don't have a tensile strength machine, you can use a spring scale instead. Tie one end of the hank to a nail, hook the other end to the spring scale, and then pull the spring scale forcefully. At the same time, pay attention to the indicator on the scale. After a part of the yarn breaks, you can read the tensile strength of the yarn. The tensile strength of ordinary yarn varies greatly. The tensile strength of yarn supplied to the factory for weaving is very high, while the tensile strength of yarn for sale can be much lower. The approximate tensile strength in pounds for yarn for sale is as follows: 80 pounds for 10 counts. 70 pounds for 16 counts. 60 pounds for 20 counts. 50 pounds for 32 counts. 40 pounds for 40 counts.

Evenness affects the weaving of fabrics. If the yarn is even, weaving is easier, and the woven fabric is smooth and without defects. If the yarn is clean, the woven fabric is also clean. This has a great impact on the selling price of the fabric. What counts as evenness? It can be considered even when the difference in thickness of the yarn is minimal. As for cleanliness, there should be few leaf scraps and broken seeds on the yarn. How can it be even, and how can it be clean? This depends on the spinning technology.

How to test the evenness? The method used by yarn factories is to wind the yarn to be tested on a yarn board machine onto a black board. The yarn is tightly attached, and the yarn is clearly displayed on the black background. Whether the yarn is even or not can be compared at a glance.

### Market Intelligence Consultant

Mr. Ling Yaogong asked: I have three questions and respectfully request answers to clarify the facts:

(1) The market price of Japanese gold notes in Shanghai is 1.30 yuan in legal tender for one yuan. However, a telegraphic transfer from HSBC of 100 yuan in legal tender only equals about 25 yuan in Japanese currency. Why is there such a huge difference? Otherwise, directly carrying cash to Japan would definitely be profitable.

(2) The discount fee for each thousand yuan of telegraphic transfer is now more than one hundred yuan. If I plan to deposit funds in the bank for long-term fixed savings, can I first purchase the bank's telegraphic transfer notes and then deposit the telegraphic transfer notes at face value? Will the bank refuse to accept them?

(3) What is foreign exchange arbitrage?

Wang Qin answers:

(1) The former is the price of Japanese banknotes, and the latter is the exchange rate of Japanese currency. Normally, the market price of foreign currency and the exchange rate of foreign currency should not differ so greatly. However, Japan, which is experiencing severe inflation, is an exception. This is because once Japanese banknotes leave Japan, they are like being exiled and are not allowed to return. These Japanese banknotes, which are not recognized once they leave the country, will naturally depreciate drastically, which is a natural result. The exchange rate of Japanese gold displayed by HSBC is calculated based on the official Japanese rate. Because the official exchange rate of Japanese gold still maintains a level of around 23.5 yuan against the US dollar, Japanese gold appears expensive when exchanged with legal tender, which is implementing a devaluation policy. Moreover, the exchange rate quoted by HSBC is essentially a black market rate, so the exchange rate of Shanghai to Japan is much higher than the price of Japanese banknotes. Simply put: One yuan of Japanese banknotes bought with 1.30 yuan of legal tender is cheap paper that even the Japanese themselves do not want. This is because Japan refuses to import it. As for the Japanese drafts of about 25 yuan bought with 100 yuan of legal tender, they can be remitted to Japan and used for deposits, payments, or purchases of goods in Japan, which is completely different in purpose from the aforementioned Japanese banknotes.

(2) The bank can do so, but only telegraphic transfers can be withdrawn upon maturity. If legal tender is required, the telegraphic transfer discount rate on the date of withdrawal must be paid.

(3) Foreign exchange arbitrage refers to the act of investing in buying low-priced spot goods and simultaneously selling high-priced futures, and then delivering the goods after a certain period of time to obtain a surplus.

Mr. Zhang Xilin asked: Please take the time to reply to the following questions, I would be very grateful:

(1) In the commercial news price list of various currencies in your newspaper, there are the following items:

Pound Sterling 114.00 Hong Kong Dollar 3.52

Pound Draft 53.40 French Franc 0.29

US Dollar 118.50 and so on

US Draft 14.45

I don't know if the market price is 114 yuan in legal tender for one pound of British gold? And 118.50 yuan in legal tender for one US dollar? How are British and American drafts calculated? I would especially appreciate a detailed explanation of the location and procedures for buying and selling them.

(2) Are there any British one-shilling silver coins, and one-pound and half-pound gold coins, and American five-dollar and ten-dollar gold coins, and one-dollar and half-dollar silver coins for sale in Shanghai now? Where can they be bought?

(3) Where is the current foreign exchange black market (i.e., the kerb market) located? Are the trading procedures the same as those of the exchange (i.e., through brokers)? Or are they purchased directly from banks? Was there such an organization before the war?

(4) Where is the current location for cash trading in Shanghai and what are the procedures?

Wang Xiangqin answers:

(1) Yes, the above are all kerb market prices for each foreign currency converted into national currency. If you have no commercial needs, that is, if you have no legitimate purpose, please do not try it lightly. This is because this type of market has now been manipulated by speculators. If you participate in it, it is not only an illegal act, but also a risk of losing your entire fortune. At the very least, you will have to sacrifice a commission every time you enter and exit.

(2) Yes, there are. But if you have surplus funds, it is still more beneficial to deposit them in the bank.

(3) The foreign exchange market refers to an abstract area for buying and selling international drafts. This type of market originally had no specific market organization, nor a fixed gathering place. As for the name "black market," it only existed during the war, because the prices for buying and selling drafts were not calculated according to official prices, but according to kerb market prices, hence the name. The components of the Shanghai foreign exchange market include foreign banks, Chinese banks, import and export firms, foreign exchange brokers, and investors and speculators. In normal times, buying and selling are divided into spot and futures. Spot is settled on the same day, and futures are settled at the end of the month. Futures are more expensive than spot. Opening hours: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day. There is no market in the afternoon on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and no market all day on Sundays. If you want to buy, you can directly order from banks and money houses, or you can ask a broker to buy it for you. However, you must pay the prescribed commission for both buying and selling. In times of intense speculation and rapid price fluctuations, there is also a high risk of loss, so if you have no legitimate purpose, it is better not to try it lightly.

(4) Before the war, the Shanghai gold market was located in the "Shanghai Gold Exchange" on Jiujiang Road. After the "August 13th" Incident, the exchange was ordered to close. Now, what exists is a speculative kerb market, located in the ×× Bank on the fourth floor of No. 119 ×× Road. Its opening hours are the same as the foreign exchange market, but trading is limited to spot transactions, also known as "bars." The bars are 100% pure and come in two shapes: square bars and flat bars. Each bar is calculated as ten Shanghai taels of gold. The minimum trading unit is usually one bar, and settlement is on the same day. There are also those who trade futures, but it is extremely secretive. Customers can entrust speculative money houses and banks to handle buying and selling, and only need to pay a commission of 2 to 5 yuan per bar when buying and selling. Those without financial resources can also entrust speculative money houses and banks to buy and make margin loans, but in addition to paying a considerable commission, they must also pay a deposit, and when selling, they must also repay the interest on the purchase price. Therefore, the loss is very large. The margin is 500 to 1,000 yuan, and the monthly interest rate is 2% to 4%. However, the commissions, margins, and interest rates stipulated by each company are not uniform, and they are mostly determined by the relationship and creditworthiness of the client and the tightness of the money supply. Judging from this mode of operation and the rapid rise and fall of the market, even those who are good at speculation cannot avoid losses. It goes without saying for those who are not good at speculation. Especially if the method of borrowing money for buying and selling is used, the purpose of those engaged in this business is the client's margin and interest. It is common for the entire amount to be lost after the margin and interest are paid. How can those who are not good at this business and are not familiar with the inside story try it lightly?

Mr. Zhao Zhengxing asked: I have read your newspaper (Economic Supplement, Commercial News column, page 11 of the third sheet on February 19, 29th year of the Republic): "International Exchange Rates: 'British to Shanghai - Four Pence Four Three Seven Five.'" Is it the same for Hong Kong to Shanghai? According to this, how much Shanghai currency can be obtained for 1,000 Hong Kong banknotes? I would be grateful for a reply!

Wang Xiangqin answers:

The British exchange rate and the Hong Kong exchange rate are completely two different things. The former refers to the daily exchange rate of the British pound against legal tender; the latter refers to the daily exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against legal tender. On February 19, the British-Shanghai exchange rate was four pence four three seven five for one yuan of legal tender, and the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate was 26 yuan and 75 cents for 100 yuan of legal tender. If calculated according to the exchange rate on that day, if 1,000 Hong Kong dollars are remitted from Hong Kong to Shanghai, then more than 3,730 yuan of legal tender can be obtained in Shanghai.

Commercial News

### Securities: Overview of Foreign Stock Trading Last Week. The Jardine Matheson shares rose and fell sharply, with a difference of 45 yuan.

Last week, the prices of stocks in various industry guilds fluctuated suddenly, rising and falling sharply, which was a major change not seen in the past year or two. Outsiders were shocked and told each other, some rejoicing that they were not involved, and others regretting that they had not taken action. The joys and sorrows of those involved can be imagined. The rise and fall of Jardine Matheson shares were the largest and fastest. The closing price on Friday the 19th was 227 yuan. After the weekend and Sunday holidays with no market, the market opened on Monday the 22nd and suddenly rose to 272 yuan. The difference between the high and low was as much as 45 yuan per share, which was unprecedented. According to the issue amount of the stock, 239,356 shares, the increase in value was more than 10.77 million yuan. It is absolutely unreasonable to say that its assets suddenly increased by such a huge amount in 48 hours, and who can believe it? On the 22nd, the total transaction volume in one day was 28,800 shares, that is, 272 yuan. The transaction at the highest price also accounted for more than 4,600 shares. The psychology of the buyers was definitely not to hope for the exclusive benefit of interest. Generally, people believed rumors and wanted to rise to 300 yuan to achieve their final victory. This was used by large speculators. The most difficult thing to grasp about the inside story is that brokers contracted with each other, used people's hearts, and used the advantage that the industry guild never charged commissions to brokers to achieve empty buying and empty selling. On the surface, there were transactions, but in fact, there was nothing behind them. They just kept raising the price until it was quite high, and then secretly came out and transferred the high-priced goods to the general blind followers. Their skills were sold, and the harm was so great. According to the market price on the 19th (that is, the day before the highest price), it was 127 yuan, and the total transaction volume was also 10,600 shares. At such a high price on the 22nd, the bulls had already made a profit. Even if they did not sell all of them, they must have sold a large part of them. Moreover, those who had previously bought at a small price on the 19th would inevitably want to prevent them from coming out. At this extremely high and dangerous time, they still wanted to buy in. What is it if not blind speculation?

The highest price of the stock last year was 76.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 28 yuan, with an average of more than 52 yuan, which has exceeded the face value by two or three times. In the past four months of this year, it suddenly rose to nearly 200 yuan higher than the highest price last year. Calculated in this way, the company's assets have increased by 47.89 million yuan this year. No matter how the various assets of the company are valued at the market price, it is impossible to rise so much in such a short period of time. Even the interest it pays has not been seen to be particularly higher than other stocks. This level is of course what speculators pay attention to, but if you buy stocks without checking their assets, business, and three basic conditions for sales, and just follow what others say, then there is absolutely no doubt that the disaster is big or small. This is the common sense that investors and speculators should have. The same is true for other varieties.

At present, the trend of stock speculation is becoming more and more intense. Each broker, the larger ones, is no less than a large-scale foreign firm, and the smaller ones only rent one or two rooms. Each has a radio transmitter, and the industry guild reports its market prices and transaction volumes at any time. In the industry guild, except for brokers, no one is allowed to enter and visit during opening hours. Therefore, the offices of each broker are mixed with men and women, like a gambling den.

The industry guild recently stipulated that the trading rules for delivery are that within five days from Monday to Friday each week, buying and selling can be offset each other with the same product and the same amount of goods, and the difference in price is calculated to avoid the labor of collecting and delivering. After this, delivery is required. Therefore, this five-day period of hesitation opens a convenient door for speculators. In other words, it is a five-day short-term futures, and those who know the brokers slightly do not need to pay a deposit in advance.

(There is no provision for a deposit in the industry guild.) Saturday is completely closed, and Monday and Tuesday are the delivery period, but both buyers and sellers must pay the money first on Monday before they can receive the goods or money on Monday.

Now, stock trading is expanding, and the danger is also increasing. Therefore, each broker stipulates that during this war period between Britain and Germany, all British stocks in the hands of Germans are at risk of being confiscated by Britain, so the goods must be transferred immediately after receiving them. Any disputes should be resolved as soon as possible, and they will not be responsible after ten days.

"Note" The broker's obligation to the industry guild is to pay a membership fee of 800 taels of silver once a year. No commission is charged at ordinary times. Therefore, the industry guild calls the brokers members. (The value of a membership position is now 1,500 pounds of British gold.) It is not easy to buy it. (9)

### Sugar Market: Raw White Turns Flat

Yesterday, according to Dutch news, the sugar market continued to see a slight easing in raw white, with C.I.F. K.G. quoted at 8.550 Dutch guilders, down 0.0175. The association's bid improved slightly. The spot price of 24 raw white was 63.1 yuan at the warehouse and 63.2 yuan for new goods and 63 yuan for old goods at outside warehouses. Transshipment goods were 50 yuan. Taikoo granulated white was stable, with B-mark new goods at 72.6 yuan and old goods at 72.4 yuan at western warehouses. The rest followed suit. There was no change in granulated red, Dutch red, and local refined white. Local crystal ice was slightly lower by 5 cents, with No. 1 at 76.5 yuan and crystal clear ice at 78 yuan.

### Coal: Coke Arrives in Large Quantities

Although the coke business has been very quiet in recent days, the source of railcars is still continuous. A certain foreign firm recently brought in 2,000 new bundles of straw bales, and the market inventory is also very abundant. Under the urging of cargo owners to sell, it is appropriate for buyers to kill prices and for peers to cut prices, at about 200 yuan per ton, delivered at the wharf, and customers pick up their own cars.

### Seafood: Dried Shiitake Mushrooms Remain Tight

A small amount of dried shiitake mushrooms has arrived recently, and the market situation remains tight. Yesterday, the company opened more than ten pieces of Chinatown goods, with the price of unified village goods at 490 yuan and large slices at 623.6 yuan, all showing an increase compared to before.

### Medicinal Materials: Polygala tenuifolia Nears Depletion

Since the fall of the production area, the source of Polygala tenuifolia has been cut off. The remaining new goods have been gradually sold out, and the highest price has reached a new record of 170 yuan. According to a letter from the production area, this item has been controlled by a certain party, making it difficult to export.

### Old News Newly Copied 67 Years Ago (369)

(From this newspaper of the 12th year of the Tongzhi reign of the late Qing Dynasty)

Construction of Embankments

The villages and townships of Guangdong Province, which are surrounded by the sea on three sides, mostly rely on embankments to block the raging waves and secure their homes. The construction of embankments is financed by officials, or by the people themselves. The area where the waters of the East, South, and North Rivers converge is in Gulao Embankment, which is located in the important area of ​​the counties of Guangzhou and Zhaoqing. Outside the embankment is a vast expanse of water, and inside the embankment are rows of fields and houses. During the Daoguang period, it was breached twice. Thanks to the joint efforts of the gentry and elders of nearby villages, tens of thousands of dollars were spent on repairs, and the tranquility has been celebrated to this day. In recent years, the water has risen frequently, and the embankments have been damaged from time to time. The gentry and elders have witnessed the situation and are eager to prepare for a rainy day in order to be prepared. After gathering the crowd for public discussion, it is proposed to raise the low-lying embankments, thicken the thin ones, repair the tilted ones, and complete the damaged ones. This is indeed an essential task for disaster preparedness and a good plan for preventing disasters. Unexpectedly, there are two licentiates who, because they were not invited to sit at the meeting, interfered in various ways, which shocked everyone. In the past, Huang Sun of Lianzhou had great ambitions. He studied in Kuanglu and was friendly with Sang Weihan and Song Qiqiu. Every time they held hands, they discussed world affairs. The two always thought it was impossible. When they occasionally traveled together to the Five Old Peaks and rested on a stone, an old man arrived with a long whistle. The three spoke to him, and the old man looked at them for a long time and said to Weihan: "You will be prime minister in the future, but cunning will not allow you to die well." He said to Qiqiu: "You will also be prime minister, but forbearance will not allow you to die well." Only he said to Sun: "This man has Taoist spirit, and he should die well, but his talent is great and his position is obscure. He will only be engaged in one prefecture." Sun said: "Why worry about no position if you have talent? How can a subordinate official hinder Huang Sun?" The old man smiled and said: "You don't know it." Later, Weihan became prime minister of Jin, and Qiqiu became prime minister of the Southern Tang, and both were killed. Sun served in the Southern Han and was appointed as the Minister of the Left and Right of the Ministry of Personnel. When he retired, Sun spent his money to build the Gaoliang Embankment, irrigating more than 100 hectares of land, which the villagers relied on. Now people live at home and cannot benefit their villages and clans, how can they hope to benefit the people's livelihood when they are officials?

### The Clothing and Food of Laborers

— Qiulang

Time flies like running water. The International Labor Day (May 1st) is coming again. Due to environmental reasons, the labor community in this city does not intend to hold a ceremony, but will take a day off on that day to show solidarity with the world's laborers and to celebrate. Laborers, in a broad sense, refer to all those who work hard from sunrise to sunset, whether mentally or physically. However, in a narrow sense, it seems to specifically refer to ordinary working-class laborers, who make a living with their strength and skills all day long. Although there is a reputation of "Laborer is Sacred" in society, observing a portion of Chinese laborers, it is indeed very miserable! They work hard every morning, perhaps day and night, but it is still difficult to get enough to eat. This is due to the poor social system, and there is indeed a need for improvement! Let me now talk about the clothing and food of laborers.

The workers who work in factories are naturally better off than the hard laborers who work on the streets, because they have specialized skills in electricity or machinery. When they work in the factory, they wear specially made factory uniforms. These factory uniforms are made of coarse cloth, and the color is mostly dark blue, which is durable and resistant to dirt. However, working in an environment with coal ash and machine oil still inevitably leaves oil stains all over the body. But when they leave the factory after work, they change into neat clothes, like handsome young men. As for the hard laborers on the streets, such as dock porters, loaders, road workers, and rickshaw pullers; they only have a tattered, shabby short shirt and trousers, and there is no time to change into fancy clothes. Their spirit of enduring hardship is admirable.

As for the food of laborers, factory workers are also better off. They have three meals a day. In the morning, they casually eat some snacks or rice porridge and then go to the factory to work. At lunchtime, some live close enough to go home for lunch. Friends who live far away eat economy meals at nearby restaurants. There is also a group of female workers who eat packed meals in the factory. Among them, economical female workers bring some rice and vegetables with them when they enter the factory in the morning to fill their lunch. When it comes to working overtime at night, both male and female workers naturally go home for dinner. Only the hard laborers and rickshaw pullers on the streets, although they still work hard every day, do not have a fixed time to eat. Sometimes they eat early, sometimes late. If they encounter times when there is not enough money in their pockets, they randomly buy a few pancakes, fried dough sticks, or noodles to fill their stomachs. They work hard and the enjoyment they get is so meager that we should sympathize with them. We sincerely hope that those who care about society can find ways to improve their lives, so that they will not lack clothing and food, and so that we will not fail to commemorate the significance of Labor Day.

### Western Suit Protection Methods

— Xiao Qi

Recently, the number of people wearing Western suits has increased day by day, but many do not know how to store and maintain them, causing them to quickly become old and worn, losing their aesthetic appeal. Now, I will introduce the protection methods as follows:

Our daily-worn Western suits inevitably accumulate a lot of dust. Over time, this causes them to lose their original beauty. Therefore, each time after returning from outside, you must brush off the dust from the clothes with a clothes brush. Whether it's a jacket or pants, the brushing method must be consistent: first, brush from bottom to top to lift the fibers, and then brush from top to bottom to smooth the fibers and restore their original state. When brushing, use light force to avoid damaging the material, as Western suits are mostly made of woolen fabrics. Even when they are not made of woolen fabrics, this brushing method should be used; otherwise, you will not only fail to brush away the accumulated dust but also easily damage the suit. In addition, clothes that are usually stored at home and not worn should also be taken out frequently and brushed clean. If you find stains or grease spots on the clothes, you must remove them immediately. For fresh wine spills, you can wrap the stained area with a damp towel and rub it, which should remove the stain immediately. If it has been there for some time, you can rub it with a solution made from burning rice straw ash, then wipe it with water and carefully brush it off to eliminate the stain.

If the stain is from fruit juice, you can rub it with ordinary soap, then lightly wash it with water to remove it. For sweat stains on collars and cuffs, you can wipe them with volatile oil at any time to eliminate them. Pants cuffs are most easily soiled with mud. Do not wipe them when wet; wait until they are dry and then wipe them off with gauze.

Because the creases of Western suit pants must be neat, it is sometimes necessary to iron them frequently. However, excessive ironing can damage the fabric, so it is best to fold the Western suit pants neatly every night before going to bed, lay them on a flat table, and weigh them down with heavy objects. This will prevent the creases of the pants from losing their shape.

Western suit jackets can be hung up with a clothes hanger every night. For materials like serge, do not iron them directly; you must隔 put a wet towel in between, otherwise, they will be ironed into a shiny, mirrored surface. Also, for frequently changed clothes such as undershirts, you must remove all the dirt from the pockets before washing them. After washing and drying, make sure they are completely dry before putting them away, and they should be ironed before wearing. If you are casual about it, the result will be an unattractive Western suit.

### Mobile Homes

— Ni Xin

In the world, no people are better at enjoying life than Americans. The American standard of living is the highest, and yet the American lifestyle is also the most comfortable. The lives of people in American cities are the most intense, but they also have the most ways to seek enjoyment outside of work. What seems difficult to achieve, they can find ways to achieve. As the earth returns to spring, people become weary of city life. What they yearn for most is not eating well or dressing well, but rather to isolate themselves from the hustle and bustle of the city, to rush to the tranquil countryside, where they can loosen their ties, stretch, breathe in some fresh air, embrace all of nature, and revel in the embrace of spring. For urban dwellers in other countries, these things seem to be merely sweet dreams, but Americans have made these dreams a reality. Their method is to utilize the mobile homes that have recently become popular in America.

A mobile home is a dwelling made of aluminum or steel, constructed half like a house and half like a carriage, with wheels underneath. It is connected to a car with a mechanism, so that the dwelling can be driven away at will.

These mobile homes are designed and manufactured by experts to cater to the outdoor living needs of city dwellers. They occupy a very economical space. From the outside, they may seem small in volume, but the interior area is quite spacious, comparable to a bus. Inside, there is a kitchen, a bedroom, and a recreation room. Although simple, it has all the necessary equipment.

Driving a mobile home from the city to the countryside and stopping at a suitable location allows one to comfortably enjoy the pleasures of rural life. In the past, urban dwellers would also come to the countryside for picnics and camping, but in terms of convenience and comfort, that is far from comparable to today's mobile homes!

### Small Notes on Food and Nourishment: Peanuts

— Zhang Yaoren

Peanuts are leguminous plants, commonly known as "longevity fruits." They are about a foot tall, mostly creeping on the ground. The leaves are pinnate, with even leaflets. The flowers are yellow, shaped like small butterflies. After flowering, the ovary enters the ground one or two inches and forms a pod, containing one to four seeds. They are crisp and sweet, and are roasted as a leisure snack. In the early years of the Kangxi reign, Yi Yingyuan went to Japan to obtain seeds and sent them back to China, which is how this crop began to exist. Those produced in Xinghua are sweet and full, called "yellow soil"; those produced in Taiwan are astringent and small, called "white soil." This is because their soil properties are different; hence, the quality of their produce also varies greatly. It is said that their tips can produce phlegm, so they must be removed when eating them. I believe that their tips are where the crystallization occurs, so the reason for removing them is because they are difficult to digest, not because they cause phlegm. Furthermore, Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica does not include them, indicating that they were not used for medicinal purposes in ancient times. However, they can benefit the spleen, moisten the lungs, harmonize the stomach, and resolve phlegm, truly possessing nourishing power. It is a pity that physicians generally regard them as snacks and believe that they can produce phlegm and do not adopt them for medicinal purposes. I have often seen neighbors suffering from coughs with excessive phlegm, and I would take dozens of raw peanuts, remove the shells and skins, take the pure meat, mash it, and mix it with hot water to drink, and the phlegm and cough would subside on their own. In the past, the family of Tong Luan of Lu'an also used this method whenever they encountered phlegm and cough, and they said that its phlegm-resolving effect was better than that of Trichosanthes fruit and Fritillaria bulb. Common people eat them roasted with fire, which can produce phlegm, but I have tried it myself, eating eight or nine roasted peanuts and feeling that phlegm accumulates and is easier to expectorate. Therefore, the phlegm-resolving and phlegm-clearing effects depend entirely on whether they are raw or cooked, but it is best to eat them in small amounts.

Small Notes on Food and Nourishment was commissioned by my teacher, Mr. Xuyuan. This article was not revised and edited before he suddenly passed away. The bad news arrived, and my heart was deeply saddened. Therefore, I filled out a ci poem "Partridge Sky" and added it at the end, truly not knowing that my tears would fill the stationery.

The bad news suddenly came this morning,
I felt黯然 and wanted to die.
I was afraid to mention the past and put down the pen,
How could I bear to read the old articles on food nourishment?
I thought of his俊逸,
His句淸新,
I threw my heart into it and became a poet.
I made a promise in泉臺 to be reborn in another life,
I wish to結程門 and continue our unfinished business.

### Please Teachers and Parents Read This Report from the "Little Thieves Gang"

— Qing Xian

This is unfortunate news. The author discovered a "Little Thieves Gang" theft case yesterday afternoon. Now, I will briefly record the entire process below and hope that all parents and teachers will pay attention to it.

The day before yesterday afternoon, I received a report from a peddler of used goods saying that a group of children had stolen towels and other items from your store and wanted to sell them to a used goods dealer. Because he suspected that the source was illegal, he did not buy them and came specifically to inform us. After receiving this warning, the colleagues in our store took special precautions, especially paying attention to the children who often entered and exited the store, thus leading to the arrest yesterday.

First, there were about eight or nine children playing outside the store. Eventually, two of them entered the store to carry out the "work" of theft, leading to their arrest.

"Did you steal our merchandise?" I began to question him like this.

"Sir! I didn't steal!"

I firmly grabbed his small hands and pulled out the three stolen handkerchiefs from his pocket. I asked him again, "What are these? Do you admit that you stole them?"

"Sir! I won't do it again!" he pleaded.

"Okay, I can forgive you. But were you the one who stole the towels twice the day before yesterday?"

"No, no, it wasn't me." At this time, another staff member caught a so-called "lookout," who was about eleven or twelve years old, as thin as a monkey. I asked him sharply, "How old are you? What's your name?" But I asked three times, and he didn't answer. Then I said in a threatening tone, "If you don't tell me, we'll beat you to death!" I waved my hand at him.

The older one still didn't say a word. The younger one seemed frightened and slowly said, "I'm eleven years old this year, and my name is Tian ××. My senior brother (referring to the older one) is fourteen years old, his surname is Wang. We both study at the Hedde Road ×× Elementary School."

"Why did you steal?"

"One evening after school, as I walked out of the school gate, a man in a Western suit grabbed my sleeve and said with a smile, 'Good brother! How about I give you five cents?'"

"Why are you giving me money? I don't want it."

"'I'll not only give you money but also treat you to a movie and snacks.'"

"'I can't accept it.'"

"'Good brother! Are you Tian ××? Your father told me to accompany you to the movies and have snacks.'"

"'Sir! Really? Thank you, I'll go with you.'"

"'After watching the movie, when we were eating snacks, he asked me to do one thing—to steal. I said in surprise, 'My mother doesn't allow me to, and I don't want to steal other people's things. People who steal are thieves!'"

"'Was the movie good? Did the snacks taste good? Was the sugar bought with money sweet? If you don't steal, as long as you keep an eye on your senior brother Wang ×× to see if anyone is going to catch him, then you can get food, entertainment, and money every day.' The man in the Western suit said to me, then greeted two people who were already sitting at the opposite table and introduced them to me."

"'That is Captain Wu. You must listen to his commands. That is Brother Wang (a classmate), your senior brother. You watch him to see if anyone is going to catch him.'"

"After I joined their gang, I learned that there were a total of twenty-seven members, divided into three small teams, each with a captain. After school, the twenty-seven people would gather at a predetermined place, listen to the man in the Western suit assign them to steal things in various places, and be directed by the captain. At 4:30 in the evening, everyone would return to the predetermined delivery place (different every day) to hand over the goods. Depending on each person's work strength, they could receive a reward of five cents to one dime. When dismissing, the man in the Western suit would determine the next day's gathering place and delivery place after school. If you didn't have anything to hand over, you would be whipped. If you had already joined the gang (seeing the movie was considered joining the gang) and didn't go to work, or wanted to quit, you would be severely beaten."

"Therefore, although I regretted it, I couldn't escape. Today, Senior Brother Wang is the thief, and I am the 'lookout.' Captain Wu has already gone back to report to the man in the Western suit."

After listening to his words, I couldn't help but feel frightened. This is such a significant issue! The hearts of children are pure, but their willpower is weak. That man in the Western suit uses coercive and enticing, terrorizing methods to lead the young citizens of China onto the path of bandits. This crime is unforgivable. However, if teachers and parents can pay attention to the actions of their children after school, this terrible thing would not happen.

Dear parents and teachers! Quickly and strictly monitor your children!

Editor's note: This is a report written by a staff member of a store in the 百樂商塲 describing the results of personally interrogating the "Little Thieves Gang." The two children have been sent to the Jing'an Temple police station. This kind of organization, which is even more abhorrent than kidnappers, should be thoroughly investigated with the assistance of schools and parents.

### A Righteous Person Who Meddles in Others' Affairs

— Kang

At around 8:00 this morning, at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Xinzha Road, a truck ran over a young man riding a bicycle, throwing him six or seven feet. His lower body was injured. The truck driver not only did not help the injured person up but also punched him repeatedly. The truck's worker also joined in the beating, causing the injured person to suffer additional injuries. At that time, although the passersby were all indignant, none of them stood up to speak out. Fortunately, a British conductor on a public bus (number forgotten) stepped forward to speak out righteously and called the police, sending everyone to the police station for investigation. I happened to be passing by and learned about this after questioning passersby. Only then did the other passersby start to discuss it, some saying, "This conductor spoke out righteously and stood up for the victim, which is truly admirable!" Others said, "Why make enemies? It's better to mind your own business. Meddling only creates more trouble!" Still others said, "If I were the driver, I would first teach this conductor a lesson." Upon hearing this, I couldn't help but feel moved. The truck driver was at fault for injuring someone and should not have resorted to violence. He should be severely punished as a warning to others. This conductor was able to stand up for what is right, which is a model for us all. It also shows that justice still exists. Therefore, I am recording this incident and expressing my deep gratitude to the righteous conductor on behalf of the injured person.

"Meddling in others' affairs" is not necessarily a bad thing, and sometimes we need righteous people who "meddle in others' affairs."

### Free Clinic

— Ji Pai

Previously, this publication introduced two hospitals that provide free treatment specifically for the poor and sick: one is the American Refugee Hospital at 37 Bailinan Road, opposite the Zhaofeng Garden, and the other is the Tongsheng Hospital near Luban Road on Wangzhi Road. These are indeed a boon for the poor and sick.

Today, I would also like to introduce a traditional Chinese medicine doctor who provides "free clinics": Mr. Cao Nianxiu.

Mr. Cao's clinic is located at 17 Zhonghe Lane, Pike Road, Avenue Edward VII. He stipulates that 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM every day is the time for free clinics. During this time, no consultation fee will be charged, and those in extreme poverty will also receive some help with medication costs.

This is indeed a very powerful form of relief for the general poor and sick. I hope that all doctors in Shanghai will follow Mr. Cao's example and set aside two hours each day to fulfill humanity's duty to help the poor and sick.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

Chapter 23: Old Friends and New Companions, Articles Have Value; Famous Scenic Spots and Tourist Destinations, Leaders Gain Respect

This meal lasted for more than nine hours. After nine o'clock, it was the editors' working time, so I did not bother them any further. The ladies also went their separate ways. As they parted, Jin Danyu arranged for them to try the first family touring car tomorrow. She invited the sisters to her house to set off together. Wu Junsu said, "I can't go. I've already taken a day off today, and I can't take another one tomorrow." Jin Danyu asked, "What time do you have class tomorrow?" Wu Junsu said, "I only have class in the afternoon tomorrow." Jin Danyu said, "That's great. We'll use this touring car to take you to Soochow University in the morning. After dropping you off at school, we'll go sightseeing. For the second test drive, we'll pick a Saturday or Sunday to invite you to join us." Wu Junsu said, "What's the point of that? Won't it take up more time to send me back to school? And where are you planning to travel to? I'm afraid the roads won't be convenient." Jin Danyu laughed and said, "Because the roads are good, that's why I said that. These days, the autumn sky is high and clear, and the scenery is clear and bright. It's that time when the weather is already cool but not yet cold. The crabs are fat and the rice is ripe everywhere in Jiangnan. After the construction of the Li Lake Road along Tai Lake, we've only walked it intermittently a few times. It's said that there are several places with extremely beautiful scenery, with vast expanses of misty waves and fishing boats swaying. Mrs. Su Yali also wants to take this opportunity to travel, so we're going to Suzhou anyway, so we can conveniently take you to school." Wu Junsu said, "I see." Shao Huihua said, "Sister Junsu, how free you are as a university teacher. Now that we're all going sightseeing, you're missing out. I advise you to resign from your university teaching position next year and come to our newspaper office to be an editor." At the appointed time the next day, everyone gathered at Jin Danyu's house. Jin Danyu said that this time it could be considered a honeymoon trip, but a public honeymoon trip. Besides their new couple, there was also Mrs. Su Yali, as well as many of Jin Danyu's small preparations, all of which were new. Although China has manufactured many family touring cars, each time they are gradually improved. The improvement of these cars cannot rely solely on the cars themselves, because it is related to their raw materials and environment. For example, to build a car, there are wood, metal objects, paint, rubber wheels, etc., and China's rubber manufacturing industry is also gradually developing. In addition, there are roads. If the roads are not well-maintained, the car will also be easily damaged. So if we talk about the year, that car would be the Chinese 1951 model. (269)

### Faithful in Small Things "Whoever is faithful in small matters will also be faithful in great matters" (1)

God Himself has set an example for us to be faithful in small matters. Take the honeycomb, for example. The structure of the honeycomb is originally one of the most difficult and precise problems. One hundred and fifty years ago, famous British mathematicians and physicists discussed this problem, and they all agreed that the structure of the honeycomb is best suited to mathematical principles. God has created such a small honeycomb with such care, which is enough to prove His faithfulness in small matters. We also see that the Lord Jesus also did not despise small matters. For example, after He fed fifty people with five loaves of bread and two fish, He did not ask her, Jesus thought of the lack of patients, and told people to give them something to eat. The above few things are all positive proofs of Jesus's faithfulness in small matters. We must know that doing a small good deed or doing a small bad deed has a very important impact on our lives. A certain five decided to build a very grand church to glorify God. When the church was built, he invited many people to attend the dedication ceremony. He walked to the corner of the church wall and saw that the name engraved on the cornerstone was that of a poor widow. So he ordered people to stop the dedication ceremony and ordered people to bring the poor widow to ask her, "What have you done? Your name is engraved on the cornerstone?" The woman said that she originally wanted to contribute to the construction of the church, but she was too poor to take out money. So she often went to the fields to cut grass for the horses pulling carts to eat to fulfill her wish. Wang heard this and said, let her name be engraved on the stone, she did more than I did!

### French General's Opinion on Quinine

— M.Hhin.182

During the World War in 1916. From July to December, General Sarrail, who was then the Minister of War, said: "Our army has been disbanded in the hospital!"

After this malaria epidemic, the French government sent malaria research experts, the Sanchaud brothers, to work to prevent the French army from being completely destroyed by mosquitoes. As a result, it was stipulated that quinine should be used to radically cure various steps of malaria, and severe punishment was imposed on those who attempted to evade treatment. Rules and regulations were formulated and strictly enforced, so that this malaria eradication movement was able to achieve good results.

When General 條塞 spoke to military doctors, he mentioned the spread of malaria and the method of using quinine for treatment, please: "When engaged in the work of eradicating epidemics, the biggest enemy that is most difficult to overcome is "negligence." The regulations regarding taking quinine are like military orders, and everyone must follow them strictly, without allowing any deception or cultivation." General 佛塞 knew very well where the great enemy was, but at that time, there were no precise regulations on the use of quinine. In recent years, the League of Nations Malaria Commission has conducted long-term research and stipulated that the total amount of quinine is fifteen to twenty grains, taken continuously for five to seven days. The 124th page of the 1938 report of the Malaria Commission specifically pointed out that quinine is safe and harmless and can be used by ordinary people without the need for a doctor to supervise its use, while comprehensive drugs must be used under the supervision of a doctor.

The reason why the French troops stationed in Macedonia were not completely destroyed by malaria should be attributed to the foresight of their commanders, General Sarrail and General 佛塞. They believed that using quinine as a treatment for malaria for the army was not only a responsibility but also a necessity.
