According to Italian official sources here, the Axis powers will continue the war until France submits to peace terms.

France's Backbone is Not Broken, Determined to Fight for Freedom

London: After French Prime Minister General Pétain's important broadcast yesterday, stating "We must give up fighting," the actual situation in France remains chaotic. Initially, it was generally thought that this broadcast meant that the French army would stop fighting. However, according to reports from the front lines, the fighting continued all day yesterday.

Japan Closely Watches the Development of the European Situation

Tokyo: Japanese newspapers are now publishing news favorable to Germany. It is reported that official and non-official circles are closely watching the possible future developments in Europe, fearing that they will affect French colonies. The Asahi Shimbun said that some circles are now advocating that France should place French Vietnam and New Caledonia under the joint guarantee of Britain and Japan, because the status of these two places greatly affects Japan's security. It also said that we can no longer ignore Germany's remarks on this East Asian colonial issue, and its future trend will be greatly related to Japan's southward policy. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)

wording may have been misunderstood. It does not mean that France will unconditionally cease fire now, but that if Germany offers "honorable peace," then France will cease fire. It is expected that within the next 24 hours, any doubts about this point will be dispelled, and it will be clearly shown whether the war will continue. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)

Bordeaux: Non-official but well-informed circles here today issued an implication that if the German army attempts to advance too far in France, it may encounter an "unpleasant surprise."

The people seemed stunned by the sudden news, but all clearly paid silent attention to it. The spokesperson of the broadcasting company said that the French army had maintained peace in Europe for many years, and the consequences of today's defeat for Europe and the United States must be very significant. As far as I know, the war has not stopped, and the people are too tired and too confused to think about tomorrow. I have not seen anyone shed tears, nor have I seen any other expressions. Everything is too sudden, too important, making them at a loss as to how to deal with it. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)

(United Press Dispatch, 18th)

Madrid: Spanish Ambassador to France, Lequerica, arrived in Irun, on the French-Spanish border, today from Bordeaux.

Bordeaux: A spokesperson for the port military authorities recently said that our decision to seek peace is due to the extremely serious situation of the army on land.

In addition, after noon today, the front-line fighting is still going on. Our army is holding positions in the area from Paris to the Loire River and is launching counter-attacks against the enemy in several places. (Havas Electric Dispatch, 17th)

German Army Continues to Exert Pressure, War Has Not Yet Stopped

(1) Some units of the enemy army crossed the Loire River and have been blocked by a certain canal on the side. (2) The enemy army continues to advance east of the Loire River. (3) In the province of Poitou, the enemy army has already entered the city of Dijon.

Berlin: Well-informed and responsible sources told a Hai Tong News Agency reporter last night that the German army is continuing to advance with all its strength in France because the surrender has not yet been signed, so there has been no ceasefire to date. Any French troops who still attempt to resist will be crushed. Most of the French troops in various places have complied with General Pétain's declaration and laid down their arms. French troops are surrendering in divisions, as the Western Front fighting continued for several days after Germany requested a ceasefire in 1918. (Hai Tong Electric Dispatch, 18th)

### German Army War Report

Hitler's Headquarters: The German army war report this afternoon stated that the French army, under the pressure of the German army, continues to collapse. The Wona River has been crossed at several points, and the German army has reached the Loire River. German mechanized units have occupied the Belfort Fortress and the Le Creusot-Tione Fortress, the center of French armaments. It was occupied by the German army without fighting. The German army took this opportunity to copy the still defending Didenhofen on both sides of the Maginot Line, implementing a strategy of encircling the rear. More than 100,000 enemies were captured yesterday alone, including entire armies. The German Air Force pursued the enemy between the Loire River and the Atlantic Ocean. The railway station in Laner was bombed by German aircraft, and only trains carrying military supplies and gasoline were hit and exploded, with a loud noise. Several transport ships at the mouth of the Loire River were bombed or severely damaged, including two ships with a load of 30,000 tons, two ships with a load of 20,000 thousand tons, one ship with a load of 20,000 tons, and four ships with a load of more than 10,000 tons, as well as several small warships and cargo ships, a total of nine ships were sunk and more than one was on fire and exploded, resulting in severe damage. Last night, enemy aircraft attacked the northwest of Germany and non-military-related buildings. A total of five enemy aircraft were lost yesterday, and only one German aircraft was missing.

### Will Never Lay Down Arms Unless Honorable Peace is Obtained; French Foreign Minister Delivers Broadcast Speech

Bordeaux Port: French Foreign Minister Baudouin recently delivered a broadcast speech to the people of the country, saying, "Whenever our country encounters a time when it must decide what to choose, it always values honor above all else. Although the German army relies on its large number of personnel and sophisticated weapons, it has still failed to depress our country's morale. "This time, the people of our country are united and go to the country's difficulties together, which is unprecedented in the history of our country. Even at this moment, our determination and the honor of our army have not been damaged in the slightest. However, the new cabinet has made the necessary decisions due to the situation. In this serious period, we must solemnly declare that France still loves independence and still has confidence in the country's future. If we can obtain an honorable peace, we can cease fire, but any shameful conditions that would cause the people of our country to lose their spiritual freedom are absolutely unacceptable to us. In other words, if the French army and the entire French nation have a choice between resistance and humiliation, it is not difficult to make a decisive decision. As for Britain, it has continuously assisted in this war with its sea, land, and air forces, which is very admirable." (Havas Electric Dispatch, 17th)

Bordeaux Port: The French government issued a statement last night stating, "After General Pétain's speech, misunderstandings have already been caused by the outside world, which are inconsistent with the facts, such as saying that the government of the country has already ordered a ceasefire, which is not the truth. In fact, the war will continue to be impoverished until the conditions for a ceasefire are agreed upon between France and Germany one day. In short, although the situation is serious, our will has not been depressed, and our strength is still sufficient to defend ourselves. France exists, and the world can continue to exist. This belief has become stronger over time. If the conditions for a ceasefire are harmful to France's honor and independence, then we must continue to fight. This has been explained by Foreign Minister Baudouin in a broadcast speech yesterday afternoon." (Havas Electric Dispatch, 17th)

Editorial

### Analysis and Prospects of France's Armistice

As this commentary is being written, telegrams from all over the world are reporting conflicting news. In short, the European situation has fallen into an extremely chaotic state, and the future of Europe is approaching an extremely contradictory fork in the road. But this chaos and contradiction cannot last for long. Everything will probably be clear within a few dozen hours. The only thing that is certain at the moment is that on the 17th, the day before yesterday, the newly appointed Prime Minister of France, General Pétain, did, on behalf of the French government, announce to his enemies and his people his intention to prepare for an armistice. Let us now analyze this point.

If what General Pétain announced ultimately becomes a reality, then German leader Hitler's strategy of divide and conquer will once again achieve victory. Long before the outbreak of the war, observers in various countries, even those governing countries, had seen clearly that the Allied forces of Britain and France had two of the most serious weaknesses: First, France's human resources were at an absolute disadvantage. Second, the imbalance in the tasks undertaken by Britain and France in land warfare was enough to make it difficult for the authorities on both sides to manage appropriately. For the past two or three years, Britain and France have appeared harmonious and seamless on the surface, almost seeming to be one entity. But in reality, both sides have had an extremely serious problem, which the authorities on both sides have pondered deeply, meticulously, and painstakingly, and tried to manage appropriately, but have never exposed this dispute: the issue of Britain implementing conscription. In the end, although Britain reluctantly agreed, it was not completely resolved, and it became a hidden source of dispute. On the French side, former Allied Commander General Gamelin attached even greater importance to this issue. On the British side, far-sighted people like Eden, Hoare, and Belisha, over the course of two or three years, also repeatedly and tirelessly called for and advocated the early implementation of universal conscription. However, due to the obstruction of many stubborn forces, a half-hearted conscription system was implemented only on the eve of the declaration of war. When the disaster of war came, Britain did its best to send an expeditionary force, and although the French side repeatedly praised it in the friendliest manner, in reality, it could not meet France's hopes, let alone military needs. Therefore, on the one hand, it caused a part of the French people to develop a mood of defeatism and to harbor pessimism about the future of the war. On the other hand, it also made France recognize the difficulties and dangers from the facts and reason. They recognized that Britain could not be deeply relied upon. This was the annoyance that both Britain and France gritted their teeth and did not want to reveal in the slightest, and it was also the inside story that those who sympathized with Britain and France and knew their internal affairs did not want to reveal from the sidelines. It was also what the German and Italian propaganda machines took as excellent material and used in many ways.

By the time the central figures of Britain and France succeeded each other, that is, when Britain's Churchill and France's Reynaud took the stage and formed cabinets one after another, it was generally expected that France's aforementioned hidden pain and estrangement with Britain could be dispelled without a trace, strengthening the psychological and rational basis of the alliance between the two countries, so that the future victory or defeat would become a common destiny of complete coincidence. Unexpectedly, even the warmest enthusiasm could not make up for the extremely serious facts. With Churchill and Reynaud, these two outstanding figures with vision and courage, finally unable to salvage the almost congenital defects, France had to abandon its vows to advance, retreat, and fight together with Britain, and unilaterally declared an armistice. Whether friends or enemies of France, no one in humanity should not shed tears of sympathy for France!

War must be fought with the life and death of the nation, and life and death are of course put aside, but victory and defeat are not accidental. To put it succinctly, the key lies in quickly seizing the other side's weaknesses: First, he has the danger of being attacked on both sides, that is, what he fears most is fighting on the eastern and western fronts at the same time. Second, he has the necessity of relying on foreign countries, that is, what he cannot withstand is being blockaded tightly for a long time. Britain and France knew their weaknesses, wanted to seize them, and planned to seize them, and gradually implemented their seizure, but they lost out on not being quick enough. If they had immediately seized it at the moment when the German-Polish War broke out, that is, nine months ago, then what situation would appear today is something that no one dares to say.

Britain and France repeatedly missed the opportunity, and from everything to everything, they had to go through a kind of delay, a kind of frustration, and then they were in a passive position, and no matter how long they were, they could not发挥 them. In contrast, Germany seized its own opportunity, seized the other side's weaknesses, tightly grasped France's fatal injury, and used its unique "lightning war" tactics, pouring the strength of the whole country, like a wind and cloud, and a quick battle, almost like destroying the old and decaying and deciding. This made France's first weakness of a lack of manpower completely exposed without room for breathing, and it fell into an irremediable situation. And Italy's sudden participation in the war, at least spiritually, dealt France a serious blow. In this moment of survival and extinction, although Britain and France were subjectively in a common destiny, objectively, the degree of their hardships and encounters was completely different. Thus, the second weakness that could not be shared between the two countries exploded.

Telegrams from all over the world, as of when the reporter is writing, are only enough to make retrospective explanations, not enough to make future inferences. As for how the trend of the nearest future will be decided, it still does not go beyond the key points that this newspaper obtained yesterday. To put it simply, to repeat: First, the conditions of Germany and Italy will not be recognized by France, and there is a risk of renewed incidents. Second, how the French Navy is has become the most important factor in whether France can obtain peace, whether Britain will continue to fight, that is, the future Berlin battle situation. Third, the attitudes of the Soviet Union, Spain, Turkey, and the United States, directly or indirectly, latently or overtly, will inevitably be a major weight in the future situation.

The world is now standing on a fork in the road. We should closely watch the reports of the next few dozen hours!

### France Encounters Misfortune, Britain's Determination to Fight Increases, Will Not Stop Until the Nazi Threat is Eliminated; British Prime Minister Churchill Delivers Broadcast Speech

London: Prime Minister Churchill delivered a broadcast speech last night, declaring that although France has surrendered, Britain will continue to fight with unwavering determination. He said, "The events that have occurred in France have not changed Britain's beliefs and goals in the slightest. We have now become the only hero holding a weapon to defend universalism. We will do our best to live up to this noble honor. We will defend this island and fight together with the British Empire around us without being overcome by the enemy, until everyone's brow no longer curses Hitler. We dare to decide that we will eventually win. "The Prime Minister also said, "I am very sad that the heroic people of France have fallen into this tragic misfortune. Our emotions towards them and our belief that the genius of France will be revived will not be changed by anything." (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)

### British Prime Minister Reports on the War Situation in the House of Commons: States Reasons for France's Surrender; Britain Has Fulfilled its Greatest Obligation of Assistance

London: Today, the House of Commons was packed with people to listen to Prime Minister Churchill deliver the most important speech of the war, stating the reasons why France requested Germany to cease hostilities. His speech was roughly as follows:

The other day, I mentioned that when the French Commander-in-Chief discovered that the German army had decisively broken through the French defense line at Sedan and the Meuse River, he did not immediately withdraw the troops north of that area, resulting in a major military disaster. His indecisiveness caused the French army to lose fifteen or sixteen divisions, and made it impossible for the entire British Expeditionary Force to exert its power to cope with this critical period. Our army and 120,000 French troops were trapped in Dunkirk. Thanks to the efforts of the British Navy, they escaped danger, but the only losses were artillery and modern military equipment. This setback will inevitably require several weeks to make up for the losses. From then on, the French army repeatedly suffered defeats, and this was the reason. We will do everything possible to re-equip and send every soldier we can to France as soon as possible, and transport their military supplies.

All the conquered countries will be restored in the future. The great battle of France is over, and the great battle of Britain is about to begin. If we are unfortunately defeated, the whole world, including the United States, will sink into the abyss of a new dark age. The great battle of France failed due to unfortunate flaws in military strategy. This flaw was caused by the unprecedented capabilities of the German armored divisions and the fact that the number of German troops exceeded that of the Allied forces.

Britain now has 1.25 million soldiers in arms, 500,000 local volunteer defense groups, and a large number of military supplies, rifles and bullets salvaged in France. In addition, there are large armies from the Dominions and the Royal Navy to help. (Cheers) At present, we need to be very cautious and not afraid of hard work, but there is no need to panic at all. (Great cheers)

If France does not continue to fight in accordance with its treaty obligations, it will abandon its great opportunity and its future. We feel that this treaty obligation cannot be avoided.

We must now adhere to our duties and do our best. If the British Empire and the Commonwealth exist for a thousand years, the people should still say that this was one of their greatest moments. (Prolonged cheers) I am stating these facts not to blame anyone. In my personal judgment, it is completely useless (cheers) and even harmful to launch attacks at this time. We can hardly tolerate it. The reason why I am stating these facts is to clarify that we have not been able to participate in this great war with twelve or thirteen divisions of the British army, as we should have been able to, but only three divisions participated. All of this will be put aside, and future historians will refer to all the documents and make a fair judgment.

This small principle can also be applied to our own domestic affairs. Now there are many people who want to investigate why the actions of the government and Congress in recent years have led to this current disaster. They attempt to blame those responsible for guiding our affairs. (The audience shouts, "Hear, hear!") This is also a foolish and harmful act. There are indeed many people responsible for this. Now everyone should act according to their conscience and constantly reflect on their words, just as I reflect on myself. I dare say that if we start a dispute between the past and the present, we will surely lose our future. (The audience shouts, "Hear, hear!" (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### Britain Proposed to France the Formation of a United Nation: To Concentrate Forces to Encircle Justice and Freedom; Ceasefire Plan of France Failed to Materialize

London: The British Broadcasting Corporation has just issued a message stating that the British government, in order to assist France, yesterday proposed to the French government that the two countries solemnly conclude a joint convention, and submitted a draft declaration to France, stating that the governments of Britain and France declare that they will be a united nation of Britain and France from now on and will no longer be divided into two countries. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

London: In order to assist and support France through the serious period it is experiencing and to encourage the French government to continue to fight, the British government proposed a solemn joint action between the two countries, so the following draft was delivered to the French government on June 16 by the British Ambassador to France. The original text is as follows: 1. At this most important moment in the modern world, the British and French governments declare their inseparable union and unwavering determination to jointly defend justice and freedom from succumbing to a system that reduces mankind to puppets and slaves. The two governments now declare that Britain and France are no longer two countries, but a single Anglo-French Union. The organization of this union will provide for joint defense, diplomacy, finance, and economic policies. Every French citizen will immediately enjoy British citizenship, and every British citizen will become a citizen of France. The two countries will share the responsibility for restoring the war damage within their territories. The resources of both sides will be used equally for this purpose as a whole. During the war, there should be a single war cabinet, and all British and French naval and air forces will be under its command. The British Empire is already raising new troops, and France will transfer all the forces it can use to the land, sea and air battlefields. This union calls on the United States to consolidate the resources of the Allied countries and to provide strong material assistance for the common purpose. This union will concentrate all its efforts to resist the enemy's forces, no matter where the war occurs, and strive for our final victory. According to responsible sources here, this declaration of Anglo-French Union is based on France continuing to fight. Now that France has requested a ceasefire, this plan may be considered temporarily a thing of the past, but if there is a possibility of a change in the future environment, the suggestion may be considered again. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### Britain Continues to Call Up New Recruits

London: According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Labor yesterday, in July, men of the third class will continue to be registered to serve in the military. The statement said that the number of people being called up is increasing rapidly, and the physical examination is being accelerated.

The third registration in July is for men who have reached the age of 30, 31, and 32. Those who have reached the age of 29 will register on the 22nd of this month. So far, a total of 2.8 million men have registered. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### British Dominions Intensify Assistance to Britain in the War: Australia is Virtually Becoming the Empire's Arsenal; New Zealand Implements Compulsory Conscription

Sydney: Australia has become the arsenal of the British Empire. The depth charge bombs used by American destroyers to attack enemy submarines are Australian products. Soon, Australian-made aircraft bombs will also fall on the enemy's front and rear lines. Australian-made weapons, from the smallest to the largest, are numerous. Official and private factories are now working day and night, producing and transporting them in a steady stream. From September 1, last year to March 31, this year, the various items ordered by the Department of Supply cost over £14.45 million. This can slightly explain the speed of Australia's war organization development since the outbreak of the war. Since then, expenses have gradually increased, and now Australia's defense expenses have increased to between 5 and 6 million per month. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

Wellington: The New Zealand government today ordered the implementation of compulsory conscription. The regulations stipulate that men aged 16 and some of those selected from the reservists will be formed into a general reserve army. Reservists will be selected by lottery.

According to eyewitnesses, many people were killed and injured on the spot, but the crowd gathered more and more and gathered in front of the post office and the police station. At 8:15 p.m., the crowd attempted to attack the police station, so both sides opened fire. The crowd retreated, and the police received reinforcements from the army, defeated the demonstrating crowd, and sent armored vehicles to patrol the streets. At 11:30 p.m., the city was cleared, but the suburbs were still in chaos. Last night, Soviet tanks, mechanized infantry, and artillery arrived in Lajing. The Soviet troops then sent tanks to defend the main traffic arteries in the city and occupied the post office and the train station.

### United States Will Not Recognize Transfer of Territorial Rights in the Western Hemisphere: This Bill Passed by the Senate; United States Stops Paying French Credit Loans and Funds

Washington: The Senate passed an important bill last night stating that the United States will not recognize any non-American country transferring the territory of the Western Hemisphere to another non-American country. It is reported that this bill will be submitted to the House of Representatives for a vote today. (Associated Press dispatch, 18th)

Washington: US Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that the State Department is closely studying all the problems arising from the recent developments in Europe, but there is absolutely no news about France's request for a ceasefire. The future of the French colonies in the Western Hemisphere is also one of the issues under study. The State Department does not believe that there is any change in the status of the US Ambassador to Paris or the French Ambassador to Washington. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

Washington: Senators Connally and Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, are urging the immediate passage of legislation declaring that the United States will not acquiesce to any non-American country transferring its colonies in the Western Hemisphere to another non-American country. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

Washington: According to some well-informed sources here, senior administrative officials have suggested that the United States should completely sever diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy to express sympathy for the Allied countries and eliminate the activities of the "Fifth Column." News from France has shrouded Washington in gloom. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

Washington: President Roosevelt has signed a document stopping the payment of French credit loans and funds in the United States. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

Washington: The US government has recently decided to accelerate the implementation of the Pan-American "Charter" system (i.e., commercial trust) to control the market prices of wheat, cotton, beef, and coffee. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

New York: News about France's preparation for an armistice has caused great surprise here. All the newspapers have published extras, carrying the news. Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary of State Welles jointly visited President Roosevelt to discuss the latest developments in the European situation. (Haitong dispatch, 18th)

US Government is Studying Controlling the American Economy

Washington: The US Government Committee has received an order from President Roosevelt to begin studying the plan for the Western Hemisphere to deal with the business groups of totalitarian countries. The White House announced that the President has issued an order to temporarily freeze France's deposits in the United States, totaling $1.1 billion, to prevent Germany from withdrawing funds for reparations. Officials said that the business groups of North and South American countries can negotiate conditions with Germany to avoid being hit by the German-controlled European economic group when each country negotiates separately. When the committee began discussing, Secretary of State Hull hurriedly arrived and met with Roosevelt. Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, Secretary of Commerce Hopkins, Secretary of Agriculture Wallace, and accompanying advisors all participated in the meeting, which lasted two hours before adjourning. Hull announced that details of the meeting would be published soon. At the same time, the White House announced that the committee had studied the trade problems of American countries with Europe. The final report will be submitted to the President in a short period of time. If the President approves this plan, he will submit it to the governments of American countries for their opinions. If the British Empire collapses, the United States will also invite the Dominions of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa to participate in this plan. It is said that US Army and Navy experts are waiting for telegrams from Europe, hoping to obtain news about the fate of the French fleet. They believe that if the French Navy also surrenders to Germany, the end of the British Isles is approaching. Authoritative sources said that the Western Hemisphere business plan has not yet been specifically determined and will be finalized according to the development of the European situation. The committee is considering three possible approaches: (1) The organization of an agency by the American countries to control the import and export trade of the Western Hemisphere countries. (2) Purchasing the surplus export goods of Latin American countries for resale. (3) The customs union of the American countries unifies the tariff barriers of Western Hemisphere commerce. It is generally believed that this plan will constitute a supplement to the British blockade against Germany, but this decision will make countries such as Belgium and France feel hunger like Germany, and its impact is very subtle. (International dispatch, 18th)

Washington: The White House announced today that the Committee has studied the most effective way to export surplus goods from the Western Hemisphere and make it profitable, and the matter is now imminent. Responsible circles here explained that a Pan-American Trading Company will be established, and the American countries will be shareholders. The United States will provide the majority of the capital. The company will purchase all exports at an average price and grant foreign sovereignty at the highest price possible. However, most of the transactions will be at a loss. This plan has the nature of the United States subsidizing several American countries. It is now believed that the intention is to prevent the continued intrusion of German economic power into South America. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

The French embassy is currently seeking a site on the south bank of the Yangtze River, but not because of Japanese warnings, but because staff cannot work under continuous bombing. The US, Italian, and Belgian embassies are all on the south bank of the Yangtze River.

Three Japanese Planes Shot Down the Day Before Yesterday

Chongqing. Japanese planes attacked Chongqing in successive days. Today, they came in four batches to bomb, dropping more than 400 new-style "super-heavy bombs", killing and wounding approximately 300 civilians, and damaging many hospitals and schools. However, the Japanese planes also suffered extremely heavy losses. A Havas reporter witnessed the passage of the first batch of Japanese planes as they attacked Chongqing. The second to fourth air raids, however, all happened in the suburbs and could not be seen. The first batch of Japanese planes that flew over Chongqing consisted of 36 heavy bombers. At that time, it was 1:30 pm. Fifteen Chinese fighter planes were patrolling in the sky. Seeing the Japanese planes flying in, they immediately swooped down and attacked them, with some attacking from the side. A Japanese plane was immediately hit and caught fire, crashing in the eastern suburbs of Chongqing. At 2:30 pm, the second batch of Japanese planes arrived, totaling 27. The Chinese fighter planes immediately flew to intercept them. Because it was farther from the city, the details of the battle could not be witnessed. However, it is known that approximately three Japanese planes were shot down this time. Most of the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes fell into the river. The wooden houses inhabited by poor people along the coast were all destroyed. The western and central districts of Chongqing were also bombed, with black smoke billowing everywhere, from the western district to the entire city. The American gunboat "Tutela" was docked on the south bank of the Yangtze River and was almost hit. The French Catholic Church suffered the most damage, and its adjacent school was completely destroyed. At the same time, the American Methodist Women's School was also completely destroyed, and many civilian houses caught fire after being hit, and are still burning. Furthermore, according to military experts, the Japanese planes used the latest type of bombs for the first time today, and their destructive power is quite strong. From the losses suffered in the bombing in recent days, it can be seen that the Japanese air raids on Chongqing are purely terrorist in nature. The bombs they dropped have no specific targets, and most of them fell in densely populated areas. For example, the Chongqing Hotel, where foreign residents and journalists from various countries reside, was also destroyed. (17th Havas Dispatch)

### In the Midst of Great Changes in the European War: The Position of French Indochina

Although the European war has caused France to expend large amounts of financial and military resources, the grand plan for protecting the security of Vietnam, carried out by France, has not been reduced.

Since the summer of 1937, the military expenditure spent by France on the fortification of this rich and prosperous colony has exceeded 3,000,000,000 francs. In addition, in the budgets of the Vietnamese government for 1938 and 1939, 40,000,000 Vietnamese piasters were added each year for national defense. At the ordinary price of Vietnamese currency, one piaster equals ten francs, so the military expenditure in the past two years has been 8,000,000,000 francs.

France is spending a large amount of military expenditure on a colony in a corner, because it fears that Japan has designs on this rich tropical colony. Japan has already occupied Nanning in Guangxi Province, which is only twenty-two miles from the border of French Indochina, and only one hundred and sixty-five miles from Hanoi and the northern ports of Haiphong.

What surprised the French even more was that Japan had already occupied Hainan Island and the Paracel Islands. These two military strongholds are only three hundred and thirty miles away from Galong Bay in the north and northeast, where France has built fortifications, aiming to make it France's main naval base. France has also built small naval bases in Haiphong (only one hundred and twenty-five miles from the west coast of Hainan Island) and Saigon, but neither of these places is suitable for warships of 12,000 tons to enter and exit.

Currently, Vietnam may be the weakest link in France's vast colonies. At the same time, in the East, it is believed that if France encounters foreign attacks, it can obtain air and naval assistance from the Singapore naval base.

In June last year, all the military leaders of the French Far East participated in the military conference of the British colonies and autonomous territories in the East. The conference passed a proposal advocating mutual liaison regarding the defense of the British and French territories in the Pacific.

Since the outbreak of the European war in September last year, the French Indochina government has passed a new two-year military special tax, hoping to increase 14,000,000 Vietnamese piasters each year, which means that in 1941, it can obtain military expenditure of 280,000,000 francs. In addition, postal fees, property rights and deed registration fees, and all export taxes have been increased. Some items of financial expenditure have even increased taxes by as much as 50%.

In mid-July last year, the French Minister of Colonies, in a report to the President, roughly described Vietnam's new national defense plan. Several items he mentioned: doubling the number of appropriate defense soldiers, a large-scale expansion of the air force plan, including the purchase of fifty aircraft from the Netherlands, and a plan for the industrial development of Vietnam, especially making it an independent unit, without the need to import munitions from France, and developing the aircraft and motor manufacturing industries, and precise plans to fortify Galong Bay.

When the French Minister of Colonies drafted the report, the French Indochina air force only had six squadrons, but since then, it has increased substantially. A French aircraft company called "Rhône-Poulenc" is building a factory that will be able to produce 150 aircraft and 400 motors per year.

According to estimates by the French Minister of Colonies, within one month after the mobilization order, Vietnam can slightly adjust 100,000 trained, well-armed indigenous soldiers to the battlefield. These soldiers will be composed of Annamese, Cambodians, Tonkinese, and other indigenous people. The Annamese had very little ability in the Great War, except for clearing the battlefield and doing hard labor in the rear.

According to French officers, unless there is a French junior officer for every ten indigenous troops, they can avoid collapsing after firing.

Several Vietnamese airfields have been rapidly increased, and the extent of the increase is definitely not due to civilian aviation reasons, and many new military highways are being completed at an accelerated rate. At the beginning of this year, Vietnam already had 21,000 miles of modern highways, one-third of which are asphalt roads.

France does not think that there will be an independence movement among the Vietnamese natives. This is significantly different from the European war from 1914 to 1918, when the Vietnamese took advantage of France's troubles in Europe and attempted to oppose France, resulting in high-pressure policies.

France is easier to deal with in its Far Eastern colonies than Britain. The subjects of British India are involved in the European war, openly refuse to cooperate, and demand independence. The main reason why the Vietnamese are peacefully under French rule is that they believe that getting rid of French rule will inevitably lead to Japanese rule. They would rather be under French rule than Japanese rule.

The current attitude of the Vietnamese towards Japan is obviously different from a few years ago. Previously, the people of French Tonkin believed that Japan was the leader of the Eastern nations to be liberated from the rule of Western European imperialism.

They used to think that a well-intentioned Japan could be relied upon to overthrow French rule and become an independent country. Japanese power was extremely inflated for a period, and Japanese spies cooperated closely with indigenous revolutionary forces.

Japan's actions in China and the exposure of its ambitions for tropical Asian colonies have changed all this. The Vietnamese believe that Japan has no good intentions towards Vietnam or other Asian countries.

The Vietnamese are shocked by the atrocities of the Japanese army in China and believe that Japan's invasion this time is a conquest action. They then realized that joining Japan to expel France would give Japan control from the very beginning.

After the outbreak of the European war, the French had many fears. France was deeply afraid that the natives would rise up in rebellion, so France decided to use military personnel with military power to rule Vietnam. The thoughtful and peaceful approach of Brévié was transferred away, and General Catroux replaced him as Governor-General. France is making the most of Vietnamese manpower and resources for use in the European war.

In order to keep pace with the French government's self-sufficiency plan, the production of agricultural and mineral raw materials that can be used for British and French needs, or can be exported in exchange for foreign exchange, is being intensified. The area of new tea planting is also being expanded. Livestock, leather, rice, and rubber are all listed as items to increase production.

The production of tin and zinc for British and French industries has also increased substantially. The Hongji Company's large amount of anthracite coal has also prepared a large number for the needs of the war.

Detachments of indigenous troops—mainly for sappers and engineering teams—have already been transferred to France, and more than 100,000 new Vietnamese troops are also in progress. French officers declare that a large number of Vietnamese are willing to be volunteers and are already sufficient.

For a superficial observer, the European war seems to have very little impact on Vietnam. Prices have increased slightly because imported goods are scarce, partly due to exchange controls. American cigarettes and British whiskey are difficult to obtain, customs and police patrols are stricter, and people in uniform are more conspicuous. Other than that, the signs of war are not easy to see. Especially away from the urban areas, the lives of the natives are even more unaffected by the European war.

### ### Japan and the European War: Evidence Shows the Trend Will Shift with the Defeat of Britain and Germany; Currently Adopting Opportunism; Internally Coveting the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam

When the European war developed to its highest stage, news of the Chinese war was not widely read in Japan. The Japanese see that this is a life-and-death struggle between one world and another, and they feel very close to the battlefield. They may not participate in the war, but they cannot be unaffected by the outcome of the European war. This is not only a question of what kind of world they will live in, but also of how their future will be affected.

A Japanese told reporters that if Germany wins, Japan will become like Germany. If the democratic countries win, national socialism will be ignored, and Japan will turn from extreme right-wing to a central position.

Japanese public opinion is formally neutral, but emotionally pro-German. The press is unanimously sympathetic to Finland for the Soviet Union's aggression, but has no sympathy for Norway, Finland, or Belgium. Right-wing newspapers, such as the Hochi Shimbun and the Kokumin Shimbun, hope that Germany will triumph and then create a new era based on national socialism.

Among the Japanese, there are also a small number of expatriates who sympathize with Britain and France. In Japan's profitable commerce, 80% of every US dollar is transacted with the United States and the British Empire, and most businessmen praise Britain and the United States. In addition, there are most of the older generation of educators and Japanese Christians, who also belong to this category.

At the other extreme are the sympathizers of the National Socialist Party and the Fascist Party, although few in number, but powerful. They are all young officers and bureaucrats. Among the people, all the young people who join patriotic organizations hope for Germany's victory.

The whole country believes that the diplomatic path followed by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita in the conflicts of the empires is regular. He believes that the future world will become a new type, no longer a free individualistic civilization, allowing all small countries to have legal and political equality and coexistence.

This new world will become a combination of vast areas, each group centered on a powerful country. The Americas will form such a group under the United States of America, East Asia must be placed under Japanese hegemony, and Central Europe must be controlled by Germany. The Soviet Union itself is large enough to form two units. Britain and France believe that there is still enough to exist, although their empires will inevitably shrink.

Japan's national policy is opportunistic in method and extremely clear and simple in principle. Its purpose is to make Japan the leader of East Asia, that is, in addition to the "new order" in China, to create a Monroe Doctrine in the Western Pacific, without foreign colonies within Japan's sphere of influence.

The Dutch East Indies is very backward in autonomy. If the Netherlands loses these colonies, Japan will claim to be its protector. It is extremely jealous of small countries having such rich colonies. Japan's policy of economic aggression can run rampant and can wait for the opportunity to move.

What Japan is most concerned about in the Dutch East Indies is the safe supply of oil, rubber, and tin, which are essential for several wars and industries. It is somewhat excessive to prohibit the Dutch from using their own production for their own defense. But the Netherlands has no way to go, so it has to cater to Japan's will, and Britain and France agree.

What is a mystery is the attitude of the Soviet Union. After Germany's defeat, will the Soviet Union concentrate its forces to deal with Japan? After Hitler's victory, will the Soviet Union be dragged into the German regional empire, eventually making Japan feel a greater danger than communism? Those are all "perhaps" questions. At present, Japan is expanding its army, expanding its fortification zone, and starting to enlist soldiers in Manchuria, preparing for the unknown situation in the future.

### ### Sino-German Cultural Association Holds Fifth Annual Meeting; The Conference Deeply Hopes That Sino-German Culture Will Be Carried Forward and Take on the Mission of Establishing World Peace Together

(Chongqing Aviation News) The Sino-German Cultural Association held its fifth annual meeting at the Jialing Hotel on the evening of June 7. Chen Lifu, representing Gu Yuxiu, Ren Xiping and Meng Jianmin representing the Ministry of Social Affairs, Zhu Shimin representing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lu Yawen representing the German Embassy, and more than 130 members from both China and Germany attended. First, Chairman Zhu Jiahua delivered the opening speech, followed by speeches by Gu Yuxiu and Meng Jianmin, then Jiang Fuli reported on the association's affairs and revised the constitution and passed the declaration. Finally, Lu Yawen and Shen Keyan, the representative of the German News Agency, spoke. The meeting ended at about 10 o'clock. The opening speech of Chairman Zhu and the declaration are recorded as follows:

Opening speech by Chairman Zhu

Ladies and gentlemen, the Sino-German Cultural Association has had a history of five years. During these five years, the whole world has been shrouded in the clouds of war, and the East and the West are full of flames of war. In such an environment, we are still able to promote cultural work, which is really gratifying. And we are holding the fifth annual meeting of the Sino-German Cultural Association today, which is especially special and important. The whole world is living in war, which is the misfortune of mankind and the misfortune of the cultural world. China has been fighting alone for three years to protect the independence of the country and the survival of the nation. China has also done its utmost to maintain its culture, that is, to maintain the vanguard of human culture, and to fight to the death with the Japanese warlords who are engaged in destroying culture. China has already done its utmost to bear the burden and has made great contributions to the world. Before the Japanese warlords have completely realized that they should withdraw from Chinese territory and have not realized the greatness and inviolability of Chinese culture, the Chinese people will unite to overthrow this public enemy of culture. China's response is unchanged. The belief of the Chinese people is as firm as steel. Now, unfortunately, the war is proceeding rapidly, and the damage to human culture is huge and unimaginable. All those engaged in cultural work in the world are saddened and regretful. War is like a contagious disease. When the September 18 Incident occurred, China announced to the world that this was the beginning of a great disaster for the world. At that time, the United States realized the seriousness of the situation and proposed to jointly put it out, but unfortunately it was understood by various countries, resulting in today. The war will not stop and will burn itself. We sincerely hope that the European war will not expand and will end as soon as possible, because without peace and order, no culture will be carried forward. Everyone should preserve their vitality and seek timely peace on the basis of their achievements. The spread and prolongation of the European war will inevitably lead to mutual destruction, or even the destruction of human culture. The genius and intelligence specially endowed by the German nation, its contribution to culture, is admired by everyone. We hope that the German nation can make greater contributions to human culture and make great efforts to lay the foundation for world peace. After the last World War, President Wilson's peace proposals were to the point, but unfortunately the peace mechanisms that emerged later still harbored hatred, resulting in crises everywhere and finally wars following each other, without a single peaceful day. Our Premier Sun also earnestly advised all countries to jointly help China build and develop its inexhaustible resources, in order to resolve the economic contradictions between countries after the war and eliminate the factors of future wars, but this suggestion was not valued by politicians in various countries. Although this matter is separated by twenty years, we believe that it is still the great way to seek world peace. We would like to especially call the attention of German politicians to this. Sino-German culture has had more and more contact and closer relations since the 17th century, and especially now. The communication and promotion of culture between the two countries is closely related to the establishment of world peace. We deeply hope that the people of China and Germany will shoulder the common mission and successfully allocate it.

Declaration issued by the conference

The declaration of the conference said that the mission of the Sino-German Cultural Association is to communicate the culture of China and Germany, to make it flourish, and to promote the friendship between the two countries, to make it more and more harmonious. In recent years, the evolution of the international situation has affected the Far East, but this has not hindered the promotion of Sino-German cultural work in the slightest. China's war of resistance has entered the fourth era. What China seeks is to preserve the independence and freedom of the country, and to maintain the work of equality and mutual benefit between countries. Therefore, the war of resistance and national construction are carried out at the same time. The foundation of its will is firm, and the clarity of its position has long been celebrated by the world. Now that the European war is in full swing, we Chinese people, in addition to moving forward with a consistent belief, we believe that Germany in its current state should seize a good opportunity to realize a just and impartial peace, so as to devote itself to the promotion of world culture, and the German nation with its innate intelligence has made greater contributions in academia. Japan has been a scourge to the Far East for decades. Its painstaking efforts are to seek the realization of the so-called "New Order in East Asia." In other words, it is to exclude the rights and interests of other countries in East Asia and attempt to monopolize them. China's heroic war of resistance has revealed and shattered Japan's poisonous plots layer by layer and step by step. In view of this silent war, Japan obviously wants to take advantage of the opportunity to move, in order to fulfill its intention of taking advantage of the fire. If Japan gets its wish, it will not only be a misfortune for East Asia, but also a misfortune for Germany. Germany has its long-standing historical position in East Asia, its economic, commercial, and cultural close relations. If the East Asia door is indeed closed by Japan, then all European and American countries will be excluded, and Germany will certainly not be an exception. Japan's anti-German behavior in the Far East during the last World War can serve as a lesson. Moreover, the result of Japan's war of aggression against China has become the end of a crossbow, and it is neither a so-called stable force in East Asia, nor can it play a decisive role in the international arena or help to reverse any situation. We firmly believe that the authorities in Germany should not be confused by Japan and repeat the previous mistakes. If the Pacific War breaks out unfortunately, the prolongation of the European War and the reversal of the situation are expected, and the future of world peace is even more distant and hopeless. Regarding the above points, we dare to hold them up to arouse the attention of the German people. The German authorities also have the necessity to reconsider their foreign policy towards the Far East at this time in terms of the situation and the reason. The regenerating China sincerely accepts the cooperation from friendly countries. We deeply hope that Germany can weigh the pros and cons in the Far East in time and determine its choice, and especially hope that Sino-German relations will have a new era unfolding. We will do our best to strive for it.

### Zhejiang College of Arts and Sciences Resumes University in Autumn; Reorganized into Three Colleges of Arts, Commerce and Engineering

Hangzhou Zhejiang University, founded to date, has been ninety-five years. At first, the school originated in Ningbo, named Chongxin Yidian, when Emperor Daoguang of the Qing Dynasty was in the twenty-fifth year of his reign. In the sixth year of Tongzhi, it moved to Hangzhou, renamed Yuying, and its degree gradually increased. In the first year of Xuantong, it moved to the Qiantang River and changed its name to Zhejiang University. Because of the change in the school system in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, and the fact that no Chinese person could serve as the president for a time, it was suspended for one year. After its restoration in the autumn of the eighteenth year, two colleges were temporarily established, and it was registered as Zhejiang College of Arts and Sciences. It has been eleven years since then. Since the school's restoration, the faculty and facilities have been progressing year by year, and the number of students has also been increasing year by year. This spring, the board of directors had the idea of resuming the three colleges and restoring the university. It is heard that the university plan has been approved by the original founder in the United States and has been approved by the Ministry of Education. Starting from the autumn of this year, three colleges of arts, commerce and engineering will be established. The College of Arts will have departments of Chinese, English, Politics, and Education, etc. The College of Commerce will have departments of Financial Management, Transportation Management, Trade, and Banking, etc. The College of Engineering will have departments of Civil Engineering, Architecture, Chemistry, and Mechanical Engineering, etc. Students in the Department of Economics of the old College of Arts will be transferred to the College of Commerce, and students in the Department of Chemistry of the College of Science will be transferred to the Department of Chemical Engineering. During this period of war resistance and national construction, the school can especially focus on practical science to enhance the power of construction, and its contribution to the future of China will be very great. Enrollment of new students in Su, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Anhui will begin on June 21

### Finance - Mixed News Affecting Foreign Exchange - Different Perceptions Among Operators

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. Although news from Europe could have affected the market, the impact of positive and negative news varied depending on the operator. The range of fluctuations was narrow. Initially, the cessation of French resistance against Germany caused the exchange rate between the United States and Britain to fall sharply by 4.5 points. In the morning, the British pound was stable against the US dollar. Speculators first dumped the US dollar, but HSBC and Japanese banks absorbed it. Importers were also active. At 10:30 AM, the exchange rates were 3.90625 for the British pound and 5.90625 yuan for the US dollar. Afterwards, MacGalli and a certain American bank suddenly sold, and the China Bank also dumped. Moreover, a private telegram stated that Britain and France would reorganize a joint anti-German government, and the British pound and French franc would be maintained by the United States. The market became firmer. In the afternoon, the Hong Kong Electric and China Bank sold slightly, while the American bank and Sassoon bought. The exchange rate between the United States and Britain is expected to remain small today. The US dollar was strong, closing at 3.9375 for the British pound and 5.90625 yuan for the US dollar.

### Conflicting News from Europe - The Gold Market Not Greatly Stimulated - Varying Motivations for Buying and Selling

Yesterday's black market for cash gold lingered in a state of hesitation. Operators were not stimulated by the changes in Europe. There is no impact at present, and further developments are awaited. Trading was still active throughout the day, but the fluctuations, although tortuous, were not huge. The morning opening was 5,580 yuan. After a certain gold company vigorously absorbed it and money changers purchased it, it rose to 5,640 yuan. Later, securities firms, cash houses, and retail investors started a selling spree, and it once fell back to 5,540 yuan. Afterwards, money changers, a certain gold company, and silver houses took advantage of the low price to buy in. At the same time, the foreign exchange market was tight, causing the price to rise again to 5,670 yuan. The afternoon closed down by 100 yuan. The market was initially weak. Silver houses sold the most. However, it was heard that the foreign exchange market was still slightly tight, and buyers were excited, raising the price to 5,625 yuan. The closing price was still 5,590 yuan, an increase of 15 yuan compared with the closing price of the night before yesterday. The total transaction volume was more than 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold was initially priced high but ended up flat. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.

Cash Gold Rises by 15 Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (10 taels), initially with a stable exchange rate, slightly increased by 5 yuan at the opening. Money changers entered silver houses at 5,580 yuan. Then, due to the selling by the gold and silver houses, a certain money changer lacked buying power, and it fell by 20 yuan. Gold houses sold securities to the amount of 10 taels, lower than 5,560 yuan. Suddenly, the foreign exchange market tightened, and buying interest soared. Gold houses, money changers, and silver houses competed to absorb. Soon, it soared by 80 yuan. Silver houses traded 20 taels with each other at 5,640 yuan. Later, as buyers decreased, securities firms suddenly sold, and cash houses also sold one after another. Before long, it was strongly suppressed by 100 yuan. Securities firms sold money changers 10 taels, falling back to 5,540 yuan. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange market remained soft and retail selling had subsided, coupled with the gold and silver houses competing to absorb, the price leaped by 130 yuan again.

A certain silver house sold securities firms 50 taels for 5,540 yuan. Then, as sellers gradually decreased and retail investors took the opportunity to buy at low prices, the market suddenly turned around and rose by 30 to 40 yuan. Later, a certain silver house strongly entered more than 200 taels, and the price exited the 5,600 yuan level. Silver houses traded 30 taels with each other for 5,625 yuan.

### The Foreign Currency Market Hesitates

Yesterday's foreign currency market showed a gradual consolidation trend. The British and American gold pounds also fluctuated, and eventually rose slightly by 1 yuan. The supply and demand of surplus British notes was still even, and the market price was stable. The US dollar notes initially rose to 17 yuan, but then retreated to 16 yuan and 6 jiao and a half, and finally to 16 yuan and 8 jiao, an increase of 2 jiao compared with the previous day. The supply of Hong Kong notes was strong, and the market price was slightly softer. The demand for Annam notes gradually increased, and the market price rose. There was no shortage of Japanese gold notes. The evening market fell back to 1 yuan and 8 fen. There was a slight need for Korean notes, and the market price rose slightly. The evening market was 9 jiao 4 fen and a half.

### Nanjing Bank Closes

There were rumors in the market about the instability of the Nanjing Commercial Savings Bank in this city. The bank closed yesterday. The Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee sent a circular to the clearing banks at 9:30 a.m., stating that the Nanjing Bank's clearing deposit balance on the 17th was insufficient to cover the amount payable. It has not been supplemented so far. According to the regulations, the bank's clearing relationship on the 17th has been revoked. All notes receivable and payable relating to the bank should be returned to each other. From today onwards, the clearing relationship will be temporarily suspended.

### World Silver Prices Plummet

London, 17th Cable: The recent silver market plummeted by 4.375 due to mass selling. The supply of far-month contracts was limited, so it was slightly less than 1.25. There were few buyers and few transactions. The market was flat. The market was still flat after closing. In addition, New York Cable: The American silver price for spot was slightly less than 0.25. The Indian silver suddenly fell by three rupees and three annas, all retreating to fifty-nine rupees and twelve annas. The market was soft and tired. A total of two hundred transaction orders were made.

### Securities - Domestic Debt Rises and Fluctuates - Most Foreign Stocks are Scalping

After falling for two days, the securities black market rose again. People in the market believe that the resolution of the European war may bring peace to China and Japan. This ideal speculation does not understand the true meaning of China's resistance against Japan. It is like a dream. In fact, the market price rebounded due to the recovery of Yichang, and the war was going smoothly. The market price may not soar immediately, but it is not easy to fall. Yesterday, the most sought-after stocks were Shuntai and No. 20. The rest were No. 11 and Lianyi covering shorts, but Lianyi sold again in the afternoon. Hongkang sold the most throughout the day. Yichang, Jiufeng, and No. 4 also sold. If there are no major changes in the future situation, the sluggish market should not change. Yesterday's market price improved by 2 jiao and a half to 4 jiao and a half. The total turnover was more than 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading: 60 shares of Bank of Communications were traded at a price of 65 yuan.

What is worth noting in yesterday's stock market at the Public Chamber of Commerce is Jardine Matheson shares. When the market opened on Monday, it was priced at 30 yuan, and yesterday's highest price reached 39.25 yuan. The final price was 30 yuan. The ups and downs of British Union shares were also extreme. Although the profit prospects of rubber shares are very good (probably from 30% to 50%), the price reaction is still based on all the huge transactions on Monday and Tuesday, and it is not known how many of them are genuine investment transactions and how many are "scalping" transactions.

London, 17th (Week 10) Cable: Today's listed market price of Chinese foreign debt is still stable. There were no changes in the upper and lower bonds.

London, 17th (Monday) Cable: Today's listed market price of British Far East company stocks is still stable. Only Gulagram Rubber shares fell by 7.5 pence to 15 shillings. There were bids but no offers, and the rest were unchanged.

### Food - After the Rice Price Shockingly High - Yesterday it Fell Slightly by 1-2 Yuan

The rice market has been constantly changing recently. The magnitude of the fluctuations often exceeds people's expectations. This rise was particularly drastic. The black market price of japonica rice actually reached 70 yuan, and the price of foreign rice reached 60 yuan. In half a month, it suddenly rose by more than 10 yuan. This is truly unprecedented. When the market opened yesterday morning, not only was the route blocked, but most people stood by and watched. The sellers seemed to feel the pain of being unable to sell. This was due to the price being too high and the price of rice in the mainland being flat. Transportation was no longer profitable. At the same time, it was close to the price of foreign rice. The order volume was very large, and a large number of goods would flood in soon. The general speculators' rumors were self-defeating and lost their support. Zhejiang, Ningbo, and Shaoxing groups directly ordered foreign rice. With these relationships, they urgently sought to sell. The general trend was over, and it was difficult to save people's hearts. No matter how much you shouted, most people turned a deaf ear. It went all the way down, with a slight turn at the end. The market quotation for foreign rice, Saigon No. 1, was 56.5 yuan, Huowen 56 yuan, Xiaojiao 54 yuan, Tokyo Yangjian 54.5-54 yuan, mixed broken 50 yuan, 48-49 yuan, and rice tea 51 yuan. Statistics show that the prices of each were sharply lower by about 2 yuan compared to the market price on the morning of the previous day. In the afternoon, the Vietnam issue once rebounded, but in the end, due to the lack of actual sales, the floating households continued to sell. The market price rose and fell again, and the result was another decline of 2 to 3 jiao in the afternoon closing price. New transactions have not been finalized, and it is feared that they will be blocked, so no orders have been placed, and the return of goods is also less than 1 yuan. Saigon No. 2 in late June and early July initially opened at 62.5 yuan, then to 63 yuan. The same number 2 of Roma rice was at 62.5 yuan, a total of more than 200 tons of transactions. There are currently fewer than 6,000 bags of foreign rice.

A large batch of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It was transported from Hong Kong by the Yihua Shipping Company's Pangshenglun, totaling 20,752 bags. It was docked at the Roosevelt Wharf in the French Concession to unload. It is heard that 3,000 bags will be transported to Fujian today.

Although the arrival of thick and thin japonica rice was still limited, only over a thousand bags, it was rumored that someone saw that Shanghai rice was expensive and had great profits to be made, so they planned to search for a large amount in the producing area and transport it to Shanghai. The gate price fell sharply by 2 yuan accordingly. Changbang special clean japonica rice was 66-67 yuan, Su Kun Changzhou white japonica rice was 65-66 yuan, Qingsi special thin was 66 yuan, and Nangang rate rice was as high as 64.5 yuan, then down to 62.5 yuan.

### Flour Sales in Southeast Asia

Yesterday, the market for No. 2 flour was unchanged. Due to the high price of rice everywhere, the need for flour has increased unabated. In terms of customer sales, new transactions from Southeast Asian customers were also frequent. The customer price for brands such as Tianzhu was 16.25 yuan, but the price of returned goods was slightly different due to competitive relations. It is estimated that the total number of flour transactions in the market was more than 20,000 bags. The supply and demand of old car brand returned goods and miscellaneous brands of flour from the mainland were both silent, and there was no formal market. There was also no formal market for wheat. Today, 35,000 bags of flour will be transported to Guangdong and 1,500 bags to Hong Kong.

In addition, 1,010 bags of beans will be transported to Hong Kong, 150 bags to Singapore, 4,000 pieces of bean cake to Fujian, 2,910 pieces to Hong Kong, and 200 bags of sesame to Hong Kong.

### Yarn and Cotton - Rumors are Bearish - Cotton Yarn Falls

The yarn market is weakening, and the downward trend has started again. This is because France's order to Germany not to cease fire has been interpreted as a sign of peace. As a result, people's hearts have become weaker again. At the same time, the overseas cotton market is also trending downward, so the selling pressure is slightly heavier, and the market has fallen again. However, the purchase of 10-count coarse yarn in the South China region is still ongoing, which is very beneficial.

The spot yarn market opened in the morning. Because the market was tight and prices were high on the previous day, many people shouted high prices. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,200 yuan, and 10 bags were traded. Among them, there may be improprieties. A double room was 1,175 yuan, and it fell straight to 1,140 yuan. Then, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate was loose and then tight, and it rose to 1,165 yuan again, but major investors still had no intention of taking positions. The market is falling again, and there are many rumors, mostly in favor of the shorts. The closing price was 1,146 yuan. It is found that the total transaction volume in half a day was 1,763 bags, and the 20-count Double Horse fell by 23 yuan. Today, 525 pieces of yarn will be transported to Hong Kong, 1,285 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 90 pieces to Haimen, and 40 pieces to Haiphong. The amount of yarn bought by various guilds is listed on the left.

### American and Indian Cotton Fall Back - Local Cotton Transactions are Quiet

Local cotton transactions are as calm as ever. This is because there are no new developments in the yarn market. It is said that American cotton has fallen again by more than 20 pounds, and Indian cotton is also lifeless. Therefore, the factories' buying is very slow, and the market is not very excited. However, occasional business is all because the Indian cotton market is quite weak.

Another message: New York cotton market: At the beginning of the morning, the market opened and fell due to speculators selling. Later, due to the news from France and the closing of some bulls, the closing price was 20 pounds lower than the previous day. The Indian cotton market fell by four rupees yesterday along with the forecast.

The Shanghai foreign cotton transaction has gradually improved recently, but the number of transactions is not large. The industry's concerns are quite firm. The general opinion is that cotton prices have gradually turned around.

### Piece Goods - Increased Sales of Cloth in Guerrilla Areas

The cloth market rebounded after the fall, which is due to the good prospects of the cloth price. Fellow traders and Ronghu gradually started buying, and the actual digestion also increased. Goods such as Fushi fine twill and Zhenzhong fine cloth were 2.5 to 5 jiao higher per piece than the previous day. The market for the rest of the goods was stable, only the sales of summer cloth were sluggish, and the selling price was lower. Recently, the needs of guerrilla areas such as Hangzhou, Danghu, and Dinghai have increased suddenly. It is heard that most of them are transferred to the mainland. Yesterday, 200 pieces of white goods, bleached and dyed cloths were traded on this street, nearly 100 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth were traded by the Zhejiang and Anhui guilds, 140 to 150 pieces of colored cloth, woolen cloth, and printed cloth were traded by the Beilu Yanjin guild, and 50 to 60 bales of New Twill and coarse cloth were traded by the Hong Kong guild.

Dongbu's biggest rise at noon returned, Longtou fine cloth was seen higher than 35.5 yuan but ended up falling due to ordinary actual sales. The subsequent market fell to 34.9 yuan. 400 to 500 pieces of spot and forward fine cloth were traded by the local street and Northern guilds.

170 pieces of piece goods were transported to Tianjin on the 19th, 272 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 91 pieces to Haiphong, 80 pieces to Haikou, and 15 pieces to Singapore.

### Sales of Xiacuxi Wool are Strong - 150 Yuan Per Suit

Since the prevalence of Xiacuxi wool in 1927, its sales have been even more popular this summer, and its orders are also more than other woolens. Most of the wholesalers have samples. Many of the high-end wholesalers also sell it. High-end wholesalers mostly sell 7-8 yuan per yard of Donghuo, and wholesale cargo mostly sells 20 yuan per yard of American goods. The quality of American goods is good and the price is high. The Western clothing merchants buy and cut it after the guests designate it. The price of Donghuo is cheap, and ordinary business is more prosperous. The colors are pure white, light yellow, dark yellow, cyan gray, light lilac, etc. The actual sales of yellow-gray and white are the most popular. This kind of clothing material is only 40 inches wide. Therefore, a suit of Xiacuxi wool that sells for more than 20 yuan per yard costs about 150 yuan in legal tender.

### Sugar Market - Coarse and White Sugar Continue to Loosen

Yesterday's sugar market continued to decline due to excessive sales by scattered households. The guild's price, the spot price of 24 coarse white sugar was 70.3 yuan to 70 yuan per bag at the local warehouse, 70 yuan to 69.8 yuan per bag at the foreign warehouse, and 55.6 yuan to 55.4 yuan for re-exported goods in the morning, and 55.2 yuan to 55 yuan in the afternoon. One yuan less. Taikoo B Mark new cargo was 81.5 yuan, and 5 jiao less. The price of H Mark Red was 58 yuan, and the price of Dutch Red was still 59.6 yuan. The price of the local factory's snow white was 70.5 yuan, No. 1 ice was 91.5 yuan, and Jingming ice was 93 yuan. Liu Sugar only opened 50 to 60 bags of Diaoging (transported by Taikoo), which was still 63.5 yuan. In addition, the asking price for chemical sugar was too high, and there were no transactions.

### Silk and Tea - Inland Transportation is Blocked - Silk Prices Rise

Yesterday's silk market did not see much glory or disgrace abroad. The recent rise in New York was half a point, and the far-month drop was three points. Yokohama's spot market was 20 yuan less, and this period was 16 yuan less. Due to the temporary inability to transport to Shanghai in the mainland, silk prices rose. Due to replenishment transactions in Renji and other firms, the asking price for spot white factory has risen to 5,200 yuan, but the spot market in Shanghai is limited, resulting in very few transactions. The market situation is very firm.

### North and South Goods - Red Dates Suddenly Rise by 9 Yuan

Due to the recent shortage of dates, the market has suddenly tightened. It was found that the previous market opened at 26 yuan, and yesterday a few dozen bags opened as high as 36 yuan in cash, an increase of as much as 9 yuan. This shows the scarcity.

### Hardware - Cement Market is Firm

The spot cement circulating on the market recently feels rather scarce. Although the building groups on this street do not see much use, cement still has a feeling of demand exceeding supply. The reason is that the source of cement is blocked and it is a military necessity. Transportation to Shanghai is difficult. Those who trade this commodity are eager to keep prices high and are unwilling to sell at low prices. Therefore, the current market is still firm. If white cement sells for 105 yuan per barrel, Matou is 55 yuan, and bagged goods are asking for 16 yuan per bag, which is no different from the golden age of the previous market.

### Miscellaneous Wenzhou Boxboard and Native Paper Arrive

Since the supply of sanitary paper and rough (raw) paper from Fuyang has become difficult, it has been replaced by Wenzhou's Size 46 screen paper, which is sold on the market and has a wide reach. This paper was originally only used for making paper money in various northern regions, but now there is an additional source of income. Yesterday, 7,000 pieces were shipped from Wenzhou. Boxboard is also mostly from Wenzhou, and has often soared in price due to supply disruptions. Yesterday, 7,000 pieces were also shipped from Wenzhou. (Group)

### French Armistice Does Not Affect the Shanghai Situation Many Rumors Have No Factual Proof Consul General Eugene Makes a Firm Statement

The status of the Shanghai concessions is subject to unavoidable influences and fluctuations whenever international situations change, due to its intricate and complex international relations, causing unnecessary anxiety and the spread of rumors. However, the actual situation is often not as such. Since the news of the French armistice reached Shanghai yesterday, it has inevitably shocked the world. In fact, all the rumors are baseless and unreliable. It is difficult to predict how the European situation will evolve in the short term. As for the Far East, it is true that Japan's ambitions have become more intense due to the sudden changes in the European situation. However, the international relations in the South Pacific are extremely complex, and Japan may not act rashly without considering everything. As for the Shanghai concessions, there will be no changes in the near future. The details are as follows:

Japanese Military Exercises Not Surprising

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reported that after the news of France's surrender to Germany, Japanese military police and tanks conducted exercises in the Nanshi (Chinese) area last night (17th) and this morning (18th). Rumors that 3,000 Wang Jingwei's soldiers had arrived in Shanghai caused anxiety among foreign and Chinese business circles in the city. The Chamber of Commerce showed a peculiar reaction today. The market opened firm, rising slightly, then falling back, and then rising again. It is believed that this was due to the rumor that the Wang regime would issue new currency within a few days.

French Consul General Makes a Solemn Statement

French Consul General Eugene told reporters this morning that the current status of the French Concession in Shanghai will continue to be maintained. Regarding the various rumors circulating this morning, Eugene dismissed them as unfounded rumors, saying, "As long as we are alive, we must work. We are not sad. All affairs in the French Concession, including the police, will continue as before. Let the rumors fly; we will not be moved by them. We are still standing on the land, not sleeping in it."

Various Rumors Unconfirmed

Regarding the Japanese military police and tank exercises in Nanshi, no explanation was given today. Several people witnessed the exercises, but the city authorities could not explain them. It is believed that these exercises are the same as those previously held in Hongkou and are now being held in Nanshi for some special reason. The rumor that 3,000 Wang Jingwei's soldiers had arrived in Shanghai and were gathering around the city could not be fully confirmed.

US Marines Return to Shanghai

In addition, 200 US Fourth Marine Regiment soldiers stationed in Shanghai returned to Shanghai yesterday aboard the US ship "Bittern" after completing training in Qinhuangdao. It is said that these soldiers were ordered to return to Shanghai after Italy declared war to strengthen the US military presence in Shanghai.

Japanese Spokesman's Statement

A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai told Western reporters that France's submission to the German army would not cause the Japanese authorities to take drastic changes to the situation in the city. Japan's policy of non-intervention in the European war does not consider controlling the British and French concessions, unless the two concessions "disturb the peace" or "hinder Japan's plan to build a new order in East Asia." Japan has previously made many demands on the two concessions, some of which have not been met. But at present, the relationship between the concession authorities and Japanese military officers is quite friendly. Regarding the presence of troops from belligerent countries in the concession, the spokesman said that Mayor Fu's request for the withdrawal of these troops was very reasonable according to international law, and that the existence of these troops could easily cause "unintentional incidents" and force Japan to take action to maintain "peace" and "order." He also said that the Japanese authorities pay close attention to various Chinese and English newspapers in the city, and that the Japanese authorities are very dissatisfied with some of them and are closely monitoring them. The spokesman also said that Japan is engaged in a large-scale war, and the natural desires of the Japanese people must be satisfied. Foreigners who oppose Japan's actions do not understand the facts. However, Japan does not want to take advantage of the changes in Europe to obtain the interests of foreigners in China. The Japanese slogan is "non-intervention in the European war." The Japanese believe that Europe belongs to the Europeans, America belongs to the Americans, and the East belongs to the Easterners. The spokesman concluded by saying that the Japanese did not view France's submission as surprising, as they had long anticipated this day. The Japanese knew about the weapons used by the German army because they had close contact with them.

Peaceful Situation in Western Shanghai

Yesterday, there were also rumors that Japanese military police had joined the "Great Way Police Department" in the extra-settlement roads area around the French Concession to strengthen their strength. A reporter toured the extra-settlement roads area for a week yesterday afternoon and proved that the rumors were not true. Japanese military police could only be seen in the "Shanghai Municipal Government." During the reporter's tour, he only saw a Japanese military officer leading several "Great Way Police" officers patrolling the road on Haig Road. Nothing else was seen.

Financial Markets Relatively Stable

Yesterday, the markets were inevitably stimulated by the many rumors, but were generally stable. Speculators were also cautious and did not dare to act rashly. Although the price of the British pound fell sharply at one point yesterday morning due to news from Europe, it quickly rebounded due to limited supply and purchases by Japanese banks. The British pound opened at $3.60 and closed at $3.65. However, the French franc has been completely suspended since it effectively stopped trading last Friday. The exchange rate posted by HSBC remained unchanged. The black market was tight for British pounds and US dollars. In addition, there was little activity in the gold standard, yarn, and miscellaneous grain markets, indicating stability.

### Inability to Advance South Due to the Situation

After the sudden turn of events in the European war, the situation in the Pacific suddenly became tense. It is reported that Vice Admiral Tanaka, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet in China, recently inspected Hainan Island. He reviewed the troops stationed in the northern part of Hainan Island and the situation on the front lines a few days ago. In fact, he had another special mission related to Japan's southward advance policy. Not long ago, people in Tokyo observed that if France makes peace, Japan's policy toward French Indochina will become more active.

Serious Attention to Japan's Actions

According to an observation by a senior British diplomatic official, Japan does have this intention, but is hesitant because it fears the firm attitude of the United States. At the same time, American observers stated that the US authorities are extremely determined to maintain the status quo in the Pacific, as evidenced by measures such as permanently concentrating the fleet in Honolulu and not participating in the European war. The US authorities are closely monitoring Japan's actions. If Japan takes action in the South Pacific, the United States will not only force Japan to submit through economic sanctions, but also use its huge air power to crush the island nation.

American Air Force's Tremendous Power

According to recent statistics, the United States has as many as 8,500 fighter jets, and its air bases are located from the Arctic to the tropics. Even in terms of civilian airline pilots, the number has increased to 10,000 in one year. At the same time, it has 39 "Flying Fortresses," and will have 175 in June 1941. Although the number is small, no country in the world can compete with the United States. This type of "Flying Fortress" can fly 3,200 miles round trip. The US Air Force stationed in Honolulu can fly to Tokyo, bomb it, and return directly to its base, or fly from the Atlantic base to bomb Saarbrücken, Germany, without any difficulty. The power of the American air force is evident from this.

### Please Assist All Industries: Disaster Relief in Shaoxing Area, Industry Associations Suggest Unified Relief Efforts in Ningbo and Shaoxing

Since the Ningbo and Shaoxing native place associations separately organized fundraising committees, they have begun raising funds and purchasing large quantities of foreign rice to transport for relief. Various industry associations have also mobilized fundraising to relieve the famine in Ningbo and Shaoxing. According to the New Voice News Agency, various industry associations, considering that the individual fundraising efforts of the Ningbo and Shaoxing native place associations are relatively weak, suggest joint action for greater effectiveness. They have suggested that the two native place associations unify their operations and provide widespread relief.

Expand Fundraising

The Shaoxing natives in Shanghai association has specially distributed letters to various industry associations in the city, stating that the rice shortage is severe, with each stone rising to 120 yuan. People have exhausted chaff and bran, and are now tasting grass roots and tree bark. Children are being abandoned, and the roads are filled with corpses. In addition, the weather is extremely dry, and half of the farmland has not been planted. It is predicted that the autumn harvest will be much worse. They have launched an expanded fundraising campaign for price stabilization in Shaoxing to assist the price stabilization groups in various counties and seek relief for the entire Shaoxing rice supply. They implore people to remember the millions of hungry people in Shaoxing waiting to be fed and widely appeal for large donations so that those on the verge of death can be reborn. The association has now decided that once the donated funds have reached a certain amount, it will purchase rice for price stabilization in the areas where it is most urgently needed. They hope that various native place associations will actively contribute.

Meeting and Consultation

Since the Ningbo natives in Shanghai association initiated fundraising for the rice shortage in their hometown, fellow villagers from various industries have actively contributed. The metal industry villagers have contributed the most, reaching more than 80,000 yuan. Other industries are also very enthusiastic and often exceed the expected amount after the fundraising campaign is launched. The association has scheduled a general meeting on the 22nd of this month to discuss various relief efforts and issued notices to various industry associations yesterday.

Disaster Situation Continued Report

The Ningbo natives in Shanghai association received a letter yesterday from the heads of various villages in the Dongqian Lake area of Yin County, stating that the residents of the Dongqian Lake area of Yin County have traditionally made a living by fishing. Recently, the lake has dried up, and fishing boats are stranded in the lake and cannot sail out to sea. They are helpless. At this time of severe rice shortage, people are starving to death every day. Please provide relief quickly. In addition, the mountain area of Yinjiang Bridge in Yin County has no water and does not produce grain. It has been planting fritillaria bulbs. Since the rice shortage, grain has not been supplied, and the supply has been cut off for ten days. The residents are crying out in hunger, and corpses are lying all over the road, which is unbearable to witness. They have also requested the association to find ways to provide relief.

### Letters to Europe Returned in Batches Due to Fighting in Delivery Areas, European Liners Scheduled to Depart Regularly

According to news from the Postal Administration, since the outbreak of war in Europe, many letters from this port to various European countries have been undeliverable due to fighting in the delivery areas. Several batches have now been returned to Shanghai. The areas where delivery is impossible are mostly the Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, and Germany. The main types of mail are letters.

According to the reporters of Pingming News Agency, the liners departing from this port to various European countries this month are: the Teheran of the British Company after the 20th, the Precious Tree Cloud of the Royal Company after the 24th, the President Coolidge of the United States after the 27th, and the French postal ship Felix Roussel at the end of the month.

### Crackdown on Rice Adulteration, Hoarders Sold Off Yesterday, Rice Prices Fell

Amidst the soaring rice prices, some unscrupulous rice merchants are actually adulterating high-quality rice with inferior goods for sale, deceiving citizens and disregarding commercial ethics. Although the authorities have repeatedly issued notices and strictly cracked down, they have achieved considerable results for a time. Today, as rice prices continue to reach new highs and food panic has not been eliminated, some speculative rice merchants have once again come up with the idea of resuming rice adulteration. The authorities have made up their minds to take action and are closely monitoring the situation. Once verified, they will be severely punished to deter others and assist in the crackdown. Yesterday, the rice market saw a drop in prices due to speculators’ reckless price increases in recent days, with each stone of rice reaching as high as 60 yuan, causing buyers to hesitate. Hoarders, seeing the potential for profit, competed to sell off their stocks. In addition to the large quantities of Saigon foreign rice arriving in Shanghai in recent days, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has also been transporting thousands of stones of domestic rice every day. Farmers in the suburbs have also been carrying and transporting rice to the city for sale, amounting to about 3,000 stones per day. Yesterday, foreign rice and domestic rice both fell by about one yuan. However, some speculators are still trying to stir up trouble.

### Land Bureau Archives and Maps, Consular Body Refuses to Hand Over, Should Be Returned to the Legitimate Chinese Government, Fu Xiaoan Threatens to Declare Invalid

The English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" reported that this morning (the 18th), it was heard from reliable sources that the Shanghai Consular Body is divided on the issue of handing over 312 boxes of archives and maps of the Shanghai Municipal Government Land Bureau to "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan. Several consuls in Shanghai oppose handing over the archives because they believe the time is not yet ripe. According to their consular officials, Fu must still show his willingness to cooperate with the authorities of the Public Concession. For example, an agreement on the issue of roads outside the boundary has not yet reached a preliminary solution, that is, the establishment of the Western District Joint Police Force. As for the Public Concession Bureau, which currently holds the archives, it has not yet formally received notice of the disagreement among the consuls. The Public Concession Bureau asked the consular office at the beginning of this year for instructions on what action to take. Some consuls ordered the Public Concession Bureau to keep the archives until a more favorable time. However, the consular office, in the name of the whole, notified the Public Concession Bureau that the bureau had not consulted the Consular Body when it took over the archives, so the bureau must resolve the matter itself. Fu Xiaoan told reporters that he was unwilling to wait long beyond the time necessary for the Public Concession Bureau to decide to hand over the archives. If they are not handed over in the short term, he may declare the archives and maps invalid, and the boundary stones in areas outside the Concession may be removed. Regarding the negotiations on roads outside the boundary, Fu said that it is now his turn to give a final answer to the proposal made by Major Bowen, Chief of the Public Concession Bureau's police department, three weeks ago. However, the Public Concession Bureau's attitude towards the archives shows that the bureau is not eager to find a solution to the problem of roads outside the boundary.

### Avenue Haig, Name Seems Likely to Be Removed, Currently a "Nameless Road", Future Naming to Be Decided by Authorities

According to the French-language "Journal de Shanghai," the road sign for Avenue Haig in the French Concession was suddenly removed in the middle of the night last Friday (the 14th). The road is now nameless. According to French custom, roads named after people are mostly to reward those who have served France, regardless of whether they are alive or dead, to express respect. This time, Italy declared war on France, and the French Concession still has the road name of its king, which is quite offensive. Therefore, it is best to remove it. As for the future naming of this nameless road, it will be up to the municipal authorities.

There are many precedents for road name changes

During the European War in 1914, there was also a road in the French Concession named Route Zikron, in memory of a famous German doctor. After the outbreak of the war, the road sign was suddenly taken away one night, and the road name was privately changed to Avenue Joffre. Later, Route Zikron was renamed Avenue Albert, and Baoshang Road was renamed Avenue Joffre. As for the person who removed the road sign of Baolong Road, he soon returned to his country to participate in the war and was killed in battle. The French Concession authorities, in memory of him, named the road after his name, which is now Wenlin Road.

### Japanese Organizations Request That the Public Concession Bureau Use Japanese in Documents

According to Japanese sources yesterday, Japanese organizations in this port are now requesting that the Public Concession Bureau use both English and Japanese in all official documents. This request will be raised by the Japanese director of the Public Concession Bureau to the authorities. Japanese people will soon organize a taxpayer association to negotiate this matter directly with the Public Concession Bureau.

### Nanjing Commercial Savings Bank Suddenly Closes, Limited Scope, No Impact, Some Small Private Banks Also Fail

The Shanghai branch of the Nanjing Commercial Savings Bank, located at the corner of Jiujiang Road and Sichuan Road, has been established for nearly a year. Yesterday morning, for some unknown reason, it suddenly stopped operating, tightly closing its doors, preventing those who went to withdraw money from obtaining it. Only a notice from the miscellaneous staff was posted on the bank's door, stating, "The Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Branch of this bank and the heads of various departments did not arrive at the bank during business hours today (June 18), causing the vault door to be locked and no one to open it. No one is responsible for business affairs, resulting in the suspension of business. In addition to reporting to the Board of Directors and the General Manager for instructions on how to handle the situation, we hereby request lawyers to notify the Shanghai Branch Manager, Deputy Manager, and department heads of this bank to come to the bank immediately to hand over account books, documents, important documents, and to cooperate with accountant Xi Yushu to liquidate the accounts," etc. In general, depositors were greatly alarmed by the bank's sudden closure, which made it impossible to withdraw money.

In the past two weeks, the price of gold has fluctuated greatly, and many who speculated in gold have lost money. According to reporters from Daguan News Agency, who investigated the industry, about ten silver shops and small private banks have failed. Most of them are newly established and have not joined the Money Exchange Association. However, they are reluctant to talk about the failures and are very secretive, unwilling to announce it to the outside world. It is said that the losses from this failure are only between 10,000 and 20,000 yuan, up to 60,000 or 70,000 yuan at most.

### Norwegian Consul General in Shanghai Vows Loyalty to the Norwegian King, Denounces Quisling's Puppet Government, Norwegian Consular Jurisdiction Never Threatened

The "North-China Daily News" reported that Norwegian Consul General in Shanghai and Consul General to the United Kingdom, Mr. Kruge, stated yesterday (June 17) that he resolutely pledges allegiance to the King of Norway and the Norwegian government in London and denounces Quisling as the most despicable Norwegian. According to Mr. Kruge, after the German army invaded Norway, it sent Quisling to organize a short-lived puppet government. At that time, he received a telegram from the Quisling government ordering him to obey orders, but he did not respond to this telegram. Any power established in Norway by the Germans is merely a puppet and has not been approved by the King of Norway. A few days after receiving this telegram, the Quisling government ceased its activities. Norwegians are now determined to obey the only qualified Norwegian government, as in the past. The government is currently with the King of Norway and the Crown Prince in London. When Norway was about to be invaded, Norwegian expatriates here were busy, and after the German army occupied Norway, the Norwegian expatriates were quite anxious, eagerly awaiting news from Europe and their homeland. He will handle many complex issues that need attention, especially the affairs of Norwegian merchants and shipping here. The work is quite laborious. Norwegian ships still fly the Norwegian flag, but they have stopped sailing to Norwegian ports. He received and followed the orders issued by the Norwegian Shipping Committee, which is currently in London. Since the outbreak of war in Europe, Norwegian consular jurisdiction in China has not been threatened. The rumor that a certain party exerted pressure to force Norwegians to give up their consular jurisdiction in China is not true. Since Norway was drawn into the war, the personnel of the Norwegian Consular Office in this city have been working as usual, handling several cases under its jurisdiction. Mr. Kruge concluded by expressing his unwavering belief that Norway will eventually obtain justice, and said that the only legitimate government of Norway is now with the King of Norway and the Crown Prince in London.

### French Vice Consul Supervised Relief in the Nanshi Refugee Area, Whether to End the Charitable Lottery, No Decision Has Been Made

After Father Jacquinot left Shanghai, the Nanshi Refugee Area was discussed by the Relief Committee and office staff. It was decided to end it at the end of this month. Young and strong refugees will be given half a month's rations and scattered. The old, weak, and disabled will be transferred to the Puyu Hall for accommodation. Before leaving, Father Jacquinot entrusted the follow-up matters in the district to the French Vice Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Esparbès, to preside over. Mr. Esparbès is also a member of the Refugee Area Supervisory Committee. Therefore, Mr. Esparbès is supervising the staff to actively handle various follow-up matters. As for whether the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry Charitable Lottery will cease publication with the end of the Refugee Area, nothing has been heard yet. The lottery has been issued for twenty issues, and its twenty-first issue is scheduled to be drawn on the 21st of this month.

### Water and Electricity in the French Concession Rumored to Be Increasing Prices Again, Submitted to the Public Works Bureau, Rumored to Be Inevitable

According to Dazhong News Agency, water and electricity in the French Concession will increase prices again in the near future. It is said that the water and electricity company has submitted this request to the Public Works Bureau. The Public Works Bureau has handed it over to the Board of Directors for research because the matter is important and will conduct a careful audit of the company's business situation, income and expenditure, and the relationship between the water and electricity company and the Public Works Bureau, and then decide whether to approve it or not. However, it is rumored that the price increase is inevitable and may be approved by the Board of Directors. If so, the citizens of the French Concession will really be unable to bear it, which is something that should be noted.

### Stalls on Seymour Road Vegetable Market Have Insufficient Scales, Fines and Confiscation of Weighing Instruments

The following stallholders in the Seymour Road Vegetable Market were fined and punished separately by the court on the 14th of this month after the Public Works Bureau found that the weight of the goods sold was insufficient:

### The Dredging Bureau's Decision to Expand Dredging Will Take Effect on July 1, The Fuxing Is Trying to Sail to Shanghai

Since the Dredging Bureau was forced to reorganize, small-scale dredging has begun, but only a few thousand cubic meters of mud are dredged every day. The autumn floods are coming soon, and dredging is urgent. It has been decided to start a larger-scale dredging project on July 1. Regarding the haibao dredging boats participating in the dredging, the ropes, paints, yarn heads, climbing roots, machine oil, fuel oil, hardware, mild steel bars, mild steel plates, tools, and miscellaneous materials required by the measuring boats from July 1 to December 31 for six months were publicly tendered yesterday. In addition, the bureau considered that the dredging project was arduous, and the sister dredging boat of the Jianshe, the Fuxing, which was stranded in the Danzig shipyard, was also trying to sail to Shanghai to participate in the work. However, it is difficult to predict whether it can come to Shanghai due to the intense European war.

### Zhejiang Customs Seized Another Batch of French Currency Smuggled to Sea, All Confiscated After Being Seized

Zhejiang Customs has been very strict in inspecting French currency smuggled to sea. Recently, it was found that it was not easy to smuggle by ship, so fishing boats were used to smuggle. Zhejiang Customs seized two ice-carrying boats and seized 15,000 yuan of French currency. On the 16th, it was reported that an ice-carrying boat from Jintang, boat number Ji Zi 2555, was carrying 45,000 French currency to sea, starting from Shanghai. The ice-carrying boat was found to be sailing from Yongkai Town, and 2,000 yuan of French currency was seized by the customs and confiscated according to regulations.

### Few Sources of Miscellaneous Taxes and Dues, Insufficient Pork Supply

Pork in Shanghai is becoming increasingly scarce and prices are rising daily. According to meat merchants, at present, in Nantong, such as Xingang, Qingang, etc., all pig boats passing through the river must wait for a certain navy to levy so-called "donations" before issuing a pass, and then they can pass. Therefore, in general, pig merchants have little profit to make due to the heavy exploitation on land and water, and they do not come out. This is a major reason. Therefore, for a week, the average number of pigs arriving in Shanghai every day is only about 1,500, while the two concessions need 3,000 to be able to cope with the situation.

### Public Works Bureau Organizes Rickshaw Group Meeting

The Public Works Bureau, in view of the difficulty in maintaining the public rickshaw industry due to the soaring prices of various materials for the car body, and the economic difficulties of the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid association, has repeatedly requested relief. Therefore, it has organized a special group committee to conduct a general study of the current situation of the rickshaw industry in this port. The committee members include Harris, Xi Yushu, He Dekui (deputy general manager of the bureau), Ms. Xing De (director of the industrial section), and rickshaw managers. It is learned that before the bureau implements the investigation by the above-mentioned group committee, it has decided on temporary relief measures, that is, from the 20th of this month, the public rickshaw fare will be allowed to increase by 15 cents per car per day, and from July, the subsidy to the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid association will be increased by 50 cents per car per month.

### News Roundup

Stallholders Request: The stallholders in the Baxianqiao small vegetable market in the French Concession were greatly panicked when they learned about the reorganization. They all said that at this extraordinary time, life is difficult. If they move their stalls, it will inevitably affect their business and be of great importance. Therefore, in addition to writing to the French Consul General to consider the difficulties of the business and withdraw the order to avoid moving the stalls in order to maintain business, they also designated Sun Jingyuan, Zhu Changsheng, and more than ten others as stallholder representatives to request assistance from various French groups and Chinese directors.

Prohibit Buying Pawn Tickets: The Public Concession Bureau of the Public Concession has added a strict prohibition on the trade of buying and selling pawn tickets due to many malpractices. It is now heard that the French Consul General has also ordered a strict prohibition on residents of the French Concession from engaging in the trade of buying and selling pawn tickets in order to eliminate malpractices. It is said that the French Public Works Bureau and the French Police Department have received this order and are implementing it separately within their respective scopes of authority.

Fill in the Certificate Form in Detail: The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to various related industry associations, such as cotton cloth dyeing and weaving, yesterday, stating that all the items that should be filled in on the six-part national product certificate form issued by the association should be filled in item by item, without omission. Recently, it was found that the application forms filled in by various factories and shops only filled in the destination but not the receiving merchant, and some only filled in the general shore to the interior, such as the sesame stamp, but did not indicate where they were transferred to, and the date of application. All these situations are equivalent to pre-using the blank space, leaving it for the factories and shops to fill in at will in the future, which has serious malpractices. The association should strictly review when transferring, and if there is any omission, it should be rejected immediately. In addition, the application forms filled in by various factories and shops are often unclear. It is hoped that the subordinates will be notified to pay attention to the correction and carefully review them when transferring.

### Overseas Chinese in Germany Encounter Hardship, Embassy Provides Assistance, Poor Overseas Chinese Receive US$10 in Assistance, Most Have Abandoned Business Life

Since the European War, overseas Chinese, whether they are engaged in business or studying, have been affected by the war and cannot continue to work. In the past six months, countless people have returned to China one after another. According to the news from various travel groups that receive overseas Chinese returning to China, the number of overseas Chinese who have lost their jobs and schooling is the largest in France, Germany, and Italy. The rest of the countries, such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Belgium, are mostly students. After the war, many overseas Chinese in Germany and Italy transferred to France. Those overseas Chinese who have more savings have returned to China one after another. The remaining ones are mostly poor. It is said that they have been forced to abandon their business and are engaged in various wartime production jobs in various countries. In addition, there are a large number of overseas Chinese in Germany who are living in poverty due to unemployment and are no different from refugees. The Chinese Embassy in Germany, in order to relieve poor overseas Chinese, has recently processed the assistance of travel expenses to return to China, US$10 per person. However, due to the high cost of funding after the war and the need to transfer routes, those with a little strength can make up for it. Therefore, recently, many overseas Chinese in Germany have received assistance and transferred to Italy.

### Habitual Blackmailer, Rearrested for Extortion, and Forging Documents and Framing Indiscriminately, After Investigation, All Cases Were Detained and Prosecuted

Dai Xianfang from Ningbo and Sun Xinian from Shaoxing previously used intimidation to extort a huge sum of money from Wang Xianglin, the owner of Zengli Yarn Company at Room 108, Hartung Building, 233 Nanjing Road. Wang reported to the police, and the two were detained by the First Special Court and sentenced to six months in prison with a three-year reprieve. Dai and Sun were unrepentant after being released from prison. Recently, they colluded with Zhang Desheng, a former bounty hunter who had closed down, to discuss revenge methods. After discussion, they decided to take two steps. One was for Zhang to report to Shenxin No. 9 Yarn Factory that Wang Xianglin was replacing inferior goods with Shenxin brand, so that Shenxin could report to the police. The second was for Zhang to come forward and intimidate Wang Xianglin, accusing him of forging fake Consolidated Tax Bureau tax bills and ordering Wang to pay a huge sum of money. If Wang did not pay, Zhang would try to transport the forged tax bills into the Perry warehouse, so that Shenxin could report to the police and the police could search and find the fake bills and be subject to legal sanctions. After the discussion was finalized, Zhang first implemented his second method. On the 8th of this month, Zhang brought Wang Xianglin to the Guohua Opium Den on Heping Road and accused Wang of counterfeiting Shenxin products with inferior goods and forging tax bills, and asked Wang to pay 7,500 yuan to settle the matter, otherwise he would report it. Although Wang knew that Zhang and others were deliberately extorting money, he was afraid of their despicable methods. In order to settle the matter, he gave 1,000 yuan, but Zhang insisted on the original amount, which led to the breakdown of the negotiation. Zhang then implemented his first method and reported to Shenxin No. 9 Factory. The factory reported to the Jingansi Police Station, and Chief Detective Yao Yuanlong and Detective Ni Jiafeng went to arrest Wang Xianglin, manager Wang Zhengfu, and partner Wang Jianzhang. They seized 1,355 fake true tax bills from the Consolidated Tax Bureau. After investigation, it was learned that Zhang, Dai, Sun, and others had intimidated and extorted money and intended to frame them. The three were arrested again. They seized 387 forged tax bureau transportation documents, a tax bureau seal, and a zinc plate and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, this case was continued to be heard by Judge Liu Yugui in the Second Criminal Court. The three Wangs hired lawyers Qian Jia, Li Baosen, and Zhang Desheng hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend them. Police lawyer Li Zhishan filed a lawsuit against Zhang Desheng, Sun Xinian, and Dai Xianfang for intimidation and extortion under Article 346 of the Criminal Law and forgery under Article 211 of the same law, and sued Perry for receiving stolen goods under Article 349 of the Criminal Law, because the 1,355 tax bills stored in the Perry warehouse were considered stolen goods and received. After detailed questioning by Judge Liu, he ordered a one-week postponement for investigation and further hearing.

### Zhao Brothers and Sisters in Guangdong Sued for Inheritance, Each Party Holds Its Own View, Court Discusses Summoning Witnesses for Further Verification

Zhao Zuoheng (22 years old this year), a Guangdong native who graduated from the Eaton Aviation University in the United Kingdom, and Zhao Zuyi, Zhao Xiuxin, etc., who currently live at No. 60 Jing'an Villa, Jing'an Temple Road, are brothers and sisters. They are all grandsons and granddaughters of the late Zhao Zhuochen from Foshan, Guangdong. Zhao Zhuochen left a huge inheritance. In July 1933, he made a will to extract 70,000 yuan in national currency from the inheritance as education and marriage expenses for the eight brothers and sisters Zhao Zuoheng, Zuyi, Xiuxin, Zishuang, Bishuang, Zuxi, Zuyuan, and Shuxin. The funds were the responsibility of Ms. Li, the biological mother of Zhao Zuyi, etc., to keep, and she used the funds to purchase a piece of land and 52 houses on Xinjiang Road, receiving more than 1,000 yuan in rent per month. Recently, Zhao Zuoheng accused his brother Zhao Zuyi and others of seizing the inheritance and hired lawyer Ma Junshuo to file a complaint in the civil court of the First Special Court, accusing Zhao Zuyi of dereliction of duty.

He requested confirmation of the joint ownership of the land and houses in Tianxinli, Xinjiang Road, and in accordance with Zhao Zhuochen's will, four grandsons each received one share, and four granddaughters each received half a share, a total of six shares, and requested that Zhao Zuyi and others be ordered to distribute one-sixth to the plaintiff. The court heard the case yesterday. Defendant Zhao Zuyi and others entrusted lawyer Dan Yuhua to act as their agent and appeared in court to answer. It was said that the plaintiff Zhao Zuoheng had already withdrawn several thousand Hong Kong dollars in education expenses when he was practicing law in Hong Kong and had been married. There are still several unmarried defendants. The 70,000 yuan of national currency bequeathed by Zhao Zhuochen specified that the funds were for education and marriage, which is currently difficult to analyze. Therefore, he requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The court reviewed the statements and ordered a postponement to summon witnesses for further hearing.

### Impersonating Firefighters - Arrested for Fraud

Recently, within the Public Concession, individuals dressed in firefighter uniforms have been impersonating fire department personnel. They have been coercively selling fire extinguishers to households at exorbitant prices, seizing the opportunity to extort money. The police department has received numerous reports and has ordered a strict and thorough investigation. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 17th) at 12:45 PM, two individuals, Huang Gongxia (30 years old, residing at No. 18 Li'an Lane, Xigong Road) and Shi Mingren (25 years old), dressed in firefighter uniforms and carrying fire extinguishers, went to the residence of Zhang Haiquan on Huishan Road. They claimed to be sent by the fire department to install fire extinguishers, demanding a high price. Huang later stated that if Zhang contributed funds, the installation could be waived. Zhang, sensing something amiss, reported it to the police, who apprehended Huang and Shi. It was discovered that they were impersonators. The police department, recognizing Huang and his accomplice's history of repeated offenses, earnestly encourages victims to come forward and press charges to deter such troublemakers.

### Factory Owner Abuses His Wife

Qiu Gengtang, a native of Ningbo and the 25-year-old owner of Hengchang Machinery Factory on Zhoujiazui Road in Hongkou, married Xu Zhitian (currently 27 years old), also a native of Ningbo, ten years ago. They have had five children together, two of whom have passed away. However, in the first month of this year, Qiu became involved with a hostess named Tu Lili from the Family Guidance Association, which drastically changed his behavior. He began to abuse Xu frequently and neglected his younger brother, Fu Tang, who was bedridden in the hospital with tuberculosis. Xu repeatedly wanted to sue Qiu, but she was dissuaded by relatives and friends. Last night, a conflict erupted between Qiu and his wife again, and Qiu severely beat her, causing injuries. Xu, extremely angry, reported the incident to the Huishan Police Station. Detectives were dispatched to arrest him, but Qiu had already fled without a trace. In addition to seeking legal recourse, the police are actively investigating Qiu's whereabouts to bring him to justice.

### Dissected Female Corpse Case Takes an Unexpected Turn - Teacher Accuses Principal - Shen Weiwei Arrested After Investigation

Huang Jinxiu, a woman from Pudong residing at No. 15, Lane 40, Zhoujiapai Road, Yangshupu, went to work at the Japanese-owned Shanghai Cotton Mill on Yangshupu Road on the morning of the 10th of this month. She did not return that night and was found to have been raped and murdered, her body divided into six sections and discarded in the wilderness. After the Chinese and foreign detectives of the Yangshupu Police Station recovered Huang's

dissected body in the wasteland of Meizhou Road, Zhoujiapai Road, Hangzhou Road, Yangshupu Xihu Road and other places, they arrested four suspects from Changzhou: Sheng Hongsheng, Wu Cheng, Gu Licai, and Ding Jifa from Ningbo. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. All details have been reported in this newspaper. During the adjourned hearing, it was determined that Wu and Gu were not involved, and they were released. Sheng and Ding were detained. Unexpectedly, Shen Weiwei (22 years old), a native of Chongming and a teacher at the Shihui Honglian Elementary School on Meizhou Road,

had a dispute with Gu Yansheng, the principal from Haimen, when he was a teacher at Fenzhou Elementary School on Fenzhou Road, and was dismissed by Gu. Seeing the newspaper report about the inhumane murder of Huang, he seized the opportunity to write a pair of anonymous letters in English and mailed them to the Yangshupu Police Station. The letters claimed that the murder of Huang was instigated by Gu Yansheng, the principal of Fenzhou School, and that the sender was involved. The police station dispatched detective Ji Xiucheng with the letters to investigate. Principal Gu was very surprised, as he did not know

Huang. Detective Ji asked him if he had any enemies recently. Gu examined the English handwriting in the letter and recognized it as Shen Weiwei's. He then explained that Shen had been dismissed in January of this year for frequently taking leave. Detective Ji immediately went to the Lianyi Elementary School and arrested Shen. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court, where police lawyer Jiang Baolian described the process and requested detention. Shen confessed without hesitation. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be detained and scheduled a joint hearing with Sheng Hongsheng.

When her family discovered her at 8:15 AM, it was too late to save her, and she had already died.

### Adopted Son Does Not Recognize Adoptive Mother - Accused of Abandonment - Court Orders Defendant to Post Bail Pending Judgment

Wu Gu, a 48-year-old woman from Chuansha, Pudong, residing at No. 5 Zhengde Lane, Myers Road, recently retained lawyer Zhang Shanle to file a lawsuit with the criminal division of the Second Special District Court, accusing her adopted son, Wu Yongrui (also known as Xue Yuncai, 24 years old, from Taizhou, residing at No. 12, Lane 816, Myers Road) of abandonment. The lawsuit states: "The defendant lost his job due to the war. In October 1937, due to financial difficulties, he requested to be

adopted by me.

Since my late husband had passed away, I granted his request to relieve my loneliness in my later years and provided him with food and lodging. I also spent over three hundred yuan on clothing for him, treating him as my own son. Up until January of this year, I also arranged his wedding, spending over seven hundred yuan. My life savings have been almost completely exhausted. Unexpectedly, he harbored malicious intentions and on March 6, due to an argument, he beat the plaintiff and

fled, taking all the furniture, belongings, and jewelry in the house,

leaving me to fend for myself. I had no choice but to temporarily return to my father's home. The defendant is currently a foreman in a hat factory, earning over two hundred yuan per month, but refuses to support me, despite my inability to provide for myself. His actions constitute fraud and malicious abandonment. I have no choice but to request the court to punish him according to Articles 294 and 295 of the Criminal Code and to order him to pay a monthly living allowance of thirty yuan, totaling three thousand six hundred yuan for ten years." The court accepted the lawsuit, and Judge Tan Hao convened a criminal

court session yesterday afternoon

for the hearing. The defendant hired lawyer Xuan Zhendong to defend him. He stated, "I lived at the plaintiff's residence with my master, Huang Kefa, in 1937. I was introduced by others as the plaintiff's adopted son, and there is written evidence. However, the plaintiff often abused the defendant and his wife, so we separated. I am unwilling to bear the monthly living expenses demanded by the plaintiff." The court reviewed the arguments and, considering the case to be clear, ordered closing arguments. Judgment was scheduled for the 22nd, and the defendant was released on bail, with the defending lawyer responsible for ensuring his appearance.

### Three Labor Strikes - Currently Under Negotiation

Drivers Demand Reinstatement - More than ten labor representatives from the Yunfei Xiang Sheng Tailai Yinse Four Taxi Companies submitted a protest to the Yunfei Taxi Company regarding the dismissal of 37 drivers, including Xu Binggao and Wang Zicheng. According to the labor representatives, the 37 drivers dismissed by Yunfei Company were recently hired several months ago and were specifically assigned to serve at the company's gambling den on Daxi Road. As the gambling den has recently been closed, the company intends to dismiss them. However, the labor representatives argued that according to a previous agreement between labor and management, drivers cannot be dismissed unless they have committed a mistake. Therefore, they requested the company to withdraw its decision. It is also reported that the two sides are scheduled to negotiate this afternoon.

Plank Workers' Conditions - The Plank Manufacturing Workers' Union, organized by the plank industry workers in this city, submitted a written request to the Plank Manufacturing Businessmen's Association on the 11th of this month to improve the treatment of workers.

The association is scheduled to distribute this request to all its members for consideration today.

Painter Strike - Yesterday, the political department of the Public Works Department mediated the painter's strike in this city. Representatives from both sides agreed to increase the daily wage for workers to a total of 1.85 yuan. After the management published a notice in the newspaper yesterday informing the workers to resume work immediately, some of the striking workers resumed work. However, some workers insisted that the daily wage be increased to a total of 2.10 yuan or 2.40 yuan, and refused to return to work. The strike has not been completely resolved. The political department summoned the management representative, Du Chan, again yesterday to discuss the matter.

### Grand Exhibition of Three Friends

The exhibition is only for a few more days, ending on the 20th. In the venue, collaborative fan paintings of calligraphy by Lai Chusheng and Zhang Youjiao are also on display, and there are many fine pieces.

### Letter

To the Editor of the Shen Bao:

Recently, I read a section in the "Local News" section of your newspaper on the 18th of this month entitled "Silk Merchant Zhang Shenglang Hinders Family," which stated that Zhu Jingwen was studying obstetrics at the Dade Obstetrics Hospital at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Gordon Road. After investigation, our school does not have this student. It is certainly a rumor. I am writing to clarify this matter and hope that you will correct it.

Sincerely,

Dade Senior Midwifery Vocational School

### Opening a River in the Examination Hall

The water for the Zhejiang examination hall is all drawn from the West Lake, which is quite far from the examination compound. Therefore, after the water carriers finish one shift of work, the gates are opened to release the water, and the ground outside the compound becomes too wet to walk on. Previously, the inside of the compound was also wet. Later, a water conduit was built to channel the outside water and pour it into the compound, creating a new system, which can be considered a well-considered and perfect solution. Now, Commissioner Mei wants to further accommodate the human element and open a river within the examination hall, connecting the water from the east and west bridges inside the main gate. However, in recent years, the Zhejiang examination hall has been plagued by various forms of cheating. External assistance is often smuggled in through the water pipes. Since the water pipes run from the outside to the inside, if someone is stationed near the water pipe, they can retrieve any oiled paper packages that flow in, and then distribute them according to the test number. How can anyone know about this? When the exam questions are released, the clear-sighted

officials write the questions in large characters above, and people outside the compound use telescopes to read them

without any mistake. The questions come from the distant tower, and the answers come in through the water pipes. This has been a problem in every session. From this perspective, opening the external river into the examination compound would make transmission even faster than through the water pipes. Some might say that the external river passes through the main gate but is outside the ceremonial gate, so it cannot reach the examination cells, and there is no need to worry too much. But how did the water pipes reach the inside? Others might say that more patrolling officials should be stationed along the riverbanks to patrol constantly, so that this problem can be completely eliminated. But which patrolling official would be willing to sit there seriously?

Chun Qiu (Spring and Autumn Essays)

### On Increasing Tuition Fees

— Xin Liang

Last Saturday afternoon, I saw a notice that my younger brother brought home from school. It listed many things to pay attention to at the end of the semester, one of which was that the school would be increasing tuition by three yuan starting next semester due to rising prices and large expenditures, in order to supplement the budget.

Then, on Sunday, I saw Mr. Xi Yushu's remarks on the issue of increasing tuition in Shanghai schools. He said, "...You must know that if teachers cannot maintain their livelihood, then no one will be willing to be a teacher; without teachers, there is no education, then the education of children will be difficult. Therefore, increasing tuition to allow teachers to have a reasonable livelihood means that children can receive a reasonable education, which is a matter of utmost public interest..."

Indeed, we all know that elementary school teachers are suffering too much these days. If teachers' lives are not stable, they will never be at peace with education. If they have to worry about firewood, rice, oil, and rent every day, how can they have the energy to devote to teaching? Therefore, increasing tuition so that teachers can live a reasonable life, and indirectly, children can receive a more reasonable education, is indeed something that should be done without a doubt.

I only hope that every school that has had surpluses in the past and is not planning to increase tuition starting next semester is the best. If they have to increase it, then they should do as Mr. Xi Yushu said: to raise teachers' salaries, and not to use the name of increasing fees to seek personal enjoyment and benefit.

### Alive

— Yun

Shouting at the top of my lungs all day, dragging my slightly swollen legs home, the only thing I love is the tattered quilt on the narrow bed. But after lying down and relaxing my muscles, I have to grade the ninety arithmetic exercises that I brought back. It's almost impossible to have a comfortable dinner. Alas! Being a teacher! It's more tiring than managing ninety machines, my goodness!

It's dusk, washing clothes, mending socks, and being able to sleep peacefully, but the clock always refuses to sympathize with my busy schedule and insists on striking eleven o'clock. If my older sister hadn't promised to take care of the two children during the day, I'm afraid I wouldn't even be able to keep this ten yuan a month job.

Watching the clock hands pass twelve o'clock, after finally coaxing four-year-old Xin to sleep with great effort, but before the light has been off for even five minutes, my heels and shoulders start to itch. I'll try to endure it! I'm afraid it will wake the child again. Anyway, every corner of the lonely island is home to those hateful night thieves. I should develop a calm and composed attitude at night, and then use lightning tactics during the day to clear their nests. That's why the always small Yun gets angry and attacks these annoying creatures, so that she won't lose sleep from being woken up. But the mice are angry that they can't break through the iron can to get at the few remaining crackers, and somehow they knock it over on the ground, rolling and throwing it with all their might. They have attacked my weak point, knowing that I won't get up to bother them. But if they really open the can and ruin these crackers, how will I soothe Xin's nighttime cries? So I have to put them next to my pillow, although I still can't sleep soundly. I'm afraid I won't be able to get up by six o'clock tomorrow to make it to my first class, so I silently count one, two, three, four, five... faintly, it seems like the bell is ringing, and our class of autumn students comes rushing into the classroom like a tide. Suddenly, a child's toe gets stepped on, and he squats at the door crying. Just as I'm about to go over and pull him up, something slaps me in the face, and I wake up in shock. Xin is crying and angry, flailing her legs like drums. No wonder it seemed in my dream that the students' footsteps were shaking my body. It's really funny and annoying at the same time.

Xin, you're really my nemesis! You're simply taking my life! You don't forgive me at all for the life of a cow and horse that I lead as a mother. These short six hours of sleep are the only tonic for prolonging my life. Why do you always have to cry three or four times a night, making me stay up all night with you? Am I not going to die? I once beat you hard, but afterwards, I couldn't help but shed tears, thinking about the money that your father sends from Chengdu. Aside from half of it being used for exchange rates, and the delay in time, if I didn't have this teaching job, wouldn't I really be hanging up three mouths every month to wait for assistance? So, I patiently coax you to sleep again, and let myself get a moment's sleep, to take on the responsibility of teaching tomorrow.

### A Notice in the Shelter

— Citizen

"Notice: It has been found that refugee Zhang from District ×× secretly allowed an outsider without a tag to stay in the district. After investigation by the night duty officer, it was confirmed and admitted. The law of joint liability should be enforced, and the refugee and his family should be expelled from the shelter. It has also been found that refugee Li from District ×× has bad behavior and does not maintain order. Yesterday, when entering the shelter from outside, he should have been checked for a tag by the correction officer, who has a duty to do so. The refugee not only did not comply, but also responded with insults. After the correction division questioned him and tried to persuade him, his attitude remained fierce. Considering the circumstances, he is intentionally disrupting order. To maintain the safety of the entire shelter, it is appropriate to expel him from the shelter. This is a combined notice to serve as a warning to others!..."

The above notice was personally seen by the writer in the ×× shelter on June 14, and it was heard that it was executed on the same day. After seeing the notice, I couldn't help but feel that the notice was self-contradictory. If the correction officer checks for tags when refugees enter the shelter, how can there be an outsider without a tag staying in the district? At the same time, whether the wording in the notice is suitable for the identity of the shelter is also a question. Words such as "law of joint liability" and the "questioning" in the questioning, the shelter becomes a yamen, what about charity!

### The Stamp on the Pawn Ticket Also Accrues Monthly Interest

— Mirror

All financial transactions in society use evidence, and enough stamps must be affixed to the evidence. This is true for all industries, and the pawn industry is naturally no exception. However, the procedure for affixing stamps in various industries is the obligation of the issuer of the evidence, so the pawn ticket should undoubtedly be the responsibility of the pawnbroker. However, although the pawnshop affixes the stamp on behalf, the stamp fee is still included in the pawn price. This not only requires the pawner to bear the stamp fee, but also to bear 1.8% monthly interest on the stamp tax. What kind of rule is this?

Hawthorne Detective Cases

### Homecoming After the Dance

— By Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Two: "A Page of the Past!"

Li Zhiban was a man of about fifty. Although he hunched his back and coughed as he walked, showing some signs of age, his complexion and eyes were still vigorous. He was not tall, and his muscles were relatively thin. His hair was gray, cut in a round-top style, and he did not have a beard. He wore a dark blue old crepe de chine camel-hair robe and old-fashioned double-strap black satin-faced cloth-soled shoes, appearing simple but dignified and generous. Later, I learned that he was a private tutor in Wuta Town in the countryside of Wu County. This kind of dress was indeed appropriate for his profession.

After Hawthorne greeted him, Ni Jinshou introduced them to each other, and they all sat around the small round table. I also sat at one end of the long bench. Due to Qun Sang's inquiry, which seemed to focus on the deceased's past, the old man explained his relationship with the deceased and the circumstances before she engaged in a life of dancing.

Li Zhiban said, "Lilan's childhood name in the countryside was A'bao. Her father was my brother-in-law and also taught in the countryside. A'bao—Lilan—lost her mother at the age of seven and her father at the age of nine. After that, I raised her and she studied in my private school for several years."

"A'bao—Lilan—changed her ways at the age of seventeen because a woman named Zhaodi from the same town returned from Shanghai. According to Zhaodi, she worked in some factory and earned a good income. Lilan, hearing Zhaodi's exaggerated descriptions and seeing Zhaodi dressed like a young lady from a wealthy family, became envious. She clamored to go to Shanghai with Zhaodi. I tried to dissuade her repeatedly, but to no avail, so I had to let her go. Once she arrived in Shanghai, she never returned to the countryside. I thought she was working in a factory, but I didn't know she was involved in this dancing business! Now it has taken her life! Alas! It really wasn't worth it!" He sighed repeatedly and coughed twice. (Nineteen)

### A Meeting with the Wan Brothers, Pioneers of Chinese Cartoons

— Tai Gong

Special Interest in Cartoons, Hoping to Add Glory to the Film Industry

The most outstanding figures in the domestic film industry engaged in cartoon work are currently the four Wan brothers: Laiming, Guchan, Chao Chen, and Di Huan. Currently, Di Huan is far away in the mainland, and Chao Chen is in charge of the Wan Brothers Photography Studio. The eldest brother, Laiming, and the second brother, Guchan, were hired by the China United Film Company in May to head the cartoon department and produce full-length cartoons. The first film, "Princess Iron Fan," is currently in active production. Yesterday, the reporter visited the Lianhe factory site in Lilac Garden and had a conversation with the Laiming and Guchan brothers in the cartoon department. Here is an excerpt:

From a young age, they grew up in Nanjing and studied together at Jinling Middle School. After graduating, the brothers came to Shanghai together and entered the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts. With shared interests, they studied fine arts and photography together, and gradually began to pay attention to cartoons. After leaving the Academy of Fine Arts, Laiming became an editor at the Commercial Press, while Guchan worked in the film department of the Commercial Press.

In 1925, the two brothers joined the Great Wall Film Company. "Making a Fuss in the Study Room" was the maiden work of cartoon short films in the Chinese film industry.

In 1927, an American came to Shanghai to establish a cartoon film company, preparing to specialize in cartoon films. However, due to poor business, it was announced that it would be shut down. In this way, the Wan brothers bought all of the American's cartoon equipment. After testing it, it turned out to be excellent. Thus, "Paper Man's Troubles" was born. Subsequently, Lianhua's "Dog Detective" and Mingxing's "Camel Dancing" and "New Life" were all co-produced by the four Wan brothers and screened. After the August 13th Incident, Laiming left Shanghai for Chongqing due to the poor environment. Before long, Guchan was hired by the Wuxi Provincial Education College to serve as a cartoon lecturer and practical instructor in the film and broadcasting major. Later, as various places fell one after another, Guchan went from Zhenjiang to Nanjing, Hankou, and then to Chongqing. In Kunming, he met his elder brother Laiming. They once wanted to open a photography studio, but it was unsuccessful due to frequent air raids. In September of last year, the two brothers returned to Shanghai. Laiming opened the Wan Laiming Photography Studio, and in April, at the invitation of Zhang Shankun, he cooperated and joined Lianhe to be responsible for the cartoon department. The official head of the department is the second brother, Wan Guchan. The eldest brother, Laiming, is nominally the deputy head due to his photography studio business.

Before the two joined Lianhe, a capitalist from Hong Kong (also in the film industry) asked Sun Jun Jinghai to come to Shanghai to negotiate with the Wan brothers, intending to invite them to Hong Kong to run the cartoon business. However, because of Lianhe's invitation first, the result was that they did not go to Hong Kong. However, Wan left a message for Sun Jinghai to convey to that capitalist, saying that after completing "Princess Iron Fan," perhaps his wish could be fulfilled. However, once "Princess Iron Fan" is successfully produced and achieves extremely satisfactory results, whether Lianhe will be willing to let the Wan brothers go to Hong Kong to work for others is another question.

### Hollywood Needs Voluptuous Stars

— Jin Huang

—Losing Weight May Not Be Necessary.

Female stars are most afraid of gaining weight, and often spare no expense or endure pain to lose weight. Slim stars have always been envied by the masses. However, it is said that this phenomenon is about to be overturned. Not long ago, in the new film "Lillian Eussell," sixty fat women were selected to participate in the performance, but they were performing in the style of 1890.

There will probably be more opportunities to hire fat actresses in the future. The war has changed Hollywood. The European market has shrunk, and film companies have to develop in South America. However, South American audiences do not welcome thin actresses. It may be too early to determine that Hollywood must change in this way. However, it is possible. Look, Mae West has attracted a large group of discerning audiences, hasn't she? In fact, a fashionable figure like Joan Crawford is somewhat restrictive of nature.

### "Hometown of White Clouds" Completed During Bombing

— Yi Xing

The last scene of "Hometown of White Clouds," directed by Situ Huimin, was shot at the home of the heroine Fengzi in Shanghai. The set was on the beach in Hong Kong, a luxurious small Western-style house, with seawater, a beach, and tall mountains standing on the other side of the sea. Part of this scene was shot on location in Hong Kong, and part was built in the factory's studio. The entire crew of the factory's art team designed and built it, taking more than a week to complete.

The last shot of the scene was filmed exactly when Japanese planes were bombing Chongqing. The entire crew of the film calmly completed the last shot during the bombing.

Also, Minister Chen (Cheng) of the Political Department of the Military Commission, and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Chuan (Zuoyi), visited the filming of the film that day and praised the hard work of the entire crew. They took a group photo with the entire crew of the film as a souvenir.

### Paramount Hires New Talent

In the Paramount film "Night of January 16th," the male lead, Don Ameche, quit halfway through, and mediation was unsuccessful. Paramount has filed a lawsuit in court, seeking compensation for a loss of $170,000. This was noted in this column a few days ago. It is now known that Paramount originally invited Claudette Colbert to play the female lead in the film, but she declined. Then, Bela Starfill was invited to take on the role. However, when Don Ameche quit halfway, Bela Starfill also refused to continue filming, and the film had to be temporarily shelved. Among Hollywood stars, Don Ameche's temperament is known to be the most kind, so this sudden change of heart has surprised the outside world. Paramount has finally decided to cast the new female star Patricia Marrison and Ray Milland as the male and female leads in the film. The original director of the film, Mitchell Leisen, has also been transferred to direct the war novel "La Polonaise."

### Silver Screen Miscellany

— Hai Xing

Meicheng's Production Policy. The production policy of Meicheng Film Company, initiated by Yan Heming, is slightly different from that of ordinary companies. It is said that it does not intend to follow the old path of folk films, but will open up a new path. It has already decided to cooperate closely with the drama world and plans to bring successful plays to the screen one by one. In addition to acquiring the filming rights to "Hai Guo Ying Wei," several other masterpieces are also being negotiated separately. The famous playwright Wei Ruhui is wholeheartedly helping, and it is expected that Meicheng's productions will refresh the audience's eyes and ears in the future.

The Yan Sisters Sign a Contract. Yan Yuexian is making a comeback and has reportedly joined Xinhua Company. Her sister Yueling has also joined at the same time, both signing long-term contracts. However, the works have not yet been decided. This news was not released by Xinhua Company, but it is generally reliable.

Wu Cun Choreographs "Chronicles of the Dance World". Wu Cun told reporters that if there are copyright issues with "Tears on the Flowers," Jin Xing will definitely give up. I think the dance venue material is very good, and the lives of the dancers have many moving and admirable aspects. The dancers' interactions with the diverse clientele provide great material. Therefore, Wu Cun plans to film a piece titled "Chronicles of the Dance World," which has been largely finalized.
