### Although Japan Changes Scope of Demands, Tensions in Vietnam Remain High; French Officials Believe Agreement Possible Soon; Rumor of Sino-French Agreement on Military Cooperation in Kunming

Hong Kong: According to reliable Chinese sources, Japan recently demanded the right for its troops to land anywhere in Vietnam without a limit on the number of soldiers. It is reported that Chongqing has requisitioned telegraph and other transportation matters between Chongqing and Kunming for military use. (Reuter, 21st)

Hong Kong: A Hong Kong dispatch reports that, according to credible sources, China and France recently held secret talks in Kunming, discussing military cooperation measures in the event of a Japanese invasion of Vietnam. At that time, the French side would not oppose Chinese troops entering Vietnamese territory. (Reuter, 21st)

Hanoi: According to French officials here last night, after Japan altered the scope of its final demands on Annam, French-Japanese negotiations resumed yesterday and are progressing well. French officials are even impressed that the outcome of these consultations may lead to an agreement being reached soon, possibly before the "midnight of doom" deadline this Sunday. As for the nature of Japan's demands, it has not been revealed as of yesterday. It is only known that the most important condition is Japan's desire to obtain naval and air bases in Annam. Regarding how Japan changed the scope of its demands, official circles are tight-lipped. However, it is generally speculated that there will be no concessions on important points, and French officials indicate that this agreement may be reached this weekend, giving equal rights and interests to both France and Japan. Observers here believe that the sudden change in attitude of French officials is clearly influenced by French Foreign Minister Baudouin's statement in Vichy this week. The statement implied that Britain and the United States would not provide France with any substantial assistance in resisting Japan's aggression in Annam. (United Press, 21st)

Hanoi: Regarding the current French-Japanese negotiations, the scope of Japan's demands has been altered, and both sides are actively continuing negotiations in a more favorable environment. An agreement can be reached in a short period of time, taking into account each other's interests. Regarding this, responsible sources claim that during the negotiations, the territorial integrity of Vietnam and French sovereignty have never been in question. (Havas, 21st)

Hanoi: Because the Vietnamese government openly declared that Japan's recent demands had forced the negotiations into a stalemate, the situation in Vietnam suddenly turned critical today. The Vietnamese government's communique announced the rejection of Japan's recent demands and strongly stated that, based on recent instructions from the Vichy government, the Vietnamese government can only take a firm stance. The leader of the Japanese delegation, Major General Nishihara, and his entourage have left for Haiphong. French troops have implemented emergency preparations, awaiting orders to act. Vietnamese trains are also prepared to evacuate women and children to the south in the event of an emergency. The Vietnamese government's communique stated that the negotiations resumed yesterday had gradually reached a resolution, but when the agreement was about to be concluded, the Japanese side raised new demands, causing the negotiations to fall into a stalemate. The Vietnamese government's communique did not mention the content of Japan's new demands, but it is believed that the demands that the French cannot accept include (1) the occupation of Hanoi by 20,000 Japanese troops, (2) the management of the Lang Son and Lao Cai railway sections, and (3) the use of the Gia Lam airfield near Hanoi. (United Press, 21st)

New York: The New York Times Washington correspondent claims that the US State Department believes that the urgency of Japan's invasion of Vietnam may be the most difficult immediate problem in US foreign relations. (Reuter, 21st)

Tokyo: The Japan Times stated in an editorial today that the Japan-Vietnam conference is not related to the United States. It stated, "Whatever understanding is reached between Japan and the Vietnamese authorities only concerns Tokyo and Hanoi." Regarding Washington's claim that the United States cannot tolerate Japan changing the status quo in Vietnam, the newspaper said that since the American people have no substantial interests in Vietnam and the attitude taken by the United States in the past was very distant, "Isn't it strange that they suddenly feel interested in this matter?" It should be noted that the newspaper's tone has always been regarded as a reflection of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' views. (United Press, 21st)

French Cabinet Holds Meeting to Review Situation in Far East

Vichy: The French Cabinet held a meeting here last night to review the situation in the Far East. Before the meeting, the French government announced that it had received a "strong invitation" from Japan to end the protracted French-Japanese negotiations on Vietnam. It is announced here that the French government has already decided to end the negotiations as much as possible in order to control Japan. It is believed here that the delay in negotiations in Hanoi, Tokyo, and Vichy is the result of the French insistence on respecting Vietnam's independence and integrity, and French sovereignty in the colony, in the new military and economic agreement. It is said that Tokyo's "strong invitation" requires the negotiations to be concluded "within days." French officials here did not confirm external reports that the Japanese note was a final ultimatum, expiring at midnight on Sunday. Informed sources here believe that, as a result of last night's cabinet meeting, an agreement may be reached with Japan this afternoon or at the latest by Sunday, accommodating most of Japan's demands. French Foreign Minister Baudouin told American reporters yesterday that, given France's current situation, it may recognize Japan's power in the Far East, because Britain and the United States have both failed to agree to provide Vietnam with material assistance in the event of a Japanese invasion of French territory. (United Press, 21st)

People in Chongqing Observe Vietnam Situation, Fear French Will Succumb

Chongqing: After the news that Japan had presented Vietnam with a new ultimatum, demanding that 25,000 Japanese soldiers transit through the country and establish naval and air bases, with a deadline of midnight on Sunday, reached here, everyone paid close attention to the situation in Vietnam. It is believed that Vichy's statement accepting Japan's demands and the issuance of Japan's final ultimatum are adding final pressure to Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux. Although Decoux has adopted a firm stance, he is isolated and weak, and it is feared that he will eventually succumb. If Japanese troops land, Vietnam will be quickly occupied, because Vietnam's military strength is weak and may not be able to offer effective resistance. Chinese military vehicles are preparing in great secrecy, but it is rumored that Chinese trucks are now gathering on the Yunnan-Guizhou border, and over 200,000 elite troops of the Central Army, led by the most capable senior officers, are now guarding key border areas. Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin recently flew to Kunming twice to inspect defense work. (Reuter, 21st)

Hundreds of Japanese Residents Begin to Evacuate from Hanoi

Hanoi: Japanese residents began evacuating yesterday morning. Hundreds of people have already taken special trains to Haiphong and transferred to Japanese ships. Personnel from the Japanese Consulate and members of the monitoring group will also leave somewhat later. On the day the Japanese residents boarded the train, Japanese Consul General Suzuki led the Japanese residents in singing the Japanese national anthem. Japanese Chief Representative Nishihara commented on the Japan-Vietnam negotiations, saying that when he is sure that the negotiations are hopeless, he will leave. At that time, you can say that the crisis has arrived. What kind of development will occur after he leaves Vietnam can only be said by the Japanese government. Now he is on very friendly terms with the French authorities, and the talks are very intimate. Japan has not made new demands, but wants convenience for the war against China, such as military and air bases. The Japanese attitude does not threaten the territorial integrity of Vietnam or French sovereignty, but Japan is convinced that the situation requires a final resolution of Japan's military needs in Vietnam within a deadline. (Reuter, 21st)

Hanoi: Yesterday morning, a total of 147 Japanese residents and members of the delegation sang the Japanese national anthem and shouted "Banzai" before taking a special train to Haiphong. However, although the Japanese residents were leaving Hanoi in droves yesterday, their attitude was quite confident, especially the delegates. When the members of the Japanese delegation left the hotel where they were staying in Hanoi, they gave the waiters Japanese yen as tips for drinks, saying that in the near future, the Japanese currency system will be commonly used in Annam. (United Press, 21st)

Hanoi: The leader of the Japanese military delegation, Mr. Nishihara, told reporters yesterday that French-Japanese negotiations are progressing smoothly in a sincere atmosphere, and it is hoped that yesterday's tense situation will be alleviated. Nishihara said yesterday that if the French-Japanese negotiations break down, he is prepared to leave, first to Haiphong,

Editorial

### Review of the German-Italian Talks

After German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived in Rome on the 19th of this month, he held several days of secret talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. Aside from issuing a brief official communique stating, as usual, that the two sides' views were consistent, the content and results of the talks have not been officially announced. According to reports from American news agencies, the two leaders have begun drafting a "New European Order" plan to be implemented after Italy occupies Egypt and Germany occupies Britain. According to news from French news agencies, the main issue of this meeting was a review of the relationship between the Axis powers and the Soviet Union and Spain. In the German semi-official view, in addition to future strategies, the Danube and Spanish issues were also mentioned.

Regarding the so-called "New European Order Plan," it is possible that the warring Germany and Italy may discuss it in advance, but it is still relatively distant. Since we have not received more detailed information, we do not need to speculate. According to our conjecture, it seems that the German reports are closer to the truth. In other words, with Germany's attack on Britain not yet successful and Italy's attack on Egypt just beginning, what the German and Italian authorities are anxious to exchange opinions on seems not to be the distribution of future interests, but the handling of current problems and the determination of future strategies.

The primary task of belligerents during wartime is, of course, to pay attention to military affairs, which need not be discussed. The second task is to win over allied countries and undermine the enemy's alliance. Before the outbreak of the war last year, Germany first won over the Soviet Union, making it a "pro-German neutral country." This was the first step. This year, it turned Italy from a "non-belligerent country" into a belligerent country. This was the second step. Now it is Spain's turn to be won over. Before Ribbentrop went to Italy, Spanish General Franco first sent his confidant Suner to Berlin to negotiate with the German authorities. As soon as Ribbentrop returns home, it is said that the talks will continue, and then he will go to Rome. Judging from the recent rumors that Spain is about to officially declare war on Britain and that Germany and Italy are encouraging Spain to participate in the war and promising significant rewards, the clues are really impossible to ignore. Assuming that Franco decides to participate in the war, he will definitely demand the recovery of the Port of Gibraltar in order to disrupt Britain's interlocking relationship with the Mediterranean and even East Africa. This would, of course, be of great benefit to the military actions of Germany and Italy, so it can be said that there is no doubt that the Spanish issue was mentioned in the German-Italian talks.

It seems that simply winning over Spain as an ally is not enough, because in the eastern Mediterranean, there are still Turkey and Greece, which are possible allies of Britain. We must find a way to pull them over in order to achieve perfection. However, this is not an easy task. First, Turkey and Greece are relatively strong countries in the Balkan Peninsula. If they must be conquered by force in order to force them to alienate Britain, that is something that Germany and Italy are unwilling to do, because Germany and Italy plan to expand their power in the Balkans without bloodshed. The past encouragement of Hungary and Bulgaria to divide Romania, as well as the subsequent support of the Romanian Iron Guard, are concrete manifestations of this strategy. Therefore, unless there is a sure chance of winning or they cannot extricate themselves, Germany and Italy will never make it real, so as to disperse their forces for the war against Britain. Second, the Balkans is the region where the interests of all parties are intertwined and the contradictions are the most serious. The Balkan Wars in history were the result of great powers fighting each other. As far as the current situation is concerned, in addition to Britain's potential influence in Turkey and Greece, the Soviet Union's concern and attempts are also important objects that Germany and Italy cannot ignore. In the past scene of dividing Romania, we can see the Soviet Union's "no step is let go" principle. In the future, no matter what activities Germany and Italy want to do in the Balkans, they may cause the Soviet Union to make "equal demands." This is why the two leaders of Germany and Italy must review their attitude towards the Soviet Union at the same time when discussing the Danube issue.

In summary, it can be seen that in the future, in addition to trying to encourage Spain to participate in the war at a heavy price, Germany and Italy still need a considerable period of arrangement and negotiation in the Balkans. These days, it has been widely reported that Bulgaria is again asking Greece for a corridor in the Thrace region. At the same time, Italy's demand that Greece abandon British guarantees and Albanians' propaganda that they want to reclaim Ciamuria seems to be in full swing. Under this situation, the Soviet Union's attitude, especially the relationship between the Soviet Union and Turkey, is worth twelve points of attention. Regarding this point, we can only expect the Soviet authorities to break their temporary silence themselves.

And then return to Tokyo. The evacuation of Japanese residents is not because they think the crisis has arrived, but because there is a possibility of turning into a bad tendency. According to Mr. Nishihara, if the negotiations are indeed hopeless, he plans to go to Haiphong first, and then return to Tokyo. As for the new requirements put forward by Japan, if France unfortunately refuses them, then what steps will be taken in the future should be decided by Tokyo. The leader of the Japanese military delegation denied the outside speculation that the new requirements put forward by the Japanese side have deviated from the scope of the Tokyo-Vichy agreement, and stated that the Japanese delegation has always strictly followed the conditions of the Tokyo-Vichy agreement. He also criticized France for adopting a delaying attitude since the Tokyo-Vichy agreement was signed three weeks ago, repeatedly ignoring Japan's suggestions. When reporters asked about US Secretary of State Hull's previous statement that he was deeply concerned about maintaining the status quo in Annam, Mr. Nishihara replied that the status quo in Annam has not been threatened, the integrity of Annam has not been violated, and the relationship between France and Japan is like the cooperation between the United Kingdom and the United States. (United Press, 21st)

Hanoi: Nishihara met with American reporters yesterday in the heavily guarded Japanese military delegation's office and reiterated that the Japanese people have a particularly friendly feeling towards France and that the Japanese people have no opposition to France. (United Press, 21st)

### French Newspaper Describes Course of Negotiations on Vietnam

Clermont-Ferrand: "Le Petit Parisien" recently published an article entitled "Vietnam and the Relations between France and Japan," reviewing the course of negotiations between France and Japan since June 13 this year. The article stated that former Governor-General of French Vietnam, General Catroux, accepted Japan's request on June 13 and ordered the closure of the border between Vietnam and China, and in principle agreed to conduct commercial negotiations with Japan. Not long after, Britain also followed the request of the Japanese government and closed the Yunnan-Burma Highway. After the Konoe Cabinet was formed, Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka again requested the Vietnamese authorities on August 2 to allow Japanese troops to pass through to the Chinese border. The French government immediately and formally rejected it. At the same time, because France was harmed by the idea of ​​past dangers, it was necessary to curb it and to respect pragmatism. Therefore, it expressed to Japan its willingness to conduct negotiations on the general relationship between France and Japan and was prepared to take into account Japan's special position in the Far East. This view was notified to the US government, but the US attitude was quite vague. The French-Japanese negotiations were then conducted in Tokyo by Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka and French Ambassador to Japan Henri, and a general agreement was reached immediately. The normal evolution of this agreement was nothing more than the prelude to future negotiations between the two sides in Hanoi on economic and military agreements. After that, the Vietnamese authorities and the head of the Japanese delegation, Lieutenant General Nishihara, conducted negotiations in order to establish a "faithful understanding" so as to satisfy Japan's requirements while preserving Vietnam's independence and the sovereignty that France retains over Vietnam in accordance with the French-German armistice agreement. In short, our overseas territories are still the government's most concerned matter, because all colonies trust France and share weal and woe. France must pay close attention to their integrity and prosperity. (Havas, 20th)

Vichy: When the Vichy government received Japan's first request to send troops to China through Vietnam on August 2, "Le Petit Parisien" contacted the United States, but detected that the United States could not take a practical attitude, and France had formally rejected the Japanese request. However, the government did not recognize Japan's superior position in the Far East in order to deal with reality. Negotiations were conducted in order to establish an agreement that Hanoi could use as a basis for detailed discussions. At this point, Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux and Japanese representative Nishihara began talks, and to this day, the talks between the two sides continue, with mutual determination to seek understanding. On the one hand, the French side is giving Japan the satisfaction that the French government considers legitimate, and on the other hand, it will guarantee the independence of French Vietnam and the sovereignty of France.

### British Newspaper Says Vietnamese Governor's Position Has Become Increasingly Difficult Recently

London: The Times stated in an editorial today that although Britain has not received any news about the conclusion of an agreement between France and Japan on Vietnam, there is reason to believe that the Vichy government has accepted most of the requirements put forward by Tokyo in principle. The position of Vietnamese Governor Decoux has become increasingly difficult due to Thailand's more extensive territorial demands. (Reuter, 21st)

Hanoi: Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux, on the occasion of the autumn opening of various schools, published a letter to the students of French schools, stating, "On the occasion of the start of this new school year, I would like to offer a slogan and advice to the students of primary and secondary schools throughout Vietnam. In this painful era, you must have the courage to live and think of your motherland and your parents and hometown, and think of the French motherland that is encountering great suffering. You must know that our motherland, as Marshal Pétain said, is eternal and will never perish. However, the future of the motherland depends on your efforts and will. From now on, you must pay attention to your daily work, strictly abide by discipline, be vigilant at all times, and always maintain friendship between French compatriots and Vietnamese natives. In the past, French schools have completed profound and powerful work in Vietnam, unifying the French and Vietnamese languages ​​and ideas. Therefore, all my dear students now have two responsibilities: one is to think of the motherland, trust the motherland, and obey the motherland; the other is to recognize French Vietnam, maintain Vietnam, and work hard for Vietnam." (Havas, 20th)

### Thailand Submits Three New Demands to Vietnamese Authorities

Chongqing: Chinese sources say that Thailand has made the following new demands to Vietnam: (1) To draw a new border along the Mekong River, transferring forty small islands in the river to Thailand; (2) To cede the land southwest of the Long An River to Thailand; (3) Vietnam guarantees fair treatment of ethnic minorities in northern Vietnam. If Vietnam does not accept the above demands, Thailand will revoke the Vietnamese-Thai Treaty of Non-Aggression. Chinese sources believe that Thailand was instigated by Japan to make this request. The Ta Kung Pao warned Thailand not to follow in the footsteps of Poland, which made territorial demands when Czechoslovakia was in a difficult situation. The newspaper also said that small and weak countries must cooperate to seek their own security. (Reuter, 21st)

### The Dover Strait is Calm and Windless; German Plane Activity Did Not Cease Throughout the Night

### British Forces Adopt New Tactics; German Planes Are Defeated and Retreat During Daylight Raids

London: According to the British Air Ministry, the Royal Air Force used its new "double-layered pincer attack" tactic yesterday afternoon to defeat 300 to 400 German planes over London. However, at night, the German planes returned with twice the number, seemingly seeking revenge for their daytime defeat. Therefore, heavy-grade destructive bombs rained down on central London. One German plane glided down from high altitude, its engine noise ceasing. It descended to a low altitude over the city streets and quickly dropped two high-explosive bombs, which landed in the very center of London. Then, it revved its engine and escaped through the anti-aircraft fire network. During this German night raid, the entire anti-aircraft defense force in London emitted a louder roar than ever before, and the entire horizon was surrounded by an edge formed by lines of gunfire. Reports also indicate that other cities in Britain were attacked at night. German planes flew at low altitude in the darkness.

British fighter planes engaged the enemy, but interception was difficult due to heavy cloud cover. According to incomplete reports, four enemy planes were shot down, and seven British fighter planes were also lost, but the pilots of three were safe. (21st Reuters dispatch)

### British Planes Braving Thunderstorms; Fiercely Attack German Bases; Flames Light Up the Sky Across the Channel; German Canal Traffic is Severely Damaged

London: The Royal Air Force continued to attack German bases prepared for the invasion of England last night. Observers watching from the British cliffs on the Strait saw, under the moonlight, flames lighting up the sky and artillery fire flashing along the French coast from Calais to Boulogne. Projector lights swayed, indicating that the Germans were desperately resisting. However, the red light reflecting in the sky when bombs exploded proved that the British pilots bravely attacked and skillfully hit their targets. (21st Reuters dispatch)

Berlin: At 2:15 this morning, this agency learned from reliable sources that the British planes' attacks on Berlin and Hamburg last night completely failed due to the ferocity of German anti-aircraft fire and the effectiveness of fighter planes. British planes attempting to reach Hamburg were dispersed near the Elbe River estuary. Another team penetrated western Germany, but was driven back by German planes in the province of Hanover. (21st Haitong dispatch)

London: The Air Ministry Intelligence Department reported that on Thursday night, British planes attacked the canal north of Münster, braving bad weather. This canal is a very important transportation line within Germany and has been attacked repeatedly and severely damaged. Although the Germans are making great efforts to repair it, it can still be used. On Thursday night, when British planes flew to this destination, there was thunder and lightning, and heavy clouds obscured the sky and land. Fortunately, the weather suddenly cleared, and high-explosive bombs were dropped repeatedly, hitting targets and exploding. British planes also braved heavy rain to bomb the ports on the Strait. Flushing was heavily attacked again, and the port and the Walcheren Canal were hit by high-explosive bombs. Ships in the canal exploded continuously after being hit by bombs, with the last explosion being the most intense. British planes also braved intense artillery fire to attack the docks of Dunkirk at low altitude. Another team of British planes bombed railway freight yards in Mannheim and Aalen, and the main railway line in Koblenz, a bridge over the Rhine, and several airfields were also attacked. The British planes returned safely. (21st Reuters dispatch)

Heidelberg: According to witnesses of the British plane attack on a Heidelberg workers' residential area, the British planes circled low several times before dropping bombs. One house was hit by seven bombs, killing a city official and his two children. The city of Bruchsal in Baden province was also bombed. British planes dropped bombs at low altitude in densely populated residential areas. Because of the bright moonlight, the ground houses were clearly visible to the British pilots. Many houses collapsed, killing three men, women, and children, and seriously injuring one person. The historically famous Bruchsal Castle was also bombed and heavily damaged. (21st Haitong dispatch)

### Italian Forces Invade the Border; Egypt Will State its Position; No Significant Changes in the Western Desert Situation; British Naval Aircraft Fiercely Bomb the Port of Benghazi

Cairo: It is expected that within a few days, the Egyptian cabinet may not reach any decision regarding the attitude toward the Italian invasion. According to *Al-Ahram*, there are currently two different schools of thought in Egypt. The first believes that the current Italian encroachment cannot be considered a serious invasion and is willing to wait for the Italian intentions to become clearer. The second believes that the Italian occupation of Sidi Barrani with a large army undoubtedly indicates the Italian intentions and urges immediate action. At the same time, domestic security measures have been strengthened. (21st Reuters dispatch)

Cairo: The Speaker of the Egyptian House of Representatives, Basa Makhmakh, said in a speech in Mansoura that the Egyptian people must work together to defend their independence and expel the enemy from their land. The struggle that will determine the fate of Egypt is ongoing, and Egyptians cannot stand idly by. (21st Reuters dispatch)

Cairo: The General Command issued a communiqué stating that there are no changes in the situation in the western desert of Egypt, and there is nothing to report on other fronts. (21st Reuters dispatch)

Cairo: It is reported that when the British naval air force raided the Benghazi base in Italian Libya this week, they completely caught the enemy off guard. Two clusters of ships in the port, including the main target destroyer, were hit by heavy bombs. One of the clusters caught fire and burned, and when the second cluster was bombed again, a destroyer was hit and exploded with a bang. When the British planes completed their mission, the flames illuminated the city, and the entire port appeared to be on fire. (21st Reuters dispatch)

Cairo: The British Air Force communiqué stated that British Air Force bombers flew to the port of Benghazi and, braving intense anti-aircraft fire, bombed the ships in the port. It was observed that three large ships were hit and caught fire. Enemy ships near Sidi Barrani were also bombed for four hours. British planes attacked the Dire Dawa airfield in Abyssinia, and a hangar was hit and caught fire. The enemy planes took off to intercept but failed. An enemy plane night raid on the outskirts of Alexandria caused slight damage to houses, but there were no deaths or injuries. The enemy planes were driven back by anti-aircraft fire. British South African Air Force planes flew over Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland for extensive reconnaissance. (21st Reuters dispatch)

Athens: According to Greek newspapers, a British convoy, consisting of eight destroyers, two cruisers, and one aircraft carrier, protecting twelve merchant ships from Britain, Turkey, Egypt, and Greece, was bombed by the Italian Air Force off Crete yesterday. An Egyptian ship was heavily damaged, and many other ships were scattered by the bombing, with varying degrees of damage. (21st Haitong dispatch)

### Gandhi Makes a Statement Before Meeting with the Viceroy of India; Says He Will Not Take Threatening Actions

Madras: It is reported that Gandhi, who has recently regained full power in the All-India National Congress, stated before meeting with the Viceroy of India that if the Viceroy allows him to meet, he will not go with a pistol to threaten the Viceroy, but to prove that the inferences he has drawn from the government's actions are indeed correct. (21st Reuters dispatch)

Wardha: It is now known that Gandhi's involvement in war affairs in the All-India Congress is abnormal in principle. Gandhi said a few days ago that he would not meet with the Viceroy with a pistol. Many observers regard this statement as a sign of a change in the Congress's position, or that it will cancel any threatening actions during the war. A responsible interpretation of the All-India Congress's resolution stated that if members are now allowed to freely express their opinions, that all wars are barbaric, and that India is not participating in a war it does not want to participate in, then political demands can be put on hold.

### British Submarine Sinks German Transport Ship; Crew Members Narrate the Experience

London: An officer of the British submarine *Sturgeon* recently described the sinking of a German transport ship, saying that the submarine sailed to the Skagerrak Strait between Denmark and Norway on the morning of September 2. The wind was strong, and at dusk, the submarine's hydrophone operator faintly heard ship sounds. The submarine submerged, and after a few minutes, two small German destroyers were seen, followed by a very large transport ship. The British crew immediately prepared the torpedo tubes and fired a torpedo. In an instant, a roar was heard, and a plume of smoke was seen rising from the transport ship. The submarine then sailed away. At one point, an airplane was searching directly above the British submarine, but it did not detect the submarine. About ten minutes later, the transport ship caught fire, spreading from stem to stern, and sank half an hour later. When the submarine resurfaced, it was in the searchlight beam of the two destroyers, but the destroyers were three miles away and did not see the British submarine. It was found that the transport ship was a single-smokestack *Diesel* type ship with a weight of about 10,000 to 12,000 tons. It was torpedoed while sailing north to a port in Norway. According to Danish sources, this ship was carrying 3,000 to 4,000 soldiers, but it is not known for sure whether these men were intended to be used for the invasion of England.

### German Troops Practice Invading England on the Dutch Coast

Giessen: Dutch travelers who arrived here by boat yesterday told people that they had seen thousands of soldiers drowned during a German invasion exercise. It was claimed that "about one mile from the Netherlands, countless soldiers boarded flat-bottomed boats and were ordered to jump into the sea and swim, without untying their weapons. We, living nearby, saw more than a thousand bodies of officers and soldiers floating on the water, and many soldiers mutinied. As a result, they were all sent to the German interior." Some travelers claimed to be able to provide evidence of this, but none were willing to reveal their names. (21st Haitong dispatch)

Roosevelt's Speech Warns the American People: If Willkie Is Elected President, Democratic Politics Will Inevitably Be Destroyed

Philadelphia: President Roosevelt, in a speech yesterday while accepting an honorary degree from Ben Shervani University, warned the American people that if Republican candidate Willkie is elected, he will take the management of the American government away from the people and lead American democracy to destruction. The President declared, "I dare say with regret that there are people today who want to hand over the American government to those who feel they are slightly better than ordinary citizens because of their commercial or economic abilities." Although the President did not mention Willkie by name when he made this statement, it was clearly directed at his political enemy, the Republican Party. The President continued, "The attempt by a minority of superiors to force the majority of inferiors to vote has often been seen in American history. As for me, I would rather trust the collective judgment of the directors, managers, foremen, and all the workers in a factory than the judgment of those few who have an economic interest in that factory. This is a surprisingly regressive era in the cultural history of the world. In some places, there have already been incidents of burning books, exiling scholars, and using government orders to forcibly determine religion, morality, and cultural forms. In this kind of era, we should not be satisfied with merely formal celebrations for the bicentennial of this free and independent institution of higher learning. Today, I am deeply honored to be awarded an honorary degree by Ben Shervani University. The establishment of this university was for many who do not have sufficient material resources to enjoy higher education, to be able to study religion and learning. The founders of this school have made it an educational source for poor children to avoid dropping out of school. In the past two hundred years, the existence and evolution of this school has been a permanent and powerful symbol of the concept of freedom of thought and action in America." The President then listed the political ideas of Hemel and Jefferson, pointing out that the latter advocated for public management of politics, and said that if a country's vote, whether we are highly educated or own property, can freely exercise its right to vote, then this country will never be in danger of falling into the hands of a tyrant. He continued, "In terms of elections, I would rather believe in the collective judgment of the directors, managers, and workers in one or two factories than the judgment of the few who have an interest in the factory, and the collective judgment of landlords, farmers, and agricultural workers is more well-founded than the individual judgment of the landlord alone. If free elections exist, no one part of the population can permanently control our country's government. The safety of the American government lies in whether free elections can be maintained. In history, no dictator can exist in an environment of truly free elections. This basic truth is common sense for the American people, but to understand the experiences of other countries, this principle should be kept firmly in mind. Don't lose the fist. Ten years ago, the German people lost their democratic system based on free elections, so Nazism was able to seize the opportunity. After the Nazi Party seized power, the new German regime eliminated all rights to free elections and free election of government leaders, so since 1933, the German people have had no such rights. Under a democratic system, human beings should abandon pride and prejudice in thought and action, and seek and guide the truth sufficient to maintain human freedom with courage, sincerity, and humility."

European War Talks (10) (1) A Perspective on the Pétain Government

The inside story of France's capitulation has already been translated and published in this newspaper. But what kind of organization is the Pétain government? Now, we will translate and record the dissection made by reporters from the New York Herald Tribune and the Manchester Guardian to serve as an answer:

The Pétain government is often referred to by the world as a "dictatorial" government, accusing the French people of betraying democracy, abandoning their allies, and calling Pétain a puppet in the hands of the conservative Laval. While these accusations are not entirely without reason, they mostly seem to be caused by a lack of understanding of the enormous spiritual and material disasters suffered by France.

The reporter once spent the last days of free life with the French people, which were also days of great suffering. He deeply knows that the French people are very clear that they are not only losing their independence but also have the possibility of national demise. In the previous Great War, France lost 1.5 million people, and the impact of this huge loss is still being felt today. Twenty years later, another war broke out, and the French nation was already discouraged.

Pétain initially organized the government in Bordeaux and called for an armistice. At that time, he may have been a puppet, but France did need Pétain because he was not a "politician" but a great figure in the military. He deeply knew that the nation's strength could not continue to fight. General Weygand also supported Pétain. Even the general French public mostly did not advocate continuing the war in Britain or in French colonies.

When the reporter discussed the issue of war and peace with people in the French government in Bordeaux, many of them said that the French navy and the French garrison officers and soldiers in North Africa and Syria would probably not enthusiastically fight against Germany because they were concerned about their families still in the occupied areas. Based on the reporter's conversations with fellow French sailors on the way from Tours to Rochefort, he deeply knew that this statement was not false.

Most of these sailors came from the provinces of Brittany and Provence. If the war continued, these two provinces would inevitably be bombarded. The unstable elements in the French fleet must also understand that there were many dangers in the fleet retreating into foreign military ports.

When the armistice agreement was signed, the French army had actually disintegrated, and the air force had also been largely damaged. Pétain and Weygand were clearly concerned about maintaining France's future unity and believed that the French nation could not withstand further losses.

The new French government must now lead the defeated country through major difficulties and humiliations. The French public all believed that the slowness of the parliamentary system and the disputes between parties were the main reasons for France's defeat. Therefore, after the armistice, it was not surprising that the French authorities reorganized a semi-dictatorial government.

Mayor Henry of Versailles was appointed by the Pétain government as the ambassador to the United States. Before departing for the United States to take office, he gave a speech at a banquet for American expatriates in Paris. He was the first French official to give a public speech in Paris after its fall.

Mr. Henry said briefly, "I am qualified to speak on behalf of the government, but I do not have the right to speak freely. My words and actions must be cautious. The position of the French ambassador to the United States has never been as difficult as mine, and my mission will also be difficult. France has suffered the most tragic defeat in its history. France fought not because it was attacked but because it wanted to act in concert with other countries. Today, France has suffered great sacrifices, losing hundreds of thousands of sons, but France does not believe that its spirit will perish from this."

Today, those who conquer France also know that the French spirit will never diminish and will continue to exist to resist all obstacles and hardships. As long as the spirit does not die, the French nation can look forward to a better future. Although everything is extremely difficult at present, the world can believe that the French nation will be able to revive.

Below is a report from the former Paris correspondent of the Manchester Guardian:

There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding in the outside world about the true nature of the Pétain government. It is also a misunderstanding to regard it as a "right-wing fascist government." It is true that the Pétain government has various pro-fascist tendencies and anti-British sentiments caused by recent events in France, but the Pétain government also represents the special concept that France has had in recent years, which is fatalism. Those who hold this view believe that France is an old country that cannot resist the more powerful autocratic countries, so it is better to adapt to the situation that will dominate Europe for the next few hundred years as soon as possible.

According to those around General Pétain, the top priority is to maintain the life of the French nation, even if it means enduring humiliation for a long time. They are never willing to risk the destruction of the French nation. Some French people underestimate the viciousness of the German methods and often say to reporters, "Even if Britain can be destroyed, France is a country that cannot be destroyed."

General Pétain's idea of France as an old country coincides with the idea of "seeking revival from humiliation" held by some French people. This idea is most strongly advocated by new socialists such as Mayor Marg of Bordeaux.

Thierre believed that France would inevitably be defeated. After the French army's line on the Meuse River was broken, Thierre expressed his opinion in the lounge of the Chamber of Deputies, saying, "The location for seeking peace should be on the Seine River rather than the Somme River, on the Loire River rather than the Seine River, and on the Garonne River rather than the Loire River." His meaning was that it was better to seek peace as soon as possible, and those who supported the Munich Agreement now argued forcefully, saying, "Everything we did in the past was to save France from the predicted disastrous defeat."

It was not only right-wing people who supported the Munich Agreement and held the view that defeat was inevitable. Among all parties, such as the Radical Party members Ponle and Xu Dan, and the Socialist Party members Fourier and Folais, all had a strong sense of inevitable defeat. These left-wing pro-peace members all had representatives in the Pétain government, so it is a mistake to call the Pétain government a "right-wing government." The Pétain government actually contained all those who deeply believed that France would be defeated.

France will not perish. No matter how many years of suffering it endures, it must seek self-help from combat. This belief has long been deeply rooted in the hearts of the French people. When the reporter returned home from Bordeaux on a ship, he saw many French refugees on the ship in conflict with each other. This scene was lamentable. As a result of the conflict, a large number of French refugees decided to leave the ship and return to Bordeaux, regardless of the dangers ahead. This shows the French people's attachment to their homeland and their determination to stay in their country no matter what kind of tragedy they encounter.

Even though their homeland has been ravaged by invaders and betrayed by politicians, its people still feel reluctant to leave. This is a typical French national characteristic. The reason why there is no danger of political figures in the country being assassinated and few people flee overseas is also because of this. Although the French people fled from Paris to Tours and Bordeaux, they were unwilling to avoid other places. Regardless of whether the future is good or bad, they are willing to stay in the country and prepare to passively resist the invaders.

Italy's armistice conditions with France seem to be more moderate on the surface than expected, and they do not stipulate that Italian troops will occupy a large amount of French mainland territory. The intention of this is undoubtedly to lure pro-Italian elements in the Pétain government to realize the illusion of Franco-Italian cooperation against Britain.

Australian Federal Election: Prime Minister Advises All Parties to Abandon Selfishness and Ambition

Sydney: The Australian federal election is being held today. The number of candidates being put forward is unprecedented. The leaders have all issued statements focusing on dealing with the war situation. Australian Prime Minister Menzies and Labor leader Curtin both urgently want a majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Although Curtin also advocates helping Britain, he believes that Australia's defense is more important than sending troops overseas. The House of Representatives should fill 75 seats in this election, and there are as many as 273 candidates competing. There are also 65 candidates competing for 19 Senate seats. Menzies said on the radio last night that no matter which party is in power after the election, it should receive public support. The danger ahead is too great. All parties should abandon selfishness and ambition to serve the future of the world and should not weaken their strength due to internal divisions. (Reuters, 21st)

Finance: Forward US Dollar Unusually Tight

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listing remained unchanged. The trend of the British-US exchange rate in the black market was mediocre in the first half of the day. It opened slightly stronger in the morning, but soon after speculators piled in, it returned to flat. Later, trading was sluggish and the situation was dull. Until noon, a foreign bank took advantage of Da Tong to suddenly increase its buying interest in forward US dollars, so forward rates became unusually tight. As a result, spot rates were flat overall, and forward rates were flat for the British pound and soft for the US dollar at 0.03125. No market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Importers Piled in to Settle

In the early morning, both near and far London large bars were flat, New York silver prices were unchanged, and London raw gold was stable. Exchange rates were flat for both British pound to US dollar and British pound to Shanghai currency, and there were no increases or decreases for either US dollar to British pound or US dollar to Shanghai currency. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same as before. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 3 3/8 pence for the British pound and 5.28125 yuan for the US dollar, which was 0.015625 higher for the British pound and 0.03125 higher for the US dollar compared to the previous close. However, speculators and import trading houses piled in slightly, and the market quickly returned to flat. It was reported that US dollars for this month were sold for 5.25 yuan, and interbank trading of US dollars for October was also at 5.25 yuan. At that time, the spot US dollar could only be settled at 5.25 yuan, and the shilling also weakened to 3 3/8 pence and 484375. HSBC's listing was announced as unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was also announced as flat. After that, the market was very quiet, and trading was extremely sluggish. Until 11:30 am, a foreign bank took advantage of Da Tong to suck in September US dollars at 5.25 yuan, and the market situation remained flat. By the close, the British pound was at 3 3/8 pence and 484375, the US dollar was at 5.25 yuan, the British pound for October was at 3 3/8 pence and 46875, and the US dollar was at 5.21875 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, the British pound spot rate was flat, the US dollar spot rate was flat, and the October rate was slightly tighter at 0.03125. No market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Hong Kong Market Had No Ups or Downs Yesterday

Hong Kong, September 21st: The exchange market opened flat this morning, with no ups or downs in any exchange rate. (Note: Yesterday, the Shanghai exchange spot rate rose to 428 yuan). At 11:30 am, it was reported as flat, and there were still no changes in any exchange rates. No market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Tianjin US Dollar Also Tight

Tianjin, September 11th: The exchange market opened with fluctuations this morning. Spot rates for the British pound, Shanghai exchange, and "joint banknotes" in the black market had no ups or downs. The spot rate for the US dollar was unusually tight at 0.0625, at 5.03125 yuan.

Wealthy Merchants Absorbing Gold Again

Yesterday, the Shanghai cash raw gold black market tended to stabilize. Although the price once rose to over 6,300 yuan under the absorption by wealthy merchants in the city, the rumor that the Japanese side softened in the midst of chaotic news from Vietnam and withdrew the Edemson book of mourning still made most people feel optimistic. It opened in the morning and rose to 6,290 yuan under the absorption of wealthy merchants. Gold shops and small money changers sold vigorously, and it was seen to fall back. However, with the foreign exchange tightening, silver shops helped to push up strongly, and it flew up to 6,305 yuan. The rumor was beneficial to sellers, and securities firms suddenly came to sell, and a return wind was immediately seen. It retreated to 6,250 yuan, and finally rose again to 6,280 yuan at the close due to the soft forward US dollar and people's optimism. It轧rose another 15 yuan. It was found that more than 3,000 taels were traded in the first half of the day. In the afternoon, there was no market for Saturday delivery, and the price rose again to around 6,300 yuan. Decorative gold, customs gold, etc. were all flat.

Raw Gold Good for 15 Yuan

Although the exchange market was reported to be strong in the early morning, it weakened shortly afterwards, so people remained firm. In addition, a certain silver building, entrusted by wealthy merchants, came to search for purchases first, and the market opened up 25 yuan. A certain silver building entered more than 100 taels from gold shops and silver shops, all at 6,290 yuan. Although a certain silver building still came to grab purchases, the selling pressure on the desk was strong for a while, and gold shops and scattered households scrambled to sell. It soon fell back to 6,265 yuan. After that, the number of sellers decreased sharply, and the price recovered upward. Relying on another gold shop and silver shop to help pull up, it rose to 6,305 yuan. Then there were many high-priced sellers, and the market situation changed suddenly. Silver shops and gold shops spit out, and it fell more than 20 yuan. Suddenly, it was rumored that the Japanese side's attitude towards Vietnam had softened, and there was a saying that Edemson's book of mourning had been withdrawn. The number of sellers increased, and the silver shop helped to sell even more vigorously. It once reached a low of 6,250 yuan. After 11:00, the market situation stabilized, and the price fluctuated upward again. It was also heard that the American bank had a strong appetite for the US dollar at this time. Securities firms suddenly turned from outflow to inflow, and another silver shop took advantage of the momentum to increase its bets. Before the close, it reached 6,290 yuan again, but the close was 6,280 yuan, 轧rising 15 yuan compared to yesterday. The potential was still strong after the close, and someone was buying at 6,290 yuan. The difference in the first half of the day was 55 yuan. The selling price of cash shops' own-brand gold was more than ten yuan higher than raw gold, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there was little trading.

Decorative Gold Still Unchanged

The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops is still unchanged. Da Tong Hang still hangs at 640 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang is similar to the previous price, reducing the purchase price by about 30 yuan.

——September 21st——

The Foundation of the National Currency

Because of the recent issuance of various new banknotes in Chongqing, speculators in the Shanghai market have unintentionally fallen victim to some kind of malicious propaganda and false reporting, and have begun to act again, thinking that the Chinese government will truly embark on the path of inflation. This is truly a case of fools worrying about themselves! It should be known that Chongqing is under heavy bombing by the Japanese, and government agencies have moved to the countryside, and people have also left Chongqing due to evacuation. As a result, banks have had large amounts of banknotes withdrawn by agencies and people. Therefore, since the end of August, banks in Chongqing have restricted the withdrawal of banknotes, limiting each person to 1,000 yuan per day, with the remainder given in bank checks, until September 9, when banks no longer restricted the withdrawal of banknotes. Such a large amount of banknotes flowed out from the bank's vault to various places, and naturally could not return to the bank's vault for a while. In order to cope with daily payments, the bank had to strengthen its inventory. It is the important task of the government bank to regulate finance. Since the market in Chongqing deeply felt the lack of banknotes, it was only right to transport banknotes to help. Given the complexity of the types of banknotes issued by Chinese government banks and the divergence of versions, it is impossible for all types and versions of banknotes to circulate in the market. If banknotes that have not been seen locally in the past are rashly used, people will naturally pay attention to them because they have never seen them before. This is nothing to be surprised about. It is also a routine procedure for banks to make a public announcement before issuing them. However, speculators used this as an opportunity to engage in malicious propaganda and speculation, disregarding the interests of the country and the nation, and only seeking to profit from troubled waters. As a result, they were unknowingly used by others, and they themselves suffered losses if the national currency was affected by the worries of fools.

Therefore, Shanghai, as well as every Chinese citizen throughout China, should trust the national currency and support the national currency. It should be known that although China's national currency system was established before the war, its prosperity and growth were fully established during the war, laying the foundation for its indestructible resilience. It is not only the only successful currency in Chinese monetary history, but also the only currency that China has now and will have in the future. Moreover, it is the only sound currency in this turbulent world where the value of currencies in various countries is unstable. It is China's only lifeline for resisting Japan and building the country during the war, and for stabilizing finance and promoting industry and commerce after the war. The Chinese government will never abandon the foundation it has laid and maintained with great difficulty over the past three years and embark on the opposite path of destruction and devastation of inflation at this turning point when the war of resistance is entering its fourth year and victory is approaching.

The increase in the amount of national currency issued is undoubtedly undeniable, but given the past chaos in China's monetary situation, the fact that the national currency system had not been implemented in vast and remote provinces before the war, and the huge amount of funds required for economic construction in free China during the war, it can be seen that the increase in issuance is entirely due to objective economic needs, not subjective fiscal needs. The increase in issuance should not be regarded as inflation. (For more on this point, please refer to the Financial Commentary of July 21, "Review of the Amount of National Currency Issued.") The Chinese government has been striving to avoid inflation from the beginning. At the beginning of the war, it promoted the remittance system, using remittance bills to control the circulation of currency. It successively promulgated various regulations on saving the country through thrift and national construction, and measures for fixed-term savings deposits in foreign currencies, as well as temporary measures for managing banks during extraordinary times, in order to encourage savings and absorb funds, and implement contraction of currency and control of issuance. Therefore, in the three years of the war of resistance, the issuance of national currency has increased from 1.4 billion to 3.9 billion, an increase of less than two times, while still maintaining 48.4% of gold and silver and foreign exchange reserves valued at 191.7 million yuan. Compared with the issuance of 1,867,788,000 yuan increased to 4,211,700,000 yuan by the three banks of Japan, Taiwan, and Korea, with only 12% of gold and silver reserves valued at 509,445,000 yuan, the strength of its foundation is self-evident. It is hoped that speculators in Shanghai will not fall victim to malicious propaganda and false reports, and should remain calm, trust the national currency, and support the national currency!

Setting Commercial Exchange Rates for Hong Kong

After the national currency commercial exchange rate was changed to 4 1/2 pence against the British pound from August 1, other exchange rates were calculated based on its market exchange rate with the British pound and the newly set 4 1/2 pence. At that time, the author estimated that it would be 7.5375 against the US dollar and 3.34 yuan against the Hong Kong dollar, but since then there have been no reports on the exchange rates against the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar. Yesterday, a Chongqing telegram said that the commercial exchange rate against the Hong Kong dollar has been set at 3.33 yuan. This market price differs from the author's estimate by one cent, and the calculation is based on 4 1/2 pence and 1 shilling and 3 32/1 pence, while the government's determination this time is based on 1 shilling and 3 pence.

Now that the exchange rate against the Hong Kong dollar has been set, what we are currently waiting for is what the exchange rate against the US dollar will be. However, if the British pound is freely exchanged for US dollars under British control, the commercial exchange rate against the US dollar can be calculated according to the statutory pound price, which is still around 7.5 yuan. Conversely, it will be calculated according to the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar to the US dollar or the free pound price in Shanghai, and the market price will be 100 yuan of national currency equal to about 6.75 yuan of US dollars.

In passing, I would like to mention that there was a rumor in the Shanghai market a while ago that the commercial exchange rate would be changed from 4 1/2 pence to 3 pence. At that time, the author denounced it as nonsense. Now that the exchange rate against the Hong Kong dollar is set at 3.33 yuan based on 4 1/2 pence, speculators who want to use this rumor to operate in the foreign exchange market should be utterly disappointed!

Counterfeit Chinese Banknotes with No Place Name in the 24th Year of the Republic by Yun

The identification of genuine and counterfeit banknotes of the Bank of China has been seen in this newspaper for the past two days. It was said that there were counterfeit banknotes of the Bank of China with the Shanghai place name in the 24th year of the Republic, and there were no counterfeit banknotes without the place name. However, counterfeit banknotes are emerging endlessly, and counterfeit banknotes without the place name in the 24th year of the Republic have recently been discovered. The printing is exquisite. Not only are the concave and convex patterns clearly distinguishable, but there is also no difference in color between the front and back. The patterns around the front, the four characters of the bank name, and the image of the Founding Father are all similar to the genuine ones. However, the white mesh pattern in the black center around the five yuan number in the middle is thicker than that of the genuine banknotes. The trees and clouds on the mountains in the scenery of Beihai Park on the right and the bridge scene are not as clear as the genuine banknotes. The printing on the back is slightly worse, such as the lines of the bank's new building scenery, which are not as obvious as the genuine banknotes. The five characters of Ali Bo in the four corners and the heart-shaped patterns are crude. The yellow mesh pattern on both sides under the English bank name is earthy yellow for the genuine banknotes and light yellow for the counterfeit banknotes.

However, for this kind of counterfeit banknote, for example, a bank receives more than 100,000 banknotes every day, and they are mixed in the middle. The cashier and the customer who checks the banknotes all seek to be quick, and it is over in an instant. Careful inspection is not allowed by the facts. Moreover, most of the bank's business counters operate under lights, and it is inevitable to receive counterfeit banknotes by mistake. According to bank regulations, the shortage of counterfeit banknotes must be borne by the cashier, so it is not easy to be a bank teller.

Foreign Currencies Continue to Rise

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: Raw gold fluctuated slightly and rose. The British and American gold pounds also rose slightly by five jiao. The latter also knocked on the 150 yuan mark. The demand for British gold bills continued, and the price rose by 7.5 jiao. The American gold bill finally rose by five fen. The demand for Hong Kong bills was increasingly strong, and the market price continued to rise by four fen. The Japanese gold bill continued to rise, reaching a high of 1.52 yuan in the evening market. The supply and demand for Korean bills was uniform, and the market price remained stable. The evening market was still 1.18 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Market Tends to Hover

The soybean market once suffered from the impact of sluggish sales and fell. Although export sales started to move in the past two days, people's hearts were scattered and the development was mediocre. Although the source of new beans is not surging at the moment, they are arriving one after another, so the strength of the buying is not strong, and it is difficult for the overall situation to escape the hovering situation. Yesterday, Hong Kong gangs and local merchants took in 89 packages of Jiading soybeans at a price of 35 yuan to 35.5 yuan. Hengqiao beans were priced at 36.5 yuan per 100 packages. More than 200 packages of Taicang beans were priced at 35.05 yuan. 100 packages of Liuhe beans were priced at 34.7 yuan. 150 packages of Anqing beans were priced at 32.6 yuan. 80 packages of Changzhou cowhide yellow beans were priced at 33 yuan. Since Japanese merchants searched for small horse feed beans, the broad bean market once became active. However, the unfavorable import exchange rate made the buying weak. Others were also not greedy for buying, so it was difficult for the market sentiment to rise. The supply and demand of sesame were equal. Due to the lack of large households doing business, the market situation was relaxed.

In addition, 500 packages of raw peanuts and 1,325 cans of raw oil were shipped from Yantai to Shanghai yesterday.

In addition, today there are 3,860 packages of beans, 985 bean cakes, and 300 cans of raw oil. There are also 100 pieces of tea leaves, all shipped to Hong Kong.

Securities: Domestic Debt Sees a Resurgence of Upsurge

Yesterday's securities black market suddenly saw a resurgence of upsurge, and people's hearts were extremely firm. Since September 10, the small decline has continued for six or seven days. Since 56.95 yuan, Class C has broken through 6 yuan, 5 yuan, 4 yuan, and 3 yuan. It has fallen by more than 3 yuan. On the one hand, bulls have emerged, and on the other hand, shorts have increased their bets. The number of floating loans delivered was very large. After accumulating for a long time, there was a depletion of chips, and the market began to抵補floating shorts. Class C has broken through the 5 yuan mark, and trading in the market has suddenly become lively, with a tendency to rebound again. From the perspective of supply and demand, large households are absorbing again, and there is demand again on the 16th. Buying started first, followed by Xinfu, Hengfu, Jiufu, and Xie Da, etc., buying at market prices. Although Lianyi, Jiufeng, Shengchang, and Yongkang, etc., continued to supply, the market still felt that demand exceeded supply. The morning rose by half a yuan. In the afternoon, Shengda's buying appetite was extremely strong, buying more than 200,000 yuan. Jiufeng turned from selling to buying, and Hengfu continued to buy. Hongda also bought a lot. Lianyi continued to sell. Xie Da had some spitting out. Datong, Yichang, and Lianhe had some supply. Scattered households had more outflow than inflow. In the afternoon, it rose by another 3 to 4 jiao. As a result, it unanimously rebounded by 3.5 to 9 jiao. The total turnover was about 1.1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Food: Foreign Rice Rises Again, Domestic Rice Sources Are Controlled Again, New Japonica Rice Arrivals Are Still Not Weak

After the consecutive flatness of foreign rice, the market seemed to be moving towards a smooth road. However, yesterday, the cargo side borrowed the Vietnam issue to stir up people's hearts and pull up market prices. The market was already thriving in the morning and was not affected by the surge in domestic and foreign rice arrivals. Shantou gangs and floating households added to the buying, and the market became even tighter. Prices immediately increased by 6 to 7 jiao to nearly a yuan. No. 1 Saigon was at 68.2 yuan, No. 2 was at 63.2 yuan, fire-milled was at 67 yuan, and small-milled was at 62.2 yuan. Yinghua Si's original package No. 2 Siamese opened with dozens of tons in the early morning, priced at 70 yuan, with insurance and other fees excluded. However, the cargo side also rallied and shouted higher after the middle of the market, so the deal was not completed. It is said that the number of foreign rice transactions is calculated based on the two-way customer hoarding, totaling about 7,000 packages.

Although there were no glutinous rice arrivals, the inventory was still abundant, but the sales path was sluggish, so the market fell by another 5 to 6 jiao. Kaijin Litte was at 69 yuan to 67 yuan, Changdan was at 67.5 yuan, and Hong Kong Special was at 68 yuan to 67 yuan.

The sources of thick, thin, and broken japonica and other domestic rice were blocked. Seeing that the foreign rice market was strong, the actual sales were slightly active. The black market prices continued to be set, with Changbang white japonica opening at 78 yuan, ordinary at 70.7 yuan, Wuchang Su Kun japonica high at 77.5 yuan, and second at 73.4 yuan. Bai Mao Kou secondary japonica was at 73.2 yuan to 72 yuan. Qingpu thin broken middle was at 76 yuan. Nanhang early broken was mostly transported by merchants and arrived daily. The original package opened well at 75 yuan, middle at 74 yuan, and rough at 71.5 yuan to 71 yuan.

The sources of new japonica pointed tips from various routes totaled about 2,000 dan by land and 7 to 800 dan by water, but most of them were directly purchased by rice shops, so the market transaction was flat and the market was stable. Dongxin opened at 71 yuan to 69 yuan, and Xixin at 73.5 yuan to 70 yuan. The rough price of Taicang Jiading sheep tip was 59 yuan, and the Du tip was 60.5 yuan to 60 yuan.

North Gang Actively Buys Local Powder, Customer Prices Are Almost Equal to Foreign Powder

Flour: Yesterday's flour market remained firm. Although the disk of the No. 2 flour mill was still at the original price of 16 yuan, the most that buyers wanted to purchase was only a few dozen or 1 to 200 bags. Therefore, the spot goods of Fuxin and Lao Che powder became increasingly scarce, and the

Weekly Supplement The "Heart" of England

The "heart" of England, the Midlands, covers 21,000 square miles. It extends east from the North Sea, south to Birmingham, west to the Irish Sea, and north to Stockton. This square region truly contains the lifeblood of England.

In terms of military importance, this area is similar to Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New England in the United States. Pennsylvania and New Jersey are the centers for steel mills, coal mines, and munitions factories, while copper mines, machine factories, and aircraft factories are concentrated in New England. These three states occupy a very important position in the national defense industry of the United States. If the factories, railways, and highways in these areas were subjected to continuous bombing or occupied by enemy forces, the fighting power of the United States would be greatly affected.

Over the past two centuries, the "heart" of England has been propelled by the Industrial Revolution to become the world's greatest industrial region. Its resources and manpower have broadcast the might of Britain to a quarter of the Earth's surface, allowing Britain to dominate world commerce for the past 125 years. The British invested the surplus funds from the development of India in this industrial region, collected wool from Scotland, cotton from the United States and Egypt, and coal and iron from Britain, Switzerland, and Spain, transforming raw materials into goods to be sold around the world.

Since India, Japan, and the United States have independently developed their textile industries, the textile industry in this region of England has suffered some losses. However, the production of valuable goods is increasing, making it the largest producer of various military weapons and daily-use metal utensils. For example, Sheffield produces knives, swords, precision instruments, cannons, metal steel plates, munitions, and ship machinery; Birmingham produces train locomotives, buttons, wedding rings, machine guns, copper bed frames, safety pins, tires, and automobiles; the six cities between Stockton and Trent produce various ceramic utensils; and the shipyards in Barrow-in-Furness, Birkenhead, and Liverpool can manufacture various ship hulls.

Along the eastern coastal plains, various foods needed by the British are produced. The coastal ports are extremely rich in fishery and salt resources. Hitler, understanding that this heartland of England was the driving force behind British international trade, sought to completely destroy this region after the outbreak of the war. In reality, it was there that the British fleet was built to protect the British Empire.

Various industries in the area have developed along both sides of the Pennine Mountains. Between Manchester and Leeds, it is divided by a mountain gorge. In the early 19th century, the British excavated a canal through this gorge. (See "British Civilian Life Before the War" in this newspaper's "European War Talks".) This canal connects the Mersey, Aire, and Humber rivers, which is extremely beneficial for shipping. The underground coal and iron reserves on both sides of the Pennine Mountains are extremely abundant. The industrial centers of Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham, Derby, Birmingham, and Manchester are all located along these mountains. These cities, with their towering chimneys, are shrouded in coal smoke day and night, and the furnaces burn fiercely, giving them the reputation of being the "Black Country." Living in such a harsh and uninteresting environment, it is no wonder that the people there are exceptionally stubborn in nature. The major cities are connected by highways and railways, making transportation extremely convenient.

Since June, Hitler has made this area the largest target for bombing England. When German bombers fly overhead, they can always find industrial targets worthy of being destroyed by bombs. The transportation network of railways, waterways, and the Thames River is used to transport munitions very frequently. If the bombs hit the key points accurately, it would have a significant impact on the supply of military equipment.

Apart from the London area, this region is also the main base for the British aviation industry. Leeds is the birthplace of naval dive bombers and fighter planes. A company called Fairey Aviation in Stockport, Lancashire, can manufacture a type of aerial torpedo. A factory in Christchurch on the River Avon specializes in the production of Vickers long-range heavy bombers. The Wellesley and Wellington aircraft are produced in this area. Avro Anson aircraft, used for coastal patrol, are manufactured in Manchester and Yeadon. The famous Rolls-Royce engines are produced in Derby.

The ports of Liverpool and Hull, one connected to the Irish Sea and the other to the Humber River on the North Sea, are the heartland of American waterways. The Germans are most focused on destroying transportation in these two places. The railway junctions in Crewe, Derby, Peterborough, Spalding, Stamford, Shrewsbury, and Christchurch are most vulnerable to bombing damage. Great Grimsby on the Humber River, normally a fishing port, has been transformed into a concentration camp for torpedo boats and a location for huge oil depots during wartime. There is also a radio station nearby that connects to Australia. Leeds is the largest industrial area for meat and leather in England. The British Northern Command Headquarters is located in York.

The water along the southern coast of the East Sea is relatively shallow, making it difficult for large ships to navigate or dock in many places, but this phenomenon is not universal. In the far north, the coast north of Bridlington has natural fortifications of cliffs and precipices, with green rocks that often reach over 600 feet in height. However, south of the Humber River, the rocks are gray-yellow and lower in height, and the beaches are generally 10 to 20 yards wide.

Mines have long been buried in the Humber River, and it also has a Danish-style naval defense route weathered by wind and frost. The low, flat shoals of the Wash estuary, several miles long, are not very suitable for naval landings due to their shallowness. South of the Wash in the Fens—everything is very much like the Netherlands: tall, blond residents, windmills in the sky, and cyclamen everywhere—the entire area is filled with dikes. The broad area close to the coast is interwoven with ditches and is very solid and flat, all the way to the East Anglian hills.

The British air defense there is also quite dense. The number of air force and civilian aviation airfields is not small, allowing them to advance to attack or retreat to defend. The deployment of anti-aircraft guns in the densely populated towns is also not weak. In addition, along both sides of the Pennine Mountains, the slopes are steep, making it very difficult for enemy aircraft to land there. The top of the Pennine Mountains is sparsely populated, a wilderness. Apart from some grassland, the rest is overgrown with weeds and cannot support life. However, paratroopers can find a few flat areas to land and places to hide, and then descend from the mountains to disrupt transportation between the villages. The British discovered the difficulty of guarding this desolate wilderness in the early summer of this year, because the only passable routes are narrow paths, and the only protection is gray stone walls.

### Bertrand Russell's Essay on Academic Freedom (Continued)

Organized, politicized education is a major danger of our time. Appearing in the form of nationalism, it provokes international wars; appearing in other forms, it provokes civil wars. The teacher's mission is to stand apart from partisan strife, striving to instill in young people the habit of impartial research, judging the merits of issues, and preventing them from accepting one-sided theories. Teachers should neither flatter the prejudices of the crowd nor cater to the secrets of officials. Their professional ethics should be fair to all parties, stepping outside of right and wrong, purely as objective scientific research. They should not hesitate to cause public anger with the results of their research.

However, the teacher's mission is not only to invisibly resolve the intense disputes of the present. They also have positive missions to fulfill, and one cannot become a great teacher of the age without the desire to fulfill these missions. Therefore, teachers bear a greater responsibility than other classes for the preservation of civilization. They should also deeply understand what civilization is and cultivate a civilized attitude in their students. What, then, is a civilized society?

The common answer to this question largely uses material achievements as the standard. For example, a country with many machines, many automobiles, many bathrooms, and fast transportation is considered a civilized country. However, in my opinion, most modern people overemphasize these things. Civilization, in its more important sense, is a matter of the spirit, not a material matter of physical enjoyment. Therefore, knowledge occupies a part, and emotions also occupy a part. In terms of knowledge, a person should understand their own relationship to the world in time and space, as well as the relationship of their environment to the world. They should view their country not only as the land where they live but also as one of many countries in the world, all with equal rights to survive, think, and feel.

In terms of emotions, if a person is truly enlightened, they also need to expand their scope, extending themselves to others. From birth to death, humans are sometimes happy, sometimes unfortunate, sometimes generous, sometimes greedy, and always calculating; sometimes heroic, sometimes cowardly and humble. In their lifetime, there are certain things that stand out and are worth valuing. Some people are inspired by their impulse to love humanity, some help us understand the world in which we live through their superhuman intelligence, and some produce art through their special sensitivity. These people produce "good" that benefits humanity, far beyond the brutality, oppression, and superstition of long historical periods. Within their power, they make human life more like that of civilized people than during the times when barbarians roamed. A civilized person, for some occasions, cannot express approval, then they should first understand the truth instead of simply denouncing. In other words, they should find the root of evil and seek ways to eradicate it, not just hate the people who have fallen into sin. All of this is the intellectual and emotional understanding that a teacher should have. Only with this understanding can they instill this mission in the young people they teach.

A person cannot be a good teacher unless they have enthusiasm for their students and a desire to instill valuable knowledge in them. However, this attitude is different from that of a propagandist. A propagandist does not want their disciples to examine the state of the world and freely choose valuable goals. The propagandist is like a gardening expert who wants to train students to bend when they should bend and stand straight when they should stand straight, just like a gardener cultivating bonsai. In order to hinder the natural development of their disciples, they do not hesitate to destroy their noble spirit, giving them jealousy, destructiveness, and brutality. Humanity does not need brutality; I believe that most brutality is the result of improper early education, or rather, being misled down the wrong path.

The fanaticism of oppression and abuse is extremely common, and examples of it abound throughout the world today. But this is not an indispensable part of human nature. On the contrary, I believe it stems from some misfortune. It is also the teacher's mission to broaden the student's horizons, pointing out to them that there are other actions that are welcomed by the masses and are beneficial to people. Therefore, they should allow their good instincts to fully develop and prevent the growth of the desire to deprive others of happiness. Some people criticize the purpose of happiness as being for oneself and for others. Giving up personal happiness for public purposes is one thing, and viewing the happiness of the masses as unimportant is another. But the latter's actions are often carried out in the name of false heroism. Those who adopt this attitude generally have a brutal undertone, and the cause of this action may be due to unconscious jealousy, which often originates in childhood or adolescence. The purpose of the educator is to train adults to get rid of this psychological misfortune and cultivate a psychology that is unwilling to harm the happiness of others.

As shown by current facts, many teachers cannot fully fulfill the responsibilities they are capable of. There are many reasons for this, some of which are relatively accidental, and some of which are deeply rooted in tradition. Most teachers teach too much, and as a result, they consider it finished when they have trained students to complete exams, and they are unwilling to give students free psychological training. People who do not teach do not know the energy that teaching takes. Pastors do not need to preach for several hours every day, but teachers have to work for several hours every day, and as a result, most teachers suffer greatly and become overly sensitive. They cannot study the latest published teaching materials they are teaching, nor can they encourage their students to develop interest in gaining new ideas and new knowledge.

But this is not the most serious problem. In many countries, certain opinions are considered correct, and others are considered dangerous. Teachers who are considered to have incorrect opinions are therefore hoped by the state to remain silent about those opinions. If they mention their opinions, that is "propaganda," and only mentioning opinions that the state considers correct is considered proper teaching. As a result, studious and thoughtful young people often cannot correctly recognize the outstanding ideas of the time after leaving the classroom. Rather, in the subject of civics, the purpose of teaching is more to lead people into a fog. The political knowledge imparted to young people is the self-evident platitudes of politics, while all the realities of actual politics are deliberately concealed. When young people grow up and discover the true inside story, it is very easy to create a cynical phenomenon, and all social ideals are lost. If they were initially taught the truth and given appropriate explanations, they might be able to become energetic and dare to challenge all evils, instead of just shrugging their shoulders and tacitly acquiescing to their existence, as they do now.

Enlightening falsehood becomes an unbreakable evil for those who establish educational systems. I believe that a person must be determined not to obliterate the truth in their teaching in order to become a good teacher. The morality produced by concealing the truth is fragile in itself and will fail when it touches reality. It is often thought that understanding the truth of the facts is enough to lead people to cynicism, but this process is sudden. But if it is gradually understood, and at the same time it is understood what is good, and scientific research is undertaken to understand the truth due to the impulse to gain the truth, then there will be no adverse results. In short, lying to young people without the ability to distinguish is a morally indefensible crime.

If we want democracy to exist, the most important thing a teacher can do for their students is to develop an attitude of tolerance towards those who disagree with us. This may be a natural human impulse to feel fear and disgust for all habits and customs that are different from our own. Ants and savages often put foreigners to death. Those who have never traveled abroad or had spiritual contact with foreign countries find it difficult to tolerate the strange actions and beliefs of those belonging to another country, another era, another religion, or another political party. This intolerant attitude stemming from ignorance is in opposition to the future of civilization and is the most serious danger to our densely populated world.

The education system should correct this, but the current education system does very little in this regard. In every country, national sentiment is encouraged, and students are made to believe that people in other countries are morally and intellectually inferior to their own. The most insane and malicious collective neurosis in human emotions is not prohibited, but rather encouraged. At the same time, young people are made to believe unquestioningly in this irrational thing. Teachers are not to blame for all of this because they do not have the freedom to teach what they aspire to in their hearts. They deeply understand the needs of young people, and they are in constant contact with young people, but they have no say in deciding what should be taught and what methods should be used to teach. For this reason, I believe that education should have more freedom than it currently enjoys.

Teachers, like artists, philosophers, and writers, can only fully fulfill their mission when they are directly driven by their personal creative impulses and are not controlled and bound by the outside world. However, in the modern world, there is no room for individual existence. Individuals can appear at the top as dictators in totalitarian countries or as wealthy people in industrialized countries, but in the field of knowledge, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain independent survival outside the organizational forces that control modern life. If the world does not want to lose its most valuable intellect, then it should disregard organizational forces and find ways to allow them to have room for free activity. This means that those who have power and understand that freedom should be granted to certain people should think deeply and restrain their power. The popes of the Renaissance had this awareness of the artists of the Renaissance, but contemporary authorities seem to lack respect for special talents. Perhaps we will have to wait until more peaceful times arrive before the demands of civilization can overcome the demands of party spirit. At the same time, some people should understand that the achievements of organizations are extremely limited. Every system should allow for flexibility, otherwise, it will inevitably cause the best of human nature to tend towards disintegration.

### Children's Weekly How to Read Books in the Library Yang Chunlu

If your school has a complete library, that is your supreme happiness. Because the library is a treasure trove of knowledge, where many valuable books are hidden, available for us to borrow and read, to supplement the lack of textbooks.

But how do we use the library? When we go to the library to borrow books, we must first browse the book catalog, choose the books we like to read, fill out a borrowing slip, indicating our name, the name of the book borrowed, the number, the borrowing date, etc., and then borrow the book from the librarian.

When reading, you must be single-minded, have a beginning and an end, in order to benefit. It is best to take notes at any time; notes can help our memory and increase our insights.

After reading, return the book to the librarian and retrieve the borrowing slip. The period for borrowing books to read outside the library is generally limited, usually to one week. If you have not finished reading by the expiration date, you must renew the loan with the librarian. If you return the book overdue, you will be penalized.

You don't need any formalities to read newspapers. But after reading, you must return them to their original place.

Also, here are a few things to keep in mind when reading in the library:

1.  You must abide by all the rules of the library and follow the guidance of the librarian.

2.  Walk lightly when entering and exiting; moving chairs should not make loud noises either.

3.  When reading, sit upright with your back straight.

4.  Do not read two books at the same time.

5.  In the library, do not read aloud, let alone talk, laugh, or argue.

6.  Do not use saliva to turn pages or fold the corners of the book, and do not scribble on or tear up books; if there is any damage, you must compensate at the price.

Dear children! If you want to increase your knowledge, you should often go to that "treasure trove of knowledge"!

### The Reason for Falling Leaves Jin Jian

A gust of autumn wind and a burst of rain blew the remaining hot steam of the hot summer to a distant place, and the cool air replaced the area of hot air, and the creatures on the ground ushered in another change—the sound of cicadas stopped, and the autumn insects' drums folded their wings; people added a piece of clothing to their thin clothes; the lush trees were dyed with a layer of declining yellow color; and even old yellow leaves, unable to withstand the wind and rain, fluttered from their old home and fell to the ground. This scene of change certainly shows that autumn has long arrived. Ah Ming certainly felt the coolness of autumn. Seeing the leaves falling slowly from the trees in the courtyard, he intentionally asked Ah Hui jokingly, "Why do leaves turn yellow and fall in autumn?"

"What's so much to ask! Because once autumn arrives, the leaves on the trees will definitely fall, this is a natural phenomenon," Ah Hui replied, seemingly laughing at her brother's stupidity.

"I know that leaves fall in autumn, what is the reason for that?" Ah Ming asked further, and Ah Hui was really unable to answer, and wanted to take this opportunity to go to the kitchen, but was stopped by Ah Ming.

"It doesn't matter if you don't understand this, but don't leave. I can tell you and give you a satisfactory answer. Indeed, this question is not easy to answer. After autumn, the leaves turn yellow and wither, it seems that the leaves have completed their mission to the trees from spring to summer to autumn, and they can gradually wither. The dead leaves are of no benefit to the trees, so it doesn't matter if they fall. This statement is not wrong, but it is too unrealistic. We must first know what position the leaves occupy in the life history of trees? We must know that the leaves are the organs for trees to manufacture nutrients. They absorb oxygen and carbon dioxide from the air, and absorb water from the ground from the roots. These three raw materials are gathered on the leaves, and the leaves also contain chlorophyll, which is a machine for photosynthesis, and then uses the original power of sunlight, so that nutrients are made. This effect mostly occurs most frequently in spring and summer. After the nutrients are made, they must be transported to the roots and trunks, which all occurs in autumn. Some of the manufactured nutrients are stored in the roots and stems, and some are decomposed and utilized. When decomposed, a kind of energy is produced, which is obtained by absorbing sunlight, and the development and growth of trees requires energy. Therefore, spring is the period for making nutrients, autumn is the period for decomposing and transporting nutrients, and summer has several effects. The waste products of decomposition are also excreted from the leaves to the outside of the trunk, so the leaves are the place for manufacturing nutrients and excreting waste products, which is very important for trees. The reason for the falling leaves is to save the trees from useless consumption, and to store the nutrients for the lushness of the coming spring, so the falling leaves are entirely an exercise in frugality by the trees!"

### Min'er No Longer Loves Crickets Wang Cangping

Crickets are our heroic warriors. Last autumn, Min'er raised several brave and good-at-war crickets, and pasted the titles of Ever-Victorious General and Invincible General on each clay pot. He carefully raised them at all times, and valued them very much. By the end of autumn and the beginning of winter, when the weather became colder and colder, these majestic generals could not resist the cold attacks, and their actions became sluggish at the same time; their calls were also weak and powerless. This kind of performance was no different from sending a cry for pity to Min'er. Min'er was certainly anxious, and hurriedly asked his mother for a lot of new cotton, and carefully spread it at the bottom of the clay pots, but the weak little lives still could not withstand the torment of the cold air, and died successively within a few days. After Min'er's sadness, he had to bury them.

This year, Min'er is already twelve years old, and his knowledge and concepts have made great progress with age. He accurately feels that there are more brave and meaningful warriors than crickets. Therefore, this year's Min'er deeply feels that the heart that loves crickets should be moved entirely.

It is now autumn wind, and the newspaper carries the collection of winter clothes. Min'er happily sent the two yuan he had saved to be used as a donation.

### Biography of Shirley Temple (15) Min

"Cogan, listen, this is how I got such a good opportunity. One day, Mom asked Mr. George Wade to produce a film called 'Shame' for Elks Company, which required many little girls to perform singing and dancing programs. We received a phone call from his office and rushed there. At that time, there were more than three hundred girls, accompanied by their mothers or agents, who had already registered, so we couldn't get close to Mr. Wade. Mom was disappointed. But then a gentleman walked up to us, said to be the director, named Leo Hawk. He told Mom that he had seen 'Baby Take a Bow' before, so he recognized me as soon as he saw me. He said my past achievements were very good, and he would definitely help me in the future. He also told Mom that there might not be too much disappointment in Mr. Wade's film 'Shame'. This summons was just to test how many people would respond when they decided they needed little girls; but now it hasn't been decided yet. Finally, Mr. Hawk said that they would soon be making other films, and maybe they would need a girl like me, and then he would find a way for me. At the same time, he also wanted to see the 'Kid's Toys' movie to see how I performed.

One evening, my parents and I went to a movie theater in Beverly Hills to see a preview of the second part of "Kid's Toys." Mr. Hawk also came as expected; with him was a song writer named Mr. Conan. According to Mr. Conan, Mr. Will Rogers recently had a plan to produce a great musical film, with Mr. Sheehan as the producer, inviting Warner Baxter, Meg Evans, John Bowers, and Jamie Dunn to co-star, which had already been decided. This film also requires a little girl to play the daughter of Jamie Dunn, the position is not very important, but it also requires a smart and clever child to join this strong line. He told Mom that if she took me to the studio tomorrow, he could introduce me to Mr. Liu Bairang, who is helping Mr. Sheehan with the production and composition. He said that meeting Mr. Bairang was also a good thing, because he was the one who discovered Jack Cooper, and Jack became famous because of it. This time he might 'discover' me." We all laughed when we heard this; Dad laughed even harder, saying that Columbus, who discovered America, was a pity to be dead, otherwise he might have "discovered" me long ago.

The next day, we met Mr. Liu Bairang in the studio. Mom sat there just smiling. Mr. Hawk and Mr. Conan told Mr. Bairang about the films I had starred in before. Then Mr. Bairang said to me, "Shirley, let's see what your skills are." So someone played the "St. Louis Blues" on the piano, and I danced according to the rhythm, and imitated the style of Rodney Wanley singing on the radio a few days ago, and sang in a low voice. He was very surprised after watching it, and said immediately: "It's decided!" He was willing to sign a contract with me and assign me the role of that little daughter in the film. Sure enough, Mr. Liu Bairang "discovered" me!

### Several Problems in Elementary School Students' Compositions Meng Bai

Due to my years of teaching Chinese in elementary schools, I have observed that most elementary school students make the following mistakes in composition class:

(1) Unwilling to Think Carefully When a topic is given, stupid students complain that it is difficult to do, and smart students can actually write something, but they are unwilling to put their heart into it. They just want to fill a few lines and hand in their papers, regardless of whether the content is well written or not.

(2) Handwriting Too Cursive Lately, most elementary school students are not very good at writing. In composition books, the words are mostly written in cursive. It's like their hearts. It's best to use a pencil or fountain pen to write, and they are most afraid of writing with a brush. In fact, you should write regular script in composition books.

(3) Like to Write Simplified Characters Even regular script is not well written, but they specialize in liking to write cursive or simplified characters, and even write them in a mess. When new teachers mark papers, they can't see what the words are. The so-called learn to run before you learn to walk, and you will never be able to write well again!

(4) Often Need to Revise Most elementary school students are too lazy to use draft paper for composition. If you can write straight down without using a draft, it is also okay. But they often write wrongly and arbitrarily revise the composition book, filling the blank line with words, so that the teacher has no place to write when grading.

(5) Unable to Distinguish Subject and Object Some elementary school students cannot distinguish the subject and object of each paragraph and each sentence. In fact, each paragraph and each sentence has a subject and object. Even if he or you is used in the previous sentence, they or you is used in the next sentence. Errors like this can often be found.

Anyone knows that if you make the above mistakes in composition, you will never progress. What's more, there are many other mistakes besides the above. Therefore, I hope that elementary school students in general can correct these mistakes in order to make progress in composition.

### X-Rays in the Entertainment Industry Hua Zhi

Although the invention of film art has only been a few short decades, it has made great progress, such as changing from silent to sound, from monochrome to color, and from flat to three-dimensional, which can be described as extremely pleasing to the senses. Recently, what is being tested is to change from odorless to odorous, that is, the so-called "olfactory film"; the father has no need for film, using radio transmission. All this is already well-known, and what is coming one after another is the "transparent film", that is, X-ray shadow play, which is rarely mentioned.

It turns out that the invention of high-speed X-ray photography can photograph the movement of objects in one-hundredth of a second, penetrating the internal organization of objects. Mr. Slack, a technician at a certain industrial college in Westinghouse, USA, has recently achieved preliminary success in using X-rays to manufacture special light tubes. When it is installed under the lens, it creates a strange image through the surface and inside of the object.

This novel invention is being actively tested, and the content is extremely secret, but Hollywood producers have long been waiting, preparing to invest in the purchase of its production rights. Generally speaking, X-ray shadow plays are complicated to shoot, and the performance time will not be very long. Unless there are special programs, such as wonderful football, tennis, and golf matches, which can use slow motion to show the ball's progress. What is even more amazing is when the army and navy practice, how the cannon explodes from the barrel and rushes out of the muzzle, how the machine gun bullets travel in the air, and even how the grenades explode, X-ray shadow plays can clearly show them. The current shadow plays only show a wisp of white smoke and a loud noise when opening the gun. This is mostly disguised, which is very different from this.

In short, X-ray shadow plays will be of great help for shooting war films, monster films, or science adventure films. To what extent it will develop, we can only wait and see.

### Overseas Entertainment News Yong

(1) Recently, the Berlin authorities screened several newsreels at a banquet to entertain foreign journalists. The films introduced the dynamics of German aircraft when they entered Rotterdam, the first commercial port of the Netherlands. After the banquet, an American journalist told people: "I couldn't see a single house in the Rotterdam area being damaged by the bombing in the picture." But later, according to the Reuters transmission, "The death of the people and the ravage of the city caused by the German aircraft bombing cannot be described in words or ink." From this, we can recognize that the sole purpose of German newsreels is to use them as propaganda tools. What they show is by no means a true news.

(2) Oxford University is the highest institution in the United Kingdom. Two months ago, male and female students under the age of twenty-one from the university borrowed one of the most famous theaters in London to perform a play to raise funds for a certain French relief association in England. The script of the play was called "Under Twenty-one."

(3) Paramount's newsreels will soon no longer be allowed to be screened in cinemas throughout Japan, according to an announcement by Tokyo officials. It is reported that this order must be implemented in the autumn of this year; thereafter, the newsreels on Japanese screens will be supplied entirely by companies organized by Japanese film merchants, and newsreels distributed by foreign merchants will be banned. (Note: Paramount's Shanghai authorities have not yet received a report on this news, so it has not yet been officially recognized.)

(4) Since the outbreak of the war, the United Kingdom has tried its best to increase the amount of various taxes. Recently, the cinema industry has also received a notice from the country's Ministry of Finance that a large part of their business must be used as the country's financial resources to cope with emergencies; for this reason, national film merchants have now decided to take the only way to raise ticket prices. This phenomenon can be said to be unprecedented in the history of the British film industry.

### "Sea Hero" Cast A Collection of Actors from Various Lei Film Companies A Gala Performance at the Majestic Theatre on Friday Evening He Ken

A Collection of Actors from Various Lei Film Companies A Gala Performance at the Majestic Theatre on Friday Evening

"Sea Hero," co-directed by Wei Ruhui and Wu Yonggang, is the sequel to "Ge Nen Niang," depicting the heroic leap of Zheng Chenggong going to Taiwan to start an uprising after the second act. Since the establishment of the "New Art Theatre Company," Wei Ruhui has been engaged in the writing of this four-act tragedy. Six drafts have been revised in half a year, and the entire script was completed last month.

The "New Art Theatre Company" is organized by a collection of actors from various film companies. After receiving the mimeographed version, the AB system rehearsal was divided (probably conflicting with the company's filming work). On the one hand, the person in charge began to contact the performance site. The Carlton, which was rumored to be the ideal location at the earliest, did not succeed due to some reason. Therefore, it still cooperated with the Majestic Theatre, the memorial site of "Ge Nen Niang," and performed continuously for a week from the gala performance on the 27th (Friday).

The cast of "Sea Hero" is: Emperor Longwu (Sima Yingcai), Empress Zeng (Ding Zhi), Zheng Zhilong (Xu Li, Pei Chong, He Bin), Zheng Chenggong (Liu Qiong), Cang'er (Zhu Jiping), Guo Bichang (Tu Guangqi), Dong—Cheng Gong's wife (Shen Hao, Gu Lanjun), Bolo (Zhou Qi, Xi Meng, Zhang Zhizhi), Zheng Jing—Cheng Gong's son (Qian Yi), Zhang Mingzhen (Shu Shi), Zheng Yu—Cheng Gong's daughter Chen Qi), Ma Jinzi (Yan Fei)... The total number of actors is more than seventy, which is only seen after "Roar, China."

### Remembering Chen Delin's Disciples Plum Blossom Pavilion Master

Reading the notes of Mr. Bingjiu Weiwei on the "Wang's Disciples" for several days, all the sections involving Chen Delin's disciples are incorrect. In the Bingjiu supplement on the 22nd, it said, "Although Wang (Huifang), Jiang (Miaoxiang), Mei (Lanfang), and Shang (Xiaoyun) are called Delin's disciples, they have not paid respect to him as a teacher. Delin's true disciple is only Wang Qinnong." This is also incorrect. According to Shitou's lifetime collection of students, there were a total of nine people. Those who entered the door in the early years of the Republic of China were Wang Yaoqing, Wang Qinnong, Wang Huifang, Mei Lanfang, Jiang Miaoxiang, and Yao Yufu (the above six people and their teacher once took a photo together, the teacher sat in the middle, and the six disciples stood apart in the back. This photo was enlarged by Lanfang in the photo studio and entrusted to a certain artist to make robes and jackets from silk and stick them on the photo, which looked quite realistic from a distance. This photo was made and jointly sent to the teacher by the six disciples as a permanent memorial, and the photo is still hanging in Shitou's hall.) Those who continued to be recruited after the tenth year of the Republic of China were Jiang Junjia and Huang Guiqiu. In his later years, he also recruited a Kun Opera famous actress, Ms. Han Qing (Shichang). After Ms. Han Qing, the door was closed from then on.

Master Cheng Yanqiu, the owner of Yushuang Studio, also often asked Shitou for advice. Shitou was very fond of Yanqiu, and would explain everything in detail when asked. Therefore, Yanqiu can also be regarded as one of Chen's direct disciples.

### The Last Home of the Dancer in the Hawthorne Detective Case Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 7 "Take Him Away"

Hawthorne didn't answer, suddenly poked his head out and looked towards the turn, then immediately turned back. My heart was also pounding wildly. It turned out that the last time we were talking here, the swaggering person was Zhao Boxiong, who was the one who shot Hawthorne. With the development of this case, it seems to have gone from complicated to simple, and from suspense to tension.

Hawthorne asked in a low voice, "Where did you see him?"

A Gen also said in a low voice, "Right here - on the fifth floor." He pointed his hand to the lower floor. "Just now I went to the fifth floor to find Xiao Li, and suddenly saw this person. At first, I didn't pay attention. Unexpectedly, after he walked past me, he turned his head and stared at me, which made me remember that I had also seen him when I was talking with you near No. 776. When I thought about it again, I recognized that this person was the Qian who lived in No. 774."

"How did you recognize him?"

"His jaw is particularly square and wide, and his eyes are a little scary. This is what I am used to seeing; and his body is also equally tall. But at that time,

### U.S. Entire Fleet to Return to Hawaii Periodically; Split into Three Teams to Patrol West Coast; Pacific Naval Strength Undiminished

Washington – Secretary of the Navy Knox stated last night, after reporting on Anglo-American talks to understand the "police responsibility" of the United States in the Pacific, that the entire U.S. fleet would return to Hawaii on January 1 next year. It is reported that this fleet will be divided into three teams to patrol the west coast of the United States, so that the naval strength in the Central Pacific will not be reduced to less than two-thirds of its normal strength at any time. Each fleet will also stay on the west coast for two weeks, so that crew members can be given leave to return home, and ships can be repaired slightly. One team has already set off for California. Secretary Knox's remarks last night are indeed worthy of attention, as what he said is completely consistent with what has been revealed in the Washington Anglo-American talks on Pacific issues. The situation in the Pacific has been discussed by Secretary of State Hull, British Ambassador Lord Lothian, and Australian Minister Casey for three weeks. Furthermore, according to reports from various newspapers here, the Navy Department has ordered the U.S. Asiatic Fleet to assemble in the Philippines and ordered all ships stationed in Japanese-controlled waters to withdraw. However, according to Hull's statement to reporters yesterday, he had not heard a word about the concentration of the Asiatic Fleet, only seeing it in the newspapers. The Navy Department indicated that the movement of the Asiatic Fleet was purely routine, with southern patrols often conducted every autumn. (United Press dispatch from the 21st)

Plan for Separate Defense of Two Oceans; Anglo-American Agreement in Principle Reached

London – Authoritative circles announced last night that the United States and Britain have held several historic meetings in Washington in the past few days. Authoritative circles claimed that this discussion not only involved the Singapore naval base but also reviewed all issues thoroughly. This move is believed to have been prompted by Japan's actions in Vietnam and concerns that Japan might soon attack the Dutch East Indies. The talks in Washington may have a significant impact on whether Britain decides to open the Burma Road after October 18. Britain seems to be trying to avoid conflict with Japan, but well-informed circles here believe that the talks in Washington will improve the hope of American aid to Britain. American officials stated that the talks in Washington included a plan for the United States to defend the Pacific and Britain to patrol the Atlantic. It is reported that an agreement in principle has been reached on this matter. (United Press dispatch from the 21st)

London – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that regarding the claim that Britain will allow the Singapore naval base to provide certain facilities to the United States, authoritative sources in London now claim that the United States and Britain, which have common interests in the Far East, have been adopting parallel policies for many years. On this basis, the facilities that Britain can allow the United States to use can be made available to the United States as needed by the development of the situation in the Far East. This has been the case for many years and will continue to be so in the future. (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)

U.S. Will Not Sit Idly By If Dutch East Indies Are Invaded; Relations with Japan Exceptionally Tense

Washington – Senator Elbert D. Thomas of the Foreign Relations Committee, stated here last night that if Japan invades the Dutch East Indies, the United States may use force to confront it. Although the United States opposes Japan's aggressive actions in Annam, it is more difficult to implement restraints. The Dutch East Indies is clearly a pivotal point of interest for the United States, and its relationship is extremely important. If Japan takes any action against it, the United States cannot remain indifferent. He said, "We would be utter fools if we allowed Japan to do as it pleases. I firmly believe that if the Dutch East Indies is threatened, the United States will take appropriate action." When commenting on the Japanese Imperial Conference's decision this week to pursue a policy of southward expansion, Senator Thomas said that he did not believe the Japanese navy would challenge the American fleet. He believes that even if such a development occurs, it may take the form of the current situation in the Mediterranean, where the British fleet patrols everywhere, while the Italian navy remains deep in port, its traces often far away on distant shores. He has not received notice of the details of the Anglo-American talks regarding the use of the Singapore naval base by the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands, but he strongly supports the idea of the American fleet gaining access to Singapore. He concluded, "Our interests are intertwined with those of Britain, so we must cooperate with Britain. Moreover, outside the Western Hemisphere, Britain is our only friend, and the United States should naturally take cooperative action with it." (United Press dispatch from the 21st)

Washington – As the situation in the Far East teeters on the brink of danger and relations between the U.S. and Japan become increasingly strained, the eyes of Washington officialdom are focused today on the following reports: 1. Negotiations between the Vietnamese authorities and the Japanese have broken down. 2. The U.S. fleet may use Singapore as a base. 3. If necessary, to prevent Japan from invading Vietnam. Secretary of State Hull, amid the serious atmosphere of reports of Japanese residents evacuating Vietnam, indicated yesterday that the U.S. fleet may use Singapore as its base. At the same time, well-informed observers said that several administrative leaders have begun to take active steps, advocating that the occupation of Vietnam by Japanese troops should be prevented. Hull said that the State Department is still exchanging detailed and candid information on the Far East with Britain and Australia. Although Hull indicated that the U.S. fleet may use the Singapore base, he also said that the U.S. government has not yet made any decisions on this matter. However, International News Service has obtained reliable information that Britain has fully expressed its approval of the U.S. fleet using the Singapore base. According to those close to Hull, relations between the U.S. and Japan are now exceptionally serious, and today's situation is vastly different from the previous situation between the two countries. Senior U.S. naval commanders, in view of Britain's situation in Europe and its "collapse" in the Far East, are working to obtain a firm position and have warned the government that further expansion of Japanese territory is dangerous.

### To Prevent Japanese Southward Advance, Only by Intensifying Aid to China; U.S. Army Officer, New Zealand Writer Give Speeches in Philippines, Praising China's New National Spirit

Manila – Major Carlson, formerly of the Navy and recently a U.S. military observer in China, and Bertram, a New Zealand author and journalist, both spoke at the University of the Philippines' Villamor Hall, advocating that foreign countries should provide China with all kinds of aid except for participating in the war, in order to contain Japan and prevent it from implementing its southward expansion plan. Carlson said that Japan wants to occupy the Philippines after the United States leaves. Carlson praised the new national spirit of China, the determination of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese people to resist Japan, and described the achievements of the Chinese Eighth Route Army in laudatory terms, saying that if China can be properly aided, it will definitely win the final victory. If Japan benefits, the Philippines and the United States will both suffer. He does not support any appeasement policy. Bertram said that Japan's war in China is the prelude to Japan's conquest of Australia. He advocated cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East. This speech was initiated by the Philippine-China Industrial Cooperation Association, and the audience was composed of members of the Philippine elite. Mrs. Sayre, the U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, also attended the lecture. (United Press dispatch from the 21st)

### British Aid to China Committee Sends Letter to Prime Minister, Urging Opening of Burma Road

London – The Aid China Committee sent a letter to Prime Minister Churchill, stating that 1.3 million people in Britain have notified the committee that they are willing to support the immediate and unconditional opening of the Burma Road. The letter said that the current movement was organized at a very difficult time, with many problems arising in various aspects of transportation. The response from all parties is sufficient to demonstrate the strength of British public opinion on this issue. All are willing for their government not to prevent the Chinese people from using the vital road for continued resistance. (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)

### European Officers Among Japanese Troops in Shenzhen

Hong Kong – As the Japanese troops in South China continue to increase, news has been received here that European officers have recently been seen among the Japanese troops in Shenzhen. Chinese farmers arriving in Kowloon have informed foreigners in Kowloon that they have seen Westerners in uniform among the Japanese troops stationed in Shenzhen. The authorities here believe that these European officers may be Italians or Germans. It is rumored that they are military advisors or liaison officers attached to the Japanese army, acting as scouts. It is also rumored that these European officers arrived in Shenzhen by plane from Shanghai via Guangzhou, so the Hong Kong military authorities are very concerned about them and are currently investigating. It is unknown whether there are Germans or Italians in Shenzhen. In view of the urgency of the situation in Vietnam and the gradual extension of the European war to British spheres of influence, the Hong Kong authorities are now doing everything possible to find out what these officers are up to. It is rumored that the Japanese army, in order to take action in Vietnam, has recently dispatched elite troops to the Shenzhen camp. The troops of Long Jintian (transliteration), originally stationed in Bao'an and Zhongshan, surrendered to Chongqing on September 2. Long's secret agents are currently active outside, seeking to persuade other troops to surrender to the National Government of China. The Japanese army seems to have abandoned its plan to advance north along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, as Chinese heavy troops are now stationed near Huizhou and Danshui. In short, the war in Guangdong Province is currently at a standstill. (International News Service dispatch from the 21st)

Chongqing – The organization of savings groups is an important task of the current stage of the thrift and savings movement. It is observed that the two committees on savings have been dispatching section chiefs, commissioners, and staff to various agencies and organizations in recent days to discuss the establishment of groups, and satisfactory results have been largely obtained.

Among them, the Central Bank of China, under the careful planning of group leader Chen Xing, organized savings groups consisting of 32 sub-groups and 70 branch groups in a short period of time by utilizing the bank's existing bureaus, offices, and local branch offices. The original target for savings and fundraising for the group was 3 million yuan. After organization and allocation, the amount of savings pledged has exceeded the original target. The amount of savings that group members will raise from relatives and friends in the future will be even more considerable, which is truly a gratifying phenomenon. (Dispatch from the 21st)

Berlin – According to information gathered by a Haitong News Agency reporter from well-informed sources here, the first meeting between Italian Premier Mussolini and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at the Palazzo Venezia in Rome has resulted in important decisions.

Officials here declined to disclose the results of the talks in Rome, but German newspapers have begun to discuss the status of Spain. According to Dr. Halffeld, a well-informed expert, Spain has recently transformed from a neutral country to a non-belligerent country and may decide to assist the Axis powers based on its interests and political ideals. The new order in Europe is closely related to the new order in the Mediterranean and Africa. The Rome talks have great significance. (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 21st)

A Berlin dispatch from the Alcázar newspaper said that Serrano Suñer and Ribbentrop will meet again, the sole purpose of which is to sign a commercial treaty that has been under discussion for a long time. The conclusion of this treaty is a natural result of the greatly expanded trade possibilities between Germany and Spain after the collapse of France. (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)

Madrid – Spanish newspapers emphasize that Interior Minister Serrano Suñer's visit to Germany has great significance, believing that after Serrano Suñer met with Hitler and his confidants, the German government understood Spain's wishes during this period of historical transformation in Europe.
