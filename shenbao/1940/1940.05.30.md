### Large-Scale Mountain Warfare Unfolds Between Dahong Mountain and Tongbai Mountain. Japanese Troops Retreating from Zhaoyang Suffer Interception on the Northern Slopes of Dahong Mountain. Communication Between Guangshui and Xinyang is Completely Controlled by the Chinese.

Since the Chinese forces in northern Hubei, Fancheng, adopted new strategies, significant developments have been achieved. On the Zaozhong Avenue front, according to pre-arranged plans, Chinese forces have been successively intercepting retreating Japanese troops heading south. On the 28th, near Xin Street (southwest of Zhaoyang), over two thousand Japanese soldiers were spotted retreating south. Chinese forces fiercely attacked, killing over five hundred Japanese soldiers, with the remaining troops scattering and fleeing. Due to the Xianghua Road being controlled by Chinese forces, the Japanese troops in Zhaoyang have been unable to restore it. For several days, they have been retreating south in separate groups through the mountainous areas. One route leads from Wujiadian, Xiaobanqiao, and Pinglindian (all south of Zhaoyang), while another leads from Huanglongdang and Fangjiaji (both southwest of Zhaoyang), all retreating towards the northern slopes of Dahong Mountain. They have been intercepted and severely damaged by Chinese forces. A large-scale mountain war is currently unfolding intensely. On the Xianghua Road front, Chinese forces are intercepting passing Japanese troops, achieving significant victories while also employing extremely skillful tactics to deeply encircle newly arrived Japanese troops. The area from Zhaoyang to the Tangbai River is being used as a place to continue eliminating the remaining Japanese forces. The progress made is extremely smooth, and the complete annihilation of the Japanese troops is imminent. (29th Dispatch)

On the morning of the 22nd, Chinese forces in Nanyang attacked Jigong Mountain again, killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers and destroying over two hundred meters of railway tracks. Another unit stormed the Xindian railway station, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese, and destroyed several Japanese warehouses and barracks. Simultaneously, over two thousand meters of railway between Lijiazhai and Donghuangdian was also destroyed by Chinese forces. Currently, transportation between Guangshui and Xinyang is completely under Chinese control. (29th Dispatch)

For several days, large-scale mobile warfare has been occurring between Chinese and Japanese forces north of Dahong Mountain, south of Fancheng and Zhaoyang. Five thousand Japanese troops retreating south from Zhaoyang were cut off by Chinese forces on the 26th at Zishan and Qingtan. On the 27th, Chinese forces encircled the Japanese troops near Xiaobanqiao and Pinglindian, wiping them out overnight, killing over eight hundred Japanese soldiers. Another group of five to six hundred Japanese soldiers, including infantry and cavalry, accompanied by several artillery pieces, advanced south from Taojiaji and Shasha Dian towards Zhangjiaji on the 27th, engaging in fierce fighting with strong Chinese forces. The battle is still ongoing. On the 27th, three to four hundred Japanese soldiers set out from Tuxi in Suixian to reinforce, but were intercepted by Chinese forces. The Japanese were unable to withstand the attack and retreated in disarray. Subsequently, over a thousand Japanese soldiers reinforced from Lishan and continued fierce fighting with the Chinese in Anju until late at night. Simultaneously, over two thousand Japanese soldiers from Wujiadian, along with hundreds of packhorses, advanced on Qingtan and Maocitian. Chinese forces lured them into the dangerous terrain of Wanshan, engaging them in fierce fighting. The Japanese were caught in a desperate situation, with casualties exceeding six hundred. (28th Dispatch)

Regarding the situation in Luoyang and northern Hubei, the Japanese troops in various strongholds outside Zhaoyang are being actively pursued by Chinese forces with the determination to completely eliminate them. The remaining Japanese troops trapped in Shuangqiao, besieged by Chinese forces, lost their way and broke out to the west on the morning of the 27th, attempting to escape by crossing the river. Chinese forces waited until they were halfway across before launching a fierce attack. The Japanese troops fell into the water, suffering heavy casualties. The remaining Japanese troops retreated along their original route, and the Chinese forces are actively pursuing them. (28th Dispatch)

On the 21st, Chinese forces in southern Henan, Fancheng, recovered Chenjiaqiao, killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers. They then attacked the Japanese troops in Wangjiadian and Miaotaizi, destroying two Japanese trains with landmines and killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers. (8th Dispatch)

After the brave resistance of the Chinese forces, the Japanese failed to achieve their goals. This morning, a portion of the Japanese troops launched a fierce attack towards the southwest, attempting to break through and retreat.

### King's Surrender and the Outlook for the European War

After eighteen days of hard fighting alongside the British and French allied forces, King Leopold III, also the commander-in-chief of the Belgian army, suddenly accepted Germany's terms without the government's consent and ordered a ceasefire. The shocking news has shaken the world. This is another noteworthy page in the current European war since the hasty escape of the Polish government last autumn! Regardless of the rights and wrongs of the overall European war situation, let us make an objective review of the impact on Belgium and the war situation.

Belgium, as a small country that has been established for only a little over a hundred years, has suffered the tragedy of being overrun by foreign powers twice in twenty-five years. Its circumstances and situation are indeed worthy of sympathy. However, in the previous European war, even though all its territory was occupied and the king was exiled, the determination of the military and civilians never wavered, and they were able to regain their territory after five years of hard fighting. The strength and grandeur of the late King Albert I, and his glorious achievements, are still admired by the world, forming a model of defending the country with hardship and never surrendering. However, the current King Leopold III, as the head of state and commander-in-chief of the entire army, abandoned his oath at a critical moment, abandoned his allied forces who were in the same boat, and disregarded the country's past honor and future well-being. He suddenly took the action of a separate ceasefire and surrender, causing his enemies to become arrogant and his allies to suffer a major blow. In this case, this is truly disloyal, unjust, cowardly, and shameless. He has been spurned by his own people and has isolated himself from the country. This is not only contemptible but also sad! Of course, Belgium's sacrifice this time has been far more severe than the previous time, and the German offensive has also been more fierce than in the past. However, from any point of view, there is no reason to forgive this kind of despicable and treacherous behavior.

Belgium is a constitutional country. Although the king is the head of state, the major policies of politics, war, and peace can only be decided by the government and the people's representatives. The king has no such power. On the other hand, although the King also serves as commander-in-chief, military advances and retreats are still subject to the control of the government's military command. Now, this king has stopped the war and surrendered without the government's consent, which is unconstitutional in terms of law and disobedient in terms of military discipline. Even if his troops are forced to implement the ceasefire, it can only be regarded as being affected by the King's personal actions, and Leopold himself is just a surrendered king who betrayed his country. From now on, only the cabinet and parliament that exist according to the constitution can truly represent the country of Belgium. Therefore, people will no longer confuse this king with Belgium.

However, this development is not just the King's business, nor is it just Belgium's business. It undeniably increases the seriousness of the British and French allied forces in the current stage. First, the allied forces in the Flanders region are already in an unfavorable situation. Now that the Belgian army's left flank has collapsed, the German army will easily advance directly to the coast from Bruges, completing the encirclement of the allied forces. Second, from the 10th to the 21st of this month, the German offensive focused on advancing along the Aisne River to the outskirts of Paris. After the 21st, they suddenly used their full strength to rush straight to the coast of the English Channel. If the allied forces in the Flanders region are eventually forced to withdraw, then Germany's stronghold in the English Channel will be stabilized, increasing the threat to Britain. Third, Belgium is the most developed country in Europe in terms of heavy industry. As far back as the Napoleonic era, it relied on this as an arsenal for conquering all of Europe. Now that the Belgian king has surrendered unconditionally, the industry and mineral production will no longer be automatically destroyed, and the military needs of Germany will be strengthened. Fourth, the King's surrender has increased the difficulties of Britain and France and has also raised the arrogance of Germany. For example, Italy, whether or not to join the war, although cannot be decided immediately, will inevitably take the opportunity to intensify its demands on Britain and France. These are the four most obvious points, and the situation is sufficient to affect the future of the war. The British and French allied forces, who have been fighting extremely hard for two weeks, will face more difficulties and become more isolated in the future, and it is difficult to imagine that they will need several times the effort to fight.

Although the impact is very significant, it cannot be immediately concluded that it has a decisive effect. Look at the previous European war. At the end of 1917, Belgium, Romania, Serbia, and the two small countries of Luxembourg and Montenegro on the side of the Allied Powers were all completely occupied. Italy was defeated in consecutive battles, and Russia withdrew from the war with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. In addition, all French territory outside of the line from Verdun through Laon to the North Sea was also occupied by the German army. However, those remarkable achievements did not bring Germany the final victory. Although the German army's progress this time is more agile and fierce, viewing the German army's greatest risk, greatest sacrifice, and reckless pursuit of a quick battle and a quick decision, what is demonstrated is merely a new and sharp military strategy and tactics, but it does not prove the strength of its combat power. At present, the German army is trying its best to develop towards the English Channel, claiming that it will launch a large-scale attack on Britain, but there has been no news about naval activities for more than a month. The naval strength of Britain is by no means easy to destroy. Aerial attacks and long-range artillery bombardment are Germany's strengths. In addition, the use of the Fifth Column, the severity of the oppression that can be imposed on Britain can be imagined, but the extent of the possible "battle results" is still questionable. On the other hand, the recent German offensive has exhausted its strength, and with the French army's best efforts to deploy troops, the positions around the Aisne River have also been slightly stabilized. In the future, the miracle of the German army's crushing attack will be difficult to continue to perform. During this period, if there is any kind of surprising and unexpected event that is more serious than the King's surrender and is enough to inflict a fatal blow on Britain and France, then it would be an exception and impossible to say. I would like to reason about the overall situation with common sense: the German side's instinctual and strategic goal is to give full play to the strengths of new and sharp tactics and only seek a quick battle and a quick decision, then Britain and France only need to make the current battle situation relatively stalemate, then they can gradually alleviate the crisis. As time goes by and the situation changes, everything is possible and everything is unknown.

Examining the previous developments, various measures taken by Britain and France were either too careless or too cautious. With such small shortcomings in personnel matters, compared to Germany's deep plans, it is appropriate to repeatedly stumble and suffer losses in everything. Taking this King as an example, he had wavered in the past and wanted to place Belgium outside of European disputes. He even issued a declaration of neutrality several years ago. There is no doubt that he is afraid of Germany. The King's actions this time do not seem to be purely accidental. Also, according to the news released by the German side, the King was dissatisfied with Britain and France, thinking that the British and French troops were not as brave in combat as the Belgian army. This may be propaganda, but being too cautious is indeed an important weakness of Britain and France this time. Germany is willing to risk its life to implement a blitzkrieg strategy. Britain and France hope to last for a long time but have never taken the initiative. In contrast, the side that takes the offensive is naturally competing for the lead with greater momentum and more achievements. How the trend will develop in the future depends on the one hand on whether Germany can continue to ensure its military advantage and consolidate its large occupied areas. On the other hand, it depends on the new strategic posture of the Allied Powers and the international trends.

### Yesterday in Chongqing Another Fierce Air Battle Occurred; Chinese Air Force Shot Down a Japanese Plane; Thirty-Six Japanese Planes Attacked in Two Batches Yesterday Morning; Residents Throughout the City Were Calm and Showed No Signs of Discouragement

Chongqing Thirty-six Japanese planes attacked the outskirts of Chongqing in two batches on the morning of the 29th. The Chinese Air Force bravely engaged them, resulting in a fierce encounter. The Japanese planes indiscriminately dropped dozens of bombs in the suburbs before retreating eastward. The brave Chinese Air Force pursued them with all their might and shot down a Japanese heavy bomber over Laifengyi, which crashed east of Laifengyi. The remaining Japanese planes fled in disarray. All Chinese Air Force planes returned safely. (29th dispatch)

Chongqing Japanese planes attacked the western suburbs of Chongqing this afternoon. Chongqing University was heavily damaged by bombing, and it is reported that several students were killed. Valuable scientific instruments in the laboratories were also destroyed, but Central University is said to be unscathed. Several fires broke out in the suburbs after the attack, but the bombing was not as severe as yesterday's. The second batch of nine Japanese planes flew over Chongqing and, although they were hit by anti-aircraft fire, did not drop bombs. The third batch did not enter the city airspace. The Chinese side claims that anti-aircraft fire shot down two Japanese bombers yesterday afternoon. Yesterday's Japanese bombers attacked in three batches of thirty-six, twenty-six, and thirty-six planes, respectively, as well as several reconnaissance planes. The bombs dropped by the Japanese planes yesterday afternoon were mostly incendiary bombs, so only a few fires broke out. Some unexploded bombs remain in several locations and are being removed. A bomb also landed outside the foreign reporters' hostel, where all foreign journalists reside, but did not explode. Although Chongqing has been heavily bombed for ten days, Chinese newspapers were published as usual this morning. According to official announcements, the number of casualties from yesterday's bombing in Chongqing totaled 292, but the actual number is likely higher. After inspecting the bombed areas last night, a Reuters reporter learned that both entrances of an air raid shelter had collapsed due to the tremors, and at least 100 people were buried inside. Although rescue workers are making every effort to excavate in an attempt to save lives, the buried individuals have been underground for six hours, and the hope of escape is very slim. Several bombs fell near the Dutch embassy, but the embassy building was not damaged. According to this evening's official Chinese communique, there was no mention of shooting down any Japanese planes, only that 72 Japanese bombers attacked Chongqing city and surrounding areas, resulting in 292 deaths and injuries. After the heavy bombing ended, telephone lines were cut, and the air raid alarm was temporarily damaged. Therefore, the all-clear signal was given by striking the giant bell of an ancient temple, hanging green lights, and sending people on motorcycles to sound sirens to notify the public. Repair crews quickly set out to repair the power lines, and within two hours, telephone service was restored to all parts of the city. (Reuters, 29th dispatch)

Chongqing At 8:30 AM this morning, twenty-seven Japanese planes were spotted flying west over Mianyang. At 9:09 AM, another twenty-six Japanese planes were spotted flying west over Jingmen. An air raid alert was issued in this city at 10:25 AM, followed by an emergency alert at 11:02 AM. Japanese planes intruded into the city airspace at 11:50 AM and 12:13 PM, respectively. The Chinese Air Force and anti-aircraft artillery units launched fierce attacks. The Japanese planes then dropped bombs in the suburbs. More than 50 bombs landed on Chongqing University, causing some buildings to collapse, and only one person was injured. Many other bombs landed in the surrounding rice paddies, causing twenty to thirty casualties. (29th dispatch)

Chongqing Following yesterday's bombing of this area by a large number of Japanese planes, unofficial estimates suggest that 300 people were killed and 200 injured, most of whom were innocent civilians. The Havas News Agency building has been almost completely destroyed, and the agency's Chongqing correspondent, Ma Jushi (a Belgian), narrowly escaped death. After the Japanese planes left, rescue teams immediately went out to rescue injured residents, and engineering teams led large numbers of workers to clear the streets. The spirit of the residents throughout the city remained normal, and there were no signs of discouragement. It is said that the large number of civilian deaths and injuries resulting from yesterday's bombing was due to the fact that some pedestrians ignored the authorities' announcements and failed to evacuate in time. (Havas, 29th dispatch)

Hankou At a press conference held here this afternoon, Japanese Navy spokesman Major Okano stated that the Japanese side intends to bomb Chongqing daily until the Chinese people's spirit of resistance is broken. The spokesman admitted that Chongqing itself is not a military target, but claimed that there are many military targets and anti-aircraft artillery positions in Chongqing that must be destroyed. The spokesman concluded by guaranteeing the safety of the property of third countries. (Reuters, 29th dispatch)

Chongqing During yesterday's Japanese bombing of Chongqing, over a hundred bombs were dropped, most of which landed in the southwest of the city, destroying countless houses and killing many people. Haitong News Agency's Chongqing correspondent, Aignel, and the German News Agency's correspondent in Chongqing, Hinkel, were sheltering in an air raid shelter when a bomb landed five feet away, killing many people. They escaped death by being five feet away. (Haitong News Agency, 29th dispatch)

Chongqing During yesterday's Japanese air raid on Chongqing, several bombs fell within 100 yards of the French Embassy, causing slight tremors inside the embassy. (Havas News Agency, 29th dispatch)

Chongqing Sun Hanbing, Dean of Studies at Fudan University, and staff members, including students Chen Sishu, Wang Maoquan, Wang Wenbing, Zhu Xihua, and Liu Jingcheng, were tragically killed in the bombing on the afternoon of the 27th. Sun was from Nanhui, Jiangsu, 39 years old, with a master's degree from Harvard University and a bachelor's degree from the University of Washington. After returning to China, he served as Dean of the Law School and Dean of Studies at Fudan University, Dean of the Business School at Nanda University, and professor at Zhongshan University. The renowned "Digest" bi-weekly publication was founded by Sun. Sun is survived by his wife and four children. His remains were placed in a coffin on the 28th, and President Yu, Vice President Kong, and Ambassador Shao all sent representatives to pay their respects and offer condolences. (29th dispatch)

Chongqing Today's news: During today's Japanese air raid, several bombs landed only 100 meters from the residence of the famous writer Lin Yutang, who arrived in Chongqing two days ago, but he was not harmed, which is very fortunate. Officials here were very surprised by the Japanese bombing of Fudan University because the school is far from the city of Chongqing and has no military facilities. The area near Fudan University, Beibei Town (transliteration), is a concentration area for evacuated residents and has never been attacked before. On Monday, the bombing by Japanese planes killed 500 people. (United Press, 29th dispatch)

The Presidents of Three Universities Appeal to the United States

Chongqing Ye Yuanlong, President of Chongqing University, Wu Nanxuan, President of Fudan University, and Luo Jialun, President of Central University, wrote to the American people, stating that Japanese planes are rapidly and fiercely bombing major middle schools, hospitals, and residential areas here, which is inhumane, and appealed to them to quickly impose an embargo on steel and oil exports to Japan to stop its atrocities. The text is recorded as follows: Since May 21st, Japanese planes have been wildly bombing major middle schools, hospitals, residential areas, and other areas with no military targets, often with more than 100 bombers each day, causing innocent men, women, and young students to be torn apart, their flesh and blood scattered everywhere. Most school buildings and classrooms have been reduced to rubble. These shocking scenes expose the inhumane atrocities of the Japanese. This will not frighten us but will only increase our sense of shared hatred. However, these tragic scenes are not new to us today. For three years, we have endured their trampling. Our entire nation is now making the greatest efforts to reduce the cruelty of Japanese bombing. However, the relentless display of Japanese atrocities has caused us endless sorrow. The future is long, and the flames of violence have not been extinguished. To seek timely restraint and to seize the murderous blade from the butcher's hand, we must rely on the sympathy and cooperation of your country. If Japan does not have steel and oil imported from the United States, it will not be able to continue to support its war of aggression. We hereby express our sincere intentions and deeply hope that your country can timely restrain Japan's irredeemable recklessness. As we write this letter, Japanese planes are circling overhead, and we do not know the extent to which the atrocities will continue. The language is simple and sincere because the enemy's deliberate destruction of culture has been etched into the hearts of us survivors, causing endless grief. Ye Yuanlong, President of Chongqing University, Wu Nanxuan, President of Fudan University, and Luo Jialun, President of Central University, jointly. (29th dispatch)

Washington Yesterday evening, officials at the US State Department recalled that the US government has consistently and repeatedly condemned the atrocities of bombing civilians, such as the tragic bombing of Chongqing by Japanese planes yesterday. State Department officials stated that there is no need to reiterate this policy at this time because countries that bomb civilians are already aware of the US government's attitude. According to dispatches received here, more than one thousand Chinese civilians were killed or injured and 1,500 houses were destroyed in yesterday's Japanese air raid on Chongqing. State Department officials said that the State Department has not received reports of American citizens being injured or property being destroyed. American newspapers did not give much attention to the news of the bombing of Chongqing last night because the public was focused on news of the European war. (United Press, 29th dispatch)

### On the Southern Section of the Baijin Highway, Chinese Troops Attack Yincheng and Mishan; Bagongzhen, North of Jincheng, Is Breached by Chinese Troops; Two Strongholds Southeast of Qinshui Are Reported Recaptured

Xingji Fierce battles have been raging for days on the southern section of the Baijin Highway and the areas to its right. Chinese troops are advancing on Yincheng (south of Changzhi), Taiyi (northeast of Gaoping), Sanjia (north of Gaoping), Qifoshan (east of Gaoping), Mishan Town (southeast of Gaoping), Hegang, and other places, making continuous progress.

(28th dispatch)

Luoyang On the night of the 26th, Chinese troops began a well-planned and tactful attack on the key points of Xianwengshan and Zishayao, southeast of Qinshui. At the same time, in order to prevent reinforcements from Qinshui and Zhuoshi, a large force was ambushed in the east-west areas of Xianwengshan, waiting for an opportunity to intercept. Xianwengshan and Zishayao are heavily guarded, with extremely strong fortifications such as village walls and tunnel systems. Chinese troops launched a bloody charge, engaging in a fierce battle for control. From 2 AM to the evening of the 27th, after sixteen hours of fierce fighting, many Japanese soldiers were killed, and their bodies piled up like mountains. The two locations were successively recaptured by the Chinese. Only a dozen or so Japanese soldiers escaped. During the tense battle, the Japanese troops from Qinshui and Zhuoshi did indeed come to reinforce, as the Chinese had anticipated, and were individually defeated by the Chinese using the terrain. After the Chinese captured Xianwengshan, they seized more than 2,000 bags of rice and more than 1,000 boxes of ammunition. This battle resulted in the killing of more than 860 Japanese soldiers and the destruction of more than ten tanks, making it one of the recent major victories in southeastern Shanxi. At the same time, Xianwengshan and Zishayao have always been known as dangerous locations that control the highest roads, making them points of contention between the Chinese and Japanese. Their recapture today is of great significance to the overall war situation. Currently, elite Chinese troops are advancing towards a certain location with the heroic spirit of victory. (29th dispatch)

Xingji Dozens of Japanese vehicles, fully loaded with ammunition and supplies and escorted by a unit of Japanese soldiers, were ambushed by Chinese troops on the morning of the 24th while passing near Qinchi, northwest of Yangcheng, after driving from Qinshui.

One group of Japanese troops withdrawing from south of Houma retreated to near Niuchi via Nandian, and another group retreated to Kangcun and Licun. At the same time, the Japanese in the Huanghuayu and Beiluekou areas were also defeated by the Chinese and retreated to Jishan in a panic. (28th dispatch)

Our forces were quite successful in engaging the enemy at certain locations along the Somme and Aisne Rivers. The enemy launched a sudden attack on our positions southeast of Château-Porcien (southwest of Rethel) but was repelled. There were no significant battles on the east bank of the Aisne last night." (Havas, 29th)

After the Belgian army in the north surrendered under the command of King Leopold III, a gap opened in the Allied lines. The German army seized this opportunity to launch an aggressive attack, striking the rear of the Anglo-French forces, engaging in fierce battles with British and French units in various locations. The Allied forces reorganized and redeployed yesterday to address the threat posed by the Belgian surrender. Morale has not only not been dampened but has instead become even more determined, inspiring courageous fighting, inflicting heavy losses on the German army. At the same time, Allied aircraft are actively supporting the war effort, heavily bombing German troops and rear areas, and flying to the ports of Wilhelmshaven and Hamburg to bomb various military targets, setting fire to several oil depots. The German air force is also very active, and the French port of Dunkirk is under heavy bombing, but the city has not been directly threatened. As of last night, the port of Calais was still being defended by French troops. (Havas, 29th)

The surrender of King Leopold of Belgium has increased pessimism in London about when and where the German advance can be stopped, and there are fears that the Germans will launch an attack on the British Isles from the Franco-Belgian coast soon, causing widespread anxiety. (Reuter, 29th)

The British government has decided to evacuate children from parts of Suffolk, Essex, Kent, and Norfolk within ten miles of the coast to other locations. Eight thousand children evacuated from London districts will be moved to the Midlands and south starting on Sunday. (Reuter, 29th)

German War Report

A German war report from Hitler's headquarters this afternoon states that the fate of the French forces in the Artois region has been decided. French forces south of Liege, who had been putting up a strong fight, have been defeated. British troops west of Dunkirk have also been heavily attacked by German forces and suffered significant losses. The German army is advancing rapidly in northern Flanders, having pushed past Bruges and reached Tielt. Enemy forces north of Ypres continue to fight fiercely. The German flag is flying over the German youth memorial in Langemark, where German troops fought and achieved success in 1914. Now, German troops are once again triumphant there. Before occupying Liege, the German army adopted a strategy of attacking from both east and west. The forces advancing from the west have occupied Armentières. Enemy-held positions east of Cassel have also been breached by German forces. Operations are continuing in the area of Wormhout. Dunkirk is under heavy German artillery fire. Yesterday, the German air force pursued retreating enemy forces and targeted enemy concentration points, conducting reconnaissance flights over the coasts of France and Belgium and the English Channel. German aircraft heavily damaged three destroyers, two troop transport ships, and two cargo ships. A German submarine sank an enemy submarine in the center of the North Sea. A large destroyer sailing towards England was sunk by a torpedo. Yesterday, the Allied forces lost a total of twenty-four aircraft, sixteen of which were shot down in air combat, and eight of which were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. Three German aircraft are missing. Lieutenant Molders once again achieved victory in aerial combat, bringing his total to twenty victories since the start of the war. From May 16 to 25, German anti-aircraft guns destroyed 265 enemy aircraft. In total, from May 10 to the present, German anti-aircraft guns have destroyed 607 enemy aircraft. At the same time, 101 enemy tanks have been destroyed. (Haitong Press, 29th)

Responsible sources in Berlin, speaking to a Haitong News Agency reporter, provided supplementary information to this afternoon's war report, stating that after our troops advanced to Ostend, the most important seaport on the Belgian coast fell into our hands. This port was occupied by our forces throughout World War I, from October 1914 to October 1918, serving as a submarine base. The city of Bruges, a beautiful Belgian city with ancient customs, is connected to the sea by the Zeebrugge Canal and has now been occupied by our forces. The city of Tielt, also occupied by our forces today, is famous for its linen weaving. The city of Liege, mentioned in today's war report as having been occupied by our forces, is now a French industrial center with a population of 200,000, with numerous textile mills, iron foundries, and machine shops. In addition, the city's chemical industry is also very famous. Our occupation of this city signifies that our troops have already penetrated the coal-mining region of northern France. The port of Dunkirk is currently on fire. Dunkirk is a French seaport with strong fortifications, currently serving as a base for the landing and operations of the British Expeditionary Force. Our bombardment of the port, causing it to catch fire, is intended to shatter British hopes and prevent them from finding a way to rescue the troops trapped in the country. (Haitong Press, 29th)

British Troops Retreat from Port of Boulogne Under Cover of Navy and Air Force

A naval officer in London today gave a detailed account of the British destroyers' evacuation of British troops from Boulogne amid the fires. It is reported that a demolition team composed of British sailors, Royal Marines, and a small detachment of Royal Engineers, upon receiving orders to depart within two hours, boarded several trucks and drove to the coast, boarding destroyers to sail across the Channel. Arriving at the main docks of Boulogne in the morning, a naval team was stationed at the station most convenient for directing demolition work and identified key locations to be destroyed, in preparation for carrying out the demolitions when the time came. At that time, German light mechanized units were gradually approaching Boulogne, followed by tanks and field guns mounted on trucks. German air forces were indiscriminately dropping bombs and strafing with machine guns. At one point, as many as sixty German aircraft were circling in the air. Because the city was surrounded by German troops, it was not possible to send field guns and other units to provide support, so the garrison found it difficult to defend against the German armored vehicles for long. Before long, small groups of German troops appeared in the streets outside the city, so it was decided that the British troops would retreat slightly to shorten the defensive line. After a meeting between naval and army officers, it was agreed that the city could not be defended, and with the Germans gradually closing in, it was decided to destroy all bridges and key strongholds. Upon receiving orders, the sailors carried explosives and placed them under the bridges, to be detonated after the last British troops had withdrawn. In another part of the harbor, there was a dockyard containing a naval fishing boat. The officer in charge of the demolition works decided to destroy the dockyard, the fishing boat, and the dockyard's power plant and pumping station together, to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. Just as this work was being carried out, the German troops were closing in, just four hundred yards from the dockyard. With a command, everything that could be used by the enemy was destroyed. Two British destroyers first sailed into the harbor, loaded with British troops, and then sailed away. Three more destroyers then entered the harbor in succession. At that time, German field artillery units concealed in the hills of Mont Dolent opened fire, bombarding heavily. Just as the British troops were boarding, several German heavy tanks drove from the hills to the coast to attack. The British troops defended bravely, suffering some casualties. At the same time, the destroyers vigorously returned fire at the German field artillery positions and the attacking heavy tanks beside the hill. Two German tanks were destroyed, and the rest retreated immediately. Without the swift and accurate fire from the ships, the retreating British troops would have suffered heavy losses, and the evacuation might not have been possible. (Reuter, 29th)

The Artois War Zone Expands; French Troops Establish New Defense Line in the South

Following Belgium's surrender, the swift consequence is that the new French defensive line now stretches almost continuously along the Somme River from the coast to Sedan. The Belgian army's abandonment of the Scheldt and Scarpe positions has caused France to lose the major industrial area in the north, the textile center, and the coal region of Lens, Tournai, and Anzin, which produces all of France's coal output, a key raw material for France's defense buildup. Yesterday afternoon, Lille, Armentières, Calais, Dunkirk, and Roubaix were still in French hands. However, the German area of operations in the Artois war zone has expanded to nearly one hundred kilometers. As a result, German mechanized units have been able to join up with General von Bock's forces. The Germans are now attacking from three sides. Allied forces had been advancing across the Lys River 24 hours earlier, preparing to encircle the German forces in the Artois region. Therefore, the Belgian King's surrender was a timely assistance to Germany, as the Allied forces' new commander-in-chief, General Weygand, was launching his first counter-offensive. Yesterday, General Weygand, General Gamelin, and other Allied leaders declared that they would continue fighting. Belgian officers have assured them that they will quickly conscript 500,000 brave soldiers to join the front lines. However, these troops will lack officers and substantial equipment, as the Belgian army's advanced weapons will be confiscated by Germany. At the moment, the Allied forces are extremely concerned about preserving their northern troops and their equipment and supplies. The isolated troops will not be able to be rescued. The main French line along the Somme and Aisne rivers may be in danger. The Allied forces are now focusing all their efforts on preventing the German army from breaking through the northern flank of the Maginot Line. (United Press, 29th)

Belgian Surrender Opens Highway to the Sea; Germany Exerts Terrifying Pressure on Allied Forces

British military sources stated last night in London that, in order to save the British Expeditionary Force and the French troops surrounded by German forces in Flanders, the French army must be able to launch a successful counter-offensive from the Somme River towards the German forces. British military leaders stated that the British Expeditionary Force is prepared to fight to the death in northern France, hoping to give the French army sufficient time to strengthen the new line along the Somme and Aisne rivers. Because the French army needs to consolidate the new line, the possibility of a French counter-offensive to the north is remote. (United Press, 29th)

Military sources here in Paris report that after King Leopold III of Belgium ordered a ceasefire, the war situation changed. Both sides made the necessary adjustments and deployments today. The Belgian army was originally responsible for defending the eastern flank of the Allied forces in the north. Now that they have surrendered to the German army, a large gap has appeared in that front line. However, the Allied commanders of the British and French armies are maintaining strict secrecy about what measures have been taken to remedy the situation. Encouraged by this, the German army is now increasing pressure from the northeast to the west. However, the British and French Allied forces are still fighting resolutely. At the beginning of the war, the Belgian army had a total of eighteen divisions, excluding the garrisons of the Liege and Namur forts, although two divisions were understrength. After eighteen days of hard fighting, they suffered heavy losses, especially when the German army broke through the line along the Albert Canal. Now, approximately 300,000 members of the Belgian army are surrendering to the German army in accordance with the King's orders. Naturally, this has increased the burden on the Allied forces in the north. However, the British and French air forces are focusing all their efforts on bombing German troops in this region to alleviate the pressure. (Havas, 28th)

Nazi sources in Berlin announced last night that Belgium's surrender to Germany yesterday has opened a highway to the sea for the German army. The Allied forces trapped in Flanders must either surrender or "be annihilated in a desperate battle." The German High Command stated that the German army was only seven miles from Bruges yesterday. Along the Western Front, all Allied units have been halted. The High Command reported that the German army has occupied the northern French towns of Laventie, Merville, Hazebrouck, Bailleul, Douai, and Orchies. German military sources stated that German tank units and transport vehicles can now quickly advance to the Channel. However, they also pointed out that there will be a bloody battle before the Allied forces in the northwest theater are cleared out. (United Press, 29th)

### British Air Force Sorties Over French Coast; Bombs German Rear Area Transportation; German Planes Attack Southeast Coast of England

London reports that Fleet Air Arm planes flew sorties over the French coast yesterday, destroying gun emplacements and transport columns and strafing and dispersing enemy troops. No British planes were lost. British bomber squadrons continued to attack German troops massing in northeastern France last night. Two bombers are missing. British heavy bombers continued to attack enemy transportation in the Rhineland and the border areas of Holland and Belgium all night Monday. No British planes were lost. British fighter planes achieved their best results since the invasion of Holland and Belgium on Monday, destroying or severely damaging 79 enemy aircraft, 50 of which were seen crashing. The rest were damaged and flew away. Fourteen British Hurricane and Spitfire planes are missing, but it is believed that several of the pilots are safe. British fighters patrolled the skies over the French battlefield and Belgian ports for sixteen hours. Enemy Messerschmitt fighters suffered particularly heavy losses, with 22 destroyed and nine damaged. British fighters, bombers, and reconnaissance planes are making every effort to relieve the pressure exerted by the enemy on Allied forces in France. On Monday, large squadrons of British medium bombers repeatedly bombed German rear area roads and railways. On the same night, heavy bombers attacked military targets in Dusseldorf, Duisburg, Dortmund, Hamburg, Bremen, and Cologne. All British planes returned safely. One plane shot down an enemy reconnaissance plane over Holland. Yesterday, British fighter planes continued to patrol the skies over northeastern France in poor weather. As far as is known, 22 German planes were destroyed or damaged yesterday. The Stavanger airfield was bombed again on Monday morning, and planes in the field were heavily strafed. Eight German planes in the Narvik area were destroyed or damaged by British fighter planes. Thirteen British planes have not returned. (Reuter, 29th)

German planes appeared off the coast of southeastern England yesterday, intending to bomb ships, but were met by anti-aircraft fire. The intensity of the gunfire was unprecedented on that coast. The Air Ministry announced that an air raid alert was issued in eastern Kent near noon yesterday, and the alert was lifted half an hour later. Alerts were also issued in towns twenty miles inland. (Reuter, 29th)

### Allied Forces in Norway Capture Narvik

A British War Office communiqué in London today states that Allied forces captured Narvik, Fagernes, and Falsnes in Norway last night. The struggle for the strategic military point of Narvik has been ongoing since the German invasion of Norway on April 9. (United Press, 29th)

Enemy forces in the Norwegian area, assisted by several warships, have been landing continuously and have penetrated Narvik from the north. German fighter planes attacked enemy naval forces nearby. One large battleship was hit by a bomb. In an instant, the ship was enveloped in smoke. Three cruisers, one destroyer, and two cargo ships were also hit by bombs. Many of the enemy forces who disembarked at Ankenes were injured by bombs. (Haitong Press, 29th)

### German Radio Broadcasts in French Urge French Troops to Surrender

German radio broadcast in French last night, urging French soldiers trapped in Belgium to surrender. The radio told the French soldiers: "Your fighting has been brave. You have gained enough military glory to satisfy you. If you do not stop fighting, you will only be annihilated. Do you not think of your beloved family and wives in France? Lay down your arms as soon as possible, lest you regret it later." (United Press, 29th)

### U.S. President Roosevelt Announces Creation of Special National Defense Committee; To Levy New Taxes of $30 Billion; Welles Broadcasts U.S. Defense Policy; North and South Unite Against Foreign Aggression

President Roosevelt has announced the creation of a special National Defense Committee, composed of seven prominent individuals, which will oversee the implementation of a £250,000,000 defense program. (Reuter, 29th)

President Roosevelt has appointed seven individuals to form the National Defense Committee to implement the defense program. Those appointed include Knutson Stettinius, head of General Motors, to oversee administrative matters; David Wise, Director of the Federal Reserve Board, to manage taxation; Budd, head of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, to oversee transportation; [Blank] Stetson, a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to oversee the procurement of raw materials; and Miss Inote, Dean of Women at the University of North Carolina, to serve as an advisor. This seven-member committee will hold its first meeting on Thursday. (United Press, 29th)

The government and congressional leaders agreed yesterday to levy new taxes of $30 billion over the next five years to fund defense spending. President Roosevelt has approved a plan to issue $30 billion in special national defense bonds to immediately fund defense expenses, and to levy an additional $6 billion to $7 billion in new taxes annually to redeem the national defense bonds and pay interest on them. (Reuter, 29th)

Treasury Secretary Morgenthau held a meeting with the chairmen of the Finance Committees of both Houses of Congress today, lasting three hours. During the meeting, a plan was drafted to issue $30 billion in national defense bonds and to levy an additional $6 billion to $7 billion in taxes annually over the next five years to purchase these bonds and pay interest on them. A request was also made to Congress to raise the maximum amount of national debt from $450 billion to $480 billion. This plan has been approved by President Roosevelt. (Havas, 28th)

President Roosevelt's defense program has drawn criticism from Republicans, who say it is moderate in nature and unrealistic. Former President Hoover, in a speech in New York, even argued for a single, non-partisan armaments manager to oversee the management of defense spending, and said that President Roosevelt's speech on Sunday had a partisan tone. Republican presidential candidate Dewey, speaking in Tyler, Texas, advocated for the establishment of a non-partisan National Defense Committee so that its work would not be affected by the "New Deal." He also strongly stated that the United States should not send troops to foreign battlefields. Another publisher, Garner, also a presidential candidate, even said that President Roosevelt was engaged in a sinister political blitzkrieg. Such discussions have become increasingly loud. As a result, the executive branch has had to respond with sharp rebuttals. Assistant Secretary of War Johnson, in response to these comments, declared in a national broadcast last night that the executive branch's implementation of the defense program is not based on partisan considerations, but only on the security of the nation. Any opinions offered by responsible individuals that are beneficial to the realization of the great defense goals will be considered valuable. Johnson also said that many people believe that if the United States could abolish armaments, then other countries in the world would also follow the United States and abolish military spending. From 1922 to 1933, for more than ten years, there were many people who held this view. At this point, Johnson mentioned former President Hoover's efforts in abolishing armaments, and recognized that Hoover had fallen into a mistaken understanding of the state of U.S. defense. (United Press, 29th)

U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles made a broadcast speech yesterday, stating that the United States is a country of free citizens, and that the countries of the Americas have an unusually close unity. If any non-American country attempts to attack them, the countries of the Americas will seek to deal with it in a united manner. (Haitong Press, 29th)

[Missing Location] U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles yesterday sent a warning to aggressors abroad: "Any act of aggression, whether north or south of the Equator, by a non-American Power against any American Republic will be considered a provocation to all. These nations will look upon the act of aggression as a provocation." The statement defined U.S. defense policy as including both North and South America, and the Caribbean. Observers here view Welles's speech as being of major significance, because the speech reiterates the solidarity of the American Republics, and because the speech recalls Roosevelt's guarantee that, should Canada be attacked by a non-American nation, the U.S. would assist Canada. Welles is to confer soon with other American Republics, especially South American countries, over U.S. military bases. The U.S. Government plans to build army, navy, and air bases around the Western Hemisphere as a defense against aggression. (Central News Agency, 29th)

### US Plans to Establish Naval and Air Bases in Brazil to Ensure the Security of the Panama Canal; Negotiations Also Underway with Venezuela and Other Countries

Washington sources recently stated that negotiations are underway between the United States and Brazil regarding US assistance in Brazilian defense. Progress is quite smooth, and the proposed plan involves establishing naval and air force bases within Brazilian territory for US use to secure the Panama Canal and Brazil. Additionally, the US intends to build military bases in Venezuela, the Galapagos Islands (belonging to Ecuador), and the Cocos Islands (belonging to Costa Rica), and is currently in negotiations with the relevant governments. (Havas, 28th)

### Soviet Ambassador to Britain Transferred to Bulgaria; Berlin Attaches Great Importance

A report from the Berlin correspondent of a Yugoslavian capital newspaper recently stated that Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, has been transferred to Bulgaria as minister. Berlin attaches great importance to this news. (Havas, 29th)

### US Cruiser Sails to Guam

Honolulu news today states that the US cruiser USS Pensacola sailed to Guam on Monday. There is no confirmed report as to whether other fleets have also been ordered to sail. (United Press, 29th)

### Travancore State's Indian Army Offered to Britain

Bombay announced today that the entire armed forces of the Indian state of Travancore have been offered to Great Britain for use in the war effort. (Reuters, 29th)

### Belgian Government Organizes New Army, Determined to Fight to the End; Continues to Exercise Authority Based on the Constitution; Parliament Scheduled to Convene in France Tomorrow

When the Belgian cabinet held a meeting this afternoon in Paris, all cabinet members were present. They finalized the content of Prime Minister Pierlot's speech (as reported in yesterday's telegram). Afterwards, Prime Minister Pierlot also spoke to the press, reiterating his determination to fight alongside Britain and France to resist aggression. Various parties and factions in France have sent letters and telegrams to the Belgian government, advocating for a joint fight to the end. Although members of the French Senate and Chamber of Deputies feel distressed, they believe that Belgian military and political personnel have been released from their oaths of allegiance to the King, and can now concentrate their efforts on continuing the war. (Havas, 28th)

Paris - Belgian Prime Minister Pierlot delivered a radio address today, declaring his determination to continue the war. Regarding the Constitution, he stated that according to the Belgian Constitution, if the King is unable to rule, the government can still be maintained. If the Senate and Chamber of Deputies are unable to convene, the cabinet can exercise the powers of Parliament under the Constitution. This provision is highly applicable to the current situation. In short, the current government is the only legitimate government of Belgium and has decided to continue the war, and will form a new army with the brave young men of the country who have been called into service and the Belgian troops currently in France to serve the country. The Belgian government, according to this declaration of the Prime Minister, has already ordered the reorganization of the Belgian troops in France and hundreds of thousands of Belgian youth into a strong force according to wartime arrangements. (Havas, 28th)

Paris - Following the radio address by Belgian Prime Minister Pierlot yesterday, declaring his determination to continue the war, the Belgian Parliament is scheduled to meet on the 31st of this month in a location in France to unanimously approve this decision. (Havas, 29th)

London - Belgian expatriates in London flocked to the Belgian embassy today to register for military service. According to Belgian Ambassador, Machianni, he intends to remain in office and be loyal to the Belgian government now in Paris. (Reuters, 29th)

Paris - The semi-official Belgian news agency, Agence Belge, recently issued a formal statement stating that the Belgian government has decided to continue fighting alongside the British and French forces with all the national strength, including the Belgian troops in France and the troops currently being organized, to overcome the aggressor. Belgian Minister of National Defense, General Denis, held talks with representatives of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies. Government authorities took measures last night to disregard the King's actions of violating the Constitution and ignoring the advice of cabinet members by ordering a ceasefire, in order to organize resistance. This action not only has the full agreement of Britain and France, but also fully corresponds to the sentiments expressed by the representatives of the entire people (referring to Parliament) when the German army invaded Belgium. In short, these measures include: (1) rapidly organizing troops and conscripting young men of military age to serve in the military; (2) protecting Belgian assets, such as bank deposits, securities, ships, and factories, that have been moved to France, to prevent them from falling into German hands. (Havas, 28th)

### King Leopold of Belgium's Surrender to Germany; King's Brother Wounded in Battle

London - According to reliable sources, King Leopold of Belgium informed General Weygand, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied forces, on Saturday, prior to his surrender to Germany, that the Belgian army would not be able to sustain itself without greater material assistance from the Allied forces. Most Belgian soldiers had been living on biscuits for three days, and their ammunition reserves were running out, with the current supply being the last batch. It is reported that the Belgian government in England made a last-minute attempt on Monday, sending two members of the Belgian royal family to the King's headquarters to ask him to leave Belgium for England, but the King refused, telling the two royals that despite the poor position of the Belgian army, he would remain with the army to the end. (United Press, 29th)

Paris - According to a report from the Belgian border published in the Paris Evening News, King Leopold of Belgium has arrived in Brussels and entered the residence designated for him at German headquarters. The report also carried news from the Italian border stating that the King's brother, Charles, has been seriously wounded and has a broken leg. The newspaper's Lisbon correspondent also stated that the King's three sons have arrived in Lisbon, but the Belgian embassy here claims no knowledge of these three reports. (United Press, 29th)

Paris - Well-informed sources here recently stated that when the Belgian army ceased fire at 4 AM yesterday, the armistice order was signed by an unknown Belgian general named Tanrousa, not Chief of Staff, General Jucier. According to the armistice order, Belgian troops were to line both sides of all roads, display large white flags, and allow German motorized units to pass through to attack Allied positions, and were prohibited from destroying military supplies and ammunition. (Havas, 29th)

Paris - Before delivering a radio address declaring his determination to continue the war, Belgian Prime Minister Pierlot, accompanied by Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Goflé, and Speaker of the Senate Guillon, went to the Place de la Concorde in this city and laid a wreath at the statue of the late King Albert I. The wreath was only adorned with a black silk ribbon and did not have any inscriptions. At the same time, many other wreaths were presented by other officials and civilians, some with various epigrams attached, such as "Today's exiles are tomorrow's soldiers," etc. At that time, crowds gathered near the statue, growing larger and larger, shouting "Long live Belgium." Later, a group of Belgian youths presented a wreath with an inscription that read, "Homeless subjects respectfully present this wreath to the eternally revered King, and weep before his spirit, saying, 'Your Majesty made our country glorious and great, but unfortunately, our unfortunate homeland has been greatly disgraced by Your Majesty's unworthy successor. We beseech Your Majesty to protect us and give us the strength to avenge this shame. We vow to avenge this great hatred.'" Many in the crowd wept upon hearing this dedication. (Havas, 28th)

### British Press Unanimously Condemns King's Treachery

London - Although all newspapers condemned the King of Belgium's surrender to the enemy and acknowledged the severity of the blow suffered by the Allies, they unanimously reiterated their belief in ultimate victory. The Times stated, "While we are willing to offer all possible forgiveness for the King of Belgium's sincerity in wanting to avoid bloodshed, we cannot help but express sympathy for the French Prime Minister Reynaud's stern attitude. This is certainly not a time for criticism." The Daily Telegraph stated, "French Prime Minister Reynaud's remarks that King Leopold's actions are unprecedented in history, and his tracing of the King's statement in 1940 that Belgium would resist as it did in 1914, were quite mild and not harsh. Belgium has now expressed its determination to fulfill its King's promises, but this King of 1940 is not the King of 1914." The Daily Mail expressed admiration for the Belgian army's heroic resistance, and said that the newly formed Belgian army may still be fulfilling its responsibilities as usual. The Daily Express stated, "We must focus all our anger on the one enemy, Hitler, and concentrate all our efforts to complete the only task of defeating him." The Daily Herald stated, "A certain evening paper called the King of Belgium 'King Quisling' (Quisling was the puppet of Norway) or a 'weak-willed King.' Whether the King is ultimately so is not worth our attention today. In short, we are not clear about the details, but no matter what the truth is, we cannot reduce the inescapable obligations we bear." The News Chronicle also stated that in the eyes of the British people, the King of Belgium's surrender to the enemy must be regarded as an incomprehensible act of betrayal. (Reuters, 29th)

### The United States Expresses Regret

Washington - Last night, White House spokesman Early told reporters that President Roosevelt was deeply saddened to learn of the King of Belgium's surrender to Germany. Belgian Ambassador to the United States, Robert De Vane, has notified the US State Department that the Belgian army did indeed surrender last night, and that he personally remains obedient to the Belgian government in Paris, which is determined to continue the war. (United Press, 29th)

### The Vatican is Heartbroken

Rome - The King of Belgium's surrender to the enemy has caused a profound impression in the Vatican, and they are particularly resentful that the heroic Belgian army has been ordered to abandon resistance, because the Vatican has for a hundred days prided itself on the fact that the Catholic Church is also participating in the struggle against those who hate religion and freedom. (Reuters)

### Poland Expresses Shared Grief

Paris - The Polish Cabinet recently unanimously passed a resolution stating that the Polish government expressed its respect for the attitude of King Haakon of Norway and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands during the most difficult battles in Norway and the Netherlands. Today, it shares the grief felt by the Belgian people because of the betrayal of their monarch. The will and perseverance of Britain and France will not be broken under any difficult test. The Polish military and civilians will remain firmly on the side of the Allies. (Reuters, 29th)

### Unique Views of the Japanese

Tokyo - The Asahi Shimbun stated that Belgium's surrender has dealt a major blow to the Allies in both economic and military terms, but it is unimaginable that the Allies would seek to make peace with Germany as a result. The Kokumin Shimbun said that the Allies suffered a fatal blow due to Belgium's surrender. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that the Allied military operation plan has been completely overturned, and the rumors that Britain and France disagree, or that France intends to negotiate a separate peace with Germany, cannot be dismissed as merely German propaganda. (Reuters, 29th)

### Germany Retaliates Against French Mistreatment of German Prisoners; Göring Announces Measures

Berlin - German Air Force Commander-in-Chief Göring, in view of the extremely cruel treatment of captured German airmen by France, issued an order yesterday stipulating retaliatory measures, declaring that henceforth, French airmen captured will immediately be handcuffed according to French methods, detained in special prisoner-of-war camps, and all current conveniences will be cancelled. In the future, if it is proven that captured German airmen have been assassinated, five French airmen prisoners will be immediately executed in compensation. If German airmen are shot at by French airmen after parachuting from damaged aircraft, 50 French prisoners will be executed. The Air Force Command stated that these retaliatory measures do not apply to British prisoners. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

Berlin - German Air Force Commander-in-Chief General Göring issued a decree yesterday changing the treatment of French air force prisoners, motivated by a report from German Air Force Captain Reichner, describing his temporary capture, the original text of which is as follows: "My aircraft was hit by an enemy fighter at an altitude of 4,000 meters near Lens and immediately burst into flames. I parachuted down. As I approached the ground, gunfire erupted from all sides, shooting at me. When I landed, several Moroccan native soldiers surrounded me, subdued me, tore my clothes, stole a watch, a ring, 50 marks, a notebook, and other items from my pockets, and repeatedly struck me with rifle butts, exhausting me. They then dragged me to the grass to execute me, but were stopped by a French military policeman, which saved me from death. After I bled, I was handcuffed. Although I protested the handcuffs to the two policemen, I was actually very grateful to them, because if they had not intervened, I would have been shot by the French army. I was taken into the forest and heard French soldiers say that more than one other captured German airman had died from abuse by Moroccan natives. That night, I was taken by car, along with two German officers, three air force personnel, and one cavalryman, to headquarters for interrogation. One officer died in the car from his injuries. We were then sent to a military hospital, where there was nothing to complain about except for a lot of garbage. Signed, German Air Force Captain Reichner." (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

### Italy Likely to Join the War After Belgium's Surrender; Negotiations on Control of the Mediterranean; British and Italian Unable to Reach Agreement

Rome - People here feel that King Leopold of Belgium's surrender may be a factor in determining Italy's attitude towards the war. Evening newspapers all state that King Leopold's surrender has serious consequences for the Allies. (Reuters, 29th)

Rome - Regarding the issue of Italy's participation in the war, foreign observers here state that it is almost certain that Italy will participate in the war after King Leopold III ordered a ceasefire. The only question at this time is where the country will deploy its troops for intervention. In short, Italy will take action as soon as the opportunity is ripe to seize certain benefits. This can be seen from the country's lightning invasion and occupation of Albania last year, taking advantage of the Czech crisis. It has not been a day since Italy prepared to deploy land and air forces at any time to invade Yugoslavia and Greece. Its goal is to occupy the Dalmatian coast of Southern European countries and the port of Thessaloniki in Greece, but due to other reasons, it has not been implemented so far. The reason for this is that Germany firmly requires Italy not to take any action in the Balkan Peninsula to avoid offending the Soviet Union. At the same time, Germany wants to obtain military supplies from Italy and naturally does not want the country to be involved in the war immediately. (Havas, 28th)

Rome - The Italian military magazine "Military Power" recently published an article arguing that the Red Sea should belong to Italy, just like the Mediterranean. The article stated, "The Red Sea does not originally belong to Egypt and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Hejaz, or Yemen, but it should belong to Italy, or it is more appropriate to belong to the Fascist Empire, because the Red Sea is an inland sea and is in Italy's interest, just like the Mediterranean. In other words, the Red Sea is only a transportation route for other countries, but for Italy, it is a lifeline. Italy does not want to continue to be confined to one corner of the Mediterranean and wants to advance to the ocean, so it cannot be satisfied with controlling the Suez Canal alone, but should also control the port of Aden." (Havas, 28th)

London - Undersecretary Butler told the House of Commons last night that Sir Greene had brought back from Rome proposals for a satisfactory basis for negotiation, the details of which are now being prepared. Greene attended a joint Anglo-Italian Standing Committee in Rome to discuss the control of contraband. (Reuters, 29th)

London - Well-informed sources here recently stated that Sir Greene, the British representative to the Anglo-Italian Permanent Economic Committee, held talks with Italian experts in Rome to discuss the issue of Britain and France implementing a blockade policy in the Mediterranean. A technical agreement has been reached, but no equal results have been obtained in the political field. Therefore, the two governments have not yet approved this technical agreement. (Havas, 28th)

### Red Army Movements Along the Black Sea Coast

The "Times" of Yugoslavia recently carried a Moscow dispatch stating that there have been Red Army movements along the Black Sea coast, and the garrison in the port of Odessa has also increased in recent days. According to Soviet political figures, the country does not want to participate in any war. These measures are only precautionary, not only to ensure the peace of Soviet territory, but also to maintain the status quo in the areas where Soviet interests lie. (Havas, 29th)

### Belgian Foreign Minister Cables Belgian Ambassador: Determined to Continue Resistance Against Germany; Belgian Cabinet Continues to Exercise Government Authority; Overseas Chinese in Shanghai Rise Up to Face National Crisis; US Flagship Returns to Shanghai Abruptly Yesterday

According to Havas News Agency sources in this city, Belgian Ambassador to China, Baron Guillaume, recently received a cable from Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak in Paris, stating that the Belgian cabinet, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, has decided to continue to exercise government authority and will fight to the end with Britain and France to defend the country's independence and territorial integrity. It is currently concentrating all its forces to form a new army. In addition to publishing this telegram, Ambassador Guillaume also appealed to Belgian expatriates in Shanghai to trust the fate of their motherland and face the national crisis together.

Belgian Expatriates in Shanghai Remain Calm

The Continental Daily News reports that Dutch expatriates in this city, after their motherland was annexed by Germany, announced that "everything will proceed as usual." Yesterday (the 28th), 120 Belgian expatriates in this city also faced the same situation. When news of the Belgian army's surrender to the German side reached Shanghai, the Belgian Consul General in Shanghai had not yet received official information. It is said that this is indeed terrible news, but the Belgian work management here will not have any changes.

Accept Instructions from the New Belgian Government

We will proceed as usual and accept orders from the new provisional Belgian government that may be established in a different location. The news of the Belgian army's surrender by order of King Leopold came suddenly, so the Belgian Consulate had no plans to convene a meeting of Belgian expatriates yesterday, and is currently waiting for official confirmation information from the Belgian government before taking action.

Belgian Businesses Unaffected

It is heard that this victory of the German side will not cause any changes to Belgian businesses in this city, because Sino-Belgian business relations have been suspended since the German invasion of Belgium. As for Belgian Far East shipping, it has never been large and was completely stopped in 1928, so there is no Belgian shipping problem. Most Belgian interests in Shanghai are in banking, steel, and chemical products industries, such as the Belgian Church with several large apartments, Sino-Belgian Bank, Italian Loan Bank, Ussi Metal Company, Mes Steel Company, and Maidian Chemical Products Company, etc.

Nationals of Six Countries Share the Same Fate

According to statistics, the countries of expatriates in Shanghai whose homelands were entirely or partially occupied by Germany include Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium. In addition, there are also Jewish refugees who fled from Germany and White Russian refugees who fled during the Russian communist revolution in 1918.

US Flagship Suddenly Sails Back

The US Navy Asian Fleet flagship USS Augusta and Admiral Hurd's private yacht, Ieshapeale, left Shanghai one after the other on the afternoon of the 28th, bound for northern China, as reported in previous reports. It is now known that the two ships suddenly returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon. The flagship entered the Wusongkou at 2:40 pm and sailed to the Yangjingbang Pootung area at around 5:00 pm, remaining moored to the British Navy pontoon. The yacht entered the Wusongkou at 4:20 pm and sailed to the Xinkaihe Pootung area at around 6:00 pm, still moored to the US Navy pontoon with the Guam and Luzon. The reason for the flagship and yacht's departure from Shanghai the day before and their trip to northern China is unknown due to military reasons.

British Soldier Attempts to Saw Off German Flagpole

Haitong News Agency Local News: It was announced here today that on the afternoon of the 26th of this month, a British soldier suddenly rushed into the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank at the intersection of Szechuan Road and Kiukiang Road, attempting to saw off the German flagpole on the roof of the bank and smashing several glass windows. The British soldier was then taken to the police station by police officers. Regarding this matter, the German Consul General in Shanghai yesterday submitted a protest letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, demanding a satisfactory resolution to the event that disturbed public order. It was later learned that the British soldier had been taken to the German side by the Shanghai Municipal Council to apologize, and the case may be resolved as a result.

Norwegian Celebrity to Broadcast Tonight

Mr. Pan Xun, a Norwegian well-known in wartime relief, is scheduled to broadcast an address tonight at 9:30 pm on the French broadcasting station, detailing how Germany prepares and trains wartime personnel. Mr. Pan also quoted the words of past German military and political figures to illustrate the strategies currently employed by the German army in Europe.

British Military Dependents Move Away from Western Shanghai

Several British military dependents residing in Xinyicun New Village on Yidingpan Road and Kainer Road in western Shanghai hired cars yesterday morning to move furniture and miscellaneous items. At that time, some people who did not know the truth spread rumors that the British army was withdrawing. In fact, according to the British military headquarters, there is no special significance to the British military dependents moving away from western Shanghai, but that the sanitation of "Datulu" is poor and has been found to be medically unsuitable for residence.

German Propaganda Prohibited from Sale

The North China Daily News reports that the German illustrated monthly magazine "Signal," sold in bookstores in the central district of this city, was banned yesterday (the 28th) by the Shanghai Municipal Police. The magazine is published in Berlin and sold by several bookstores on Szechuan Road for four yuan per copy. Its May issue is full of war photos and wartime propaganda texts. The reporter learned yesterday that all major bookstores in the central district had already stopped selling German propaganda publications.

British and French Strengthen Propaganda

Since the outbreak of the war in Europe, Mr. Code, the information officer of the German Consulate General in Shanghai, has been holding a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists once a week to report on the latest developments in the war. The German School at No. 1 Da Xi Road also shows films once a week. German businesses like 　Heng Company also publish a pictorial in 　and English, using 　paintings for propaganda. The German Far East News publishes an extra once a day. In addition, a fierce "radio wave war" has also been launched. The British and French have also strengthened their propaganda efforts in Shanghai.

### Daylight Saving Time: Decision to Implement, Date Soon to be Announced

Regarding Daylight Saving Time, the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Board of Directors decided to implement it during its routine meeting yesterday. The French Municipal Council (FMC) will adopt the same measure as soon as the SMC decides to implement it. It is hoped that all citizens will cooperate to witness its success. The above plan will be implemented in the shortest possible time. The Bureau will announce the date once it is decided.

According to the English-language "China Press" newspaper, the FMC approved the Daylight Saving Time plan at its meeting yesterday (the 28th). However, the final adoption of this plan will depend on the resolution of the SMC at its meeting this afternoon (the 29th).

### Shanghai Municipal Council: Increase Staff Subsidies, Universal Issuance of 65 Percent, Total Annual Cost of 4.45 Million

The SMC, in light of the recent soaring prices, which greatly affects the lives of the Council staff, should consider increasing the cost of living subsidies to show compassion. The case has been discussed at several meetings by the Council's Appraisal Committee. The Annual Meeting of Taxpayers of the current year, when passing the SMC tax increase, stated that the Council staff cost of living subsidies, there is a need to increase discretion, while hoping that this matter should be studied comprehensively by the Economic Committee.

Increasing Subsidies is Extremely Difficult to Delay

However, with recent continued price increases, the matter of increasing subsidies cannot be delayed. Furthermore, the Council's staff salaries currently lag behind those of major commercial organizations. As a result, many employees have resigned to take other jobs, or are preparing to resign, which significantly affects administrative efficiency. The rise in rice prices has the greatest impact on general low-level Chinese employees. As for employees holding contracts, they are suffering due to the low exchange rate and the high cost of imported goods.

Yesterday's Resolution on Additional Payments

At yesterday's routine meeting of the Council's Board of Directors, after repeated discussions, it was resolved that, regardless of whether Chinese and foreign staff held contracts or not, those whose names are on the salary list will receive a cost-of-living subsidy of 65 percent of their base salary, starting in May (previously 30 and 40 percent, with a minimum of 16 yuan). However, staff holding contracts will receive an additional "cost of living" subsidy of 12 percent. In other words, those who previously received a cost-of-living subsidy of 30 percent will now receive 65 percent from May onwards, and those who previously received a cost-of-living subsidy of 40 percent will now receive 77 percent.

A-Level Staff Exchange Subsidy

As for "A" level staff, they will receive a cost-of-living subsidy of 77 percent on two-thirds of their base salary and an exchange subsidy on one-third of their base salary. However, the exchange rate for the exchange subsidy will be reduced from 6 to 4.5. In addition, Chinese staff with salaries below 100 yuan will continue to receive rice subsidies. This increase in cost-of-living subsidies is estimated to cost around 4.45 million yuan for the whole year, or 2.97 million yuan for eight months. However, in order to ensure that staff can work with peace of mind and maintain good administrative efficiency, the Bureau has no choice but to take this measure.

### 50 Million Aluminum Coins Minted: Approval for Use

The Shanghai Banking Association, with the special permission of the Ministry of Finance, will issue 1-fen and 5-fen aluminum auxiliary coins, the first batch totaling 90 million coins, half 1-fen and half 5-fen. These have been shipped to Shanghai by the American firm Arctic Company and are gradually being issued by the Association for circulation in the market. Various industries have requested to use them for circulation and have been approved by the Banking Association. All major companies and businesses in need of aluminum coins can apply to the United Banking Reserve Association. After review and approval, they will be issued. However, due to the limited number of aluminum coins, requests from various industries will inevitably be subject to restrictions. It is also heard that because aluminum coins are currently in high demand on the market and are convenient to carry, the Ministry has approved continued minting and issuance for circulation.

### Ningbo Rice Shortage Reaches Crisis Point

The Ningbo Association in Shanghai received a telegram from Ningbo yesterday stating that all rice and grain in the villages had run out, and even bran and chaff were exhausted. Villagers were filling their stomachs with grass roots, and there were frequent incidents of rice抢夺, resulting in multiple tragedies. The situation was critical, and they requested immediate relief. After receiving the telegram, the Association convened an emergency meeting of the Relief Committee, deciding to urgently dispatch personnel to various industries and wealthy gentry to solicit funds for rice, and transport rice for relief, in order to alleviate the suffering. Upon hearing the news, the people of Ningbo responded enthusiastically.

### Today is the 15th Anniversary of the May 30th Incident: Citywide Silent Remembrance, Concession Authorities Implement Temporary Security, City Party Department Published Letter to Citizens Yesterday

Today is the 15th anniversary of the May 30th Incident. All sectors will silently mourn. The Concession authorities will implement security measures. Japanese troops in Hongkou will also step up defenses. The City Party Department issued a letter to the citizens, encouraging all sectors to complete the great mission of resisting Japan and building the nation. The details of the situation are as follows:

Commemoration by All Sectors, Security by the Authorities

Today is the 15th anniversary of the May 30th Incident. Due to the special circumstances, all sectors of the city will not hold commemorative ceremonies. The May 30th Cemetery in Zhabei will also suspend public sacrifices due to traffic congestion. However, at this extraordinary time, the citizens of all sectors deeply cherish the memory of the martyred pioneers, and deeply mourn their loss. Therefore, they unanimously and voluntarily stopped entertainment and banquets, and silently expressed their sorrow. They are also willing to carry forward the spirit of sacrifice of the martyred pioneers, support the policy of resisting Japan and building the nation, and strive for the final victory. In order to maintain peace and security within the concessions, the two Concession authorities have decided to implement temporary security measures and have instructed their subordinates to step up patrols and searches to prevent accidents. As for the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, it does not intend to deploy defenses, and traffic on the roads will not be closed unless necessary. In addition, the Japanese Naval Landing Force and the Japanese Military Police in Hongkou have also been on high alert since yesterday.

City Party Department Issues Letter to Citizens

The Shanghai Special City Party Department issued a letter to the citizens yesterday for the 15th anniversary of the May 30th Incident, saying: "Today is the 15th anniversary of the May 30th Incident. On this day, every patriotic citizen on the isolated island will remember the bloody tragedy on Nanjing Road 15 years ago. At that time, the blood of patriotic youth was spilled all over Nanjing Road, and it still seems to be flowing like a tide. We will never forget that it was Japanese imperialism that caused this massacre. At that time, Japanese yarn factories shot and killed worker Gu Zhenghong and injured many workers. These dead and injured were all our compatriots. Our passionate youth launched a furious anti-imperialist demonstration because of the Japanese capitalists' brutal killing of Chinese workers, and the rapid development of this anti-imperialist demonstration led to the bloody tragedy of the massacre on Nanjing Road. Now, Japan is even妄想着 to swallow China in one bite, but our three years of resistance have shattered the dreams of the Japanese warlords. They feel deeply mired in the quagmire, so they collude with scum and stage puppet wars. Our loyal and brave soldiers and civilians across the country are responding to this bloody reality with a united and merciless attack. We will never let the devil's hand strangle our throats. We must destroy the evil forces regardless of any sacrifice. The recent great victories in Henan and Hubei have approached the final stage of expelling the Japanese puppets. However, before their collapse, the Japanese puppets will definitely have a final struggle. We patriotic citizens on the isolated island must unanimously and firmly adhere to the belief in the Three Principles of the People, and under the correct leadership of the great leader President Chiang, unanimously attack all political conspirators who undermine the anti-Japanese and nation-building front of the Three Principles of the People, and the speculative merchants who disrupt the wartime financial institutions, and must eliminate them from the root in order to complete our great task of 'resisting Japan and building the nation.'"

Honesty and Shame Movement Encourages Unity

Today is the "May 30th" anniversary. The Honesty and Shame Movement Committee of all sectors of the city has produced and distributed key points of propaganda, and notified the district branches and committees of all sectors to inform their subordinate groups to carry out propaganda. There are four key points, the general idea is that the current situation is completely different from 15 years ago. The expansion of the European War has made Britain and France have no time to look east. The War of Resistance has entered the stage of victory. The Japanese will use the opportunity to make a desperate gamble with the fate of the whole country. Therefore, we must defend our motherland and save ourselves. Only with national unity, stepped up unity, and under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, can we bravely shoulder the sacred mission of national liberation to commemorate the great historical event of "May 30th."

### French Concession Various Taxes: Tax Rates Continue to Increase, Public Concession Hotel Industry Proposes to Increase Room Rates, Cooked Water Industry Seeks Reduction in Water Fees Still Unresolved

In order to balance its budget, the French Municipal Council has decided to increase land tax, house tax, and vehicle tax, etc., from July 1 to increase revenue. It is learned that the French Consulate General has drafted an order, which will be announced and implemented soon, to levy a business tax on the chemical match manufacturing industry. In addition, the Municipal Council's ambulances have also increased prices. Calculated on a half-hour basis, if the car is used for half an hour or less, it will be five yuan for residents of the French Concession and seven yuan for residents outside the French Concession. If the car is used for more than half an hour but less than 15 minutes, the residents of the French Concession should increase the fee by two yuan and five jiao, and the residents outside the French Concession should increase the fee by three yuan and five jiao. In addition, stores within the concession that are equipped with "slot machines" are also increasing taxes. The first machine in each store will be taxed at 300 yuan, the second machine will increase the tax by 50 percent to 450 yuan, and the third machine and so on will increase the tax by 100 percent to 600 yuan, all of which must be taxed every six months. In addition, the monthly license tax for塌 cars and老虎 cars that are equipped with rubber tires can be exempted from the tax increase. If they are not equipped with rubber tires, the monthly tax for塌 cars will increase to six yuan, and the monthly tax for老虎 cars will increase to two yuan.

Hotel Industry Proposal

Since the SMC increased the Chinese-style public tax surcharge by 150 percent on April 1 this year, the increased expenditures of various hotels led them to once request the industry association to decide to increase room rates in order to balance monthly expenditures. Later, the industry association strongly persuaded them to take care of the overall situation and endure the pain for a while, in order to avoid criticism from the public. According to a reporter from New Voice News Agency, the Chinese-style public hotels, with increasing daily expenditures, will be unable to maintain themselves and have successively sent letters to the Shanghai Hotel Industry Association, requesting permission to increase room rates appropriately. The industry association has scheduled a committee meeting within days to negotiate a proper solution. It is heard that starting next month, both Western-style and Chinese-style hotels will slightly increase room rates. According to the industry's business, it is still relatively prosperous, and daily income is also quite considerable. Therefore, it is hoped that the members of the industry association will carefully discuss and not increase room rates again.

Water Fee Problem

The Shanghai Cooked Water Industry Association yesterday sent representatives to negotiate with the Shanghai Waterworks Company, requesting preferential supply of tap water in order to continue business. The company's manager personally received them. After the representatives stated their intentions, the company's manager instructed them to negotiate with the SMC. If the authorities are particularly preferential, the company will comply. It is learned that the company has signed a contract with the SMC stipulating that the selling price of rice water cannot be涨跌随時, so this price increase has also been approved by the Bureau's Public Utilities Committee. The cooked water industry has scheduled a visit to the authorities today to appeal for preferential supply.

### Xujiahui Cathedral Holds Ordination of Priests, To be Held at 7:00 AM Today

Today (the 30th) at 7:00 AM, the Xujiahui Cathedral will hold an ordination ceremony. The Bishop of Shanghai, Haoyisai, will not be able to attend and has requested that Dai Miai, the Bishop of the Hangzhou District, represent him in all matters. A total of 25 people will be ordained as priests this time, including three from the Holy Name Society, seven from the Society of Jesus, three French priests, two American priests, four Chinese from the Holy Name Society, two from the Society of Jesus, and 15 priests from the Shanghai District. In addition, there is one Chinese priest from the Wuhu Church, two Spanish priests, two Chinese priests from the Xianxian (Hebei) Church, two Canadian priests from the Suzhou Church, one Chinese priest from the Anqing Church, one Italian priest from the Bengbu Church, and one Portuguese priest from the Macau Church.

### National Government Purchases Huge Amounts of Foreign Exchange to Replenish the Stabilization Fund, Stock Market Undercurrent Firm

According to foreign sources, the credit of Chinese legal tender is extremely strong. The Chinese government has purchased huge amounts of foreign exchange in the past few weeks to replenish the stabilization fund. The current stabilization fund is very solid, so the black market exchange rate has recently become more stable. Recently, Japanese banks in this port have also purchased legal tender with foreign exchange to purchase agricultural products in the occupied areas. As for the stock market, it has been quite encouraging recently. The news of the Allied forces' surrender of Germany did not have a major impact, because the brokers in the New York stock market suffered huge losses in the previous turmoil, and there will not be a serious backlash in the future. The recent statement by the authorities of the Dutch East Indies on joining the British and French monetary system agreements and adjusting export trade to countries outside the sterling bloc may have a good impact on local rubber stocks. It is said that the dividend distribution of the rubber planting company in this port will be restored soon.

### Coal Briquette Price Falls, 7 Yuan and 2 Jiao Per担

The coal market at No. 405 Tianjin Road used to quote prices in US dollars, causing large fluctuations in the price of various coal items. Unexpectedly, these unscrupulous merchants were unpredictable and mutually exclusive, resulting in a failure to unite. They have now disintegrated and gone their separate ways, so the price of coal has fallen without being struck. Although the US exchange rate has fluctuated slightly recently, general merchants obviously have no intention of sucking up and have sold existing goods on the market at reduced prices. Buyers have instead become more cautious and have no intention of continuing to purchase. Existing goods are flooding the market, and trading is sparse. Yesterday, in addition to the fixed prices at each freight station, the price of coal briquettes suddenly fell by 16 yuan per ton. (1) Wholesale price of factory coal: 132 yuan (previously 148 yuan), (2) Retail price: 7 yuan and 2 jiao per担 (100市斤). It is reported that the price of coal briquettes will continue to fall.

### Japanese Shipping Company Denies Withdrawal from European Routes, But Has No Confidence in the Future

The Shanghai branch of Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) firmly denied yesterday the report published by Haitong News Agency that, because the North Sea has become a war zone, all Japanese ships have received orders from the government to withdraw from European routes and change to routes to Japan, Australia, the United States, India, and Hainan Island. According to an employee of NYK's Shanghai branch, after hearing this news, the Shanghai branch immediately telegraphed the Tokyo headquarters to inquire about the truth. According to the reply, there have been absolutely no accidents on NYK ships sailing to Liverpool. Although the current situation in Europe will not affect the navigation of Japanese ships, what will happen in the future will depend on the development of the war.

### Yupi Public Bonds Tenth Principal and Interest Payments To Begin Tomorrow

The principal and accrued interest of the 12 million yuan Yupi Railway Public Bonds will be paid by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications from tomorrow. It is heard that the Shanghai branches of the three banks have received notices from their head offices, approving the handling of payments from that date.

### French Concession Will Enforce Price Controls Using Police Force, Warning Period for Merchants Has Ended, Price Control Committee Determined to Exert Effort for Implementation, Public Concession Has Not Yet Decided on Decisive Measures

Continental News reported that a member of the French Concession Food and Commodity Price Control Committee told reporters yesterday (28th) that if merchants in the French Concession do not immediately reduce food prices, they will be subject to legal action. Starting today (29th) for a few days, the French police will quietly inspect all food stalls and stores. All merchants who do not reduce prices to the level maintained before the recent contraction of the legal tender exchange rate will be punished one by one through

Administrative Means

or prosecuted in court. Since the French Municipal Council issued a final notice to those who raise prices on Monday, the warning period has indeed ended. The police will now implement measures to deal with unscrupulous merchants. At the same time, it is reported that the SMC will sue another batch of vendors who have not marked prices in court in early next week. On Monday, the SMC first sued 17 vendors who had not marked prices, four of whom failed to appear in court and will be summoned together for punishment. It is learned that the SMC had notified stores and markets within the concession that they must mark prices by last Saturday at the latest. According to SMC Deputy Secretary-General Gilbert, although the SMC police have also begun to pay attention to the prices of goods in markets and stalls, they

Have Not Yet Decided

to take the same decisive actions to deal with unscrupulous merchants as the French Municipal Council, because this matter is under consideration. In addition, according to the French Concession Price Control Committee, the two concessions are working together to use peaceful means to lower the prices of several commodities. For example, the price of ordinary bread in the two concessions is expected to be reduced to about 3 jiao 5 or 6 fen per pound soon. The authorities have consulted with bakery companies, asking them to reduce the selling price of household bread to the original level, while allowing the highest quality bread to be sold at any price. The bakery companies have nodded in agreement. This is one aspect of the work of the Price Control Committee. The committee knows the cost of goods, so it is not difficult to estimate what fair selling price merchants must maintain in order to make a profit.

Within the

Possible Range

the committee will exert its influence. If the influence is not enough to lower prices, the police force will be used to deal with it in the future. To date, the police have taken more action against unscrupulous merchants in the French Concession than in the Public Concession. Between May 4 and 26, the French police filed public lawsuits against 23 merchants for insufficient weight, with fines ranging from 20 to 250 yuan. In addition, 81 store owners were fined from 5 to 10 yuan each for not marking prices in the store windows. As for the Public Concession, only 17 merchants were summoned by the court for failing to mark prices. Except for four who did not appear in court, the rest were fined 8 yuan each.

### Sha Youren Obtains Hong Kong Second Mate Certificate

China's shipping industry has long been dominated by foreigners. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, in order to cultivate talent, revive the shipping industry, and regain shipping rights, the Ministry of Communications established the Wusong Merchant Marine Academy. Although the school has only been established for a few years, its academic excellence and outstanding achievements have been admired by people both at home and abroad. A few years ago, British Swire & Co., admiring the school's abundance of talent, negotiated with the school authorities to send graduates to the company for internships to deepen their knowledge. Sha Youren is a graduate of the fifth class of the Merchant Marine Academy, 24 years old, and a native of Jiangyin, Jiangsu. After graduating, he was sent to the company as an intern. He interned on Swire's foreign ships sailing to 小呂宋, Singapore, and other places. Later, he was sent by the company to intern on the Blue Funnel Line ships sailing around the world. The ship traveled around the earth for a week, passing through the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Atlantic Ocean, visiting New York, the Panama Canal, and the Cape of Good Hope in Africa. Sha's footprints have been welcomed by overseas Chinese everywhere. Sha has now completed four years of internship. A month ago, he enrolled in the Hong Kong Nautical School founded by the British for tutoring. On the 15th of this month, he participated in the British seafarer examination held in Hong Kong and obtained the British second mate certificate. Sha is the first Chinese to obtain the certificate in Hong Kong. It is heard that he will soon be appointed as the second mate of Swire's foreign ships.

### Gambling Dens in Western Shanghai to Close by the End of the Month, Hollywood on Yuyuan Road Closed Yesterday, Rumors of Establishment of "Garrison Headquarters"

After the Japanese "Gambling Supervision Department" ordered the closure of some small gambling dens in the Western Shanghai Road Expansion Area, the remaining larger ones continued to operate, and some even hired workers to renovate their facades and expand their businesses extensively, showing no sign of stopping. However, according to sources close to the matter, all existing gambling dens in the area, regardless of their background, will be ordered to close by 12:00 noon tomorrow (21st). However, according to another source, after the closure of each den, they will continue to reopen after a short period of time, because the employees of each gambling den, numbering more than 10,000, will find it difficult to maintain their lives afterwards, so the number will be gradually reduced in the future. We will record this for future verification. It is also learned that the Hollywood gambling den on Yuyuan Road was suddenly closed by the Japanese yesterday afternoon. It is learned that after the gambling den closes, the interior decoration will be completely removed and rebuilt. It is rumored that the so-called "Songhu Garrison Headquarters" will be established by the "New Government", but another rumor is that a "Special Police Bureau" will be established at the original site of the gambling den soon. (China News Agency)

### After Gu Lifeng Was Shot and Killed, Subordinates Suspected and Detained

Gu Lifeng, the "commander" of the puppet "Peace and National Salvation Army", was assassinated at 9:30 a.m. the day before yesterday in Room 801 of the Yangtze Hotel. At the same time, his concubine, Ms. Wu, his adjutant, Huang Shuangcai, and Hu A'quan were injured. The assassins all escaped. The details have been recorded in this newspaper.

Because Shao and others were suspected and needed further investigation, a request was made for permission to temporarily detain them for a week. After interrogation by Judge Qian Tingwei, Shao and others were ordered to be detained for a week for further interrogation.

### Shanghai Epidemic Hospital Broadcasts to Raise Funds, Yu Qiaqing and Others Initiate

The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Yu Qiaqing Road has been in operation for more than 20 years and is the only epidemic prevention institution founded by the Chinese in Shanghai. Diagnosis and medication are free of charge. In recent years, due to the crowded population in the concession, the work has become more arduous. Last year, the number of people treated reached more than 84,400. Recently, due to the soaring prices of medicines, expenses have been huge. At this time, it is difficult to raise funds. In view of this, local celebrities Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Jin Tingxun, Wu Limen, and others have initiated an invitation to famous opera singers to perform special programs of Peking opera at the Guohua Radio Station day and night on June 3rd and 4th to solicit donations from ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life. The entire Shanghai Peking opera community participated, and the program was extremely exciting. It is hoped that all sectors will enthusiastically order songs, help the needy, and donate generously, which is an unparalleled merit.

### Qiu Weiqing's Estate: Another Lawsuit Arises, Qiu Changhe Sues for Partition

Following the death of Dantu native Qiu Weiqing in 1925, who amassed a fortune in the dye business during the First World War, his close relatives have been in dispute for over a decade. They argue that the capital of the Dechangrun Dye Company, founded by Qiu during his lifetime, came from the sale of ancestral properties. Therefore, the profits earned over the decades should be

Shared by All Branches

And not be divided solely among Qiu Changsheng, Qiu's adopted son; Qiu Changyin, Qiu's biological son; and Qiu's nephew, Qiyuan. Consequently, lawsuits have been filed repeatedly, one after another, with little peace. However, each dispute has begun with litigation and ended with reconciliation, without any legal determination of victory or defeat. This has prevented a thorough resolution and made it difficult to permanently end the conflict. Now, the deceased's nephew, Qiu Changhe, has hired lawyer Cai Xiaobai to file a lawsuit, submitting a petition to the First Special Court, requesting confirmation of his one-fifth share of the Dechangrun equity. The petition details the

Qiu Family Genealogy

Tracing back five generations to his great-grandfather, leaving no stone unturned in tracing origins. It is a rare work in estate dispute cases. His grounds for the lawsuit are that seven mu of good farmland inherited from his great-grandfather, Peilin, in his ancestral home, were sold in the 20th year of the Guangxu Emperor (1894). The proceeds were taken to Shanghai by his uncle Beishan (Qiyuan's father) and Weiqing (Changsheng and Changyin's father) to establish the Dechangrun Dye Company, which has generated substantial profits over the years. His family has lived together in the same village for generations. Since the company's capital came from the jointly owned land proceeds, the

Generated Profits

Should also be shared by each branch. However, since the deaths of Weiqing and Beishan, the defendants have taken control of the company's assets, intending to monopolize them. He lost his parents early at the age of fifteen and was raised in his uncle's home. Now that he is growing older and his knowledge is increasing, he has begun to demand a division of the ancestral property. However, the defendants have not only refused but have also denied the truth, leaving him no choice but to file a lawsuit to seek relief. After being sued, Qiu's brothers also

Submitted a Defense

However, the original defendant's lawyers need to request access to the case files. Therefore, the case must wait until both sides' lawyers have reviewed the files of previous cases before the court schedules a hearing.

### Guo Youshou Inspects Education in Sichuan Province

(Chengdu News) Director Guo of the Sichuan Education Department inspected the state of education in various places in order to implement the new county system and promote national education. He went to Pi County on April 25, Wenjiang on May 12, Chongning on the 13th, and reached Mianyang along the Sichuan-Shaanxi Road on the 15th, returning to Chengdu on the evening of the 17th. According to his inspection of eight counties including Pi, Wen, Chong, Xin, Hanzhou, and Mianyang, most were able to pay attention to the implementation of national education. However, because the townships and Baojia had not been properly organized, there was no way to proceed. Furthermore, the number of school-age children, the number of enrolled children, the number of non-enrolled children, the number of out-of-school children, and the number of out-of-school adults have not been thoroughly investigated. Although there are many energetic and capable education administrators in various counties, there are also some who are dispirited or lack ability, making it impossible to promote the work. In general, the hard work and diligence of education personnel at all levels are not enough. As far as general education in each county is concerned, the counties near Chengdu are more advanced, especially the counties along the highways. The further north along the Sichuan-Shaanxi Road, the more backward it becomes. The disparity in quality cannot be measured by distance.

### Finance Speculation on the Future of the European War Differs, Foreign Exchange Market Trends Gradually Becoming Unclear

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The trend in the private market for British and American currencies shifted to easing again, likely due to news of Belgium's surrender to Germany. The increasingly precarious position of the Allied forces in the European war is undoubtedly having an impact, leading to a wave of selling. However, there's also speculation that peace could be achieved sooner, making the future development either bullish or bearish, remaining a mystery to operators. Today's half-day trading saw strong efforts from Chinese merchants and speculators to sell off. Occasionally, Japanese trading houses and banks also came to release holdings, causing the market to harden slightly. American banks and foreign firms showed strong interest, so supply and demand remained balanced, and the easing trend was slow. As a result, the spot price for British gold was 4 1/4 pence at 14.0625, and the US dollar was 5.5 yuan, both easing by 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively compared to the previous day. Futures also increased. No market in the afternoon for Wednesday.

Chinese Merchants Quite Eager to Sell

In the early morning, London large bars, both near and far, fell by 3.125. The New York silver price remained flat, and London raw gold remained stable. Exchange rates for British against US, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The US dollar appreciated by 1.625 against the British pound, depreciated slightly by 0.20 against Shanghai, and depreciated by 1.5 against the French franc. Central Bank's listed prices for various currencies remained unchanged. Banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning: British gold at 4 1/4 pence at 1.125, and US dollars at 5.4375 yuan, showing a trend of British easing and US tightening compared to yesterday's close, due to the further decline in exchange rates. After the opening, Chinese speculators were eager to sell, successively selling to foreign firms June British gold at 4 1/4 pence and June US dollars at 5.21875 yuan. Although the US dollar was stable at that time, there were already slight signs of hardening. HSBC's listed prices were announced without change. The silver equalization tax was announced to be reduced by 2%. Thereafter, Chinese speculators continued to sell off, selling June US dollars at 5.25 yuan to American banks. The market softened, but American banks' appetite for US dollars remained good, so the selling by Japanese trading houses etc. did not have much impact. May US dollar transactions were made at 5.5 yuan. Before the close, Japanese Bank (Yokohama Specie Bank) also sold some advantageous spot US dollars to foreign firms, at the same price of 5.5 yuan. As a result, British gold was at 4 1/4 pence at 14.0625, and US dollars were at 5.5 yuan. June British gold was at 3 1/4 pence at 98.4375, and June US dollars were at 5.25 yuan. Compared to the previous day's evening close, spot British hardened by 0.015625, and US dollars eased by 0.03125. June British and US currencies both increased by 0.03125. No market in the afternoon for Saturday.

Hong Kong US Dollar Slightly Eases

Hong Kong, 19th (Wednesday) Telegram: The exchange market opened steadily this morning. Spot and futures for the British pound remained unchanged. Spot US dollar depreciated by 0.125 to 19.75 yuan. Spot Shanghai currency appreciated by 1 yuan to 361 yuan. Spot Japanese currency hardened by 0.75 to 83.5 yen. Steady at 11:30 am, no changes in various currencies. No market in the afternoon for Wednesday.

Tianjin Exchange Rates All Tighten

Shanghai currency appreciated by 0.75 yuan to 114.5 yuan. "Joint Notes" in the black market depreciated by 0.75 yuan to 100.075 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Fall in Unison

After the news of the Belgian King ordering the cessation of hostilities with Germany was disclosed in various newspapers, the previously prosperous foreign currency market suffered another setback yesterday. British and American gold pounds, and Shanghai taels, all fell by two yuan. British and American gold notes were weakened by the easing of the black market exchange rate, which made supply ample, and market prices fell across the board. Hong Kong notes fell by three cents following the decline in Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rates. Annam, Canada, Philippines, and other currencies also had ample supply, and market prices uniformly weakened. Japanese gold notes had a balanced supply and demand in the early morning, but suddenly supply became abundant, and market prices fell. The evening market retreated to 1.17 yuan. Korean notes had slightly more supply, and market prices were slightly weaker, ending the evening at 0.96 yuan.

### Gold Market Swayed by the European War

Yesterday's private market for spot Shanghai taels reversed and fell, retreating to within the 6,000 yuan range. This was due to the Belgian army's surrender to Germany in the European situation, slightly affecting the Allied position, causing fear and nervousness, and being seen as unfavorable to the bullish side. The exchange market also turned from easing to hardening, making it difficult to stir up a buying mood in the market. It fell by 110 yuan right from the start, opening at 5,910 yuan. Subsequently, securities firms and money changers saw the price as cheap and tended to buy, rising to 5,965 yuan. However, as exchange rates reported gains, sellers gathered, and the lowest point tragically reached 9,891 yuan. Later, gold firms and securities firms engaged in further buying, and it was rumored that Hong Kong firms also took in some, causing it to rebound to 5,960 yuan before the midday close. The closing price was reported at 5,920 yuan, a slight decrease of 100 yuan from the previous day. Trading was still active, around 2,000 taels. Gold ornaments at silver shops were listed at a slight decrease of 10 yuan, while customs gold etc. remained flat.

Shanghai Taels Fall Back by 100 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels), initially due to reports of European news being seen as bearish, caused a scattered and listless mood. A certain securities firm took the lead in calling for sales, while those looking to enter were observing, and the few buyers who were present all took advantage of the situation to lower prices, thus sharply pushing down by 110 yuan. Fifty taels were sold by securities firms to gold firms at 5,910 yuan. Subsequently, a certain money changer took advantage of the low prices to search for purchases, and silver firms also joined in to push prices up, with silver firms and Dihao firms each buying ten taels from jewelry shops, all at 5,965 yuan. Thereafter, gold firms took advantage of the high prices to sell, and a certain money changer also switched from buying to selling, and as the exchange market also became stable with a hint of hardening, the market weakened again, retreating by 75 yuan. Thirty taels were sold by gold firms to securities firms at 5,890 yuan. Soon, a certain securities firm suddenly came to absorb them, returning to the 5,900 yuan range. Later, relying on money changers and gold firms buying from each other, it rebounded by several tens of yuan again. Money changers bought ten taels from silver firms at 9,960 yuan. Near the close, buyers gradually decreased, and the surplus became visible, thus falling again by 40 yuan. The No. firm sold ten taels to silver firms at 5,920 yuan as the midday closing price. As a result, it fell back by 100 yuan compared to the previous day, with a range of 75 yuan up and down in half a day. The selling price of spot gold at cash gold firms was a dozen or so yuan higher compared to Shanghai taels, while the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. Spot gold was more than 50 yuan lower than listed gold, with little activity.

Shanghai Taels Listed Down 10 Yuan

The selling price for gold jewelry per tael at jewelry stores, initially Datonghang still hung at 620 yuan. Until 10:05 am, it was listed down by 10 yuan, after which there were no changes. Datonghang changed to hanging at 610 yuan. The new peers are the same as the upper price, with purchases down around 30 yuan.

### Grains Tight Credit, Abundant Sales of Foreign Rice

The rice market carried on the afternoon rally from the previous day, with a fairly good mood. Clients from the inland Zhejiang province's Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Ningbo areas, and the Xiashi, Sujia, and Lu areas continued to trade actively, and local stores also embellished from within, so sellers' voices gradually rose. The prices of various goods once increased by 6-7 cents. For example, No. 1 Old Saigon opened at 52 yuan, No. 2 Old Grade at 49.7 yuan, Fire-Ground Point at 50.067 yuan, No. 2 Siam High Grade at 49.2 yuan, and Small Ground at 48.78 yuan. However, this time it was entirely for actual sales, and once the price was high, it would ease again. Therefore, the market was like a flash in the pan, and it quickly returned to softening. Furthermore, at this time, some cargo owners are devaluing to sell due to credit relations, so the closing market still belongs to mediocrity.

Foreign rice continues to be inquired about by Hangzhou, Shantou, and inland groups. Transactions with all Japanese customers still have more than 6,000 bags, and the source continues unabated. Although new transactions are rarely concluded, the road to orders and inquiries has not been closed. And at a time when credit is tight before the festival, snatching business has gradually calmed down, and floating hoards are sold off quite a bit. The spot rice in each grade has been gradually reduced in price, and the early market opening price of the most active small ground rice was 48.8 yuan, which fell to 48.34 yuan at the midday closing, and as small as 48.2 yuan in the evening market, which is 5 cents lower than the previous night.

Also, yesterday, another 1,256 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai, loaded from Hong Kong by the Taikoo Company's Yuezhou wheel. The wheel also has more than a thousand bags, which will be shipped to Yantai by the original ship today.

Due to the expensive prices in the producing areas, the source of thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice has turned weak, resulting in few arrivals. Only 7-800 bags arrived yesterday. It is rumored that outside the market, the intention of sellers of goods is very firm, especially for special goods, and those in need must endure the procurement. The price is increased by half a yuan. Changbang Zhentou Qinggeng is shouted at 55 yuan, opened at 54 yuan, ordinary Qinggeng at 53 yuan, powder glutinous at 51-2 yuan, Changkun geng special at 52-3 yuan, big city at 51.5 yuan, second-grade to old goods at 50 yuan to 49 yuan, Qingsi thin rice high from 53 yuan, second-grade to 50.05 yuan, Nangang early rice at 49 yuan, Hu Jian at 47.5-6 yuan.

Yesterday, only 5-6 cars of glutinous rice arrived, but there was a lot of crowding before, and the stock in the piles was quite abundant, and the seasonal demand was also managed smoothly, so the overall situation was similar to sales. The opening prices are not much different from before. If Jinli special Yuan is still around 44 yuan, Chang Dan goods are high from 43 yuan to 41 yuan, and Jiangbei Bai Yuan is 40 yuan.

### New Wheat Appears on the Market, Arrival in Shanghai May Still Have to Wait

The flour market is slightly different. The No. 2 flour factory's inventory is still 13.8 yuan, standing still. Except for the retail transactions on this street, there are no other whole ticket turnovers. Because the customer appetite has been quiet for a long time, and the intention is to remove the small ones, the customer market may have a small drop. However, the domestic miscellaneous brand powder is more popular because the current stock has been depleted, and it is welcomed by some local customers. The market price has repeatedly risen. It is heard that Shunfeng Brand has opened over 13.75 to 8 cents, and Shuangshi also needs more than 13.7 cents. The future market is still shouting high. The return of old car brands is the same price as the factory's inventory, but there is no formal market.

The transaction of old wheat has been announced. The new wheat has not yet been officially launched on the market. It has been seen in the Kunsu area of inland and the vicinity of Pudong. This year's products are quite good. However, according to inland customers, the price of wheat in the producing area is 323 yuan per stone, which is 170 jin per city scale in old bushels. Adding 5.2 yuan for freight and donations, the price in Shanghai is about 24 yuan per 100 jin, which is higher than old wheat. It is difficult to handle the transit. It is also heard that a certain party is paying close attention to wheat production, and there are rumors of control, so the source of new wheat may still have to wait.

### Miscellaneous Grains New Broad Beans on the Market, Wuhu Beans Arrive in More Than Forty Bags Bean Cake Sales are Booming and Prices are Also Rising

This geng day is sunny with little rain, and broad beans appear on the market quite early, but the transfer terminals in this city are in a special situation, and the new ones are seen quite late. It was passed to the city yesterday that more than 40 bags of new white-skinned small broad beans from Wuhu arrived, but because the samples have not been seen, no transactions have been made. Other Wenzhou white-skinned Minhang green skins are heard to be on the market within this week, but the cost of handling is difficult to grasp, so transit passengers dare not boldly purchase, and the arrival of goods may not be easy to link. Yesterday, soybeans still maintained a solid and stable situation, and the high beans in the market were slightly built two or three cents. The path of going continues to be inquired by oil mills and hoarders, and each bean is more than 50 bags. At present, the bean cake sales market is regardless of inland exports and insiders and outsiders have intentions, and a total of 26,000 pieces of each cake are opened, so the market price is booming. The city rose by another two cents compared to the previous day. According to the market practice, the market will be closed today for one day.

There are 545 bags of beans today and 350 bags of raw peanuts and 350 cans of peanut oil are shipped to Hong Kong, and there are another 372 pieces of raw oil from Tianjin.

### Yarn and Flowers Profit-Taking, Yarn Prices Fall

The yarn market, which had risen for two consecutive days, fell again yesterday. This is because Hong Kong has been full of appetite, and the procurement is not as prosperous as it used to be. At the same time, the situation of the European War is getting worse and worse, so the hearts of speculators have turned indifferent. At present, those with high debts are selling out, and those with low prices are still dragging in, so in this situation, it is still not out of the hovering situation. The June opening price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,410 yuan, doing as much as 1,350 yuan.

The current yarn market has fallen in the morning because those who make profits are fighting to settle the accounts. At the same time, the overseas Indian and American cotton markets have fallen in unison, and people are more relaxed. The price of 20-count double horse is 1,375 yuan, but the sellers are coming one after another, falling straight to 1,310 yuan, and then the short sellers are slightly filled, and then recovered. By the close, it was still falling. The semi-daily turnover statistics totaled 1,485 bales, the market for 20-count double horse fell 30 yuan. Today, 785 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong, and the amount of each gang purchased is divided as follows:

Same Industry 1,060 Hong Kong 385

Ningbo 30 Amoy 10

Statistics 1,485

### Cotton Factory Does Not Move

The transaction of this cotton is slightly active, but the amount of the transaction is special, and the factory is still waiting and watching without moving to do it. Only the same industry has a little mutual buying and selling. The situation of the transaction of the current cotton is listed on the left,

South Pacific 205.00 The same industry enters 305 bags

Pengjiapu 246.00 240.00 again 200 pieces

Fire straw bag 205.00 again 190 bags

Meterling 200.00 again 200 pieces

In addition, the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market first fell in the morning due to the unfavorable news of the European military operations, and the cotton market was greatly pressured by the sellers, and the cotton price fell by more than 40 pounds of sound, and then rose due to the purchase of the public and the resistance of some short sellers. As a result, the closing price was 7 pounds lower than the recent decline of the previous day and 178 pounds lower in the distant period. The Indian cotton market is predicted to fall by 9 Robi.

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been tight in each of the past few days due to the end of the month, and the bottom of each party is not counted, but because there are not many cotton yarn mattress orders, and although the intention to buy cotton is strong, there is no power to buy it, so the market transaction is extremely quiet. The price of the cotton market yesterday is calculated by converting the US dollar at 5.4375 yuan,

Twenty-count US Meterling 509.50

Twenty-count Again Subordinate 298.10

Thirty-two-count Again 318.50

Thirty-two-count Again Subordinate 218.10

Forty-two-count Again 23 Tian.95

Forty-two-count Again Subordinate 320.50

### Securities Domestic Debt Waiting to Move External Shares Jardine Matheson Rise Again

The black market for securities did not reduce its hovering and stagnant situation yesterday, and the highs and lows are still around one corner. The reason is still that the interest rate is too high, which makes people stop. The arbitrage for foreign exchange has been high in recent days, and the arbitrage for cotton yarn has been more than one corner, that is, ordinary gold US dollars and external shares mortgage loans also need to bear interest of three or four points. Public debt is used for exchange transactions, but it also needs more than one and a half points. For this reason, the various parties have a lot of concerns, and are unwilling to store in advance unless there is definite good news coming, so as not to consume interest. But whenever there are occasional people who sell goods for money, they are sold in the market, and those who take the opportunity to take them in are immediately with them. Although there were not many transactions yesterday, the market price was quite firm, especially for the E-kind. In the afternoon, Defu suddenly sold 890,000 E-kinds, but immediately aroused the appetite of all parties, and after continuous absorption, although it had fallen slightly by one or two corners, it still returned to the highest price of 50 yuan for the close, and it can be seen that there are many people waiting for the opportunity to move. As a result, the highs and lows are mutually visible, and the E-kind rose one corner to be the best, and the number of transactions totaled more than 300,000 yuan. The simple table is listed later,

The stock transaction traded 100 shares of the stock exchange in the stock exchange, and the price was 30 yuan and 5 corners.

When the public industry stock market opened, buyers did not dare to make a price, and the seller's needs were lower than the previous close, but soon the situation turned steeply, public confidence was restored, and the price gradually prospered. The turnover in half a day actually reached 250,000 shares. Jardine Matheson opened at 38 yuan, and then the price was never seen again, closing at 39.5 yuan, only deducting 2 yuan from the previous close. The trend of the British Union Stock Market was slightly agitated, opening at 28.5 yuan, seeing a low price of 26.25 yuan after opening, and then rising back to a high price of 31.25 yuan, closing at 20 yuan. According to the situation, although the stock has announced the payment of an interim interest of one yuan, the image to the public seems to be still very small.

The British Commercial British Union Shipyard Co., Ltd. is scheduled to distribute an interim dividend of one yuan per share in national currency on July 1 for the one-year period ending at the end of September 1940.

The Bo Heng and Qujiadi Lin Rubber Co., Ltd., managed by the British Commercial Xiangmao Foreign Company, is scheduled to distribute the second interim dividend of one-year ending at the end of June 1940 on June 4, with Bo Heng paying a national currency of three corners per share, (including the one-time paid four corners) and Qujiadi Lin paying a national currency of three yuan per share, (including the one-time paid four yuan and five corners), and the Ketabalu Rubber Co., Ltd. is also scheduled to distribute an interim dividend of one year ending at the end of June 1940 on June 12, with a national currency of three corners per share (including the interim paid four corners and five points).

The 20th annual shareholders' meeting of Xuenawang Oak Property Co., Ltd., managed by the British Commercial Huitong Foreign Company, is scheduled to be held in Shanghai at 11:30 on June 11, and at the same time, the interim dividend for the one-year period ending at the end of January 1940 will be paid, with eight cents of national currency per share, including the interim dividend paid three cents of national currency, a total of one corner and one point of national currency for the whole year.

The 20th annual shareholders' meeting of Diban Oak Co., Ltd., managed by the Huitong Foreign Company, is scheduled to be held in Shanghai at 11:45 on June 11, and at the same time, the last dividend for the one-year period ending at the end of January 1940 will be paid, with one corner and two points of national currency per share, including the interim dividend paid, three corners of national currency per share, a total of one corner and five points of national currency for the two whole years.

London, 28th (Tuesday) Telegram, the listed market for the stocks of the British Commercial Far East Companies today, HSBC Bank shares rose one pound each, with the British registered shares being 84 pounds and the Hong Kong registered shares being 83 pounds, and the rest unchanged.

London, 28th (Tuesday) Telegram, the listed market for Chinese external debt today, is again flat, with no changes in the upper and lower grades of debt.

### Medicinal Materials Red Beans Miss Each Other More Yan National Decision Difficult to Affordable

The red beans are produced in the South China, and have also been shipped to Shanghai recently. The samples have been seen, and the color is red and lovely, and there are very few black seeds. The asking price of the square is 130 yuan, and no transaction has been made yet.

National decision clear (that is, abalone shell) is limited in quantity and has been silent for a long time. Nine pieces were shipped by the Yusheng wheel the day before yesterday, and are being tested in the report. Once they are stacked, they will be sold. It is heard that the cost is special, and its price is difficult to hope low.

### Coal Hongji White Coal Newly Arrived

Hongji white coal, in recent times, because the supply and demand are equal, the market is still stable, and yesterday, the Mailer wheel had another 1,160 new goods shipped from French property, and has also arrived at the dock for unloading, and is sold by the agent of Yitaixing and Nanyang managers. The original price of the original disc does not move, the Hongji screened blocks of each ton are 230 yuan, and the delivery power is included.

### Sugar Market The Price of National Sugar Production is Already High

Yesterday, the market was slightly looser due to the weakening of the market. The association's plate, the spot 24 thick white foreign cargo, was initially 77.5 yuan, and then slightly tightened to 78.7 to 8 cents, deducting 7 cents. The cargo shipped on June 3 for transshipment was 55 yuan to 54.5 yuan, and the spot was 54.2 to 54.5 yuan, and then 54 yuan, all small halves of yuan. The Taikoo vehicle white B 79.3 yuan, small two corners, Dutch red 58 yuan, national sugar is still lacking in opening, only Quanzhou message such as the top white that is, with the city and burden to make Shen, also needs more than 100 yuan, and Anhai message top white draw Shen 110 more yuan, upper red 80 more yuan, are extremely high, and it is difficult to draw in harmony.

### North and South Loans Bamboo Shoots and Fragrant Mushrooms The Market is Stable

Du bamboo shoots were originally expected to be loose, but only a few pieces have arrived recently, so they have to maintain the original price, and are still called stable. The market disc is still called 160 yuan.

The arrival and sale of fragrant mushrooms is not weak, but now that the mildew season is approaching, they must be dried and baked, so that the body is dry and easy to store. The current HuaBu mushroom and Niu Zhuang sale is 508.8 to 505.6 yuan, 497.9 yuan, large slices of 570 yuan, army mushroom 565.6 yuan, the cargo body is ordinary, and if the Tunxi mushroom and Ping Zhuang still need 56-70 yuan, thick mushrooms 66-70 yuan, the flower mushroom is outside the 900 yuan range, and its potential is stable.

### New Toona Sinensis Small Ten Yuan

There are not many new Toona sinensis arrivals recently, but the going is also weak, so even though it is a seasonal product, the market price is still downstream. The current market disk is sold at 70 yuan, which is ten yuan lower than before, and the opening price is even more depressed. It is found that there are only two firms in this geng, and the selling price is not competitive, and the twist is stable.

### Seafood Domestic Shrimp Rice Continues to Be Sold

Yantai shrimp tail, recently, there have been shipments, and then sold. The Longsong Island tail is 328 yuan, which is 8 yuan better than the previous market, and the Weiwei is 383 yuan. In addition, Jiangbei opened a batch of 175 yuan.

The arrival and sale of American canned abalone is balanced, and the market stock is not lacking. The current is 210 yuan, and the potential is stable.

### Hardware The Opening Price of Purple Copper Ingots Is Seen to Rise

The transaction of purple copper ingots has been smooth, and the copper skin forging and other gangs have adopted the purchase rate. It is found that the number of transactions in the market is about 200 dan. The industry's thinking has been restored, and the opening price has frequently seen an increase. The market shouting price is like the old TC, each burden of 350 yuan, and the T-shaped brand is sold for 370 yuan each. It is found that the source of the cargo is currently only one place in the United States, but the transportation in the middle is difficult, resulting in fewer and fewer arrivals, so the market is in good heart, and the upcoming market is afraid that it will rise again. In addition, such as purple copper sheet each burden of 580 yuan, brass sheet each Tan sale 470 yuan, (these are all Shanghai produced goods), 16th brass wire each burden of 365 yuan, are higher than before without falling, other such as three-four-point bamboo steel bars each ton sale 1,500 yuan, five-point to coarse pattern each ton sale 1,450 yuan, black iron blank each bundle shouting 1,200 yuan, Qing lead tinplate each volume sale 200 yuan, Qing lead narrow strip each box sale 130 yuan, corrugated iron six feet each sheet sale 7.6 yuan, seven feet each sheet sale 8.6 yuan.

### Old Newspaper Snippets - Sixty-Seven Years Ago (299)

From the Local News Section of the Twelfth Year of the Tongzhi Reign (Qing Dynasty)

Beggar Chewing Porcelain Shards

At the end of last month, a beggar was soliciting alms from customers in a teahouse outside Xumen. He pleaded with everyone, but received not a single coin. Suddenly, a customer, annoyed by his persistent rambling, gestured as if to throw his teacup at the beggar. The beggar quickly grabbed the cup, put it in his mouth, and began chewing vigorously. The porcelain shards felt as refreshing as drinking ice and as easy to chew as wax. He swallowed them with a gulp, making loud noises. After finishing, he lay on the ground, clutching his stomach and crying out. Upon seeing this, the customers threw coins for him, urging him to leave. The beggar picked up each coin, amassing over a hundred coppers, before joyfully singing and dancing his way out.

Actor Highly Praised

Wu Lanxian, a female performer, was not particularly talented in either appearance or skills, yet she was praised by the people of Suzhou. In a performance of the play "The Fox Spirit" at the Puan Bridge Theater in the latter part of last month, Lanxian exaggerated the fox-like seductive behavior, which was not at all elegant. Unexpectedly, the theater apparently had a resident fox spirit. That day, when Lanxian left the stage, she suddenly fell ill, her condition becoming critical! Later, the troupe leader learned of this and pleaded repeatedly, and she miraculously recovered.

Earthquake in Shanghai

At the third quarter of Yin time (around 4:45 AM) on the 13th, when most residents were sound asleep, an earthquake suddenly struck Shanghai, lasting for about four or five seconds. Utensils in the rooms clattered and collided. Birds in cages flapped their wings restlessly. The tremor seemed to originate from the north and move southward.

### From Fear to Courage (4)

He believed that religion was not a refuge for the weak but a weapon for the strong. In his writings, he said, "I see religion as a way of advancing in life, by which man is always the master of his environment, not a willing sacrifice to it." When I was in college, the focus of life research was analyzing oneself—"Know thyself." Today, psychology proves that the main topic of religion is "self-cultivation and moral practice." Just like a pianist becomes familiar with the intricacies of music through practice, a person must constantly practice the art of living in order to be the master of their environment. To overcome your fears, you must do this, and the first thing to pay attention to is acting purposefully at every step. Have you ever learned to dive from a high diving board? If so, you know the way to overcome fear. You start steady, then lean forward, and then hesitate and fearfully retreat. You try again, and it's the same. Every hesitation creates fear. Finally, you get angry at your own uselessness and plunge down regardless of everything, your arms and legs not at the proper angles. After landing, you feel angry and embarrassed. But if you continue to practice, you will eventually be steady and comfortable, and feel happy when you get ashore. You then become an experienced diver. Overcoming fear is no different. You must plunge into the river of life, repeatedly overcoming all fears. As the American celebrity Emerson said, "Do what you are afraid to do, and fear disappears." If a person can remember their own experiences every day, see life as a treasure, sincerely seek one victory at a time, and overcome one fear at a time, they can gain a rich life. The prophet said, "Believe in God and the way God works, believe in the way God accomplishes things. First, understand that the life you must deal with is the material for building your character. The second step is to cultivate your own creative courage. In other words, do what should be done, practice on the battlefield of life, and overcome your fears." Jesus did this, often telling people, "Go and do." Once you fight on the battlefield of life, you can overcome fear and build your character. Therefore, religion can solve this problem of overcoming fear for us. The first step is to have faith, and cultivate self-confidence from that faith. The second step is to put what you believe into practice in your daily life. (End) For detailed research, please write to P.O. Box 1227.

Historical Talk

### The Potential of National Consciousness

— Li Shaozhong

It may be true that in the past, the Chinese lacked a modern sense of national consciousness and statehood. However, among the broad masses of Chinese people, there existed an invisible "latent national consciousness" that was both widespread and deeply rooted, which has gone largely unnoticed. Perhaps this is one of the fundamental reasons why the Chinese nation has been able to stand firm despite frequent foreign aggression.

In the past, if you grabbed a peasant in a remote village or a coolie in a city and asked him what "nation" was or what "country" meant, he would likely stare blankly and not know how to answer. But if you asked him who Guan Gong was, or who Yue Fei or Xue Rengui were, most would be able to tell you a lot of stories. These stories are a rich and great history of thousands of years that has cultivated a "latent national consciousness."

These stories, while not necessarily entirely accurate, instilled in the largely uneducated non-intellectuals a sense of history. Here, we must not overlook the fact that, even now, non-intellectuals make up a huge percentage of our nation.

These historical stories not only made the general public aware of the difference between "foreigners" and "China" by knowing that "Yue Fei defeated the Jin people," but also instilled in the masses a sense of righteousness of "honoring loyalty and hating treachery" through the story of "Qin Hui killing Yue Fei." Therefore, when you see someone doing something "excretory" to that "precious" iron statue in front of Yue Fei's tomb in West Lake, you certainly won't mistake it for a childish "prank," right?

Let's take another example, an example that is a thousand years old: "When discussing the events of the Three Kingdoms, upon hearing of Liu Xuande's defeat, people would frown and shed tears; upon hearing of Cao Cao's defeat, they would rejoice and cheer." (See Su Shi's Notes). Why would people "rejoice and cheer" upon hearing of Cao Cao's defeat? Undoubtedly, because Cao Cao, in the eyes of the Chinese people throughout the ages, was a "villain." There were even stories of people getting so angry while watching a community opera performance in the countryside that they took a knife, ran onto the stage, and killed the actor playing Cao Cao.

Since education in China is not widespread and illiteracy is rampant, how has this latent historical consciousness become so prevalent and deeply ingrained in the broad masses of Chinese people? When this point is raised, we cannot forget, and must thank, a large group of unnamed folk educators in China for over a thousand years—the storytellers.

"Storytellers," also known as "talkers," generally speaking, probably started in the Tang Dynasty. It is said that the storytellers of the past could be divided into four categories, one of which specialized in telling stories from the Tongjian and the historical books of the Han and Tang dynasties. Chinese society is primarily agricultural. After the busy farming season, farmers have some free time. Therefore, under melon trellises or in small village teahouses, the sound of drums would quickly attract Zhang San and Li Si, barefooted and bare-chested, holding their dry tobacco pipes and sipping strong tea, as they listened intently to the story of "Yue Fei's Great Battle at Zhuxian Town." Zhang San and Li Si not only learned many principles of conduct, concepts of social ethics, and artistic evaluations from these stories, but also imprinted the consciousness of national history.

Today, storytellers are still quite common in remote rural areas and major cities. If these unnamed and neglected folk educators could be organized and trained, and instilled with some modern national consciousness and national concepts, so that they would not gradually devolve into low-level entertainment and could maximize the secondary function of social education in addition to their primary entertainment nature, then in these extraordinary times, this group of laborers and folk educators, neglected by society for over a thousand years, might not be a powerful new force in the surging tide of national movement.

Random Thoughts

### Face

— Jinchuan

The scholar-official class often talk about face. Even when they are so poor that they can barely breathe, they must not lose face. They must wear long gowns. They cut off flesh to mend sores, and eventually become slaves to face. How pitiful! But striving for face while lacking food and clothing is still considered noble. However, if they only care about the face of their long gowns and forget about the face of their own personality, then they are blinded by greed and will fall into the eighteenth level of hell. There are too many such people on the isolated island today. Commercial speculation and political prostitution are both painful to talk about. Too many people misunderstand face, often resulting in bloody conflicts. For example, if someone picks flowers in a park and another person interferes, the flower picker thinks they are losing face, so they argue, resulting in violence. This kind of phenomenon can be seen everywhere. Face is something that people need, but the world misunderstands it, eventually creating all kinds of evils. It is as if a monkey originally only has a monkey face, but a busybody insists on putting a human mask on it and dressing it in clothes, turning it into a joke.

This reminds me of a story recorded in the Old Book of Tang, Biography of Zhang Jun: "When Jun led troops to attack Taiyuan, Yang Fugong offered Jun a drink. Fugong said, 'Duke Bai holds forbidden troops, wields the great banner, and faces the enemy alone. Does he not understand Fugong's intentions and is just putting on a show of face?' Jun laughed and said, 'We will have face after the bandits are pacified.'" Zhang Jun truly understood face. We must reject all boring and hypocritical face and truly preserve our human dignity. "We will have face after the bandits are pacified." Let us firmly remember Zhang Jun's words!

— Modi

Dogs pant, trees droop their broad leaves.

I walk in the shade of the trees, experiencing the city that has already entered summer.

In the car, the chauffeur's silk sleeves flap, leaving tire marks on the asphalt road. I step on those marks as I cross the street.

The rickshaw puller wipes the sweat from his brow with the ragged clothes draped over his shoulders, and runs pulling the rickshaw with one hand. In the rickshaw, the tips of breasts jump under white clothing, the permed hair blows, and the colored umbrella on the head also shakes a little.

A heavily made-up woman is coming from the other side. In the evaporation of her sweat, I smell the fragrance of powder: Ah! This is the breath of summer overflowing in the upper-class woman!

I drag my feet, which have been standing for eight hours, and turn the corner.

A truck is empty. Four carters are pulling it slowly, their blue cloth backs covered with white salt stains. That is the summer color revealed in their work. They, like me, are wearily preparing to rest and restore energy for the next day's work.

Workers by the roadside are repairing the ditch. What does the smell of the ditch and the smell of sweat reveal about how summer is flowing in their environment?

A man, with his arm around a woman's waist; everyone covers their noses as they pass by, their eyes watching the cars coming and going in the road. I and the workers by the ditch watch the woman's bare legs. She enters a building with a gentle gait. It's a movie theater that is advertised in the newspaper every day, equipped with air conditioning. Men and women inside can snuggle together like in the spring.

I lower my head and walk, thinking of my wife and daughter waiting for me at home.

However, I am also aware that I am moving in life, on this homeward journey after work. It is still bright, the sun is still shining.

However, at this time, the sun has been swallowed up by distant tall buildings, and slowly, red, green, and white, distant neon lights and electric lights emit their light. I turn into that narrow and dirty alley.

The smell from the trash cans overflows with summer.

At the back door, a bald child already has flies on his head, and the mother uses a withered and yellow breast bag to feed him. The child's feces are probably on the ground, and flies are swarming around them.

This is summer. Summer reveals its ardent existence in every thing. Different things have their different forms of existence!

I enter the door. As soon as the landlady sees me, she asks for the rent. I immediately give her the wages I just received today.

Upstairs in the back, my wife squats on the ground to cook, and my daughter lies in bed, her yellow and thin body covered with red welts from mosquito bites.

I breathe in the summer of this back building, and I silently lie down on the bed.

### Napoleon's Tomb

— Written by Ingersoll, Translated by Pinpin

A moment ago, I stood beside old Napoleon's tomb, a splendid and magnificent tomb, fit for a god; I gazed at that rare marble coffin, where lies the ashes of that restless man? I leaned against the balcony, thinking of the career of this greatest warrior of the modern world.

I saw him walking by the Seine River, wanting to commit suicide. I saw him in Toulon. I saw him leading the masses into Paris. I saw him in front of the Italian army. I saw him crossing the Lodi Bridge, holding the tricolor flag. I saw him in the shadow of the pyramids in Egypt. I saw him conquering the Alps, mixing the French eagle with the eagles on the crags. I saw him in Marengo, Ulm, Austerlitz. I saw him in Russia, where snow infantry and wild wind cavalry scattered his troops like withered leaves in winter. I saw him in Leipzig, defeated and in a state of chaos, driven back to Paris by a hundred thousand gun barrels, captured like a wild beast, and exiled to Elba. I saw him escape, rebuilding an empire with his "genius." I saw him on the terrible battlefield of Waterloo, where "opportunity" and "fate" intertwined, destroying the one who had been their king. Then I saw him on St. Helena Island, with his hands behind his back, gazing at the melancholy and strange sea.

I thought of the countless orphans and widows he had created, of the tears shed for his "glory," and of the only woman who loved him but was pushed away from his heart by the cold hand of ambition.

Therefore, I said: "I would rather be a French peasant wearing wooden shoes. I would rather live in a thatched hut with grapes growing in front of the door, producing purple fruit under the loving kiss of the autumn sun. I would rather be this poor farmer, with my wife recognizing me at sunset and my children sitting on my knees, embracing me. I would rather be this person, ending in the silent tranquility of dreamless ashes. I do not want to be this embodiment of violence and assassination, Napoleon the Great."

He was the destroyer of nations, the destroyer of families and loved ones.

I believe in the hearthside. I believe in domestic democracy. I believe in the republicanism of family. I believe in freedom, equality, and fraternity.

Translator's note: Napoleon was an ambitious man and a warmonger, but his ambition led to his failure, and his warmongering led to his collapse. After reading this moving short article, ambitious men or warmongers should realize something, and we sufferers should rise up bravely and open a way out for ourselves.

### The Usually Strict Private Life of Norma Shearer Changes - Leading to a Love Triangle Scandal - The Scandalous Atmosphere Spreads Throughout Film City

— Shawi

George Raft, the husband of Virginia Bruce, the star of "Chained," which premiered at the Da Guangming Theater, has become Norma Shearer's lover since he met her last year. This fresh romance has become a common topic of conversation in Hollywood.

When George met Virginia, Virginia had already been a mother to a girl. George immediately fell in love, and not long after, she divorced her husband to marry George. Now, they have been together for seven years.

Last year, George took a trip to Europe, where he met Norma Shearer in Paris. Her beauty captivated George. When she traveled to South America, he followed her. In this way, a close friendship gradually developed between them, and their romance spread throughout the film city.

Since returning from this European tour, George seems to have lost interest in his original family and has been living alone outside.

Almost everyone knows about his sudden change of attitude toward his wife, so after Norma returned to New York, many reporters went to interview her. She said that they did have a deeper friendship because she admired Raft's rare and great spirit. From this, it is very clear that she is in love with George Raft.

This love entanglement is currently in progress, and the future outcome is naturally unpredictable. Now, let's briefly introduce the backgrounds and statuses of the three main characters:

Virginia Bruce's family is very conservative. She received the highest education and has a high status in society.

Norma Shearer sits in the top spot among American movie stars. Her private life has always been strict and respected by others.

Both of these women can be said to have property and status, but they have both fallen in love with George Raft. However, George himself is a bachelor. He used to be a dance partner in a small hotel in New York. Among his many noble friends, his background is the most humble. However, his demeanor is more elegant than many people who grew up in high society.

Virginia loved George very much, but he has now fallen in love with another woman. With both sides unwilling to let go, it is unknown how long their love triangle will continue before it is resolved.

### Continuing the Style of Hollywood Directors

(1) Robert Z. Leonard: He is skilled at directing musicals, especially Jeanette MacDonald's films. He pays special attention to small actions and is known for his lively and interesting style, unmatched by any other musical director in Hollywood. Representative works include "The Firefly" and "Maytime."

(2) Frank Lloyd: He is a director with a long history and extensive experience. His style is characterized by lightness and clarity. Representative works include "If I Were King" and "Cavalcade."

(3) Henry King: He likes to film historical films and has a habit of placing a grand scene at the end of the film. Viewers do not find his films dull, nor do they find history tasteless. His representative works include "In Old Chicago" and "Jesse James." His recent work is "Little Old New York," which has been shown at the Da Guangming Theater.

(4) Clarence Brown: His works have a lot of dialogue and not much in the way of grand scenes, but he likes to study clever details in his films. Representative works include "Ah, Wilderness!" and "The Rains Came."

(5) Frank Capra: This man is already famous in the world. He has relatively progressive political views, and all of his directed films are very meaningful, such as "Lost Horizon" and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." Many of Jean Arthur's films are directed by him, such as "You Can't Take It with You" and "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town." Capra is known for his concise, lively, and interesting style, and many of his directed films are listed among the top ten films, such as "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" in 1939, "You Can't Take It with You" in 1938, "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" in 1936, and "It Happened One Night" in 1935.

(6) Henry Van Dyke II: He can also be considered one of the great directors. He has a high position in Hollywood because he is very experienced. He likes to direct musicals, and he has directed more films starring MacDonald and Nelson Eddy than anyone else, but in my personal opinion, he is not as good as Robert Z. Leonard. However, Van Dyke's advantage lies in his natural introduction of grand scenes. His representative work is the Technicolor film "Sweethearts."

(Editor's note) The article "On the Style of Hollywood Directors" published on the 21st of this month under the name Xiande was found to be plagiarized. The fee for the manuscript has been cancelled.

Appropriate 100,000 - Awarding and Assisting Artists - Guo Moruo and Others Appointed as Custodial Committee Members

The suggestion to help literary artists was first proposed by the "Literary Association," and then echoed by various newspapers in Chongqing. This attracted the attention of the Ministry of Education, which believes that in today's world of increasingly high living costs, it is necessary to provide assistance to literary artists who do not have a fixed occupation. However, the scope should not be limited to literary artists, but should be expanded to other departments. This opinion has been agreed upon by relevant parties. It is heard that the central government has first allocated a special fund of 100,000 yuan, which will be used for the three purposes of "awards," "loans," and "assistance."

Regarding the custody of this fund, it has been decided to establish a "Literary Award and Assistance Fund Custodial Committee," with 21 members. In addition to representatives from various institutions serving as ex officio members, other experts will be hired to serve. The members have been largely determined as follows: (New Literature) Guo Moruo, Lao She, Wang Pingling, Hua Lin, Yao Pengzi, Hu Feng; (Old Literature) Lu Jiye; (Drama) Zhang Daofan, Hong Shen; (Film) Yang Hansheng, Sun Yu; (Journalist) Wang Yunsheng, Cheng Cangbo; (Music) Li Baozhen; (Painting and Sculpture) Xu Beihong, Lin Fengmian.

### The Significance of the New Play "Sea Love"

— Shi Yu

The emergence of "Sea Love" is a greater contribution than many common historical dramas that borrow bodies to revive souls. It is not only realistic, but also contains broader global significance.

The black claws plotting a southward advance have already seized the heart of the South Sea; the conspirators are alienating the Chinese overseas and the natives. At the same time, the ability to deceive superiors and subordinates is successfully carried out. Borrowing a knife to kill, inciting, and framing are all done to realize their dream of monopolizing the South Sea. "Sea Love" thoroughly exposes it.

However, in "Sea Love," the author does not only expose this conspiracy, but also points out how to strike and eliminate these conspiracies and ambitious men. The author points out that Chinese overseas should actively participate in serving the motherland, that Indian and Malayan people should actively assist in the liberation movement of the Chinese nation, and that the governments and people of the South Sea, mine owners and laborers, should cooperate to counter incitement, use unity to counter framing, and unanimously oppose the common enemy, the liars, robbers, and ambitious men who are plotting to advance south and seize hegemony. In fact, there is no other way for everyone. "Sea Love" points out this only way.

As for the writing skills of "Sea Love," in my opinion, they are sufficient to complete its writing task. I feel particularly pleased with the significance of "Sea Love" in new plays, which can soon be seen in the applause and tears of the audience.

### Retranslation of "Gone With the Wind" - Gone With the Wind

—

The colorful blockbuster "Gone With the Wind," which has been widely publicized by Chinese and foreign newspapers for a long time, has been rushed to Shanghai by MGM Pictures. It has already been test-screened once. The entire film is twenty-four reels long, divided into two parts, upper and lower. It requires three hours and forty-five minutes to screen. The Chinese translation has been carefully considered repeatedly and renamed "Gone With the Wind." It is elegant and popular, and can encompass the story of the entire film. The most distinctive feature of this film is that the overture and intermission music were specially filmed on celluloid for world premiere use. What is projected on the silver screen is a piece of light gray light, and the music is transmitted from the silver screen to the eardrums of every audience, creating a sense of ethereal fairy-like thought. As for the beauty of the color, it can be said to be the best of all color films to date. It is now reported that the Grand Cathay Theatre is scheduled to honorably present it at 8:00 p.m. on June 19th, and thereafter screen it twice daily.
