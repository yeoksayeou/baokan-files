### The Japanese Army Invading Northward Along the Yongbin Road Was Bitterly Defeated by the Chinese Army at Santang. The Japanese Retreat Southward in Two Routes, Leaving Behind 1,500 Corpses. The Chinese Have Crossed Sitang and Formed a Confrontational Situation with the Japanese.

Chongqing – The Chinese army recently engaged in three days and nights of bloody battle in Guinan, decisively defeating the Japanese and forcing them to retreat to Nanning, firmly controlling the advantageous battle situation against the remaining Japanese forces in Nanning. This victory was once again achieved by the brave Chinese soldiers. Regarding the details of the annihilation of the Japanese and the current situation, a certain military spokesperson told a Central News Agency reporter that on the morning of the 24th, the Japanese army, from Santang, advanced northward in two routes along both sides of the Yongbin Road area. Their strength consisted of 3,000 infantrymen, accompanied by numerous artillery, cavalry, and tanks. When the Japanese began their fierce offensive, the Chinese army maintained firm control of Sitang, Wutang, Liutang, and Qitang, and the Japanese did not dare to approach. They could only attempt to bypass them on both sides. The Chinese army's strength was roughly equal to that of the Japanese. When the Japanese advanced to both sides of Qitang, the Chinese army, using a pre-planned tactic to annihilate the Japanese, began to encircle them. After three days and nights of fierce division and combined attacks, the Japanese army completely collapsed. On the late night of the 26th, they began to retreat southward in two routes, leaving behind more than 1,500 corpses and over ten tanks along the way. On the 27th, they fled to the vicinity of Santang. The Chinese army pursued them valiantly, and on the same day, crossed Sitang, forming a confrontational situation with the Japanese. It has been verified that the Japanese suffered a devastating defeat this time, with extremely heavy losses. As a result, they not only failed to attack the major strongholds on the Chinese highway but also had their ability to re-equip severely decimated by the Chinese. Consequently, they had no choice but to abandon their deceitful attack plan and remain trapped in the encirclement of the Chinese's impregnable defenses. (29th Dispatch)

Guilin – There are no changes in the battle situation on the Yongbin and Yongwu Roads. (29th Dispatch)

Chongqing – According to a Chinese military spokesperson today, the recent enveloping maneuver by the Japanese army in Nanning towards the northwest of Nanning has completely failed. Three thousand Japanese soldiers, using horses, artillery, tanks, and airplanes as cover, have now been forced to retreat to Santang. The Japanese's action was originally intended to reach Batang, 28 miles northwest of Nanning, hoping to cut off the Chinese transportation line beyond Batang. Since the Japanese army retreated to Santang, the area northwest of Nanning has returned to peace and quiet. At the same time, torrential rain in that area is also one of the reasons for the cessation of hostilities. Furthermore, the spokesperson said that in the past week, the Japanese army in Nanning had extended towards Annam twice. The first time was on February 22nd, when 2,000 Japanese soldiers occupied Funan. The second time was on the 25th of this month, when the Japanese army attacked Shangsi, 30 miles southwest of the Yongqin Highway. The Chinese army repelled the attack on Funan on the 23rd, with the Japanese suffering 500 casualties. The attack on Shangsi was repelled by the Chinese on the 26th. Regarding the Japanese claim that 200,000 Chinese soldiers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui had been surrounded by the Japanese army, the spokesperson considered it "preposterous propaganda by the Japanese," as the Chinese army's strength in that area was not as large as claimed. As for the Japanese army's casualties in this region last week, they were approximately 800. (29th Dispatch)

Editorial

### The Bright Future of the Shanghai French Concession

The fundamental destiny of the various concessions within China depends on the success or failure of China's war of resistance and national reconstruction, that is, it is most effectively and properly guaranteed by China's victory in the war of resistance and the completion of national reconstruction. It depends on the ideas and actions of the countries of the concessions towards China, whether they are friendly or not, that is, everything concerning China, with the countries respecting treaties and justice as an inevitable obligation. The rise and fall of the concessions depend on whether the concession authorities can care for the welfare of the majority of residents in the concession, that is, it depends on whether the concession authorities can gain the love and cooperation of the majority of residents in the concession. I believe that this is a permanently applicable law; and it can be tested and proven to be accurate at all times and in all things.

Over the years, we have repeatedly discussed the Shanghai concessions, and we have not been able to help but make suggestions, whether they are implemented or not, effective or not. However, considering the extreme difficulties of the current environment of the concessions and the concession authorities, we often tolerate and remain silent about the negligence or impropriety of the measures taken, let alone demanding perfection. If the measures taken are beneficial to the welfare of the majority of residents in the concession, we are happy to promote them and stand behind them. In mid-December of last year, the authorities of both the Public Concession and the French Concession jointly issued a notice in the hope of curbing hoarding and speculation in the rice market. We expressed our gratitude for their sincerity, but we only placed our hope on its short-term effectiveness. We thought that the price of rice was only one aspect of the food problem, and food was only one aspect of the general living problem. Curbing the soaring price of rice was certainly beneficial to the residents, but we hoped that the concession authorities would take further action. Taking action is indeed difficult, but it is essential to make great aspirations and persevere with determination. Eighty days have passed since then, and the facts show that a firm determination will certainly have a certain effect; but the heartbreaking phenomena currently seen show that the difficulties still exist, and it is not easy to overcome them with determination. We were wavering between sympathy and disappointment with the concession authorities when we suddenly heard that the French Concession had publicly announced the establishment of a Committee for the Evaluation of the Prices of Goods in the French Concession by the Consulate General. The articles of association were published in detail in yesterday's newspaper. According to the articles of association, the responsibilities of this committee are to 'assess the prices of daily necessities and to eliminate speculation, manipulation, and monopoly.' Such an organization and such a motivation are unprecedented in the concession. The explicit provision that 'the rights and interests of producers and distributors, and the protection of consumers, should be considered together' shows that it is not intended to use authority to oppress and exploit the legitimate profits of industry and commerce; it is intended to enable residents to live in peace and businesses to prosper. The assessment of prices has fair and clear basic standards, which cannot be arbitrarily adjusted by those involved. The preparation for the evaluation includes detailed and appropriate investigation procedures, which do not allow for rash arbitrariness or the use of convenience for private gain. It allows for changes in evaluation to adapt to the market. It enforces mandatory sales to eliminate hoarding and monopoly. For those who disobey in public but obey in private, those who engage in empty sales, those who seek profits outside of their business, those who set up private markets, those who provide false evidence, and those who conceal inventory, the main perpetrators and accomplices will be punished accordingly. All of these clauses not only benefit consumers, but also provide practical protection for legitimate and law-abiding industries and businesses. The goods confiscated for violations and the fines collected for breaking the law will be used for the poor in the concession; this further shows that this measure is by no means a means for the concession authorities to accumulate wealth, but rather for the welfare of the majority of residents in the concession. This is truly a glorious creation and a wise measure by the French Concession authorities; it will certainly be sincerely supported by the majority of residents, who will pray for its great and remarkable effectiveness. If so, which people who seek a stable life would not be happy to live in the French Concession; which consumers would not be happy to buy in the French Concession; which legitimate industries and businesses would not be happy to operate in the French Concession; whether the future of the French Concession will be good or bad, prosperous or declining, what is the need to consult a fortune teller!

This is not just a temporary emotional impulse that leads us to promote it enthusiastically and pray for it well; this is not excessive praise. There is a natural reason and the trend will inevitably lead to it. Who does not enjoy profit, and even more, enjoys large profits, and especially enjoys exorbitant profits? If one can get exorbitant profits, then get exorbitant profits; if one cannot get exorbitant profits, then get large profits; if one cannot get large profits, then settle for small profits; if small profits are certain, then accumulating small profits will also become large profits, so small profits are still valuable. This is the normal principle of free and fair business. Is it not common to see that many shops use "small profits and quick turnover" as their business policy, as a slogan to attract customers? The rationale is the same. The current major drawback and problem of the commercial market in the Shanghai concessions is the unreasonable, unconscionable, and unjustified raising of prices to seize exorbitant profits. This legislation in the French Concession is to curb the unreasonable price increases. After the legislation, it may cause those who are determined to make exorbitant profits to withdraw from the French Concession; however, the market, the city houses, the foundation, the expenses, the personnel, etc., have their natural limitations and their necessary factors. Even if they try to seize exorbitant profits elsewhere, it will be difficult for everyone to withdraw and for every family to move elsewhere. Those law-abiding industries and businesses that remain in the French Concession will have bustling businesses because the selling price is not as exorbitant as that outside the concession, and large profits will return from small profits. Thus, the French Concession will become a prosperous and normal commercial market. Customers will inevitably flock to lower prices, and goods will inevitably follow customers; if one seeks exorbitant profits and carries their goods to move in the opposite direction of customers, we truly do not know what they will gain.

We assert that this legislation in the Shanghai French Concession will be greatly and remarkably effective, but we also hope that it will be effective and remarkable quickly. Therefore, we hope that the French Concession authorities will grasp the determination with perseverance and魄力, that the evaluation committee will jointly plan for soundness with precision and correctness, that the industries and businesses in the French Concession will sacrifice temporary exorbitant profits and slowly accumulate small profits into large profits, and that the Public Concession will quickly catch up and keep pace with the French Concession.

### The American Ambassador Arrives in Chongqing Yesterday, Escorted by Ten Chinese Soldiers Along the Way, Taking the Sichuan-Yunnan Road, A Five-Day Journey

Chongqing – American Ambassador Johnson arrived here from Kunming after a five-day journey. He arrived here just after noon today. The ambassador was dressed in travel clothes and covered in dust. Because he had not dressed up for five days, his face was covered with dust. The ambassador's party included Assistant Naval Attaché Major MacRea, Chief Justice Helmick of the American Court in China, and Ambassador's Secretary Lai Fang. They were the first group of officials to travel on the newly opened Sichuan-Yunnan Road on February 1st. Their outer clothing was quite eye-catching, each wearing a blue cloth hat purchased from Vietnam, and several of them had knives and chopsticks hanging from their waists. According to them, the new road is a great engineering achievement, winding through mountains over 7,000 feet high, but it still needs several months of repair before it can be fully used. The ambassador's party was accompanied by a guard of honor of Chinese soldiers along the way, and each province dispatched a truckload of soldiers to escort them along the way to the provincial border. Those who went to welcome them when they arrived in Chongqing included American Ambassador Counselor Baker, representatives from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and other representatives of the American community. A large number of journalists also came to the scene. Everyone had been waiting at Taipingmen on the north bank of the Yangtze River since noon, because the Chinese authorities had received a telegram from the ambassador stating that he would arrive in Chongqing at 1:00 PM, but the telegram to the embassy after the ambassador left Kunming stated that he would arrive at noon. According to reports, the ambassador's party stayed overnight in Yongchuan last night. (29th Reuters Dispatch)

### British Warship Sends Nine Germans to Yokohama

Yokohama – Nine of the twenty-one Germans seized by the British from the Asama Maru arrived here this morning at 7:00 AM on the British auxiliary cruiser HMS Canberra (10,985 tons) and have been handed over to the Japanese authorities. Among the Japanese officials was a section chief from the European Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accompanied by British Naval Attaché Colonel Dufnell, who took a ferry to the British warship. At around 8:00 AM, they took over the nine Germans handed over by the British. At 10:10 AM, they disembarked at the main wharf in Yokohama. The Germans were then sent to the Immigration Office to check their passports. About fifty Japanese news reporters and photographers, the German Consul-General in Yokohama, and several German reporters gathered at the wharf. About 300 Japanese people also gathered outside the gate of the Immigration Office. However, the Germans were not allowed to speak to the news reporters. According to a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all procedures were carried out very smoothly, and the courtesy and sincerity of the British officers were commendable. The Germans were handed over to the German Consul-General at 12:30 PM and were reportedly staying at a hotel for the time being. The British warship HMS Canberra left Yokohama at 10:30 AM this morning. It is noteworthy that the handover of the Germans was handled by the captain of the British warship and the representative of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Japanese Navy did not participate, because it is believed that this case was negotiated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (29th Reuters)

Hong Kong – A communiqué issued here today stated that the British warship HMS Canberra arrived outside Yokohama Port this morning and landed nine Germans taken off the Asama Maru.

### The Japanese Side Begins to Monopolize Materials in the Occupied Areas of Central China. Materials Related to Military Use are Banned from Export.

Osaka – The Osaka Municipal Bureau of Industry has learned that the Japanese authorities in Central China have begun to restrict or absolutely prohibit the transportation of certain materials produced in the occupied areas to Shanghai or non-occupied areas, as these materials are crucial for military purposes. This policy aims to obtain a sufficient supply of important materials needed by Japan from China. The banned items include various iron materials, bronze, brass, and tinware, coal, ramie, raw cotton, leather, vegetable oil, pig bristles, and tea. In addition to establishing companies to purchase these products and transport them to Japan, the Japanese authorities are also giving special treatment to several important Japanese companies to purchase these products. Companies such as the Japan Iron Company, the Central China Mining Company, the Central South Coal Mining Company, the Central China Raw Cotton Federation, the Central China Export Cotton Weaving Company, and the Central China Export Merchants Federation all enjoy this special privilege. According to the Japan Times, although these companies enjoy special privileges, they will also suffer serious setbacks if the Yangtze River is opened for general traffic, as Chinese and third-country industries and businesses in the Yangtze River basin enjoy the advantages of huge capital, long history, and a solid foothold. Therefore, Japanese companies should merge into powerful special groups, supplied by the Japanese government with huge capital, to control the various industrial and commercial institutions in the Japanese-occupied areas of China and enable them to cope with competition. In order to monopolize exports from Central China, the Japanese plan to establish a Japanese Ramie Company and a financial institution composed of major Japanese banks, with a loan of 25 million Japanese yen to the Central China Promotion Company. At the same time, the East Asia Shipping Company, as one of the Japanese "national policy" companies subsidized by the government, has a capital of 75 million Japanese yen and was established in August of last year by the Japanese Ministry of Communications and ten Japanese shipping companies to operate between China and Japan, along the coast, and on China's inland rivers. It is now heard that business is very good and the future is promising. (29th Reuters Dispatch)

### US House Passes Export-Import Bank Capital Increase, Opening Lending Paths to China, Finland, and South American Countries

Washington - A bill to increase the capital of the Federal Export-Import Bank by $100 million to provide credit loans to China and Finland was recently passed by the Senate. The House of Representatives has now approved it by a majority of 168 votes to 51. However, there are two points of discrepancy with the original bill passed by the Senate, which need to be adjusted before it can be submitted to President Roosevelt for approval and enactment into law. In addition, during the House's discussion of this bill today, a motion was proposed by a member to lend $20 million to Finland without restrictions on its use (referring to allowing its use for purchasing military supplies). This was ultimately rejected by the House by a vote of 106 to 49. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

Washington - Following the approval by both the Senate and the House of Representatives of the bill to increase the capital of the Federal Export-Import Bank by $100 million, China, Finland, and various Latin American countries can now obtain credit loans from the bank to purchase various agricultural tools, industrial manufactured goods, and raw materials from the United States. The House's discussion today particularly focused on the issue of financial assistance to Finland. Previously, applications to the Federal Export-Import Bank for loans to purchase aircraft, whether military or civilian, were generally not approved. Now, the House of Representatives has removed the restrictions on civilian aircraft. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

### US Plans to Build Naval Base in Central America

Washington - According to political sources here, after President Roosevelt's inspection of the Panama Canal Zone, he plans to build a US naval base in Culebra Bay on the west coast of Costa Rica. It is said that the United States signed a treaty with Nicaragua in 1913, obtaining the right to build a naval base in the Gulf of Fonseca. However, this was opposed by Honduras and El Salvador, so President Roosevelt adopted the plan for the Culebra Bay naval base. (Haitong dispatch, 29th)

Washington - US Republican Congressman Gass yesterday introduced a resolution to the House of Representatives, requesting the government to obtain land bases on the northern coast of South America or nearby islands to strengthen the defense of the Panama Canal and defend against military actions by non-American countries. The construction of these bases would be the same as those already built on the island of Puerto Rico. (United Press dispatch, 29th)

### Japan Purchases Wheat from the US

New York - After the US wheat export subsidy program was recently restored by the federal government, coastal states in the US wheat region have sold 300,000 bushels of wheat to Japan, with the federal government subsidizing three cents per bushel. It is reported that this wheat will be shipped to various ports in China. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

### Secretary of State Hull Discusses the Nature of International Talks: Merely a Broad Investigative Effort

Washington - Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement to newspaper reporters, stating that regarding the US government's separate talks with neutral countries, the statement he recently issued has been communicated to various countries through diplomatic channels and was not limited to neutral countries. The main point of this statement is to advocate for disarmament and greater trade freedom as a basis for improving the world situation. As for the talks conducted by the US government, they are merely a broad-ranging investigative effort and have no connection with the current war in Europe, and should not be seen as an attempt at mediation. According to his personal impression, all neutral governments that have had contact with the US government have responded favorably to this investigation. However, he cannot disclose at this time whether any of these governments have made suggestions. In short, what the US government seeks is that after the end of the war, the world's economic life will no longer be controlled by self-sufficiency or other forms of autarky, so that suggestions can be made on a solid and sound basis. Therefore, all forces working for peace and stability should be organized so that they can enter a period of peaceful reconstruction once the state of war ends. If this can be achieved, economic self-sufficiency and totalitarianism will no longer be in the position they were in after the last war. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

### Welles Travels from Italy to Germany; No Formal Visit During Swiss Stopover; Prospects for Peace Mediation Plan Dim

Zurich, Switzerland - US Undersecretary of State Welles, traveling by train from Rome to Berlin, arrived here this evening. US Consul General Fross met him at the station, and crowds gathered to cheer him. According to well-informed sources, Welles' transit through Switzerland is purely private and he is not prepared to hold talks with Swiss government officials. This can be seen from the fact that the Swiss government did not send a representative to welcome him. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

Soleure, Switzerland - US Undersecretary of State Welles arrived here last night, and a large crowd gathered at the station to cheer him. After arriving, Welles took a car directly to his hotel to rest before traveling to Berlin after his visit to Rome. It seems there is no issue of Welles holding special talks in Switzerland. Welles will depart for Berlin this afternoon on a sleeper car specially prepared by the German government. It is expected that after spending two or three days in Germany, Welles will return to Paris and London via Switzerland, and finally return to Rome, where he will take a ship from Naples back to New York. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

Berlin - Here, some in political circles have lost hope that US Undersecretary of State Welles' tour of European capitals might yield some kind of peace mediation plan. This is because German newspapers have published articles authorized by the authorities, denying British reports that Chancellor Hitler has considered submitting a peace proposal to the US special envoy. German newspapers are all framing the destruction of the British Empire as Germany's war aim. The "Political Newspaper" claims that Germany can envision peace, harmony, and friendship among nations, but the tyrant must be expelled from all parts of the world. The disappearance of the tyrant is a prerequisite for freedom of the seas and for correcting centuries of injustice. This terror must first be shattered so that constructive nations can cooperate harmoniously. One newspaper denounced the peace proposal as "lying, brazen, arrogant, and unconscious deception, providing unlimited entertainment for every German." Another newspaper claimed that Germany's goal is war, war until victory, war until the destruction of the London financiers who constantly threaten the world with new wars. The leader and the German people hope that the tyranny and oppression of other peoples by Britain can end. (United Press dispatch, 29th)

### Japanese House of Representatives Debates Policy Toward the US; Foreign Minister Arita Answers Questions from Members; Trade Ministry Proposal Also a Topic of Discussion

Tokyo - During today's session of the House of Representatives, someone asked Foreign Minister Arita whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would yield to the will of the United States regarding the current state of no treaty between the US and Japan. Arita replied that even if the United States completely opposes the construction of a new order in East Asia, does not understand Japan's objectives in China, or even insists that Japan should accept its views on the matter, Japan will not be afraid. But the current situation has not yet reached this point. Arita reiterated that he has no intention of adopting a perfunctory policy to negotiate a temporary agreement on a US-Japan treaty on the condition of reopening the Yangtze River. From the standpoint of an autonomous Japan, this or any other outstanding issue will be resolved properly. He cannot be sure of the US government's thinking, but if its true intention is to reject Japan's objectives and the war, and unless Japan withdraws its objectives, there will be nothing to adjust in US-Japan relations, then Japan will express a firm attitude towards the policy being implemented. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

### Turkey Strengthens National Defense, Receives Aid from Britain and France

London - Diplomatic circles here have recently received news that the Turkish government is taking precautionary measures in all areas and obtaining various forms of assistance from Britain and France. In addition, the British and French "Eastern Army" has already been formed. From Turkey's Edirne to Egypt and from the Mediterranean coast to Afghanistan, defenses are extremely strong. Whether Germany or the Soviet Union attempts aggression, they will be unable to achieve their goals. At this moment, the training and equipment of the Turkish army is becoming increasingly advanced. In addition to the fact that the Bosphorus Strait area has already been actively equipped with air defense equipment and residents have prepared to evacuate, measures have also been taken to defend against the Soviet Union in the direction of Artvin. The general public in Turkey is increasingly suspicious of the Soviet Union, believing that Russian imperialism, which has long threatened Turkey's Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits as its traditional policy, has now been revived. Because of these things, if relations between Britain and France and the Soviet Union become increasingly tense to the point of rupture, then Turkey will surely be a strong arm of Britain and France. In addition, Britain and France are providing assistance to the weaker resisting forces in the Near East in order to contain the Soviet Union and prevent it from advancing southward, that is, to contain the Soviet Union's expansion of power toward India. Countries such as Iran will receive loans of £5 million to £6 million from the United States, and Afghanistan is also reorganizing its defenses in preparation for the Soviet Union.

### Soviet and Finnish Armies Contend for Vyborg; Canadian Volunteers Arrive in Finland; Son of Former President Will Also Go to Finland to Command; Soviet Communiqué Claims Occupation of Forty-Two Fortresses

Stockholm, Sweden - Finnish and Soviet forces fought fiercely all day yesterday, contesting Vyborg. Finnish artillery shelled Soviet troops around Vyborg Bay, and newly arrived foreign aircraft heavily bombed Soviet lines, dropping bombs on Soviet tanks, artillery, and soldiers on the ice, causing them to sink into the water. Experts in Helsinki believe that Finnish forces will be able to continue to hold Vyborg because it is easier to defend. Last night, the temperature rose, and people hoped that the weather would turn bad and hinder the Soviet advance. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

Helsinki - According to sources here, as of February 26, the Soviet army had lost a total of 1,288 tanks. The intensity of the artillery fire at Vyborg is now unprecedented since the start of the war. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

Moscow - According to a communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, Soviet forces continued to make progress in the Karelian sector yesterday. The enemy repeatedly attempted counterattacks to stop the Soviet advance, but were repelled and suffered heavy casualties. They are now continuing to retreat. Soviet troops occupied enemy fortresses on the north bank of the Salmenkaitajoki River, and also occupied the villages of Riitesaari (west bank of Lake Viiksinselkä), Markkila, Hamanijoenmi, and Heikkila (north of Lake Kalajärvi). Hanjoki, 6 kilometers south of Vyborg, and Kamara, 4 kilometers southwest of Yalski Station, were also occupied by Soviet troops. According to unverified statistics, Soviet forces captured a total of forty-two enemy fortresses yesterday. There were no major developments in other sectors. The Soviet Air Force only conducted reconnaissance flights due to bad weather. (TASS dispatch, 29th)

Helsinki - The Finnish General Headquarters issued an official report yesterday stating that Finnish forces in Karelia held their ground and inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviet army. Artillery battles were extremely fierce. An enemy attack northeast of Lake Ladoga was repelled, and several Soviet units were annihilated. The Finnish Air Force was unusually active yesterday, flying to enemy positions to reconnoiter and bomb several military targets. The Soviet Air Force concentrated on the Karelian Isthmus and northeast of Lake Ladoga, and bombed Petsamo, but the damage was minimal. (Haitong dispatch, 29th)

London - Sir Dukie, the British Information Minister at the British Embassy in Sweden, recently returned here from the Finnish war zone. According to him today, the Soviet Union has suffered 500,000 casualties in the three months of the war against Finland. 100,000 have died on the Eastern Mannerheim Line alone. As for the tanks captured and destroyed by Finland, the total is between 1,100 and 1,500. 500 aircraft have been shot down by the Finnish side. But although the Soviet Union's losses are heavy, it still has a strong combat capability, because the Soviet Union can easily mobilize an army of 10 million to 15 million. Finally, he hoped that Britain could increase its assistance to Finland with arms and ammunition. (United Press dispatch, 29th)

London - Danish Radio relayed news from a Norwegian newspaper, claiming that the damage caused by Soviet air raids on Finland totaled 20 billion Finnish marks. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

Helsinki - Last night, radio announced that the first batch of Canadian volunteers had arrived in Finland. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

London - Three hundred Hungarians have already passed through London on their way to Finland to assist in the war. Only an advance unit of British volunteers has departed for Finland today, while the main force of several hundred will depart later. It is reported that thousands have applied to volunteer, including some women and older people. Hundreds have been selected by the Finnish International Volunteer Army in Finland to supply clothing, equipment, and transportation to and from Finland, as well as living expenses in Finland. The Finnish government is responsible for the cost of raising foreign troops in Finland. It is estimated that the cost borne by the Finnish office is £200 per person. The office is now eager to raise more funds to cope with the situation. British volunteers are given a daily allowance of two shillings, those injured are entitled to allowances, and the families of those who die are entitled to compensation. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

Amsterdam - Kermit Roosevelt, son of former US President Theodore Roosevelt and relative of current President Roosevelt, is currently serving as an officer in the British army.

### Norway Decides to Maintain Strict Neutrality in the Soviet-Finnish War; Britain Negotiates with Nordic Countries to Increase Quota of Transiting Volunteers

Oslo - According to Norwegian Foreign Minister Goode, speaking to a United Press reporter today, Norway's attitude toward the Soviet-Finnish war is exactly the same as Sweden's, that is, non-intervention. Norway's decision is based on the same belief expressed by the King of Sweden, namely, the deep conviction that intervention in the Soviet-Finnish war will expose the entire Scandinavia to great danger and involve the Scandinavian countries in the vortex of the European war. As for the dispatch of volunteers and the raising of donations, these are nothing more than due to humanitarian considerations and are also an expression of sympathy for Finland. He also said that Norway and Sweden are taking a strict neutral stance. When asked by a reporter whether the Soviet Union might exert pressure on Norway after conquering Finland, the Norwegian Foreign Minister declined to comment, only saying, "I can clearly state that, from a historical point of view, the Soviet Union will not make any demands on Norway." (United Press dispatch, 29th)

Oslo - At today's meeting of the House of Representatives, Conservative Party leader Hambro first made a speech, strongly emphasizing Norway's determination to maintain neutrality. Foreign Minister Goode then spoke, saying in brief, "Since the outbreak of the European war, Norwegian ships have often been sunk by warships of belligerent countries. The nationality of these warships is sometimes difficult to ascertain. There have also been those that have sunk after hitting mines, and it is not known which country laid these mines. Therefore, if our government wants to lodge a protest, it must do so to both belligerent parties at the same time." (Havas dispatch, 29th)

London - The Scandinavian Peninsula countries originally stipulated that no more than 300 volunteers per day could transit through their countries to Finland. According to well-informed sources here, the British government is negotiating with these countries to increase this quota. In addition, it is heard that the Finnish government does not welcome Polish volunteers, believing that their joining the Finnish army will make Germany feel dissatisfied. But as a matter of fact, since Polish territory has been invaded by the Soviet Union, Poles have no legal reason to maintain neutrality in the Finnish-Soviet war. Therefore, it is very appropriate to send a Polish volunteer division to Finland to assist in the war. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

### Swedish Parliament Approves Strengthening Air Defense; Adds Four Squadrons of Aircraft

It is heard that the pilots have managed to escape into France and are returning to serve in the British Air Force. When the pilots were detained, they did not give their word of honor not to escape. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

London - British aircraft have repeatedly flown to Germany for reconnaissance recently without encountering interception. The Daily Express recently published the opinions of aviation experts, suggesting three reasons as follows: (1) Certain areas of Germany have been designated as strategic areas, equipped with large-caliber heavy artillery and searchlights. The German military authorities want to keep these air defense mechanisms secret, so they are reserved for use during a large-scale air raid by British bombers in the future, but they are not worth using against reconnaissance planes at present. (2) The use of anti-aircraft artillery would interfere with the activities of factories in industrial areas, so it will only be used to counter the enemy when these areas are bombed. (3) The German authorities do not want to cause panic among the people. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

### British Fleet Concentrates in Waters Off Uruguay; Rumors of Impending Naval Battle; Wreck of the Graf Spee Sold

New York - The New York Times recently published a dispatch from a reporter stationed in Montevideo, Uruguay, stating that the British fleet is concentrated in the waters near the mouth of the Plata River. The British cruiser HMS Hawkins (9,800 tons) sailed into Montevideo last night to refuel.

(Havas dispatch, 29th)

### Austrian Mountain Range of the Dolomites: Germany Builds Defenses, Rumored to be Against Italian Attacks; Belgium About to Close German Border

Swiss Capital: A Havas correspondent, recently arriving from the former Austrian border, reports that Germany is constructing fortifications in the Dolomites mountain range at the junction of the former Austrian provinces of Carinthia, Styria, and Salzburg. The workforce consists of 70,000 people, primarily Polish prisoners and German military engineers. Furthermore, reports from Judenburg indicate that underground airfields are being built near the cities of Fohnsdorf and Mautern, with large quantities of munitions and aircraft being continuously transported to the Italian border. Residents in these areas have received official notices to prepare for evacuation if necessary, causing great anxiety, as these military preparations are seen as defensive measures against potential Italian attacks. (Havas, 28th)

Belgian Town of Eupen: According to reliable sources, the border between Germany and Belgium will be closed starting on the first of next month. Local authorities have already ceased issuing permits for residents and workers who need to cross into Germany daily. In Aachen, Germany, authorities have ordered all bakeries to stockpile enough flour to last three months, reportedly due to transportation difficulties. (Havas, 29th)

### Eden's Speech: No Armistice, Strive for Final Victory

London: Dominions Secretary Eden, speaking in Liverpool today, stated that Hitlerism and the international gang of thugs who support it have now been completely defeated and captured. They can no longer ensure their safety, and there is no hope for the future. Any armistice, any superficial mediation that you may encounter, will, if we disregard the significant danger, only lead to even greater danger in a few months or years, and then it will be too late to regret. If we engage in mediation to resolve disputes with those whose only belief is barbarous force and whose only means is trampling, we will inevitably regress into the Dark Ages. Rest and recuperation this autumn and winter would indeed greatly benefit Britain, allowing us to prepare. However, if we forget the essential lesson that only the victory in the final act of war constitutes the enemy's defeat, then our preparations will not only fail to comfort us but will even lead to danger. These past few months have allowed us time to forge weapons, and once these weapons are ready, they will be used to effectively eliminate the enemy. (Reuters, 29th)

### British Ship Runs Aground, Swedish Ship Sunk

### Chamberlain Delivers Speech, Advocates Rural Production, Cabinet Will Back Farmers, Prevent Post-War Agricultural Collapse

London: Prime Minister Chamberlain addressed chairmen of War Agricultural Executive Committees from various British districts yesterday, urging them to vigorously promote rural production. He said that the nation is now being transformed into a large armaments factory, and therefore the shipping industry bears a heavy responsibility. Although shipping losses are significant, they are insignificant compared to the overall volume of shipping. Adopting plans to enhance our security is essential, but these plans are not economically sound in themselves. Besides the amount of shipping at our disposal, we also face a factor limiting imports, which is our foreign exchange strength. To overcome this difficulty, we must increase domestic food production. Some say the government's target of two million acres is too low, but we believe that two million acres is the highest figure attainable. We face some difficulties due to unfavorable weather, but if everyone works hard, we should still be able to reach this target. The War Cabinet will support farmers' efforts to increase production. He has asked the Lord Privy Seal to personally participate in this campaign. He has heard that some farmers are currently hesitant to plant more turnips for fear that there will not be enough labor to harvest them. He can provide them with a firm guarantee that the government will take any necessary steps to ensure that the harvested agricultural products will be harvested. As for the notion that farmers' treatment is inferior to that of factory workers, he wishes to firmly deny it. However, the funds available for subsidies are limited, and the evils of prices and wages chasing each other are undesirable. The government has now decided on the future status of agriculture after the war. If the current government is still in power after the war, it will never allow the tragedy of agricultural collapse after the last war to be repeated in the future. (Reuters, 29th)

### Anglo-Italian Relations in a Delicate Phase

Paris: The Times' Rome correspondent reports that the economic relations between Britain and Italy have reached a delicate phase, as talks over the past few weeks have failed to produce mutually satisfactory compromises on outstanding issues. Italy's coal supply currently comes mostly from Germany, and this issue is a major obstacle in the negotiations. Italy is willing to exchange agricultural products for British coal, but Britain prefers Italian heavy industrial products. Britain has also expressed its intention to prohibit the export of German coal currently transported to Italy by sea, which may exacerbate the difficulties between the two countries. It is noted that the Allied Powers have traditionally granted preferential treatment to Italy during the blockade against Germany. Italian news reports claim that if Britain purchases heavy industrial goods, Italian industry will soon be dominated by Britain. (Reuters, 29th)

### Britain Uncovers German Espionage Case

London: According to news from here today, Britain recently discovered an espionage case. The arrested individual is a 25-year-old German national named Sülf. Reportedly, Sülf resided in the home of a high-ranking official in the Ministry of Supply, from where he had a clear view of the Royal Air Force station in Abingdon. It was discovered that Sülf was secretly photographing damaged British aircraft at the airbase when he was spotted by a four-year-old Italian girl. This led to his arrest by the British authorities. Under interrogation, it was learned that Sülf had served in the cavalry under the Nazi regime and had also worked in a German aircraft factory. He had also studied at Oxford University in England. In 1939, he returned to Germany once and returned to England before the outbreak of the European war. The Abingdon local court has sentenced Sülf to one month in prison. However, various public groups have expressed dissatisfaction with this sentence, considering it too lenient, and have telegraphed members of Parliament, urging them to tighten restrictions on the activities of enemy aliens. There are currently 70,000 German nationals in Britain. It is said that while not all of these German nationals are spies, they all have relatives in Germany, so there is concern that if they are subjected to pressure, they will fulfill their espionage responsibilities for Germany. (United Press, 29th)

### British House of Commons Discusses Palestine Issue, Attlee Accuses Government of Acting Unilaterally

London: During the House of Commons session this afternoon, opposition Labour Party leader Major Attlee raised questions regarding the Palestine issue. Colonial Secretary MacDonald replied, "The regulations for the administration of non-Arab residential areas drafted by our High Commissioner in Palestine have been finalized and will be published this afternoon. As for the annual report submitted by the League of Nations Mandates Commission, the Council of the League of Nations has been unable to discuss it due to the international situation. However, our government has sent the aforementioned regulations and a memorandum to the Council, providing them for reference should any member state request a discussion on the matter. At the same time, the full text of these regulations, as well as the government's letter to the Secretariat of the League of Nations and the memorandum, will be published in a White Paper this afternoon." Major Attlee then expressed his opposition, stating that the government's unilateral actions, disregarding the League of Nations' views, have caused a loss of confidence in all parties. MacDonald replied that the government had no intention of disregarding the League of Nations' views. If the Council of the League of Nations wishes to discuss this matter, the government is ready to attend the meeting and submit a report. (Havas, 28th)

### Daladier Reports on Foreign Affairs in the Chamber of Deputies

Paris: During this afternoon's meeting of the Chamber of Deputies' Foreign Affairs Committee, Prime Minister Daladier attended and delivered a speech reporting on military and foreign affairs. He also touched on the issue of Japanese aircraft bombing the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, stating that the Japanese government had promised France to compensate for the damages. The Foreign Affairs Committee issued a communique afterward stating, "Prime Minister Daladier first reported on the situation on the Western Front, commenting on the various incidents caused by Germany's repeated threats to Belgium and the Netherlands. He also reviewed the various issues arising from the war between Finland and the Soviet Union, stating that Britain and France have supplied Finland with a large amount of military supplies. It is true that the Red Army has gained some victories in the Karelian Isthmus of Finland due to the disparity in strength between the Finnish and Soviet forces, but France should continue to provide assistance to Finland. Furthermore, the recent meeting of the Balkan Entente in the Yugoslav capital has yielded good results. As a result of Turkey's many diplomatic activities, the situation in the Balkan Peninsula has improved, and the relations between Romania and Bulgaria have also improved. Regarding the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway by Japanese aircraft, the Japanese government has promised to compensate for the damages. As for the German situation, it may be premature to say that the country is on the verge of collapse, but the domestic difficulties are indeed numerous. Although the country's propaganda organs are trying to cover it up, they often achieve the opposite effect. Finally, Prime Minister Daladier, with great confidence, listed the reasons for France's inevitable victory, which was greeted with applause from all the deputies. After the Prime Minister finished speaking, several deputies raised questions on various issues, especially the mission of US Undersecretary of State Welles to Europe, France's interests in the Far East, and the negotiations conducted by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in the spring of last year. The Prime Minister answered each question individually. The chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mistralet, then thanked the Prime Minister on behalf of the committee for his objective and faithful report." (Havas, 28th)

As far as is known, 60 workers have died and 100 have been injured. In reality, the number may be higher. The mine shaft is 280 meters deep, so the explosion immediately created a world of darkness, making rescue extremely difficult. (Havas, 28th)

### The Central Government Finds Ways to Help Unemployed People Who Passed the Examination

Those Who Cannot Return to Their Original Agencies Will Be Given Jobs at Discretion

(Chengdu Airmail) The Executive Yuan forwarded the instructions of the National Government, according to the report of the Ministry of Personnel, the Examination Yuan, and the Ministry of Personnel, the people who passed the higher and ordinary examinations of the central and local governments in the past were evacuated by various agencies during the national period, or were unemployed due to the fall of the inland areas. The Ministry had previously drafted four relief measures and submitted them to the Ministry of Finance, which were forwarded to the National Government for approval and implementation. Article 3 of the original measures stipulates that if the original service agency has been lost in the occupied area, or the person is scattered in various places, and cannot return to the original agency for work due to traffic congestion, the Ministry will consider each member's wishes and submit a request to reassign him to the agency in the place where he is located or nearby, and give him a job at its discretion. In recent years, there have been quite a few people who have come to Sichuan and cannot return to their original agencies for work for a while. It seems that it is not enough to promote relief because the surrounding provinces can hardly accommodate as much as possible. Now, according to the Central Agency, it can also be assigned at its discretion, so as to adjust the situation, and it is also planned to supplement the regulations for filling in the application form and photos. The third item of the photo measures is slightly revised, and the remaining items will still be handled as before.

(B) When the income of the originally designated education funds and properties increases due to consolidation, the increased portion should still be fully allocated to education and cultural expenses. (C) The balance of education funds from the previous year should be fully used for expanding education business in the current year and should not be mixed into other expenses and arbitrarily allocated for purposes. (D) In addition to the first three items, the funds required to increase the salaries of primary school teachers may also be raised separately in accordance with the provisions of Item 2, and should not affect the original or new education business funds. 2. If the original funds are insufficient due to the promotion of education business in each county, they should actively raise funds in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of the first step implementation measures for consolidating education funds in each county decided by the 342nd Committee Meeting of the Provincial Government. 3. They should be consolidated and handled by the Financial Consolidation Committee of Shaanxi County in accordance with the consolidation measures stipulated by the Provincial Government. 4. Each county must implement special account management for education funds. Each county magistrate should submit a report on the handling of this article to the Provincial Government for record by the end of January. 5. The education funds of each county should be spent by the responsible section of the county government in accordance with the approved budget, and the monthly allocation should be submitted to the county magistrate for approval and the payment order should be filled out before the 15th of each month to notify the disbursement agency to issue the funds. If the income is insufficient, the county government should find ways to raise funds and should not delay payment. 6. Each county should select local fair gentry and education representatives to openly handle the sale of school grains, and should fairly negotiate prices at the current market value. Personnel from the Finance Committee and personnel related to education should not purchase them to prevent abuses. In addition to the separate orders, the combined orders are for compliance and conscientious handling. This order.

### Labor Unrest Intensifies, Public Buses Stop Running Yesterday, Italian Soldiers Fire Tear Gas, Many Injured, Company Strictly Refuses Demands

More than 2,000 coppersmiths, drivers, and ticket sellers of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company demanded pre-war treatment. They went on strike yesterday morning, causing all public buses to stop running completely. The striking workers gathered in front of the factory gate to demand a reply from the manager. The Italian garrison dispatched Italian soldiers to the post for strict guard. The company did not accept the workers' demands after consideration. The Industrial Section of the Municipal Council tried to mediate. The details are recorded as follows.

Strike Implemented Due to Unmet Demands

The company's coppersmiths first made a request to the company the night before to restore pre-war (before August 13) treatment, which was not approved by the authorities. The night shift coppersmiths first went on strike, and the day shift coppersmiths also stayed in the factory and did not leave all night. As for the drivers and ticket sellers, when they went to work in the factory yesterday morning, they continued the coppersmiths' demands and went on strike together. All the striking workers gathered at the company's factory gate square at 1171 Kang Nao Tu Road, and pushed six worker representatives to stand in the snow to demand a firm reply from the company.

All Buses on All Routes Stopped

All public buses on all routes were stopped from leaving the factory yesterday morning, resulting in a complete temporary suspension of service, including: Route 1 from Zhaofeng Park to Beijing Road Bund, Route 2 from Anhe Temple Road to Sichuan Road Bridge, Route 5 from Sanmaoge Bridge to Bazilu, Route 7 from Nanyang University to Caojiadu, Route 9 from Zhaofeng Park to Beijing Road Bund, Route 10 from Caojiadu to the Bund, Route 12 from Xiafei Road to Municipal Ferry Bund, Route 14 from Daxi Road and Dunxin Road to Nanjing Road Bund, Route 15 from Fuxu Road Tongfu Road to the Bund, Route 17 from Jing'an Temple to Robert Sun Road Intersection.

Italian Soldiers and Detectives Went to Guard

Kang Nao Tu Road is an Italian military defense zone. After receiving the report, Italian soldiers were dispatched to the front of the public bus company to guard closely. At the same time, the local police station also sent a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to maintain order and persuade the striking workers gathered at the company's gate to leave. As for the striking workers, in this extraordinary period, they strictly maintained order and had no outrageous actions. It is said that Italian soldiers have been stationed at the factory gate to prohibit anyone from entering or leaving (company employees are not subject to this rule).

Demands to Restore Pre-War Treatment

According to the striking workers yesterday, after the August 13 Shanghai War broke out, the company reduced workers' treatment from January 1938 due to sluggish business. Until June of last year, workers asked the company authorities to improve treatment due to soaring prices and difficult living conditions. The company agreed to add a 10% allowance. Until December of last year, due to the continued surge in prices, the workers made a second request. The company only agreed to issue a meal allowance of 15 cents per person per day, which was implemented in January of this year, but at this time, this amount was really of no help, so there was this third request to improve treatment. The workers decided that the requirements were the original methods before August 13, hoping that the authorities could understand the difficulties and accept them.

The Company Did Not Agree

The company manager met with the heads of the vehicle and machine departments in the company at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss the terms of the workers' demands. He believed that the points of the workers' request for a salary increase could not be accepted, so he rejected the workers' demands yesterday.

Italian Soldiers Interfere and Workers are Injured

As a result, the two sides were deadlocked. Until about 2:00 PM yesterday, a satisfactory solution had not yet been reached. Unexpectedly, Italian soldiers saw that more and more workers were gathering, so they fired tear gas. The workers fled, and the order was disrupted. The strike wave has worsened. There were a total of thirteen people injured on the spot.

### Coal Briquettes Sold at a Low Price Starting Tomorrow, Totaling 20,000 Loads, Low-Price Locations Total 26, Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Others Announce Clearance of Stack Goods, Small Coal Briquette Factories' Raw Materials Are on the Verge of Exhaustion

In order to actively promote the low-price sale of coal briquettes, the Shanghai Low-Price Coal Briquette Committee held its first committee meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday at Room 304, 3rd Floor, Hong Kong Road Banking Association. Chairman Xu Jilu decided: (1) to pass the twelve articles of the coal briquette low-price sale method; (2) the low-price sale will start on March 1st; (3) the low-price locations will total 26, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will send a letter to the two concessions authorities to send police to take care of and protect them.

Each Factory Distributes the Low-Price Quantity

A reporter from the New Sound News learned from the Shanghai Coal Briquette Industry Association yesterday that the association has already stipulated the quantity of coal briquettes sold at a low price by each factory: (A) Daily Sales Quantity: (1) Yi Taixing 480 loads, (2) Nanyang 200 loads, (3) Guohua 70 loads, (4) Dongfang 70 loads, (5) Jinghua 60 loads, (6) Guanghua 40 loads, (7) Huacheng Cuiji 20 loads, (8) Yuedong 20 loads, (9) Yuanhua 10 loads, (10) Heji 5 loads, (11) Nanfang Changji 10 loads, (12) Hu Licheng 5 loads, (13) Yanyan 5 loads, (14) Beiyang 5 loads, totaling 1,000 loads sold per day. (B) Total Recognized Quantity: (1) Yi Taixing 9,600 loads, (2) Nanyang 4,000 loads, (3) Guohua 1,400 loads, (4) Dongfang 1,400 loads, (5) Jinghua 1,200 loads, (6) Guanghua 800 loads, (7) Huacheng Cuiji 400 loads, (8) Yuedong 400 loads, (9) Yuanhua 200 loads, (10) Heji 100 loads, (11) Nanfang Changji 200 loads, (12) Hu Licheng 100 loads, (13) Yanyan 100 loads, (14) Beiyang 100 loads, totaling 20,000 loads recognized and distributed by each factory.

Jointly Issued Notice to Clear Stacked Goods

Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Coal Industry Association, Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association, and Shanghai Firewood and Charcoal Industry Association jointly issued a notice yesterday, saying, "The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association previously jointly issued a notice to stabilize the price of coal briquettes, stipulating that the wholesale price of coal briquettes should be 110 yuan per metric ton, and the door-to-door price should be 5 yuan and 8 jiao per hundred market catties, with an additional 2 jiao for delivery. The coal briquette stack tickets are limited to be cleared before February 29th. Because most of the coal briquette stack tickets have been recovered as scheduled, and a portion of the stack tickets has not been cleared due to the factory's simultaneous handling of door-to-door sales or the difficulty of transporting goods, the groups jointly decided on February 28th that all stack tickets that have not yet been shipped will be extended for 15 days starting from March 1st and must be cleared before March 15th. No new stack tickets will be issued, and the Coal Briquette Industry Association has resolved to implement this. All factories should strictly comply. Also, the price of coal briquettes will still be sold at the previously set amount. All Gu Coal Briquette Factories and coal, firewood, and charcoal stores in the city should abide by this and not exceed it. This is what we hope. Special announcement." It is reported that the stack rent will only be charged until February 29th during the extended delivery period for stack tickets, and rent will be waived from March 1st.

Appeal of Small Coal Briquette Factories

The soaring price of coal briquettes this time has caused the common people to face the danger of running out of food, but the most deeply affected and neglected are our ten or so small coal briquette factories. Because small coal briquette factories are limited by capital and cannot transport directly from the mine, they are everywhere subject to the control of others. Even this time, large capitalists stirred up trouble and raised the price of coal briquettes and coal chips by thirty-three days, claiming that the water freight had risen to 28 shillings. In fact, coal with 28 shillings of water freight has not yet been loaded to Shanghai. The six major coal merchants have piles of coal chips like mountains, totaling no less than 30,000 tons, all of which were imported at cheap water freight. Now they are either hoarding coal chips and not selling them, or raising the price to more than 110 yuan per ton, or claiming that "self-transportation and self-production are not enough to distribute to small factories" (see the letter from the association to the three companies). The market has become tense, and they are also monopolizing raw materials, so that small factories cannot work hard even if they want to supply the market. Recently, Tongcheng Company automatically allocated 200 tons of coal chips and distributed them to various small factories at a flat price of 90 yuan per ton, which is also commendable even though it is a drop in the bucket. We sincerely hope that the major coal merchants will not give in, and at the same time hope that the authorities of the two concessions will pay close attention and come to the rescue. The small-scale coal briquette factories will stop one after another within a week due to the exhaustion of raw materials. At that time, not only will the supply of coal briquettes in the market be reduced, but also a group of unemployed workers will be added.

### Even if the Municipal Council Can Increase Donations, It Should Still Strive to Economize, 69% of Municipal Revenue is Spent on Salaries, Foreign Exchange Allowances, etc., Major Cities Do Not Have This Type of Distribution Method

The Mainland News editorial on the 29th stated that what must be stated again is that the Mainland News is not obstructing the Municipal Council's proposed donation increase. The shortsighted and wasteful policies of the council in the past have made increasing donations at this time the only remedy to save financial life. Therefore, increasing donations by 15% has no other way, no matter what impact it has on the residents of the Public Concession economically, except to

Implement this proposal

The editorial of the Daily News has no objection to the urgent need for increased donations at this time. We understand its urgency and are prepared to firmly protect it. However, the point that we have repeatedly emphasized is that the Municipal Council urgently needs to adopt a more prudent and economical policy. We believe that there is no need to regret it, but if the Municipal Council is to be saved, then the taxpayers here must not allow it to repeat the

Regretful

Mistake. The Municipal Council spends too much on staff salaries, pensions, and other temporary expenses, which is our main concern and is also of concern to other residents of the Public Concession. The Daily News editorial on Tuesday stated that out of the 25,908,680 yuan of revenue of the Municipal Council in 1939, no less than 18,000,000 yuan was spent on salaries, pensions, foreign exchange, and travel allowances. Therefore, supporting Municipal Council employees accounted for 69% of municipal revenue.

Cities All Over the World

No matter how large or well-managed they are, they rarely spend 69% of their income on salaries, pensions, and allowances like the Municipal Council. To confirm this statement, we telegraphed Tokyo and Manila to request the budget figures of the two cities. The replies are as follows. Manila City Finance Officer Alfonso telegraphed that Manila's revenue in 1938 totaled 10,153,675.22 pesos, of which 3,271,38.99 pesos were

Spent on Teachers

Police officers and firefighters' salaries, other salaries and allowances for municipal staff, reached 707,340.07 pesos. Staff salaries, personnel expenses, and allowances totaled 2,978,723.06 pesos, accounting for about 14% of total revenue. According to news from Tokyo, the revenue of the Tokyo Municipal Government in 1937 totaled 125,701,000 Japanese yen, of which only 10.5% was used for salaries, administration, and

Personnel Expenses

Totaling 22,197,000 yuan. This data from Manila and Tokyo makes us believe that the Municipal Council's spending 69% of its revenue on salaries, pensions, and allowances is rare, and other cities spend less. From this point of view, the Municipal Council's financial reform must start from this point.

### French Concession Goods Evaluation Committee Held its First Meeting Yesterday; Public Concession Also Organizes Subcommittee to Study Measures and Efficiency of Price Control

### The Function of Cosmic Rays: Aiding Human Evolution; They Are Shot from All Parts of the Sky to the Ground; American Scientists Go to India to Collect Materials; After Completion, They Pass Through Shanghai to Discuss the Principles of Cosmic Rays

The Continental News reports that Dr. Millikan, President of the California Institute of Technology in the United States, is a world-renowned scientist. Recently, with funding from the Carnegie Institution of New York, he, along with Dr. Neher and Dr. Picard, went to India to collect materials on cosmic rays. After three months, they are now

on their way back to America

and arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 28th). According to their discussion, if more is known about cosmic rays, the entire state of human life may change greatly. They obtained excellent materials from their trip to India, which enabled people to further understand the nature of science. According to one theory, cosmic rays have a great influence on human changes and evolution. To put it simply, if humans

originated from apes,

then cosmic rays have contributed to this evolution. If so, what will become of humans in the future? A part of it may be determined by cosmic rays. This is one of the most significant discoveries of this century. The increase in human knowledge of cosmic rays has a greater impact on human life than any previous invention. If it were not for Newton, Galileo and others

studying astronomy,

then the principles used to evolve ancient cultures into modern civilization might never have been . Discovered in 1910, when in India, he put recording instruments in balloons and lifted them to the top of the atmosphere for detection. These experiments must be conducted in the equatorial zone, which is why he went to India. Cosmic rays are shot

from all parts of the sky to the ground

with electrons, and their energy is very large, but they are blocked by magnetic fields. He measured the total energy of cosmic rays shot to the ground in Ugla, India, at magnetic latitude seven degrees, and from the difference between the total energy measured in the two places, he can accurately know the number of electrons, thereby laying the foundation for a better understanding of the origin and nature of cosmic rays. His purpose in going to India was for this.

The police immediately opened the bag for inspection and were shocked to find the body of an unidentified man who had been shot to death. The man appeared to be about fifty years old, wearing a wool shirt and trousers, gray suit trousers, silk stockings, and black leather shoes. The bullet entered the right side of the head behind the ear and pierced the left cheek. The body was still warm, indicating that he had just been killed, placed in the bag, and carried to the spot to be abandoned. There were no other documents on his person to prove who the deceased was. The situation seemed to be a case of murder. They immediately reported to the French police station, which sent investigators to investigate. Then the body was sent to the Tairasite Road small hospital for an autopsy. At noon yesterday, a report was made to the Second Special Court, which appointed a prosecutor to come to the hospital to verify that the unidentified man had died from a gunshot wound.

B. Regular Expenditure Items: The draft regular expenditure totaled 1,591,527 yuan. Due to the improvement of the treatment of Chinese police officers, the results of the re-correction were re-added by 140,830 yuan. The Director of Finance then consulted with the Director of Police to re-examine the efforts to reduce under the principle of savings, so this budget will still have room for adjustment in the future. The draft, the amendment, and the previous year's budget are listed for comparison below.

In addition, "Under the "Ordinary Category", the rent and allowance for foreign staff residences are listed as 506,260 yuan.

The reason for the increase in "Salaries and Allowances" is due to the issuance of temporary living allowances, the increase in the salaries of officials, the increase in rent allowances, the improvement of the treatment of Japanese groups, and the advance increase in the salary of Chinese police officers by one year. The reason for the decrease in "Travel Expenses" is due to the suspension of long vacations for Western staff this year. As for the increase in other items, it is nothing more than the high prices of goods and utilities.

Prison expenses are 1,007,690 yuan more than last year, due to the sharp increase in new salaries and allowances for clothing and equipment, and prisoner expenses.

The various "ordinary" expenses are as follows: (1) Purchase of three large cars for 40,940 yuan; (2) Purchase of four machine bicycles for 30.800 yuan; (3) Woodware and spare parts for 29.130 yuan.

(2) The allowance paid by the consulate for foreign prisoners held in the prison is planned to be increased, and it is expected to increase revenue by 24.480 yuan this year. Based on the above corrections, the final amendment to the regular expenses (temporary) can be obtained as follows.

Regarding the expenses of the prison section, due to the sharp increase in prisoners in the prison, the expenses are huge and it is not convenient to review and reduce them. The above items have been approved by the Provisional Budget Garrison Committee at a meeting on the 2nd of this month. Except that it is necessary for the Director of Finance and the Director of Police to jointly manage the adjustment, it is allowed to submit it to the Finance Committee for review.

### He Xitang Sells Iron Materials; Manager Conspires to Kidnap; He Goes Back on His Word and Does Not Distribute Profits; Lu Renchang Conspires with Fake Officials to Kidnap; Five Key Criminals Arrested and Detained for Interrogation

Yuanfeng Hardware Store, No. 5, North Shanxi Middle Road, was opened by He Xitang, a Wuxi native, and has been in operation for many years. His partner in the store, Lu Renchang, a Wuxi native, is usually very diligent in his work, so six years ago, He gave Lu the position of manager, and Lu was fully responsible for all affairs in the store. However, on January 29 of this year, He was suddenly kidnapped by a number of kidnappers in the store. At the time when the bandits kidnapped He, they were riding in car number 17854.

this clue. Later, the car was found at the entrance of Lane 318, Tiantong Road. The police then joined forces with the Japanese military authorities to search the lane house by house.

   English and American Exchange Buying Activity Increases; Large Amounts of Foreign Rice Settlements for Days; Foreign Exchange Market Inevitably Affected

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The black market conditions for English and American exchanges were generally soft. This was mainly due to the robust sales of foreign rice in recent days, leading to numerous settlements. Additionally, speculative traders were actively involved, resulting in strong buying interest. Foreign banks such as American Express and Chase National Bank also absorbed a large volume. Although HSBC released first telegraphic transfers at 4 pence 1/25, the amount reached a substantial 100,000+ pounds. Furthermore, due to tight monetary conditions, money changers released US dollar drafts in the morning, also in large quantities, but these were all absorbed, ultimately leading to a tightening to 0.15625 and 0.0625. The dollar was tighter than the pound due to the shrinking US-UK exchange rates overseas. The morning opening for buying and selling was generally flat, remaining at 4 pence 1/40625 and 6.825 yuan. Subsequently, foreign banks like American Express and China & South Sea Bank initiated buying sprees. Foreign firms also actively settled for March-April terms. Coupled with speculative traders piling in, and a certain bank initially offering, then abruptly turning to frantic absorption, despite the releases from money changers and HSBC, the supply still felt inadequate, causing the market trend to shift during the day. However, by the afternoon closing, it had narrowed to 4 pence 2/15 and 6.75 yuan. Fortunately, HSBC continued to support in the afternoon, stabilizing the trend. However, once HSBC ceased buying, the exchange rate briefly jumped to 4 pence 1/9075 and 6.071875 yuan. Although Chinese merchants and oil firms still had buying appetite afterward, HSBC resumed supply, and other foreign banks were also slightly more willing to release, so by the evening closing, the English and American exchange rates remained similar to the afternoon closing. Due to more activity in futures, they were slightly separated from the spot market.

Later, because HSBC stopped selling, and speculative traders continued to be active, the exchange rate once shouted tight past 4 pence 1.09375 and 6.71875 yuan. At that time, March US exchange at 6.65625 yuan was difficult to settle.

### Bull Market Activities Major; Gold Prices Rising Again; Ultimately, Tight Monetary Conditions Make It Difficult for Bulls to Get Their Wish; Calculated in US Dollars, Still More Than 300 Yuan Lower

Yesterday's spot cash gold black market situation, following the tightening of foreign exchange, saw a resurgence of rising prices. Furthermore, the Hong Kong gang's activities were quite intense, and a certain bank constantly absorbed. Also, a certain securities gang and a certain gold firm first sold and then suddenly bought back in, so the result was a squeeze up 74 yuan. However, due to extremely tight monetary conditions, high posting water, and the difficulty of obtaining banknotes, it is not surprising that bulls are unable to get their wish, and we will see a skyrocketing of 100+ yuan. Moreover, based on the US dollar exchange rate calculation, gold prices were again pressed down by 330-340 yuan. The morning opening was still flat, with the price at 4,790 yuan. Subsequently, due to a certain gold firm abandoning their position, it once fell back a small 2 yuan, retreating to a low price of 4,788 yuan.

Then, a certain gold firm released 20 taels to the same industry, at 4,788 yuan. After a short while, the foreign exchange market was soft, and securities gangs were the first to drag in. Coupled with certain banks and money industries also buying and selling each other, it rose 39 yuan. Money changers entered a gold firm for 50 taels, at 4,827 yuan. Afterwards, a certain securities gang suddenly came to release, and money changers and silversmith gangs also threw out, while the buying party had less appetite, so it fell back a small 17 yuan. Securities gangs sold 30 taels to money changers, at 4,810 yuan. Around 10:45, the exchange market continued to report slightly tighter, and with the Hong Kong gang suddenly becoming active, a certain bank and a certain money changer also came back to search and buy, rising again 22 yuan. Money changers entered securities gangs for 50 taels, at 4,832 yuan. At that time, retail investors saw the Hong Kong gang stop entering, and immediately came to release at a high price, so it fell back a small 12 yuan. The silversmith gang released 10 taels to money changers, at 4,820 yuan. At noon, a certain money changer reinvigorated the buying wind, and a certain bank continued to absorb, so it was pulled up again 16 yuan. A certain bank entered the silversmith gang for 10 taels, at 4,836 yuan. The silversmith gang then released 30 taels to securities firms, at 4,835 yuan, as the noon closing price. The afternoon market was even tighter, opening rose 15 yuan. Silversmith gangs did 30 taels with each other, at 4,850 yuan. After a while, it fell back slightly 5 yuan. The silversmith industry sold 10 taels to gold firms, at 4,845 yuan. Afterwards, as foreign exchange continued to tighten, a certain gold firm and securities gang competed to buy, and another gold firm and a certain silversmith also searched in place of the Hong Kong gang, so it rose 25 yuan. Money changers released 10 taels to securities gangs, at 4,870 yuan. After entering, money changers and a certain bank suddenly came to release, but buyers had turned less, falling back 15 yuan.

### Grain
   Foreign Rice Fluctuations Are Enormous; It Can Be Seen That It Is a Speculative Market

The rice market, which has been falling for the past week, is currently moving with solid demand, with a turnaround seen in seconds. Yesterday, the local shops' outlets were quite lively, while merchants and general speculative traders held large quantities of rice grain in their hands, not only were they willing to throw out rice, but they also pulled it in single-mindedly. Under this situation, the market trended upwards again, so at the initial opening, Saigon No. 1 rose 1 yuan, selling at 46.5 yuan. Afterwards, it continued to rise step by step, reaching 47 yuan. Huojiao initially was 45 yuan, then shouted up to 46 yuan, more sought after than Saigon, calculated at about 2 yuan. However, because it was too high, after the special purchase of the Pagoda brand at 45.8 yuan for one or two bars, the actual sale price of all other brands was only 45.5 yuan. The situation for other goods was similar. Only Tokyo polished rice, although its outlets were not extensive, its market also brought up with the other goods, but the number was only half a yuan or so, especially sold at 42.5 yuan to 41.5 yuan. From morning to noon, the rice market saw changes, regardless of wholesale customer appetite. The overall situation immediately turned to hover. Momentarily, general floating hoarders saw solid demand and suddenly their thoughts became sluggish. The market color swayed as if there was a pullback trend, and suddenly they threw out all the goods in their hands, causing the returning goods to be abundant at once, immediately showing an oversupply, and the upward market trend saw defeat and turned downstream. Moving to noon, its closing market, if Saigon No. 1 had already depreciated by half a yuan compared to the morning market, to 46 yuan. Huojiao, because the booming trend was already fierce, the return trend was not fierce, and it had already reached 44.5 yuan, a reduction of 1 yuan compared to the morning price, with a mere increase of half a yuan compared to the previous market. As for Saigon No. 2, Siamese pointed small grain mixed broken, etc., all rose high, and all fell low. Although market prices had discrepancies, the environment was indeed consistent. The glutinous rice sales market, yesterday, was not able to be called smooth, so those who opened had few national goods, and the market color was slightly beautiful by half a yuan. Thick and thin Japonica rice and early and late inland sources of rice, due to rain and snow working together, had not turned out, and in the field black market, it was heard that foreign rice trended upwards, and good yuan grade, Pu tip, which had been cold for a long time, had a black market that had opened at 47 yuan, it is said.

However, the returning goods have already loosened secretly, although the fall is limited, if compared with the highest special, the difference is quite substantial, because at present, there are few sources of supply for stack order flour, and the local customer sales are also very bland.

Speculators are concentrated in these two markets, and the public debt situation is even more depressed. Although the same industry still slightly embellishes it, most large firms have already satisfied themselves. In the morning, Taifeng had slight buying, and Dingkang sold out. In the afternoon, Zhong Shenkang had slight buying, and Dachong sold out. That was all. As a result, except for the under kind which did not open, all other returns were small 1-1.5 dimes.

The yarn market continues to rise, since the rising wind is raging, this is because the foreign exchange has seen a slight contraction, the speculative mood of general non-professionals is extremely strong, and the buying wind is becoming more and more dramatic, so the horizontal surface is tight, and the buying households see one after another coming, so the market disc has risen sharply.

### Yarn Market Fiercely腾, Cotton Prices Rise Even Faster

The spot cotton trade saw another improvement, but the factory needs are still lacking, and the peer-to-peer buying and selling is secretive in its development.

### Letter

Sir,
I recently read in your newspaper on February 27 a news item about "Cooked Coal Also Has a Monopoly," which is clearly inconsistent with the facts. According to our firm, since we have been the sole agent for Silaihuo cooked coal, the supply to all sectors has never been interrupted. Now, because the firm's output is decreasing day by day, the daily output supplied to various public groups and contract users is still not enough to meet the needs. We are very sorry for the burden. Currently, our firm is working hard to ensure that when the firm's output is large, it will definitely provide customers with a source of energy. The words "large accumulation for hoarding and monopoly" are likely a misrepresentation of the facts. We hope that you will correct them as soon as possible to correct the public's views.

Sincerely,
Shanghai Cooked Coal Firm
To: Economic News Department, Shen Bao

### Please Pay Attention to Counterfeit Stamps

— Editor

Reply to Mr. Ding Juerong and a Reader

To Mr. Ding Juerong and a Reader: Your letter and the attached revenue stamps have been received. After careful examination, the two types of stamps are indeed quite different. We specifically took them to the Chamber of Commerce for inquiry. The Chamber of Commerce office confirmed that one of them is indeed counterfeit. However, after printing, the details are blurry and unclear, making it difficult to distinguish between genuine and fake. Therefore, we are detailing the differences below:

(1) The format of the genuine stamp is larger.

(2) The pagoda image in the counterfeit stamp is blurry and unclear.

(3) The genuine stamp is dark green, while the counterfeit stamp is grass green.

(4) The genuine stamp has hard-pressed imprints on the back, while the counterfeit one does not.

(5) The paper of the counterfeit stamp is thinner.

Furthermore, the Chamber of Commerce has entrusted us to inform all businesses that if they wish to purchase stamps, please purchase them directly from the various trade associations. If there are hawkers selling them on the streets, please be sure to distinguish between genuine and fake. If anyone is found selling counterfeit stamps, immediately hand them over to the authorities for strict punishment.

### "Private Viewing" of Domestic Rice

— Yu Xiangyun

In Shanghai, it seems that only large pharmacies "privately view" ginseng and bird's nest, jewelry stores "privately view" precious jewelry, and diamond shops "privately view" diamonds when it comes to cautious transactions where shop owners lead customers inside to "privately view" goods. Apart from these, I haven't heard of other stores taking customers inside to "privately view" goods.

However, now, rice shops have also started this trick. Yesterday, when I poked my head through the window to ask the shop assistant about rice prices, they readily replied, "Top-grade foreign Xian rice is fifty-two, second-grade is forty-eight." I then explained to them that I didn't need foreign Xian rice; I wanted to buy domestic rice and asked them to show me the appearance of the domestic rice.

A shop assistant, smiling, nodded repeatedly and said, "Yes, yes, yes! Please come in, the domestic rice is inside." Then, he instructed an apprentice to open a section of the securely closed shop door and let me in.

I entered, and he politely led me through an iron gate into a room that resembled both an accounting office and a bedroom. He turned on the electric light and then brought out many samples of domestic rice, placing them on the iron square table. He pointed with his finger, grinning, and said, "This one is forty-eight, this one is fifty-two, this one is fifty-six..." After stating the prices, he paused and added, "There isn't much of this fifty-six yuan kind, you can only buy it by the dan (a unit of weight)."

I stared at the rice samples, my heart pounding like wild horses galloping. Nearly sixty yuan for a dan of rice, this squeeze on life will truly turn people into starving corpses.

At that time, I chose the forty-eight yuan one and bought two dan. I paid him the money and then wrote down an address, instructing him to issue an invoice and deliver it.

But, unexpectedly, not only did they refuse to issue an invoice, they also refused to deliver. I then argued on principle, questioning their reasons, but they just smiled and said, "You're a knowledgeable person, you're quite familiar with the situation in the market, we also have our difficulties." It was then that I guessed the reason they refused to issue an invoice: to avoid legal responsibility, preventing outsiders from providing evidence of their violation of price limits. It can truly be said to be extremely clever!

Lessons from Gambling

### Everyone Lost

— Peng

At the end of last year, colleagues in the office proposed renting a company room, saying that everyone could bring their families to take baths, and have a place to play during the Spring Festival holiday. After two years of hard work, it was a rare opportunity, so naturally everyone was willing to participate. After the office reopened on the third day of the new year, the room could have been returned. However, the "lucky money" won from mahjong in those few days was enough to cover the room rental for several more days; no one suggested it, and everyone "understood" to continue renting the room. As soon as the office closed, everyone crowded together again, some playing cards, some dancing, and the daily "lucky money" was enough to rent the room long-term. This continued until the Lantern Festival, when the number of people in the room gradually decreased. This wasn't because "the fun had run out," but because several colleagues had lost too much money. As a result, the card players struggled to find "partners," and the dancers had no "companions." In such a situation, naturally no one needed to suggest returning the room.

After reflecting on the pain, when it was first proposed, everyone contributed five yuan. At the end of the accounting, there was even a surplus of three jiao and a few fen of "lucky money" left over. It seemed like each person only spent a little over four yuan for those twenty days, which seemed like a good deal. However, the daily room rent, meals, cigarettes, etc., cost at least twenty yuan, wasn't it all coming out of everyone's pockets? Except it wasn't directly paid, but indirectly through the mahjong games.

The lesson of "everyone lost" made us realize: if we had to raise such a large sum of money in advance to rent a room for twenty days, there would definitely be opposition. But now, because the mahjong "lucky money" was the middleman, we unknowingly spent so much money. This shows how harmful gambling is!

If we go further, besides the room rent being obtained by a third party, the rest was shared and enjoyed by everyone. However, those gambling dens have to pay a million yuan in "protection fees" every month, as well as even greater expenses. So, is there any hope for those who gamble to win money?

Therefore, I am writing down our lesson of "everyone lost," hoping that those who harbor a "chance-taking mentality" will take it as a serious warning.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 21: Managing Finances by Mixing Fabric Quality, Building Machinery to Assist with Literary Achievements

Three years ago, Jiang Jingrong also went to Europe and America to inspect silk fabrics. He felt that among the European countries, France and Italy were the most particular about silk fabrics. The other countries were a bit lacking. Because France and Italy both produce silk, and their industries are also highly developed. He also felt that Chinese silk fabrics were very easy and smooth to sell abroad. However, first, silk fabric merchants must broaden their horizons. In the past, our country's silk fabric merchants only sought the domestic market, not the foreign market. For example, when a new silk fabric is produced, as long as it suits the preferences of domestic gentlemen and ladies, the quality, color, and pattern must be carefully considered so that everyone likes to use it, and that kind of material can be sold well. Now that we want to sell it abroad, we must explore the preferences of foreign gentlemen and ladies. Jiang Jingrong also saw Chinese silks and satins displayed in department stores in Europe and America. But he felt that there were still few, and they could not compete with the products of France and Italy. Moreover, they were only the fabrics that can be commonly seen in the country, not the products specially made for European and American gentlemen and ladies. Jiang Jingrong also meant that he did not refuse the sale of European and American silk fabrics to China, and he was also willing to sell Chinese silk fabrics to European and American countries. In European and American countries, men's clothes are mostly made of wool fabrics, and women's clothes are mostly made of silk fabrics, especially in the spring and summer. He and the father of the two Miss He were old friends. He went to Beiping for the distribution of a silk shop and also for a woolen fabric factory in Beiping, and he was busy for more than a month. Because he talked about silk fabrics with Mr. He, and he also knew that the two Miss He had returned from studying textile majors in the United States, everyone talked happily, so they organized this silk weaving factory. According to Jiang Jingrong's idea, it must be done on a large scale, and the funds must be more than 10 million yuan. He said: We are not doing business with the Chinese, we are determined to do business with foreigners. Producing such expensive silk fabrics in China seems to be guiding the Chinese people to extravagance. In the emerging China, we must strive for frugality. In European and American countries, they can afford it after all, and they don't care. Moreover, Chinese wages are cheaper than foreign wages. The cost of the same thing produced in China can be at least one-third cheaper. Therefore, he said: In foreign trade, as long as the products are excellent and cater to the preferences of Europeans and Americans, we are not afraid that the sales will not develop. Now that the two Miss He are organizing this silk weaving factory, they also intend to promote Chinese silk fabrics to foreign countries, and this purpose coincides. (244)

### Attention Should Also Be Paid to Buying Coal Balls

— Jin Rong

Editor: After seeing Mr. Cheng's article "Attention to Families Stealing Rice" in your publication, I thought that in today's world of "rice like pearls and firewood like cinnamon," attention should also be paid to buying coal balls.

A week ago, just when coal balls were soaring to six yuan and eight jiao per dan, my family happened to run out of coal balls. I then called for a dan of coal balls from a nearby coal shop. When they were delivered, I borrowed a scale and weighed them with the delivery person. Although there was no cheating with the scale bar, the result was still short in weight. One basket was forty-seven jin, and the other was forty-six jin, totaling only ninety-three jin. After deducting the weight of the two baskets, the actual weight was less than ninety jin, which was a difference of ten jin from the standard one hundred jin per dan, equivalent to about seven jiao. When I argued with them, they said, "The coal balls were weighed by the boss, I don't know anything." Shanghai families who use coal balls have never paid attention to the weight, and they take advantage of this to use their tricks. Usually, when the price is low, there is no need to be too concerned about this, but in today's world of soaring prices, we must take it seriously. On the one hand, we can stop their deceptive methods, and on the other hand, we can also reduce our financial losses, especially for economic families like ours, who can't bear such unexpected exploitation.

I think this shortage of weight is not limited to rice and coal balls. Other items may also have this situation. I hope that their dark secrets can be exposed at any time.

### Hollywood Actresses Choose Their Ideal Man

— Xin Ying

First, Have Courage; Second, Have Money

In the eyes of Hollywood actresses, what kind of man do they love the most? This question is often asked, but it is difficult to get an answer. However, recently, the actresses in Warner Bros. Pictures had the opportunity to find an answer. A total of eighteen actresses participated, who could answer the questions freely. Only one of them was a young and beautiful girl, and all the other participants have had considerable success on the screen and are quite happy in their families. Here is a brief description of how they chose their favorite man.

List of Participating Actresses

The actresses who participated in the selection this time include Salome, Pamela, Lucile Mayline, Ann Sheridan, Sally Wheat, Joan Blair, Gin Hammerman, Violet Marschall, Ellis, Ganell Punch, Marys Lichsen, Margot Stevenson, Rosale Dunn, Nancy Van Brevet, Mary Ann Dean, Gin Ganelbert, Rosale Van Punk, Macy Robertson, etc. The last one is a 75-year-old stage star and movie star.

Seven Types of Men

Bette Davis was unable to participate because she was taking a long vacation in New England after filming a movie. Cary Grant also did not participate, because he was vacationing in Ireland. For convenience, each participating actress was given a form listing seven types of men: (1) a man with courage and leadership who can be a master, (2) a wealthy man, (3) a very handsome man, (4) a man who is good at humor, (5) a man who is knowledgeable, (6) a man who is cautious, (7) a man who is passionate.

Everyone Loves Courage

The results of the selection put the man with courage first, indicating that he is the most loved. Ten out of the eighteen people ranked him first, and five people ranked him second. No one ranked the handsome man first, and only three people ranked him second. But two people ranked the passionate man first, and four people ranked him second. Three of the youngest actresses ranked the wealthy man first, and two others ranked the wealthy man second. Five people ranked the man who is good at humor second. The knowledgeable man is truly somewhat pitiful compared to the courageous man. Only two people chose him first, and two people chose him second. Not a single vote was cast for the cautious man.

Why Still Need Money

Therefore, after such a selection, a certainty was obtained. Hollywood actresses hope that men first have courage and second have money. Perhaps some lovers will be surprised that actresses can earn a lot of money themselves, so why do they still want men to have money?

### Small Suggestions for Filming "Dream of the Red Chamber"

— Movie Fan

I am very excited about the news of Xin Tie filming the entire "Dream of the Red Chamber" movie, which was previously published by Mr. Bingbing in this column. "Dream of the Red Chamber" is a famous novel in our country's old novels. It can be said that everyone knows it. If it is used to make a movie, its power to attract audiences is of course very great; but the characters in it are numerous, and each character has its own personality, so it is really not easy to select many actors who can suit the characters in the play. Seeing that the decision is to spend 100,000 yuan to build the Daguan Garden scene in the Lilac Garden, it can be imagined how much the company attaches importance to the film. I don't know what the structure of this film is, so let's not talk about it for the time being. What needs attention here is the issue of casting.

Then let me try to suggest it now. First of all, I think the most important thing to consider is the role of Jia Baoyu. If you let those popular male stars play the role of a young master who spends all day in the powder team, likes to eat lipstick on women's mouths, and has the demeanor of a girl, there will definitely be no good results, because they are not the kind of soft bones and will not make people feel pity; if they reluctantly describe Baoyu's appearance, what we will see will probably just be a creepy disgusting thing. May I ask, can they become a fifteen or sixteen-year-old playboy? I believe, who else can be competent for this role except Yuan Meiyun? We have seen a lot of her male costume dramas. If we close our eyes and think, we will feel that all her advantages are most appropriate to play Baoyu; moreover, this kind of gimmick is also the most liked by Shanghai people.

It seems good to have Gu Lanjun play Xue Baochai, and it seems more appropriate for Chen Yanyan to play Lin Daiyu, but she is a little fat. I don't know how Zhou Xuan is. Please give me some advice.

### Miscellaneous Notes on Shouyun Teapot Opera

— Lin Shaoqing

Listening to Huang Jin Er Jin Gong (Part 2)

Xi Chang's Yuanban "I am Like" uses Yan Jupeng's tune, which I don't think is right. One is that the tune is too fancy and there is no emotion to speak of; the other is that the board position is wrong, which is not as generous as the old tune. The good words of the old tune should be on the eyes. Below, Xi Chang does not have words such as spring, summer, autumn, winter, fishing, farming, reading, painting, etc. I say this is very good. The old words originally had these patterns, so you must use the old tune to sing them. At least you have to sing Wang Jiuling's tune to be good. Singing Tan's tune has no burden at all.

If you sing old words with a new tune, it is better not to sing them. Moreover, this singing is a memorial to the emperor, not telling a story to an old woman. Yi Xinpei's deletion is indeed insightful. Then, they sang Liu Kuai's Yuanban. Qiu Shengrong and Xi Xiaobo both rush to sing the last word, that is, the big face sings to the last word. The old Sheng doesn't wait for the last word of the big face to be sung before taking over, and the first word is sung on the board at the same time as the last word of the big face. The big face also takes over in the same way, which is called rushing the board. This kind of singing method is to show skill, but the last word of each sentence is bound to have the disadvantage of being difficult to hear clearly. Also, this kind of singing method makes the board slot too fast, and the Dan role also has the difficulty of not being able to catch up. The old role originally had a non-rushing board singing method here, which is better than this. I advocate that it is not appropriate to rush the board, so that all three people can sing more comfortably. According to the reason, this play should be sung comfortably, not cramped, so that people will not be nervous listening to it.

### An Interesting Statistic: Why Do You Watch Movies?

— Tina

Two years ago, an American magazine asked the question "Why do you watch movies?" and publicly solicited answers. As a result, it received more than 10,000 letters from readers, with a wide variety of strange answers. The magazine specially compiled the following statistics:

(Answer) (Percentage)

Because the protagonist is my beloved star 37.81%

Because the script is one I like or have read 27.58%

Went to see it after reading reviews or hearing good reviews 14.11%

To accompany my husband or wife to watch it together 11.43%

For the magnificent scenery in the film 10.02%

Just to pass the time 3.54%

Other 1.51%

### Miscellaneous Notes on "Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom"

— Gong Jiong

Although Li Xiucheng and other national heroes such as Hong Xiuquan rose up from Jintian Village together, his prudence, shrewdness, and intelligence were truly the first capable minister of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. If, in November of the thirteenth year of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, when Zeng Guofan's demon soldiers besieged Tianjing, the Heavenly King had listened to his "relocation" plan, who would have known how the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom would have developed?

The playwright unfolds the social phenomena of the time from such a meaningful character, which I think is quite ingenious, and to a certain extent, it can still give ordinary people a sense of alarm and lessons.

Li Xiucheng came from the ranks of ordinary people and personally experienced everything that ordinary people felt in that era; the unbearable ravages of the Tartars and the shamelessness of the traitorous Han made him realize and awaken that without resisting, without fighting, without removing the oppressors who were skinning and drinking blood on the backs of ordinary people, there was no way to live. Thus, in the bloody life, his true enthusiasm and determination to relieve the suffering of the people were nurtured.

Mr. Yang Hansheng seems to have grasped particularly tightly the promotion of this significance in "Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom."

In the second act, the emphasis on national resistance reached the highest level of that era. The concubine personally went to the battlefield to take care of and bandage the soldiers, and Grandma Liu encouraged her grandson to kill the Tartars and took care of him back and forth with her medicine box, which reminded me of Grandma Wang, the guerrilla mother who is active now.

The love and admiration of the common people for Prince Zhong can be said to have reached the point of madness. The precarious and turbulent Tianjing was as stable as Mount Tai when Prince Zhong returned. When Prince Zhong expressed his vow not to leave Tianjing until death, the enthusiastic cheering of the common people holding torches high was not like madness? When it was rumored that Prince Zhong had been martyred in Zeng's camp, hundreds of households of common people knelt together in front of the spirit tablet of Li Xiucheng and cried sadly, what kind of sincere and sublime emotion was that!

The characters arranged by the author in the play are saved to the point where they cannot be saved. Each character has a prominent personality and a close relationship with each other. Even the two supporting peasant families other than the main trunk of Li Xiucheng's family have different styles.

What I love most is that in this play, no matter the ups and downs of the situation or the unpredictability of the timing, it is always full of a magnificent atmosphere. This atmosphere is radiated from Li Xiucheng's personal body, shining on the common people, and is always actively advancing.

The Shanghai Drama Society is staging this play, hoping to bring this atmosphere to the ordinary people on the isolated island!
