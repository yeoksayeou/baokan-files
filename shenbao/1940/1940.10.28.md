### U.S. Striving to Defend the Continent, Continuing Aid to China and Britain

Hull Declares U.S. Already Facing Local War

Resolves to Use Fleet to Prevent Dictatorial Nations from Extending Hegemony

Washington – Secretary of State Hull stated here last night to national newspapers that the United States should continue to aid China and Britain. Hull said that anyone who believes that the United States does not need to aid China and Britain is essentially relinquishing their inherent right to self-defense. Hull also stated that U.S. aid to China and Britain in their war efforts is part of America's countless peace efforts. The Secretary of State also said that the United States needs peace, but the aggression of totalitarian nations has shown the United States that it can no longer naively rely on its own unreliable security, because the empty promises of dictators are equal to zero. Hull stated that, "We are already facing a local war. This local war is expanding its conquest through resolute and organized actions. If we want to stop dictators striving for power, we must make ourselves unassailable. There is no other way." Hull further warned Americans that victories by the Axis powers in Europe and Asia would force the inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere to wage a war of self-defense on their own soil to preserve their own lives. Hull also stated that the United States' peace program will be intensified from now on. He said, "We are now striving to seek, within the realm of possibility, the spirit of American loyalty and unity and a continental defense system. It would be a great fallacy to imagine that aggression may not befall us. Although the two oceans are vast, they cannot prevent the enemy's economic, political, and military attacks. The two oceans are merely an obstacle, but at times they can also serve as a highway to the enemy. Moreover, the obstruction of distance is merely a matter of time. Once the victors control other continents, their second step will be to concentrate their forces to gain dominance over the sea, air, and economy. If that happens, they can then use their naval and air power to invade the Western Hemisphere." Although Hull did not explicitly mention the names of China and Britain, he said that he believes the United States must continue to aid these countries. The so-called "these countries," I believe, refers to China and Britain without a doubt. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Washington – President Roosevelt, in a letter to Secretary of the Navy Knox on Navy Day, stated, in brief, that the American fleet is something that prevents dictatorial nations from extending their hegemony in the Western Hemisphere. I sincerely pray that the United States Navy will continue to use its strength to express our determination to always be a free people. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

U.S. Embarks on
Expanding Armor Plate

Washington – The U.S. Navy plans to embark on expanding the manufacturing of armor plate worth $80 million, because the lack of this raw material may temporarily hinder the Two-Ocean Policy. According to a secret report obtained by Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox, U.S. Navy officials plan to commission orders to three major private steel mills and the government-designated factory in Charleston, West Virginia, to triple the production of armor plate and metal ingots. Although armor plate manufacturing has increased by more than 100% since 1938, according to the secret report, the new equipment will not be able to actively produce within eighteen months. The secret report stated, "During this period, the amount of armor plate will still be too small to meet the needs of the program by the specified date, and losses during delivery must also be taken into account."

### Most U.S. Industrial Groups Support Roosevelt

Lewis' Broadcast Praising Willkie

Hull Says It's Deliberately Inciting the People

Washington – The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) has experienced a major split because its chairman, Lewis, announced his support for Republican presidential candidate Willkie in a national broadcast on Friday night. Lewis's attacks on Roosevelt and praise of Willkie yesterday aroused severe condemnation from most leaders of the CIO. According to Roosevelt's secretary, O'Leary, protest telegrams from labor groups and individuals related to the CIO poured into the White House like snowflakes. Secretary of State Hull said that Lewis's statement that Roosevelt is leading the United States into war is completely absurd. Many leaders of the CIO also publicly rejected Lewis in telegrams sent to the White House. Hull said that Lewis is deliberately inciting the people to resist President Roosevelt. O'Leary, representing the White House, announced that more than 200 telegrams from the CIO and other leaders have been received, all opposing Lewis and rejecting his political leadership. O'Leary also said that the President has been very busy lately and has not personally listened to Lewis's speech. He also said that Murray, chairman of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee district branch, stated in a telegram to the White House that the members he leads will reject Lewis. In addition, Bitner, chairman of the United Mine Workers of America, also expressed his support for President Roosevelt. Furthermore, representatives from the headquarters of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, the Textile Workers Union of America, and the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union also agreed to re-elect President Roosevelt, and their supporting telegrams have been sent out. Stribling, president of the New York State Industrial Union Council, which is affiliated with the CIO, who expressed his support for President Roosevelt in September, recently announced that he is making statewide broadcasts to condemn Lewis. In addition, Abraham, the first vice president of the New Jersey Industrial Union Council, said, "I recognize Lewis as my leader and condemn his betrayal of organized labor." Furthermore, Bridges, the leader of the Pacific Coast Regional CIO, declined to comment on Lewis's actions. However, Haywood, the national organizing director of the CIO, said that he and the district leaders and members of New York support Lewis's actions, and said that he has spoken by phone with the leaders in Buffalo, Boston, Rhode Island, and Detroit, and they all support Lewis. According to reports, in his national broadcast on Friday night, Lewis accused President Roosevelt of having war as his motive and goal, saying that if Roosevelt is re-elected, the United States will face great misfortune, and stated that if the CIO elects Roosevelt, it will be a vote of no confidence in him. If Roosevelt is re-elected, he will resign from his position as leader of the CIO. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Portland – Senator Norris stated yesterday that he supports President Roosevelt's re-election, while denouncing Republican candidate Willkie as a greedy and unbenevolent mouthpiece of Germany. At the same time, Senator Clark, who has often harshly criticized Roosevelt, is now also supporting Roosevelt's third term. He said, "I have always opposed any president serving three terms, but Willkie's hypocritical words have made me feel that he is not qualified to be elected president." (United Press dispatch, 27th)

### Change of Commander of French Forces in Vietnam

Vichy – The Ministry of the Army recently appointed General Mordant as commander of the French forces stationed in Vietnam, succeeding General Martin. General Mordant will soon depart for Hanoi to take office. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

### Behind-the-Scenes Influence in Britain: Roosevelt Warns Pétain That If France Submits to Military Cooperation with Germany, the U.S. Will Take Over French Territories in the Western Hemisphere

Washington – Official sources here revealed last night that Britain is striving to prevent or limit French-German cooperation in the European war, and now President Roosevelt has been exerting American diplomatic influence behind the scenes of Britain's efforts. Secretary of State Hull only outlined the main points of the courageous strategy set by the President. He said that the President has personally sent a letter to French Premier Marshal Pétain regarding the status of French territories in the Western Hemisphere. The content of the letter has not been disclosed, but diplomatic circles believe that Roosevelt must have warned Pétain that France's submission to Germany's military cooperation demands may force the twenty-one republics of the Americas to invoke the Havana Act of Self-Defense. According to this act, the governments of European countries whose sovereignty has been lost or diminished due to war, their territories in the Western Hemisphere, the republics of the Americas have the right to jointly administer. Regardless of Roosevelt's wording, judging from Hull's cautious statement, it can be seen that the implication of the United States is to make Marshal Pétain aware that if the remaining traces of independence of the Vichy government are also eliminated, then France will see a change in the status of French Guiana, Martinique, and Guadeloupe. According to these sources, the above three locations defend the Panama Canal, which is one of the lifelines in the Western Hemisphere defense plan. Official sources also indicated that Roosevelt has repeatedly reaffirmed his intention to assist Britain in various ways "to avoid war." Roosevelt once declared that, despite the urgency of the election, he will maintain close contact with Washington in secret, from which it can be seen that his top priority is to strive to prevent France from participating in the European war, which, according to those close to the White House, is the most beneficial way to keep the war away from the United States. (International News Service dispatch, 17th)

### U.S. Emphasizes Havana Declaration

Washington – It was disclosed here yesterday that President Roosevelt has once again warned the Vichy government that the United States will never recognize the transfer of sovereignty of European countries' territories in the Western Hemisphere. The person who disclosed this was Secretary of State Hull. Hull stated that President Roosevelt delivered a U.S. note to the French ambassador in Washington on the day Marshal Pétain and Hitler held their summit. Hull also stated that since the Havana Conference, the United States has sent several notes to France, so this recent note concerning France's territories in the Western Hemisphere is a clear matter. Well-informed sources said that Roosevelt told France that the United States and other American republics will not allow any transfer of sovereignty over European territories in the Western Hemisphere. It is generally believed here that the U.S. government has been particularly concerned about the French island of Martinique for several weeks, because the French fleet is heavily concentrated there. It is widely believed that the U.S. government is deeply concerned that Britain and France may engage in warfare near the American coast. Since France's surrender, there are as many as one hundred American-made aircraft stored there. Britain and the United States have made several attempts to purchase these aircraft from the French authorities on Martinique and the Vichy government, but the French have refused to sell them. (Taiwan Public News Agency dispatch, 27th)

Washington – Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that President Roosevelt sent a letter to the French ambassador to the United States a few days ago, which was forwarded to the Vichy government, regarding the negotiations between France and Germany and their impact on American interests. Although Hull declined to elaborate on the content of the letter, it has now been confirmed by other sources that the U.S. President asked the Vichy government to pay attention to the policies agreed upon at the Havana Pan-American Conference. The U.S. President's letter was likely accompanied by a warning that if the status of the French territories in the Western Hemisphere changes, they will be placed under U.S. protection. Hull told reporters that he has not yet received a reply from Vichy. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

### French Don't Want to Fight Britain

Hanoi – Vietnam was closely awaiting the Vichy government's decision on the prelude to the agreement with Hitler last night. Local newspapers yesterday competed to publish news about the meeting between Marshal Pétain and Hitler. The French here believe that France will not declare war on Britain, including French Vietnam. However, they are gradually clarifying the new position of French Vietnam among the Axis powers. According to news reports, people here are now criticizing Britain, blaming it for instigating Thailand to oppose Vietnam. However, apart from blame, few people are willing to fight Britain. Several French military officers here told a United Press reporter, "Fighting Britain is like fighting a friendly country and being friendly to the enemy." However, Vietnam's gradual inclination towards the Axis powers can be seen in the authorities' refusal to allow British ships to enter Vietnam and the prohibition of all goods belonging to Britain. Vietnam's economic factors largely rely on Britain, so after this move, Vietnam must re-establish trade routes. A Japanese economic delegation is staying here, perhaps for this reason. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Hanoi – The French authorities here yesterday accepted Japanese instructions and detained the American-licensed cargo ship "Tai Po," which was carrying gasoline from German-owned and Mobil companies. The "Tai Po" was fully loaded with American raw materials worth US$10 million, intended to be transported from Vietnam to China. According to reports, this is the second time that French and Japanese authorities have detained an American cargo ship. The American ship "Xi Jiang" (transliteration), which was detained by the French and Japanese earlier, is still ashore in Haiphong, and the 8,000 tons of cargo that has not been unloaded from the ship is expected to be fully inspected by the Japanese last night. Transportation sailors here are now planning to load prohibited goods for transportation to Malaya and Hong Kong. The "Tai Po" is flying the Panama flag and is fully loaded with cargo, berthed in Haiphong, while the French and Japanese authorities are debating the matter. It is reported that this action was taken at the request of the Japanese to inspect American goods in Haiphong. While the French and Japanese were debating the matter, a Japanese inspector remained on board the "Xi Jiang." At the same time, it is widely rumored here among Japanese authorities that Japanese planes bombed the Yunnan-Burma Road, destroying two bridges on the road. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Editorial

### Japan's Serious Economic Difficulties

Japan's recent postures: on the one hand, revealing its hesitation, and on the other hand, failing to conceal its apprehension. Besides political reasons, if we try to analyze it from an economic perspective, it is not difficult to gain a clearer understanding.

Japan is known as a first-class power and is in the midst of a rapid and highly industrialized process. However, the focus of industrialization is still biased towards adapting to military needs, with no close connection to the general national economy and its purchasing power. For the sake of the national economy, it can only focus on the development of overseas commerce. At the same time, its resources are extremely poor, second only to Italy among the great powers. Therefore, it must rely on the import of resources from abroad. Japanese rulers, unable to abandon their policy of military competition and contention to remedy their weaknesses, and yet aware of the dangers of this phenomenon, therefore seek to realize the so-called "Japan-Manchukuo-China Economic Bloc," and more recently, extend it to the wealthy South Seas. When Konoe came to power, he made "establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Economic Sphere" and "promoting the planned development of heavy chemical industry and machinery industry" the fundamental cornerstone of establishing a highly national defense economy. However, the realization of the so-called East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is not only filled with elements of political and military control and can no longer be carried out by peaceful means, but the establishment and promotion of heavy industry requires a large import of foreign machinery and raw materials: in other words, the execution of both must strengthen its dependence on foreign markets, resources, and military supplies. This is an irresolvable contradiction.

What is even more unfortunate for it is that it has already been a time of very poor international relations for Japan when it began to implement its plans, and Japan's economic dependence on foreign countries conflicts with its political dependence. It is forming Japan and the German and Italian, which are also facing economic difficulties, are naturally unable to support Japan; while the largest markets and resource suppliers for Japan, Britain and the United States, are in sharp opposition to Japan. Before Konoe came to power, that is, until the collapse of the Yonai cabinet this summer, no matter what the political views of the previous cabinets were, they generally painstakingly maneuvered between Germany and Italy and Britain and the United States, in order to maintain the balance of its external political and economic relations. Only because of Japan's invasion of China and its insatiable expansionist intentions, Japan's economic position has gradually fallen into a difficult situation; the abolition of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, the U.S. government's moral embargo, and the notification system for the export of petroleum and scrap iron are all solemn warnings, gentle and strong sanctions, intended to prompt Japan to reflect. Recently, the Japanese chaebols' eagerness for quick success has prevented Konoe from making deep and thorough considerations, and they rashly allied the country's fate with Germany and Italy, which are at the peak of the war, in the illusion of completing their dream of encompassing East Asia and advancing to the South Seas. However, the effects of the alliance have not been seen, and international economic pressures have come one after another. Not only has the establishment of a high national defense economic structure no way to be established, but even the original external economic relations are difficult to continue to maintain, which is the obvious effect of this adventurous policy!

Japan's domestic economy had already fallen into a state of exhaustion due to the long and fruitless war of aggression against China. During the year since the outbreak of the European war, not only has the dream of industrial and trade prosperity in the previous European war not been realized, but the difficulties have become even greater. In terms of exports, because of the blockade of the European market and the trade restrictions and foreign exchange controls of the belligerent countries, Japan's foreign trade has greatly declined. Comparing the export figures, although the amount has increased, most of it is limited to the scope of the so-called yen bloc, and this increase is mostly due to the increase in prices; if we talk about the quantity, there is a clear decline, and therefore the ability to pay for the purchase of foreign military supplies and raw materials is also greatly affected. As for the price problem, that has long formed a problem for previous cabinets, so the current cabinet had to promulgate the "September 18th Price Freeze Order" last month as an emergency measure to control prices, but it has not seen a significant effect. Moreover, the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact coincided with the U.S. ban on the export of scrap steel and scrap iron. Then, on October 2nd, President Roosevelt ordered the prohibition of the export of certain military supplies. The United Kingdom's important colonies also successively took parallel measures; on the first of this month, Egypt banned the transportation of large quantities of cotton to Japan; on the 9th, Canada announced a ban on the export of copper (the main customer of which is Japan); on the 19th, India stopped issuing licenses for the transportation of scrap steel and scrap iron to Japan; in addition, Mexico also followed in the footsteps of the United States on the 21st, banning the export of petroleum, mercury, and scrap iron, and canceling Japan's oil exploration rights already obtained in Mexico. Japan's important resources are dependent on foreign countries; oil accounts for 91 percent, pig iron accounts for 75 percent, copper accounts for 33 percent, aluminum accounts for 58 percent, and in addition, important precious metals such as nickel, antimony, and tungsten, and cotton and wool necessary for Japan's light industry, must rely on foreign imports, and the United Kingdom and the United States and their colonies are Japan's largest suppliers. In the first half of this year, the Japanese industry has reduced its profits by 71 percent compared to the second half of last year due to the lack of raw materials and rising prices. It is not difficult to imagine the serious impact of the continued implementation of the international embargo on Japan's entire production sector and even its military operations. On the other hand, it is reported that the United States is considering banning the import of Japanese raw silk; if realized, Japan will lose its largest overseas market and the main source of foreign exchange. Previously, a certain Japanese newspaper said that if the United States refuses to buy Japanese silk, Japan will also refuse to buy American cotton; if this is true, it is tantamount to declaring the bankruptcy of the silk industry and strangling its own cotton textile industry, which are both the main pillars of Japan's light industry. In short, under the universal and expanded embargo, not only will Konoe's attempt to establish a highly national defense economy be fatally hit, but also its external war will gradually fall into a state of unsustainable predicament.

Japan's southward policy was originally intended to resist international economic sanctions. Regardless of whether the markets and resources of the South Seas are insufficient to compare with the United Kingdom and the United States and their important colonies, as of this moment, except in Vietnam, where Japan may take whatever it wants, even the economic negotiations with the Dutch East Indies have not progressed smoothly. Sukeji Yasukawa said: "Even if the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Economic Sphere can be established, whether Japan can get rid of its economic dependence on foreign countries is still a question for us. If all foreign trade outside the yen bloc is lost, Japan may not be able to secure its resources to support a long-term war!" This is a truly insightful statement. Japan's recent softening of its external image and its re-engagement in political offensives against China are not difficult to explain. Looking at the serious difficulties facing Japan today, it can be asserted that they cannot be dealt with by the piecemeal and contradictory countermeasures of Konoe and others.

The Japanese planes continued to strafe the aircraft, causing it to catch fire and burn. It is reported that the two guards were also wounded by gunfire. Lutz's injuries are not serious. Before leaving, the Japanese planes strafed trucks and cars fleeing from the city with machine guns. As the air raid was in progress, many residents fled from the city to the suburbs. The Japanese planes left within fifteen minutes after the first air raid alarm was sounded. Because their approach was not detected in time, an earlier alarm could not be given.

The Chinese army pursued their victory, successively capturing strongholds such as Sanjiangkou and Jianshan. By the 22nd, the remnants of the Japanese army had fled to Kanshanzhen and other places east of Xiaoshan, where they were surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese army.

Vichy, Political figures here have commented on the decision of the German and French leaders to cooperate in restructuring the European system. The key points are summarized as follows: (1) Four months after the Franco-German armistice, France has obtained the opportunity to abandon its isolation. To date, the French people have adopted a spiritual resistance to the German occupation. This resistance has the potential to brew incidents. Fortunately, a glimmer of hope is now seen, and all aspects of life will return to normal. (2) The victorious nations have already considered how they might cooperate with the defeated enemy. If the victorious nations of 1918 had also had this motive and adopted different methods towards Germany, Europe might not have had to undergo twenty years of carnage. (3) The reason why Hitler has adopted this approach now is because the new France has undergone significant changes in recent weeks. (4) The actions of the new France will be guided by integrity. Since Marshal Pétain has voluntarily agreed to cooperate, France should implement its proposals consistently and not hesitate. (5) This policy will inevitably be opposed by those who do not benefit from Franco-German cooperation. Britain will certainly engage in heavy propaganda. It is hoped that French public opinion will not be dazzled and will not engage in empty talk and reckless speculation about the policy of cooperation. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 27th)

Vichy, The content of the agreement reached between Pétain and Hitler at their meeting last week does not include territorial issues. However, the current regional system of France may undergo some changes. A reporter interviewed someone who personally attended the talks between Pétain and Hitler last week, who said that the following rumors are completely untrue: (1) Hitler demanded that France participate in the war against Britain. (2) Hitler demanded the use of the French Navy or French naval bases. (3) France agreed to cede Dakar, Diégo-Suarez, or other seaports of the French Empire. (4) Italy occupied the French Mediterranean coastline, including Nice. (5) The Axis powers demanded joint use of Tunisia and French Morocco. (6) The Axis powers demanded that France cede land outside of Alsace and Lorraine. As far as the reporter knows, Laval will return to Paris this week for negotiations. However, the content of the negotiations has not been specified and will only involve general and broad discussions on the principle of "complete cooperation." (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Vichy, France now has a possibility, namely to fully join the Axis powers, risking deviating from Britain and the United States. The purpose of the Axis powers' formation is to make Britain immediately decide its final policy, whether it be to negotiate peace or to wage a long-term war. At a major cabinet meeting last night, the government took a step to decide its fate, "the principle of 'cooperation' with the Axis powers" to "build a new order and peace in Europe." The participants unanimously approved. This cabinet meeting, which lasted one hour and fifteen minutes, also fully ratified the agreement that Marshal Pétain and Hitler had reached on Thursday.

### Pétain Visits Occupied Area to Console French Prisoners of War

Clermont-Ferrand, France, "Paris Soir" recently reported that after meeting with German Führer Hitler on the 24th of this month, Marshal Pétain briefly stayed in Tours, a city in the occupied area, and went to a detention camp in the town of Amboise to comfort French prisoners of war. "When Marshal Pétain arrived at the place, thousands of French soldiers swarmed over and surrounded him. Among them were many soldiers who had participated in the First European War. Seeing their former supreme commander, they could not help but shed tears. Marshal Pétain was deeply moved. He asked them cordially, and was very pleased to learn that they were all in good physical and mental condition. Afterwards, the Marshal inspected the detention camp for a week and delivered a short speech to the soldiers, which was very somber. He said, "I not only deeply sympathize with your suffering, but also remember it in my heart and never dare to forget it. I hope that you will all be able to endure the suffering for a time." (Havas dispatch, 27th)

### Relations Between Germany and France Reach a Turning Point

Lyon, The "Temps" recently commented on the meeting between the French and German leaders, stating that after meeting with German Führer Hitler, Marshal Pétain returned to Vichy, but Cabinet Vice-President Laval did not return with him. Therefore, there are some reasons to believe that the negotiations between France and Germany, although they have reached the final stage due to the meeting between the two leaders, do not seem to have been fully completed. "In any case, we cannot but admit that the relations between the two countries established by the Franco-German armistice have reached a turning point." Furthermore, Marshal Pétain's visit to the occupied area was respected by the German authorities, presumably because it was sufficient to represent the will of the French nation to survive and its true national character. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Clermont-Ferrand, France, The newspapers today commented on the meeting between the French and German leaders, but were completely unaware of the content of the talks. Therefore, they all avoided speculating on how the situation would develop in the future. Among them, the "Journal" even asked, "Have the two sides adopted several important decisions concerning the future of France and Europe in this talk?" The "Action Française" also only stated, "Whatever Marshal Pétain does, it must be beneficial to the country. Therefore, the people of the whole country fully trust the Marshal." In addition, the "Progrès de la Région du Nord" reprinted an article from the German "Frankfurter Zeitung," which stated, "Among the defeated countries, France is the only one that can conduct negotiations with Germany in accordance with international law. And the soul of this French government is Marshal Pétain. Since he is rich in patriotism, no matter what path France takes in the future, Marshal Pétain has the right to judge." (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Clermont-Ferrand, France, "L'Écho de Paris" recently published an editorial commenting on the fact that Marshal Pétain was respected by the German authorities, which stated, "Marshal Pétain's attitude is completely the same as the attitude of the entire French people. At this time, the French people not only have the right to declare to all countries that they never want to have conflicts with other countries and deeply hate war, but also should do so. In short, France on the one hand wants to avoid war for itself, and on the other hand hopes that other countries can also eliminate war. As for our country's participation in the war this time, it is the result of the accumulation of various mistakes. As a result, it only caused all countries to encounter great calamities. Afterwards, although they realized their mistakes, it was too late, and they blindly fell into the wrong path. However, from beginning to end, they did not want war, and those who regarded war as a game were very few. In short, the misfortunes we have suffered are due to the mistakes made by these people. We, the French nation, not only cannot blame them, but also have a clear conscience." (Havas dispatch, 27th)

### Free French Forces Declare Agreements Surrendering Sovereignty Invalid

London, The headquarters of the Free French Forces, led by Commander de Gaulle, recently issued a statement saying that Hitler wants to force the Vichy government to recognize a kind of peace that involves the final abandonment of France and parts of its territory, and the transfer of naval and air force bases to Germany. We do not believe that any French person is willing to have their country suffer such humiliation. In the name of France, we declare that any agreements ceding France and its territory are invalid. Any direct or indirect collusion between the Vichy government and the enemy is a blasphemous act. We declare that no matter what conditions the enemy imposes on France, we will resolutely continue to fight alongside our Allied countries. General de Gaulle is currently in the Belgian Congo. According to news last night, de Gaulle arrived in Brazzaville on Thursday afternoon and was warmly welcomed by the people. He will broadcast on the radio from the Congo today, and then go to Léopoldville on Monday to meet with the officials there. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

### Clash Between Italian and Greek Forces on Albanian Border. Italian Side Claims Seven Greek Soldiers Captured. Telephone Service Between Rome and Athens Cut Off

The Albanian government announced here last night that Greek soldiers attacked Italian military outposts on the Albanian-Greek border yesterday. The announcement stated that the Greek attack on Italian military outposts occurred in Korytsa. At that time, there was an engagement between the Greek and Italian armies. Two Albanian soldiers died and three were injured. The announcement did not specify the number of Greek soldiers killed or injured, but stated that seven Greek soldiers were captured. Although the announcement stated that the border had returned to calm afterwards, the telephone service between Rome and Athens was suddenly cut off by midnight last night. Officials did not provide any explanation for the interruption of telephone service. A few hours before the announcement was issued, Italy suspended flights to Greece. Italian airline staff said that the flight routes are expected to be restored in ten days. At the same time, Mussolini's newspaper in Milan stated that "The fulcrum of the Axis powers' activities today is to carry out a general cleansing in the Mediterranean region." It is understood here that these activities may include Greece, because newspapers controlled by the Italian government have repeatedly threatened Greece recently. At the same time, another official announcement stated that on Friday night, three bombs exploded in the office of Lieutenant General Jacomoni of the Italian army stationed in Albania. According to this official announcement, the bombing was carried out either by "British" agents or by Greek agents. Before Albania was conquered by Italy, Jacomoni was the Italian ambassador to that country. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Here, a press release from yesterday stated that the situation in the Balkans has reached the breaking point because Greece used heavy troops to attack Italian military outposts on the Albanian border. The press release also stated that three bombs exploded in the residence of an Italian army lieutenant general in Albania, and it is rumored that they were planted by Greek or British secret operatives. Prior to this incident, the regular commercial air route between Rome and Athens had been suspended, and it was rumored that several Italian air squadrons had flown to Brindisi, opposite Corfu, Greece. The Stefani News Agency, the official news agency of Italy, issued a message stating that the Greek troops attacking the Italian military outposts in Korytsa are being pursued by Italian and Albanian troops, but it did not explicitly state whether the Italian army had pursued the Greek army into Greek territory. (International News dispatch, 27th)

Athens, Last night, all Greek political parties united behind Prime Minister Metaxas's strong support, because rumors of clashes between the Greek army and the Italian army on the Greek border have caused political figures here to fear that Italy will soon invade Greece. Government officials revealed that the Greek Communist Party, claiming 500,000 members, is the opposition that guarantees its support to the Prime Minister. The Communist Party printed a manifesto, stating its support for the current government, and adding a sentence at the end of the manifesto saying, "Metaxas, we are waiting for your orders." Also, after learning about the border skirmish in Albania and the complete cut-off of traffic between Greece and Italy, the situation became even more tense last night. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Rome, It was recently confirmed here that the foreign report that the Rome-Athens air route has been suspended due to the tense relations between Italy and Greece is completely incorrect. It is claimed that the planes are still flying as usual. (Haitong News dispatch, 27th)

### Romanian Government Orders Control of British Ships in Territorial Waters; British Side Lodges Strong Protest

Under the influence of Nazi Germany, the Romanian government in Bucharest has issued a new order to control all British ships within Romanian territorial waters and those chartered by British entities. The new order states that any seagoing or river vessels flying a foreign flag and registered in Romanian ports must obtain approval from the Romanian Naval Ministry before they can be chartered. All current charters must be submitted to the ministry by the end of October, at which point the ministry will decide whether to allow their continuation or to take over the vessels for naval use. Reportedly, fourteen grain ships, four tugboats, and two oil tankers owned by British entities are affected by this measure. These British ships have already been detained by Romania for several months. In addition, sixty-five other ships flying the British flag are also impacted by this order. These sixty-five ships were previously requisitioned by the Romanian authorities for military use, but there are concerns that they will now be transferred to German control. The order also declares that any attempt by foreign shipowners to withdraw their registered vessels from Romania will be treated as an act of sabotage and severely punished. Romania continues to take actions that violate international law. Of the original forty-four French ships, twenty-five grain ships, twelve tugboats, and four oil tankers in the Danube, those related to both England and France signed a contract on June 12 to sell the above-mentioned ships to the British side, to be re-registered under the British flag. However, before the complete transfer could be completed, the French government was overthrown, and Romania refused to allow them to be re-registered under the British flag, sending armed soldiers to board the ships and tow them upstream on the Braila River. Recently, German representatives inspected the ships and then had them towed downstream again. It is now clear that the ships are under German ownership. Romanian officials claim that since the ships owned and chartered by the British are registered in Romanian ports, Romania has the right to manage them. However, the British side refutes this, stating that Romania's actions are in conflict with international law, as the ships are registered with the British Consulate and enjoy extraterritorial rights. The fourteen tugboats and twenty-four grain ships chartered by a Greek shipping company that operate on the Danube have also been affected by the new Romanian order, and they have lodged a strong protest.

### Bloody Tragedy Occurs in Capital of Southern Country; Clash Between Student Factions

A bloody tragedy occurred last night in the capital of a southern country, Budapest. Republican students and Fascist students engaged in street battles using pistols and clubs. Hundreds of workers assisted the Republicans, and it is reported that many people were injured on both sides before the police restored order. The fighting reportedly took place near Belgrade University. The government of the Southern Country had previously ordered restrictions on the number of Jewish students at the university. In the days leading up to the incident, there was a Communist movement opposing the government's order at the university, causing great disorder and the suspension of classes.

The Bulgarian ship "Pentoho" has been carrying 500 Jewish refugees since this spring, searching for a place to settle for five months. It has been learned that the ship struck a reef off the island of Dodecanese yesterday and sank. The Italian authorities have dispatched personnel to provide assistance and have permitted the crew members to reside temporarily on the island. These Jewish refugees were originally from Germany and Czechoslovakia and had departed from Bleisburg, believing the Jewish Committee's assurance that Paraguay would accept them. However, upon arriving in Paraguay, they were refused entry and have been wandering on the ship ever since. (Haitong Agency, 27th)

### German Planes Attack British Isles in Waves; Fierce Air Battles Between British and German Forces Over the English Channel; London, the Midlands, and Scotland All Suffer Air Raids

Berlin: A correspondent for the Haitong Agency learned this morning from responsible sources that the German Air Force effectively bombed London last night. Hundreds of German aircraft departed for England to conduct bombing raids within three hours after sunset. Subsequently, more bombers departed from bases in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Norway, each carrying two tons of bombs. The weather was excellent last night, and all bombs hit their intended targets. (Haitong Agency, 27th)

Berlin: Yesterday, German aircraft attacked British military targets during daylight hours. Numerous factories were hit and caught fire, and railways, warehouses, docks, and oil depots suffered significant damage. Small squadrons of German light bombers, escorted by fighters, attacked factories outside London. On their return flight, they encountered a large squadron of British fighters over the Channel, resulting in an immediate air battle. Two British aircraft were shot down, and one was forced to land in France. All German aircraft returned safely to their bases. (Haitong Agency, 27th)

London: The people of the British Isles, having endured a day and night of intense air raids, cautiously emerged from their basements this morning. It is generally believed that the damage and casualties resulting from yesterday's air raids throughout the British Isles will be substantial. There was a lengthy lull from before midnight until early this morning, but the air raid warnings remained in effect. Yesterday afternoon, seven alerts were issued in the London area alone. However, it is believed that the scale of the German air offensive that penetrated the skies above London's outskirts during the daylight hours was smaller than that of Friday. Yesterday, German aircraft generally flew in formations of twenty and at altitudes of four to five miles above the ground. According to official reports, one formation was driven back to France by defending aircraft. During a few hours near midnight, a certain district of London was subjected to sporadic and disorganized attacks. German aircraft dropped high-explosive bombs and timed-delay bombs in the area, scattering shards of glass everywhere. Yesterday afternoon, a four-story residential building in the London area was destroyed by a bomb, resulting in numerous fatalities. A cinema was also pulverized by a high-explosive bomb, causing many deaths and injuries. An Anderson shelter was also struck by a high-explosive bomb, killing a man, a woman, and five children. Outside London, Liverpool and a town in southwestern Scotland were also attacked. Anti-aircraft batteries in Liverpool were very active in repelling the aerial threat. It is reported that a city in the Midlands experienced large-scale fires, and firefighters were seen battling 125 separate blazes at midnight. The bombs dropped by German aircraft in the city also included multiple timed-delay bombs, leading to numerous explosions afterward. Several factories and residential buildings in the city were destroyed, and many people were killed or injured. Residents of an apartment building and customers in a grocery store in the basement of the same building were killed or injured when the building was directly hit by a bomb and destroyed during the daylight air raid. Female members of the air raid protection team have been working for several hours among the rubble of the destroyed buildings, hoping to find more bodies, as workers at the grocery store feared that bodies were buried under the stone piles. (United Press, 27th)

London: German bombers intensified their attacks on London again last night. Since the beginning of the war, German aircraft have continuously attacked London overnight, marking the 50th time. As British air defenses put up fierce resistance against the invading German bombers, the sound of exploding bombs and anti-aircraft shells could be heard throughout the night. The German bombing began shortly after dusk and continued throughout the night until dawn this morning. The sound of exploding high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs could be clearly heard in the London suburbs. Meanwhile, British anti-aircraft guns continued to fire at German aircraft, adding to the terror with the sound of bursting steel. Other German aircraft also raided the northwestern and southwestern districts of the Midlands and Scotland, as well as the southern and southeastern regions of England. A hospital in the London suburbs was hit by fifteen incendiary bombs, but no casualties were reported as all patients had been evacuated to the basement. Near Sheerness, a German aircraft dropped a batch of oil-filled incendiary bombs, resulting in several deaths and the destruction of some buildings. Before dawn, a large factory in London caught fire and burned, and a cinema was destroyed. The raiders dropped multiple flares to guide German aircraft to the center of London. This night raid followed seven daylight air raids, and the overnight bombing ended at 7:30 a.m. (London summer time). (International Telegraph, 27th)

London: German fighter-bombers continued to attack the southeastern corner of England yesterday, but on a much smaller scale than on Friday, when the strength of the German aircraft was at its greatest. Yesterday, German aircraft flew under the protection of fighter escorts, resulting in less damage from the "Alert" in London. A bomb landed in a crowd in the center of the shopping district, killing at least six people. A grocery store, with its upper floors, was hit by a bomb, burying many people under the rubble. The German military had previously positioned artillery batteries near Grisnez Point and yesterday added a new gun west of the battery, firing across the Channel, but without casualties or damage. Royal Air Force bombers immediately took off and, despite German anti-aircraft fire, bombed the gun position. According to authorities, four enemy aircraft were shot down yesterday, and two British fighters are missing. The Air Ministry confirmed that few enemy aircraft reached the London area. Bombs fell in London and several parts of southeastern England, damaging buildings and causing some deaths and injuries. In a town in the West Midlands, an enemy aircraft dropped several bombs, destroying several houses. One enemy bomber was shot down on Friday night. (Reuter, 27th)

### British Air Force Attacks German Kiel Shipyards; Hamburg Oil Refinery Also Bombed

London: On Friday night, the British Air Force attacked the Kiel shipyards in Germany for two hours. Amidst the glare of searchlights and the fierce anti-aircraft fire, it was difficult for British aircraft to determine the results of their bombing. However, it is believed that shipyard facilities, warehouses, and ships have suffered extensive damage. A large mineral oil refinery in Hamburg was also heavily bombed for one hour, with more obvious results. Multiple fires broke out around the plant, and loud explosions followed the bomb strikes. The Schiphol airport in the Netherlands was also attacked three times. (Reuter, 27th)

### Ireland Suffers Another Air Raid

Dublin: Official sources stated yesterday that an aircraft of unknown nationality dropped bombs near Termon, marking the second air raid on the Irish Free State since the European war began. (Haitong Agency, 27th)

### German War Report

Berlin: This afternoon, the German war report stated that yesterday, German bomber formations continued to attack London and southern and central England. Despite the enemy's strong fighter defenses and heavy anti-aircraft fire, German aircraft were able to hit important military targets. A factory in Birmingham exploded, causing significant damage. The British transport ship "Empress of Britain," weighing 42,000 tons, was hit and caught fire, and the crew members abandoned ship in lifeboats. German heavy bombers attacked an airfield in northern Scotland, and smoke and fire filled the sky where the bombs landed. Last night, enemy aircraft attempted to bomb industrial facilities in northern and central Germany, but only one factory building was hit. Only a few residential houses in Berlin suffered damage. A total of nine enemy aircraft were lost yesterday, and four German aircraft are missing. (Haitong Agency, 27th)

### German Attempt to Mediate Peace; Bound to Fail

Chongqing: The current peace offensive being carried out by Germany and Japan in the East and the rumor that former German Ambassador Trautmann will soon come to China have caused great concern here, as no one has heard of any peace movement. The general opinion is that Germany and Japan's eagerness to resolve the Sino-Japanese war is well known, but because the conditions for peace between China and Japan are too far apart, this movement will have absolutely no chance of success. The Chinese side insists on the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops from Chinese territory, a condition that the Japanese side cannot accept. However, any conditions other than complete withdrawal are difficult for the Chinese side to accept. At present, the Chinese people are very optimistic about the closer cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East and are determined to continue the war of resistance until Britain and the United States are prepared to deal with Japan. Many believe that if Germany exerts any pressure on China at this time, it will undoubtedly fail. (Reuter, 27th)

According to official reports, the Chinese Cooperatives have obtained a base fund of one million yuan from the government and a monthly allocation of 20,000 yuan to establish five cooperatives in the Jin-Yu region and four cooperatives in the Zhe-Wan region for managing this new business. These cooperatives are an economic counter-strategy to disrupt the Japanese blockade policy. Once successful, they will be expanded to other areas. This type of guerrilla-style cooperation will be implemented using semi-military methods and will be of a mobile nature. Its purpose is to supply the army and civilians with handicrafts and machinery produced locally. (United Press, 27th)

Random Thoughts on the European War (20) (3)

### The Old and New Monarchs of Romania

— Michael and Carol

A man who had formally abdicated the throne with a three-fold decision suddenly announced that his departure from Romania was due to the oppression of political forces. He also stated that he had not abandoned Princess Helen and that Madame Lupescu was not the reason he gave up the throne. While Carol made these statements, people were preparing for his return to the throne in Bucharest with considerable success.

Queen Mother Marie, deeply concerned for her son, and seeing Carol's "prodigal son returning" spirit, tried her best to make up for his past mistakes and give him a path to redemption. She also wanted to reunite him with his wife. Therefore, she and Prime Minister Maniu secretly prepared everything so that Carol could safely return and inherit the throne again, reconciling with Helen.

At that time, Carol was staying at the home of a wealthy Romanian friend in London. He rented two planes and prepared 50,000 leaflets to be dropped over Bucharest, hoping to deter the then-powerful Peasant Party. The third plane was to carry Carol himself, following the two lead planes into Bucharest.

Romanian Abdicated King Carol. Carol's mistress, Madame Bescu

Unfortunately, the plan was leaked, and the Scottish police learned about it. Before Carol could take off, the British Home Office ordered him to leave the country within three days.

Carol's grand plan seemed to have failed, but he persevered and refused to give up. After returning to Paris, he told visiting journalists, "I will continue to fight." He was not exaggerating. A few months later, on June 6, 1930, he fulfilled his promise and flew back to his homeland, Bucharest. However, this time the plane came from France.

Two days after Carol arrived in Bucharest, Parliament, amidst the cheers of the people, officially restored Carol's original right of succession as crown prince, ratifying all legal benefits after the death of the late king on July 20, 1927. He took the title "Carol II," was officially crowned, and became the King of Romania. His son Michael was given the title "Grand Duke of Alba Iulia" to compensate him for his three years as king.

He originally planned to bestow the title of Queen on Princess Helen, but she did not consider the Queen's dignity an honor and insisted on not revoking the divorce decree. Soon after, Maniu was reinstated as Prime Minister and announced in Parliament that the government, cabinet, and regents had been notified in advance of King Carol's plan to return, and they had approved it, so King Carol's return to the throne could not be called a "rebellion." Later, Queen Mother Marie used all sorts of methods to reunite Carol and his wife, but Helen was unwilling to revoke the divorce decree, and Carol was unwilling to part with his mistress, Madame Lupescu. Therefore, the attempt to reconcile ultimately failed.

Carol had a leftist tendency in his political ideology, and at one time even considered himself a socialist. Romania was surrounded by watchful and covetous neighbors, and if it did not stand up, it would be in danger of being destroyed. Besides the rude military men around Carol, there were no senior officials or patriots with deep foresight. Compared to the governments of Britain or Germany, the difference was immeasurable. So he gradually removed them one by one, until all power was concentrated in his own hands. By 1937, all political parties in the country had disappeared. The only one that could compete with Carol was the not-so-glorious "Iron Guard." Its leader, Codreanu, was a handsome young man whose organization, the Iron Guard, was influenced by German ideas and supported by their money. The members of the Iron Guard were extremely arrogant, shouting loudly in the streets, plundering the people, and flogging Jews.

The power of the Iron Guard grew day by day, to the point that the government could not stop it, and Carol felt a chill down his spine. So, without informing Codreanu, he secretly summoned Goga, a poet who had been bribed by Jews, to be the prime minister. Carol's original intention was to have Romania threatened by some terrorism so that the Iron Guard would not climb on his head. In forty-five days, Goga indeed carried out a policy of mass murder, and the country was in a state of panic, unable to live in peace. Carol saw that the opportunity had arrived, and on February 10, 1938, after Goga had been in power for six years, his cabinet was finally dissolved. Goga was furious and ran out of the palace that night. Carol finally declared himself a dictator and appointed a nominal cabinet to be at his disposal. He announced a new constitution, and everything was renewed. Carol's internal worries were gone, and he was complacent. Little did he know that external troubles were deepening, and he would eventually be unable to solve the difficulties and be forced to abdicate to Michael.

Carol, from being a king of ten thousand chariots, was once again reduced to a commoner. It is difficult to say that he has no political ambitions, but he is still deeply in love with his mistress, Madame Lupescu. They have both passed through Italy and Yugoslavia and arrived in Switzerland. With a confidante by his side, he is a victor in another realm in the spirit of love.

The new monarch, Michael, had been at odds with his father's lover since he was a child and could not develop good feelings for her. When he was four years old, Madame Lupescu gave him a gold watch, but Michael hated her so much that he hated her gifts. He threw the gold watch against the wall and didn't even look at it. Another time, he was playing in the garden with some children, and Madame Lupescu was walking by. They all shouted the word "bitch" at her!

In recent years, Michael has grown older and made progress in everything. In addition, Madame Lupescu has a kind heart and knows how to win over her lover's son. After she put in a lot of effort, Michael finally changed his attitude towards Madame Lupescu. Last year, the father and son and Madame Lupescu spent the summer on the Mediterranean coast, and their relationship was very harmonious.

In this political turmoil, the Guards arrested the Greek arms tycoon Maratha, who owned several heavy industrial plants in Romania in addition to arms factories. Abdicated King Carol and Madame Lupescu were both major shareholders in his factories. There was a scandal between Michael and Maratha. Last year, Michael had an affair with Maratha's beautiful red-haired daughter. The father and son had a dispute because of this. This can also be said to be an unexpected incident. (The End) Romanian Abdicated King Carol. Carol's mistress, Madame Lupescu.

### Father of the Nation's Birthday Approaching, Savings Movement to be Promoted, Shanghai Citizens Unanimously Purchase Savings Certificates, Frugality and Virtue to Achieve the Goal of Nation-Building

The anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, on November 12th is fast approaching. All sectors of Shanghai will be celebrating at that time. All institutions, public organizations, schools, etc. will also be closed as usual, but no commemorative ceremonies will be held. All sectors will still focus on spiritual encouragement and material donations to support national policies and complete the great cause of rejuvenation. Furthermore, November 10th is the anniversary of the founding of the National Savings and Nation-Building Movement Committee. The authorities have stipulated that from November 10th to 16th will be the National Savings Movement Great Publicity Week. All sectors of Shanghai have also decided to take advantage of the Father of the Nation's birthday celebrations to expand and promote the Savings Movement to universally develop productive construction. All citizens must save their surplus and enthusiastically purchase savings certificates, or open savings accounts at the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, or the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to cultivate the virtue of thrift and achieve the goal of nation-building.

### Strictly Prohibit Businesses from Accepting Deposits

To Protect Depositors' Safety

And Maintain the Legitimate Business of Banks

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Guild of Shanghai have received Instruction No. 17922 from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the establishment of a bank and the operation of deposit-taking, lending, discounting, and exchange businesses must be registered in accordance with regulations. Businesses that engage in the aforementioned businesses but are not called banks, but are called companies, firms, or shops, must also be handled in accordance with regulations. This has been clearly stipulated in the Bank Registration Regulations. Ordinary businesses that engage in deposit-taking and other businesses have also been ordered to be banned by the Ministry. On August 7th of this year, in order to consolidate wartime finance and strengthen the management of banking business, the Ministry of Finance formulated and promulgated the Provisional Measures for the Management of Banks in Extraordinary Times. Article 1, Section 2 of the original measures stipulates, "Those who engage in receiving deposits, lending, discounting bills, exchange, or pawn business, and are not called banks, shall be regarded as banks." This refers to companies, banks, and money shops that engage in the aforementioned businesses. Ordinary businesses should be handled in accordance with the Ministry's repeated orders. Therefore, the ban is reiterated. If ordinary businesses are concurrently engaged in receiving deposits or handling exchange matters, they should be strictly banned, and those who report them should be rewarded and severely punished in order to protect depositors' safety and maintain the legitimate business of banks. In addition to the branch offices, all businesses are hereby ordered to comply with the regulations and handle them accordingly.

### National Rice Transport to Shanghai More Convenient Than Before

But Fees Still Need to be Paid and Certificates Obtained, so the Price is Affected. Since its establishment, the Civil Food Regulation Association has repeatedly decided to handle group orders for foreign rice. The 25th order has now been reached. All the rice from the 24th order that has been successfully traded can be loaded onto ships and arrive at the port by the end of this month, totaling 1,000 bags, all of which are No. 2 Saigon rice. The transaction price is 27 yuan in national currency per bag (one stone and two and a half dou). Once it arrives in Shanghai, it will be distributed to the subscribers of the 24th batch. The 25th batch will be telegraphed to Saigon for contact within days. After the transaction is completed, it can be loaded onto ships and transported to Shanghai. The association hopes that major factories, companies, shops, and institutions, groups, etc., will actively participate in the collective purchase of rice in order to increase the rice reserves and relieve the panic of civil food. The source of national rice has attracted the close attention of Chinese and foreign residents in the city. As far as we know, the transport of national rice to Shanghai is slightly easier than the transport of stored foreign rice, because the rice-producing areas in China have been occupied as war zones one after another, and the situation in each place is special, but the current situation is better than in the past, otherwise it would not be possible to export. At the same time, the issuance of this permit is quite restricted, so most of the national rice currently transported to Shanghai is smuggled into the port, and its price is lower. However, we hope that a large amount can be transported here, because the autumn harvest in the rice-producing areas is very abundant. We hope that the authorities of the two concessions will quickly advance

### After the Opening of the Burma Road, the Southwest Travel Route

Since the opening of the Burma Road, all sectors have been very interested in the route. The following is an exploration of the route. The road starts from Kunming, Yunnan, and ends at Wanting on the Sino-Burmese border. The total length of this line is 959.4 kilometers, and it takes six days to reach. The following are the en-route meals and accommodation and highway bus fares. On the first day, departure from Kunming to Chuxiong, a total of 193 kilometers. The car travels for nine hours, and the fare is 17.4 yuan per person in national currency. Chuxiong has a travel agency to receive guests, and the room fee is from 0.6 yuan to 2 yuan. On the second day, from Chuxiong to Xiaguan, a total of 219 kilometers. The car also travels for nine hours, and the fare is 19.75 yuan. Xiaguan also has a travel agency guesthouse, and the room fee is from 1 yuan to 2 yuan. On the third day, from Xiaguan to Yongping, a total of 119 kilometers. The car travels for seven hours, and the fare is 10.75 yuan. Yongping Station has a travel agency guesthouse, and the room fee is from 0.6 yuan to 2 yuan. On the fourth day, from Yongping to Baoshan, a total of 137 kilometers. The car takes about eight hours, and the fare is 12.35 yuan. The travel agency also has guesthouses, and the room fee is from 0.6 yuan to 2.5 yuan. On the fifth day, from Baoshan to Mangshi, a total of 205 kilometers. The car travels for ten hours, and the fare is 18.5 yuan. The travel agency guesthouse has a room fee from 1 yuan to 2.5 yuan. On the sixth day, from Mangshi to Wanting, a total of 86 kilometers.

There are also highway buses that can pass, and the white cars can reach directly. However, due to business relations, the Yunnan-Burma Highway Bureau only allows ordinary passenger cars to travel from Kunming to Baoshan. Between Baoshan and Lashio, there are small cars driven by Indians, about 15 rupees per person.

According to travel industry news, a travel route has recently been opened between Hong Kong and Shaoguan, which is extremely convenient to travel to various places in the southwest. Many people have recently gone from Shanghai to the mainland, taking this route via Hong Kong. The following is an exploration of its detailed itinerary. From the Hong Kong pier to the Kowloon Tsim Sha Tsui Station, take the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway intercity train to Shenzhen, take a boat to Sha Chuyong, walk to Kwai Chung, take a bus to Tanxia via Qiankeng, and then take a bus or steamer (both land and water) to Huizhou, passing through Laolong (both land and water) to the lighthouse, and then take a train directly to Qujiang (Shaoguan). The entire journey takes 14 days, and the travel expenses are only 150 yuan in national currency, which is more convenient than taking the Burma Road.

### The Business Corps is Stationed in the Northern Part of the Central District for Another Month

### Residents of Qianjiagang Prepare to Move

Japanese Army Plans to Expand it into a Road

The Situation in Western Shanghai Relaxes Slightly. After the Japanese army blockaded the lanes and alleys of Jessfield Road and Rue Amiral Courbet, the situation relaxed slightly two days ago. The Japanese army's inspection of vehicles and pedestrians was not as strict as it had been a few days ago. The traffic intersection at Jessfield Road, Yanjiazhai, has also been opened, allowing residents to go out to shop. However, the location where Japanese Military Police Sergeant Sato was shot in Qianjia Lane, Yuyuan Road, is still sealed off. The Japanese army recently ordered all residents of the lane to move out, planning to demolish the houses there and expand it into a road. They have now started surveying. Yesterday, the Japanese army posted an announcement in the area, forcing residents to implement the following matters: (1) In order to prevent "anti-Japanese elements" from sneaking in, a civilian police force will be organized in this area. (2) If any suspicious persons are found sneaking in, the military police team should be notified immediately, so each household must set up an emergency alarm bell. (3) In order to expand the road in Qianjia Lane, residents should prepare to evacuate. It is also said that the purpose of this measure is to thoroughly eliminate "anti-Japanese elements" and there is no intention to threaten the lives of residents. The residents of the area have been sealed off for five or six days and have been frightened. They have a feeling of surviving a tiger's mouth, and they are now making plans to move to a better place. Also, the Tianzhuang in Yuyuan Road, which is close to the location of the incident, and the entrance to Lane 608 outside the village were sealed off for two days, but it was still possible to enter and exit. Now, after completely clearing the blockade last Sunday, it has returned to its original state.

### The Public Concession is on Alert as Usual. Up to One Million People Have Been Searched.

Since the Public Concession implemented the alert on August 9, the security situation has been improving day by day. According to the report of the Police Department of the Municipal Council, the number of criminal cases in September has been reduced to 2,257. Therefore, although the French Concession has lifted the blockade, the barbed wire fences and other obstacles set up along the border of the Public Concession, as well as the Chinese and Western detectives, are still stationed as usual to ensure good order within the territory. In order to prevent petty criminals from rioting, the Police Department has carried out strict inspections of pedestrians in Areas A and B, and up to one million people have been searched. A total of 392 criminals have been arrested, and the reserve team has been active. At the gaps in the blockade lines in the border area, a total of 838,852 pedestrians entering and leaving have been inspected, an average of 27,961 people per day.

### British Overseas Chinese Refused to Join the Army, Trying to Settle and Escort Them

Some Transferred to Hong Kong to Serve as Volunteer Corps

British overseas Chinese in this port, because of their patriotism, have volunteered to serve as volunteers. A group of them left Shanghai for Singapore on the 22nd of the lunar calendar to join the army, intending to serve their motherland. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Singapore, most of them were refused enlistment. British overseas Chinese in this port were quite angry after hearing the news. According to sources from the British military in Shanghai, the reason why the British overseas Chinese volunteers from Shanghai were refused to return by the Singapore authorities has been clarified. It is said that because the British army in Singapore has sufficient military strength, there is no need for them to serve, so the British overseas Chinese in this port were sent back to Shanghai. However, because their loyalty and patriotism are commendable, some have been trying to settle and escort them into the army, and they have been transferred to Hong Kong to serve as British naval volunteer corps.

### The Third Anniversary of the Death of the Panchen Lama

Today is the third anniversary of the death of the Panchen Lama. During the period of the consecration ceremony of the bronze statue in Shanghai, Master Rongzeng will perform rituals to commemorate the Panchen Lama. The Lama came to the Eastern Land to promote the Secret Buddhism. Later, Duan Zhiquan and Qu Wenliu organized the Bodhi Society and invited Master Rongzeng to preside over the affairs of preaching the scriptures, so that the relationship between China and Tibet has today's friendship. The Lama passed away on October 28 of the Republic of China in Yushu before the Gudu Temple. Therefore, today is the day, and Yang said that October 28 is also the day. Also, people in the Dharma Assembly said that many people participated in this offering of a thousand lamps, and it could have been performed for many days, but due to the limited date of the Dharma Assembly, it was decided that Master Rongzeng would perform the Long Life Buddha knotting top on November 3, and a special practice of Avalokiteśvara Dharma would be held on the 4th. Those who wish to participate can register with the Dharma Assembly in advance to complete the merits of this offering of a thousand lamps.

### 2,000 Pigs Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, Meat Prices May Fall Back

Stock-out Yesterday, De Facto Market Shutdown

Selling for More Than Three Yuan Per Pound

Most of the pigs used in this city come from Nantong area in Jiangbei. They are shipped to the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou for auction by Japanese merchant ships. After various procedures, the price of pork has repeatedly risen. Unexpectedly, the source of pigs was suddenly cut off the day before, resulting in thousands of butcher shops and meat stalls throughout the city yesterday having no goods to wholesale and a de facto market shutdown. Although a few stores sold the meat they had stored the day before yesterday, the price was unusually expensive, with some shouting as high as three yuan per catty, an unprecedented precedent for meat prices. However, the reporter learned from the Pork Guild yesterday that 2,000 pigs had been shipped from Jiangbei to Shanghai yesterday afternoon and unloaded at the Huishan Wharf in Hongkou and transported to the "Livestock Market" on Gongping Road. Therefore, the pork panic in this port should subside today and prices may recover.

### Yu Jingeng Ambushed Near Longhua

The Ningbo air defense monitoring team immediately issued an air raid report. The plane circled twice over Baiguan and invaded Cao'e, dropping two bombs. The loss is unknown. After dropping the bombs, the plane returned northwest along the original route.

### Increased Wage Disputes in the Western Clothing Industry, Labor and Management Sign an Agreement

Labor and management of Daxinjie Western Clothing Store signed an agreement after a strike and market shutdown over demands for increased wages which the Labor Bureau politically resolved. The details of the agreement are as follows: (1) For this year's Western-style tops, the standard wage for each piece, which is normally 4 yuan, will be increased to 4 yuan. (2) For Chinese and Western coats, the standard wage for each piece, which is normally 4 yuan, will be increased to 4.4 yuan. (3) The standard wage for vests, which is normally 1.6 yuan or 1.7 yuan, will be increased to 2.2 yuan. (4) 0.5 yuan for each light shell, 0.5 yuan for each lined shell.

(6) The above-mentioned wages are conditional on uniform standard workmanship. (7) The agreement shall be effective from the date of signing, with a term of one year. During this period, there shall be no increases or decreases, or other conditions shall be proposed.

### Shanghai YWCA Plans to Establish a Nursery

Fundraising through Charity Sale

The Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association held its 32nd annual meeting yesterday at 2 PM at the Moore Memorial Church. Over 200 members attended. The professional women's division proposed establishing an economical cafeteria, the homemakers' division proposed hiring legal counsel, the labor division proposed building labor dormitories and establishing a labor middle school, the sports division proposed building a gym, and the student division proposed establishing a library.

Over 700 women and children sheltered there were dispersed and sent home separately.

Yesterday was U.S. Navy Day - No Ceremony Held - Fearing Infiltration by Undesirables - Only Private Banquets Held for Celebration

Yesterday marked the 165th anniversary of the founding of the U.S. Navy and the birthday of Theodore Roosevelt, the "Father of the U.S. Navy." Due to the proclamation by the U.S. President designating this day as a day for civilians to recognize the Navy, in peacetime, the U.S. Navy holds many banquets and celebrations wherever it is stationed. Traditionally, civilians must be invited, naval officers must speak with them, and the interior of warships must be visited to familiarize them with the duties and circumstances of the Navy. On this day last year, with the "mysterious cloud" enveloping the four corners of America's first line of defense, and to act cautiously to prevent undesirable elements from taking the opportunity to infiltrate the various fleets of ships, Admiral [name] issued a public notice the day before, stating that all officers and soldiers were prepared to fulfill this duty and responsibility to protect American rights and interests. There were private banquets to celebrate. No other ceremonies were held because Admiral Hepburn left Shanghai on the flagship Augusta to participate in the Asian Fleet's training exercises. Therefore, due to the above reasons, the American expatriate community in this city was unable to hold the grand tour of the flagship as in previous years.

### Chartered Ships to Evacuate Nationals Soon Arriving in Shanghai - U.S. Community Preparing Actively

Missionaries in China to Continue Work - Schedules for Three Ships Determined - Since the U.S. government successively advised its citizens residing in the Far East to evacuate, most American expatriate women, children, and residents without a need to remain in Shanghai have been preparing to board ships home to ensure their safety. Of the approximately 4,000 American expatriates in Shanghai, over 2,500 have already registered with the U.S. Consulate General, requesting assistance with evacuation. The remaining 1,500 are finding it difficult to leave Shanghai temporarily due to work-related reasons. As for the British expatriate community in Shanghai, there is no such movement yet.

American Expatriates in Inland Areas Concentrating in Shanghai

The Shanghai Times reports that the first of the ships sent by the United States to the Far East to evacuate nationals, the SS President McKinley, is scheduled to arrive here in early November. The deadline is approaching, so the American expatriate community is busy making final preparations. The evacuation of American expatriates in accordance with the instructions of the State Department is gradually taking concrete form as a group of American expatriates from inland areas concentrates in Shanghai. It is reported that there are already 40 American expatriates in Shanghai, mostly family members of American missionaries, wives and children of U.S. Navy and Marine Corps officers, and American civilians, who are now preparing to depart on the SS President McKinley.

Missionaries in China to Continue Work

According to explanations from the National Christian Council of China regarding the departure of family members of church workers, the Chinese and foreign leaders in charge of church work recently held a meeting to exchange views on the attitude of Christian churches toward the evacuation. A definitive policy has not been decided, but it is expected that most churches will continue their work, and very few missionaries will leave. However, most of their family members will return to the United States, possibly numbering in the hundreds.

SS President McKinley Fully Booked

It is reported that there is a great rush among American expatriates to purchase tickets on the SS President McKinley. According to the American President Lines, the managing agent for the evacuation ships, the number of pre-sold tickets has not been tallied, but there are still many people purchasing them. Therefore, the ship may be fully booked.

Schedules for Three Ships Determined

The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury also reports that the American President Lines recently announced that the U.S. evacuation ship SS President McKinley is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on November 2, depart on November 3, travel via Australia and Manila, and arrive in San Francisco, USA, on December 3. The lowest-priced first-class tickets on this ship have already been fully booked, but there are still many berths available in the steerage class. The SS President Pierce is now scheduled to arrive here on November 8, depart on November 13, arrive in Hong Kong on the 14th, arrive in Kobe, Japan, on November 15, and arrive in San Francisco on November 27. The lowest-priced first-class tickets have also been fully booked, while the economy class is for American expatriates from North China. The SS President Polk is scheduled to arrive in the East on November 19. Details of the sailing schedule and fares are not yet known.

British and American Investments in Shanghai Are Significant

According to inquiries made by reporters with British sources, it is easier for American expatriates to evacuate Shanghai than for British expatriates because American interests in China are mainly in trade, and industrial investment in China is relatively secondary. If U.S.-Japan relations break down and shipping is disrupted, trade will naturally disappear. American expatriates engaged in import and export trade will have nothing to do and will have no need to stay. The situation for British expatriates is slightly different. Foreigners came to Shanghai, with the British being the first and most numerous. Over the decades, they have worked hard and have deep roots. The textile industry, the hardware industry, etc., all have huge British investments. This kind of industry cannot be moved, nor can it be abandoned. Therefore, they can only maintain the status quo until the moment before the outbreak of war. According to Remer's estimate, British investment in China totaled $119 million, with three-quarters in Shanghai. American investment in China totaled $19 million, with 64% in Shanghai. Some British and American expatriates are confident that the situation will not deteriorate further, so they believe there is no need to return home. Others, although they acknowledge the seriousness of the situation, are tied down by business and would rather let things take their course than abandon their businesses.

### Czechoslovak National Day Today - Czech Expatriates Celebrate Solemnly - Flag Raising in the Morning, Special Broadcast in the Afternoon - Czech Troops Fighting Shoulder-to-Shoulder with British Troops

Today is Czechoslovak National Day. Czech expatriates in Shanghai will commemorate it at the Czech Association at 214 Avenue Albert. A solemn flag-raising ceremony will be held at 8:20 AM. At 2:15 PM, a special program will be broadcast on the China Press radio station (wavelength 208 meters, frequency 1440). A commemorative banquet will be held at the Czech Association at 9 PM. Czechoslovakia, a Central European country, declared its independence on October 28, 1918, after 300 years of subjugation. Today marks the 22nd anniversary. Fifteen million Czech people around the world celebrate together. However, the newly independent Czechoslovakia was annexed by Germany by force after regaining its freedom for 20 years. On the same day last year, the Czech people, deeply patriotic, commemorated National Day, resulting in hundreds of Czech students being shot, tortured, or detained in concentration camps. These horrific measures ultimately failed to prevent the Czech people from praying for the Allied victory and the liberation of their homeland. Five million Czech expatriates overseas share the highest wish of the oppressed compatriots in their homeland: the rebirth of Czechoslovakia. They commemorate this National Day with solemn sorrow. The Czech troops in England are fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with the British and other Allied forces to achieve the independence of their homeland.

### French Embassy to Move from Shanghai to Beiping - Mrs. Cosme and Daughters Went North Months Ago - Awaiting Mr. Cosme Himself and Entourage

The Shanghai Times reported yesterday (the 26th) that the French Embassy in China will close its Shanghai office and move to Beiping. Mrs. Cosme, the wife of French Ambassador Cosme, and her two daughters left Shanghai months ago and arrived in Beiping. They are waiting for the French Ambassador and his entourage to arrive there permanently. All members of the French Embassy staff will also be stationed in Beiping. The French Embassy in China was stationed in Beiping from the time it was first established until 1935, when an office was added in Shanghai. Part of the Ambassador's duties was handled in this office.

### Court Orderlies, Clerks, and Guards Request Salary Increase - Authorities Say They Must Consult the Ministry of Justice - Promise to Lend a Small Amount Before Receiving Ministry Order

Officials, court orderlies, clerks, guards, and jail guards of the Jiangsu Higher Court, the Second and Third Branches of the Jiangsu Higher Court, the First and Second District Courts of the Special District, the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court, and the Special District Prison received salary increase orders from the Ministry of Judicial Administration at the end of August of this year. Judges received a 20% increase, clerks received a 40% increase, and other officials with monthly salaries above 200 yuan received a 20% increase, while those with monthly salaries below 200 yuan received a 40% increase. However, court orderlies, clerks, guards, and jail guards were not included. As for temporary recorders, etc., who are of an employee nature, they all received an increase of 20 yuan, and all increases were retroactive to January of this year. Most of the court orderlies, clerks, guards, and jail guards receive monthly salaries of 37.5 yuan, and very few receive 40 yuan. The full monthly salary is not even enough to buy five pecks of rice, and there is no money left for rent, groceries, or pocket money. They were forced to request their superiors to increase their salaries by 20 yuan each from January, in accordance with the employee regulations. There are hundreds of court orderlies, clerks, guards, and jail guards in the various courts and prisons. During this extraordinary period, although they feel the pain of life, they are able to maintain order. The various courts and prison authorities understand that the demands of the court orderlies and guards are purely for livelihood issues. They have now declared to the representatives that they must consult the Ministry of Justice and, before receiving the Ministry's order, they will temporarily lend a small amount. The court orderlies, clerks, guards, and jail guards request understanding. It is expected that a satisfactory solution can be reached within a few days.

Shen Jiqing, a 26-year-old teacher at a public school in Huzhou, and Gao Yinan, a woman with secondary education, fell in love several years ago because they were well-matched in age, appearance, and education. When they met, they addressed each other as brother and sister and often strolled hand in hand. Their love reached its peak, and they formally held a wedding on January 30, 1938,

and began to cohabit. Who knew that the foundation of love was not strong? After marriage, they often quarreled. After Gao Yinan gave birth last year, the couple's relationship deteriorated further. On December 13 of last year, Gao suddenly left and never returned. Her husband, Shen Jiqing, repeatedly sent letters to his in-laws in hopes of reuniting the broken mirror, but Gao ignored them. Shen was forced to sue Gao in the First Special Court's Civil Division through lawyer Jiang Pingfan, citing the Civil Code's stipulation that husband and wife have an obligation to cohabit, and requesting that Gao be ordered to

return home and cohabit.

The court, upon receiving the complaint, summoned the defendant Gao Yinan to court in the First Civil Division presided over by Judge Tao. However, Gao claimed to be ill and did not appear. Instead, she sent her sister, Gao Yihai, to court, who stated that she could not comply with the summons for a reason. The plaintiff, Shen Jiqing, appeared in court and testified that he had been married to the defendant Gao Yinan for nearly three years. Their relationship was quite good before and at the beginning of the marriage. However, in December of last year, the defendant left due to a quarrel and has not returned since. He repeatedly sent letters requesting her to return home and reunite, but the defendant

did not respond.

He was forced to file a lawsuit for cohabitation. The plaintiff works in the public school in Huzhou, and although his monthly salary is only 30 to 40 yuan, the defendant is also capable of supporting herself. If they jointly maintain the family, they may not feel particularly distressed. Before the marriage, the defendant was very clear about the plaintiff's background and ambitions. It was completely unexpected that the defendant would leave for a trivial matter and disappear like a yellow crane. Lawyer Jiang Pingfan then presented several pieces of evidence to the court and stated that the defendant has not returned home, and it is feared that a third party is

obstructing her.

It is said that the defendant herself does not harbor any particular ill will towards the plaintiff. He requested that the court reschedule the summons for the defendant to appear in court in person. When the couple meet, they may recall their past affection and reconcile as before. The court reviewed the statements and adjourned the proceedings for the two parties to attempt reconciliation. If reconciliation fails, the court will schedule another hearing, and the defendant must appear in court to be questioned. The court then adjourned.

### Extortion by Threat - Three Defendants Tried Together

Zhu Yumin (34 years old) from Anhui, residing at No. 42, Lane 1034, Gordon Road, recently lost his job. He hatched a plan, colluding with Lou Minwei from Ningbo and Wei Zhengquan, to write a threatening letter to Zhu Jing'an, the owner of the Yihe Pawnshop at No. 1030 Tonglu, claiming to be connected to the guerrillas and demanding 500 yuan to settle the matter. The Putuo Road Police Station dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to arrest them and escort them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention pending trial. The case was rescheduled. On the 25th, at noon, the detectives handling the case apprehended Lou and Wei at the Shanghai Dance Hall on Guangdong Road, brought them to the police station, and escorted them to the Criminal Division of the court the next day. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a public prosecution on charges of extortion by threat and requested a postponement. The victim was not present. Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the two defendants, but their statements were evasive. He ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the trial to be combined with that of Zhu.

### Failed Loan Request - Robbed a Ring from Hand

Zhang Zusui from Ningbo was prosecuted for robbery. At 9 AM on the 13th of this month, in collusion with his cousin Zhang Xiyan, at No. 8, Lane [name] Deli, Avenue Edward VII, he asked his aunt Wu Zhangshi for a loan but was unsuccessful. He forcibly took a gold ring worth 200 yuan from her hand and fled. The Huishi Police Station was notified, and Chinese and foreign detectives apprehended him on Yunnan Road the day before yesterday, brought him to the police station, and escorted him to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted him for robbery and requested a postponement. When questioned, the defendant admitted that it was his cousin Zhang Xiyan who committed the act and begged for leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the trial for further review.

### Two Robberies in Shanghai West at the Same Time Last Night

One Robber Injured and Escaped by Hiring a Car - Another Robber Shot and Captured. At around 9:30 PM last night, two robbers suddenly broke into No. 76 Jing'an Temple Road. Each brandished a pistol and threatened the occupants at will, resulting in the theft of 500 yuan in national currency. As the robbers were leaving with the loot, a visitor, Mr. A, followed behind. After walking a few steps, he encountered Chinese police officer No. 2768 and

reported the information.

The police officer

bravely gave chase

and fired a shot, hitting one of the robbers. The other robber dropped his pistol, which held six bullets in its chamber. The injured robber managed to hire a streetcar and escaped into the darkness, leaving no trace. The pistol and bullets were seized and taken to the police station for safekeeping, pending investigation and arrest of the robbers. At the same time, near Changping Road on Hart Road in Shanghai West,

male and female pedestrians

were each robbed. Three robbers, one armed with a gun, blocked their way and

threatened them into silence.

Just as they were about to rob them, the victims cried for help. Russian officer (Woschikoff) No. 401 of the Gordon Road Police Station,

who was patrolling nearby,

heard the alarm and rushed over

bravely to arrest them. The robbers fired a shot to resist arrest, and the police officers returned fire, resulting in

one robber being hit and captured.

The remaining two robbers managed to escape. The injured robber was transported by ambulance to the police hospital for treatment.

### Subtenant Profiteers and Loses Big - Sentenced for Assaulting Tenant

Sues Tenant for Eviction Pending Judgment

Lin Peiqing, a subtenant at No. 180 Wuding Road, previously built a lead-roofed room on the sun deck and rented it to the Xie Guorong and Xie Qian couple for 5 yuan per month. Lin then planned to sublet the entire house, but needed to evict the tenants. The Xie Guorong couple refused to move because they had nowhere to go. On August 25, Lin brought craftsmen to remove a part of the lead roof, making it impossible for the Xie Guorong couple to live peacefully. Lin then assaulted the Xie Guorong couple, resulting in an assault case. Lin was found guilty of assault by the Criminal Division of the First Special Court and sentenced to three months of imprisonment. If he chooses to pay a fine instead of serving time, he will pay three yuan for each day of imprisonment. Lin was saddened and angered by this profiteering and loss. Recently, he filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the First Special Court, requesting that the Xie Guorong couple be ordered to evacuate. The Xie Guorong couple still opposed the evacuation. The two parties maintained their positions. Yesterday, Judge Wu Xiaoke presided over a detailed interrogation and adjourned the case for judgment.

### Lawsuit over Yong Sheng Radio Station's Transfer Fee

Both Parties Maintain Their Positions; Court Adjourns for Further Interrogation. The Yong Sheng Broadcasting Station on the 7th floor of the Wu Gong Hotel at 152 Fujian Road was founded by He Shangde, who resided at No. 523 Fuzhou Road. On August 2 of this year, it was transferred to Wang Lin for a price of 1,200 yuan and renamed Liang You Radio Station. After Wang Lin took over, although the station made money, there were still problems with the premises. He Shangde agreed to negotiate with the Wu Gong Hotel on Wang's behalf, but requested a transfer fee of 300 yuan. Wang paid He the 300 yuan transfer fee, but the problem with the premises was still unresolved. At the end of August, Wang directly negotiated with the Wu Gong Hotel, resulting in a monthly rent increase of 50 yuan and the signing of a lease agreement. Wang also paid the rent previously owed by He. Wang suffered several hundred yuan in losses. Recently, he hired lawyer Zhang Henghai to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the First Special Court, suing He Shangde and requesting that the 300 yuan transfer fee and more than 300 yuan in losses be returned. The case was heard by Judge Wu Xiaoke in the Second Civil Division a few days ago. Both parties maintained their positions, and the court adjourned the case for further interrogation.

### Western League Group A: Three Wins in Three Games; Tung Wah Fight Hard and Defeat St. Francis: 3-2 Victory; One Goal in the First Half (0-1); Dai, Liang, and Jia Score Three Goals in the Second Half, Announcing Victory

Tung Wah's soccer luck is high. In the Western League Group A match, they defeated their strong opponent St. Francis again yesterday with a score of 3-1, achieving three wins in three games. They were behind 0-1 in the first half. In the second half, Dai Linjing, Liang Shutang, and Jia Youliang each scored a goal in difficult circumstances, turning defeat into victory. It is a pity that they scored an own goal, otherwise it would have been 3-1. Li Yichen joined the front line yesterday, and Li Ning guarded the rear, but both Lis did not perform well. Could it be that they are getting old? St. Francis are all young and strong, and their running and movements are fast. Tung Wah's victory was not easy. There were 7,000 spectators yesterday, and the battle line was like a breach.

Tung Wah Team:

Qin Bigao, Li Ning, Liang Shutang, Cai Shengsen, Zhuang Youren, Han Longhai, Wu Binghao, Li Yichen, Dai Linjing, Huang Kehou, Jia Youliang

St. Francis Team:

Youxun, Bao Luoting, F Edward, Carlo, Liequge, Lin Boruocha Liao, Nuofuqie, Hu Te, Hai Erfu, Tuoxun

Fu En

Penalty Kick: First Goal Lost

Tung Wah's two tigers, Xu Wenkui and Wu Qixiang, suddenly went to Hong Kong together the day before yesterday (Saturday) to play for Eastern. Fortunately, Li Yichen returned to his parent team yesterday to play. Tung Wah's front line was missing Xu Wenkui, but the cooperation was still very tacit. However, it was not smooth in the first half, which made Tung Wah's offense difficult to enter. Tung Wah kicked off and the offense was very sharp. After 12 minutes of stalemate, the St. Francis team launched a fierce attack, approaching the penalty area directly. Li Ning was eager to repel the enemy and lost his judgment slightly, causing him to commit a foul when competing for the ball with O'Chada, and was penalized a penalty kick. Fu En scored with one stroke, and Tung Wah lost a city first. The team's morale was greatly frustrated. Although Tung Wah launched several fierce attacks, they ultimately missed good opportunities due to their eagerness to win. In the blink of an eye, 45 minutes passed, and Tung Wah was behind 0-1.

Successful Counterattack: Three Goals in a Row

The second battle began. Tung Wah's Li Yichen and Huang Kehou changed positions, and the offense gradually became sharper. After ten minutes, Cai Shengsen kicked a long ball from midfield. Ali intercepted it and passed it to Dai, who dribbled the ball straight and slammed into the heart of the goal, tying the score at one each. Eight minutes later, Liang Shutang shot from outside the three-yard line, flying straight to the right corner. Youxun and Nuofu were unprepared, and the ball flew into the net. 2-1, Tung Wah came from behind. The audience cheered. Unexpectedly, the cheers had just subsided when tragedy struck again. When St. Francis fought on the left and launched a fierce attack on Tung Wah's formation, Cai committed a foul at the 20-yard mark and was penalized a free kick. Ge Linbao kicked it out, and the five forwards advanced together. Liang Shutang and Cai tried to rescue together. Shutang passed it back to Biga, but accidentally used too much force, and the ball flew out like an arrow, directly into the net, resulting in an own goal. Only five minutes had passed since Shutang's goal. After each team scored two goals, Tung Wah's counterattack became even more urgent. St. Francis's position was alarmed from time to time. Jia Youliang finally showed his marksmanship from 20 yards out at the 40th minute. Youxun and Nuofu were at a loss, watching Tung Wah lead again with a score of 3-2. In the next five minutes, the atmosphere on the field was quite uneasy. The whistle blew for a long time, and Tung Wah defeated St. Francis with a score of 3-2.

All the soldiers in the camp participated, so there were more than 100 participants in the 100-yard race, divided into 15 groups for the preliminaries. The most exciting event was the tug-of-war final, where the two sides competed fiercely. In the final performance match, the temporary organized referee team and the Lone Army basketball and volleyball team performed, resulting in one win and one loss. In addition, there were also boxing, gymnastics, and other performances by the soldiers in the camp, as well as Zhou Ruquan's high jump and other performances. It did not end until late evening.

### Analysis of the Rush to Buy New Shares of Foreign Merchants

— Kang Sha

A Peculiarity of the Adventurer's Paradise

While the situation in the Far East is tense, the peace of the Pacific is uncertain, and Britain is scrambling to evacuate overseas Chinese, the foreign entrepreneurs in Shanghai are still in a leisurely mood, repeatedly raising new shares. And the general Chinese property owners and speculators are also cheerfully and vigorously supporting them. It is truly a peculiarity of the adventurer's paradise!

Due to the current abundance of floating capital with nowhere to go, those with funds in hand, learning from the lessons of the past year, feel that goods are either too expensive, buying foreign exchange is too risky due to the rapidly changing situation, putting money in the bank offers too little interest, and buying existing foreign shares is too expensive as their market prices often exceed the face value many times over. So, the clever Jews take advantage of this opportunity to raise the value of private enterprises, reorganize them into public companies, and issue new shares, engaging in absorbing Chinese capital to achieve their goal of escaping. The general public, relying on hearsay and clinging to the traditional mentality of worshiping foreigners, rush to fall into their trap, fearing they will be left behind. It is both laughable and pitiable.

Conditions Constituting a Trap

The key to the success of public offerings of foreign shares in Shanghai is:

First, the ability to manipulate the market of the Stock Exchange. Only the leaders in this field have this power, as if it were a monopoly, and others dare not compete with them. In their advertisements for raising new shares, the most eye-catching phrase must be "The company's shares have been formally approved by the Stock Exchange," to attract people's attention. Only if the shares can be approved by the Stock Exchange, only if the subscribers can control the market of the Stock Exchange, can the market price of the new shares not be lower than the issue price during the initial approval period. On the contrary, it can only rise, thus making people boldly buy.

Second, the offer should be made when money is easy and the stock market is strong. Because there are plenty of funds in the market, interest rates will inevitably fall, which is most likely to stimulate the activity of investors and speculators. And a strong stock market is especially likely to make everyone rush to subscribe. The latter can be created by artificial means. Therefore, in the week before and after the issuance of new shares, no matter how bad the environment, the stock market will generally be stable. If the environment is not bad, as long as a few stocks that the market considers barometers are forcibly raised sharply, there is no need to worry that the rest of the stocks will not be followed by blind people. Once the bubble is blown, people do not understand the truth, thinking that the trend of rising foreign shares will reappear, so they choose cheaper ones and buy as much as possible. Thus, new shares can be slowly released at a relatively high price. When they have sold all their shares, they no longer care about the market. Perhaps the situation is different. But we might as well talk about it. For example, the market price of Shanghai Enterprise Company shares, during the period when they were first issued in early spring of this year, rose from the issue price of 5.45 yuan (including 0.20 yuan interest) to over 8 yuan. Later, after a considerable period of time, there was no one to maintain it, and the market price was only 3 yuan at the lowest. Even recently, it is still below the issue price at that time. If people recognize its actual value, which is indeed above the public offering price at that time, then why not buy it calmly at this time, as much as you want, instead of scrambling for it like a pack of dogs fighting for bones to subscribe for other new shares, or raising the price to buy other new shares?

The Inside Story of a Fancy Pillow

Many foreign enterprises have good management, the hosts are willing to work hard for development, and are always willing to think about the interests of shareholders, which is indeed worthy of praise. But it cannot be generalized. The shares of Chinese business companies, with a face value of ten taels, are only exchanged for new shares with a face value of five jiao. The shares of ordinary companies are worthless, and the shares of the United Film Theatre Company, which were publicly offered and bought at a high price several years ago, are still unknown.

In this week, the shares of Jardine Brewery Company are being offered on the market. It is said that the enthusiasm for subscription is more astonishing than the Enterprise and Xinyi shares that were offered in the past this year. This is partly due to the particularly easy money market at present, and partly due to the high expectations of the people in charge of the company. It is appropriate to win the public's trust and welcome. Of course, this cannot be compared with the nonsense mentioned above. But we might as well make a considerable discussion based on the facts.

According to the advertisement for Jardine Brewery Company's new shares, we know that this was originally a private enterprise, founded in 1924. It was not until recently (October 11) that it was reorganized into a public company in accordance with the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance. The authorized capital is 2 million shares, each with a face value of 5 yuan in national currency. 1.4 million shares are issued first, which are purchased by the original partners Kai Ziwei (accounting for one-third of all shares) and Haiyi and Harrison of Liang'an Foreign Company (accounting for one-third of all shares) for 7 million yuan. Then Liang'an Foreign Company will take out 800,000 shares from this and sell them at a price of 6 yuan per share in national currency. Except for 300,000 shares, which have been fully subscribed, the remaining 500,000 shares will be publicly offered from 10:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. on October 24. According to the report of Kezuoshi Accountants, which was commissioned by the company to audit the accounts, the operating conditions in the most recent three years are: a loss of 398,000 yuan in 1937, a loss of 254,000 yuan in 1938, and a profit of 194,000 yuan in 1939. In the first half of this year, there was a profit of 618,000 yuan, but the foreign exchange losses on fixed orders amounted to 275,000 yuan, which has not been amortized (currently reduced to 128,000 yuan). At the end of last year, the value of buildings, machinery and equipment was increased to 1,842,000 yuan based on the foreign currency expenditure in that year, converted into legal tender according to the black market price at that time. As for the operating performance from 1934 to 1936, although the report does not mention it, we can easily infer it based on the fact that Shanghai Brewery Company has never paid dividends since 1934. Based on the above situation, the face value is priced at 5 yuan, but it has actually been increased. Now, adding 20 percent to the face value and selling it at a price of 6 yuan, is it cheap? Is it worthwhile? Everyone might as well weigh it carefully.

Furthermore, regarding the Xinyi Yarn Factory shares issued last month, according to the audit report of the factory's commission of Kezuoshi accountants, it is proven that since the initial payment of capital, 100,000 new shares have been issued, totaling 2 million yuan. Thus, the actual average value of each share is at most 7 yuan. But at present, because it has not been issued for long, and there are rumors of issuing new shares at 7.5 yuan, the market price is being held up and can hover around 8 yuan. In today's situation where yarn factories are reducing production and the recession is deepening, this situation also provides much food for thought for investors.

In short, even if floating capital is rampant, it can be well utilized for purposes that benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. Do not be a tool for others, resulting in harming others and yourself. What is the point?

### On Gold Futures

— Hu Luofu

On the 19th of this month, a squeezing panic occurred in the black market. The price of gold and the exchange rate deviated from their usual parallel trend. The US exchange rate went up by 0.03125, and the price of gold rose by 115 yuan, reaching nearly 5,900 yuan at its highest. It was heard that the colleagues decided after the market closed that all unclosed long positions must be valued at the closing price of the US exchange rate on that day, totaling 5,990 yuan, which was 160 yuan higher than the closing price of the black market on that day. The short positions expressed objections to this, so the market was suspended for several days to negotiate a settlement. At the same time, the black market was prone to panics due to insufficient chips, so after resuming business on the 24th, it began to trade futures, with a half-month period. The first period was set to be delivered on the afternoon of November 14. The market believes that trading futures can avoid the problem of insufficient chips and further promote the speculative nature of gold. However, this method is entirely focused on speculative business, without considering the meaning of the market and its possible dangers. The harm it causes to society is by no means small.

The Significance of the Gold Market in the Past

Before the currency reform in our country, Shanghai had a gold exchange because at that time all countries in the world had adopted the gold standard, while we still used the silver standard. The ratio of gold to silver changed from time to time, which had a great impact on the country's trade. The establishment of the gold exchange was to avoid the losses suffered by traders due to changes in the ratio of gold to silver, and to protect their legitimate interests. For example, if Party A orders goods from the United States, which will only arrive in Shanghai for delivery and payment one month later, in order to avoid the losses suffered due to silver price changes during this month, Party A can purchase the same amount of gold futures for the next month from the gold exchange. After the goods arrive, on the one hand, they will settle the exchange and pay off, and on the other hand, they will resell the gold. In this way, they can avoid the unpredictable changes in gold and silver prices, and save the interest burden of purchasing spot foreign exchange. The contribution to trade and finance is extremely great. Although there are still speculative merchants using the gold exchange as a place for speculation, its meaning is by no means diminished.

After the currency reform in 1935, China's currency system changed from the silver standard to the de facto gold exchange standard. Each yuan of legal tender was set at one shilling and two and a half pence against the British pound. The national bank bought and sold foreign exchange without limitation to maintain this price. As a result, the exchange rate was stable, and the changes in the ratio of gold to silver were only enough to increase or decrease the silver balance tax, which had no impact on the exchange rate. Therefore, the existence of the gold exchange has also lost its meaning, and the government has clearly ordered it to stop its business in order to meet its original purpose.

Black Market Transactions from Spot to Futures

After the government took control of foreign exchange and implemented the application and approval system in March 1938, a black market occurred in Shanghai because the authority was not strong enough. As the black market exchange rate gradually tightened, the price of gold continued to rise sharply. The employees of the old gold exchange and several silver shops thought that the drastic changes in the price of gold were a very good target for speculation, so they organized the black market to buy and sell spot gold, and charged handling fees from China. This kind of market had no meaning to speak of, but the purchase and sale of black market foreign exchange was unlimited, and investing in gold was also very natural. The emergence of this kind of market was an inevitable result. However, since the gold market has been produced, and the price changes drastically, speculation is inevitable.

However, in the past, the black market only allowed spot transactions. Long speculators had to bear interest, while foreign exchange, in addition to spot, also had futures. Whenever the exchange rate shrank sharply and interest rates soared, large speculators scrambled to buy spot foreign exchange, and the demand was very strong. Small households were limited by their capital and speculated in gold, and the demand was not as much as foreign exchange. In addition, the government ordered the free export of gold to be prohibited, so the degree of gold price rise was often not as high as that of foreign exchange. According to the exchange rate settlement, it often pressed down on 300 or 400 yuan, and it once reached as much as 700 yuan when the shrinking trend was fierce. However, the recent economic situation has completely changed. Shanghai is full of floating capital, and interest rates have fallen. Buying spot gold is no longer a major burden. In addition, the international situation is turbulent and uncertain, and all countries are in danger of being involved in the war vortex. Foreign exchange is also unreliable. In order to ensure their property, the wealthy are willing to bear interest and hoard spot gold as a means of storage. As a result, the market's chips are exhausted, and the pressing price is gradually shrinking; the long positions think that there is an opportunity to take advantage of, and secretly contact each other to force delivery of spot goods. The short positions have no way to make up for it, so they have to settle at a high price. As a result, the price of gold flies up against foreign exchange. According to the closing exchange rate of the black market on the 19th, the equivalent is ... 160 yuan higher than the exchange rate. According to the colleagues' decision, there is no sky!

According to general speculation, there are less than 500 gold chips circulating on the market recently, while the cumulative transaction volume often reaches 2,000 or 3,000. In this era of prevalent hoarding, the occurrence of a squeezing panic is also extremely natural. The black market thinks that changing to futures can avoid the shortage of chips and prevent the recurrence of squeezing panics, but in theory, it is a big mistake.

The objects of speculation must have the conditions of ample chips and unlimited supply. Now the international situation seems to be Ning Jing, and the future development is unpredictable. The trend of hoarding gold is still at its peak. The shortage of chips will inevitably be more profound. Since this weakness has been exposed, gold has actually lost its qualification as an object of speculation. After changing to futures, it is not only impossible to solve the shortage of chips, but also makes the possibility of squeezing even more obvious due to the increase in the volume of transactions. When the cotton yarn panic occurred in 1937, there was not as much floating capital as there is now, the trend of speculation was not as strong as it is now, and the cotton yarn chips were extremely abundant, which is not comparable to the current gold. However, it still inevitably caused a squeezing panic and could not be resolved. Therefore, after the black market futures are opened, the occurrence of disturbances can be predicted. Moreover, the current black market is not a formal exchange, the organization is extremely loose, and there is no supervisory agency. The Zhuang not only collect handling fees, but also engage in self-operated speculation. If a panic occurs one day, the Zhuang will not be able to bear it, then the market will collapse, and the margin of the general speculators will also be lost. If speculators understand this dangerous situation, they should be keenly aware of the danger of gold speculation!

Furthermore, in terms of the significance of gold futures, now that legal tender has been separated from the silver standard, the ratio of gold to silver has no impact on the exchange rate. In order to prevent losses due to black market exchange rate fluctuations, traders can buy and sell foreign exchange futures to ensure their legitimate interests. There is no need to purchase gold futures. In fact, since gold is prohibited from export, it cannot be used as a means of payment to foreign countries, and it has nothing to do with trade. Therefore, the current gold futures are completely different from the gold exchange era. There is no trade and financial significance. It is only a means for the Zhuang to temporarily solve the chip problem and increase the handling fee income. In the past, various exchanges were speculative institutions, but they still had important functions for the country and society. Now the black market is only a profit-making institution for the Zhuang, without any meaning to speak of. It only causes speculation and promotes disturbances. The harm it causes is no different from the Shanghai West gambling den. Do the speculators want to compare themselves to gamblers?

Where to go?

Recently, the international situation has been changing, and the rich in Shanghai are at a loss.

If a conflict occurs between the United States and Japan, foreign exchange control and the blockade of Chinese capital in the occupied areas may be inevitable. The unreliability of foreign exchange is obvious. This gold squeezing panic proves that most wealthy people have turned to hoarding gold. However, the difference between gold and foreign exchange is only 50% and 100%, which is by no means a good strategy to maintain property. If Shanghai loses its internationality and is completely controlled by one side's force, then it will not be difficult to set a price and search for gold. Those who hoard gold will inevitably suffer the death penalty if they hide it and do not report it. If they respond to the purchase at the set price, they can only obtain violent currency, and the future is difficult to predict. Now the domestic economic construction has just begun, and there is a need for positive funding. If Shanghai's floating capital can take the opportunity to move inland, it can not only benefit the national economy, but also ensure its own property. There is great benefit. I hope that investors will not hesitate to move forward and bring disaster to themselves!

### Barter Trade and Shanghai Trade

— Zhang Mingxiang

International barter agreements have never been popular. However, the number and scope of such agreements, and the countries adopting them, are gradually increasing. In the past twelve months, Britain has not only implemented barter within its empire but has also concluded a large number of barter contracts with the United States, a quantity rarely seen in modern trade history. It is undoubtedly the case that international trade under the most-favored-nation treaty system is in line with economic principles and financial theories for the entire world. However, this system has overturned many international trade imbalances, and the various methods previously used to balance international payments have become obsolete. Therefore, there is no other option now but to resort to barter, unless trade is completely halted. After all, barter trade is better than no trade at all.

Shanghai's trade imbalance was quite severe during peacetime. However, this massive trade deficit did not affect the prosperity of the city. This is because the trade surplus of other parts of China and the international payments required to be made to China for non-trade items were used to offset Shanghai's large trade deficit. However, this mechanism has changed due to the Sino-Japanese War. In the past three years, the large trade deficit has been a heavy burden on Shanghai, mainly due to the continuous depreciation of the Chinese legal tender, thus posing a serious threat to future trade between Shanghai and the outside world.

We are now in the export season, which, judging from the city's trade balance, is the best time of the year. However, the commercial balance remains in an unfavorable position. Calculated in US dollars, Shanghai's imports in June this year were worth US$18,300,000, while Shanghai's exports were only US$7,000,000, resulting in a trade deficit of US$10,600,000. However, this is based on the figures listed in the Chinese Customs trade statistics, which tend to overestimate imports and underestimate exports. Some of the imports from areas under Japanese influence are naturally not subject to exchange obligations, while exports to Japan do not yield foreign exchange. A more accurate and conservative estimate is that the trade deficit for June was roughly US$8,000,000—still a substantial amount. Part of this huge trade deficit is covered by forward transactions, and another part is compensated by funds transferred back from Hong Kong.

Currently, Shanghai's importers do not pay much attention to forward positions, the flow of funds from Hong Kong to Shanghai is about to end, and the flight of capital from Shanghai is about to resume. It is extremely difficult to hope for improvement in the city's trade balance in the coming months. And imports after the autumn will inevitably increase greatly. In the coming winter, a very large trade deficit will be created. This trade imbalance will have a serious impact on the city's legal tender. Shanghai is isolated from other parts of China and assistance from the outside world is not easy to obtain, so the city's business community will be entirely dependent on itself. Therefore, under these circumstances, Shanghai certainly cannot continue to import goods at one to three times the value of exports. Therefore, the trade deficit must be reduced, but the so-called reduction of the trade deficit is to encourage exports, not to forcibly reduce imports.

However, Shanghai must rely on itself. Fortunately, several trade items in Shanghai, if barter agreements are concluded, are conducive to Shanghai's export trade, and are mostly concentrated in a few larger firms and trade associations. Large imports of cotton and rice can be used as a method to expand Shanghai's export market. These imports account for more than 40% of the city's total imports, and these imports are also extremely important to the countries that supply us with cotton, rice, wheat, and flour. So why not ask these countries that sell us large quantities of goods to expand the overseas market for Shanghai products? This request seems to be very sensible and should be directed at countries that have adopted trade and foreign exchange controls, causing artificial barriers to Shanghai's export trade, since Shanghai is now facing the same obstacles.

If the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce or other reputable commercial organizations in the city take the lead and quickly contact Shanghai's importers of cotton, rice, wheat, and flour, then it will surely succeed. Because Shanghai's importers can tell their foreign suppliers that in order to maintain past large purchases, their foreign suppliers should find ways to induce their respective governments to understand the reason for selling large quantities of goods to Shanghai and give special treatment. Even if a barter agreement is not actually concluded, countries that export large quantities to Shanghai can be induced to grant Shanghai reciprocal treatment. If so, the city's business community will benefit from it. If this reciprocal treatment is rejected, then Shanghai can begin to demand direct barter agreements to prevent large purchases of raw materials and food while Shanghai's exports are extremely limited. If this request also fails, then the city's business community can only unanimously turn to other favorable avenues. It is of course impossible to expect Shanghai's foreign suppliers to allow us a new market in their country, but they can help us compensate elsewhere. Therefore, there is the possibility of establishing triangular barter agreements. For example, if Australia wants to buy goods from Shanghai, it is of course impossible for Shanghai to buy wheat and flour from it; however, Australia can help us get a new market in other countries, as long as these countries have a trade deficit with Australia; or other countries in the gold pound group can give us some commercial assistance.

There are many difficulties in making this happen. However, Shanghai's business community needs to consider this issue in order to obtain compensation overseas in preparation for continuing large trade deficits. (Original author John Ahlers)

Commercial News

### Shanghai Woolen Fabric Dominates

Shanghai-made woolen fabrics have been selling very well recently and can be said to be the most dominant in the current woolen fabric market. Because imported goods are scarce, the cost is related to foreign exchange, and the selling price is high, the purchasing power of all sectors continues to weaken. Therefore, they choose the lesser of two evils and consider Shanghai-made products priced at just over ten yuan and just over twenty yuan per yard to be relatively popular and qualified. Because store owners find that they sell quickly, they are trying harder to promote them in order to cater to the needs of their customers, resulting in considerable retail and wholesale transactions of Shanghai-made woolen fabrics. Of those who congratulate woolen fabric stores, large and small, and brokers on making transactions, six or seven out of ten are selling Shanghai-made woolen fabrics. The market is in good condition, and many new products are being created by the factories. It is reported that among the Shanghai-made woolen fabrics currently selling well, the better-selling ones include those from Jardine Matheson (British), Yongxing (Japanese), Gongda, Yin Feng (Chinese), Xiexin, Zhanghua, Daye, Meilun, Dalong, Great Shanghai, Hualun, Weiyi, Runfeng, etc.

### Charcoal Demolition Price Increases

Charcoal for hand warmers has been out of stock for a long time due to the discontinuation of raw charcoal powder. Even this type of raft charcoal powder is intermittent and difficult to sustain. In addition, labor costs are now extremely high, making charcoal making unprofitable, so most have stopped work. However, the street is selling more because of the cool autumn and early winter, and the market is turning active. Under these circumstances, demolition prices have naturally increased. Yesterday, large stores opened at 3 yuan per thousand pieces, and second-grade stores at 19 yuan. Retail at the door is 3.5 cents per piece.

### Bituminous Coal Price Rises Slightly

Bituminous coal, affected by the white coal turmoil, has risen slightly with the rising tide. However, actual sales are sluggish, with only factories on the street slightly decorating. Out-of-town customers are still limited. The Si Jiating bituminous coal that a certain foreign company used to make is now priced at 172 yuan per ton in the black market, Baoli lump coal at 168 yuan, and coal powder at 136 yuan, all higher than last week.

### Cement Price Hike Resumes

Cement prices have risen sharply again due to shortages from various sources and the relentless procurement by construction crews on the street. Among them, the most prominent is the Horse Brand cement, which is now selling for 70 yuan per barrel. Those who want to buy more must raise the price. White cement is selling for 96 yuan per barrel, Japanese Dragon Brand and Taishan Brand paper bags are quoted at 17.5 yuan, and H-Mark and M-Mark paper bags are priced at 11 yuan each.

### Ship Steel Plate Sales Active

Ship steel plates have been selling particularly actively to shipyards in the street recently. The most sought after are thicker plates of 1/8 and 1/4 inch. Thinner plates, such as 1/10 and 1/5 inch, are also occasionally sought by factories and machine shops. Prices are also better than before. Currently, 1/10 inch is selling for 90 yuan per picul, 1/5 inch is selling for 70 yuan, 7/10 inch is selling for 65 yuan, and 1/8 inch also requires 70 yuan. It is estimated that about 200 to 300 piculs were traded the day before yesterday.

### Statistics on Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Activities in August

Dehui

This survey of changes in Shanghai's industry in August shows a total of 166 companies, one more than the 165 in July. Here, I will briefly describe the nature of these changes, classified as follows: New Openings: The number of new openings in August was 14, all of which were commercial establishments, a decrease of three compared to the 17 new openings in July. It is clear to everyone that since May, Shanghai's industry has gradually entered a state of decline, with inventories accumulating, a lack of outlets, and prices falling due to supply exceeding demand. The abnormal development of industry over the past two years has disappeared like a spring dream. Therefore, under such circumstances, the opening of new factories has made investors hesitant. Furthermore, among the 14 new commercial establishments, the food and beverage industry ranked first with five establishments, with the Meihua Restaurant being the largest in scale, giving pleasure-seekers another place to go. Following this were financial institutions. In the pathological Shanghai financial market, banks are undoubtedly the most prosperous. It can also be said that this is the abnormal outlet after the flooding of speculative capital in the Shanghai market. One new company was established, Qihua Iron Factory Co., Ltd., which is the same as in July.

Reopening: One company reopened, China Civil Engineering Company at 507 Edward Road, also the same as in July.

Liquidation and Closure: In August, there were a total of 19 industrial and commercial factories and stores in liquidation and closure, including three factories and sixteen stores, a decrease of seven compared to the sixteen in July. Among them, the larger ones were the voluntary dissolution of Yiyi Company and Nanyi Company. It is reported that these two companies were operating foreign film theaters and had a considerable history in Shanghai. Following this were Huarong Silver Company, Maoye Rubber Products Factory, and several others.

### Share Transfer: The number of industrial

and commercial factories and stores that transferred shares in August was 22, including three factories and nineteen stores, a decrease of five compared to the seventeen in July. Among them, the larger ones were Huaguang Nail Factory, Dafeng Leather Factory, Shenzhou Foreign Company, Zhihong Exchange, Rongde Money Shop, Lao Fengxiang Yuji Silver Shop, Wu Kang Pharmacy, and seven others. In terms of industry, there were thirteen companies in (food and beverage, clothing, dyeing and weaving, finance, metal, electrical, and medicine).

### Transfer of Operations: The number of industrial

and commercial factories and stores that transferred operations in August was 109, including twenty factories and eighty-nine stores, an increase of sixteen compared to the ninety-three in July. The transfer of operations of industrial and commercial companies can also be said to be the closure of the previous stage, but the difference from closure is that there is someone immediately taking over the operations in the next stage. Therefore, the increase in the transfer of operations reflects the sluggishness of the Shanghai market, which should not be denied by anyone. Among the 109 companies that transferred operations, the larger ones were Daxin Iron Factory, Guanhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Daming Electrical Appliances Industry, Wu Fu Weaving Factory, Sheng Bolai Electrical Appliances Factory, Hexing Yarn Shop, Lianggong Power, Printing Factory, Nan Quan Restaurant, Zhao Rong Cotton Cloth Shop, Jinyuan Paper Warehouse, and Huali Dyeing and Weaving Factory, etc. (To be continued)

### Proper Posture Enhances Clothing Beauty

— Yun

Although clothing is extremely important for appearance, body posture is the basis for improving appearance. Many people wear extremely beautiful and fashionable clothes, but because they do not have good posture, they still cannot create a good impression.

Here are a few exercises that can make your posture meet the proper conditions. Readers may wish to try them.

(1) Start with the simplest exercise: take a deep breath, puff out your chest, and roll your shoulders back.

(2) Stand straight, inhale, lift your heels, then exhale and return to the original position. This exercise can be done several times, even when sitting.

(3) To correct the curvature of the back, lie flat on the bed, then lift your legs, lower them, and repeat this several times. This is very effective.

(4) If you want to practice proper walking posture, you can first lean your back against a wall, breathe, then walk forward five steps, then turn around and walk backward. Sometimes you can walk with a book on your head. This can make your walking posture more natural and graceful. When walking, you should keep your head straight and look forward.

After you have carried out the above exercises, you will never have bad posture again. Coupled with the latest fashion, your appearance can be called perfect.

### The Personality of Colors

— Fangfei

Every woman, at some point, will be influenced by colors. Sometimes you will say, "I don't feel very happy wearing this dress today, so I'll change to another one." Or you might say, "I don't feel very well today, so I don't want to wear dark blue clothes. I'd rather wear something yellow." Although these are very simple words, there is actually truth in them.

Modern science has already placed a branch of color in psychology because color has a great influence on life. Under normal circumstances, many people like red, second to blue, then green, yellow, purple, and white. Each color has a great relationship with human emotions.

Dramatists also consider color to be very important. Therefore, when they are designing costumes for actors, they spend a lot of thought to ensure that the color of the clothes can produce the expected impact on the psychology and emotions of the audience. A young female hero often wears white clothes, a romantic woman often wears dark red clothes, and a suspect in a murder case often wears black clothes.

Modern, discerning women generally know that dark red is too bright and dazzling. If they like red, it is better to choose colors such as rose red or purplish red.

Each color has its own unique personality. We may as well list them below:

Red symbolizes love and generosity. It is a lively color with the meaning of health and truth. According to years of research by psychologists, women mostly like red, while men mostly like blue.

Blue symbolizes thought and hope. When it is combined with green, it becomes the color of turquoise. Many intelligent and modern women like this color.

Green represents outdoor scenery and the meaning of spring. Yellow represents light and joy. For example, if we put a pot of yellow flowers in a dark room, it will immediately produce a pleasant feeling.

The realm of yellow includes many shades of deep and light colors, and the realm of green includes apple green and olive green.

Brown is not an independent color, but rather a mixed color, because brown often includes red or yellow.

Purple symbolizes the soul and has the highest ideals. It belongs to religion, and it is most suitable for older people to wear purple clothes.

Although white seems simple on the surface, it actually includes seven colors, which are the mixture of violet, dark blue, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. Therefore, white can produce various emotions and become the most complete and beautiful color. This may be the reason why brides' dresses are white.

Black was originally a terrifying color with a bad impression, but modern fashion believes that black is beautiful. Among many women, a woman wearing black clothes will show her outstanding temperament.

Colors can also be divided into cold and warm colors. When choosing your clothing material, you should first see what your personality is like. If cool colors are more suitable for me, then you can abandon warm colors.

From the above simple description, it can be explained why a certain kind of clothing is matched with a certain kind of occasion. For example, the best colors for sportswear are green, brown, and red, and the best colors for evening dresses are white, light blue, yellow, and red.

When choosing clothing materials, you only need to go through a few experiments to see which color best matches your personality, and it is also necessary to know the personality of various colors.

### Random Thoughts on Furs

— Gao Xiufu

In the past, before plant fibers and silk cocoons were utilized, animal skins were the only gifts that primitive people used to cover their bodies and keep warm. Later, thanks to the invention of leather tanning, making clothes out of fur became a necessity for keeping warm and was universally worn. It is said that leather tanning and leather making were invented by Bigan of the Shang Dynasty. On the 13th day of July every year, a group of leather goods workers and furriers would bow down to him, just as carpenters piously worship Master Luban and tailors pay homage to the Yellow Emperor, with the same meaning.

The clothing hierarchy in the Qing Dynasty was very strict. The ranks of commoners and officials could be seen at a glance from their clothing. Furs were also worn according to the size of the official rank. According to the Qing system, only princes and dukes were allowed to use thousand-year-old black fox fur. Marquises and first-rank officials could wear sable. It was truly an extraordinary and glorious honor for meritorious officials to receive a sable jacket bestowed by the emperor. Now, there are no restrictions on clothing. Black foxes are successfully raised and produced in large quantities, so elegant and luxurious black fox short coats, shawls, and collars can be tailored and worn at will by scholars and gentlemen.

Our country is truly rich in resources, and animal furs are found everywhere. There are Shaanxi lynx sheepskin, Taohe fox fur, Tibetan otter skin, Yunnan leopard skin, Sichuan rabbit skin, Zhejiang marmot squirrel skin, Anhui roe deer skin, and especially abundant animal skins outside the customs. The annual export value of our country's sheepskin, yellow wolf skin, and marmot skin reaches tens of millions of yuan.

Persian lamb is one of the most valuable furs in the world. Recently, Romania ceded Bessarabia Province to the Soviet Union, which also produces famous breeds of sheepskin. Western ladies often use these two types of sheepskin to make form-fitting coats, and they are very proud of them.

I remember that when Albania was annexed by Italy, the king and queen fled in a hurry, resulting in their inability to fulfill their contract with a certain London fur company to retrieve fur clothing worth £50,000. The company once sued the former king and queen. Now that London is always shrouded in the atmosphere of bombing, and people generally spend their days and nights in air-raid shelters, I don't know how this major case will be resolved.

Since the prevalence of woolens and the like, the Chinese people's habit of preferring the new and disliking the old has inevitably had an impact on the development of fur goods. Fortunately, foreigners have a great love for furs, so our country's exports of raw goods have increased annually, which has also made up for a lot of the losses. The world's fur industry center is in New York and London, but Paris is unique in the creation and design of fur clothing styles. The various beautiful furs of the top Hollywood stars are all supplied with designs by famous Parisian fur masters. However, now Paris is not what it used to be. It is unknown whether the famous masters are still there, designing fashions as usual.

Shanghai is a major trading port, and the clothing of ladies is changing rapidly. Since the prevalence of cheongsams, fashionable ladies must have coats and jackets. It is elegant and Europeanized to wear them in the morning. In winter, fur coats are also indispensable. As for the turned-down large collar, long narrow sleeves, and box-style (Box Style), these are the most popular styles currently. The reason why fur coats adopt the small public net style or the collarless style is very simple: because there are whole black fox, red fox, black sword fox, blue-gray fox, sable, or snow ferret, etc., which are made into figurative neck wraps. Fur hand muffs can replace handbags, so the sleeves of fur coats do not have to be too narrow. The concentration of the fur industry in this city is in the Henan Road area, while Western-style women's clothing fur shops are located on Sichuan Road north of Nanjing Road, and in recent years, between Seymour Road and Gego Road on Jing'an Temple Road. There are also several shops on Xiafei Road. As for Chen Changji Fur Shop at the corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road, it is said that it created Western-style women's fur coats as early as the Guangxu period, and it has long been famous overseas.

### Hollywood Fashion Report

— Luo

Greer Garson: She recently invented a new type of handkerchief, where one corner is embroidered with flowers and the other corner is embroidered with the initials of her name. Other stars have seen it and consider it very novel.

Bette Davis: She has a blue wool sweater. She sews the buttons on the front, and she also made a light blue small hat.

Maureen O'Hara bases her clothing for the fall and winter of 1940 on a simple principle of tailoring. Recently, she made a blue wool outfit, which can be said to be a representative work of her ideal becoming a reality.

Ribbons are still very popular in Hollywood. Since Ginger Rogers used ribbons in the film "Flying Down to Rio", many people have followed suit. Marlene Dietrich made a hat entirely of ribbons, and Merle Oberon even made a dress out of ribbons.

Hollywood's famous fashion designer, Travis Banton, says that every woman eventually has a color that excites her. For Ann Sheridan, the color that makes her happiest is green. When she wears green clothes, she feels very happy in her spirit. Among all the greens, her favorite is emerald green.

"In the rainy season, a woman can fully express her personal beauty," this is the creed held by Patricia Lane, and she has also put it into practice. She wears a blue rain hat that matches her eyes, and she wears a red raincoat that can harmonize with the color of her lips.

Speaking of the rainy season, Jean Arthur is also very knowledgeable. She has a black umbrella, but it is not the kind that her grandfather used to have. Her umbrella is transparent and has a red handle, so it is very beautiful.

### Advice from an Expert

A fashion expert once gave the following advice to women:

If you are not truly beautiful, then don't pretend to be beautiful. You might as well appear more natural. The women of Paris, France, are not truly beautiful, but they are very clever. They don't focus on their faces, but on the design of their clothing. Therefore, Paris has become the fashion center of the world. So when you are choosing clothing, it is very important to study your own personality.

Spring and Autumn

### Fashion Scene on Avenue Joffre

— Wang

The Surging Fashion Industry

What has changed the appearance of Avenue Joffre is undoubtedly the surging fashion industry this autumn. The street, which was already considered exotic by people, is now coated with a layer of gorgeous colors, making it even more moving and strongly enticing passersby, causing them to stop. The central section of Avenue Joffre, from Rue Luban in the east to Rue Pére Robert in the west, is full of magnificent facades, exquisite shop windows, and pleasing signs. This is the new face of Avenue Joffre created by the emerging fashion companies. The location of fashion stores is the same as that of Western clothing stores, with a certain place representing a certain class. The ones that have sprung up on Avenue Joffre have already established their new position, looking down on others.

Origin and Evolution of Fashion Stores

So-called fashion naturally refers to clothing that is in line with the times. The earliest fashion businesses in our country catered not to Chinese people but to foreigners. The clothing made at that time was mostly women's evening gowns and men's and women's formal wear for weddings. Later, they began to refer to foreign women's clothing styles and made women's coats to meet the needs of the world. Modern women followed suit, and it has been popular ever since. No one cares about old-fashioned cloaks and capes anymore. However, the scope of Chinese fashion is very narrow. It is still limited to several types such as coats and short jackets, unlike foreign fashion, which includes various formal dresses, casual wear for home, casual wear for going out, sportswear, hunting attire, riding attire, nightgowns, etc. This issue is related to the standard of living and living habits, so we cannot be too critical of the lack of development in our country's fashion industry. At present, the business scope of the fashion industry still focuses on women's coats and short jackets, and occasionally makes cheongsams and Chinese-style dresses. Several also rent out formal wear.

Movies and Fashion

The costumes worn by the protagonists Chen Juanjuan and Lu Luming in the Xinhua film "Bluebird," which will be released soon, are designed by specialized technicians and made by the Guotai Fashion Company. The styles and color schemes have reached the peak of beauty. It is said that the Xinhua authorities are very satisfied, and they plan to continue to cooperate with the Guotai Company in the future. The new short jacket of Chen Yunshang, a pillar star of Xinhua, was also made by the Guotai Company. It is extremely novel and beautiful. When worn by the graceful Chen Yunshang, it feels even more charming.

Suggestions for the Fashion Industry

Abroad, there are really all kinds of promotional methods, and there is nothing that is not strange, but in summary, it is nothing more than the two words "promotion." Our country's fashion industry has less capital, and large-scale promotions such as fashion shows and fashion exhibitions are not easy to implement, but it is possible to individually hire models to perform fashion poses in the company and invite customers to visit. This move may attract the attention of Shanghai women. In addition, window design is also extremely important. I have seen many windows, displayed so full that they only make people dizzy and unable to grasp the essentials. It is advisable to display a latest and most fashionable outfit in the window in a graceful pose, decorated with flowers. As for the style of fashion, we do not necessarily have to imitate Paris and Hollywood, or aspire to reach their level. Chinese women need comfortable and practical new clothes, you might as well work hard in this direction.

### Miss Whigreen, Fashion Designer of the Film "Bluebird," Talks About Women's Clothing

Miss Whigreen is a fashion designer at Twentieth Century Fox Film Company. After the costume design for Shirley Temple's "Bluebird" was completed, she said to the reporter who interviewed her:

"The best interior decoration in every home is the housewife who works inside. Many women clean up everything in the house very well, but they don't pay any attention to themselves at all. This is really a mistake."

She meant that a successful marriage is closely related to the appearance of women. In order to promote a happy marriage, the clothes worn by a housewife at home are best washed, especially those worn in the morning.

Socks made of yarn are more suitable for everyday wear at home, because they are more durable and can be economical.

A wife can very well accept the advice of her husband, although they are not fashion experts and cannot contribute concrete opinions, but they often have amazing opinions on methods to promote the beauty of women's appearance.

### Fashion Briefs

Fan Yuna Fashion Company is the largest fashion company on Fourth Road. Both new and old customers are satisfied with the coats it produces. Recently, it has purchased a large batch of wool fabrics from Europe and the United States. As winter approaches, a special price reduction is being held. All women are welcome to go and choose as they please.

Women's Fashion Expert: Xindu Fashion Company opened at 586 Avenue Joffre, west of the Paris Grand Theatre. Although it has only been open for exactly one month, it is crowded every day, and it is generally recognized as a giant in the fashion industry that has come from behind.

### Madman

— Wei Wei

"Look at the madman, look at the madman!"

Someone was shouting in the alley, so people poked their heads out from different house numbers, watching with the same emotion as watching a free show.

"There, there, there!" (Read "nai")

Someone was pointing, but didn't dare to get close.

Following the finger, a person wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants was lying across the door of number ten. He would hit anyone who came near. Everyone knew that this was A'gen, the rickshaw puller from the ×× cotton clothes shop. But A'gen didn't recognize anyone, and had beaten several of the shop's gentlemen so badly that they could only run outside.

"Are you crazy, A'gen!"

The gentlemen seemed to still want to put on airs to confirm their identities, but the answer they got was a punch in the face!

The alley patrolman saw that the gentlemen were being wronged, so he rushed over in three steps. He thought that it would be no problem to scare a rickshaw puller with this tiger uniform, as the saying goes, "rotten and decayed can eat a person."

Perhaps the world had gone off track. The patrolman thought that there would be no problem and that he could ask the gentlemen for credit, but today he was rebuffed by A'gen. He couldn't stop him, and the tiger uniform was hit with several punches first, making him furious. He pulled out the gun from his waist and made a shooting stance, but the madman ignored it and continued to fight anyone who approached him. The brute strength of pulling a rickshaw was already good, and being crazy made him even stronger. This made the tiger uniform feel that "there was no place for a hero to use his skills," so he had to retreat and give the gentlemen an apologetic smile, and then stuffed the gun back into his waist.

No one dared to go up and compete with the madman anymore, and the madman also felt like he had no opponents, so he fell down. The tense scene seemed to have relaxed a lot. The people watching the free show were about to leave, but the madman began to speak. The madman's words should be "mad words."

"Earning sixty cents a day but having to eat rice that costs ninety cents a day, damn it! What kind of world is this!"

"If I were in the Public Works Department, rice would definitely be sold for one dollar per dan."

"I have to discuss this with the Public Works Department, how can the poor live?"

Two hands were waving left and right, and the saliva in his mouth was spraying out.

"One dollar per stone of rice, you go steal it!"

Someone in the crowd spoke up.

"He also deserves to discuss with the Public Works Department, he's really a madman!"

Someone who wasn't crazy pointed out that A'gen's imitation wasn't very good.

"Who says I'm crazy, you're the crazy one, was I wrong to discuss with the Public Works Department? Don't you want to eat rice that costs one dollar per stone?"

A'gen said as he stood up, his eyes shining with a frightening light, looking for someone to answer him.

"The madman is going to hit someone again!"

Seeing that the "situation" was not right, the people watching the free show began to run away. All that was left was the madman himself, who was still shouting:

"Don't you want to eat rice that costs one dollar per stone?"

### Answering Readers' Questions - For the Popular Fever

— Zhang Juying

The previous article was about the popular fever, written to inform new friends and patients. A friend forwarded it to be reviewed and published in the Shenbao. It was not originally intended to be submitted for the purpose of publicity. Now, a letter from a Shenbao reader states that there are several questions that need to be answered and disclosed. The letter does not provide a detailed mailing address, so it is impossible to reply by mail. Therefore, this article will be published in the Shenbao to answer the questions.

The previous medical history was based on Osler's Internal Medicine. According to that book, it has never been popular in Shanghai. When it was first discovered in Shanghai, Western doctors did not pay attention to it, like unpopular goods in a store. Suddenly, customers come to buy them, forgetting where the goods are placed. The more buyers there are, the more unpopular goods become popular. In early September, I consulted with a Western doctor about this disease. It was suspected but not definitively diagnosed. After blood tests and other procedures, the Western doctor diagnosed the disease. It seems that the initial situation and the situation after the outbreak are different. Now, it can be seen at a glance, without frequent blood tests. This is not to criticize Western doctors for not being able to clear up this disease.

This disease is not life-threatening, but improper treatment can prolong it or cause complications. The proper treatment is nothing more than antipyretic, damp-resolving, and diuretic, which are detailed in the article. There is no need for special magic methods or good medicine. However, there are many quack doctors in society who, regardless of the disease, whether it is mild or severe, regardless of life or death, prescribe medicine with a flick of the pen. I am not saying this to slander them. The reason why I hate quack doctors is that they are not enough to cure diseases, but they are more than enough to cause harm. This is not a personal issue, and there is no other intention.

Hawthorn Detective Case

### The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Ten: The Shoe Problem

He said in a low voice: "What are you doing here? I told you to talk to him in the downstairs reception room."

I replied: "He has already left. I talked to Jinmei and Lao Mao and discovered two important facts... I just heard you say it. Are you on the third floor?"

Hawthorn nodded and asked me back: "What two facts did you discover?"

I briefly told him about the origin of Lao Mao's leather shoes and Li Shouqi's attempt to rape Lilan. Hawthorn listened intently, nodding repeatedly, clearly acknowledging the great value of these two things.

I asked: "What are you doing on the third floor?"

He replied: "I want to collect something. But my ideal has not yet been confirmed."

I asked again: "What is your ideal?" Seeing him shake his head and not answer, I asked again: "How are your negotiations with the police going? Is there any result?"

Hawthorn shook his head and said: "No, Chief Qu released Zhao Boxiong, but promised that if I wanted to call Zhao Boxiong for questioning, he could find him."

"Then, what reason did he use to release Zhao Boxiong?"

"Chief Cui initially refused to say, only saying that he believed Zhao Boxiong was not the murderer. Later, he reluctantly told me that he was releasing him on the orders of his superior."

"Strange! The orders of his superior? What is the background of this Zhao? The chief is even being used by him?"

"The issue of his background is secondary. If he is really the murderer, no matter how great his background is, I will never let him escape the law. But I have a more important ideal in front of me - alas! Wait a minute."

Hawthorn paused. He suddenly walked to the wardrobe and pulled open the glass door. Most of the wardrobe was filled with colorful women's fashion, but there were also a few men's long coats hanging there. Hawthorn glanced into the wardrobe, and a look of disappointment appeared on his face again. I was about to ask him what he was looking for when he suddenly went around the steel bed and walked to the wall cabinet on the other side of the wall. The wall cabinet door was not locked either. After opening it, he immediately stuck his head into the cabinet. Not long after, he straightened up, turned around, and held a pair of men's leather shoes in his hand, and a mask of excitement and joy seemed to have replaced his face.

He exclaimed: "Bao, my ideal has been confirmed. Look, this is a pair of black grain leather shoes. The material and workmanship are top-notch, and they are new. They are round-toed, and the size is at least eleven inches. Hurry up and get the soft ruler." (149)
