### Japan Attempts to Sow Discord Between the Kuomintang and the Communists, Scheme Unsuccessful. Japan Changed Its Strategy Towards the Communists in an Attempt to Create a New Situation, Which Did Not Succeed.

Chongqing. After thorough inquiries by Reuters from well-informed sources, it has been learned of Japan's attempts to use the Chinese Communist Party to deal with the Nationalist government in detail. When friction occurred between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the leaders of both parties made various efforts to prevent serious consequences, and the opinions between the two parties were satisfactorily resolved. Several months ago, the strategy of the Japanese army, especially in North China, had a notable change. The Japanese army seemed to have [blanks] not take military action against the Chinese Communist army, commonly known as the Eighth Route Army. Because the Communist Party army and the Nationalist government army were both in North China [blanks] fighting, friction occurred between the two sides as a result of the sudden change in Japanese policy. The motivation of the Japanese policy was to increase the strength of the Chinese Communist army, in order to harass the Chongqing government. The Japanese hoped to create a new situation so that Chongqing would have to fight against Japan on the one hand and deal with the growing Communist Party on the other. With divided intentions, they could not deal with Japan with all their energy, but their plan did not succeed. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

### Thoughts on Children's Day

The founding of "April 4th" Children's Day has only been nine years ago. Every year on this day, celebrations are held everywhere, and there are various measures to benefit children. However, apart from a few children who participate voluntarily, most of the events held on the holiday are organized by educational institutions and cultural groups. As for the general society, it does not seem to feel a strong interest, nor has it produced any reaction. Not only that, but apart from holidays, children's movements do not seem to have been valued as much as other social movements. Given the ubiquity of children, the phenomenon of Children's Day and children's movements is as such. Unless one says it is because the history of nine years is very short, it is difficult to find a more satisfactory excuse.

Children are the masters of the future society, which is where the fundamental lifeline of the country lies. Especially at a time of transition for survival, abolition of the old, and establishment of the new, the issue of children should be considered as the top priority in national policy. China is facing such an extraordinary era, and the current generation is shouldering the sacred great cause of resisting Japan and saving the nation. However, the future work of restoration will inevitably be ten or a hundred times more arduous and complicated than today's resistance. This heavy responsibility has already been destined to fall on the next generation of citizens. Whether they can fully exert their great abilities and create new miracles in the five-thousand-year history of the Chinese nation's nation-building depends entirely on how we work hard to nurture and educate children today. The Chinese authorities have also paid considerable attention to this issue since the war began. The establishment of children's welfare homes and educational institutions throughout the country, President Chiang's repeated telegrams of appreciation to elementary school teachers across the country, and the various measures taken by the education authorities for children's education and family education are undoubtedly focused on this generation, the new force for the future revival of China. Therefore, on the occasion of celebrating Children's Day today, in addition to the various celebratory measures in form, we should also seriously consider how to coordinate children's movements with the great mission of the extraordinary period.

First, we should strive to protect the survival of children. In the nearly three years of the War of Resistance, I don't know how many innocent and lively children have been sacrificed in the cruel bombings and ruthless artillery fire. I also don't know how many vibrant children have died unjustly from suffering, and I also don't know how many happy families' children have become orphaned refugees in an instant. This kind of loss to the country and the nation will never be estimated how great it is. Naturally, some of them belong to the category that cannot be avoided or remedied, but there must also be many due to human and human shortcomings. If the evacuation and rescue work can be more effective, many casualties can be avoided. If the work of caring for refugee children can be more widespread, it will definitely save more vitality for the country. Even in the Shanghai Concession, the number of children on the starvation line is countless, and the mortality rate of infants and young children in the Municipal Council's monthly death reports is astonishingly high. We can't help but appeal to these young citizens, hoping that all parties will pay close attention to them and find ways to solve their welfare problems.

Second, we must step up the training of children's spiritual fortresses. Innocence and simplicity are the characteristics of children, and are also equivalent to a blank sheet of paper. With excellent and correct training and cultivation, they will definitely form a healthy and determined national character. If unfortunately encountered by the contamination of an evil environment, it will also delay the children's lifelong future. During the War of Resistance, the most heartbreaking scene was to make those children who could not escape from the occupied areas even more trapped and become the objects of the invaders. Every day they are instilled with enslaved consciousness, painting their white and pure souls. This is the most despicable crime above armed aggression, and all people with a sense of justice must take responsibility to find ways to save them. As for the inland areas, all those who have the responsibility of educating children should naturally take the training of national spirit as the first essential of education. This is a basic education that is more important than the instillation of all knowledge and skills.

China's new-style education has only been forty years old, and although it still has many shortcomings, in terms of the effect on the country and the nation, it has already achieved significant success. This can be understood by comparing the current War of Resistance with the Sino-Japanese War. Looking back at the education in those forty years, on the one hand, it was connected to the long dark age, and on the other hand, it had to fight against the ugly society and the unstable politics. It is natural that its own experiences have been full of hardships and it is difficult to achieve soundness, but it has already made contributions to the country and the nation, that is, the country and the nation have already gained. This shows the greatness of the educational function. Today's generation of children, born in such a turbulent era, suffer from various mental and material distress, which should be considered unfortunate. But on the other hand, what they have come into contact with is not only the lectures in the classroom and the knowledge in the textbooks, but the vivid reality and the experience of personal life. Looking at their every move, every word and deed, they are already very different from the past. What's more, the corruption and ugliness left over from the five-thousand-year ancient culture have been tempered by the great era, so the citizens nurtured in this era are inherently more handsome and healthy than their previous generation. Therefore, the future nation-building work inherently contains a bright and splendid future. However, it must also be able to exert the greatest efforts in terms of personnel to meet the current needs, so that children's welfare and cultivation can all exert great effects. This is another natural duty of every Chinese today besides striving for the War of Resistance, and it is also what should be paid special attention to on this Children's Day.

Telegram of Condolences to Soldiers and Compatriots

Chongqing: The National Political Council passed two telegrams at its third meeting today, one to comfort the frontline soldiers and the other to express sympathy to the compatriots in the war zones. Excerpts are as follows: (1) Telegram of condolences to the frontline soldiers: To Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission, and to the frontline soldiers: Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, our loyal and brave soldiers, under the command of the supreme commander, have killed the enemy and achieved results, defended the country, endured hardships, and become stronger in battle. The recent great victories in northern Hunan and northern Guangdong, and the thwarting of the enemy in southern Guangxi and western Suiyuan, have shifted the overall situation of the War of Resistance and laid the foundation for victory. Their merit lies with the country and will forever be recorded in history. This is due to the effective leadership of our supreme commander, and the dedication and bravery of our national soldiers in battle, which have left an indelible glory in the hearts of the people. We should unite as one, share the same hatred for the enemy, expel the Japanese army, and swiftly carry out divine punishment. We are willing to encourage each other with the soldiers. On the occasion of the fifth session of this council, we respectfully express our condolences and encouragement together. The National Political Council, Jiang. (2) Telegram of sympathy to the compatriots in the war zones: To the Military Affairs Commission, to be forwarded to the compatriots in the war zones: The Japanese army has deeply penetrated for three years now. The suffering and pain experienced by our compatriots in the war zones cannot be described in words. Our compatriots are determined to love the country and unwilling to be trampled upon. Some have requested to fight the enemy, their spirit soaring to the clouds, while others have sacrificed their lives, their glory illuminating the sun and moon. All these commendable and moving deeds prove that the spirit of our nation cannot be extinguished. Our compatriots have always distinguished between loyalty and treachery, and recognized the difference between obedience and defiance. They will endure hardship for a moment, and further encourage loyalty and integrity. As the situation of the War of Resistance improves daily, the members of this council specially express their sincere condolences to our compatriots in the war zones, and are willing to share with our compatriots the arduous tasks of the War of Resistance and national construction, in order to achieve the final victory.

(3rd dispatch)

Chongqing: The National Political Council issued a telegram denouncing the puppet organization in Nanjing, stating that Wang Zhaoming had long been wanted by the government, and this council also issued a telegram denouncing him at the fourth session. Unexpectedly, he showed no remorse and signed a secret agreement with the Japanese invaders. Under the protection and direction of the Japanese invaders, he established a puppet organization in Nanjing, intending to implement the secret agreement to destroy China. It is clearly destroying independence, yet he calls it independence; it is clearly losing freedom, yet he calls it freedom. In fact, all tangible and intangible rights entrusted to national sovereignty and the lifeline of the nation, including political, military, economic, and resource rights, are completely handed over to the Japanese. Yet they shamelessly claim to be saving the country through peace. At the extreme, they want the Chinese nation to perish without knowing it, and to gradually forget all the conditions that an independent country must possess. There has never been a case of surrendering to the enemy to save the country, calling the destruction of the country peace, justifying assisting the enemy in its aggression, or preaching ideologies while surrendering on behalf of the enemy. Since being elected to the council in 1938, we have, under the guiding principles of resistance and national construction, represented the public opinion of the country, assisted the government, and jointly overcome national difficulties. We express our deep hatred for this behavior and once again encourage the military and civilians to jointly punish and eliminate him. As a result of our military and civilians' brave resistance over the past three years, Japan's foundation has been shaken and its people are in panic. The Japanese invaders, although their ambition has not died, have lost their confidence. Their contemptible act of supporting Wang is actually their last futile attempt. Therefore, our military and civilians must respect the achievements of the past, strengthen their confidence in victory, and from now on, with one heart and one mind, strive to fight and give the Japanese their final blow. Furthermore, our compatriots in the front and rear and in the guerrilla areas must always remember the great righteousness that national sovereignty is sacred and inviolable, and the truth that our resistance will surely succeed and our nation will surely be built. How can there be a government in the occupied areas of the Japanese army? How can a false agreement have any effect? How can the national sovereignty safeguarded by the blood and sweat of 450 million compatriots be stolen by the Japanese puppets? How can the international reputation earned by countless loyal and brave soldiers and various diligent workers through three years of bloody battles be shaken by the Japanese? Therefore, only by strengthening the Chinese nation's determination to resist and seeking the most rapid victory can we achieve our goals. As for the friendly nations of the world, they have long had a correct understanding and will not be misled by Japanese puppet propaganda. It goes without saying that the cleansing of filth and the restoration of our homeland depend on the intensified efforts of all compatriots. Respectfully submitted for your consideration.

### Nationwide Financial Network Gradually Completed: Four Major Banks Establish Branches Throughout the Country, Exceeding 300 Locations Including the Southwest and Northwest

Chongqing: The Ministry of Finance, in order to circulate finance in the rear and strengthen economic power, had previously formulated a two-year plan to complete the financial network in the southwest, northwest, and neighboring war zones. The steps are as follows: (1) For towns and cities in the rear that are related to politics, economy, transportation, and commodity distribution, and that do not yet have branches of the four major banks, the Joint Office of the Four Banks is responsible for ensuring that at least one bank goes to establish an agency. (2) For locations that are slightly remote, the four banks may not be able to take care of them in the short term, so the provincial banks of each province are responsible for ensuring that they go to establish branches, with the principle of at least one bank in each location. (3) In the process of establishing branches in various towns and cities, the cooperative treasury and the postal savings and remittance bureau will assist in the local financial turnover and remittance circulation. (4) The same shall apply to establishing branches in areas adjacent to the war zone. In the first phase of completing the financial network, the four banks have established a total of 154 new branches in the southwest and northwest regions for the above-mentioned purposes. Among them, the Central Bank added 33 branches, the Bank of China 59, the Bank of Communications 26, and the Farmers Bank 36. The areas where new branches were established include 63 in Sichuan, 18 in Yunnan, 18 in Guizhou, 21 in Guangxi, 2 in Guangdong, 5 in Hunan, 15 in Shaanxi, 14 in Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia combined, and 3 in Xikang. In addition, 60 branches were added in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hubei, and Fujian provinces. In total, the four major banks have more than 300 branches throughout the country. In addition, more than 60 branches are planned to be established in the southwest and northwest in stages. It is estimated that the great plan to complete the nationwide financial network can be completed within this year. (3rd dispatch)

### Japan Expresses Apology for Anti-British Riot in Zhangde

A Japanese military spokesman stated that he felt sincere regret for the occurrence of such an incident. Therefore, the British Embassy authorities here have received instructions not to take further action on this matter. (3rd dispatch, Reuters)

### Note from Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Envoys of Various Countries Unanimously Published in Soviet Newspapers: The So-Called "New Order in East Asia" Will Encounter Great Difficulties; The Chinese People's Determination to Resist Will Surely Achieve Victory

Moscow: All major newspapers have unanimously published the full text of the note from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the envoys of various countries, denying the puppet organization. Soviet people expressed indignation after learning of the establishment of the puppet organization, and recognized that the puppet organization is merely a tool of Japanese imperialism. Political figures also stated that the Japanese army's establishment of the so-called "New Order in East Asia" will inevitably encounter great difficulties. Recently, Soviet newspapers have continuously criticized the puppet organization, which proves the direction of public opinion. For example, the Labor Daily published an article on January 26 by Soviet Supreme Soviet representative Sobolev, which stated, "We hope that China will win the War of Resistance. The Soviet people are paying close attention to Japan's scheme to establish a puppet organization. However, I dare to say that this farcical drama will surely arouse the indignation of the Soviet people. Japan is now dreaming of becoming the master of East Asia, and is using the organization of a small number of people to threaten 450 million people." The Truth newspaper of March 25 also wrote, "The reason why the Japanese warlords are eager to establish a puppet organization is that their position in the occupied areas is not as solid as before, so they want the puppet organization to maintain it. The slogan of the puppet organization is peace and anti-communism. However, since (1937), the Chinese people have known that the true meaning of this slogan is to trap the Chinese people in a position of slavery." Yesterday's Truth newspaper also published an article examining Japan's economic difficulties, the content of which was largely taken from the American "National Weekly." The conclusion stated that Japan's recent statement that it does not want to advance further into China is not its political wisdom, but its military necessity. Although Japan has not yet collapsed, China's chances of winning are greater than Japan's. The puppet organization will never weaken the Chinese people's determination to resist. (2nd dispatch)

### United States Must Consider Embargo for the Sake of Public Opinion and National Reputation; Retaining Rights in China, If Trampled Upon, Can Immediately Take Retaliatory Measures

New York: The New York Public Opinion Forum published an editorial on the relations between the United States and Japan, stating that Rear Admiral Yarnall, the former commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, recently said that Japan's adventurous behavior in Asia has sunk deep into the mud, and that fighting the United States again would be tantamount to suicide. The implication is that Japan is not yet prepared for suicide. Rear Admiral Yarnall is not one to make alarmist statements, and we share his views. As for whether the United States should prohibit the shipment of certain goods to Japan after the expiration of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty, the country would not immediately use it as a reason for declaring war, which is almost meaningless. However, the Japanese government had previously allowed newspapers to publish fierce articles commenting on the embargo issue. It can be seen that if the US Congress does pass an embargo bill, Japanese public opinion will definitely strongly demand that the country's government take retaliatory measures, which the country's government may find difficult to refuse at that time. This should not be ignored. Even if Japan has the possibility of taking retaliatory measures, we cannot therefore fail to consider embargo measures. Considering the situation, public opinion, and national honor, if Americans believe that the embargo is a necessary course of action, then it will be difficult to use the risks that this measure may entail as an argument to dissuade them. However, if Americans want to take this risk, they must prepare in advance and pay close attention to it. (2nd dispatch, Havas)

Washington: The Washington Daily News said, "If Japanese soldiers force the Jingwei to trample upon the rights that the United States still retains in China, then the United States government should constantly send notes to this meticulously protected gentleman, and at the same time indicate to the Japanese government that the United States may prohibit the export of certain goods to Japan, or may impose special taxes on goods imported into the United States from Japan. These two methods can be implemented simultaneously." (2nd dispatch, Havas News Agency)

### Japanese Newspapers Actually Publish Articles Blaming American Arbitrariness, Threatening That the Difficult Situation in the Far East Cannot Be Resolved

Tokyo: A certain Japanese newspaper recently published an editorial comparing the attitudes of the British and American ambassadors in Tokyo, and believed that the United States' attitude towards Japan's policy was "arrogant." The newspaper pointed out that US Ambassador to Japan Grew made inflammatory remarks about Japan's actions in China, saying that the United States was not self-restrained and was attempting to judge Japan's behavior. If the United States insists on this attitude, the difficult situation in the Far East will persist and cannot be resolved. The United States is truly arbitrary and does not observe reality. The newspaper also claimed that although Britain's activities in China are not in harmony with Japan's, it can understand the reality and study the position it should take to protect and develop its interests. "The new government in Nanjing" seems to have "constituted an important factor and cannot be overturned by any opposing opinion." (3rd dispatch, United Press)

### Political Offensive: Hull's Strong Declaration Deals a Major Blow to Japan

Paris: The establishment of the "Wang Jingwei regime" was recently commented on by the Progressive Socialist Party's Enterprise News, which stated, "The Italian government submitted an answer almost immediately after receiving the notification from the 'Wang regime.' Therefore, the Japanese government was very pleased yesterday morning. On the contrary, the news from Washington did not make Tokyo feel happy. As far as we know, difficulties arise between the 'Wang regime' and the Japanese government every day. In fact, Wang intends for Japan to pacify China on its behalf, while the Japanese government only seeks its own interests and limits the power of the 'Wang regime' to the major cities, not allowing it to expand. For this reason, the two sides are arguing strongly over the issue of authority, and are criticizing each other for 'quibbling over the words.' Until US Secretary of State Hull issued a declaration stating that the country only recognizes the Chongqing National Government, the Japanese government suffered a major blow. Some of the people around Prime Minister Yonai still have an illusion that Britain and France may not hold the same views as the United States. However, some newspapers do not think so, and criticize the Yonai cabinet for not expressing satisfaction with the 'Wang regime,' because the establishment of the 'Wang regime' does not mean that the China Incident is about to end. 'Those newspapers know it very well.'" (3rd dispatch, Havas)

### US Navy Conducts Preliminary Exercises in the Pacific: Navy Secretary Edison Personally Commands; Large Fleet Has Sailed to Hawaii

San Pedro: The US Navy's "Black" and "White" fleets have conducted preliminary exercises in the Pacific. A large fleet has sailed to Hawaii to begin the 1940 exercises in clear weather. Yesterday morning, the fleet advanced one after another. Shortly after midnight, the first destroyer left the port of San Diego, followed by three others. The destroyers waited outside the port for the cruisers to sail out and form a line. The battleships left the port last. Navy Secretary Edison and US Fleet Commander-in-Chief Richardson commanded together on the aft deck of the flagship "Pennsylvania." It is heard that after the large ships refuel and take on water in Hawaii, they will be divided into "Purple" and "Maroon" fleets to engage in large-scale naval exercises. (3rd dispatch, United Press)

Chongqing: The Saodang News here recently published an article commenting on the US naval maneuvers, stating that the US Navy's large-scale maneuvers in the Pacific are actually a posture against the puppet government in Nanjing. US Secretary of State Hull has already stated that he does not recognize the puppet government and has also criticized Japan's attempt to monopolize China and harm the interests of third countries. Therefore, this exercise is sufficient to show that after Hull's statement on March 30, the US Army, Navy, and Air Force are preparing. It can also be said to be the prelude to the US blockade of Japan, and it can be regarded as the US stepping up efforts to consolidate the defense of the Pacific, so that Japan's southward advance will suffer a serious blow.

### Japan Will Send Kato to Central and South America

Nanjing: Japanese newspapers reported that Kato Gaimatsu, the Japanese special envoy to China, will be appointed as a special envoy to Central and South American countries. The Japanese government's dispatch of Kato to Central and South American countries is linked to the Tokyo government's policy of correcting its economic dependence on the United States and simultaneously expanding Japanese trade with Latin American countries. The Japanese government has been working hard to promote Japanese trade with Central and South American countries. Economic survey groups from Argentina and Peru recently visited Japan, and an economic survey group from Mexico is also on its way to Japan. Kato will leave Japan for the United States in early April. (3rd dispatch, United Press)

### British Ambassador to Japan's Speech Attracts Attention of Members of Parliament; Since Butler's Reply to the Labor Party's Inquiry, There Has Been No Fundamental Change in British Far East Policy

London: The speech delivered by Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, at the dinner party of the Japan-British Association in Tokyo on the 28th of last month, has attracted the attention of members of the Lower House. At the afternoon session of the Lower House today, Labor Party member Baker asked, "Does Ambassador Craigie's speech mean that the government's current policy in the Far East is about to change, or does the government still intend to thoroughly implement the policy of assisting the National Government of China? Please ask the Prime Minister to explain." Undersecretary Butler immediately replied, "Foreign Secretary Halifax has already taken note of this speech. Our envoys abroad are not in the habit of seeking the Foreign Secretary's agreement on the content of their speeches beforehand. However, Foreign Secretary Halifax is still prepared to take responsibility for the points made by Ambassador Craigie. The Ambassador also asked me to state on his behalf that his original intention was not to say that there has been any change in the country's current policy, or that there is any discrepancy with what the government has repeatedly told the Lower House. It can be seen that the government's view of continuing to recognize the Chongqing National Government as the legitimate government of China, and its general attitude towards the Far East issue, have not changed in any way. That is, the government's desire for the Far East dispute to be resolved according to fair conditions has never changed." (3rd dispatch, Havas)

### Japan Conspires with Germany, Italy, and Spain in Secret, Allegedly Granting Economic Privileges

Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun reported that Italian experts have been deeply interested in public transport businesses and road plans in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beiping, and Guangzhou. Plans for road construction projects in Beiping and Tianjin, and for traffic programs in Shanghai City, have been submitted to the "Chinese" and Japanese authorities in China. The Japanese side managing these matters is currently giving friendly consideration to the Italian proposals. (3rd dispatch, Reuters)

Paris: After discussing the establishment of Wang Jingwei's "Nanjing Government" yesterday, the Chamber of Deputies adjourned the meeting to Thursday of this week. Well-informed sources said that the "Nanjing Government" may be recognized by Madrid and Rome, with preferential economic conditions in China as an exchange. According to Le Parisien, Tokyo is putting pressure on Berlin to avoid weakening its friendly relations with Berlin and Rome. The newspaper said that if Moscow guarantees that it will not intensify its military intentions in the Far East after the end of the Soviet-Finnish war during the meeting between Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, then Tokyo can also obtain a guarantee as a result.

### Foreign Military Experts Claim: Chinese Troops Fight Bravely, Recapturing Kunlun Pass and Achieving Objective

Chongqing – According to a foreign military expert who witnessed the Chinese troops recapturing the strategically important Kunlun Pass northeast of Nanning a few months ago, the bravery of the Chinese soldiers is truly admirable.  This location serves as the gateway to Nanning, and the Japanese army had stationed a large force to defend it. The Chinese army, in an attempt to recapture Nanning, launched a fierce offensive. Despite suffering serious losses, they ultimately achieved their objective of recapturing the pass.  It is said that the Chinese army lost nine tanks during the offensive, but according to the Chinese army, three of them have been recovered.  The expert personally witnessed three tanks being towed back for repairs. The expert highly praised the fighting spirit of the Chinese soldiers and was particularly impressed by the achievements of some small squads. He believes that the Chinese military authorities should not only promote commanders or give soldiers cash as rewards but also award medals to encourage lower-ranking officers and soldiers. The expert believes that the Chinese army's offensive on Kunlun Pass seemed to lack "sustained effort," which is crucial in any large-scale military operation. If the Chinese army could capitalize on its gains and continue to strike the enemy, the significance of this battle would be even greater. The expert also commented on the Japanese army's attack on Pinyang, saying it was merely a raid. The Japanese army sent a brigade to carry out a large detour to try to relieve the crisis at Kunlun Pass. However, this move by the Japanese army was a little too late, because while the Japanese army was still taking the offensive, the Chinese army had already recaptured the pass.  Even under these circumstances, the Japanese army continued to advance towards Pinyang because the Japanese army on this route belonged to a raiding force and did not attempt to maintain contact with the rear, so it was intercepted by the Chinese army. Due to the lack of sufficient coordinated action by the Chinese army units, most of the Japanese army was still able to retreat towards Nanning. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Chamberlain Declares: Strengthening Economic Warfare Against Germany, Determined to Strictly Limit Neutral Country Trade, Declares Willingness to Maintain Balkan Peace

London – British Prime Minister Chamberlain discussed in the House of Commons last night the British attitude towards neutral countries supplying Germany with goods and the situation in the Balkan Peninsula. When he spoke about goods being shipped to Germany, he issued the statement, "We want to adopt a corresponding plan," implying an intensification of the economic blockade. Chamberlain also refuted German propaganda accusing the Allied powers of deliberately disrupting peace in the Balkan Peninsula. Chamberlain said, “Germany may have found ways to increase supplies from neutral countries using routes not previously used. We have paid attention to this possibility. We have reviewed the general situation and plan to adopt a corresponding plan. On this point, I can inform the members of the House that the British government has recently intercepted in the Far East territorial waters a Soviet ship suspected of carrying contraband to Vladivostok for transshipment to Germany. The wartime commercial agreements we have concluded all contain clauses restricting neutral countries from transporting their domestic products to Germany. To cite an example, this clause stipulates that the export to Germany of oils and fats necessary for Germany's war effort must be strictly limited. In addition, our procurement methods are also a powerful weapon in our arsenal. We certainly cannot purchase all the surplus that Germany's neighboring countries can export, but we are actively increasing purchases of certain selected goods, such as mineral oil and fats, and now the supply of these goods to Germany has been greatly reduced. For example, we have now agreed to buy all the surplus whale oil available for export from Norway this season. Although I am not at liberty to elaborate, I can say that the Allied powers are procuring minerals in Southeast Europe on a very large scale. British trade with Germany's neighbors has indeed developed greatly, and I hope that the strengthening of trade exchanges will benefit both sides. At the same time, the countries concerned must understand that if they are not prepared to give us guarantees that they will limit their subsequent trade with Germany, then we cannot rely on them to obtain products from the British Empire. We have recently heard about the possible developments in Southeast Europe. German propaganda even says that the aim of the Allied powers is to disrupt the peace of the Balkan Peninsula countries, but this is not the case. We have made very effective contributions to Turkey to maintain peace and security in Southeast Europe. In order to study many urgent political and economic issues, the British government has decided to recall the ministers stationed in the Balkan countries to the UK for discussion, and the British ambassador to Italy will also take a short leave of absence to come to London at this time. I expect the House will welcome this move. We hope that the discussions of the British ministers in the Balkan countries in London will have a positive result for the Allied powers' doctrine and the maintenance of peace and security in the Balkans.” (Reuters, 3rd)

### British Diplomatic Maneuvering: European Situation Enters New Phase, Britain Concludes Wartime Trade Agreements Separately With Neutral Countries

London – Authoritative sources here said today that Britain has concluded new wartime trade agreements with four neutral countries, and another four more important agreements have also been drafted. According to reports from senior officials, the agreements contain important clauses according to which neutral countries will no longer re-export goods and raw materials to Germany. According to British and French diplomatic warfare in Europe, efforts are being made to starve Germany and fill the loopholes in its blockade lines in Scandinavia, the Balkans, and Denmark, Belgium, etc. Therefore, the conclusion of the above agreements indicates that the European diplomatic war has entered a new phase. It is said that the efforts of Britain and France are particularly focused on the Balkan countries. It is also said that among these agreements, those signed with Denmark and the Netherlands have already signed the first letter. The clauses stipulate that the two neutral countries of Denmark and the Netherlands can import goods sufficient for their normal needs without any hindrance, but they must not use the raw materials they import to make goods and then re-export them to Germany. Those concluded with Greece and Spain have also been completed. In addition, it is also said that the British-South African commercial negotiations were held here yesterday, and similar consultations between Britain and Romania will also be held in the next few days. As for the clause in the agreement that forces neutral countries to voluntarily not re-export to Germany, it comes from the unilateral opinion of the United Kingdom, so the neutral countries will not adopt severe blockade measures based on this clause, as the United States did when it joined the last World War in 1918. According to a British spokesperson, although the Allied powers feel the need to intensify the blockade, the government believes that the rationing system of giving food by the day in 1918 is a last resort. The spokesperson also said that "the Soviet Union's supply to Germany" is not a cause for concern. The Soviet Union is too busy to supply itself, let alone Germany.

London – Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons yesterday that Britain and Denmark began commercial negotiations in November last year and signed a commercial agreement as of yesterday.

### Neutral Countries: Feel Uneasy, Deeply Fear German Retaliation

Amsterdam – After reading Chamberlain's speech, political circles here are not without anxiety and still believe that Britain has not fully understood the position of neutral countries. Giving Britain a guarantee to restrict trade with Germany is a non-neutral action and will put the Netherlands at risk of retaliatory action from Germany. (Reuters, 3rd)

Berlin – Political circles here believe that British Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks indicate that the Allied powers will regard the rights of neutral countries as non-existent whenever they deem it appropriate. (Reuters, 3rd)

Berlin – Regarding the speech given by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons yesterday, German political figures have recently commented, stating that the statement proves two points: (1) Britain and France have decided to infringe on the neutrality of other countries at any time, because Chamberlain declared that British warships will be prepared to attack German merchant ships within the territorial waters of Scandinavian countries in the future; (2) Britain and France are prepared to destroy the entire economic structure of Europe.

Ankara – The main news carried by the local newspapers is the news that the Allied powers have requested Turkey to allow warships to pass through the Dardanelles Strait. However, this news has been officially denied by London. According to local responsible sources, Turkey will not violate its promise and will strictly abide by the Montreux Treaty and will not allow warships of warring nations to pass through this strait when Turkey maintains neutrality.

### Sweden Reaffirms Strict Neutrality: Determined to Exert National Strength to Uphold Independent Rights

Swedish Capital – Swedish Minister of Defense Scholt said in Uppsala last night that if Swedish territory is attacked, the Swedish people will exert all their strength to expel the invaders. If anyone threatens Sweden's independence, Sweden will do its best to defend itself with arms. As long as the European powers fight to the death, Sweden's fate will be precarious. New and serious threats will occur at any time, so the Swedish people must prepare for the worst and never slack off. A weak country whose strength does not allow it to be involved in threats, Sweden must adopt a neutrality policy based on respecting Sweden's legitimate rights and treating the warring nations impartially in order to seek Sweden's independence.

### Goering Urges the Air Force Youth League: To Strive Hard Externally, So As To Achieve The Purpose Of Glorious Victory

Berlin – German Aviation Minister General Goering delivered a speech to the Hitler Youth Aviation League in the auditorium of the new Air Force building today and broadcast it to factories, schools, and companies across the country. His words were roughly as follows: I would like to remind you that what the leader Hitler said about Germany's current hard struggle will create the most glorious victory in German history. Germany has now entered the second stage of the struggle. The first stage has ended victoriously. The first stage is the struggle of National Socialism. During the World War, Germany endured for four and a half years with the greatest strength. After the war, Germany was almost exhausted, but at this historical turning point, Hitler rose to lead the people to carry out the work of national revival. This first stage of the struggle has now been successfully completed on January 30, 1933. What follows is the second stage of external struggle, which is currently at its most intense. External struggles can also be successful, just like the result of the first stage of internal struggle. In fact, the environment of the first stage of struggle was more difficult than the current one, because at that time there was a lack of human and material resources, relying only on the belief of the nation. General Goering then solemnly stated that the preliminary condition for building a great Germany is to build Germany's new air force. Today, the amazing achievements of the German air force have been recognized by young people across the country and will have even greater achievements in the future. Speaking to this point, Goering briefly described the process of Germany's annexation of the Sudetenland, Memel region, and the establishment of the Polish Protectorate, and then said that the dreams of thousands of years of Germany have now been realized. Great Germany has been created by Hitler and has become one of the world's powers again. German youth should be determined to continue the struggle and create Germany's future. The enemy's current war aim is to plunge Germany back into a weak country. When Germany was working hard on revival and reconstruction, the enemy tried to hinder it in many ways, but it was ultimately ineffective, thus causing this war. At this point, the enemy will be taught a lesson for attacking Germany. The Polish war was a major blow to the enemy. Germany has no fear of being attacked from both the front and the back. The German air force can fully resist Britain and France on the Western Front. The leader Hitler has announced to the national army that they are responsible for protecting the country. You young people should work together for the glory and freedom of Germany in the future. (Haitong News Agency, 2nd)

Paris – Former French Finance Minister, now Prime Minister Reynaud, and U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles reviewed a map of European borders at a meeting at the French Ministry of Finance the other day. The outside world saw this map and thought that the Allied powers wanted to create a future Europe by dividing the land and creating territories such as Poland and Austria. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a communiqué to dispel the rumors, saying that this map shows the European borders before Germany's repeated invasions in recent years. However, when the photographer made this country, he mentioned some border lines. Italian newspapers mistakenly believed that this map included the Italian Trieste region in Austrian territory, and public opinion was in an uproar. (Reuters, 3rd)

### British Wartime Cabinet: To Be Reorganized Imminently

London – It is generally expected that Prime Minister Chamberlain will take the opportunity of the death of Minister of Navigation Kilmore to announce changes to cabinet members. No one knows the Prime Minister's will yet, but it is expected that First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill may concurrently serve as the director of a new agency with the nature of a national defense conference. This does not seem to affect the position of the current Minister for Coordination of Defence. Hoare and Wood seem to be swapped positions, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister of Food Morrison may leave the Ministry of Food and be able to take on other duties, but will still retain the first position. The vacant position of Minister of Food will be filled by Hulton, who has been assisting with everything in the Ministry of Supply since the outbreak of the war. (Reuters, 3rd)

Washington – Secretary of State Hull met with Soviet Ambassador to the United States Oumansky today for talks that lasted for hours. Afterwards, Secretary of State Hull issued a statement to the press saying that both sides had discussed the general relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. The US measures of ceasing the transport of aircraft and aircraft manufacturing materials to the Soviet Union due to the Soviet Air Force bombing of innocent civilians in Finland, that is, the "moral embargo" measures, are still in effect. Although this was also touched upon during today's talks, no decision was made. Ambassador Oumansky refused to explain the reason for meeting Secretary of State Hull today, saying only that he had neither advocated anything nor delivered any written documents to Secretary of State Hull during the talks.

### German, Italian, and South Cabinets: Arrive in Hungarian Capital Together, The Mission Undertaken By This Trip Attracts Attention From All Parties

Yugoslav Capital – Minister Without Portfolio Konstantinovic, a well-known jurist, recently went to the Hungarian capital with Minister of Agriculture Subrilovic. Hearing this, all the onlookers were deeply surprised, saying that the trip of the two men happened to coincide with the simultaneous arrival of German Minister of Agriculture Darré and Italian Minister of Agriculture Basianteri in Hungary, which was very noteworthy. Since Konstantinovic is a jurist, he has no experience in discussing economic issues. This time, he is accompanying the Minister of Agriculture to Hungary. It is difficult to say whether there are other missions. However, well-informed sources believe that there have been frequent exchanges between Hungary and South Korea recently. This trip by the South Korean cabinet members is just a continuation of expressing their eagerness to approach Hungary. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)

### Fierce Air Combat Occurs Along the Dutch Border: Dutch Aircraft Deployed to Protect Neutrality, Active Air Forces on Both Sides of the Western Front

Amsterdam – German aircraft and Allied aircraft engaged in fierce air combat over the Dutch border last night. Tens of thousands of local residents looked up to watch the battle. Dutch aircraft took off to patrol and protect Dutch neutrality. Residents of many places in the eastern and central parts of the Netherlands also came out to watch.

The sound of anti-aircraft guns from the German border was also heard. A smokescreen filled the sky over the border, especially the sky near Zutphen was the thickest. The claim that combat aircraft passed over Dutch airspace could not be confirmed, but the roar of the aircraft engines did not stop at night. Onlookers saw five large searchlights open on the German side of the border near Bogen City, illuminating the sky continuously. An aircraft was seen being hit by the lights, but the aircraft eventually evaded the lights and left. (Reuters, 3rd)

The second British aircraft fired at the enemy. The bullets fell like rain. The author witnessed a German aircraft being hit with holes in both wings. Smoke came out and fell downwards. The third British aircraft engaged a German aircraft head-on. Although the British aircraft driver was injured in the face, he finally saw the enemy aircraft unable to control itself. It rotated straight down. The British aircraft resumed fighting another German aircraft, but there was no loss. He returned to defense safely. In this battle, three British aircraft each shot down one enemy aircraft.

According to international law, the Danish government also has a responsibility to demand the release of the captain of the "Stinnes," who was arrested. (Haitong, 3rd)

London – News has just been received from Cairo, the capital of Egypt, stating that the Egyptian government, after the conclusion of the current congress of the National Party, submitted a note to the British Ambassador to Egypt, Lampson, declaring that the entire Egyptian people sympathize with Britain and have decided to cooperate with Britain in all aspects during the current war. If any other country dares to invade, Egypt will definitely resist. In addition, five demands were made: (1) British troops stationed in Egypt should be withdrawn at the end of the European war, and all the defense areas left behind should be taken over by the Egyptian army. (2) The Anglo-Egyptian military alliance treaty remains in effect, but due to the war, the clause in the treaty that the Egyptian government should build barracks for the British army is practically difficult to implement. (3) Egypt should have the right to participate in peace talks at the end of the European war. (4) The UK and Egypt should negotiate so that the UK recognizes Egypt's rights in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. (5) The martial law declared by the British military authorities in Egypt should be lifted. Ambassador Lampson has submitted this note to the British Foreign Office. (Havas, 3rd)

### Molotov's Speech: Full Text (Continued and Completed)

In short, the Soviet Union's treaties with Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are being faithfully implemented. The overall development of relations between the three countries is truly unlimited.

Recently, foreign newspapers have expressed great concern about the Soviet Union and its relationship with its southern border neighbors, especially the Caucasus border and Romania. Our government also feels that there is no reason for our relations with our southern neighbors to deteriorate. This is self-evident. The UK and France are organizing colonial armies in Syria and the Near East, led by General Weygand, undertaking large-scale suspicious activities. This is a matter of fact. We must be vigilant against any attempt to use these colonial or non-colonial troops to take anti-Soviet action. Any such attempt will trigger our action against the aggressors. Countries that are hostile to the Soviet Union or neighbors that will become tools of aggression against the Soviet Union will clearly see the consequences. As for our country's relations with Turkey and Iran, they can be determined by the mutual non-aggression treaties of both parties and the Soviet Union's determination to abide by its obligations. Our country's economic relations with Iran can be adjusted by the Soviet-Iranian trade agreement signed not long ago. Among the southern neighbors I mentioned, Romania does not have a mutual non-aggression treaty with us. This is because there are unresolved disputes between the two countries. The Soviet Union has never recognized Romania's occupation of Bessarabia, but has never raised the issue of recovering Bessarabia by military force. Therefore, there is no reason for the deterioration of Soviet-Romanian relations. Although our country has long withdrawn its ambassador to Romania and replaced him with a counselor, this was caused by special circumstances in the recent past.

Regarding this point, we should remember the Romanian authorities' treatment of the former Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Romania, Butenko, in 1938. Butenko suddenly disappeared in Romania and has not been heard from since, but the Romanian authorities deny any involvement in the matter.

There is no doubt that such facts should never happen in civilized and orderly countries. The reason why the Soviet Union has been slow to send a new ambassador to Romania since then does not need to be explained. We believe that the Romanian authorities have recognized the Soviet Union's determination not to tolerate such behavior. The Soviet government has now taken steps to connect the areas leading to the Soviet Union and the original area of the Karelian Isthmus. The Petrozavodsk-Suoyarvi railway, which has already been built, connects the capital of Karelia and the Murmansk Railway with the Suoyarvi-Raivola line. The Kandalaksha-Kuolajärvi line is currently under construction and will be completed soon. This line will connect Karelia with the area of Kuolajärvi in the Soviet Union. With the exception of a small portion, the industry incorporated into Karelian territory is handled by the Karelian Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic.

Since this time the Karelian Republic is one of the federations, there is a need to discuss its name. The entire Karelian region does not completely belong to Karelia. A part of it is purely Finnish territory. The Finnish and Karelian peoples have close relations in terms of race and bloodline. This time, changing the Karelian Autonomous Republic to the Karelian-Finnish Federal Republic will enable the economic and cultural development of the two ethnic groups to be further developed and their friendship to be further enhanced, while eliminating their accumulated hatred of many years. The Soviet Council of People's Commissars has authorized me to draft regulations on the renaming of Karelia and submit them to the Supreme Soviet for review.

This new Federal Republic will participate in the other Federal Republics of the Soviet Union. This is a major new development in the unity of the various Federations of the Soviet Union. During this era of imperialist enslavement of the masses, imperialist wars have intensified national and colonial oppression. The rights and interests of small countries have become pocket change in the hands of imperialists. The establishment of our new Federal Republic during this period is enough to emphasize the benefits of the Soviet system guaranteeing the full development of small countries.

I am convinced that the Karelian-Finnish Federal Republic will not only become a barrier to peace and security on the northwestern border of the Soviet Union, but also become one of the most progressive pages in the Federal Republic." (TASS, 31st)

### Situation in the Balkans: Fierce Competition Among Countries, Military Developments Dependent on Politics

The Balkan Entente countries (Turkey, Greece, Romania, Yugoslavia) recently held a meeting in the Yugoslav capital. A total of 200 well-known journalists went to cover the news, which shows the importance of the meeting. What this meeting decided will have to be proven by the facts, but some basic military issues can be studied now, which will be beneficial to the evolution of the situation in the Balkan Peninsula in the future.

Bulgaria and Hungary are not Balkan Entente countries. They both hold irredentist policies, especially against Romania. They have both been rearmed by Germany. The Soviet Union also has a strong influence in Bulgaria. Italian diplomacy is very active in both Hungary and Bulgaria. However, these two countries do not have any truly significant disputes with Yugoslavia. Hungary is geographically sufficient to protect Romania, preventing Germany from going south. Bulgaria can prevent Britain, France and Turkey from providing land assistance to Romania. Therefore, Bulgaria and Hungary occupy a pivotal position in the dangerous situation in the Balkan Peninsula.

Secondly, Italy's attitude must also be taken into account. The four battleships that the country has built may be completed this spring. At that time, the country's navy will become a more important element. When making decisions regarding the Mediterranean Sea, the countries concerned may need to weigh the pros and cons. This kind of navy is located on the transportation lines of the British, French, and Near Eastern troops and the allies of Britain and France (Turkey and Egypt), at least making it impossible for Britain and France to rest easy. This kind of navy of Italy greatly helps the country's policy and bargaining power. Italy's policy can be considered to be firmly opposed to the Soviet Union's expansion of power into the Balkan region, but it is not necessarily opposed to Germany.

Italy has a particularly strong influence in Yugoslavia. The country's coastline is under the control of the Italian fleet, and there are also two land borders with Italy, although these two borders are mountainous and difficult to pass. There are rumors that Italy, Yugoslavia, and Hungary have a joint military "understanding."

The Yugoslav army is well-trained and skillfully commanded, and can be called a strong force, but its modern equipment is insufficient. The country's terrain is rugged, far more so than Poland and Romania. It will not be easy for Germany to attack it. On the other hand, Yugoslavia would not dare to attack Germany rashly without a guarantee of rapid assistance. Although Yugoslav public opinion favors aiding Britain and France, there are many other issues to consider.

Among the Balkan countries, Romania is in the most dangerous situation. If Germany attacks through Hungary, or together with that country and the Soviet Union, Romania may be able to resist temporarily, but unless it receives foreign aid, long-term resistance is unlikely.

The assistance of Turkey and Britain and France can reach Romania from land through Bulgaria, or from the sea and air. Turkey may exert sufficient pressure on Bulgaria to allow this aid to pass through. At that time, it will be difficult for Germany to stand up for Bulgaria, and the Bulgarian army will not have the strength to fight Turkey. As for the Soviet Union's assistance to Bulgaria, it must pass through Romania, which is time-consuming and unstable. If the sea route is taken, the Turkish fleet can intercept it with the reinforcement of the British and French navies. The fighting power of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet may not be as strong as the Turkish fleet. It cannot guarantee the safety of Soviet reinforcements at sea, nor can it prevent Britain, France, and Turkey from taking the sea route to aid Romania. However, there are also difficulties on the side of Britain and France. Although the countries have sufficient transport ships, it takes a long time for Romanian reinforcements to land, and it takes even longer under air strikes.

The time factor is very important in the evolution of the situation in the Balkans. How Germany acts may depend on this. Because Germany will not easily try any military adventures in the Balkan Peninsula without the certainty of a quick victory. Quickly annexing Romania with 20 or 30 divisions is one thing, and fighting a long-term desperate battle with the joint forces of Turkey and Romania aided by the British and French Near East Army is another. If Germany disregards everything and engages in a long-term war in the Balkans, its strength will be greatly depleted, weakening its position on the Western Front. Germany has tried its best to avoid a long-term war in Poland, so it may not dare to fall into a similar vortex in Romania under more difficult circumstances. But one thing to note is that since the Soviet Union used troops against Poland, ending the Polish war early, why can't it take the same action against Romania?

A joint German-Soviet attack on Romania has all sorts of opportunities to gain a strong foothold in the Danube region before Turkey and Britain and France can send large troops to Romania. However, this attempt will inevitably arouse active hostility from Italy. From this point of view, the situation in the Balkan Peninsula is still chaotic and uneasy, depending on how various forces and interests are balanced and drawn together. The military factors in between need to be determined by how political adjustments are made. (Translated from the New York Herald Tribune)

Our nation is persevering in fighting to resist insults and seek survival, and our country is vigorously fighting to resist the war and survive. The final victory is already in sight. Only if each of us guards our posts, works hard from our positions, is unyielding, united in spirit, and united in mind and morality, and supports the national policy of resistance and reconstruction, can we complete the mission of revitalizing the nation.

### Western Football Club Angered by Rejection of Chinese Team Protest: Not Only No Explanation Given, but Players Severely Penalized - A Laughingstock in Sports, a Stain on the International Cup

In the list of penalties announced by the Western Football Club earlier this week, all those punished were Chinese, and the severity of the penalties set a new record for the season. Li Du, Meng Yangliang, and Jiang Zhaoxiang were all banned from playing in the remaining games of the season. Captain Sun Jinshun also received a very severe warning, and Jia Youliang of Donghua was also reprimanded. Those concerned about football were shocked upon hearing this but did not know the reasons for the penalties. Now it is learned that Meng and Jia were punished based on the China-Portugal final in the International Cup, and Jiang Zhaoxiang was punished for the consequences of being sent off during the Scoloto Cup final. As for the reasons for punishing Meng and Jia, they are extremely ridiculous. According to the written explanation sent by the Western Club, Sun Jinshun's offense is translated as "ungentlemanly conduct," referring to the fact that after referee Pantuo unfairly penalized the Chinese team with a fabricated penalty kick, Captain Sun Jinshun should not have protested on the spot, which incited the audience, led to accusations, and disrupted order on the field. As for Meng Yiliang, he did not receive any warnings from referee Pantuo during the International Cup, nor did he make any transgressions. In the referee's report after the game, there was no mention of Meng Yi deserving punishment, yet he received such a severe penalty. It is truly "wanting to condemn someone, one can always find a reason." As for Sun Jinshun, it is even more laughable, as he is the captain and has the responsibility to protest when the referee makes a mistake. The Western Club wants the captain to be silenced and then accuses him of inciting the audience and charges him with "ungentlemanly conduct." This is completely absurd. The motive for this penalty is purely the International Cup final. The players being punished are members of the Chinese team, and their affiliated clubs should not be listed in the penalty notice. If they must be listed, it should be clearly stated "Chinese team members." Regarding the delivery procedure of the penalty notice, the Western Club did not take appropriate measures. The Western League did not send the penalty notice to Mr. Shen Siliang, the person in charge of the Chinese team, or Li Baojun, the manager of the Chinese team, but directly sent it to the clubs to which the penalized players belonged, which was a case of mistaken identity. Therefore, it was returned by various clubs the next day, with the explanation that it was a "misdelivery." After the Chinese team protested the referee's dereliction of duty in the China-Portugal final of the International Cup, it was rejected by the Western League Executive Committee, and the reasons have not been made public. Instead, this penalty notice was issued, which shows the Western Club's bizarre actions.

### Finance: Rumors of Escalating European War Trigger Limited Foreign Exchange Buying

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw HSBC's listed prices unchanged. The unofficial British and American exchange markets have been unusually calm recently, with only small movements by speculators causing minor fluctuations in exchange rates. Therefore, the situation today was the same. Initially, due to a two-point increase in exchange rates, the US dollar opened lower by 0.0625 at 6.125 yuan, while the British pound remained unchanged. Subsequently, speculators sold heavily, but there were few buyers, leading to a decline. Futures prices all strengthened, and at one point, even the current month's 6 yuan US dollar was difficult to sell. Suddenly, the Banque de l'Indochine entered the market, aggressively buying (apparently from a certain party), and rumors spread that the European war was escalating, suggesting that exchange rates might fall again. This deterred sellers and instead spurred some operators to buy slightly, stabilizing the situation. By noon, the Banque de l'Indochine's willingness to buy had waned, and futures prices returned to their opening levels. The closing results were the same as the opening prices (with the combined British and American exchange rate at 3.56375 yuan), with the US dollar slightly firmer by 0.0625 compared to the previous day, while the British pound remained unchanged. The potential for futures differed slightly from the spot market.

Opening Saw Heavy Selling

In the morning, London's large cables fell by 1.875 for near-term and 2.5 for deferred. New York silver prices remained flat, and London gold was stable. Exchange rates for British pounds against US, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The US dollar against the British pound continued to rise by one point, remained unchanged against Shanghai, and rose by 1.25 against the French franc. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with a spot selling price of 4 pence and 125 for the British pound and 6.125 yuan for the US dollar, with the British pound flat and the US dollar firmer by 0.0625 compared to the previous close due to the increase in exchange rates. At the same time, futures opened with the British pound flat and the US dollar weaker by 0.0625. After opening, speculators came to sell futures, slightly weakening the market. Transactions included selling the current month's US dollar at 6 yuan and the May US dollar at 5.84375 yuan to the Banque de l'Indochine. At that time, foreign banks were mutually trading the current month's British pound at 4 pence and 0.0625. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was announced at a slightly lower one point. Afterward, the market remained weak. It was difficult to find buyers for the current month's futures exchange rate of 6 yuan. However, the Banque de l'Indochine seized the opportunity to come back and buy, taking in the current month's US dollar at 6 yuan from a certain bank. At the same time, rumors suddenly spread that the European war was escalating, and exchange rates were expected to fall, causing sellers to decrease and instead attracting a few buyers. Speculators bought the May US dollar at 5.8125 yuan from a foreign bank, and money exchange businesses bought the current month's US dollar at 6 yuan from the China-Italy Bank. The Banque de l'Indochine also bought the spot US dollar at 6.125 yuan from an American bank. At noon, American banks gradually reduced their willingness to sell, and futures prices gradually returned to their opening levels. By the close, the British pound was at 4 pence and 125, the US dollar at 6.125 yuan, the current month's British pound at 4 pence and 0.03125, the US dollar at 5.96875 yuan, and the May British pound at 3 pence and 921875, the US dollar at 5.8125 yuan. Both current and futures prices were the same as the morning opening. As a result, the current British pound was flat and the US dollar firmer by 0.0625 compared to the previous day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Hong Kong US Dollar Weakened

A cable from Hong Kong on the 3rd (Wednesday) reported that the foreign exchange market opened flat this morning, with the British pound unchanged. The spot US dollar weakened by 0.1875 to 22.0625 yuan, and the deferred rate was not opened. The spot Shanghai exchange rate fell by one to 359 yuan. The spot Japanese exchange rate also increased by one yuan to 93.5 yuan. At 11:30 AM, the market was flat, with no changes in any exchange rates. At 11:47 AM, the market was stable, with the spot Shanghai exchange rate rising by 0.5 yuan to 159.5 yuan. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Tianjin British Pound Unchanged

A cable from Tianjin on the 3rd (Wednesday) reported that the foreign exchange market opened firmer this morning, with the spot British pound and Shanghai exchange rate remaining unchanged. The spot US dollar weakened by 0.0625 to 5.8125 yuan, and the unofficial "Joint Note" rebounded by one yuan to 101.25 yuan.

### Gold Market Opens Weak, Quickly Rebounding

Although the cash gold market was affected by the environment yesterday, sentiment remained strong, resulting in a small decline of only 27 yuan. The market initially opened weak due to the increase in exchange rates and the weakening of the US dollar, immediately dropping by 60 yuan. Many sellers focused their attention, seeming to be waiting for something. Subsequently, rumors spread that futures prices were slightly firmer, leading to more selling and another 10 yuan drop. However, gold shops and money exchange businesses suddenly bought aggressively, pulling the price up to 5,480 yuan. Banks and securities firms occasionally sold, causing the price to fall back to 5,445 yuan. At noon, foreign exchange futures prices returned to their opening levels, boosting market sentiment. As a result, buyers actively purchased, pushing prices up step by step, reaching a high of 5,492 yuan. The market closed at 5,483 yuan. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. Approximately 2,000 taels or more were traded in the morning session. Gold jewelry prices initially fell but rebounded, while customs gold remained stable.

Cash Gold Continues to Fall by 27 Yuan

Since the morning opening, when exchange rates were reported higher by two points and the US dollar was firm, market sentiment was weak, with widespread selling. The market opened with a 60 yuan drop, with securities firms selling 20 taels to banks at 5,450 yuan. Shortly after, money exchange businesses sold, and foreign exchange futures prices slightly weakened, causing another 10 yuan drop. Gold shops sold 30 taels to money exchange businesses at 5,440 yuan. Subsequently, cash gold shops bought in at the lower price, and banks also bought in slightly. Furthermore, a certain gold shop bought aggressively, and sellers were momentarily silent, causing the price to rebound by 40 yuan. Money exchange businesses mutually traded 50 taels at 5,480 yuan. Subsequently, a certain securities firm sold long positions, and a money exchange business also showed a strong intention to sell. Many retail investors also followed suit, causing the price to fall again by 35 yuan. Securities firms sold 50 taels to gold shops at 5,445 yuan. Afterward, gold shops came back to buy in, stabilizing the market and rebounding by more than 10 yuan. After 11:00 AM, certain money exchange businesses and banks aggressively bought in, and foreign exchange futures prices were reported to have returned to their opening levels, causing the price to continue to rise by more than 30 yuan. Banks bought 30 taels from gold shops at 5,492 yuan. Later, banks sold again, causing the price to fall by 9 yuan. Banks mutually traded 10 taels at 5,483 yuan, the afternoon closing price. As a result, the price continued to fall by 27 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by 52 yuan and 10 cents during the morning session. The selling price of cash gold shops was several yuan higher than the "smelting red" price, while the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed price, with little activity.

Jewelry Prices Initially Fall, Then Rebound to Flat

The selling price of jewelry in silver shops initially remained at 555 yuan per tael among the major players. By 9:30 AM, the price was lowered by 5 yuan. At 11:50 AM, the price rebounded by 5 yuan. There were no further changes afterward. As a result, the major players still maintained a price of 555 yuan, with new players offering the same price. The buying price was reduced by about 15 yuan.

### US Dollar Bills Fluctuate

Yesterday's foreign bill market saw the supply of British and American gold pounds unchanged, and market prices continued to decline. The supply and demand of British gold bills remained balanced, and market prices remained stable. US dollar bills still fluctuated, eventually declining. The price initially fell to 16.31 yuan in the morning, and after opening, selling pressure increased, causing the price to fall to 16.23 yuan. The price rebounded after the fall, rising to 16.345 yuan. In the afternoon, the price declined again, eventually closing at 16.3 yuan. Hong Kong bills rose along with Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rates. Annam bills continued to be in demand, and market prices continued to rise. Philippine bills remained weak. The demand for Japanese gold bills increased sharply, and prices rose sharply, reaching 1.325 yuan in the evening. Korean bills followed suit, rising to 1.045 yuan in the evening. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold pounds each fall by 0.5 yuan, US dollar bills fall by 0.07 yuan, Hong Kong bills rise by 0.05 yuan, Annam bills rise by 0.03 yuan, Philippine bills fall by 0.05 yuan, and the rest remained unchanged.

### Discount Rate Falls by 4 Yuan

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange-drawn bills rebounded and fell, initially trading at 69 yuan per thousand in the morning, rising to 71 yuan at one point, but soon falling back to 66 yuan. There were no changes in the afternoon, remaining at 66 yuan, 4 yuan lower than the previous day. The clearing rate for the Money Industry Association was reported at 0.2 yuan for both morning and afternoon markets.

### Securities: Shift in Focus to Active Government Bonds

The securities market saw continued bullishness yesterday, with ample short-covering trades. Sentiment was generally positive, and rumors suggested that the financial sector was actively absorbing, which was within expectations given their current surplus. Furthermore, government bonds use exchange-drawn bills, which are not significantly correlated with tight or loose credit conditions. Consequently, some predicted that Category C bonds might break through the 50 yuan barrier. The most active buyers yesterday were De Fu, followed by Tian Sheng, Hong Da, Lian He Sheng Da, Mao Tai, Heng Fu, and Hu He Ji, all of whom saw considerable buying. The main sellers were Le Mao, along with Tong Kang, Tai Feng, Geng Xing, and retail investors, all of whom were selling. With demand exceeding supply, market prices rose by 0.12 to 0.4 yuan. Total turnover was approximately 1.3 million yuan. A summary table is listed below:

Category	Highest	Lowest	Closing	Change from Previous Day
Unified A	58.90	58.50	58.70	+0.30
Unified B	50.75	50.50	50.55	+0.15
Unified C	49.70	49.30	49.65	+0.40
Unified D	48.55	48.20	48.55	+0.40
Unified E	49.70	49.35	49.60	+0.35

For stock trading, 50 shares of China Trust were traded at a price of 10 yuan each. Due to residual selling pressure from the previous day, the stock market's opening trend was not strong. However, as buyers found it difficult to obtain desired shares at lower prices, they frequently increased their bids. The closing demand for all shares was good, and the market recovered strongly, washing away the sluggish atmosphere. Shanghai Silver, Jardine Matheson, and Public Motors shares, in particular, showed improvement.

China Coal Development shares were disappointing due to the company's recent announcement of only 60 cents of dividends for the end of the previous period. The opening price declined, reaching a low of 14 yuan. However, some realized that the dividend (including the previous dividend, totaling 1.2 yuan) was nominally for the entire year but was actually the operating profit after only half a year of work (as the company's mines were almost entirely consumed by mechanical equipment in the first few months of 1930 and were then hindered by heavy rain in the autumn). Consequently, prices rebounded, and buyers were present at 14.5 yuan at the close.

Rubber shares saw strong demand, with the Langkat share being particularly active due to rumors that it would announce excellent dividends.

The 21st Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of China Coal Development Co., Ltd. (Mentougou Coal Mine), managed by the British firm McBain & Co., will be held on April 26th. The final dividend for 1939 is proposed to be 60 cents, bringing the total dividend for the year to 1.2 yuan.

The Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of the British firm Hong Kong Security Insurance Co., Ltd. will be held in Hong Kong on May 3rd. The final dividend for 1939 is proposed to be 12 shillings and 6 pence.

The British firm Shanghai Enterprise Co., Ltd. recently decided at a board meeting to pay a dividend of 20 cents per share for 1939, with a remaining balance of over 10,000 yuan to be carried forward to the next period.

A cable from London on the 2nd (Tuesday) reported that the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and British Far East company stocks were stable today, and there were no changes in market prices.

### Grains: Rice Market Slightly Weakens

After a sharp decline and subsequent rebound, the rice market has been fluctuating. No. 1 Saigon rice has generally hovered around 44 to 45 yuan. Although it briefly reached a high of 46.5 yuan, it fell as soon as it rose. Yesterday, rumors spread in the market that the interior areas such as Jingwu, Changxi, and Sujia were about to be opened up and cleared for traffic to Shanghai, causing merchants to hesitate to engage in rash actions. Floating hoarders urgently sought to sell quickly, causing prices to fall by nearly one yuan. The downward trend intensified, and prices fell successively throughout the morning market, falling by about two yuan. No. 1 Saigon rice was only selling for 44 to 44.5 yuan, while meter-luh rice fell by about one yuan due to the smaller amount of goods available. Broken rice opened at 36 yuan, dropping to a low of 35 yuan, while meter-luh rice dropped from 37.5 yuan to 37 yuan, prompting bargain hunting. Prices briefly rebounded by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. However, sentiment was weak, and the rebound was short-lived. As a result, the prices of various foreign rice varieties fell by 1 to 2 yuan compared to the previous market. Although there was a large amount of glutinous rice available, the prices were close to those of broken rice due to repeated price drops, reaching a bottom, attracting inquiries. Sellers were unwilling to lower prices further, so prices remained stable with little change. Large and thin japonica rice and early and late indica rice saw increased activity in transit from Hongkou, with no fewer than 4,000 to 5,000 bags traded. In the unofficial market, it was reported that most cargo owners sought to quickly sell off their stocks, also lowering prices by more than one yuan. Kunshan japonica rice was priced at 45 to 46 yuan, medium rice at 44 yuan, special thin indica rice at 44 to 45 yuan, medium rice at 43 yuan, and Nanxiang early and late indica rice at 42 to 43 yuan, down to 41 yuan, etc.

Another large shipment of foreign rice arrived, transported directly from Saigon by the Wah Lun Shipping Company's Da Pu Lun, totaling 29,150 bags, arriving at the port around 6 PM on the 2nd (previous day), berthing at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou, and unloading operations commenced yesterday morning. The Italian ship Meng Tuo Pi Ana also transported a large amount of foreign rice from Saigon, expected to arrive tomorrow. The exact amount will be reported later.

The morning opening prices for foreign rice saw a sharp decline, as a large number of recent orders had arrived in Shanghai and were being sold off by Japanese merchants, further weakening sentiment. Spot foreign rice prices fell sharply by 2 yuan in the early market, but the market saw a slight improvement in actual sales, rebounding by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. However, sentiment remained weak, and futures prices also saw a sharp decline. April No. 1 Saigon rice was priced at 52 yuan, and No. 2 at 49.5 yuan, immediately dropping to 49 yuan with few buyers, or even 48.6 yuan for April delivery, or even 48.2 yuan for immediate delivery. Xiaojiao (short-grained) rice was as low as 48.5 yuan, and April Xiaojiao was as low as 49 yuan, falling by 1.5 to 1 yuan compared to the previous day's high price. Total futures volume was 375 tons, and spot rice volume was 4,500 bags.

In other news, it was recently learned that the "Da Chang Company" organization mentioned in a previous report has been formally established, with Mr. Yu as the organizer and most participants being well-funded grain merchants. It is the first time such a large capital has been used to operate in the grain business, and it is possible that it will control the city's food supply in the future. According to Mr. Fu, a leader in the rice industry, the production and sales cooperation issue being discussed by the concession authorities and the social affairs office is unrelated to this matter, as the former is private and the latter is for the welfare of the residents of the concession. (End)

### Flour Trading Slightly Active, Wheat Remains Sluggish

Yesterday's flour trading was slightly more active than before, with slight activity from local and inland merchants, as well as some involvement from merchant groups. However, the market saw increased supply, likely due to the 1 to 2 yuan drop in rice prices and the current dumping of miscellaneous Japanese brand flour in the market. Reportedly, the initial asking price for returned goods of the old Che brand was equal to the factory price, but the market price was only 13.72 yuan in the morning, a slight decrease from the previous day. However, green cannon car goods still required 15 yuan, Tianzhu brand also required 14 yuan, and Youlu brand required 13 yuan. Total transaction volume was estimated at 4,000 to 5,000 bags throughout the day. Local retail sales from factories were approximately 7,000 to 8,000 bags. It is estimated that 6,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Tianjin today (4th).

Wheat trading was very limited yesterday, and the market remained sluggish. Recently, domestic factories need to mix foreign wheat with local wheat, so their demand has not been low. However, they are still unwilling to raise prices, while those holding wheat are still unwilling to lower prices. As a result, Fuxin Factory purchased 1,000 bags of Changxi wheat at a price of 23.5 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans See Little Progress

The sales of soybeans were limited yesterday, and the overall situation was slow and stagnant. The market price for high-quality soybeans was stable, and the upper-middle-grade goods from the oil pressing factory and storage owners were selling. Local merchants inquired about the lower-grade goods. A total of 110 bags of Nanjing soybeans were sold at a price of 18.5 yuan, over 600 bags of Wuhu soybeans were sold at a price ranging from 20 yuan to 21.2 yuan, 5 carloads of Bengbu soybeans were sold at a price of 22.7 yuan and 22.5 yuan, 1 carload of Yangzhou Shanhuang was sold at a price of 19 yuan, over 100 bags of Dingjiazhou soybeans were sold at a price of 22 yuan, and 100 bags of Dalian mixed green soybeans were sold at a price of 20.05 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton: Southwest Yarn Continues Unabated

The yarn market initially fell and then rebounded, resulting in no significant changes from the previous day. However, sentiment remained enthusiastic, as Southwest China continued to demand Chinese yarn, so buyers actively absorbed 20-count Double Horse yarn, causing prices to rise as soon as they fell. However, foreign exchange rates have increased, and the overseas cotton market has weakened, with Indian cotton prices falling sharply, resulting in lower conversion prices. Considering the recent smooth operations of factories and the purchase of forward Indian cotton for forward yarn production, significant profits can be expected.

The morning opening of spot yarn saw continued increases in British and American exchange rates and sharp declines in Indian cotton, with relatively calm sentiment. The April price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,125 yuan. Subsequently, due to the decline in gold prices and the weakness of the US dollar, selling pressure increased slightly, causing the price to fall to 1,115 yuan. However, buyers returned to the market at the lower price, and the market slowly rebounded, rising to 1,145 yuan at the close. Afterwards, the market slightly weakened. The total transaction volume for the morning session was 2,610 bales. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 10 yuan. Shenxin Factory sold 1,500 bales of 20-count Double Horse yarn at prices ranging from 1,050 yuan to 1,065 yuan, and 150 bales of 32-count Double Horse yarn at a price of 1,455 yuan, all purchased by Cantonese merchants. 115 items were shipped to Tianjin on the 4th, and 145 items were shipped to Yantai. The purchase amounts by various merchant groups are listed below:

Local: 1,900; Hong Kong: 655; Inland: 55; Total: 2,610

### Indian Cotton Falling Sharply, Local Cotton Trading Still Quiet

Local cotton trading was still quiet. There were some mutual purchases and sales of foreign cotton among local merchants, but market demand was very weak, as the trend of foreign cotton continued to decline, and the price of Indian cotton was falling sharply, resulting in lower conversion prices. More than 500 bales of Supai sourced from Northern Jiangsu arrived. The current cotton transaction situation is listed below:

Mitterlin: 272.00 - 100 items purchased by local merchants
Also: 275.50 - 200 items purchased by local merchants
Oomra: 207.00 - 100 items purchased by local merchants
Bhiloch: 218.00 - 300 items purchased by Shenxin Factory
American Seed: 208.00 - 156 bales purchased by local merchants
Northern Thai: 205.00 - 300 bales purchased by local merchants
Lumiline: 270.00 - 100 items purchased by local merchants

In other news, the New York cotton market was weak again this morning, as the Liverpool telegraph reported a decline and the Mumbai telegraph reported another decline, causing great market anxiety. Also, some long positions were liquidated in the market, resulting in closing prices that were 6 to 7 pounds lower compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including high-efficiency, also fell by 7 rupees. The Egyptian market was closed.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading was weak due to the continued decline in the Indian cotton market, even though yarn prices continued to rise. Indian cotton previously ordered by merchants has now become high-priced. Also, as exchange rates slightly increased yesterday, various parties were eager to sell. However, factory purchases remained weak. The factory delivery prices, converted at a US exchange rate of 6.125, are listed below:

20-count: American Mitterlin 283.25
20-count: Also, Lower Grade 271.00
32-count: Also 299.20
32-count: Also, Lower Grade 288.70
42-count: Also 302.70
42-count: Also, Lower Grade 292.50

### Silk and Tea: New York Silk Prices Fall Sharply

Yesterday's foreign silk market in New York fell (Yokohama closed for a holiday). New York's near-term price fell by 0.19 yuan, and the deferred price fell by 0.22 yuan. There were no replies to telegrams sent from Shanghai the previous day. New artificial silk products have appeared in the New York market, and the patriotic American people will likely reduce their affection for genuine silk, so silk prices may continue to weaken in the near future.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Slightly Declines

According to a telegram from the Netherlands yesterday, sugar prices slightly declined by 0.1 yuan. The C.I.F.K.G. price for coarse white sugar was 8.65 Dutch guilders, causing the trend in the local market to weaken. The current price for coarse white sugar was 62.5 yuan for goods stored in Shanghai warehouses, down by 0.5 yuan; the price for newly arrived goods stored in foreign warehouses was 62.1 to 62.2 yuan, down by 0.8 yuan; and the price for old goods was 61.8 yuan, down by 0.6 yuan. Re-exported goods were 48.4 yuan, also down by 0.6 yuan. Taikoo refined white sugar prices were slightly lower by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The B mark on the west line was 68.8 yuan, the CW mark was 68.3 yuan, the CX mark was 67.8 yuan, the DY mark was 67.2 yuan, and the HX mark was 67 yuan. Goods stored in eastern warehouses were discounted. H mark military-use sugar was 49 yuan for new goods, 48 yuan for old goods, and 47 yuan for oil-packed goods. Dutch red sugar WA mark was 52 yuan, and re-exported sugar was 44 yuan. Local crystal sugar No. 1 was 74.5 yuan, No. 2 was 74 yuan, Crystal Bright Ice was 76 yuan, and Snow White was 62 yuan, all down by 0.5 yuan. For domestic sugar, only Guang Bang offered 82 packages of Xuanzhou ocean sugar at 56 yuan and 70 boxes of Qing sugar at 39 yuan.

### Northern and Southern Goods: High Price of Hanshang Celestial Rice

According to yesterday's dispatch from Hankou, Celestial Rice is extremely expensive, with Celestial Rice priced at 320 yuan and Celestial Rice flakes at 520 yuan.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Election: The British-American Front is Extremely Solid; Japanese Empty Threats Are of No Use; Those Who Have Not Paid Their Taxes Cannot Vote; The Mainland News Urges Foreign Voters to Rise Up in Unity

Since the Japanese side requested the Municipal Council to increase the number of Japanese directors, the Municipal Council has not agreed because the Land Regulations cannot be changed. The Japanese side has gone ahead and nominated as many as five Japanese candidates, intending to forcibly break the "gentleman's agreement" of five British, two American, and two Japanese directors and have the same number of directors as the British, thereby controlling the administration of the concession. In order to resist the Japanese intention, British and American taxpayers, in addition to adopting a united front with electors from other European and American communities to ensure that the British and American elected candidates receive more votes than the Japanese elected candidates, will also increase the number of British candidates by one. All parties, including the British, American, and Japanese sides, are working hard on the election campaign. The Japanese side is clamoring, even saying that the British side's increase of one candidate is an act of provocation. It can be said that the conflict of interest between the British and Japanese sides is the most intense. The Japanese semi-official organ, the Mainland News, even used threatening words against the Public Concession in yesterday's editorial, saying that if this election does not achieve its goal, the Japanese army will take action within the possible range. It also said that all groups that prevent the Japanese from making this progress should be prepared to take full responsibility for the consequences. It can be said that they are using every possible means, and the seriousness and tension of the situation can be imagined. The developments of yesterday are recorded below,

Japanese Threats and Inducements to Jews

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that the Municipal Council election is about to be held. Japanese lobbyists are now using "permission for relatives of Jewish immigrants to enter Shanghai" as bait to induce European Jews on the north bank of Suzhou Creek to elect five Japanese candidates. The Japanese have already set up a campaign office on Zhao Feng Road, with two Japanese and four Jewish refugees from Germany assisting in the work, doing their best to win the minority electorate in order to increase the number of Japanese directors on the Municipal Council to five.

British and American Residents Do Not Vote for Japanese

However, most of the German-Jewish residents with voting rights live on the south bank of Suzhou Creek and are not tempted by Japanese pressure. Only half of the German residents in Shanghai with voting rights are National Socialist Party members. In previous years, most of the British and American residents with voting rights elected British, American, and Japanese candidates. However, this year, the British resident Zhu Bifu elected the Japanese and will elect five British candidates and the extra candidate McDonald, as well as two American candidates. Therefore, it is even possible to reduce the number of Japanese directors to one.

Paying Taxes is Required to Vote

As for the voting time, it will be held on the 10th and 11th from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM at the Shanghai Volunteer Corps drill hall and the Hongkou Small Vegetable Market, as usual. Currently, British, American, and Japanese residents are very active, vying for the electorate of minorities and inquiring whether taxpayers of their own nationality have paid their taxes, because taxpayers who have not paid their taxes will not be able to obtain the voting certificate necessary to go to the polling place. It is heard that the ballot counters who open the ballot boxes and count the votes can freely obtain several assistants to assist in the counting, because the election ballots are not counted by Municipal Council officials.

The Japanese Attitude is Very Arrogant

The Japanese semi-official organ, the Mainland News, even issued a threat to the Public Concession in yesterday's editorial, saying, "If the Japanese side cannot obtain a greater representation in the Municipal Council this time, the Japanese army will take action within the possible range to obtain control of the Public Concession. If such a 'reasonable' demand of the Japanese is unfortunately despised by the Western residents, and the 'dictatorship' of the British over the concession continues, then the Japanese side will abandon its 'legal procedure' and replace it with other means. If the situation after this is as described above, the situation in the concession will return to a state of chaos." The newspaper also warned various groups, saying, "All groups that prevent the Japanese from making this progress should be prepared to take full responsibility for the consequences." The newspaper further stated, "When the issue of the Public Concession was discussed last year, some people accused the Public Concession of being a base for the 'anti-Japanese movement' and suggested that the Japanese should resolve the issue of the concession with force, making it a part of the Japanese military's jurisdiction. But to our knowledge, the result of the concession issue has already been resolved 'legally,' because the cross-border road construction police agreement and the Hongkou district agreement have already been signed by both sides."

The Current Situation Cannot Be Estimated

According to foreign observations, the Japanese suddenly announcing that the number of candidates has increased to as many as five this time will shake the foundations of the Public Concession, which have never changed in the past seventy years. In the past decade, the proportion of five British, two American, and two Japanese directors on the Public Concession Municipal Council will shake for the first time. If the Japanese side achieves its goal this time, the British and Americans will only get the remaining four seats. In comparison, although the British influence is stronger than the American influence, it is currently impossible for the general public to predict how the distribution will be.

German and Russian Residents are of Utmost Importance

Among the foreign groups that are most important in this election are the German and Russian residents in Shanghai. There are about 700 German taxpayers, including Germans and German-Jewish refugees. Most of the German-Jewish refugees live in the northern district of Suzhou Creek, which is controlled by the Japanese. Regardless of whether the Germans fully support the British and American candidates, it is estimated that at least 400 Jewish refugees will vote for the Japanese candidates. As mentioned above, the attitude of the 450 Russian taxpayers in this port, whether they live south or north of the bridge, can be known. In addition, there are 100 Germans and 100 Portuguese living in the Public Concession, who may support the British and American side, but the 90 Italian residents and 12 Spanish residents are afraid that they will support the Japanese because of the so-called "Anti-Comintern Pact." The 24 Dutch residents and about 300 residents from other countries may support the British and American side. Based on the estimated number of votes that both sides can win, if all voters can maintain 85 percent of the votes being valid (excluding Germans and Russians), the British and American side can obtain an equal number of votes with the Japanese. Yesterday, according to reliable sources, it was claimed that the Japanese will intensify their protests against the matter of fighting for votes before the election, but they believe that if the Japanese have indeed done so, the Japanese residents in the northern district of the bridge must first pay the taxes they owe.

British Candidate Declares His Attitude

The British independent candidate, Shanghai's famous lawyer, Reynolds MacDonald, made a statement to Western reporters yesterday, saying, "I am a British candidate, but not one of the five. I am a 'superman,' but if I am elected in this election, I would be very willing to call myself a 'Shanghaier.' The reason why I call myself 'transcendent' is because I do not belong to any one side or any one group, so I do not want to be a 'servant' of any one side or one group. I am willing to serve the entire Shanghai society and am willing to fight with unwavering spirit to win the happiness of all citizens, regardless of their nationality. I am a democrat and believe that there should be a democratic administrative body in Shanghai. I am willing to represent a government that is completely 'of the people, by the people, and for the people.' I am willing to make the affairs of the Municipal Council completely open, wash away the accumulated bad habits, and make the citizens feel that there are no dark corners in the various systems of the Municipal Council. I am willing to completely change the current situation, especially to improve the unequal land regulations. If I am elected, I will fight for the most possible economic savings methods until the economic situation of the Public Concession is on a sound foundation." According to reports, the Japanese candidates have long expressed their firm opposition to the Municipal Council's proposed increase of 50 percent in municipal rates. The resolution of this matter will probably be decided at the Western Taxpayers' Annual Meeting to be held on the 17th of this month, but the Japanese side has not yet expressed any specific methods.

### Foreign Nationals Unite

This Election Is Extremely Important

The Ta Lu Bao (Mainland News) yesterday published an editorial titled "The Position of the Shanghai International Settlement," stating that the Japanese Residents Election Committee has nominated five candidates to run for seats on the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC). This action has made the issue of this year's election concrete. The only question to be decided in the election on the 10th and 11th of this month is whether the political status and international character of the Shanghai International Settlement will be changed.

Continuous Provocation Without End

Since August 1937, the Japanese have been exerting various pressures on the International Settlement, using their military force to threaten the neutrality and security of the Settlement, constantly exploiting oppressive diplomacy to undermine the Settlement's sovereignty and internationality, and encouraged by illegal actions, they have repeatedly challenged the ability of the SMC to govern its jurisdiction. This election is their latest provocation, which must be met and defeated by the ratepayers of the International Settlement alone.

Striving Through Own Election Campaign

The Japanese side's current election campaign is vastly different from their past attempts to control the International Settlement. It cannot be prevented by the diplomatic actions of third countries. Therefore, the ratepayers of the International Settlement must not rely on foreign assistance but fight in the upcoming election. If the International Settlement and non-Japanese foreign residents lose in this election challenge from the Japanese, it will not be because the British and American governments are unwilling to help the SMC, nor will it be due to the much-criticized appeasement policy of the SMC, but rather it will be entirely the fault of the muddleheadedness of the foreign ratepayers in Shanghai.

British and American Governments Cannot Help

In the past, when residents of this city fought against external forces, they always relied too much on the actions of third countries with interests in the International Settlement. When the Japanese sought to control the International Settlement through threats, diplomatic pressure, and military force, the ratepayers remained calm, hoping for action from Washington and London, believing that the British and American governments would surely rescue Shanghai from its troubles. However, the current situation is different. Although Britain and America are willing to protect the International Settlement, they cannot help shift the outcome of the vote on the 10th and 11th of this month. If non-Japanese foreign residents abstain from voting or fail to cast the full amount of votes necessary to defeat the Japanese, then the Japanese in Shanghai will legally have the right to control the International Settlement, and the SMC board will also become a Japanese group.

Japanese Statements Deserve Attention

The election platform announced by Hayashi Yuukichi, Chairman of the Japanese Residents Election Committee, deserves the attention of the city's ratepayers. Hayashi stated, "The purpose of the Japanese is to eliminate the monopoly of municipal affairs by any particular group of foreigners, so that the administration of the International Settlement can be conducted in a truly international state." This kind of election platform, expressed in diplomatic language, reveals its true meaning at a glance: the Japanese aim to eliminate the current monopoly system and replace it with a Japanese monopoly, and to change the current international character into a purely Japanese administrative organization.

Foreign Voters Must Rise Up Together

From the perspective of Shanghai's future, the importance of the election on the 10th and 11th of this month cannot be overstated. Whether the International Settlement becomes a suburb of Tokyo will depend on the outcome of the election. Whether the city's foreign residents will continue to be managed by themselves or ruled by the Japanese municipal authorities will depend on the voting ability of the non-Japanese foreign residents. As mentioned above, these issues are not decided in Washington or London, but determined by the voters of the International Settlement. The difference between maintaining the international status of the International Settlement and the Japanization of Shanghai depends entirely on whether the voters will cast their votes.

### The SMC Spends 5,000 Taels of Gold on Decorating the Director-General's Office; Western Staff Are Dismissed and Replaced by Jews

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that while the SMC seeks to economize by dismissing Western staff, it has now spent 5,000 yuan to decorate the Director-General's office. This is the second time 5,000 yuan has been spent on decorating Mr. Stirling Fessenden's office within a year, as the office was also renovated when Fessenden retired. In addition, Mr. Cale, head of the Parks and Open Spaces Department of the Public Works Department, who has served the SMC for 17 years, recently received a dismissal notice and left his post on the 31st of last month, to be replaced by European immigrants hired by the SMC at low wages. Furthermore, four Jewish immigrants, who entered the Public Works Department's automobile factory six months ago to study under motor engineer Mr. White, now Mr. White has also

### Taiping in Anhui Suffers Horrific Bombing by Japanese Aircraft; News Received in Shanghai

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that news has been received in Shanghai that from 8:00 AM on the 19th of last month, Japanese aircraft bombed Taiping in Anhui for four consecutive hours until noon, destroying houses and causing many civilian casualties. The buildings of the American mission in the area were also destroyed, and the caretaker was killed. Taiping is located on the highway from Tunxi to Guichi in southern Anhui. Although it is not far from the war zone, it has never been threatened by modern warfare. The Japanese-occupied Xuancheng is the closest to the area, but the Japanese army is advancing along the south bank of the Yangtze River, attempting to seize Qingyang in order to drive away the mobile artillery units bombarding Japanese warships. The bombing of Taiping on March 19th is likely a scene from a new military operation.

### Ningbo Natives in Shanghai Organize to Relieve the Rice Shortage in Sanbei

Ningbo natives in Shanghai initiated the organization of the Sanbei Ningbo Native Relief Committee to raise funds to provide food for their hometowns. They plan to raise funds to purchase rice and sell it at reasonable prices. After the first meeting, 50 committee members were selected, stipulating that each person must raise at least 2,000 yuan. Yu Qiaqing was elected as the chairman, and Shen Weiting and Fan Chufeng were elected as vice-chairmen. The commander of the fundraising team is Yu Qiaqing, with five vice-commanders. Five economic committee members were appointed, and donation collection points were designated as: (1) Shipping Association, (2) Tobacco Exchange Association, (3) Huacheng Company, (4) Dacheng Company, (5) Ji Ji Tobacco Shop. The fundraising period is limited to one month starting immediately. The meeting place was decided to be at the Ningbo Road Tobacco Exchange Association. They plan to purchase 20,000 bags of Saigon rice and resolved to ask Yu Qiaqing to arrange for telegraphic purchase. It was decided that Yu Qiaqing would temporarily advance 100,000 yuan for the rice purchase.

### Company Commander Executed for Ineffective Resistance; Six Deputies Shot Dead

Gu Fusheng, commander of the Qingpu County Guerrilla Force and commander of the Third Detachment, has reportedly received secret information that Zhang Taosheng, company commander of the Third Company under his command, along with deputy Zhu Xilin, district commander Xu Xiaomei, platoon leader Xi Adi, and orderly Zhang Shunsheng, a total of seven people, were stationed on the Qinghu Road but had failed to achieve any results. Moreover, they had recently been ineffective in resisting the enemy. Commander Gu was furious upon receiving the report and summoned Zhang Taosheng and the other seven to headquarters for a reprimand. Consequently, the company commander Zhang Taosheng was executed by beheading at Wangjiatang the night before, and the remaining six, including deputy Zhu Xilin, were all executed by firing squad as a warning.

### Increased Taxes Are Difficult to Recover; The Hotel Industry Increases Prices; Water, Electricity, and Fuel Costs Increase Simultaneously; A Temporary Increase of 40% Starting This Month

The Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement is scheduled to increase license taxes for the hotel business starting April 1st. The Hotel Industry Association believes that if taxes are increased again at a time of rising prices, it will be impossible to operate. They have sent separate letters to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the International Settlement and entertained all the Chinese directors, asking the SMC to withdraw the order or reduce the tax amount. Although the Bureau briefly considered reviewing the files, a reporter from Xin Sheng She (New Voice News Agency) learned that the Hotel Industry Association received news from the Chinese directors yesterday that it is difficult to withdraw the order for the tax increase. If they wait for the situation to change and the hotel business to be light, they will reduce the tax amount to ease the burden on taxpayers. The Hotel Industry Association stated that it would be difficult to protest this measure by the SMC again. Therefore, some large and small hotels have officially announced price increases. Their notice states: "To whom it may concern, the prices of fuel, water, and electricity in Shanghai are soaring endlessly. In addition, there has recently been an increase in hotel taxes. Therefore, we will temporarily add 40% to the original price starting April 1st as a compensation. We hereby announce this and hope for your understanding."

### Current Rice Prices Are Still Difficult to Bear; Discuss Continuing to Run Grain Shops; There Is Talk of Lifting the Ban on Domestic Rice Being Transported to Shanghai

Since the authorities of the two settlements, the Soybean Industry Association, the Rice Industry Tea Party Market, and others have been paying close attention to the attempts of speculators to manipulate the rice market and raise rice prices, the rice market has become slightly more stable yesterday. In addition, after the Rice Industry Tea Party Market opened yesterday, it was rumored that a large amount of domestic rice would be transported to Shanghai, so the prices of various types of rice fell by one to two yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). The reason why the Japanese puppet government previously blocked the transportation of domestic rice to Shanghai was to threaten the residents of the settlements, but fortunately, a large amount of foreign rice was supplied, which did not fulfill their wish. Moreover, blocking the transportation of domestic rice and tax revenue has greatly hindered them, so there is talk of lifting the ban on domestic rice to increase tax revenue.

Continuing to Run Grain Shops Is Urgently Awaiting Discussion

The Shanghai Pingjiao (Fair Price) Committee announced: "Since the establishment of this committee, three months have passed in a blink of an eye. In the midst of all difficulties, we have maintained the livelihoods of ordinary people, and they have been able to obtain food without difficulty. All this is due to the cooperation of our colleagues. Although we have done our duty, we cannot boast about it. However, we can be happy that we have acted tirelessly. Now that the third phase of the grain sales is about to expire on April 7th, our comrades have worked hard together and are deeply exhausted, and the donations we have received are also coming to an end. We have temporarily planned to stop selling grain and make a small conclusion. However, after investigating the price of rice, it is difficult to enable ordinary people to afford it immediately, and the facts are clear to all. In this case, it is not appropriate to interrupt the matter, otherwise it will be incomplete. Regardless of whether it is ridiculed, can we be at peace with ourselves? Poverty still exists, and a gentleman does not abandon the old. Whether to continue the grain sales is urgently in need of consultation. We have scheduled a general committee meeting to be held at the Shipping Club on the fourth floor of 93 Guangdong Road at 2:00 PM on April 6th (Saturday) to discuss the matter."

### The Pseudo "Central Market" Is Again Controlling the Transportation of Local Goods; The Number of Seized Local Goods Has Gradually Increased; The Branch Market in Western Shanghai Will Also Open Tomorrow

The pseudo "Central Market" and the two branch "markets" in Baiteli Nan Road and Nanshi in western Shanghai were originally scheduled to open simultaneously the day before yesterday. However, due to insufficient distribution of seized goods, only the "Central Market" opened. Now the seizure of local goods has gradually increased, so the Baiteli Nan Road branch "market" has decided to open tomorrow. As for the Nanshi branch "market", the opening plan has been postponed indefinitely. The details are as follows:

Knowing That It Is Onerous, Precautions Are Strict

After the pseudo "Central Market" was established, it stepped up the interception of local goods transported to Shanghai, resulting in a gradual scarcity of local goods sources in the market, except for those secretly transported to Shanghai by villagers. Merchants had no choice but to purchase local goods from the "market", and use coolies to go to the "market" to transport them back. However, the "market" clearly knows that it is exploiting the common people, so it is extremely careful in its precautions. It stipulates that vendors who purchase goods must obtain an "entry and exit permit" before they can enter and exit, but the coolies hired by general local goods merchants do not have this "permit". Fearing accidents, it notified the local goods merchants yesterday and posted a notice in front of the gate that from now on, all coolies from outside are strictly prohibited from entering.

Even Transportation Vehicles Are Package-Dealt

Since the "market" controlled the local goods in the city, knowing that general local goods merchants would be forced to purchase from the "market", the trucking business must be prosperous. Therefore, the "market" gathered more than a dozen transport trucks and organized a "Central Transport Company" to control the transportation of local goods throughout the city. However, the "company" found that many local goods merchants hired their own vehicles to directly enter the "market" for loading and transportation, which affected its business. Therefore, it posted a notice yesterday that in the future, local goods merchants who want to hire transport trucks and workers to transport local goods must contact the "company", otherwise they will not be allowed to enter. The livelihoods of the city's transportation industry and general workers are also suffering from its attack.

The Branch "Market" in Western Shanghai Will Open Tomorrow

The pseudo "Central Market Branch Market" on Baiteli Nan Road in western Shanghai was originally scheduled to open on the same day as the "Central Market". However, because there were not many local goods seized at that time, if one place opened at the same time, it would not be enough to distribute. Therefore, only the "Central Market" opened first. Now that the Japanese puppet government has stepped up its interception in the suburbs, the seizure of local goods has gradually increased. Therefore, the Baiteli Nan Road branch "market" has decided to officially open tomorrow. As for the Nanshi branch "market", although it has repeatedly requested the French Concession authorities to open the iron gates of the 16th Pier, there has been no result, so the opening plan has been postponed indefinitely.

### British Ships Reduce Sailings in the Lower Yangtze River; Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire Reduce Schedules; Chinese Ships Forced to Fly the Japanese Flag

Since Japanese shipping companies joined the Lower Yangtze River route, passenger and cargo traffic has been completely controlled, causing foreign shipping companies to have no cargo to load. Several ships have changed to other routes one after another. It has been learned that since the Sino-Japanese war, the Jiangyin River surface has been blocked, so the British companies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire have changed to the Lower Yangtze River. The original four ships, Tonghe, Yihe, Wuhu, and Datong, have recently been changed to fly the Japanese flag by the Japanese, and all passenger and cargo traffic in various ports is monopolized by their ships. Moreover, the two major cargo transports, cotton and grain, cannot be exported, so the shipping business is greatly affected. Now the two companies' ships, Tonghe and Wulin, are changed to run one ship per week for rotation, so as to merely embellish shipping rights.

### A Kidnapping Occurred in the French Concession Last Night; The Kidnapped Person Was Ge Liquan From Taizhou; The Owner of a Tobacco Shop Was Injured by a Stray Bullet

At 9:40 last night, a kidnapping of a Taizhou merchant occurred on Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession. At that time, it was detected by the local patrolman, and the two sides exchanged fire. As a result, the merchant was eventually taken away, and a stray bullet injured the owner of a tobacco shop. The details are recorded below:

Private Lodging

Ge Liquan, a native of Taizhou, 45 years old, resides at No. 3 Luban Lane, Luban Road, French Concession, Shanghai. The residence is attached with the "Taizhou Bang Shipping Merchants' Shanghai Office". Ge suddenly rented Room 218 on the second floor of the Xinxinxiangji Inn at No. 114 Zhengjia Muqiao Street on November 1st of last year, carrying a young woman and a young man. According to Ge, the young woman is his wife, and the young man is his nephew.

A Sudden Arrival of Four People

At around 9:30 last night, a person resembling a certain foreigner led three Chinese men in Western suits, riding in a private car, directly to the entrance of the Xinxinxiangji Inn. After the four got out of the car, one with a figure eight mustache and a dark complexion was left at the entrance to keep watch, while the remaining three rushed in, went straight to the second floor, and broke into Room 218. At that time, Ge was chatting with his wife and nephew in the room. As soon as the three saw Ge, two of them took out handguns and prohibited them from making a sound.

Ge Was Taken Away

At that time, Ge knew that it was difficult to resist, and was dragged out of the room by the three. When they reached the stairs on the second floor, the three pushed Ge down the stairs. At that time, Ge fainted and fell to the ground. The three followed down the stairs and, together with the person standing at the entrance to keep watch, lifted Ge up, squeezed him into the car that the bandits had ridden in, and drove off at full speed, heading north through Gongguan Road and all the way away.

Car Number

At that time, a patrolman happened to be standing there. When he first saw that the symbol on the bandits' car was a white circle with the number 247 in it, he became suspicious. The patrolman knew that this type of car number was used by the military vehicles of a certain country, so he paid attention to it. When he saw four people carrying someone into the car together from the inn, he knew that something was wrong. He wanted to rush forward and order them to stop, but the car had already sped away.

Exchanging Gunfire

The patrolman chased after the car, shouting and pulling out his gun. At the intersection of Ningxing Street and Zhengjia Muqiao Street, the bandits in the car opened fire to resist arrest. The patrolman also returned fire, and the two sides exchanged four or five shots. In the end, because it was night and the patrolman was alone and weak, he was escaped. He watched the bandits' car drive towards Edward Road and disappear in an instant.

Injured by Stray Bullet

At the same time, the McClellan Police Station also heard the alarm and sent a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene. Unfortunately, the bandits had already fled far away. They returned to the Xinxinxiangji Inn to investigate. When the bandits opened fire to resist arrest, Luo Baozhong (51 years old), the boss of the Yongfengtai Tobacco Shop at No. 84 Ningxing Street (i.e., the northwest corner of Zhengjia Muqiao Street and the intersection of Zhengjia Muqiao Street and the Fourth Road), was hit by a stray bullet while packing up to close for the night. The bullet entered from the cheekbone next to the right nose and did not penetrate. He was sent to Renji Hospital. It is said that the injury is not serious. However, it is said that the French Police Department attaches great importance to this case and is currently conducting a thorough investigation.

### A Small Ship From the Lu Lin Foreign Firm Collided With a Sailing Boat; The Boat Owner Is Claiming More Than 10,000 Taels of Gold; The Two Sides Are Negotiating

The Dalu Bao (Mainland News) reports that the small ship Kang Taier (245 tons) of the German firm Lu Lin Foreign Firm collided with a sailing boat heading to Shanghai outside of Wusong on the evening of the 31st of last month. The sailing boat sank immediately. All eleven people on board were rescued by Customs Steamer No. 302. The boat owner demanded 10,500 yuan in compensation from the Lu Lin Foreign Firm. It is said that the two sides are negotiating. If a solution cannot be reached, litigation may be initiated. According to reliable sources, the boat owner purchased the sailing boat about two years ago for 7,000 yuan, and then spent 1,500 yuan to repair it and about 1,000 yuan to purchase equipment. The iron anchor was worth 200 yuan. When it sank, the boat was carrying sand worth 1,200 yuan. The Kang Taier was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 1st, but due to the collision with the sailing boat, it did not arrive in port until 9:00 PM on the night of the 1st and berthed at Buoy No. 4.

### After 33 Years in China, Gauss Returned to the United States Yesterday; U.S. Navy Honor Guard Played Music to Pay Respects; Chinese and Foreign Dignitaries All Came to the Wharf to See Him Off

The newly appointed US Minister to Australia, Gauss, left for the United States last night. Gauss left Shanghai at 4:45 pm. The honor guard of the US Navy Mackling team went to the Customs Wharf to play music to see him off. In addition, those who went to the wharf to see him off included British Consul General in Shanghai George, Japanese Consul General Miura, US Customs Commissioner Hielmik, SMC Director General Fankling, Australian Commercial Representative in China Bowton, SMC Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing, etc. Gauss shook hands with each person, and then, in the melodious music of the US Yangtze River Fleet, bid farewell by waving his hat to the shore with US Yangtze River Fleet Commander Grasefford, and sailed away. This old friend of China said goodbye to this familiar city.

A Brief Stay in Washington

Gauss will leave port on the Tiger President this morning at 1:00 AM. After arriving in the United States, he will stay with his family on Balboa Island for three weeks, and then go to Washington to report to President Roosevelt and take the oath of office. Gauss hopes to stay in Washington for a month, as Washington is Gauss's hometown.

Served in China for 33 Years

He was born there on January 12, 1887. He also studied law in Washington. In 1906, Gauss was recommended to serve in the government, as the secretary of Deng Pei, an expert on Far Eastern affairs. In 1909, when Deng Pei was transferred to Shanghai as Consul General, Gauss was called to accompany him, but Gauss returned to Washington in the same year to continue his studies and prepare for the national diplomatic examination. However, Gauss did not retire and continued to serve in the national diplomatic service. In 1913, he returned to Shanghai as Vice Consul. Since then, Gauss has repeatedly served as Consul in Tianjin, Shenyang, Jinan, Shanghai, etc. In 1931, Gauss was recalled to Washington, and Gauss served in the Department of Far Eastern Affairs when the September 18th Incident occurred. On February 3, 1917, Gauss married Miss Louise from California. In November 1918, his wife gave birth to a son in Los Angeles, named Pike Gauss. In 1933, Gauss first took office in Peiping, and in 1934 he was transferred to Paris to serve in the embassy. In 1936, he returned to Shanghai to serve as Consul General, for five years. He has served in China for 33 years, so all parties call him a friend of China. As for the issue of the new consul's selection, the US government has not yet made any announcement.

### Japanese Police Officers in the SMC Resign in Protest

The Japanese are trying to control the police power of the settlement and are willing to use various methods. One Anchuan Shixiong was originally the director of the Japanese team of the traffic section of the SMC. Recently, he made four demands to Mr. Baker, the head of the traffic section: (1) expand the authority of the Japanese team of the traffic section and allow it to be independent; (2) remove the subordinate status of the Japanese team to the Westerners; (3) expand the use of the Japanese team police; (4) the treatment of the Japanese team police must be equal to that of the Westerners. This opinion was completely rejected by Baker. The Anchuan Shixiong submitted his resignation on the afternoon of the 2nd as a threat.

### Litigation Case of Refusing to Compensate for Losses in the Battle of Shanghai; Huadong Company Sues American Insurance Company

American Customs Commissioner Asks Philippe to Testify; The Dalu Bao (Mainland News) reports that Huadong Electrical Appliance Company at No. 959 Zhoujiazui Road suffered significant losses during the Battle of Shanghai in 1937. However, the company had war risk insurance with the American Family Insurance Company, so it requested compensation of US$27,160.75. The Family Company argued that Huadong Company was slightly damaged during the war and that its machines had been transported to the south side of the Suzhou River before the war.

Refused to Compensate

Huadong Company filed a lawsuit with the US Customs Commissioner's Office in China. The US Customs Commissioner's Office has held several trials. The retrial was held on the 2nd and asked Philippe, the General Manager and Director of the SMC, to appear in court to testify on the extent to which the SMC has jurisdiction over the northern district of the Public Concession. The Family Company's lawyer Nelson asked whether the SMC's recent agreement with the Japanese side on the Northern District

Police Agreement

Has taken effect. Philippe replied that this question was difficult to answer, but the two sides had reached "some compromises." Philippe replied to another question that after the Japanese occupied the northern and eastern districts of the Public Concession, they soon promulgated traffic regulations in the area and sent sentries to the bridges on the Suzhou River to prevent people from traveling north from the south bank. The Japanese did not consult the SMC for both of these actions, but

British Troops in This City

Did not consult the SMC either, and sent British sentries to the bridges on the Suzhou River. Nelson asked whether the SMC protested when the Japanese bus company took over the British bus routes in the northern district. Philippe replied that this issue was not public in nature and that he did not intend to answer. At this point, Nelson presented the bureau's protest on the matter. Philippe then said that he recalled that in 1938

Protested

The Japanese bus company is still infringing on the British bus company's privileges in the northern district. Later, Mr. Hoden, the Chief Patrol Officer of the SMC Police Department, testified that since 1938, the Japanese Residents Group had instructed their employees to plunder in Yangshupu. At that time, he was working at the Yulin Road Police Station and witnessed the Japanese Residents Group

Transporting Scrap Iron

To Japan must be countless times. The police station protested to the commander of the Japanese Navy Landing Force barracks on Huacheng Road. The commander replied that the Japanese Residents Group had a "permit to clear the area." The Japanese had all obtained permits specifying the names of certain roads, and that all objects in between were Japanese property. Mr. Ju Kesilin, a reporter for Tzu Bao (Word News), testified that he was

Taking Pictures in the Northern District

In January 1938, he saw Japanese people and Chinese coolies loading iron into trucks. He remembered seeing the Japanese looting scrap iron near Huadong Company on Zhoujiazui Road. Previously, when the case was heard, other witnesses testified that the Japanese Navy Landing Force had systematically plundered in the eastern and northern districts at the end of 1937. Nelson, the lawyer for the Family Company, argued that the removal of Huadong Company's machines, etc., was ordered by the military authorities controlling the area, so it was not covered by the "plunder" clause of the war risk insurance.

### Accusation of Negligence Against the Head of Surgery at Bao Long Hospital: Surgical Incision for Chest Discomfort Proves Fatal; Xie Jia-shu Denies Negligence, Claiming Incurable Disease; Case Requires Summoning Witnesses, Plaintiff Requests Exhumation for Autopsy

Xie Jia-shu, the head of surgery at Bao Long Hospital on Baker Road (age 29, from Songjiang, a graduate of Tongji University Medical School), was recently sued in the First Special District Court by Hui Zhu Shu-xiang, a woman residing at 572 Yu Qiaqing Road, through lawyers Cai Zhi-su and Weng Wei-xian. She accused Xie of causing the death of her husband, Hui Ming-zhi (age 39, from Yixing, an employee in the confectionery department of the New World Company), due to negligence, and requested that he be punished according to Article 276 of the Criminal Law. According to Hui Zhu's statement and her lawsuit, her late husband, Hui Ming-zhi, had always been in good health but suddenly experienced chest

occasional discomfort

around December of last year in the lunar calendar. However, because his appetite was strong and his spirits remained high, they did not suspect anything else. But on February 17th in the Gregorian calendar, Hui Ming-zhi passed by Bao Long Hospital on Baker Road and decided to go in to ask about the cause of his chest discomfort. The hospital ordered him to be admitted for observation and requested a deposit of one hundred yuan for hospitalization. Hui raised the funds and paid the fee, being admitted to the hospital that day. He was subsequently examined by the defendant, Xie Jia-shu. On the 31st, Xie stated that surgery was necessary. Both Hui and his wife expressed opposition and

asked about the cause of the illness.

According to Xie, the cause could not be determined without surgery, and he insisted on performing the operation. Eventually, the surgery was performed. On the 26th, Hui's wound suddenly bled profusely. His wife requested that he be given an injection to stop the bleeding. However, the doctor demanded a fee of ten yuan for the injection before administering it. After she went out to raise the ten yuan and paid it, a hemostatic injection was finally given. However, a significant amount of time had passed, and the excessive bleeding led to his death. Hui believes that her husband's death was due to Xie Jia-shu's professional negligence, disregarding human life and using her husband as an

experimental sacrifice.

Therefore, she filed a lawsuit. Yesterday morning, this case was heard in the Third Criminal Court by Judge Liu Yu-gui. According to Xie Jia-shu's testimony, the deceased suffered from liver cancer, which is an incurable disease. Even without surgery, there was no hope. After the surgery, it was discovered that the entire area had become cancerous, so no surgery was performed, and the incision was sewn up. He also stated that the surgery was performed by the hospital director, Dr. Bai De, himself, with Xie assisting. The deceased also

signed a consent form.

The signed form was presented to the court. Hui Zhu Shu-xiang, after reviewing the signed form in court, claimed that it was a forgery and that her late husband's handwriting could be verified. She also stated that her husband had requested an X-ray to determine the cause of the illness upon admission, but the defendant did not comply and rashly performed surgery. The court stated that the matter still required the summoning of witnesses and adjourned the hearing for one week. The plaintiff's lawyer, in order to clarify the facts, requested an exhumation for examination. The court stated that the request would be considered.

### Exchange of Two Prosecutors

Zhao Chang-min, prosecutor of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, and Wang Ren, prosecutor of the Second Special District Court, have been ordered by their superiors to exchange offices. After receiving the order, both Zhao and Wang completed the handover of case files yesterday and went to their new posts.

### Fine for Copyright Infringement

During the spring sales of textbooks from the Zheng Zhong Bookstore on Fourth Avenue, pirated books suddenly appeared on the market. It was found that these pirated books were reproduced using photographic printing, resulting in blurry characters, unclear outlines, poor paper quality, and insufficient size. In order to protect the convenience of readers and safeguard its own legal rights, the bookstore sent people to investigate. They discovered the sale of pirated books such as "Junior High School Chinese Culture" in the Modern Bookstore in the French Concession. After the discovery, the bookstore hired someone to mediate, voluntarily compensated for the losses, and published statements of apology in the Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers, promising not to sell them again. At the same time, pirated books such as "Junior High School Geometry Algebra" were also found being sold at the Xie He Bookstore, Wen De Bookstore, and Lian Yi Bookstore in the British Concession. The Aihong Road police station filed a public prosecution with the Special District Court, and Hua Jia-dong and Wang Yong-lin were sentenced on the 28th of last month for knowingly selling goods with counterfeit trademarks, each fined twenty yuan. It is reported that the bookstore is currently collecting evidence and will file a claim for damages with the First Court of the Special District. A certain collector, based on his lifelong experience, has collected no less than hundreds of pieces of calligraphy and paintings from various dynasties, all of which are masterpieces by famous artists. In order to solicit opinions from experts from all walks of life, he has decided to hold an exhibition at the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association on Edward Road for four days, starting on April 5th. All sectors are welcome to provide fair evaluations. It is also reported that famous Shanghai artists will be present to appraise the works for identification. A grand occasion is expected.

### Holding a Large Sum of Money, Attempting to Gamble, Ultimately Losing Everything in the Gambling Den, Lying About a Robbery to Avoid Accountability, Exposure of the Crime Leads to Arrest

Ling Jue-qian, a Cantonese man residing at 56 Yue Village, Yidingpan Road, worked as a typist at the Meizuishi Foreign Firm on Jiujiang Road. Previously, at 10:45 AM, Ling was ordered by Dickman, a German employee of the firm, to take a check for 4,900 yuan to the French Bank to cash it and purchase a remittance to the Citibank, in order to remit the money to Hong Kong. Unexpectedly, after Ling

cashed the check

he did not return to the firm until evening, claiming that he had encountered several robbers on Yidingpan Road near Yu Yuan Road, who threatened him with guns, took him to a certain place, robbed him of the money, and imprisoned him for several hours before releasing him. The firm found Ling's statements suspicious and reported the information to the Jing'an Temple police station. Detectives Ni Jia-feng and Xi Tan Kai-nai-tai brought Ling to the police station. Under investigation, it was revealed that Ling's claim of being robbed

was a lie.

It turned out that Ling's family was poor, and his wife was pregnant and about to give birth, with no funds available for childbirth expenses. Having a large sum of money in hand, he went to the Xilai Men gambling house on Jing'an Temple Road, hoping to win a few hundred yuan to cover the expenses. Unfortunately, his luck was bad, and he lost every bet. Within two or three hours, he lost all 4,900 yuan he had received. Unable to make amends, he lied about the robbery. After the police learned the truth, they ordered

Ling's detention.

Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police officer Zhang Tian-yin prosecuted him for embezzlement and making false reports and presented the case, requesting a postponement for further investigation. When questioned, the defendant, Ling Jue-qian, confessed that he had lost all the money at Xilai Men and had none left. He stated that he was willing to find a way to return it. Judge Chuan Lin verified the confession and ordered Ling to be detained for a rescheduled hearing next Friday.

### Old News, Newly Copied: Sixty-Seven Years Ago (444)

(From the "Shen Bao" of the 12th year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty)

On Customs

Shanghai, a corner of the world, gathers the splendor of several southeastern provinces, in contrast to the frugality of several northwestern provinces. Those who have not visited it either admire it or despise it. Those who are usually confident in their strict adherence to principles and have never faltered, suddenly take a trip to Shanghai, and their preferences become even more extreme than those who have lived there for a long time. How powerful is the influence of customs! Recently, the clothing of rural towns has begun to appear in the capital, and the pursuit of fashion is even more prevalent among actors. Today, clothes of honey color and bamboo root green are common, while sky blue and dark blue are neglected. Likewise, shoe stores offer a wide variety of styles, but only those from Tianjin are considered fashionable. The ugliness is not abhorred. Try to count the pedestrians around the foreign concessions, and seven or eight out of ten are wearing embroidered shoes, while only two or three out of ten are wearing cloud-patterned satin shoes, double-strapped shoes, or boots. Even the elderly in their fifties and sixties are keen on following the trend, let alone the young men. As for women's makeup, Suzhou is the most extravagant, but even in its glamour, it emphasizes elegance and simplicity. Brothels abound, competing in skill and beauty, and the wives and daughters of wealthy families often imitate them. It is understandable that people from Suzhou and Songjiang would do so, but even those from Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Shaoxing who have brought their families to live here also compete to emulate them. Hairstyles include pillow styles shaped like plates or turtles, Shaoxing styles shaped like ingots, and Ningbo styles shaped like dragonflies or cicada wings; nothing else is considered fashionable, making it impossible for onlookers to distinguish them from Suzhou natives. Recently, due to the popularity of high buns in brothels, they have also learned to comb their hair in that style. What is the point of such makeup, and why is it becoming so extreme? Is this not the influence of customs? If customs cannot be eliminated, then nature cannot be restored. This is true for everything, from the entire life of a person to a single matter. The number of good people is decreasing day by day, and the number of thieves is increasing day by day, all gradually accumulating from this. Everyone has their own nature, and the world cannot be without customs, but the harm of customs to nature is such that it is worrying for both the superiors and the inferiors.

### Words on Children's Day

— Huang Jia-yin

The Children's Day of April has arrived again. As usual, there will be a Celebration Committee formed, and as usual, there will be a grand celebration. At the same time, as usual, many newspapers and magazines will publish articles criticizing the celebration of Children's Day, and as usual, many people will point out the tragic fate of most children. These are all good.

Indeed, on this, the ninth Children's Day, we should not forget our unfortunate little compatriots, especially those children struggling in the depths of misery and on the brink of starvation. We should not forget them even more.

We acknowledge that, under the current unreasonable social system, it is extremely difficult to seek welfare for the majority of children. We must recognize that only the rationalization of the social system can enable our little compatriots to enjoy genuine welfare. Therefore, on this Children's Day, we must firmly grasp our ultimate goal—to promote the realization of a rational social system.

Today, although the reform of the social system has not been realized, we can still do our best in our respective positions to seek the welfare of children and celebrate our Children's Day.

We must remember: today, planting one more good seed will result in one more beautiful flower blooming tomorrow. Everything is not in vain!

Psychology

### Releasing the Shackles on Children's Psychology

— Cheng Yan-quan

The greatest mental suffering of modern children lies in the oppression they receive from adults, which deprives them of inner freedom. Chinese people have a traditional mindset of forbidding children from playing in general families. Their view is: "Playing will make the children's minds wild." The so-called scholarly families must firmly adhere to the maxim of "Diligence brings success, play is useless," and they want to force children to become mature at a young age and not to engage in various games. However, children are often uncooperative, and regardless of poverty, wealth, or status, nine out of ten like to play games. Thus, adults want to control them, and this attitude needs to be corrected in the 20th century. According to the psychological and physiological development of children, games have great value for children. Physically, games can promote blood circulation, develop muscles, accelerate the movement of internal organs, and improve digestive function. The body's resistance can therefore be greatly increased. Also, because most games are played outdoors and in spacious places, the air breathed can be fresher. Spiritually, games can produce pleasant and satisfying emotions, regulate mental fatigue, and release excess energy. A spirit of creativity and competition can be cultivated in games. Games also have great moral value, such as the habit of obeying rules, a fair and impartial attitude, loyalty to the collective, and the knowledge of collective life, and the virtue of honestly admitting one's failures and striving for improvement, all of which can be developed. Therefore, adults should only guide children's games and not oppress them. They can prevent them from engaging in overly strenuous and dangerous activities, but they cannot fundamentally eliminate them. Because eliminating games is tantamount to eliminating children's development.

Secondly, adults always hold on to their old-fashioned prejudices against children, instructing them on how to behave and not liking children to use trial and error to change their behavior. This is also a kind of oppression for children spiritually, and the so-called creative nature is all suppressed by adults. Thirdly, most parents hold the view that "beating produces filial sons," and they often excessively punish children, making them feel oppressed. This influence causes children to strive for liberation, and sometimes children reject external stimuli psychologically. For example, some children, because their father has a bad temper, learn to resist everything. Others become very shy, dislike being with others, or develop sexual perversions. Children with parents who have bad tempers or are overly strict are often the ones with the worst tempers or the most dangerous behaviors. Fourthly, many families often have a discriminatory view against women, which makes girls' inferiority complex develop even more, making them always hesitant and doubtful when they grow up. If doubt is excessive, they will think that only men are capable.

Fifthly, there is the oppression of children by schools and teachers. Chinese people have always valued the way of the teacher. "If the teacher is not strict, it is the teacher's laziness," which is also the creed of teachers. Teachers always ignore children's psychology and force children to swim in the sea of knowledge, making teaching difficult to be effective. Teachers mostly use punishment, reprimands, and admonishments to deal with problem children. But if they do not understand the child, then no matter how much they punish and admonish, it is useless.

### The Quiet Dahua Road

— Zhou Shi-de

Here, I want to describe the situation on Dahua Road. It is a very short road between Jing'an Temple Road and Avenue Road, east of Gordon Road. However, although the road is very short and ordinary, many extraordinary things have been happening there one after another. Perhaps, some people think this is also very ordinary.

Dahua Road is a desolate road, and it is very quiet even during the day. The road surface is sand, mud, and stones. The sidewalks are also sand and mud, with only the edges of the sidewalks being cement. The two sides of the road are full of warehouses. When trucks come, the sand and dust rise ten feet high. After the trucks leave, there is no sound, and the sand and dust settle, and everything returns to peace. The sandy sidewalks are the mansions of beggars. Beggars are not often in their mansions during the day, because they also have to live, they also have to eat something to maintain their lives. Only when the weather is clear will they sit on the sidewalks to bask in the sun. Some sit there catching lice and chewing them in their mouths, making a particularly loud sound. I think they must be thinking about the taste of the delicacies and fine wines that the rich eat! Some close their eyes and sleep on the sidewalks to rest. The sun shines warmly. But after the night comes, cold and darkness surround them, and they can only huddle under the fences. At this time, they do not have so much leisure to imagine the food, clothing, and sleep of the rich. The only problem is the cold. Their bodies shrink into a ball, and their hearts also shrink into a ball.

When night comes, perhaps not a single figure can be seen on Dahua Road. They may be huddling in the corners of the walls of the big restaurants. However, Dahua Road is always quiet. Except for the sound of the wind, there is no sound at all. Only a street lamp some distance away shows a faint, cold light due to the blowing of the wind.

One night, when I was passing through Dahua Road, I suddenly saw the corpse of a child. On his pale face, nothing could be seen, only the expression of stillness. His small eyes were tightly closed. After that, I did not often walk on Dahua Road. However, I have seen it two or three times since, some wrapped in mats, others lying by the roadside in the clothes they wore when they were alive. Their parents are too poor, and I think this is the reason, which sometimes causes reactions and makes problem children even more problematic. The proper way to correct children is to understand their families, understand their dreams at night, understand their past experiences, and understand their archetypes, and know the bad consequences that occur in all life situations. Putting oneself in the child's past environment and thinking empathetically will create great sympathy for him personally. We have to change the archetype. We cannot simply use life experience to change it, because life experience is already organized according to his own apperception. We can only change him by starting from the root of his personality. For example, many children do poorly in school, and teachers do not like him, so he likes to quarrel, subdue others, and think it is a heroic behavior. But when we analyze it, he is far from a hero. He lacks social interest, leads a useless life, and does not have the courage to compete in his studies. This is a manifestation of cowardice. To change him, we should make him fully understand that his offense is a sign of cowardice.

If school rules are too strict, children's rules should not be formulated according to the principles of criticism, oppression, and punishment. They must be based on the principles of attention to training, education, social value, and development of children's interests. Schools should not allow children to overdo activities, but they should not restrict children's appropriate activities, and they should pay more attention to rewards, punishments, and guidance.

Ellen Key said, "The twentieth century is the century of the child." I hope everyone remembers this sentence.

Essay

### Hell in Paradise

— Tang Ai-zhen

The "isolated island" is a paradise for children and also a hell for children.

As Children's Day approaches, what appears before our eyes is a picture of life with both joy and sorrow, accompanied by a symphony of children's cries and laughter; proceeding on the short journey of human life.

The children in "paradise" are lucky ones, the darlings of heaven. They grow up in wealthy families, and there are no problems with clothing, food, housing, and education... They are carefree and enjoy all the pleasures of the world.

The children in "hell" are unfortunate, the suffering "animals"! They grow up in poor families, with no clothing, no food, and no shelter. Education is out of the question. They wander everywhere, enduring all kinds of misery and suffering in the world.

In the joyful celebration songs of the "angels", we must not forget that on the "isolated island" there are still hundreds of thousands of poor and displaced children, suffering the ravages of storms in "hell"!

This group of pitiful "wailing wild geese" is waiting for us to save them. Happy people, in addition to enjoying their own happiness, must also think about the poor children, do what they can to help refugee children, and donate to charitable organizations, such as orphanages, nurseries, and refugee shelters. More efforts must be made collectively to set up refugee education and training centers in various ways, so that tens of thousands of homeless disaster-stricken children can have a place to settle down and receive education. This is not only the happiness of refugee children, but also the happiness of the entire nation's future.

### Parents and Children

— Xiu He

Children are innocent and easily influenced: "If accustomed to blue, they become blue; if accustomed to yellow, they become yellow." Therefore, all parents should be constantly aware of the environment their children are in. The story of Mencius' mother moving three times holds great wisdom. Because even a moment of carelessness can expose children to negative influences. Here's a real-life example:

A child's parent told me that their child was stealing money at home and spending it recklessly, and the method of stealing was learned from a classmate. I immediately inquired with that classmate, and after gentle guidance, he admitted to telling him the method of stealing money. At this point, I inquired further, asking him how he knew this method. The child, true to his innocent nature, honestly told me, "One day Dad took me to see a movie, and there was a person in it who stole money and lived a very happy life. I thought it was kind of fun, so I told my classmate, and we discussed trying it out at home!"

After hearing this, I gave him a lecture, and he nodded repeatedly with tears streaming down his face. Then, after some more encouragement, he left feeling very touched.

Parents taking their children to see movies is a good thing in itself, but who would have thought that children with poorer judgment could be exposed to bad habits because of it!

A message to parents with children: Please be constantly aware of the environment your children are in, and do not let pure and innocent children fall into the abyss of misfortune without realizing it.

### Who is This Jesus? (II)

Some people's perception of Jesus is the opposite of what was said above; they see Jesus as a great teacher. They don't ask about Jesus' background. They feel that Jesus speaks unlike others, with authority, which is very important. What good is it if a blind man leads a blind man? Jesus is not blind; his teachings are like a doctor's knife, able to pierce the heart, so Nicodemus felt he was a great teacher sent by God. Their great difficulty lies here: they see God through Jesus, but they cannot see that God is in Jesus, so they see Jesus as an ordinary teacher and cannot recognize him as the greatest savior of mankind. Another view, held by some of Jesus' disciples, is that Jesus would become a great leader of the nation. They saw a throne prepared for Jesus in the city of David. However, this view is also wrong. Jesus clearly declared, "My kingdom is not of this world." He was to wear a crown of thorns, but the world could not understand. One day, when Jesus was teaching, he asked his disciples, "What do people think of me? Who do they say I am?" The disciples answered, some said he was Elijah, others said he was Jeremiah, or one of the prophets. On the day Jesus entered Jerusalem, some people still asked, "Who is this?" Others answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." This view is a slight improvement over the previous one. Their answer is correct; Jesus is a prophet. If the Jews of that day could have seen Jesus as a prophet, the Jewish nation today would have a splendid history for people to admire, and Jesus would not have had to weep for the beloved and hoped-for city of Jerusalem. After Jesus asked his disciples what people thought of him, he seriously asked them again, "But who do you say I am?" The outspoken Peter stepped out from the crowd and loudly said, "You are the Christ, the Son of God." From this statement, we seem to see Peter's eyes shining brightly, his hand on his sword, with an air of refusing to change his words even unto death. This view can be said to be at the highest point. Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God. A carpenter? A teacher? Yes. A leader of the divine? A prophet? Also yes. But none of these views can encompass Jesus. Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. This is the correct view. If you want to study in detail, please write to P.O. Box 1227

### Talking About Children's Films on Children's Day

— Xin Ying

In recent years, various countries, in order to implement film education, are producing a large number of films for children. This allows any child to watch films suitable for them and avoids them going to the cinema to watch films that could have a negative impact. Everyone knows that Mouhe's films are not suitable for children, and even if they are, there are only a few exceptions. Therefore, if a country cares about film education and believes that films are not only for entertainment but also a good educational tool, it will specifically create films for children that can develop their intelligence and increase their knowledge.

The League of Nations in Geneva also pays attention to this issue, so it has specially set up a film import museum to promote film education. So far, European and American educational film authors can freely express their own ideas, so the artistic value of their works far exceeds that of professional writers who write scripts specifically for film companies.

The effectiveness of a film does not depend on the quantity; if a good film is produced every two or three years, the effect of this film will certainly be much greater than that of the thousands of films that flood the market. Unfortunately, profit-oriented film companies will never work hard in this area. This depends on the country being able to promote and subsidize it in order to rapidly advance film education.

Regarding this issue, it is not only the government authorities who should be concerned, but also the parents of citizens, who should maintain their right to choose influences for their children. If the films being shown are valuable in terms of education and art, parents may wish to watch and critique them first to see if the film is suitable for children. If it is confirmed that it is beneficial and harmless to children, then take the children to see it, which will have only benefits and no drawbacks. In this regard, the guidance and criticism of film critics should, of course, also fulfill their responsibility!

### The History of Greta Garbo, the Female Lead in "The Greatest Story Ever Told"

— Liang

If you've seen "The Greatest Story Ever Told," you must be amazed by Greta Garbo, the female lead in the film. Because she is not a very well-known star! Yes, she is a newcomer to the screen, born in County Down in Northern Ireland. She showed a talent for acting at a very young age. Later, she participated in a general performance. She knew that she was not interested in anything but the theater. Unfortunately, her parents did not approve of her aspirations and insisted that she go to school. She had no way to resist and had to obey them, temporarily giving up her ideal of pursuing drama and first studying at the University of London and the University of France. Later, she suddenly suffered from a serious case of the flu that almost killed her. The doctors said there was nothing they could do, but she gradually recovered. However, her spirit for studying at school could never be restored. At this point, her mother realized that she was determined to pursue drama and that coercion would not work, so she no longer insisted and let her pursue drama. After performing in "Street Scene," she went to England to perform in "Too True to be Good," but only in a supporting role. Finally, things took a turn for the better. One day, she was sitting in a club when she was suddenly recognized by a producer. Soon, a contract was signed, and she played the lead role in "Golden AT Tow." Although this film was not very good, she was considered by the audience to be a new American actress. Later, when "Old Music" was released, she was recruited by MGM, signed a long-term contract, and was first assigned to co-star with Robert Taylor in "The Greatest Story Ever Told." Now she is waiting for MGM's first assignment of her new work. Audiences who love her, please wait and see. (Remittance to help the needy)

### News of Actors

— Hai

Liang Yiming, a Sheng (male role) actor at the Great Stage, is the chairman of the Tianjin Pear Garden Guild. Last year, he and Zhang Shu, a Kun Dan (female role) actor, and others were hired to come to Shanghai. He represented the Tianjin disaster-stricken actors and requested relief from the Shanghai Actors' Union. They performed a grand charity show and received more than 3,000 yuan in donations, so he has made great contributions to the Pear Garden Guild. Recently, he has received several letters from the guild urging him to return to Tianjin to preside over the guild affairs, and preparations for a welcome are already underway. However, Yiming cannot get away from the Great Stage in the short term.

The Shanghai Star National Opera Troupe is performing in the Philippines. Recently, they have secured the services of Wang Junchen, a veteran of both civil and military roles, in Shanghai. He is scheduled to depart around the 10th. The troupe also needs to hire a stage director. Originally, they had their eye on Lu Wenyi of the Common Stage, but he is the general manager of the Common Stage and cannot leave for the time being. Now, Zhao Ruquan is recommending Meng Junwen, the eldest son of the late actor Xiao Mengqi. He used to sing Lao Sheng (old male roles) but now plays the qin (zither). He has a very rich collection of scripts. The two sides are still in negotiations.

Xiao Sheng (young male role) actor Yu Zhenfei, after announcing his performance at the New Stage, took the early train to Suzhou yesterday morning to sweep the tombs. He will probably stay in Shanghai for a month or so and then return to Beiping. Zhu Chuanming, the pillar of the Xianni Society, intends to go north with him to seek development.

There has been no news recently from Jia Biyun and Jin Lianxi, who formed the Meihua National Opera Troupe to perform in Little Luzon. Their families are very worried. Moreover, his eldest daughter, Ruizhen, is scheduled to get married on the 22nd day of the second lunar month to Yang Suolai, the elder brother of Yang Youying.

### "Huang Tianba" - Different From the Rest

— Xiao Zai

Period dramas are at their peak, and it seems that contemporary dramas have almost disappeared. Recently, a very unique period drama is about to be released, which is "Huang Tianba," written and directed by Xu Xinfu and starring Gu Lanjun. The production company is Danghua Film Company, and "Huang Tianba" is this company's debut. In fact, all the manpower and resources are the same as Xinhua Company, and it is still produced by Zhang Shankun. The most valuable aspect of this film is that its content is very different from that of ordinary period dramas. Other period dramas are usually tragic or romantic, while "Huang Tianba" is full of tension and danger, enough to inspire people and correct the declining trend, and is well worth watching. It is scheduled to be screened at the New Light Theater immediately after "The Emperor and the Assassin."

### "Hero of Troubled Times" - A New Type of Martial Arts Film

— Lin

Recently, "Guohua" produced a new type of martial arts film, "Hero of Troubled Times." The story breaks all the old patterns of gods and monsters, and the structure is extremely bizarre and tortuous. Chen Jingfang of the former Tianyi Company and Xu Tianren of the Central Photography Studio have all achieved new things here, and the new talents from last year's Star Performing Arts Training Institute have also each shown their skills. In addition, well-known stars such as Pi Rang William, Shu Shi, You Guangzhao, Zheng Zhong, Zhou Manhua, Yao Ping, etc. have all participated in the performance.

The story is set in the late Song and early Yuan dynasties. Lady Zhaohua, because her husband, Marquis Jiancheng, was killed and the country was destroyed, went to Guanzhong to secretly plot a restoration, gathering many extraordinary men and women. They robbed Wu Guanghan, who was in exile, causing the failure of the powerful and treacherous officials. Finally, the base, Lu Family Village, was surrounded and turned into scorched earth, so they sought a new location and sought to rise again. Sword curtains and clues are indeed a meaningful historical drama.
