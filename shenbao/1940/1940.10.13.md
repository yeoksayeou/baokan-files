### United States Southeast - Defense Works - Presidential Inspection

Pittsburgh City - President Roosevelt inspected the defense work plan of the southeastern United States here yesterday. At that time, the President inadvertently stated that the American people are now working together to prepare to defend their homes and democracy when necessary. The United States' defense against foreign enemies is inseparable from improving the living conditions of the American people. (United Press Dispatch of the 12th)

### British and American Discussions on Cooperative Forms - Imminent Expansion of Embargo Policy - US President Declares Resolution to Defend Democratic Politics - Approval for the Shipment of Machinery Parts Worth Seven Million Yuan to the Soviet Union

Washington - People here now believe that Japan's attitude seems more moderate, and they hope that this moderation will continue, so that the tension between the United States and Japan can gradually ease. According to popular opinion, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's remarks have obviously softened, probably in view of the very clear determination of the United States, the equally clear strength of Britain, and the form of cooperation that Britain and the United States are currently discussing. However, the section on Japan's intentions, as stated by Matsuoka, cannot deceive people. If the current situation were not so sinister, Matsuoka's words could be regarded as humorous. The German-Italian-Japanese alliance clearly stipulates that Japan must attack the United States when certain changes occur in Europe, but Matsuoka actually said that this is beneficial to the United States, which can be said to be an incomparably slick statement. Some political observers also asked, if Japan is so concerned about the possibility of plunging mankind into war, then why does it allow mankind to suffer such a catastrophe in China? The Japanese newspapers' propaganda of the US State Department as a demon is not enough to deceive people, and the Japanese Times' statement that Japan has adopted various reasonable and moderate steps has not been proven by the fact that Japan has repeatedly decided to infringe on the United States' rights and interests in the Far East. Yesterday morning, a well-known commentator said that the United States is not seeking to start a war on purpose. The cooperation between Britain and the United States has intensified the ban on supplies to Japan, and the implementation of a naval blockade does not necessarily require a naval battle. Japan must know this kind of situation, and this is probably what prompts Tokyo to worry. The position of the US authorities has not changed slightly from before. The deterioration of US-Japan relations has been going on for a long time, and it was caused by Japan's trampling on American rights and interests in the Far East. If you want to eliminate obstacles to improving relations, it lies with Japan. However, Japan's alliance with Germany is intended to deal with the United States, and it will be even more difficult to improve US-Japan relations in this way. In summary, as long as the German-Italian-Japanese alliance exists for one day, the improvement of US-Japan relations will be impossible for one day. News from several sources reporting on the state of the Dutch East Indies' ability to defend itself and its general morale has greatly excited the US authorities. President Roosevelt met with Whitney, the chairman of Pan American Airlines, yesterday and Thursday, who had just returned from a trip to the Far East, and they discussed twice. After leaving the White House, Whitney told people that the situation in Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines all need to be discussed, and attention should be paid to the Dutch East Indies. He spoke in detail about the defense of the area. Since the beginning of this week, the US government has taken various actions to show that it has not abandoned its firm stance to reject Japan's arrogance, such as the recall of US Navy reservists, the strengthening of the garrison in Hawaii, and the advice to American expatriates in the Far East to return home. The Japanese authorities were shocked to see these significant measures coming one after another. This is something strange and is being watched by the US State Department. The gentle tone recently expressed by Suma, the Japanese government spokesperson, is very different from the aggressive remarks made after the signing of the Tripartite Pact. People here are surprised to hear this and give it the greatest reservations. At the same time, cooperation between Britain and the United States to deal with the overall situation in the Far East is still ongoing. The earliest effect of the informal contact between Britain and the United States will be the expansion of the embargo policy. All important military supplies, such as various oils and copper, will be included, and the ban on the export of scrap iron will also apply to used ironware. (Reuters Dispatch of the 12th)

Washington - President Roosevelt today again warned totalitarian countries, saying, "The United States is now busy preparing for war to defend democratic politics. The President gave a national address on Columbus Day, urging the American people to have strong confidence and ensure that the human progress that began with Columbus' discovery of the New World can continue to advance." The President continued, "Illegality and violence are destroying ancient European culture. China will defend it with its own strength." (United Press Dispatch of the 12th)

Washington - According to information obtained here, three military ports and two airfields in Newfoundland will be handed over to the US government. According to well-informed sources, surveying work is currently underway, and air force and naval bases will be built next year. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch of the 12th)

Washington - The US government has approved the shipment of machine parts worth seven million yuan to the Soviet Union. At the same time, it was also heard that the US Navy Commission has approved the leasing of more than 100,000 tons of US oil tankers to the Soviet Union. (Reuters Dispatch of the 12th)

### If the United States Applies Pressure, It Will Investigate and Stop Japanese Threats - General Stanley Delivers a Speech

Philadelphia - Former US Secretary of the Navy General Stanley delivered a speech last night, supporting the proposal to send a team of US destroyers to the Far East to adopt a firm stance against Japan. He said, "Japan will act arbitrarily within the scope that does not directly engage in war with other countries. Once it encounters our opposition, it can stop its actions." General Stanley also urged that war should be declared to the Axis powers immediately, but said that he believed that if the United States could apply considerable pressure to Japan, it might be able to end "Japan's threat." He said, "If you look at the wealth and resources of the United States, what we do is absolutely no problem. Japan will definitely not dare to fight with us." He also declared that from a military point of view, the United States' long-standing doctrine of "not fighting on foreign territory" is extremely "stupid." "What will our fleet be used for? Send them to the upper reaches of the Mississippi River?" The general also said that the only thing currently isolating the United States and Hitler's attack on the Western Hemisphere is the British fleet. (United Press Dispatch of the 12th)

Tokyo - Japanese newspapers today expressed various different reactions to the Far East policy adopted by the United States. Some newspapers condemned the United States for not putting pressure on Japan, but other newspapers predicted that the United States would not continue to support acts that threatened Japan. In general, Japanese newspapers believe that Japan is currently very "calm," which is the opposite of the "panic" attitude adopted by the US government. Local newspapers all believe that the breakdown of Japanese-American relations depends entirely on Washington. The Asahi Shimbun said that if the United States does not take "certain steps" to improve its hardening policy towards Japan, Japanese-American relations will advance to a dangerous point. The newspaper also said, "The United States must now reconsider its Far East policy regarding Japan." The newspaper continued, "The US government has recently taken several measures that are unfavorable to Japan, but we do not believe that Japan and the United States will suddenly meet with weapons." The newspaper believes that although some people in the United States strongly advocate a non-tough policy towards Japan, there is also another faction that advocates caution in dealing with Japan. The newspaper also pointed out that the US military expansion program is still in the "planning stage," so the United States does not seem to be likely to have a military conflict with Japan. (United Press Dispatch of the 12th)

### War Sentiment Between the United States and Japan - Spreads in Washington Officialdom - Senator Wheeler Advocates Economic Sanctions Against Japan

Washington - War sentiment is now spreading in Washington officialdom. Senator Wheeler of the "Liberal Party" of Montana suggested that the United States and Japan should jointly discuss avoiding war under the Kellogg-Briand Pact. He said that it is still possible to end the manipulation of the world by communists. He also reiterated his warning of September 12 that the United States and Japan are on the verge of war. He continued, "If the United States participates in the war, the Soviet Union and the communists will be the only winners." A Washington official with the most informed sources said that he believed that there was a great reason to believe that a war would break out within two months. Another official told reporters that the US-Japan war would break out on October 17, the day Britain reopens the Yunnan-Burma Road. Washington officialdom is divided into several groups on the war issue. One faction believes that war is now inevitable, and the United States should take advantage of the fact that Japan is busy in China and that Britain can provide the United States with full military assistance to immediately declare war on Japan. The second faction believes that war is still possible but not necessary. They pointed out that the war was provoked for the benefit of Britain. The third faction opposes the war and believes that Japan, even if it obtains guarantees of assistance from the Axis powers, will automatically back down before threatening Britain and the United States with war. Senator Wheeler also said, "I believe we are now going to war with Japan. If we fight with Japan, because of Japan's alliance, we will be fighting in both Europe and Asia at the same time. This war will be a long-term war. In addition to the loss of life, the American people will also sacrifice billions of dollars. Regardless of whether the war is won or extended, it will cause inflation, followed by deflation, which will be a worse collapse than in 1929. I do not believe that Japan wants to go to war with the United States. If we stop buying its silk and stop selling it munitions and cotton, the Japanese economy will collapse immediately. So what is the reason for the United States to join the war? When Japan bombed US warships in the Yangtze River and killed American sailors, we did not declare war on Japan. Now, because of the foolish intimidation of this area and Japan, we are going to declare war on Japan?" Senator Wheeler urged Congress and the American people to proceed cautiously and prevent war sentiment. He also said, "If you want to invoke the Kellogg-Briand Pact, now is the time." He concluded, "This move can give both countries time to calm down and avoid a catastrophe." (International News Agency Dispatch of the 12th)

### The United States Will Send Mail Ships - To Evacuate Residents in the Far East - Hull is Negotiating with Companies - Honolulu Red Cross Prepares to Accommodate American Refugees

Washington - Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that he is in daily contact with officials from American shipping companies regarding the evacuation of American expatriates in China, Japan, Hong Kong, "Manchukuo," and Vietnam. Hull said that he must find a way to prepare ships so that American expatriates who accept the State Department's advice to evacuate can be facilitated. (United Press Dispatch of the 12th)

Washington - The government is now planning to send ships such as the American Mail Line's Manhattan and Washington to the Far East to bring American expatriates back to the country. The Manhattan and Washington are two of the company's largest ships, both weighing 24,289 tons and traveling at 20 nautical miles per hour. (Reuters Dispatch of the 12th)

Honolulu - The local Red Cross announced last night that it is now preparing everything to accommodate American refugees from the Far East. According to Battlefield Commander Gasha, American refugees from the East will be accommodated by the local Red Cross Relief Committee. All preparations for this matter were completed months ago. He also said that the purpose of the committee is to accommodate American refugees from the East who are victims of floods or other sudden events. (United Press Dispatch of the 12th)

Editorial

### "Showing Your Hand" and "Gambling with National Fate"

Is today's international situation a contest of strength? Or is it a battle of wits? It is most like a game of poker; the bluffer keeps raising the stakes, trying to scare off the opponent, but who knows that the opponent does not show weakness, and insists on comparing strength: because the stakes are so high, who would blindly give up? In the end, the only thing to do is for each other to show all the cards in their hands, and fight for a win or loss, this is called "showing your hand" (Show-Uown). An American commentator said that the current situation in the Far East has moved towards the path of "showing your hand," which is an appropriate metaphor.

Japan's joining the Tripartite Pact is nothing more than to strengthen its own momentum and scare off Britain and the United States. It fully intends that the US Roosevelt government will not have any major actions before the primary election on November 5 of this year, so the alliance is not enough, and it is followed by direct provocations from Konoe and Matsuoka, thinking that the United States will definitely retreat in the face of difficulties; if the United States retreats, Britain will naturally follow suit; then, relying on this paper alliance, it will coerce the Soviet Union, and then force China to submit in one fell swoop, and then dominate Southeast Asia in one fell swoop, this is just the beginning of a preliminary ambition. Who knows that the evolution of facts and the shift of reactions are completely opposite; the United States is not only not retreating, but advancing; not only is it advancing itself, but also Britain is advancing together: so on one side, Britain announced the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, and strengthened the defenses of Singapore and Australia; on the other side, the United States is preparing to withdraw expatriates from the Far East and actively complete military deployments, "war sentiment suddenly spread in Washington officialdom" (International News Agency Dispatch of the 12th). Although the content of the meeting between Secretary of State Hull and Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi on the 9th of this month has not been leaked, judging from the "pretended calmness" of the Japanese spokesperson and the "repeated explanations" of Yosuke Matsuoka in the past two or three days, at least it can be imagined that Hull's warning was very serious.

Japan's arrogance was so aggressive in the days after the signing of the Tripartite Pact, but the multi-faceted explanations in the past two days were so gentle, arrogant before and respectful afterwards, no wonder world public opinion is saying that Japan has softened. Of course, this softening may be a diplomatic strategy, a military delaying tactic: waiting for the situation to change, or when it is favorable to Japan, to harden again; however, as far as the current situation is concerned, at least it can be said that Japan's false intimidation has hit the top, otherwise, why would it shrink back when it comes to "showing your hand"?

Anyone with a little foresight knows that Japan's collusion with Germany and Italy is more ominous than auspicious; even in Japan, there are many insightful people who are deeply worried about this. To put it bluntly, Germany and Italy's interests are inconsistent with Japan's. Germany and Italy are not afraid of offending the United States at all, and they even wish that Japan and the United States would go to war, so as to reduce the United States' assistance to Britain. Therefore, if the United States and Japan go to war, Germany and Italy will get what they want. As for the aid clauses stipulated in the alliance, in today's situation where the Tripartite Technical Committee has not yet achieved concrete results, that is really only known to God. As for Japan, it is completely different, because before the alliance, Japan considered it best to sit on the fence, on the one hand, it could obtain momentum support from Germany and Italy, and on the other hand, it could extort some practical benefits from Britain and the United States. Now, the situation is completely different, even if it does not have to "pull chestnuts out of the fire" for Germany and Italy, it has to struggle in a siege, and its life and death are unknown. Think about it, Japan has been fighting against China for more than three years, and it is already exhausted. How can it withstand confrontation with Britain and the United States? Even if the Sino-Japanese war is counted as one-on-one, with the United States' existing naval and air force strength, and its potential to build ships and aircraft, compared with Japan, which was originally poor and has been exhausted for three years, it is almost a one-to-five situation. So even if the British Far East forces are left out of the equation—its military facilities in the Far East, such as the Singapore naval base, and its power resources, such as India and Australia, are of course still very important—Japan's confrontation with China and the United States is equivalent to one against six; with such unequal strength, if there are no other reliable helpers, how can it "show its hand"? Some people say that the US naval and air force bases are too far away, which is extremely unfavorable for fighting against Japan, and this certainly has considerable reason; however, there is also one point that must be paid attention to, and that is the realization of the British-American-Australian joint defense. If this is achieved, it will undoubtedly at least remedy most of the geographical deficiencies; moreover, today's United States is no longer the United States of September last year, it has experienced many new tactics in this European war; inevitably, it can also use many new weapons; with the United States' industrial equipment and economic strength, adding thousands of aircraft or hundreds of submarines does not seem to require much time, which is something that Japan can never hope to achieve. Coupled with the power of the economic blockade, this is even more something that the Japanese business community is terrified of. Furthermore, from a purely strategic point of view, the United States is not without a solution; according to a recent British officer, if Japan and the United States go to war, the United States should use Hawaii as a fleet base and the Philippines as an air force base; the general strategy is to use aircraft to bomb Japan. If Japan advances south, it must transfer its fleet from its home country, at which time the US fleet stationed in Hawaii should take advantage of the weakness and enter directly into the Japanese mainland; if the Japanese fleet does not move, then in addition to bombing, the blockade should be tightened, and it may as well sit and wait for Japan to run dry. This view is indeed quite insightful. In any case, if Japan truly softens from now on, it will not fail to be a clever and pragmatic person; otherwise, it will be seen as a bluffer who throws himself into a trap; and finally has to give up after others have caught the chicken. The Japanese authorities themselves said "gambling with the national fate," which is probably the intention of using the remaining strength to make a desperate bet because there is no way to cheat!

### The Yunnan-Burma Road Reopens - Transportation Capacity Will Be Enhanced - Roadbeds, Bridges, and Tunnels Have All Been Improved - Fueling Stations and Repair Shops Will Be Added Along the Road

Chongqing - A spokesperson for the Ministry of Communications said that when the Burma Road reopens on October 18, the total transportation capacity will be increased. In the past three months, China has improved the roadbeds, bridges, and tunnels. If more trucks are obtained, the number of 300 tons of goods transported daily in peacetime can be expected to increase. The authorities expect that there will be no shortage of kerosene supply, because China can import important fuel from overseas through the Yunnan-Burma Road. Fueling stations and repair shops will be added along the road. The Ministry of Communications will set up a general office in Kunming to maintain and improve this road and to direct freight operations. Since the Japanese have occupied French Vietnam, China is now relying on the Burma Road to export tung oil, the collateral for three US loans. According to the Chinese Post Office announcement, except for air mail, ordinary mail from foreign countries will now be transported by the Burma Road to avoid obstruction and inspection by the Japanese. Special oil trucks are now being sent to the Burma Road to carry light mail, while heavier items are carried by other trucks. The Post Office has established several postal stations along the road to facilitate the use of the Burma Road. (Reuters Dispatch of the 12th)

Chongqing - Tseng Yung-fu, China's representative in Yangon, recently returned to China to report on the latest situation in Burma to the government. Now that he has finished his business, he took a plane back to his post in Yangon today. According to what Tseng told a Reuters interviewer, the situation on the Burma Road is very good. Although the past three months have been the rainy season, there was only one interruption for six hours due to a landslide. There are three reasons for this good result: the weather is very good, the roadbed is gradually hardening, and the constant efforts of the Chinese and Burmese authorities to improve the road. (Reuters Dispatch of the 12th)

Lashio - According to sources in Kunming, the Chinese government is said to be considering prohibiting all private and commercial vehicles on the Burma Road for a period of three months starting from October 18 to avoid excessive traffic congestion and hinder military transportation. Only trucks with special permits are allowed to travel on the Chinese territory of the road. (Reuters Dispatch of the 12th)

Chongqing - The Central Daily News published an article today criticizing the British action of reopening the Burma Road, saying that the significance of this move is twofold: (1) It represents Britain's abandonment of its appeasement policy in the Far East; (2) It shows that Britain and the United States have a complete understanding of their parallel actions in the Far East. The newspaper also pointed out the greatness of Britain's ability to correct its mistakes, saying that it is a mistake to interpret Britain's conservatism as a symbol of weakness. Once Britain has decided its will, it will watch it achieve its goal. The newspaper concluded by saying that the clouds that have shrouded the Pacific for the past three years have disappeared due to China's three-year resistance war and the recent actions of Britain and the United States. (Reuters Dispatch of the 12th)

Chongqing - Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tseng Yung-fu, who has been engaged in matters related to trade issues in Yangon for two years, came to Chongqing on official business and will return to Yangon soon. Today, he made a statement saying that the central officials of the Burmese government are sincerely cooperating with China and assisting China in solving the transportation problems of the Burmese Road. Tseng said that China is delighted with Britain's decision to reopen the Burmese Road, and that Britain's action is a subtle shift in its policy. Officials in the transportation industry said that transportation will increase sharply after the road is opened on October 18, because the two sections of the road in China have been greatly improved during the three-month blockade, and guards have been added to the bridges and tunnels.

### German Troops Invade the Balkans - Turkey's Position is Important - Strong Military with Determination to Defend Territory - Axis Powers' Pincer Movement Faces Significant Obstacles

London – A Reuters military correspondent reports that while there is significant troop movement in the Balkans, it is premature to say that the Axis powers have taken concrete action. Germany is currently using intimidation as a prelude. Very little reliable news is coming from the Balkans. The Germans are deliberately stopping normal diplomatic news while spreading rumors of military occupation and impending military developments. These rumors originate from the German side, not neutral sources. They suggest that Germany will attack Egypt and the Suez Canal via the Balkans instead of Libya. However, such an offensive faces significant difficulties. Examining a map, advancing through Turkey to seize Syria and Palestine would be a large-scale operation that cannot be taken lightly. However, we know from our experience with France that Hitler is capable of lightning-fast actions and that his troops are willing to attempt seemingly impossible feats. Boldness is a major factor in warfare, so such unexpected actions cannot be ruled out entirely. General Graziani's Italian troops in Libya have been preparing for some time and outnumber the British forces. Even without a pincer movement from the left, they are in a position to attack. The recently announced black pincer line in Southeast Europe and North Africa is misleading and has no military relevance, as it completely ignores high mountains, steep ridges, and deep rivers. The long-discussed German left-wing pincer movement's route is also problematic. From the Bulgarian border to Aleppo in Syria is 650 miles, and from Aleppo to Haifa in Palestine is over 300 miles, traversing difficult terrain. One might ask why Hitler would advance thousands of miles through such treacherous terrain when Graziani's Italian troops are only 250 miles from Alexandria. Could it be that Hitler believes Turkey can be intimidated as easily as Czechoslovakia, requiring no bloodshed? Otherwise, there is no other explanation. However, Turkey is the largest and strongest country in Southeast Europe, and would not allow enemy troops to approach without resistance. Turkey is the leader of the Balkan Entente, occupies the most strategic terrain, and its straits are the gateway to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, as well as a vital link between Europe and Asia. Turkey has a peacetime army of 26 divisions, which can be doubled at any time. Its army includes some mechanized units, but the terrain is not suitable for them. Therefore, viewed from the perspective of German military strategists who seek to achieve their objectives quickly and efficiently, Germany's theoretical pincer movement is unlikely to be considered feasible.

### German Aircraft Demonstrate Over Romanian Capital - British-Romanian Relations on the Verge of Collapse - British Ambassador Urges Romania to Explain the Truth of the Situation - And Advises Nationals to Evacuate from Danger

Romanian Capital – Last night, as the British Embassy here prepared to leave Romania, the sky over the Romanian capital was filled with a total of 150 German and Romanian bombers and fighter planes. The planes flew very low, appearing to be a deliberate show of force. However, most of the planes flew towards the Ploiesti oil region. Several German air force commanders arrived at the same time, seemingly confirming reports that a squadron of German air force units had been ordered to enter Romania. Some neutral observers believe that the purpose of last night's aerial demonstration was to pressure the British Embassy to withdraw. The embassy is currently awaiting orders from London. Six high-ranking German air force officers arrived here yesterday afternoon, all in uniform. They arrived on a special train and were welcomed by Iron Guard leader and Deputy Prime Minister Horia Sima, other Romanian leaders and cabinet ministers, the German and Italian ambassadors, and the Spanish and Japanese envoys. Romanian officials solemnly declared last night that the entry of German troops and aircraft into Romania was to ensure "the safety of defense, not aggression." Reliable sources reported last night that half of the British Embassy staff may leave here today for Istanbul. (12th United Press Dispatch)

London – British government officials stated last night that after receiving news that a large number of German aircraft had arrived in Romania, Britain's diplomatic relations with Romania were on the verge of collapse. It is said that the government has authorized the British Ambassador to Romania, Sir Reginald Hoare, to decide at any time to sever relations with Romania. It is also learned that Ambassador Hoare has told Romanian Prime Minister Ion Antonescu that Anglo-Romanian relations have reached a most dangerous point as a result of the large number of German army and air force units entering Romania, and Romania's repeated mistreatment of British nationals. (12th United Press Dispatch)

London – It is now officially confirmed here that the British Ambassador to Romania has warned British nationals of the dangers of residing in German-occupied areas.

### Soviet-Finnish Agreement Signed - Demilitarization of the Åland Islands - No Permitting Other Countries to Use the Islands - Aimed at Enhancing Baltic Sea Security

Moscow – On October 11th, the Soviet Union and Finland concluded an agreement in Moscow regarding the Åland Islands. The signatories were the Soviet representative, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vyacheslav Molotov, and the Finnish representative, the Finnish Envoy to the Soviet Union, Juho Kusti Paasikivi. The Soviet Government and the Government of the Republic of Finland, for the sake of enhancing security and peace in the Baltic Sea, deemed it necessary to conclude the following agreement and appointed plenipotentiary ambassadors for this purpose. The Soviet plenipotentiary ambassador was the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vyacheslav Molotov. The plenipotentiary representative of the Government of the Republic of Finland was the Finnish Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Soviet Union Juho Kusti Paasikivi. After exchanging credentials and confirming that the credentials were accurate and valid, they agreed to the following articles: (1) Finland must demilitarize the Åland Islands, not fortify them, and not allow armed forces of other countries to use the islands. In other words, all military, naval, and air force bases, as well as any structures that could be used for military purposes, may not be maintained or built on the islands by Finland or other countries. At the same time, all existing fortifications on the islands must be dismantled. (2) The "Åland Islands Zone" stipulated in this agreement includes all islands, islets, rocks, etc. within the specified area. (3) The Soviet Union may establish a consulate on the islands. In addition to performing its normal consular functions, the consulate may also monitor the implementation of Article 1 of this agreement regarding the demilitarization of the Åland Islands and the prohibition of fortification. If a representative of the Soviet consulate proves that there has been a violation of Article 1 of this agreement, he may request the Åland Islands authorities to request the Finnish authorities to conduct a joint investigation.

Budapest – Hungarian newspapers yesterday carried a dispatch from Bucharest stating that Hungarian-Romanian negotiations on the issue of Romania ceding territory to Hungary have stalled. The dispatches in all newspapers were identical and read as follows: "The committee appointed after the Vienna Arbitration has been conducting negotiations in Budapest for some time. However, a sudden change has occurred in the committee's work. The Romanian government has maintained contact with the German and Italian governments regarding these negotiations. Therefore, we believe that the negotiations between Romania and Hungary have now stalled." (12th Haitong Agency Dispatch)

Budapest – A communiqué here announced that the Hungarian government has called on the Axis powers to intervene in the disputes between Hungary and Romania. Romania's proposal to establish a mixed committee to investigate the treatment of minorities has been rejected, as the experience of the past 22 years has proven that such committees are not only ineffective but also a source of incidents. The Hungarian government hopes to restore normal relations between the two countries as soon as possible. It is generally believed here that the Axis powers' intervention may lead to a further expansion of the measures already taken by Germany in Hungary. (12th Reuters Dispatch)

### British and German Long-Range Artillery - Exchange Fire Across the Strait of Dover - Shell Explosions Shake the Coast - British Navy and Air Force Cooperate to Bomb Cherbourg

London – Last night, under a clear moon, British and German long-range artillery exchanged fire across the Strait of Dover for several hours. During the shelling, British air force bombers attacked German artillery positions. Last night, two German artillery batteries opened fire simultaneously, with the Calais battery assisting the battery near Gris-Nez. A volley of shells was fired every three minutes, landing 80 seconds later. Spectators on the Kent coast saw the flashes of the artillery fire from both sides of the Strait and heard the whistling sound of the shells flying overhead. When the two German batteries fired at each other, the entire coast was shaken by the explosion of shells landing in the sea near the British coast. (12th Reuters Dispatch)

Our navy encountered no resistance on the way to Cherbourg or during the bombardment. On our return, we were subjected to intense retaliatory fire from enemy fortifications, but there were no casualties." (12th United Press Dispatch)

German Aircraft Active Day and Night - London Suffers Another Devastating Bombing

London – Thirty-five districts in the London area and twelve districts in the British coastal area were subjected to heavy bombing by German aircraft until 2:00 AM today (10:00 AM Shanghai Summer Time). Before 12:40 AM, 18 districts in the Metropolitan area had been bombed. In one street, a bomb killed one civilian and caused a gas pipe to rupture and catch fire. Firefighters immediately rushed to extinguish the fire. In another location, a high-explosive bomb destroyed part of a church and damaged a youth association building. Several other buildings were also destroyed. According to the British air defense authorities, the anti-aircraft fire last night was so intense that it forced German aircraft to fly higher than usual, preventing them from coming down. By midnight, eight German aircraft had been shot down, and eight British aircraft had also been lost. However, six airmen escaped by parachute. As German aircraft scattered over London to carry out the air raids, 20 other German bombers flew into Britain from elsewhere and attacked Liverpool twice. In addition to dropping heavy bombs, they also dropped time bombs. During the city's second air raid, a hotel was hit and destroyed, and guests and staff were almost buried alive. Fortunately, rescuers quickly rushed from nearby buildings into the hotel's basement and rescued the guests and staff who had taken refuge there. A town in the northeast was attacked six times last night, but it was reported that the German aircraft were driven away after dropping a large number of bombs, all of which reportedly fell into the sea. Furthermore, according to an official announcement, during the German air raid on Thursday night, a train heading for London ran into a crater previously created by a German bomb, causing two carriages to derail. However, there were no casualties among the passengers. German aircraft continued to drop countless flares over London last night, and the intensity of British anti-aircraft fire was unusually high. Anti-aircraft fire along the Thames River began yesterday afternoon when German aircraft crossed the Kent region to attack. The German aircraft that attacked London initially flew hidden in the clouds, heading directly for London, before being obstructed by British fighter aircraft. After a brief but intense dogfight in the high altitude, the German aircraft turned back towards the coast and fled. (12th United Press Dispatch)

### British Air Force Conducts Night Raids - Heavy Bombing of German Oil Production Areas - Flames Soar Where Bombs Fall - Dutch and French Coasts Also Attacked

London – British Air Force bombers continued to attack key military locations in Germany on Thursday, day and night, focusing on the German oil supply centers according to plan. The targets of the separate attacks by British aircraft included seven oil-producing areas: Hamburg, Hanover, Cologne, Magdeburg, Gelsenkirchen, Ruhland, and Lützkendorf. The large oil refineries in these areas, which have a combined oil production capacity of 1.5 million tons and are vital to the German war machine, are believed to have suffered extensive damage. British aircraft launched the most significant attack on the Rhenania oil refinery near Hamburg, dropping tons of high-explosive bombs and hundreds of incendiary bombs on the refinery and adjacent oil storage buildings over a period of one and a half hours. According to the last British aircrew to leave the area, the Rhenania oil refinery was engulfed in flames and burning, with a total of eight fires. The refinery has an annual production capacity of 400,000 tons of high-grade lubricating oil. According to the Air Ministry's information office, the explosions and fires at other oil refineries after being attacked were similar to those described above. The attacking British aircraft encountered fierce resistance, but braved intense anti-aircraft fire and flew low to ensure accurate bombing. The large oil refinery in Hanover was hit by multiple high-explosive bombs. When British aircraft attacked the Moersburg oil refinery near Ruhland, they first dropped flares to locate it. The refinery has 140 buildings and an annual production capacity of 1.5 million tons of gasoline. Other targets that were heavily bombed included railway hubs in Germany, shipyards and aircraft factories in Amsterdam, and airfields inside Germany and the Netherlands. The ports used by the Germans to prepare for the invasion of Britain were also attacked, with Le Havre, Cherbourg, Calais, and Boulogne being the most heavily bombed. A British bomber, returning from a night raid, flew over the Netherlands and shot down a German aircraft. On Thursday, British coastal aircraft attacked the Dutch coast from Den Helder to Boulogne, Le Havre, and Brest, with coastal areas along the English Channel being targeted. Among them, a German destroyer in the port of Brest was bombed for the second consecutive night. British aircraft braved difficult weather conditions and anti-aircraft fire to drop heavy bombs on the German warship. It was reported that several bombs hit, and the onshore workshops and warehouses were also severely damaged. Three explosions occurred at the shipyard in Den Helder, and the pier was also hit, causing fires in buildings. The British aircrew who attacked Boulogne saw bombs exploding among 30 or 40 small boats, and the British aircrew who attacked Le Havre found the dock obscured by fog, and carried out accurate bombing on a basin.

### Japan Attacking Singapore - Will Face Major Difficulties - United States Closely Monitoring the Situation in Shanghai - Soviet Union Will Maintain Neutrality and Continue to Aid China

Chongqing – Military experts here believe that Japan will face major difficulties in attacking Singapore by land or sea. Therefore, it is unlikely that they will attempt to attack the port. If the Japanese take action, it will likely be initiated in Shanghai first, as it is believed that Britain and the United States will not resist there. It is rumored that Japan covets the East Indies and wants to seize them. If so, Japan must act quickly, or its warships will be subject to a flank attack by the US fleet. Well-informed sources claim that British troops withdrawn from China and a large contingent of Australian troops have arrived in Singapore, significantly strengthening the British garrison there. It is generally believed that Britain's announcement of the reopening of the Burma Road is a form of resistance to Japan. Japan will take no action on this. However, if Japan has no countermeasures, its current cabinet will inevitably fall. It is also possible that Japan, under the secret terms of the German-Italian-Japanese pact, has an obligation to take certain steps. Xinhua Daily states that the Soviet Union will not join any belligerent side but will continue to provide assistance to China. The Soviet Union will adhere to its neutral policy, unaffected by the Tripartite Pact or any external forces. (12th Reuters Dispatch)

### Konoe Admits Encountering Serious Difficulties

Tokyo - Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe declared here today that Japan is currently encountering the greatest turning point in its history, requiring nationwide cooperation to achieve Japan's goal of establishing a "New Order in East Asia." According to his speech at the founding meeting of the National Service Association, Japan is currently in a period as serious and critical as the Meiji Restoration. The National Service Association is an organization selected by the government to promote a new national structure, the purpose of which is to promote friendly relations with neighboring countries and to establish a "New Order" in East Asia. Konoe also stated that the new national structure will enable all people to serve the country, and the old individualism must be eliminated. Indeed, the fate of Japan depends entirely on the realization of the new national structure. Although the new movement has many thorns ahead, no matter what difficulties are encountered, our national policy must clear the waves and not stop until the goal is achieved.

### A Brief History of German Air Force Construction

Of equal significance to the number of aircraft is the way in which the German army uses aircraft. The German army has always used aircraft as a tool for offensive operations, so its construction concentrated its efforts on manufacturing bombers. In terms of effectiveness, this type of aircraft is equivalent to the German army's long-range artillery, carrying shells hundreds of miles away and then firing them into the enemy's ranks. According to German claims, the accuracy of the bombing is unmatched even by the most highly trained artillery. The most accurate bombing is undoubtedly carried out by dive bombers, the inventors of which were originally Americans, and are in fact the most terrible of modern killing weapons.

The function of fighter planes is to protect German territory from external attacks. Recently, German fighter planes have also been covering bombers in attacks on England. Originally, fighter planes were an auxiliary to bombers, with their greatest function being defense. Since the German army captured the Netherlands, Belgium, and France, the airfields occupied by the German army are very close to England, so short-range fighter planes can also cover bombers in attacks on the British Isles.

In addition to fighter planes, the German army has also added a type of "destruction" aircraft, whose function is to be able to attack and defend over long distances. The twin-engine Messerschmitt 110, which can carry two pilots, is the best of these aircraft. This aircraft has twice the firepower of a fighter plane, equipped with four machine guns and two small cannons. It can stay in the air for four hours, while ordinary fighter planes can only fly for an hour and a half.

The best of the German bombers is the Heinkel 111. German aircraft attacking England use this type of aircraft, with a long range of often up to 1,000 miles. Today, whether for long-range or short-range bombing, the German army mainly uses the Heinkel type as its mainstay. The Heinkel fuselage is lighter, enabling rapid flight with heavy loads. According to the 1939 German Aviation Yearbook, the Heinkel's top speed is 315 miles per hour, its range is 1,875 miles, and its payload is 2,000 kilograms. It is equipped with three mobile machine guns and can carry four people. The light bombers are the Dornier 17 and Dornier 215, which are mostly used for reconnaissance. Their speed is similar to that of the Heinkel, but their payload and range are far inferior. The payload is 1,000 kilograms and the range is 1,600 miles.

The Junkers 87 dive bomber is the latest weapon in the German Air Force. Its dive speed is 500 miles per hour and it can carry 250 kg or 500 kg of bombs, which explode within 600 yards of the target, destroying even tanks or trains in motion. The bombs are mounted between the wheels, and the Y-shaped knobs are a characteristic of this aircraft.

Dive bombers fly in a straight line when diving, using the entire fuselage as a guide for the bomb. The pilot's windshield is equipped with a sight for observation. The rear of the fuselage is equipped with a mobile machine gun, and the wings have one or two fixed or mobile machine guns. Five months ago, the Germans claimed that the Messerschmitt 110 was the fastest aircraft in the world. The German army uses this type of aircraft for all its air raids. Its top speed is 450 miles per hour. It is equipped with four machine guns or two machine guns and one small cannon. Last spring, the Germans declared that the maneuverability of the Heinkel 113 fighter plane was better than that of the Messerschmitt, but in reality, the Messerschmitt is still the outstanding weapon in the German Air Force's fighter planes.

These six different types of aircraft are in fact the first-line soldiers of the German Air Force. Most other types of aircraft are used for training. The main air force weapons are only these six types, so in manufacturing, operation, and maintenance, they tend to be standardized, which can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Standardized manufacturing not only allows for the mass production of several of the most effective aircraft, but also provides great convenience in the configuration of parts and in repairs. Today, the ones fighting to the death in the air with British aircraft are also the above-mentioned six types of aircraft, and the highest military authorities commanding their operations are the aforementioned four generals, Goering, Milch, etc. The power of aircraft to surpass the navy has yet to be proven, and even if it is delayed to another day, it may not be easy to find the most reasonable solution. However, since the German army crossed the Strait and launched a large-scale air raid on England, both the Germans and the British know that whoever has air superiority will have maritime superiority.

### American Businessman in Tianjin Urges Restrictions on Japan-U.S. Trade

Tianjin - The American Chamber of Commerce in Tianjin this week suggested that the American government impose the same restrictions on Japanese trade with the United States as Japan imposes on American businesses in China. In a lengthy document submitted to the State Department, the American Chamber of Commerce severely criticized Japan for destroying American commerce by monopolizing various industries and making it difficult for American businesses to apply for customs documents. It specifically requested the government to impose restrictions on Japanese businesses until Japan abandons its monopolistic policy in North China. The document also stated that Japanese troops often set any price to force American businesses to sell goods to Japan. Sometimes the price is so low that it is tantamount to confiscating American businesses' goods. In addition, Japanese officials in North China often conduct unnecessary inspections of American businesses' private property. Furthermore, Japanese merchant ships also particularly discriminate against American businesses' goods. (Associated Press, 12th)

(2) In June, the French government agreed to discuss the issue of some islands in the Mekong River, and Thailand had already guaranteed not to make land demands. (3) In view of recent developments, the French government must guarantee the political status and territorial integrity of Vietnam, reject all demands, and resist any aggression. The conclusion of the document stated that the Thai government is rectifying and measuring this matter. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

### National National Physical Education Conference Holds First Plenary Meeting in the Accompanying Capital, Local Reports on Physical Education Overview Review Proposals

(Chongqing, 11th Dispatch) The National National Physical Education Conference held its first plenary meeting at 8:00 this morning in the accompanying capital, chaired by Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education. In addition to discussing agenda items and reviewing rules, it also passed a list of group review personnel, and then listened to reports from all parties. First, Hao Gengsheng, chairman of the Physical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education, reported on the work of the committee. Hao gave a brief account of the organization of physical education administration, the training of physical education teachers, school physical education, social physical education, health physical education, and the improvement of school military training. He concluded that physical education laws and regulations still need to be enriched and revised, and a large number of cadres and talents need to be cultivated to meet the needs of all parties. School physical education should be gradually improved in accordance with the programs promulgated by the Ministry. Mass physical education cannot be solely borne by physical education venues and must find other ways. Therefore, the use of national and central schools is a problem worthy of consideration. Physical education textbooks must be changed in accordance with current practical needs, and attention should be paid to the applied technology of water, land, and air. It is hoped that experts and physical education teacher training institutions will study this in depth. Representatives from the education departments of Jiangxi, Fujian, Shaanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Guizhou, and Chahar provinces, Yu Yongzuo, Guo Yuntan, Zhuang Wenxiang, Li Jingyao, Shang Cunmei, Chen Guisen, Jiang Rongshu, and Wang Shutang, successively reported on the overview of physical education promotion in various places. Zhang Zhijiang, director of the Central Guoshu Museum, also gave an impromptu report on the work of the museum. Zhang Qianglin, representative of the Aviation Committee, elaborated on (the Air Force and Physical Education), saying that the Air Force is 100% from schools, and is composed of students who love and pay attention to physical education. The representative teams of various sports in Air Force schools are the most heroic, and their casualty rate is as high as 85% or more. From this, it can be seen that the Air Force especially needs physical education, and at the same time, the Air Force especially needs physical education cadres. After the reports from all parties were completed, the meeting adjourned at noon. In the afternoon, at 2:00, the group review of proposals began. The administrative group was convened by Yuan Dunli and Guo Youshou, the teacher group was convened by Xu Benzhen and Jin Zhaojun, the school group was convened by Li Jie and John Ma, the social group was convened by Pan Gongzhan and Wu Yunrui, and the other proposal groups were convened by Zhang Zhijiang and Jin Baoshan. Each group reviewed each course proposal separately until dusk before the meeting adjourned.

Minister He's Speech (Chongqing, 12th Dispatch) The National National Physical Education Conference held its second general meeting on the 12th morning. Minister He Yingqin attended and gave a speech, elaborating on the relationship between national physical education training and military affairs, and the experience of feeling that the national physique was insufficient in the early stage of the war of resistance. He also hoped that all parties would have practical and concrete measures for national physical education in the future to promote the great cause of the war of resistance. Next, representatives from the Military Training Department, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the Political Department reported on the current situation of physical education facilities and the plans for promotion in the future. It was also decided that the directors and inspectors of the education departments of each province and city should report on the implementation of physical education in various places. In the afternoon, each group continued to hold review meetings.

In the first quarter, Huxing was 4 to 7 behind. In the second quarter, Wang Ruyi of Yoyou replaced Zhang Jiapei. Wang Jianchang scored immediately after coming on, scoring four consecutive points.

### Finance Currency Market Mediocre

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation saw HSBC's listed prices unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American currencies was mediocre throughout the half-day, lacking any excitement. This was due to the weekend, with operators showing little interest in buying or selling. As a result, British currency, due to low demand, closed at 3 shillings 8.125 pence. The US dollar weakened slightly to 5.84375 yuan, causing the British-American exchange rate in the local market to reach a small difference of 3.067 yuan.

Sterling Stable, USD Slightly Tight

In the early morning, London large bars were quoted at 0.625 for near-term, with no change for forward dates. New York silver prices remained stable, and London spot gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate between British and American currencies was stable, with a slight increase of 0.125 against Shanghai. The US dollar remained unchanged against the British pound, with a slight decrease of 0.07 against Shanghai. Central Bank listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Banks opened for spot sales in the morning, with British currency at 3 shillings 8.125 pence, and US currency at 5.875 yuan, showing no significant change compared to the previous closing prices. After the opening, foreign sellers showed weak interest, and the market softened slightly. British currency was available for settlement at 3 shillings 7.96875 pence, and US currency at 5.84375 yuan, but transactions were few. HSBC's listed prices were announced unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was announced with an increase of 0.5 pence. Subsequently, Chinese banks suddenly released supply, and the market slightly eased. Approximately US$5.84375 yuan for October delivery was sold to speculators, followed by the American bank Chase and Chinese banks in Shanghai releasing US$5.875 yuan for the current month. At that time, spot British currency was difficult to settle or sell at 3 shillings 8.28125 pence, while US currency was available for settlement at 5.875 yuan. However, the selling pressure soon dissipated, and speculators continued to buy in, leading to a renewed tendency for the market to soften. However, British currency remained stable due to lack of demand. The closing prices were 3 shillings 8.125 pence for British currency and 5.84375 yuan for US currency. The November quotations were 3 shillings 7.96875 pence for British currency and 5.8125 yuan for US currency. Consequently, compared to the previous day, spot British currency was stable, and US currency was 0.03125 yuan tighter. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.

Hong Kong USD Weakens

Hong Kong, 12th (Saturday) Dispatch: The currency market opened this morning with the British pound stable and the US dollar slightly tighter. Spot and forward prices for the British pound were unchanged, and spot prices for the Japanese yen were also unchanged. Spot US dollar weakened by 0.0625 to 23.0625 yuan (yesterday's closing price was 23.125 yuan). Spot Shanghai currency rose by 5 yuan to 393 yuan. The market tightened slightly at 9:15 AM, with spot US dollar continuing to weaken by 0.0625 to 23 yuan. The market was reported tight at 9:25 AM, with spot US dollar weakening further by 0.125 to 22.875 yuan. The market was reported stable at 9:55 AM, with spot US dollar rebounding by 0.0625 to 22.9375 yuan. Spot Shanghai currency decreased by 2 yuan to 391 yuan.

Tianjin Exchange Rate Increases

Tianjin, 12th (Saturday) Dispatch: The currency market opened this morning with a stable report. The exchange rates for telegraphic transfers of British and American currencies each eased by 0.0625. The British currency was 3 shillings 0.625 pence, and the American currency was 5.625 yuan. The telegraphic code for Shanghai currency is unclear. The unofficial market for "Joint Banknotes" continued to rise by 2.25 yuan to 76.5 yuan.

### Gold Market Stable with Firm Undertones

Yesterday's cash gold market was stable amidst opposing buying and selling pressures. The fluctuations were quite narrow during the half-day, as the currency market had entered a state of consolidation, and gold prices followed suit. The morning opening price was a high of 5,590 yuan, as the US dollar was reported tight. However, money changers began selling short, and gold shops also sold, causing the price to fall to a low of 5,550 yuan. Before the close, due to a slight tightening in the currency market, securities firms and banks competed to buy in, resulting in a closing price of 5,580 yuan. Consequently, the price increased by 10 yuan compared to the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday. Most of the over 3,000 taels traded during the half-day were for squaring positions and closing out. Jewelry gold shops and customs gold were reported stable.

Cash Gold Increases by Ten Yuan

The market opened firm in the early morning, with prices 20 yuan higher than the previous day. Gold shops entered with money changers at 20 yuan, to 5,590 yuan. Subsequently, a certain money changer took advantage of the high prices to sell short, and cash gold shops followed suit, causing the market to turn downstream and fall back to 5,560 yuan. Then, with the help of some securities firms buying in, the price rose again to 5,570 yuan. However, a certain gold shop suddenly began selling heavily, causing buyers to stand aside, and the price fell to a low of 5,550 yuan. Fortunately, a certain money changer covered his short positions to make a profit, and securities firms and banks added to their long positions, causing the price to rise sharply to 5,585 yuan. At noon, buyers decreased, and money changers and small longs sold out, causing the price to fall again to 5,575 yuan. However, the closing price was 5,580 yuan, resulting in an increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous day. The underlying trend after the close was initially down and then up. The initial price was as low as 5,570 yuan, but securities firms bought in, raising the price back to 5,585 yuan. Fluctuations of 40 yuan occurred during the half-day. The selling price of cash gold shops was over 10 yuan higher than the cash gold quote, while the buying price was 30 yuan lower. Spot gold was 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and few transactions were made.

Jewelry Gold Remains Unchanged

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael remained unchanged. Datong Bank still quoted 570 yuan, and the new bank quoted the same price, with a reduction of about 30 yuan for buying in.

Foreign Currency Increased Slightly

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw cash gold fluctuate slightly higher. American, Chinese, and British currencies also increased slightly by 0.5 yuan. British gold notes had balanced supply and demand, and the market price remained stable. American gold notes fluctuated within a narrow range, initially rising to 16.82 yuan, then retreating to 16.68 yuan, and finally settling at 16.74 yuan, an increase of 0.04 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong Cai (currency) rose slightly by 0.03 yuan. The selling pressure on Japanese gold notes had subsided, and the market price rebounded, with the evening price at 1.365 yuan. Korean notes had strong demand, and the market price trended upwards, with the evening price rising to 1.15 yuan.

### Grains Wuhu Kexian Rice Arrives in Port Exceeding 10,000 Packages, Foreign Rice Cannot Find Buyers

With the continuous arrival of foreign rice, prices continued to decline. After the market opened in the morning, selling pressure intensified. Actual sales and speculator hoarding remained stagnant, and several new transactions were confirmed. The price of spot foreign rice immediately declined. Although the only source of local rice (transported by bicycle) was suddenly blocked, and water transport was tight, some major players insisted on not selling cheaply, but the prices gradually declined. The afternoon market was 70-80 fen to nearly one yuan lower than the previous afternoon, and 30-50 fen lower than the previous evening. The market fell another 30-50 fen as returned goods could not find buyers. New confirmed transactions included 1,000 tons of Saigon No. 2 from Jianyuan Company at a price of 75.75 yuan, and 500 tons from Shenji Foreign Firm at a price of 75.3 yuan. It was said that the amount was not yet fully met. Yesterday, it was reported that only 75 yuan was agreed for 1,000 tons from China Southern Enterprises Company, resulting in weak market sentiment. There is a high probability that the rice market will continue to decline in the near future.

Yesterday, 50-60 packages of Sutong glutinous rice were offered at 82 yuan. Early indica rice from Pukou was 81-82 yuan, and then 77-78 yuan, showing no significant change compared to the previous market.

Only 400-500 packages of new glutinous rice (Jian, Yaozhan, Baige, etc.) arrived from the lower reaches of the river. The selling prices were stable, with the usual destinations and no price changes. New glutinous rice from Minhang was offered at 78 yuan, Qingjiao Shenzhong at 80 yuan or 79 yuan, Baige from Xitang at 77 yuan, Qingjiao Dujian at 70.05 yuan, and then at 68 yuan. Taicang Yangjian was 67 yuan. Large quantities of Wuhu Kexian rice have been arriving daily, with large ships carrying no less than 10,000 packages. The price was 61-62 yuan. There were no significant changes in glutinous rice from both domestic and foreign sources.

### Foreign Flour Inventory Not High

Flour: Yesterday's supply from Chinese factories remained scarce. Actual sales on the street lacked goods to purchase, causing returned old brand prices to rise to 18.6-18.7 yuan. However, the amount of goods available was small, with only 200-300 packages traded. Speculative buying remained at 18.4-18.5 yuan, but there were no significant transactions due to the weekend. Although the inventory of foreign flour was thin, there were large transactions of foreign flour. There were concerns that the subsequent supply would not be sustained. The issue of the US government suspending export subsidies had a significant impact on the market, so market sentiment was cautious. It was heard that high-brand foreign flour was priced above 19 yuan, and Yangpaotai and Shuangying were priced at 18.8-18.85 yuan. More than 1,000 packages were purchased from the street, and the market prices were quite stable.

Wheat: Yesterday's market remained firm, as the current supply was scarce. Sellers insisted on holding, and factories showed little interest in purchasing. High-grade wheat sent to the concession area was offered at 27 yuan, but no further offers were made. Only 300-500 packages were sent to factories throughout the city, and the prices were still based on the original prices.

### Securities Domestic Prices Balanced, Market Prices Mixed

The unofficial market for securities was stable yesterday. Market prices fluctuated within 0.1-0.2 yuan. Although there were many buyers, sellers were not weak. There were buyers for slightly lower prices, but Dingkang and No. 16 consistently bought in, seemingly brewing changes. Therefore, there was a state of indecision. Dingkang first bought in the morning, followed by No. 16. Then, Hongda and Lianyi sold out, causing the market to ease slightly, but the forces were evenly matched, and there were no significant changes in the morning. In the afternoon, Dingkang and No. 16 continued to absorb, and Lianhe and Lianyi also replenished. Yesterday's market price was high by 0.13 yuan, but it was suppressed by the continuous selling from Tongchang, Lemao, Hongsheng, and Yuanyuan. The results were mixed, with a difference of only 0.1-0.2 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.5 million yuan. A summary table is listed below:

Stock Transactions: 50 shares of Huashang Securities Exchange were traded at a price of 26.25 yuan.

London, 11th (Friday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remained sluggish. Only the stock of the Mercantile Bank of India rose by 2 shillings 6 pence to £7.00, while the rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton Although Sales Season Passed, Cotton Yarn Speculation Still Enthusiastic

The yarn market is still in a state of fluctuation, but most people are bullish. However, the current sales season has gradually passed. However, there is still plenty of speculative capital in Shanghai. Recently, speculation in foreign exchange and gold has been less appealing, and cotton yarn speculation is more interesting. Therefore, there are many people behind the scenes raising and suppressing prices. Market prices rise and fall suddenly, and future volatility is still latent. Today, 3,715 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

The atmosphere in the spot yarn market was enthusiastic in the morning. The shouts were as chaotic as hemp, but new buyers were not active, and most adopted a wait-and-see attitude. 20-count Shuangma (Double Horse) yarn was initially priced at 1,175 yuan. Although many parties shouted high prices, acceptance was not enthusiastic. On the contrary, those who profited sold out, and the market slowly declined to 1,165 yuan. Middlemen and scalpers were more active, and the price rose again. The closing price was 1,173 yuan. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 3,465 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn rose by 5 yuan. The amount of cotton yarn purchased by each gang is listed as follows:

Same Industry 2,720 Hong Kong 745

Total 3,465 Factories Not Interested Cotton Market Stagnant

The situation in the spot cotton market remains firm and quiet. Most people expect prices to rise, but factories are not interested in buying, so the market is increasingly stagnant. However, there are many transactions between colleagues, adding some activity.

Fire Machine Cotton 191.50 Same industry bought 100 bales

WAD 261.00 Guang Sheng bought 400 pieces

Brazilian Cotton 280.00 Same industry bought 12 pieces

Sunderland Cotton 263.00 Chang Feng bought 100 pieces

Oil Market The Second Half of the Month's Oil Deliveries Have Begun

The spot oil market yesterday showed some changes based on the spot market situation. However, the futures crude oil market was estimated based on the spot market, and deliveries for the second half of October have also begun. Moreover, the original source was released, the amount of goods was sufficient, and the prices in the producing areas did not fluctuate significantly, so market sentiment was inevitably cautious. The market atmosphere was quite weak in the early morning, but in the afternoon, speculators took advantage of the situation to stir up the market, and the market rose gradually. As a result, the price turned to an increase of 0.2-0.3 yuan compared to the previous day. It was estimated that 50 pieces of Jiaozhou spot soybean oil were traded at a price of 79 yuan, 5,000 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil at a price of 81 yuan, 10 barrels of Dalian oil at a price of 111 yuan, and 100 loads of Dayou factory soybean oil at a price of 90 yuan. Spot Jiaozhou peanut oil was traded for 200 pieces at a price of 78.25-79 yuan, and 600 pieces for the lower half of October at the same price as spot oil. Also, 200 barrels of Qingdao spot oil were traded at a price of 106.2-109 yuan, 100 barrels for the lower half of October at a price of 108-108.25 yuan, and 150 barrels for the upper half of November at a price of 109.5-109.75 yuan.

### Piece Goods Serge Drill Fine Cloth Increased with Yarn

Domestic Cloth: Yesterday's cloth market was initially stable and then rose. The reason was that actual sales still lacked progress, and market sentiment was that raw material prices were firm and cloth prices were suppressed. Holders of goods adopted a calm attitude, and hoarders still wanted to buy in when the opportunity arose. Yesterday, with the sharp rise in fine yarn, the prices of serge drill and poplin gray cloth all increased by 0.3-0.5 yuan per piece. Coarse cloth, twill, and colored cloth were stable. More than 600 pieces of gray cloth, colored cloth, and coarse cloth were traded on the street. More than 200 pieces of twill and colored cloth were traded by the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs. More than 10,000 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill were traded from various places in northern Jiangsu. More than 100 pieces of velvet, colored cloth, and coarse cloth were traded by the Yan-Jin gangs in the north.

Eastern Cloth: The market was firm and rising, and the trend continued. The price of fine cloth increased by 0.3-0.4 yuan per piece. 12-pound Longtou closed at 36.4 yuan. Serge drill was firm. Buyers were eager for Sijunzi serge, and the price gradually rose to 1.09375 yuan.

Export: Today, 730 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong and 200 pieces were shipped to Yantai.

### Sugar Market White Sugar Weak, Red Sugar Tight

Yesterday's sugar trend was flat, with mixed ups and downs. The current price of Grade 24 coarse white sugar was still 75 yuan at our warehouse for the public association's cut plate, and 74.4 yuan for goods arriving in July at other warehouses, up 0.2 yuan. The current price of transshipment goods remained unchanged at 59 yuan. The ticket number for the 20th of this month was 58.3 yuan, up 0.3 yuan. The price of Dutch red sugar was up 0.4-0.5 yuan, with the current price at 56.3-56.5 yuan, and the ticket number at 56 yuan. The price of Taikoo's Che R Yue B was 73.3 yuan, unchanged. The price of Dongzhan was 72.5 yuan, down 0.2 yuan. The price of DY mark was 70.2 yuan, down 0.2 yuan. The price of HX mark was 70.8 yuan, down 0.2 yuan. The price of HM mark was 66.1 yuan, down 0.4 yuan.

### Coal White Coal Transactions Active

The white coal business has been extremely active in recent days. There is demand from all sides, and purchasing interest has remained strong. Transactions between colleagues have reached 300-500 tons per day. The explicit and implicit prices have both trended tighter. Yesterday, a certain firm traded Hai Yue coal at 216 yuan per ton. Old tickets in the market also required around 205-206 yuan. The price from the warehouse to the cart, plus handling fees.

### Medicinal Materials Armor Scales Rising Sharply

A few boxes of armor scales arrived a few days ago. Since the market inventory was not large, the asking price increased by 5 yuan. However, there was no armor skin arriving, and there was a shortage, so the market was very tight, with prices rising by 20-30 yuan.

Distinguishing the Authenticity of Banknotes (10) Shen Yun

Addendum: Inquiries have been made regarding the 10-yuan and 1-yuan banknotes printed by the Huade Road Company in the 13th year of the Republic of China, which were not previously listed. The responses are as follows:

The design of the 10-yuan note is green on both sides. The central image on the front is the same as the 10-yuan note from the 3rd year of the Republic of China. There are 10-yuan numerals on both sides. The central image on the reverse is a view of the bank's building, with Arabic numerals on both sides. This note has been completely withdrawn and is no longer issued.

The design of the 1-yuan note is light yellow on both sides. The central image on the front is the same as the 1-yuan note from the 3rd year of the Republic of China. There are 1-yuan numerals on both sides. The central image on the reverse is a view of the bank's building, with Arabic numerals on both sides. Due to poor printing quality, there were concerns that it would be easy to forge, so only a small number of notes were issued and then immediately withdrawn and not issued.

Therefore, among the banknotes issued by the bank in the 13th year of the Republic of China, only the 5-yuan note is still found in the market. The other 10-yuan and 1-yuan notes have long since disappeared, so they were not listed.

Correction

In "Miscellaneous Banknotes," "Siming" was mistakenly written as "Six Banks," and "Zhejiang Xingye" was mistakenly written as "China Xingye." We hereby issue a correction.

### (6) Foreign Currency and Suspended Currency

The Central Bank notes printed in 1926 included those with the Hankou place name and the large silver dollar notes for the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. In April 1927, the Wuhan government ordered the concentration of cash in the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications, and the redemption of notes was suspended. In the winter of 1928, the National Government's Ministry of Finance reorganized this by using the long-term financial public bonds of 1928 to exchange Central Bank notes at full face value. The exchange period ended at the end of July 1929, and any remaining notes became invalid. Those found in the market now are these invalid notes. There are also place names of Guangdong and Fujian provinces, which are also invalid notes of the same kind.

China's Hankou-named notes can still be exchanged for gold-backed long-term bonds, but only in units of ten yuan or more.

The bank also has the 1912 version of the Yellow Emperor image exchange notes, which are only valid for Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang place names. The Beijing place name can be remitted to the mainland, and the place names of other provinces have been invalidated and redemption suspended. As a result, many place name notes have been changed, and the reprinted ones are very good, making them difficult to distinguish. Only the bank can identify which numbers are for notes from guaranteed areas by checking the numbers.

In addition, notes with place names of the three northeastern provinces and notes with place names of Chahar and Harbin have also expired and redemption has been suspended.

The bank's Hankou notes have old and new versions. Initially, the old Hankou notes were the same as the Chinese Hankou notes, and redemption was suspended. They could only be exchanged for gold-backed long-term bonds. Later, most of these notes were exchanged back, and the remaining amount was small, so they could be used in the same way as Shanghai notes. It was not until July 1939 that the new version of notes could only be remitted to the mainland according to the North China notes method.

In addition, notes with place names of the three northeastern provinces have also been suspended and invalidated.

The bank's Northern Small place name notes and the bank's old notes before the reorganization have all been suspended and invalidated.

Foreign currency can be remitted to the mainland to the following six provinces: Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Tianjin, and Shandong.

Foreign currency from the eight banks must be transferred through the receiving bank separately.

The 1912 edition of the Yellow Emperor image exchange notes is of great historical significance and created a new era of credit for our country's banknotes. In the early years of the Republic of China, most of the banknotes circulating in Shanghai were issued by foreign merchant banks. Later, the credit of our country's banknotes gradually increased, and the amount issued also gradually increased. In 1916, when Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, he ordered the suspension of redemption, and other banks followed suit. Some branches of the Bank of China in various places suspended redemption, while others took a wait-and-see attitude, which caused a great panic in the financial world. However, the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China deeply understood the importance of Shanghai's financial relations and made every effort to maintain credit, redeeming all deposits and banknotes, and the great turmoil was quelled invisibly. The credit of banknotes in Shanghai was thus firmly established.

The bank also has a 20-yuan note, which has been completely withdrawn due to inconvenience of use, but it is not a suspended note. If found, it can still be used.

### US Navy in China Not Yet Preparing to Withdraw. External Rumors Proved Entirely Unfounded. US Bridge Evacuation Entirely Preventative.

Rumors that the US Marine Corps would withdraw from China, leading to the Marine Corps' various agencies preparing to close down and withdrawing deposits from American banks in Shanghai, are said to be completely inaccurate according to reliable sources. The US Marine Corps here has not received any instructions to prepare for withdrawal, so there will be no action for the time being. According to the above rumors, which arose a few days ago, even claiming that American banks in Shanghai refused to open new accounts for customers and limited withdrawals to no more than 100 yuan each time, an investigation by reporters proved that these claims were entirely unfounded. At the same time, regarding the proposal to evacuate the families of Americans in Shanghai, the US consular authorities here have not yet issued any further instructions. Since news from Washington clarified that the proposal to evacuate civilians was entirely a precautionary measure, the mood of Americans here is not as tense as before, and the atmosphere has greatly eased.

Shanghai Reservists Undergo Physical Examinations

Also, rumors that 60 American naval reservists residing in Shanghai were ordered to report to the Marine Corps headquarters and receive instructions regarding their inaction were, according to reporter investigations, greatly exaggerated. These reservists were only reporting to headquarters for physical examinations. These physical examinations are held annually. During yesterday's examination, two people were found to be unqualified and will not participate in training. Yesterday, it was widely rumored among Americans in Shanghai that American naval reservists would join the naval mobilization order issued by Washington on October 6.

Consulate Notice Issued Yesterday

The English-language "Great America" newspaper reported that Mr. Buick, the acting US Consul General in Shanghai, told reporters that the US Consulate would issue a notice today (the 12th) advising American residents in the city who do not need to remain in Shanghai to leave Shanghai as soon as possible. Mr. Buick declined to disclose the contents of the notice, but said that the notice was largely the same as the Washington telegram reported in the newspapers.

Major Commercial Firms Independently Sending Employees Home

American commercial firms in the city, such as the Shanghai Telephone Company and Mobil Oil Company, have obtained approval from their American headquarters to use company funds to send employees and their families back to the United States. A major American merchant recently told reporters that he believed that the proposed withdrawal of Americans from the city would be fully implemented. It is also heard that several members of the US Embassy staff in Beijing have withdrawn their registrations in Beijing and returned to the United States.

Reserved Ship Berths Only Registrations

Yesterday, the passenger ticket department of the President Lines stated that recent reports that American return trip passenger tickets have all been sold out are actually unrelated to the recent international situation. Since the Sino-US Pacific route, the shipping agency for American merchants in the city, only has the President Lines, although there are other British China Shipping Company and Japanese Nippon Yusen Kaisha several families, but Americans would never take other countries' ships, so the company's passenger tickets had been booked in advance for all ships going to the United States this year before Germany, Italy, and Japan announced their alliance, but most of them are only registrations, and whether to purchase tickets at that time is another question.

### Japanese Warships at Zhenhai Port Bombard Zhenhai, 21 Shells Land in the Urban Area, Destroying More Than 20 Houses, No Casualties

Zhejiang groups in Shanghai received the following telegram from eastern Zhejiang yesterday: (1) Eight Japanese warships anchored outside Zhenhai port. At 5:00 AM on the 11th, one ship departed eastward. At 7:18 AM, three more ships departed eastward. At 8:05 AM, one Japanese warship sailed from the north. At 8:34 AM, two more ships departed eastward and one departed northward. At 10:20 AM, one Japanese warship at Zhenhai port suddenly

Opened Fire on the Suburbs

Thirty-six shells. Two shells landed at No. 35 Xuejia Lane, destroying two houses. One shell landed in the open space near Xuejia Lane. One shell landed at Dajiaochang, destroying one house. Two shells landed at the Chen residence in Tianjiabudu, destroying two houses. Two shells landed at No. 15, destroying three houses. Two shells landed at No. 15 Muxing Lane, destroying one house. One shell landed at No. 24, destroying one house. One shell landed in Dongyi Lane, destroying one house. One shell landed in the open space in front and one shell landed in the open space behind.

Wangjiabudu

Two shells landed, destroying two houses. Three shells landed at No. 14, destroying five houses. One shell landed at No. 13, destroying one house. One shell landed at No. 21, destroying one house. At 11:15 AM, one Japanese warship at Zhenhai departed eastward. There is still one ship anchored. At 1:48 PM, the Japanese warship anchored outside Zhenhai port fired another 38 shells to the north. At 2:35 PM, it fiercely fired 15 shells at Jiangnan, all landing in the sand, causing no damage. (2) Yesterday at 8:15 AM,

Chuanshan Waters

One Japanese warship sailed from the north and blindly fired 14 shells at Chuanshan. At 8:35 AM, the ship sailed east. At 11:50 AM, four Japanese warships sailed from Tingshuimen in the direction of Hengshan and anchored off the coast of Meishan. There was no change. At 2:35 PM, another ship sailed over. There are now a total of five Japanese warships anchored off Hengshan. (3) Three Japanese warships anchored outside Zhenhai port. At 7:45 AM yesterday morning, they fired another 87 shells at Jiangnan without aiming, but all the shells landed in barren land and sand, causing no damage.

### Belgian Ambassador Count de Kerchove de Denterghem Returns to Shanghai from Beijing, Arriving by Ship on the 10th

Belgian Ambassador to China, Count de Kerchove de Denterghem, took his family north to Beijing in early June for a summer retreat, staying for three months. Now that autumn has arrived and embassy affairs urgently need to be handled, he took the Kailuan Company passenger ship south and arrived in Shanghai on the 10th to resume his duties.

Norwegian Chargé d'Affaires Leaves Shanghai for Chongqing

Norwegian Chargé d'Affaires, Mr. Katz-Zeuthen, recently left Shanghai for Hong Kong to visit the central authorities and maintain close contact with the Chinese government. According to his planned itinerary, he will stay in Chengdu for several weeks before taking a plane from Hong Kong back to Shanghai.

### Huang Xuanping Abducted Yesterday

Huang Xuanping, a local, 34 years old, resides at No. 669 Hart Road, Shanghai. Huang usually uses his own car, No. 5469, for transportation. Yesterday around 12:45 PM, Huang, wearing a Western suit, walked out of the company and got into his car at the intersection of Muirhead Road, driving himself home for lunch. At the time, the car was heading west. When he reached the door of his house at the intersection of Bubbling Well Road and Hart Road, three ambushers suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, each holding a handgun, stopping him from making noise and jumping into the car, forcing Huang to drive away. The car and the person were abducted without a trace. Soon, Huang's family learned of the situation and went to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to report and request an investigation. The police station, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to pursue and investigate, but he had disappeared. They notified police stations in various districts and the French Concession to pay attention to the whereabouts of the car. More than an hour later, the car was found on a road in western Shanghai.

### National Day Thrift Savings Achieve Excellent Results, Subscriptions Exceed Projected Amounts, All Sectors Vigorously Practice Thrift and Continue Efforts

In Shanghai, in order to commemorate the Double Tenth National Day, a vigorous thrift and national construction savings movement was launched on that day. In order to express patriotic enthusiasm, develop economic construction, and implement a solid foundation of prosperity, all sectors enthusiastically subscribed to savings amounts, like a rising tide, which was extremely enthusiastic. They have already exceeded the projected target, and the results are extremely satisfactory. All sectors also recognize the great significance of thrift in national construction, so they have abandoned extravagant and indulgent habits and practiced the spirit of enduring hardship to vigorously promote the thrift and savings movement that benefits both individuals and others. Therefore, the amount of subscriptions will increase sharply in the future.

### French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Strike, Labor and Management Still Not Close, French Concession Authorities Are Working Hard to Mediate, Workers Add Conditions Yesterday

The French Concession Water and Electricity Company's labor strike, which suddenly expanded the day before yesterday, still showed no sign of resolution yesterday. The total number of striking workers is more than 1,200. It is reported that they held a meeting again yesterday and decided to (1) add a request for the issuance of uniforms and annual bonus subsidies to field workers, in addition to the 16 demands; (2) insist that the management must recognize the six preconditions before agreeing to resume work as a whole. However, according to reporters, the management has stated that it cannot accept the preconditions and that the company cannot recognize the representatives elected by the "New Trade Union" and hold negotiations with them, which has led to both sides moving to extremes and unable to get close. Traffic is completely disrupted. Some of the arrested workers were released yesterday, including drivers Han Fanggui and seven others, and ticket sellers Gu Dahai and five others.

Police Authorities Engage in Mediation

Yesterday afternoon, four labor representatives went to the political department of the French Police Station to request mediation. The department accepted the request, and the two sides talked for a long time before the labor representatives left. Afterwards, the political department also consulted with the company, and the results of the negotiations were more advanced than in previous days, and it seems that a resolution can be expected soon.

Strict Protection in Front of the Power Plant

The situation in the French Concession was very tense yesterday. Many French Police Station police officers were stationed outside the power plant gate for strict protection. At the same time, most of the White Russian workers stayed in the factory day and night to prevent attacks or abductions by striking workers. The electricity supply in the French Concession is not expected to be interrupted for the time being. Since all the Chinese employees went on strike on Friday morning, 60 temporary White Russian workers have been hired to assist European staff in maintaining operations.

### Hope of Establishing a Special Police Force in Western Shanghai Fades, Municipal Council Detectives Maintain Order

Regarding the issue of the "Special Police" for road construction in the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads Area, Major Bowen, Director of the Municipal Council Police, submitted a proposal and opinion letter to President and General Manager Fei Lida (Fu Xiao'an) and has been waiting for a reply. Because the official document was translated into Chinese, English, and Japanese, the process was slow and has not yet been received. Since Fu was assassinated and died, the negotiations have fallen into a standstill again. Recently, Major Bowen has not held private talks with the other party, so there is no hope of establishing a "special police force" for the time being. At present, the Municipal Council Police Department is still sending detectives to maintain order in the Extra-Settlement Roads Area, and the White Russian team of the Foreign Merchant Corps and the Italian Army's San Marco Battalion stationed in Shanghai are jointly assisting.

Japanese Troops Frequently Patrol Western Shanghai

Recently, Japanese troops have been traveling frequently in western Shanghai and parading in formation. Armed Japanese military police on bicycles are constantly patrolling on Avenue Haig, Avenue du Colonel Henri, and Rue Lokawei all day long. Since the shooting of a Japanese soldier in the Xujiahui area, the Japanese Miura Military Police Department at the Observatory and the Catholic Church has tightened security, and soldiers are also traveling in groups to prevent accidents.

### Standard Time Resumes Today

The Shanghai daylight saving time, after authorities announced it would end, ceased at midnight yesterday. Starting at zero hour this morning, all sectors followed the authorities' regulations and uniformly set their clocks back one hour. All agencies, public organizations, schools, and industrial and commercial sectors have resumed office hours or business hours on standard time from today. For all vehicles entering and leaving the factories and the shift changes of workers, the tramcars of both Concessions' public automobile and trolleybus service also resumed their old schedule. Shanghai's banking industry, money changers, and the two associations issued a public announcement yesterday in order to resume business at the original time, saying, "The authorities of the two concessions in Shanghai have determined that daylight saving time will end at midnight on October 12 (Saturday). The member banks and firms of the two associations will also set their clocks back one hour at the same time, and will return to business hours as they were before June 1. This is hereby announced."

### After the Death of Fu Xiao'an, the Japanese Side Intensifies Security, Military and Police Are Fully Deployed for House-to-House Searches, Ships Along Yangshupu Are Not Allowed to Leave Shore

The case of Chuan Xiao'an being killed in his residence on Shih Kao Ta Road by a male servant at around 4:30 AM the day before yesterday, the murderer being at large, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to sources, after the discovery of Chuan's murder, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces Command, being in close proximity, immediately dispatched a large number of marines and over ten military vehicles after receiving the news, conducting extensive searches and implementing emergency security measures. They also notified the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway lines to suspend operations, and ships along the Yangshupu riverside were also prohibited from leaving port. House-to-house searches were conducted, and even passing cars and pedestrians were not spared. These measures continued until yesterday without any relaxation. Detectives from both concessions have been issued photos of the male servant Zhu Sheng Yuan, suspected of stabbing Chuan, since yesterday morning, hoping for his capture. However, both railway lines have resumed operations since yesterday morning.

Today Encoffining, Burial Next to City Hall

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reported that detectives from the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the "Municipal Police Bureau" all received photos of Zhu Sheng Yuan, the assassin of Fu Xiao'an, this morning (the 12th) in order to be vigilant for his capture at any time. This morning, the Japanese search teams were also active in the western district, stopping vehicles and pedestrians for detailed inspection. Chuan's body will be placed in a coffin at Chuan's residence on Shih Kao Ta Road at 2 PM on the 13th. The coffin will be moved to the city center for mourning. It is rumored that Fu's coffin will be buried near the City Hall building.

Mr. Zhu Yu Kui Denies Marriage Alliance

Lawyer Guo Zuo Tang wrote to this newspaper yesterday, "To the Editor, I am instructed by my client, Mr. Zhu Zi Kui, to state that upon reading the local news section of today's Shen Bao, he was extremely surprised to find a news item stating that Chuan Xiao'an's daughter had married Zhu Zi Kui. Upon investigation, my client's wife is originally from the Pang family and has no marriage relationship with the Chuan family. This kind of reporting is deeply feared to confuse the listeners. Therefore, I respectfully request that you send a letter to the newspaper for correction." Accordingly, I am forwarding this request, hoping that your newspaper will make the correction. Sincerely, Shen Bao Editorial Department, Lawyer Guo Zuo Tang, October 12, Year 29." However, this newspaper yesterday printed the three characters "Zhu Zi Gui."

Another Account of the Assassination

According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry yesterday with relatives and friends close to Fu, Fu was wounded by a knife in a total of six places. It is said that there was one cut each above and below the mouth, one cut on the eye, two cuts on the left and right sides of the neck, and one cut on the top of the head. The wounds on the top of the head and neck were the most serious, i.e., the fatal areas. When Fu was stabbed, Fu's family members heard Fu moaning, but because Fu often talked in his sleep, they did not pay attention. Zhu Sheng, the servant who stabbed Fu, had previously worked at the old house in the French Concession, weeding, planting flowers, sweeping the courtyard, and doing odd jobs. Later, the new house on Shih Kao Ta Road needed an employee to manage the stove and mop the floors, so he was transferred there, for only three months. After he committed the assassination, he took a bicycle and left the house. It was not yet dawn, and the guards, accustomed to him getting up at 2 AM every night to tend to the stove, allowed him to enter and exit the house, so he was able to leave at his leisure.

### Nanchiao Children's Home Chrysanthemum Show Scheduled for Broadcast Promotion

The Shanghai Relief Children's Home, located at No. 99, Lane 258, Wuding Road, No. 99, held its second executive meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM for the painting and chrysanthemum exhibition organized to raise funds for the construction of a workshop and expand the education and care funds. It was decided that fundraising broadcasts will be held for three days from October 21st to 23rd. It was also decided that the conference time would be from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM.

### Personnel Investigating Fenghua Disaster Conditions Departed for Ningbo Today

The drought in Fenghua has recently become increasingly serious, especially in Zhongyi Township. The Fenghua Compatriot Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors on the 5th of this month, unanimously deciding to first send personnel to Fenghua to investigate the actual conditions in the disaster area, and then determine a relief plan. The personnel dispatched were originally scheduled to depart on the 7th, but due to various reasons, they departed yesterday. According to a gentleman participating in the investigation in Fenghua, the trip will take half a month to return to Shanghai. After the investigation, they will return to Shanghai to report and discuss comprehensive relief measures.

### Dinghai Compatriot Association Relief for Hometown Rice Shortage

The Dinghai Shanghai Compatriot Association has previously raised 10,000 yuan, remitted to County Magistrate Su in a certain place in Dinghai, and ordered rice for relief. Now, through overall planning and distribution, all villages and towns have benefited. Currently, the rice prices on various islands such as Zhoushan, Xiushan, Qushan, Liuheng, Xiazhizi, and Jintang average only about 25 or 26 yuan, and with the autumn harvest approaching, it is hoped that prices will gradually fall. However, this year, due to the severe drought and scarce rainfall, the autumn harvest is less than ideal, reaching only 60%, which is truly a drawback.

### Strong Desire for Food Regulation, All Sectors Participate in Rice Purchase, Ningbo Compatriot Association Organizes Collective Rice Purchase, Price Stabilization Committee to Meet Next Monday

Since its establishment, the Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association has been repeatedly commissioned to handle group orders of foreign rice, totaling more than 60,000 bags, greatly benefiting the citizens. Yesterday, a gentleman from the association told a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency that the association's 23rd batch of orders has already been completed and will arrive in Shanghai in mid-November, at which time it can be distributed to the respective purchasers. As for the 24th batch, registration is still in progress, and once a sufficient number is collected, orders will be placed with foreign countries in due course. The gentleman continued, "Group ordering of foreign rice not only obtains cheaper grain, but also increases the reserves of rice warehouses, achieving multiple benefits in one fell swoop. This is truly an urgent matter. All major factories, companies, businesses, and all agencies and organizations are urged to participate enthusiastically in order to order and transport supplies to Shanghai for regulation in batches." (The association's hope that all sectors will participate in collective rice purchase is quite profound. When the reporter first entered the association's office, the gentleman immediately handed over a rice purchase registration form, urging him to fill it out immediately. Only after the reporter explained his intention did the gentleman suddenly realize.)

Ningbo People Purchase Rice

The Ningbo Shanghai Compatriot Association held its 15th joint meeting of directors and supervisors the day before yesterday afternoon. After discussion, it was unanimously agreed that the current rice prices in the city are rising daily, making it difficult for ordinary people to make a living. The Compatriot Association should organize a group rice purchase committee to organize group rice purchases for compatriots. It was resolved that Yan Boying, Zhang Lianfang, Gui Yanfang, Chen Qingzhao, Qin Runqing, Chen Yiting, and Ge Weian should be appointed as members, and Gui Yanfang was appointed as chairman. It was also resolved on the spot: (1) The full price of the rice will be collected as a deposit; (2) Each household's group rice purchase will be in units of five bags; (3) Fuyuan Qianzhuang is designated as the collection agency; (4) This committee will hold a meeting next week; (5) Yan Boying is responsible for drafting the rules and regulations. Zhang Delong, chairman of the Shanghai Cooked Water Industry Association, is also encouraging colleagues to participate in group rice purchases.

Proceeding with Price Stabilization

The Shanghai Price Stabilization Committee has been established since January 5 of this year, and it has been seven months. It has held three rounds of broken rice price stabilization, selling a total of 102,296 bags of rice, with a loss of more than 718,400 yuan. The second round also held three rounds, in addition to the 10,000 bags or so of tribute rice sold in the first two rounds of this session, and the loss reached more than 157,000 yuan. As for the amount of tribute rice sold and the amount of loss in the third round of this session, the statistics have not yet been completed. Now, in order to discuss the procedures for continuing the price stabilization in the next session, the committee has scheduled a standing committee meeting to be held on the 14th of this month (Monday) at the Guangdong Road Shipping Club to discuss specific measures for price stabilization. However, the committee, due to financial constraints, hopes that all sectors will contribute generously.

Foreign Rice Arriving in Large Quantities

Regarding the sources of domestic and foreign rice, they have been continuously arriving in recent days and are being transported to warehouses for assessment. Therefore, warehouse reserves are increasing day by day. According to an estimate by a rice industry committee member, the city's existing rice reserves are sufficient for four and a half months of consumption for both Chinese and foreign residents, and the source of supply is not expected to be interrupted. According to news from the rice industry yesterday, a large batch of foreign rice loaded on a French postal ship is expected to arrive in port on the 10th of this month. Once the foreign rice arrives, the prices of rice in various stores will continue to fall. As for the source of domestic rice, it has also been increasing recently, with the quantity arriving daily from the production areas by land and water routes ultimately being more than 1,000 bags or 2,000 bags. The purchase price of this rice is quite low, and once it arrives in Shanghai, it can generate substantial additional profits, so various merchants are actively purchasing and waiting for the opportunity to transport it to Shanghai for the market.

### Statistics on the Number of Refugees in Both Concessions

Due to the impact of the war, refugees who fled to and were stranded in this city have been returning one after another. According to statistics released by relief organizations, as of the end of last month, less than 30,000 refugees remained in the Public Concession and the French Concession. According to a report released by the Municipal Council's Health Department the day before yesterday (the 11th), after the department's investigation, there are currently only 15,625 refugees in the Public Concession, and there are only 13 reception centers remaining.

### Goods and Passengers Stranded in Vietnam Approved for Return to Hong Kong, Shanghai Representative Has Returned from Vietnam to Hong Kong, First Prepare a List and Then Notify the Vietnamese Governor

Since the Japanese army landed in Vietnam, transportation between Vietnam and Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou has been completely suspended. Shanghai businesses previously transported passengers and goods to Southwest China through Vietnam, which were stranded in Saigon, Tourane, and Haiphong. Businessmen from various industries, seeing the situation in Vietnam becoming increasingly tense, decided through joint meetings to return all passengers and goods stranded in Saigon, etc., to Shanghai via Hong Kong, and Cao Anxuan was dispatched to Vietnam. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce also prepared letters to the Saigon Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Consulate General in Saigon to provide assistance and care. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the transportation industry yesterday that the issue of returning passengers and goods stranded in Saigon, etc., has been approved by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and submitted to the Vietnamese Governor, who specially approved the return to Hong Kong. The owners of the goods prepared a list and notified the Vietnamese Governor. Now, Cao Anxuan, dispatched by Shanghai, has returned from Vietnam to Hong Kong to contact ships to handle the return of passengers and goods stranded in Vietnam. Regarding passengers and goods to be returned to Shanghai, they must wait until they have returned to Hong Kong before being loaded onto ships for return to Shanghai. All return shipping costs must be borne by the owners of the goods.

### Huge Value Copper Ingot Theft Case, Thieves Are Shameless, Originally Involved in Private Arms Sales and Kidnapping, Relying on Japanese Military Talismans, They Made Wild Remarks, Swiss Consul Protests to Japanese Authorities

The "China Press" reported that copper ingots and copper coins worth US$100,000 belonging to the American-owned Mao Sheng Foreign Firm, stored in the warehouse of the American-owned Ruifeng Transfer Company in the Public Concession, were recently stolen by a crowd led by Swiss national White Le. The Swiss Consulate issued an arrest warrant, and police officers from the Municipal Council's Police Department, together with police officers from the Japanese Consulate, went to the Broadway Building with the warrant some days ago to arrest White. However, they were obstructed by Japanese military police. The lawyer for Mao Sheng Foreign Firm will lodge a protest with the American Consulate in this city regarding the actions of the Japanese military police. It is said that White did not openly resist the arrest warrant from the Swiss Consulate, but asked his lawyer to summon armed Japanese military police to the scene to obstruct the arrest. White also telephoned the manager of Mao Sheng Foreign Firm, threatening that if the matter was pursued further, there would be dire consequences. According to reports, White has been in China for a long time. Many years ago, he was involved in privately transporting weapons and ammunition in Sichuan, which resulted in his imprisonment for six months, narrowly escaping execution by shooting. Later, he came to Shanghai and partnered with others to fraudulently sell insurance vests under false pretenses, defrauding funds, and was sued by the authorities. After that, White and a Greek national in Shanghai kidnapped a Chinese general and extorted a large ransom, and were arrested. The Greek national was sentenced to a long prison term by the Special District Court. A reporter from the "Continental Daily News" met White in the Broadway Building yesterday (the 11th). White, relying on the Japanese military as a talisman, made wild remarks, even speaking disrespectfully of the Chinese government, ridiculing the American authorities, and criticizing the actions of the police officers of the Municipal Council's Police Department. He even forgot that he was a Swiss national and declared himself one of the "victors" here, truly a shameless scoundrel among Swiss nationals. White's words were roughly as follows: The copper he stole was "enemy property" and "contraband" confiscated by the Japanese army, not belonging to Mao Sheng Foreign Firm, but belonging to the Chinese government, which entrusted Mao Sheng Foreign Firm to manage it only with a contract to deceive others. Although some of these copper ingots have been shipped out, they have not all been shipped out. The remaining ones will soon be seized by the Japanese army or handed over to the Japanese side by the American authorities. He has documents issued by the Japanese army, specializing in investigating "enemy" property in the Public Concession and can request assistance when necessary to carry out his "task of confiscating enemy property." He also has a document issued by the Japanese military police, allowing him to be exempt from arrest or detention while performing his "task." The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reported that according to sources close to Mao Sheng Foreign Firm, White's words about the owner of the stolen copper were completely fabricated and ridiculous, not worth commenting on. According to sources in charge, there is no doubt about the ownership of the copper stored in the Ruifeng Transfer Company warehouse. The copper was legally transferred to Mao Sheng Foreign Firm by the Chinese Mint in 1937 to pay for the price of the minting machines, and has since been stored in the warehouse. It is said that when the theft was discovered, the copper had not been completely stolen. It is estimated that the stolen copper was worth about US$100,000. The Swiss Consul General in Shanghai, Fang Danier, protested to the Japanese Consul General today, objecting to the Japanese military police preventing the police officers of the Municipal Council's Police Department from arresting White, and requested the cooperation of the Japanese authorities to arrest White.

### Conspiring to Embezzle Huge Sums of French Currency, Falsely Reporting Robbery, Three Offenders Sentenced to One Year Each

Chen Zemin, a native of Zhenjiang, was a partner in the Capital Tongcheng Qianzhuang and was trusted by the manager of the qianzhuang, Jin Zhongheng. For more than a year, he had been responsible for transferring funds between Nanjing and Shanghai without any errors. On September 29, he brought a large sum of 45,000 yuan in French currency to Shanghai and deposited it in the Longchang Qianzhuang on Sichuan Road. His relative and fellow townsman, Lu Zhenquan, learned of this and instigated Chen Zemin to seize the opportunity to embezzle the funds and falsely report a robbery, so that he could live a carefree life overseas. Chen was seduced by him, and after discussing the plan, he bought a pair of glasses in Nanjing and covered the lower end with plaster, revealing only a line of faint light. Then he and Lu went to Shanghai together. First, they took a rickshaw with a black rattan suitcase containing the French currency to the Zhaoshang Hotel at No. 13, Lane 566, Zhejiang Road. Lu handed the suitcase to his fellow townsman, Gao Yuren (Lu's brother-in-law), who worked as a tea boy, explaining the plan. Gao took another yellow leather suitcase and had Chen Zemin open the black rattan suitcase, take out 100 yuan of French currency for miscellaneous expenses, and transfer the rest to the yellow leather suitcase, which was handed over to the hotel accountant, Cheng Yunpeng, for safekeeping. After a while, Chen reported the case to the Sihu Division Police Station, falsely claiming that the large sum of French currency had been surrounded by six robbers armed with pistols near the intersection of North Henan Road and Lao Baizi Road, who silenced him and used a pair of dark glasses to blind him, and that the rattan suitcase had been robbed at that time. The false report was discovered by Chinese Detective Shang Wu and Detective Guo Xiangyao, who arrested the three offenders, Chen, Lu, and Gao, and sent them to the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, filed a lawsuit against them for embezzlement and false reporting of robbery, requesting severe punishment. After being instructed to await sentencing, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the trial yesterday morning and sentenced the three defendants, Chen, Lu, and Gao, to one year of imprisonment each as a warning.

### Romantic Girl Yang Jinfeng Disappeared with Her Mother, The Girl Was Passionate About Movies and Actors, Her Mother Protected Her and They Escaped Together, The Elderly Father Was Left Alone and Utterly Miserable

Yang Haifeng, 46 years old, from Shandong, is a physician specializing in trauma and mental illness. He has been practicing at No. Bei'anli on Dama Road, Xiaguan, Nanjing, for more than 20 years. After the war, he moved to Shanghai and rented a residence at No. 434 Jiujiang Road, across from the Securities Building. He opened the Yang Haifeng Plaster Shop, specializing in the sale of various plasters for bruises and sprains, and all kinds of rheumatic medicinal wines. The business was good, and he had a small amount of savings. His wife, Zang, is from Xuzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, and is 46 years old. She has only one daughter, named Jinfeng, with the nickname Lingdi, also known as Liqiu, who is 18 years old and has some beauty. She speaks both northern and southern dialects. The little girl loves beauty, and after coming to Shanghai, she has been influenced by what she has seen and heard, perming her hair and tattooing her body, resembling a modern woman.

Seeking Advice from Neighbors, Gradually Planting Seeds of Love

Jinfeng once studied in the sixth grade of the Shanghai East Elementary School in the Silk Industry Building on Hankou Road. Her parents only had this one daughter and loved her deeply. A neighbor, Fang, who is in his thirties and from Yangzhou, initially worked as an accountant in a transportation company, earning 20 yuan a month. His wife used to work in a cotton mill in western Shanghai. Fang is a suave and frivolous young man. Due to their neighborly relationship, they were all familiar with each other. Sometimes, when Jinfeng had difficulties in her studies, she would ask Fang for advice. Over time, the seeds of love were gradually planted, and their affection grew. Sometimes they went to the movies together or accompanied each other to amusement parks, walking arm in arm, like lovebirds. However, although people outside had criticized this situation, Haifeng was completely unaware.

Obsessed with Movies, Not Returning Home All Night

Jinfeng is usually obsessed with movies, wanting to find a star title in the industry to show off. She asked someone to introduce her, and last winter she joined the Jin Xing and Yi Hua film companies as an actress. She has been on camera, playing supporting roles as maids in "Three Smiles" films, and her figure can also be seen in "Du Shiniang," which is currently showing at the Shanghai Guang Theater. As a result, she became even more romantic and sometimes did not return home all night. Although Haifeng deeply loved his daughter, he saw this licentious behavior as damaging to the family reputation. He often advised her in gentle words, hoping that she could restrain herself a little. However, his wife, Zang, protected Jinfeng. The elderly couple had conflicting opinions, so there were often quarrels in the family.

Taking All Possessions and Escaping Secretly with Her Mother

On the morning of the 9th of last month, while Yang was ill in bed, the mother and daughter took a suitcase, storing hundreds of yuan of French currency, a current savings book from the Bank of Communications with account number 25318, totaling 350 yuan, and a Shanghai Bank positive deposit book with 300 yuan, as well as Yang Haifeng's personal seal, and many pieces of clothing, fur coats, and silk shirts, and secretly left through the back door, disappearing without a trace. There has been no news of them to date. Yesterday, Yang told a reporter that he had already started investigating the matter and that the truth would soon come to light. He also said that he had intended to find a good son-in-law for Jinfeng, hoping to have someone to rely on in his old age, but who knew that his wishes would not be fulfilled and that he would end up with this licentious and immoral wretch. While speaking, he shed tears and was utterly miserable.

### Landlord of Chengyu Lane on Lafayette Road Cuts Off Water

All the houses in Chengyu Lane on Lafayette Road in the French Concession, totaling more than 100 buildings, were originally the property of Junyi Company. Last year, the company sold more than 30 of the houses to a certain Mr. Xie at No. 768 Kangnaoni Road for a price of more than 170,000 yuan. After the new landlord took over, he forced the tenants to move out on the grounds that the houses needed to be renovated, and then announced rent increases. The tenants, having no choice, reluctantly increased their rent starting in April of this year, by 4 or 5 yuan per building. Less than half a year after the rent increase, the new landlord did not notify the tenants and demanded another rent increase starting in July. The tenants, considering the landlord's demands unreasonable, organized a tenants' union and elected representatives such as Shen Ditao and Wang Yonghua to negotiate reasonably, but without success. Landlord Xie commissioned lawyer Wang Jianfan to file a lawsuit against the tenants in the Second Special District Court. The tenants commissioned lawyer Zhu Yakui to represent them. After Judge Yu Jian opened court several times to hear the case, the debate has already concluded. The plaintiff was recently ruled to have lost the case, and the litigation costs were borne by the plaintiff. Unexpectedly, because the landlord failed in the lawsuit and did not achieve the goal of raising the rent, he suddenly shut off the tap water to the houses starting on the 7th, preventing its use. The tenants are now taking countermeasures and notifying all sectors of society to request fairness and provide assistance, hoping for an early resolution.

### Bomb Explodes in Furnace, Injuring People

The Huabei Foundry at No. 489 Gordon Road and Kangnaotu Road, opened by Ningbo native Chen Chunxiang, was melting scrap copper yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 PM when a bomb was accidentally mixed into the furnace. With a loud bang, Chen's left waist and left arm were injured on the spot, and an apprentice, Qiu Shutao, 19 years old, was also injured in the left arm and collapsed. People summoned an ambulance to send them to Baolong Hospital for treatment.

### Sued for Huge Debt, Wufeng Silk Company Loses Lawsuit

Chen Chenqing, He Shoufan, Li Xizhen and others jointly established the Wufeng Silk Company. In June of this year, due to buying and selling a huge amount of US dollar foreign exchange, they owed the Zhongyong Foreign Firm more than 260,000 yuan in French currency and were unable to repay it. Zhongyong Foreign Firm hired lawyers Xu Shihao and Rong Zhenlong to file a lawsuit with the Shanghai First Special District Court. Judge Mo has concluded several hearings of the case, the details of which have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Mo ascended the bench in the Second Court and read out the main text of the judgment. The defendant, Wufeng Company, should repay the plaintiff 266,782.57 yuan in French currency, and interest at an annual rate of 5% from July 1 of this year to the date of execution. If the assets of Wufeng Company are insufficient to repay the debt, the defendants Chen Chenqing, He Shoufan, and Li Xizhen shall be jointly and severally liable for the repayment. The litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant, Wufeng Company.

### Japanese Ship "Daini Tenri Maru" Returning from Hankou to Shanghai Robbed, Sailed into the Huangpu River at Midnight and Suddenly Encountered a Riding Robbery, One Japanese Person Was Beaten and Injured, One Thrown into the River

The "Daini Tenri Maru" of the Japanese trading company Okudi Trading Company returned to Shanghai from Hankou the day before yesterday (the 10th). At 11:30 PM that evening, when it sailed into the Songkou and reached the river surface of the Huazhong Water and Electricity Branch Power Plant in the Huangpu River, the engine room leader of the ship, Wu Nian'gen, suddenly braked and stopped the ship. At that time, a Japanese employee of the ship, Takao Ichiro, not knowing why, wanted to go and inquire, but when he went outside the engine room, he was suddenly beaten to the ground with iron bars by several other sailors and others on the ship. At the same time, another Japanese employee, Michiwaki Akihiro, was also captured, tied with hemp ropes, and thrown into the Huangpu River. Then, more than 5,000 yuan in cash brought from Hankou on the ship was robbed, and the perpetrators fled without a trace. Later, Takao and others were rescued by others. After the Japanese side received the news, they rushed to send them to the Sasaki Hospital in Hongkou for treatment. Now the Japanese side believes that the case is bizarre and has dispatched detectives everywhere to thoroughly investigate all employees of the ship. I am publishing a lost and found notice in the news column on behalf of all family members to be reunited. I am grateful for this service. To the Editor, Shen Bao Newspaper Office, Shanghai Charitable Organization Joint Disaster Relief Association, Relief Committee for War Zone Refugees, October 12, Year 29.

### The Image to the Right Shows a Photo of Admiral Li Jiesun, Commander-in-Chief of the National Navy, Reviewing Troops in the Pacific Ocean

### New Weapons of the American Navy

Since the last World War, European and American countries have been endlessly inventing new weapons. In the air force, this war has featured dive bombers and "airborne infantry" using parachutes. In the army, there are tanks that can destroy strong defenses like snapping dead branches. The navy seems to have featured fewer new inventions, but Germany and Italy have invented a small, high-speed torpedo boat in addition to pocket battleships, launching torpedoes in the vast ocean amidst turbulent waves. It is said that its destructive power is extremely great, and even large ships cannot escape its impact. The construction and use of this type of small torpedo boat are kept quite secret in Germany and Italy, so few people know its true nature. The United States Navy Department initially doubted the capabilities of these small boats, but during the Abyssinian War, they saw Italy use these small, fast boats to demonstrate against the British Navy in the Mediterranean. More recently, during the Battle of Dunkirk, it was claimed that the German forces used these small torpedo boats and aircraft to sink or damage as many as twenty-one British escort ships. As a result, the United States also rushed to catch up, manufacturing them in large quantities, with a "mosquito boat" fleet expected to be completed by early 1942. (See photo)

The so-called "mosquito boat" fleet refers to the small and exquisite nature of these fast torpedo-launching boats. From stem to stern, they are only about one hundred and ten feet long, equipped with four torpedo launchers and four machine guns. In addition to the captain, they can carry seven or eight sailors. Their speed reaches up to forty nautical miles per hour. When sailing on the water, they can turn left and right, advancing and retreating freely. Therefore, even if aircraft bomb from above, not only is the target smaller, but their agile, snake-like movements and rabbit-like speed make it difficult to hit the boat. These fast boats may appear insignificant compared to giant cruisers, but the four torpedoes they carry are already half the power of ordinary torpedo boats, and their cost is only about one-thirtieth of the cost of a torpedo boat.

These torpedo fast boats will be a new weapon for the American Navy, and their command and driving will be entrusted to new talents in the navy. Because driving these agile and versatile fast boats requires young people with quick thinking and agile hands and feet to be successful. Therefore, the commander of this "mosquito boat" fleet, although a senior torpedo expert, is very young, only around thirty years old, making him arguably the youngest officer in the American Navy. The captains of each boat are even younger, with many having graduated less than six or seven years ago, and the phrase "still have a childlike heart" can be used to describe their demeanor. This is an unconventional "appointment" in the traditional spirit of the American Navy.

The designer and builder of this "mosquito boat" fleet for the United States is not a veteran of the naval community, but a progressive businessman. His name is Henry Sutphen, and he is currently sixty-five years old. He is the Vice President of the Electric Boat Company of Groton. He has a progressive mind and a spirit of courage and perseverance. He rose from a small errand boy to become the manager of the company. With new designs, he created the mass production of yachts. Over the years, even middle-class families have been able to enjoy the pleasures of yachting. The first American ship to use a diesel engine was a product of the company managed by Sutphen.

In early 1915, German submarines roamed the seas, creating unprecedented terror in the Atlantic. The British government representative asked Sutphen for advice on how to resist them. Sutphen replied, "A team of small fast boats would be good." The design of submarine chasers originated from this. Before the war, Sutphen's company built about twelve of these boats each year. However, he told the British government representative, "We can build one every day." British shipyards and naval expert advisors all said this was impossible. But the Navy Department trusted Sutphen's words and asked him to give it a try. Sutphen and his designers worked hard and, in the end, built 550 submarine chasers in 448 working days.

Later, when the United States entered the war, Sutphen also contributed his secret to building submarine chasers to the country. He also used standardized methods to complete the mass production of transport ships. The speed of building steel-hulled ships was like a tailor sewing clothes. The method of shipbuilding was to first manufacture uniform parts, and then assemble them one by one according to the drawings. In an instant, a ship could be assembled successfully, just like a child assembling a toy ship.

When the last European war ended, Sutphen resumed his old business. The submarine chasers he supervised were sold by the government to civilians and converted into fishing boats and ferries. At that time, the US government had not yet thought of forming a "mosquito boat" fleet. It was not until 1938 that the small fast boats of Italy and Germany began to attract the attention of the US naval authorities. However, many conservative naval officers still focused on battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, and scoffed at the power of these small fast boats. But some senior officers did not think so and finally decided to build a "mosquito boat" fleet. President Roosevelt has even requested Congress to pass a construction fund of $1.5 million.

The Navy Department plans to complete this fleet between 1941 and 1942. Trial boats have been built and are being tested in the field. In the future, the strengths and weaknesses of each boat will be gathered, and the final, most perfect one will be used as the standard for mass production. Therefore, although the Navy Department already has this type of fast boat, there is still considerable time before the formation of the fleet. When it is formally used in the future, its production will be like the gathering and disturbance of mosquitoes in late autumn and summer.

The company managed by Sutphen won the bid to build these boats, and his design of a one-hundred-ten-foot fast boat is already being tested. In early 1939, Sutphen saw the war clouds gathering in Europe and could not help but feel uneasy about the completion of the "mosquito boat" fleet in 1942, fearing that it would still be lacking in actual operational capabilities. To respect Sutphen's opinion, the Navy Department sent him to England for observation. He was most impressed by the seventy-foot-long fast boat designed by the famous British speedboat racer Scott-Paine. This boat has a streamlined shape, a flat bottom, and can travel at forty to fifty miles per hour. Even when sailing on rough seas, the shaking is relatively slight. Its ease of use and flexibility are its characteristics. It can carry four torpedoes, several machine guns, and is powered by a powerful Rolls-Royce engine. Because its hull is wide, the space below the deck is more than enough for one officer and seven sailors.

Sutphen immediately purchased one boat for $300,000 and negotiated with Scott-Paine for the right to manufacture them in the United States. After returning to the United States, he invited Navy Department personnel to try it out, and everyone was satisfied. Sutphen guaranteed that he could build twenty-five of these fast boats by the spring of 1941 and use this as the blueprint for mass production in the future. The Navy Department agreed to his proposal and began to implement it. To date, the boats being tested have been successively built. If necessary, the shipbuilding speed can still be increased. According to predictions from within the Navy Department, the United States can complete a fleet of two hundred of these "mosquito boats" within two years.

Naval experts believe that motor torpedo boats have many wonderful uses. The most obvious is like the German use of dive bombers. They can rush to the enemy's position before the attacking forces. If they encounter aircraft carriers, the torpedoes they launch can have the greatest effect. During the day, they attack enemy ships like a flash of sunlight, acting with extraordinary speed and agility. At night, they can also spy on enemy ships, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, making it difficult for people to detect them. They can also attack seaports, drive away submarines, attack enemy ships in narrow waters and shallow harbors, and can also be used for patrol and reconnaissance. These are all the advantages of small motor torpedo boats.

### General Tagore Inspecting French Troops in England

### American Navy Tank

The United States Navy Department has recently ordered a number of amphibious tanks (see image), which can travel freely both in water and on land, climbing slopes and traversing forests. After observing the trial of this vehicle, officials of the United States Navy Department believe that it is quite useful and can be used to transport soldiers and military supplies ashore from warships when landing is difficult. This type of amphibious tank can carry forty soldiers, and its speed is twenty-five miles per hour on land and eight and a half miles per hour on water. The gears on both sides of the vehicle are quite wide, allowing it to travel on mudflats as if on flat ground.

### Turning Point in the Battle of Britain

The outcome of the first year of the European war has created a situation in which a continental landmass is held in check by an island nation. Just a few months ago, the situation was exactly the opposite. At that time, the British Isles were in dire straits, facing the danger of being overwhelmed by the German mechanized power from the mainland at any moment. At that time, Britain, and the entire Western world behind it, whose situation was no less precarious than Britain's, had wide-open doors, unable to stop the rapid onslaught of the National Socialist Party's large-scale forces of fire and steel. From the Pyrenees to the North Cape, the entire Atlantic coast of Europe was menacingly eyed by the giant of German mechanized military equipment, ready to pounce on that "small island nation of Britain" from land, sea, and air.

Today, although there is little change on the surface, the battle situation is completely different. The military situation seems to be largely unchanged. The same rapid forces of the National Socialist Party, in the urgent weeks, used unbelievable blitzkrieg tactics, bombing, burning, killing, and capturing Poland, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France—these same bomber squadrons and millions of assembled motorized troops are still lurking menacingly on the European coast they have captured.

But the situation is no longer the same. Britain has now contained National Socialist Germany and its ally, Fascist Italy, at least as tightly as it is being contained itself. After a year of hard fighting, Britain has now taken the offensive in two of the three aspects of sea, land, and air, namely the sea and air. This is an undeniable fact. As for the land aspect, it will take some time to form an attacking force.

To understand the true picture of the military situation, it is necessary to compare the current situation with the situation at the end of June. At the end of June, France had already collapsed, and the armistice treaty signed with Germany allowed German forces to occupy the northern half of the country and the entire Atlantic coast. French naval bases fell into German hands, and the French fleet was in danger of being seized by the Germans at any moment. At that time, the fate of Britain seemed hopeless. British military experts now admit that if the German forces had launched a full-scale attack at that time, the British resistance would have been questionable. Even Prime Minister Churchill's public speeches revealed his intention to retreat to Canada and continue fighting. The perilous nature of the situation can be imagined.

In that dark week at the end of June, reporters and many neutral observers discussed the overall situation, and all but two expressed pessimism about Britain's future. When I asked them again last week (early September), their answers were completely different. All but one or two expressed optimism about Britain's future, believing that it was impossible for German forces to invade the British Isles, and that any attempt would certainly fail.

What is the reason for this turning point in the battle situation? One is that 200,000 British troops were able to evacuate from Dunkirk back to the country; the second is that the British Navy resolved the issue of the French fleet; and the third is that the British Air Force was able to cope with large-scale German bombing and was able to strike back forcefully. US Secretary of the Navy Knox once said that Britain's chances of victory have increased to 50%, but the British are confident that they will win the final victory.

### How to Deal with Tests

— Wu Yusheng

In the next week or two, various schools will be holding monthly tests. Dear children, how should you prepare before the test? What attitude should you have during the test? And how should you reflect after the test? Everyone should pay attention to these questions!

(1) Preparation before the Test Most children often do not prepare much for tests, simply resorting to last-minute cramming. We should not emulate these self-defeating children. We should first roughly review the content of all subjects, and then carefully study each lesson separately, extracting the key points of each lesson, and thinking of questions to ask ourselves to dispel doubts. If there are any unclear points, ask the teacher immediately, making sure that we can clearly understand all the lessons. It is best not to review the books again a few hours before the test, as this will only disturb our thoughts and tire our minds. We should instead organize our research findings into systematic, orderly, and organized materials. At this time, our minds need to be clear, and our attitude needs to be calm; only then can we cope with ease!

(2) Attitude during the Test There are two things to pay attention to most during the test: one is honesty, and the other is efficiency. Honesty means relying entirely on our own judgment and understanding. If we cannot answer a question, we must not discuss it privately, only seeking the score at the moment and losing the true meaning of the test, so this is something to pay attention to. As for efficiency, it means considering the economy of time, giving full play within the prescribed time, and not getting stuck on one question, focusing only on that question, wasting time, which is very unfortunate. Therefore, if we encounter a difficult question, we may as well put it aside for the time being, first do all the ones we know how to do, and then carefully study that question to find a correct answer, so as not to affect the overall score!

(3) Reflection after the Test After the test, we should make a reflection. How was the result of this test? What are the reasons for the failure? We must carefully reflect on the test process. If we have found any shortcomings, then immediately resolve to work hard to improve next time. Everyone should not think that after the test, we can simply let things go. (Remuneration donated)

### Three Types of Students

— Lu Lishi

I remember a friend telling me a story about three types of students. Whether they are elementary school students, middle school students, or college students, they all fall within these three categories. So what are the names of these three types? Let me tell you slowly:

The first type is the spring type: This type of student is like the Baotu Spring in Jinan, the Huishan Spring in Wuxi, the Hupao Spring in Hangzhou, or, on a smaller scale, a well in a family, absorbing water drop by drop from all parts of the earth, filtered by mud and sand, becoming a spring that never dries up, inexhaustible. This type of student can automatically seek knowledge from all aspects, and can transform one piece of knowledge and understanding from all aspects, through their own selection and research, into their own true knowledge and understanding, so this type of student is the best.

The second type is the parrot type: This type of student is like a parrot. The teacher spends a lot of energy teaching them something, and they also spend a lot of energy learning something; what they know will not be more than what the teacher knows, but will only be less than what the teacher teaches. This type of student can only be considered average.

The third type is the funnel type: The funnel-type student is the worst, it can be said that this type of student is the lowest of the low. No matter how difficult or easy the lessons they learn, no matter how much they learn, they always leak everything out completely, like a funnel. In other words, this type of student learns something and forgets something, learns how much and forgets how much.

Children! Which of the three types of students above do you like to be? I think you will definitely raise your hands in unison and say, "I want to be the spring type!" Well then! Let's all work hard!

### The Consequences of Eating Snacks

— Jin Zhen

Hui is a child who likes to eat snacks. Whenever he comes home from school, he clamors for his mother to buy him something to eat. Seeing that he has worked hard all day in class, his mother will of course not refuse, and will hand him a few fractional bills. A Hui then runs off in a puff of smoke. Because he eats a lot of snacks, especially candy, he often has toothaches. Whenever his teeth hurt, he shakes his head and swears that he will never eat so much candy again. But as soon as the toothache goes away, he is holding candy again.

One evening, A Hui's toothache flared up again. A Ming—his older brother—smiled and said to him: "This is the result of eating too much candy. You see, I usually don't eat many snacks other than three meals a day, so I have never tasted the pain of a toothache. Candy is delicious, but unfortunately, eating too much causes toothache, which is not good. You should know that eating less candy does help our body digest, but eating too much is not only useless, but in addition to toothache, it can cause teeth to change from hard to soft, because eating too much candy makes the blood easily acidic. If the blood is acidic, it must be excreted from the body immediately, so it passes to the intestines. The acid stimulates the intestinal wall, easily causing various acute enteritis. But to make the excretion of acid harmless to the body, it must be neutralized with alkaline substances and transformed into a non-irritating salt. The source of alkaline substances, in addition to the supply in the blood, depends on the teeth, thus causing the teeth to soften. But teeth must be hard, because they are a sharp tool for chewing food. If they become soft, how can that work? If teeth are not healthy, it can lead to indigestion and stomach problems, and even the danger of death."

"Then how can we protect our teeth?"

"Protecting our teeth is very important for our health. If we don't protect them properly, the consequences can be terrible. However, teeth also have many shortcomings: (1) Part of the tooth is made of enamel, so the tooth is very hard, but enamel is easily dissolved when it encounters acid. But in our mouths, there is a special microorganism that can produce acid, so we easily get cavities. (2) Once enamel is consumed, it can never be repaired naturally, unlike other parts of the body that can recover after being injured. Then germs take the opportunity to enter the body through cavities. As the saying goes: "Disaster comes from the mouth, illness enters from the mouth." It's not wrong at all, and some diseases also enter from cavities. (3) Once teeth have grown, they no longer grow, so even if the body develops, the teeth still maintain their original state, so we must pay special attention when changing teeth, otherwise the teeth will not be arranged neatly, which can easily cause disease. As for the protection of teeth, we must also pay attention to three points: (1) We should be very careful in choosing food, that is, eat more vegetables and fruits, and on the one hand, get more sun exposure. (2) We should chew food carefully, which can make the teeth and skull develop, and on the other hand, make food easier to digest. Careful chewing can prevent cavities, because when chewing, the mouth is in motion, so that food does not stay on the tooth surface and in the gaps between teeth. (3) We should brush our teeth before going to bed, and it is best to do so after eating, but at least twice a day, morning and evening. Because the oral cavity is closed during sleep, the air does not circulate, so if the mouth is not clean, germs will easily multiply and cause cavities. So eating more snacks is not good for the body, and it also wastes money, losing in two ways. Why ask for trouble?"

### Potpourri

— Yong

Small ability is unable to shoulder heavy responsibilities, not unable to do things. Being able to hold on to this concept, the children's essence is also exhausted.

A Western philosopher once said: "Childhood represents adulthood, just as morning represents daytime." These two sentences can be used as a motto for children.

### Shirley Temple's Autobiography (18)

— Mine

If I kept all the gifts people gave me, our house would be so full, there wouldn't even be room to live. So, we often take them to hospitals or charities for sick and poor children to play with. But there are some gifts that I absolutely don't want to give away. For example, the five rabbits that Mr. Sheehan gave me for Easter. I was so happy, I specially built a wire mesh enclosure in the garden behind the "Dream House" on the studio lot for them to live in. And the pair of twin  that Jamie Dunn gave me; they still live in that big glass tank, and I cherish them very much and don't want to give them away, especially since my name is painted on their backs. Besides, there is also a fluffy little dog named Lottie, which was a lovely Christmas present. These little creatures are the ones I often play with every day.

Honey, you should know that you yourself are a gift! When you were very, very small, a good friend of Mommy's gave you to me. If I casually gave you away to someone else, how would you feel in your heart? Wouldn't you be very sad? As for your name, "Honey", do you know what it means? It's just because your head is round, like a small cork. The sound of "cork" is "ke ke," so I called you "Honey."

Oh, my dolls are so beautiful, like many noble ladies all dressed up, going to some banquet or dance! Do you know how many I have in total? Twenty-eight in total, and they are all my most cherished ones that I don't want to give away. When we moved to the new house, Mommy specially gave me a room so that these twenty-eight dolls could also have a place to stay. A carpenter was called to build a glass cabinet on one wall of the room, with wooden shelves divided into several layers inside. The dolls are displayed inside, some sitting on the shelves, their long clothes spread out, covering their knees, and some standing, looking very handsome. They seem to be looking at me every day through the glass windows of the small house. I also rarely take them out, unless there is some gathering with friends, then I take them out to join in the fun. If older people come to our house, I have to take them to see my dolls, and if someone wants to see them in more detail, then I have to take them out.

I also have several "Shirley Temple" dolls, their faces and clothes are very similar to mine! I don't know if they are learning from me, or I am learning from them. There is also a rubber baby doll that cries sadly, and a pair of colored dolls that can do tricks on a wooden bar, which is much more fun than my two older brothers playing on the horizontal bar in the garden.

Among the many people I know, the one who gives me the most gifts is Mr. Sheehan. His biggest and best gift is the bungalow in the studio called "Dream House," which really made our whole family very grateful. Now let me tell you the story of this matter. When children are around five years old, they always get sleepy in the afternoon. Even if you are working on a new film, you can't help but close your eyes, so you have to take a nap. Originally, I could lie down on the work table, or lie down next to Mommy, or take a nap on the couch in the dressing room. But the people around me didn't know I was dozing off and kept talking loudly with people: or the carpenters were building scenery and hammering; or the musicians were rehearsing singing for people and suddenly started playing music. This commotion woke me up.

### Visiting Professor Zhao Meibo

— Ye Zhi

Professor Zhao Meibo is an authority in the Chinese music world. Everyone knows that he is a musician with extremely high accomplishments and enjoys a great reputation in Europe and America. After returning to China, he served as the director of the vocal music group at the National Conservatory of Music. He is a lifelong learner and can patiently guide students into the right path of art. For example, the famous film singers Ms. Lang Yuxiu and Ms. Cheng Jingzi, as well as the conductors of various churches such as Ge Chaozhi, Xia Xun'an, and Tian Mingsi, are all students of Professor Zhao.

Recently, I heard that Professor Zhao is preparing to hold a student concert, and I made a visit to get more information. According to him: "In order to enable my students to practice more, know more, and understand more about art, as well as to have more contact with people from the outside world, I have always attached great importance to this matter, and I also hope to gradually take on the responsibility of improving the musical level of the Chinese audience by ourselves. We must work hard, and I hope that all sectors will give us more encouragement and guidance." It is also known that Professor Zhao has specially invited the chief conductor of the Municipal Council Orchestra, Mei Boqi, Dr. Shi Zhaoji, the presidents of St. John's, Soochow and Hangchow Universities, as well as well-known people from society and music experts to be sponsors, in order to support Zheng Jun. The time is 9 pm on the 12th, and the location is the American Women's Club at 522 Jing'an Temple Road. All are vocal music programs, and most of the songs sung are selected from famous operas. People who love music believe that it is worth a listen.

### Li Qinian's contract signed last night

— Hai Xing

Annual salary reportedly over 30,000 yuan

The matter of Yi Hua signing a three-year long-term contract with Li Qinian has been brewing for a long time. Li Qinian has been hesitant because she is unwilling to give up the Hong Kong market. It is now learned that Yi Hua has given Li Qinian a satisfactory reply on this point, and the long-term contract was signed at 8 pm last night. As for the remuneration, both parties are unwilling to disclose it. According to relevant sources, the large annual salary is 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, and the additional remuneration has not yet been included. Such a salary may be an innovation in the country, but Yi Hua believes that Li Qinian's works are particularly appealing in the Nanyang area, so it is willing to sign a contract with a huge salary.

Hawthorne's Detective Cases

### The Destination of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Hawthorne nodded and a smile flickered across his lips. Xu San then escorted the young man out. Hawthorne didn't see him off. After a while, the sound of a car outside the door sounded, clearly indicating that Yu Gantang had been escorted back. I didn't wait for Hawthorne to sit down. I was busy questioning Hawthorne.

I said, "Hawthorne, what about that Lu Jiansheng? I heard from Xu San that he has already left."

Hawthorne slowly sat down and replied, "Yes, I asked Ni Jinshou to let him go, to give him face."

I said in surprise, "Does this person have nothing to do with it?"

"I don't think so—in the situation, he wouldn't have beaten Wang Lilan to death. The tone of his voice when he spoke later also gave me the same impression."

"But the attitude you took towards him in the police station is not consistent with what you are saying now."

The meaningful smile on Hawthorne's lips reappeared. "That was a reaction to his snobbish attitude. I wanted to kill his arrogance. You know that I hate snobbery and class consciousness the most!"

I also said, "But how do you explain his footprints? Aren't his round-toed leather shoes the same size as the footprints on the floor? Although he said that he didn't enter Lilan's house last night, how could his footprints be in the corpse's house?"

Hawthorne's smile suddenly disappeared, replaced by a pensive, frowning expression. He paused for a moment and said slowly: "This question cannot be explained yet, but it doesn't matter to let him go for the time being. He can't run away anyway."

His eyes lingered on the desk for a while, then he turned back to look at me and said, "Bao Lang, you also saw that the old man who looks after the door is also wearing a pair of leather shoes. Although the leather shoes are old and worn, they are also round-toed, and the size doesn't seem to be small. Isn't it?" (134)
