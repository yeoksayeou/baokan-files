### Largest British Arms Factory Manufactures Munitions for Japan; Workers Outraged and Protest to Management

London: The London China Campaign Committee recently passed a resolution expressing its pleasure at the British government's loan to China and requesting that the government make the funds available to China as soon as possible. It also hopes that this will be the beginning of continuous British aid to China until China achieves victory. The committee also hopes that the government can find ways to stop British acts of hostility towards China. For example,央 Company selling gasoline to Japan can be considered a hostile act. According to a report in this city by Reno News, workers at the largest British munitions factory recently discovered that some munitions were stamped with the words "Subject to Examination by the Japanese Army" and realized that they were manufactured to Japanese orders. Therefore, they refused to hand them over and protested to the factory management. They stated that for the sake of serving the country, they are willing to sacrifice holidays or work ten and a half hours a day, but they are determined not to work for the allies of the Axis powers. The factory management replied that their work is for the sake of serving the country because Britain currently needs foreign exchange. Manufacturing munitions for Japan, which has been approved for export by the government, is a way to earn foreign exchange for the country. However, the workers were not convinced by the factory management's explanation. As a result, they unanimously refused to go to work and planned to submit a written protest to the Minister of Labor. This batch of munitions was ordered by Japan from 方 before the outbreak of the European War in 1939. At that time, Britain had not yet implemented an export permit system. (Telegraph, 25th)

Editorial

### Reassessing the Tripartite Pact

At a time when Japan's relationship with the Axis powers is becoming stronger again, and the US proposal to collect tariffs on foreign vessels transferred to Britain has aroused a reaction from the Axis powers, new fluctuations have occurred in Rome and Tokyo regarding the application of Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact. Although the international situation may not necessarily undergo major developments as a result, it is an extremely interesting and noteworthy issue.

Judging from the European war situation, it is undeniable that the Axis camp has exposed a serious decline and is desperately seeking new ways out. However, unless another force can restrain the activities of the United States, the Axis powers absolutely do not want to see the US participate in the war. Therefore, Germany and Italy are threatening the United States with war and involving the application of the Tripartite Pact. Their intention is not aimed at the United States, but to test their ally Japan, to see if it has the intention and preparation to act swiftly. Although Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's two speeches in the past half month, the former intending to state that the clauses of the Tripartite Pact do not have absolutely binding force, and the latter expressing Japan's determination to monopolize the Far East, their main intention has always been to ease the pressure from the United States, declaring that they have no intention of waging war against the United States, without leaving any room for its Axis allies. Given that Japan is simultaneously turning to strengthen its ties with the Axis powers and that Germany and Italy are in an extremely difficult situation, Germany and Italy cannot but demand clarification from Japan regarding the extent to which it is prepared to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the pact.

In the past three months, the international situation has undergone major changes, and therefore, the meaning and value of the Tripartite Pact also need to be reassessed. Originally, this pact was built on two assumptions: first, that the offensives launched by Germany and Italy in the English Channel and the Middle East would quickly lead to the collapse of the British Empire, making Britain unable to take care of the Far East, and the British-owned strongholds in the Far East would also fall into a hopeless state of isolation; second, to take advantage of the time before the US election to threaten the US with the danger of war to force it to abandon aid to Britain and adopt a defensive posture in the Pacific. Therefore, only Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact is the main content, and the United States is its only target. Therefore, although Germany and Japan are watching the war against Greece with their arms folded, that has little impact on the pact. The main thing is to see if it can have the effect of restraining the United States. At the beginning of the alliance, Japan was not unaware that it bore a heavy responsibility alone, but it eagerly hoped that the German and Italian offensives could produce the expected results so that it could take the opportunity to obtain the rewards it expected. However, the above two assumptions completely contradicted the facts and reached an "unpleasant development," and the two allied countries that were combined by this even if they do not resent each other, will inevitably increase their expectations for each other's support and assistance. Japan's recent new measures towards Germany and Italy are certainly arrangements to prepare for future adventures, and may also be the same as the intention of Gaida's article a few days ago, which is to truly clarify the other party's intentions and true situation in order to decide its own future steps.

When the United States adopted a strong attitude towards the Far East this autumn, some people pointed out that it was a gesture to deal with the election, and the Japanese also imagined it this way. But in fact, it proved that it was only the beginning of a new stage in the US authorities' Far East policy. After the election, aid to Britain, aid to China, embargoes, and military expansion have all reached unprecedented levels. Although it is not enough to immediately harvest the effect of resolving the international crisis, the blow to the conspirators who collude with each other to divide the world is extremely significant. The bitter struggle in Britain and the major victories in North Africa and the Balkans are deeply and greatly indebted to the spiritual and material support of the United States. In the South Pacific, those who were preparing to wield the knife and cut off the flesh had to temporarily wait and see for the opportunity, and do their best to please on the surface. In the past month, huge clubs have been wielded frequently. In addition to providing Britain with continuous military, material, and economic assistance in Europe, multiple diplomatic and economic means have also been used to secretly confront Axis activities. In the Far East, Hull has reiterated the declaration of maintaining justice and order in principle, and in action, has loaned huge sums to China, sending naval and air forces east, continuing to impose embargoes, and further making concrete considerations for using the Singapore naval base. The establishment of the new US National Defense Administrative Council and the chairman of the council's remarks that the crisis that led the United States to establish the council is irreconcilable indicate the US's determination to implement national defense procedures and maintain world order, which cannot be shaken by any idle threat or conspiracy.

The decisive battle between the United States and Japan lies in the navy! Judging from the current strength of both sides, although Japan is far weaker than the United States, it occupies a considerable advantage in geographical location. If it fights with its back to the wall, it may not be impossible to fight a battle. Therefore, Japanese extremists have demanded that the sooner the war between Japan and the United States, the better. Because in the process of the arms race between the two countries, time is the most unfavorable factor for Japan, but the Japanese authorities have always hesitated and dared not act rashly. The longer the time passes, the more Japan's disadvantage will be, and the less assistance it can provide to Germany and Italy. Of course, the world should not underestimate the future crisis because of this. Before the final outcome of the European situation has been determined, the situation in the South Pacific may still erupt at any time. The preparations of the great powers in the Far East have not yet fully grasped the ability to respond to changes, so there is still a need to continue to strengthen their strength. However, Japan can only consider this future purely from its own interests. Unless the environment and time are absolutely favorable to Japan, it will never make choices because of the constraints of the alliance. The Japanese government spokesperson's statement on the morning of the 24th has clearly stated that they do not resonate with Gaida's arguments. Therefore, in terms of the restraining effect of the Tripartite Pact on the United States alone, in any case, it is an irreversible failure.

In other words, he declared that if Germany continues to make excessive demands, he will resign. The city has received news from Germany stating that German military circles oppose political interference in French affairs, as political interference may necessitate the occupation of the entire French territory.

At the same time, it is reported that Germany is still putting pressure on the Vichy government to reinstate former Foreign Minister Laval. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

Vichy: It is reported that French Naval Minister Admiral Darlan is currently in Paris holding important meetings with German officials. (Associated Press dispatch, 25th)

This time, he has spared no effort in criticizing Pétain's convocation of a "consultative meeting," calling it a "rebellion of senior officials." At the beginning of the European war, Fifth, along with Laval and Foreign Minister Bonnet, united to oppose resistance to Germany and vigorously advocated in their newspapers, "Why should we seek our own destruction for the sake of Danzig?" Fifth insisted that the French people, and even the British, should not fight for Danzig. Before Laval's downfall, Fifth fiercely attacked the entire Vichy cabinet, only supporting Laval alone. After he published his essay "Rebellion of Senior Officials," General Laurentie, Vichy's representative in Paris, requested the police to arrest him, but Fifth was released after being detained for only two hours, and General Laurentie was subsequently dismissed from his post.

Special Feature

### American Ambassador to Japan, Grew

American Ambassador to Japan, Grew, delivered two sharply worded speeches in Tokyo, which shook the international community. The following is a translation of an article about Ambassador Grew from the American magazine "Life":

American Ambassador to Japan, Grew, returned home for vacation last autumn. When he returned to his post, he arrived in Yokohama. As he was disembarking from the ship, a group of journalists surrounded him, each asking him poetic questions. After the usual bows, greetings, and apologies, one person asked, "Does Your Excellency hide a sword in your heart, or a dove?" (The dove is a symbol of peace.)

Ambassador Grew's reply was in no way poetic. He said simply and directly, "I have no hidden agenda in my heart, I only hope to wholeheartedly, single-mindedly, and with all my strength, maintain the friendship between Japan and the United States."

The friendship between Japan and the United States has, of course, become the most critical issue in American foreign policy. Ambassador Grew has always been a leading figure advocating friendly relations with Japan, and he bears an extraordinary responsibility in the diplomatic arena. Before Grew, the American Ambassadors to Japan died frequently, with five changes in ten years and two changes in two years, making it a very unstable position. When Grew went to Japan to take up his post in 1932, the Manchurian Incident had already spread to Shanghai (i.e., the January 28th Incident), and the situation was serious. Even the usually optimistic Ambassador Grew had to be cautious. He wanted to find an opportunity to do his good work. He said, "If the ambassador's duties are only to convey orders, the length of his term is of course irrelevant. If he wants to explain the thoughts, character, and feelings of the people of the host country to his own country, time is very important. It takes years to get to the bottom of things, so I very much hope to be in office for a long time." Ambassador Grew is still in office to this day, and no one else is better suited for this important task. Moreover, Grew's personality, conduct, appearance, attitude, love of sports, passion for music, humility, elegance, and romantic freedom all align with the Japanese people's preferences.

The Japanese nation is not only like a group of melancholic poets, but also suffers from suppressed physical development. Their national psychology stems from this point. In any case, the Japanese revere tall and extraordinary people. Grew is tall and slender, over six feet tall, which gives him a great advantage. The Japanese also admire champions because of their physical condition. They tell every child, "You will one day become a swimming champion in the world sports competition." Grew himself is an athlete and treats diplomacy like sports. He compared a diplomat to a goalkeeper in a soccer game, who must be alert and agile, ready to deal with balls coming from any direction to avoid damaging national prestige. Grew mixes career and sports into one. He has shot pheasants with the German Emperor and hunted ducks with the Japanese Imperial Family. He has also participated in skating competitions in Switzerland and swam across the Bosphorus Strait. Grew's diplomatic victories in Japan are mostly due to this.

The Japanese love music. On the streets of Tokyo, vendors sing and sell along the way. Japanese jazz music integrates East and West, and the stores are filled with it. The concerts at the American Embassy are famous in Tokyo, and Ambassador Grew often listens to phonograph records all night long. Whenever he travels, he always carries his collection of various photo albums and the latest portable phonograph. He and his wife have also subsidized countless Japanese musicians. He composed a waltz for public performance during the Paris Peace Conference. Whenever this young and unrestrained diplomat entered the Ritz dance hall, the band would always play Grew's famous dance tune.

His only goal in using diplomatic skills with Japan is to maintain Japanese friendship. He deeply understands the Japanese psychology and knows that there are two best ways to approach the Japanese: one is sharp but not angry criticism, and the other is a kind and sincere humble attitude. Therefore, Ambassador Grew is always praised as a sincere person whenever he protests against Japan's disregard for American interests. Last autumn, he delivered a speech in a very sharp tone, expressing American opinions on Japan. He said, "The United States knows all the facts, but none of them are welcome to her." His value has therefore increased a lot. Mr. Piatt, the special correspondent of the New York Times and the leader of the Tokyo correspondents for various newspapers, said that Grew's speech was like a slow-motion thunderbolt.

The more Ambassador Grew criticizes the Japanese, the more the Japanese welcome him. Several times, his stern rebuttals have been met with excessive "Oriental love." In 1937, he protested to Japan because the American gunboat Panay was bombed in the Yangtze River. Afterwards, 70 million Japanese believed that they should personally apologize to Ambassador Grew. Letters and telegrams flew in, and gifts were sent one after another. One newspaper collected 1,000 yuan and sent it to Ambassador Grew. A Japanese girl even went to the American Embassy, took out scissors from her sleeves, cut off a lock of her beautiful hair, carefully tied it up, inserted a carnation, and personally sent it to Ambassador Grew's secretary.

Ambassador Grew's efforts in terms of humility, although not as colorful as his stern rebukes, are equally effective. He strives to be approachable and makes himself an ordinary person. He is not like most prestigious foreigners, with a high self-worth. He often goes out in plain clothes and appears on the bustling streets of Tokyo. The Japanese all recognize him. (To be continued)

### Pope Broadcasts Christmas Message; Declares Five Principles of Peace; Rejects Power Politics and Eliminates Selfishness; New Order Should Be Based on Morality

Rome: Pope Pius XII broadcast yesterday from the Vatican Palace, stating that in this tragic era, the consolation of Christmas celebrations we receive is greater than before. He then described the pain of war and the work that should be done after the war, and recalled the Christmas message he issued a year ago, saying that some principles he created at that time are elements of peace, so that peace can be adapted to the principles of equality, justice, and honor, and can be passed down forever. Today, he wishes to reiterate several key points for concluding a lasting peace: (1) restrain resentment, (2) dissolve mistrust in international cooperation, (3) defeat the obscurantism of replacing justice with force, that is, restore morality between countries, (4) eliminate economic divisions, (5) eliminate selfishness.

Vatican: Pope Pius XII said in his Christmas broadcast to the world yesterday, "The Church does not favor any particular political system, and the 'new order' should be based on opposing the 'might makes right' doctrine." The Pope said, "If some people think that new forces should create a sound European 'new order,' we say that peace should be in harmony with the righteousness of justice, and the 'new order' should be based on the following points: (1) Curb the victory that is hated by people, and the methods and propaganda on which it is based. (2) The necessary trust and observance of the terms of relations between countries. (3) Overcome the 'might makes right' doctrine, and return international relations to morality. (4) The victory of some countries' economic theories. (5) Overcome the cold self-righteousness, this kind of doctrine pollutes the honor of the country, and should be replaced by sincere and genuine economic and legal cooperation between countries. We hope that the peers who establish the 'new order' can rely on justice." The Pope began his speech at 10:12 am Rome time (5:12 pm Shanghai time). He said, "This war will become the darkest era in history. The Church cannot favor any political system, only wants the morality and justice of all countries. Only when people understand this point can the term 'new order' have real meaning." The Pope finished his speech at 10:45 am Rome time (5:45 pm Shanghai time), and then prayed for people all over the world. (Associated Press dispatch, 25th)

### President Roosevelt's Christmas Broadcast; Hopes to Create a Better World Based on the Spirit of Christ

Pétain Pardons Frenchmen Arrested in Seville

Vichy: French Prime Minister Pétain granted amnesty on Christmas to all personnel under Tegol who were previously arrested in Seville. (Associated Press dispatch, 25th)

### Pétain's Heartfelt Speech; Calls on the Entire Nation to Unite; Not to Forget the Current National Crisis and Strive for Revival; Speaks Sadly of People Who Are Displaced and Homeless

Vichy: Today is Christmas Eve, and Marshal Pétain gave a special radio address to the people of the country. He said, "Tonight we should celebrate Christmas, but this year's Christmas is quite bleak, because many families are feeling the pain of separation from their loved ones. Recalling this day last year, the soldiers could still take leave and return home to spend the festival with their families. Now, most of them are gone, which is regrettable. Therefore, when we celebrate Christmas tonight, we must first think of the martyrs who sacrificed their blood for the glory of the country, and the prisoners of war who are still imprisoned in foreign lands. As for the latter, they may be able to participate in Mass in concentration camps tonight, or open the packages sent from their homes. Although they are imprisoned in foreign lands, far away from us, we have never forgotten them. In addition, there are a large number of people who do not know what Christmas dinner is, or even whether they will have food tomorrow. Santa Claus may not bring any toys for their children. In the deserted villages where refugees live, they may not even hear the church bells, and there are still many poor people and unemployed workers who are not rescued by the national relief association. Whenever we think of them, we cannot help but feel sad. The only thing that we should not forget is that Christmas is the birthday of the Savior, that is, the day when mankind has hope. The new France has been born in your pain and sacrifice, and we should do everything possible to promote it. Do not be disappointed, have full confidence in the future, and everyone should participate in the ongoing revival work, and work together to ensure that your children can celebrate Christmas happily in the future. In short, you must unite around me and overcome difficulties together. The stars will appear soon, leading us to the path of revival, so that France will be strong and prosperous. I sincerely wish you a Merry Christmas, long live France." (Havas dispatch, 24th)

### Vichy Government Orders Closure of Barrack Taverns

Vichy: The government issued an order yesterday to cancel the taverns in the barracks and dismiss the charming women who run these taverns.

### Christmas Scenes in European Countries; London; Enjoying Happiness in Air Raid Shelters

Stockholm: The British Ministry of Health and the London City Council are now doing their best to enable the people of London to celebrate Christmas under the current situation. According to reliable statistics, 1.6 million people spend the night in air-raid shelters in London, whether there is an alarm or not. Some of them are homeless, some of them have damaged houses and no building materials to repair them, and some of them do not want to get up in the middle of the night to take refuge and prefer to live in air-raid shelters, so the number is so large. The authorities have set up Christmas trees in the air-raid shelters, carried out cleaning campaigns, and specially formed bands to entertain the people in the air-raid shelters and make them forget the horrors of war. (Haitong dispatch, 25th)

### Berlin; Streets are Dark; Interiors are Bright

Berlin: Last night was Christmas Eve. About one million Christmas trees were lit in newspapers, public places, and private residences throughout Berlin. Although the streets are dark due to the implementation of lighting control, once you enter people's homes, the candles are brightly lit, and the tree lights are shining, filled with a peaceful and happy atmosphere. All shops, movie theaters, restaurants, and cafes closed early at 5 pm, so that everyone could go home and celebrate Christmas Eve. However, due to the implementation of lighting control to prevent air raid alarms, everyone stayed at home and did not go out, listening to special music on the radio. In addition to the usual booming business of toy stores this year, bookstores have also tripled their profits, because the people of Berlin all take advantage of the Christmas holidays to read books behind closed doors, so as not to go out for fun. If they encounter an alarm, they must take refuge in an air-raid shelter. (Haitong dispatch, 25th)

### Hitler Spends the Holiday with Soldiers on the Western Front; German Commander-in-Chief Comforts Frontline Soldiers

Berlin: German leader Hitler and German Commander-in-Chief General von Brauchitsch are now in a certain place in western Germany, spending Christmas with frontline soldiers and staff, as in last year. (Haitong dispatch, 25th)

Berlin: German Minister of Aviation Goering issued a Christmas Day message to all air force officers and soldiers today, declaring, "All air force officers and soldiers are requested to review, today we are celebrating the second Christmas of the war, and all officers and soldiers are still guarding the country and fighting bravely on the front line. As a result of the fierce fighting in recent days, you have won a major victory. You serve the country and cannot celebrate Christmas with your family and children, but colleagues in the army are as close as brothers, and their spirit is equal to that of family and children. With this spirit, I wish all officers and soldiers a Merry Christmas, and I hope that we have already won the victory by next Christmas and enjoy the joy of peace." (Haitong dispatch, 25th)

Berlin: When the officers and soldiers of the German long-range artillery team were celebrating Christmas in a village primary school, German Commander-in-Chief Field Marshal von Brauchitsch suddenly arrived, which greatly surprised all the officers and soldiers. After singing Christmas carols, von Brauchitsch gave a radio address to the officers and soldiers of the country, stating, "A year ago, I celebrated Christmas with the infantry on the Western Front. Now, a great and glorious year has passed. The Maginot Line, on which France relied last year, has proved to be unreliable today. Now, the ocean on which the United Kingdom relies will also prove to be unreliable when we deem it appropriate. We were originally comrades, so I would like to celebrate Christmas with you. Today, we all yearn for the loved ones at home, and I hope they will be as happy as we are. Last year, we stood in front of the French Great Wall. Today, we stand opposite the coast of the United Kingdom. The enemies on the mainland have all collapsed. Our task is only to defeat the last enemy to restore peace. Christmas is a festival of peace for the family, but it is also a festival for contemplation, recollection, and reflection on the meaning of life. This question is particularly serious for our German nation. Do we want to survive or die? Do we want to fight or surrender? We are the center and the greatest and most united nation in Europe, and we cannot evade this decision. The purpose of this war is to break the unilateral dominance of the United Kingdom and to forever eliminate the oppression of the United Kingdom and the disturbances it calls for, so as to achieve the natural 'new order' of Europe and to achieve the peace associated with Christmas. Today, the candles on the Christmas tree at home are burning, but we must not forget that this war to defend the country is not over. We all believe that Germany has won the victory, so we can celebrate tonight in peace. For several weeks, I have known that the German army is full of spirit and its fighting power is increasing. We must complete the mission for the Germans who have become benevolent. Our obligation is to follow the leader and sacrifice for the motherland. God has blessed us, and those who have faith will get his help. I wish all the soldiers a Merry Christmas." (Haitong dispatch, 25th)

Berlin: German Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Raeder said in a speech to all German naval personnel, "Now that the German army is celebrating its second Jesus Christmas in its great victory, I would like to extend my congratulations to all naval personnel who have participated in the victory. Today, I especially miss the combat personnel on the ships overseas, and I wish these officers and soldiers a Merry Christmas and successful voyages." (Haitong dispatch, 25th)

### Savings Passbook as a Christmas Gift

Berlin: General Goering is giving a savings passbook with a deposit of one thousand marks as a Christmas gift to each child of the air force soldiers who died in the current war. It is stipulated that those who receive this gift can only use it when they reach the age of twenty-one. If a woman needs to use it early due to special reasons such as marriage, she should apply to the Air Force Headquarters for approval. (Haitong dispatch, 25th)

### Anglo-American Policy Attempt to Urge Italy to Withdraw from the War: US Expresses Sympathy for Churchill's Remarks, Strong Reactions in Rome and Berlin

Washington: Individuals here welcome British Prime Minister Churchill's broadcast address to Italy, considering the Prime Minister's remarks to be very timely. It is heard that the US government's continued maintenance of Phillips as the ambassador to Italy is a sign that the US is gradually changing its policy toward Italy. From this, it can be seen that Anglo-American policies are now following a parallel path. It is widely believed that Phillips' return to Rome is the prelude to the United States trying to get Italy out of the war. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

Athens: Greek newspapers have all published British Prime Minister Churchill's broadcast address in large characters, stating that Christians should respond to it. Christian countries do not want to miss the opportunity of Christmas without expressing their desire for peace, seeking only the overthrow of oppressive Italian dictators and other criminals. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

Rome: The Italian government officially issued a commentary on Churchill's speech yesterday afternoon, briefly stating: (1) Anglo-Italian unity has been historically proven to be absurd. (2) After the last World War, Britain and Italy fought together, but Italy did not receive rewards commensurate with its sacrifices. (3) The League of Nations' sanctions against Italy were due to Britain's proposal. (4) The current European war is what Britain desires, without justification. Britain's guarantee to Poland is clear evidence of an attempt to encircle Germany. (5) Britain controls the gateway to the Mediterranean, and Italy has no freedom. (6) Britain provokes Italy's internal strife. (7) Italy is determined to fight for final victory. Churchill's remarks of compromise, made as the war enters an intense stage, although exhausting all means of provocation, deeply reveal the tragic situation Britain finds itself in. (Haitong dispatch, 25th)

Rome: Fascist authority editor Ansaldo warned the people that if Italy makes peace with Britain, it will be reduced to a dependency. After British Prime Minister Churchill's broadcast address to the Italian people severely criticized Mussolini, Ansaldo broadcast his warning in Rome amidst a flurry of commentary. Ansaldo said in a mocking tone, "Churchill's speech aims to produce the effect that the British army has failed to produce after its advance in Egypt, that is, to make Italy surrender." (International News Agency dispatch, 25th)

Berlin: British Prime Minister Churchill's broadcast address to the Italian people has once again aroused angry criticism from the German official communications agency, referring to it as a frivolous act by someone who has lost their sense of judgment. At the same time, Italian radio stations broadcast last night in Italian and other languages, refuting the British Prime Minister's remarks, briefly stating that Churchill hopes that the British army's victory in North Africa can demoralize the Italian people and promote the collapse of their domestic front, so he chose to make this speech on Christmas Eve, thinking that the Italians would hear his words as if hearing the gospel of angels. Churchill is greatly mistaken. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

Berlin: Everyone in Berlin commented on Churchill's speech, believing that Churchill was trying to alienate the Italian people from Prime Minister Mussolini, not knowing that the Italian people are determined to strive for final victory and absolutely obey Mussolini's leadership. Churchill's attempt to alienate German-Italian relations is also not worth commenting on. Churchill is clearly touting the future of the war, in order to inspire the British people.

### British Army Besieges Bardia, Cannon Fire Shakes the Sky: Italian Coastal Base in Libya Subjected to Fierce British Attacks, Flames Soaring

General Wavell issued an order to his most recent troops, saying, "Military operations are not yet complete, and we must strive for victory with the same spirit. The victory of our army in the western desert depends on collective wisdom and effort. Our army's prior full preparation, strict training, and proper command and deployment have enabled us to achieve this unprecedented victory."

### Allied Cooperation Strengthens Preparation, Value of Legal Tender Grows Stronger, China's Monetary Policy Proceeds Smoothly, Black Market Exchange Rates Do Not Affect Economy, British Banks Still Provide Supply But Refuse to Sell to Those Engaged in Arbitrage

The solid reserve of legal tender has been consistently trusted by both Chinese and foreigners. This time, the black market exchange rate in Shanghai was stimulated by rumors and suddenly contracted, mostly caused by speculators taking the opportunity to profit. Therefore, it immediately began to increase the supply. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance entrusted HSBC and Chartered Bank, both British banks, to try to maintain it and handle it at their discretion. Therefore, the exchange rate may fluctuate in the future, but if it is not on the right track, the two banks will stabilize it without a doubt.

Legal Tender Stands in an Invincible Position

In the past two years, what is enough to make people surprised in the financial field is not only that Chinese currency, although repeatedly frustrated, can still maintain an invincible position, and its ability to calmly cope with the war is truly commendable and greatly inspires Chinese and foreigners' confidence in the future of China's finances. Now, the US loan to China of 100 million US dollars and the British loan to China of 10 million British pounds, these two countries' friendly assistance to China, enable China's monetary policy to proceed smoothly, and greatly benefit their economic rights and interests in the Far East. The reserve of China's legal tender is announced on a regular basis, and the cash reserve is still sufficient, with no inflation.

Legal Tender High Priced in Occupied Areas

Although legal tender has been repeatedly suppressed in the occupied areas, facts prove that it still occupies a dominant position. The price of legal tender has always been higher than other miscellaneous currencies. Although the exchange rate of legal tender has been slightly affected by speculation and other aspects, China's financial and economic institutions are not affected by it. Because foreign exchange is important in international trade, it does not affect the domestic situation. Most Chinese people do not rely on imported goods for their livelihoods, so they are not affected by the low exchange rate in the occupied areas. There is no black market for foreign exchange in various places in the rear, only in Shanghai and Tianjin.

Black Market Foreign Exchange Still Maintained

A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency interviewed a banker yesterday, asking whether black market foreign exchange should still be maintained. According to reports, many domestic economists advocate that the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai does not need to be maintained. It was once recalled that when the "North China United Reserve Bank" was established, the Ministry of Finance held a financial conference in Hankou, and some people advocated that the black market foreign exchange did not need to be maintained, because this move would only facilitate Japan and its accomplices' arbitrage policy. It would be better to stop the supply with a quick solution. However, some people also advocated maintaining it, because if the black market is not maintained, it is a trick to destroy legal tender. The government weighed the pros and cons, and as a result, the black market foreign exchange was still maintained, and there was a Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund. However, if there is a large amount of arbitrage, they refuse to sell to avoid being exploited. Therefore, the exchange rate of black market foreign exchange has been lowered several times, and each reduction is caused by Japan's arbitrage.

Foreign Business Interests Definitely No Problem

As for dealing with the situation caused by the establishment of the "United Reserve Bank," the National Government has formulated specific measures. Because the confidentiality is strict, it is impossible to know the contents. What is known is that the target is only Japan, and the interests of foreign businesses will be maintained. The position of this port will be taken into account. Even in the Tianjin Concession, legal tender can still freely purchase foreign exchange, and the exchange rate is very high, which shows that no matter what the environment, there is absolutely no reason to panic about the exchange rate of legal tender. Since legal tender has ample funds and the cooperation of friendly countries, it will be able to cope with ease.

### Demolition of Houses and Road Construction in Western Shanghai Still Underway

The general situation of road construction beyond the boundaries in western Shanghai seems to have stabilized on the surface, but the work of demolishing houses and building roads in the alleys is still underway. Hundreds of poor people live in straw huts, suffering from hunger and cold, and lack food and clothing, which is very pitiful. At the same time, those who move are still in an endless stream. There are also advertisements for rentals in Nanshi, posted on the walls there, to attract residents whose houses have been demolished to move there. The opening hours of Zhuan'anbang Yongyuanbang and other places are still from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm. The work of "compiling and investigating the Baojia" by the Japanese side is proceeding non-stop in various wards. In addition, there are no more Japanese soldiers on Yuyuan Road, and the barbed wire fence at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Heping Road has been moved westward to the left side of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce since the day before yesterday, with seven or eight auxiliary police officers armed and guarding everything there.

### Current Public Concession Election: Japanese Attempt to Overturn, Submit Proposal to Election Committee, British and American Sides Vehemently Oppose

The Japanese are still not reconciled after failing in the election of directors of the current Board of Directors of the Public Concession, using the current election system as an excuse, claiming that it is not fair and must be thoroughly reformed. At the election committee meeting held at the Board of Directors meeting room at 2:00 pm on the 24th, the Japanese committee member Yasui submitted a proposal to reform the election system and explained the reasons. The British and American sides, based on the Land Regulations, objected to overturning the Land Regulations and accommodating the election system that favors one side. Therefore, the meeting had no results.

### American Ships Join Shanghai-Vietnam Route: Specializing in Transporting Rice and Coal to Shanghai

Because there are so many goods to be transported on the Shanghai-Vietnam route, especially rice and coal, which urgently need to be loaded onto ships and transported to Shanghai, the transportation industry in this city negotiated with American shipping companies to send ships to Vietnam. It is learned that in addition to the Wah Li, which will sail directly to Saigon, there will also be the Hai Sui, which will be stationed in Hong Kong from Shanghai and then transferred to Haiphong. It is expected that with the addition of American ships to the Shanghai-Vietnam route, the source of rice and coal in this city will be smoother.

Passengers to Hong Kong Return to Normal

Because the Japanese army withdrew from the Yunnan-Vietnam border on the Shanghai-Hong Kong route and the freight transport on the Yunnan-Burma Railway is unimpeded, the channels for goods to enter the mainland have increased. Because the Hong Kong government promulgated immigration regulations, most passengers traveled by ship earlier in the month, resulting in a sharp decrease in the number of passenger tickets sold on ships to Hong Kong in mid-month. According to what the reporter learned from the transportation industry yesterday, since the immigration regulations were extended for one month, the shipping industry in this city has not received any specific measures, and the number of people going to Hong Kong has returned to normal because the shipping companies are selling passenger tickets as usual.

Confiscated Cotton and Silk Cocoons Not Unloaded

The Italian ships "McNair" and "Lima Li", which sailed from Jiangbei to Shanghai and were detained by the Japanese naval police, have been held for many days. They have not been released as of yesterday, and the cotton and silk cocoons they are carrying have not been unloaded. At the same time, the German ship "Haifu", which sailed from Wenzhou to Shanghai, has also suffered the same fate. The relevant parties are currently negotiating with the Japanese on the goods loaded on the "Haifu". But even if the Japanese allow unloading, the losses will be considerable.

### Feng Bingnan Commemorates Mother's Birthday: Prints "Introduction to the Five Religions", Combined with Five Religious Lectures, Totaling Six Volumes

On June 29th of this year, Mr. Feng Bingnan held five religious lectures for five days for the 70th birthday of his mother, Madame Wen. The audience was unprecedentedly large. After the event, Feng compiled his commemorative birthday speech and Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang's lectures on Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, as well as Mr. Xu Songshi's on Christianity and Mr. Harod Cheng's on Islam, into a book of five religious lectures, and added Mr. Lin Songzun's "Introduction to Confucianism", Mr. Wang Boqian's "Introduction to Buddhism", "Introduction to Islam", Mr. Cheng Boqun's "Introduction to Christianity", and Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang's "Introduction to Taoism", forming a complete book of six volumes, all to promote the essence of each religion and explain the inherent morality. The style is simple and clear, and the wording is rigorous and correct. It can truly be called the door to virtue and the compass for dealing with the world. Modern students, with their heavy academic burdens, are trapped in their studies and have not glimpsed the path to self-cultivation and governing the world. Once they enter the world, they are at a loss. This is all because they lack cultivation at ordinary times and their knowledge of the classics is too broad to be quickly absorbed. This book can make up for their shortcomings. Therefore, it can be regarded as the only self-cultivation reference book for teachers and students above junior high school, and it can also make those who do not know the true spirit of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam, and who like to criticize recklessly, spontaneously develop a sense of admiration and humbly realize their inadequacy. It not only benefits the world and people's hearts but also opens up a path to the development of the five religions, showing that the truth in the world is unique and not divided by religious differences. The entire book is printed in regular script on Lian Shi paper and bound in Qian Zhuang style, with an antique flavor. In particular, at the previous religious lectures, pre-order coupons were distributed for each book. Now, coupon holders are invited to collect their books from the Feng Jishan Tang Jing Xiang Accounting Room at 137 Beijing Road, 12th floor, before January 15th, so that the remaining books can be made available to people from all walks of life. However, schools, libraries, and organizations can send letters with official seals, stating their addresses, to the accounting room, which will gradually send them as gifts.

### Price Limits on Nine Types of Foreign Rice Take Effect Today: Number One Saigon Rice Released, Rice Brokers Not Allowed to Sneak into the Market, Siam Rice Transactions Must First Be Registered on the Spot

The Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee, due to the rising rice prices and the disturbances outside the port, which are becoming increasingly fierce, believes that if a good plan is not devised, the future of the people's food will be unimaginable. Therefore, it convened the tenth emergency standing committee meeting yesterday, and it was agreed that suppressing rice prices and stabilizing the people's food is a matter of urgency, otherwise it will stimulate the sharp rise of other prices, which is no small matter. After long discussions, in addition to the strict enforcement of the new price limits for foreign rice that had been evaluated and determined on the 9th of this month, it was decided to evaluate and determine new price limits for nine types of foreign rice. The price limits still provide generous legal profits, and all transportation, water freight, military insurance, warehouse and other expenses are included. It has been decided to strictly enforce them starting today.

Brokers Temporarily Prohibited from Entering the Market for Two Weeks

The Rice Price Evaluation Committee resolved that, starting today, rice brokers will be temporarily prohibited from acting as intermediaries in the market for two weeks. In addition, yesterday, an order was issued to the market police to strictly monitor the sneaking of these profiteers into the market. If any rice brokers are found active in the market without holding certificates from foreign firms, they will be arrested and punished by the market police. The management committee decided to strictly enforce the restrictions on the qualifications of Siam rice sellers starting today. In addition to members of the Bean, Rice, and Miscellaneous Grain Trade Association, anyone who sells Siam rice in the market must first register with the market management office before they can sell it, in order to crack down on under-the-table deals and prevent illegal transactions such as speculation.

Banned Saigon Rice Released for Transport to Shanghai

The Saigon rice has already been loaded onto ships and is expected to arrive in early January. The purchase price of the foreign rice is very cheap, reportedly 79 or 80 yuan per bag.

### Roosevelt Wharf: Tugboat Detained

The British-owned Moller & Co.'s tugboat "Kaiming Moller," recently represented by Shanghai Qinheng Shipping Company, was scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Haikou on the 23rd of this month after customs clearance. However, while raising anchor at Roosevelt Wharf on the Bund, Japanese personnel suddenly intervened to prevent its departure and detained a Chinese compradore. Although the crew verbally protested at the time, they were unsuccessful in securing his release. Earlier this month, the "Mabelia" of the Rooth, Cobb & Co. was intended to sail from Shanghai to Zhejiang, but was intercepted by a Japanese warship and forced to return. The ship's Chinese compradore and a passenger were also detained by the Japanese and have not been released. This incident is therefore the second such occurrence. Currently, the "Kaiming" tugboat and cargo ship remain docked at Roosevelt Wharf. The incident involving the detained compradore has been reported to the consular authorities, requesting them to lodge a protest with the Japanese.

Following the Murder of Missionary Peng: Body Discovered

Ponson) went to preach there in 1913. On October 9th, he stayed overnight near Dou Town in Jing County, and was tragically killed the next day. His body was found three days later, one and a half li outside the town. Father Peng was 61 years old and had served the church for 27 years. Local Catholics expressed deep sorrow upon hearing the news.

### Shanghai West Police Authority Negotiations: Still No Progress; However, Japanese Newspaper Reports Implementation is Imminent; "Municipal Government" Has Directly Notified Tax Collection

According to the North-China Daily News, the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, stated that the negotiations regarding the Shanghai West police authority remain the same as two or three weeks ago, with no changes in the situation. According to the Japanese-language "Continental News," the Shanghai Municipal Government and Chen Gongbo have conducted numerous negotiations regarding the Shanghai West police authority issue and have reached a basic agreement. It is claimed that the "Municipal Government" will take over the police authority in the Shanghai West district before the end of January next year and is currently awaiting "approval" from Nanjing. The newspaper also stated that the "Municipal Government" will also "take over" the tax collection authority in the Shanghai West district and that Chen Gongbo will establish a "tax collection agency" specifically for collecting taxes in the Shanghai West district, directly under the "Bureau of Finance." The newspaper also mentioned the trial agreement on the police authority issue signed by the authorities of the Shanghai Municipal Council and Fu Xiaoan in February of this year, stating that this trial agreement will no longer be implemented due to the changed situation in Shanghai.

Notice to Manufacturers: Forced Tax Payment

According to the Shanghai Times, the "West District Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau" notified manufacturers in the West District on the 21st of this month that all factories located within the Chinese-controlled area are subject to tax collection by the "Municipal Government." However, apart from the notice, no other direct steps have been taken. It is reported that Chinese and foreign manufacturers have received this tax collection notice, which roughly states that since their factory is located within the Chinese-controlled area, they are requested to remit the quarterly taxes previously paid to the Shanghai Municipal Council to the "West District Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau" at 92 Jishi Fei'er Road within three days of receiving the notice. Yesterday (the 24th), according to well-informed sources, the addresses of the factories that received this notice are all located on the border roads outside the West District. Some foreign manufacturers have filed complaints with the Jing'an Temple Police Station after receiving the notice.

### High Court No. 2 and Special Court No. 1: Officials Request Salary Increase; Ministry of Justice Orders Both Courts to Provide Food and Lodging and Increase Salaries by 40 Yuan Each Starting from October

In September of this year, the High Court No. 2 Branch and the Special Court No. 1 received an order from the Ministry of Judicial Administration approving a 20% salary increase for judges and prosecutors and a 10% salary increase for clerks. Employees such as recorders were to receive a uniform salary increase of 20 yuan. All increases were to be retroactive to January of this year. The authorities of each court immediately issued the increases to the officials, and the

issue of salary increases for officials seemed to be settled. However, the cost of living continues to rise daily. Recently, the clerks of the High Court No. 2 and Special Court No. 1 jointly petitioned the Bureau of Finance for an increase in rice subsidies, while the judges and prosecutors also jointly requested a 60% salary increase (including the previous 20% increase, but the previous increase was calculated based on the basic salary, excluding subsidies. This time, the request for a 60% increase includes subsidies; only a 40% increase in the basic salary is requested). As for the assigned and trainee judges and prosecutors, they also

jointly requested a 150% increase. After the officials of the High Court No. 2 and Special Court No. 1 requested another salary increase, the Ministry of Judicial Administration recently ordered each court to open public canteens and dormitories. All officials can eat in the public canteens and bring their families to the dormitories. Those who do not wish to eat in the canteens will receive a monthly meal subsidy of 30 yuan, and those who do not wish to live in the dormitories will receive a monthly rent subsidy of 10 yuan. After receiving the order, the authorities of the High Court No. 2 and Special Court No. 1 decided to

uniformly increase each official's salary by 40 yuan starting from October, regardless of rank. The clerks of each court felt that this was too little and requested a further increase of 100 yuan for all employees, including the hired staff. The authorities of the High Court No. 2 and Special Court No. 1, considering the importance of this matter, in addition to issuing 40 yuan to each person yesterday in accordance with the Ministry's order, also submitted all the documents requesting increases from the judges, prosecutors, assigned trainee judges, prosecutors, and clerks to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for approval.

### Tushan Bay Barricades Not Yet Removed

Tushan Bay in Xujiahui, Shanghai West, is the only thoroughfare between the French Concession and Caohejing, Qibao, and other places. Farmers from the nearby suburbs travel this route. Some time ago, the Japanese suddenly erected barbed wire at the intersection of Pudong Road at the Tushan Bay triangle, prohibiting the entry and exit of various controlled goods. These circumstances have already been reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that starting yesterday, the Japanese have slightly relaxed the searches of people entering and exiting. Even the goods carried by the villagers are now allowed to pass through, unlike the previous strict controls. However, the barbed wire has not yet been removed, and Japanese military police from the Japanese military police detachment stationed at the former guard team site on Pudong Road are jointly inspecting pedestrians and vehicles with the "police."

### Human Waste Disposal in the Public Concession: Japanese Firm Takes Over; Bureau Reportedly Makes Decision

According to a report from Japanese sources, the disposal of human waste from the lanes and residences in the Public Concession will be handled by the Japanese firm Ooni Masatoshi starting from January of next year.

If this is the case, whether it will cause a backlash against the existing cleaners and the so-called "Manure Kings" regarding their rights and work, there is no word yet.

### Chinese Police in French Concession: Yu Qiaqing Acts as Mediator; Contacted the French Consulate General, etc.; Satisfactory Response Expected in the Next Few Days

The issue of Chinese police in the French Concession requesting improved treatment has been delayed for two weeks without resolution. The Chinese police have all demonstrated a strong sense of responsibility, and the security of the concession has not been affected in the slightest, which has earned the praise of the citizens. Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Zhao Zhiyou, leaders of the Shanghai business community, believe that if this issue is not resolved soon, it will not be in the best interests of society. Therefore, they are mediating between the French side and the Chinese police and have contacted the French Consulate General and the police authorities several times. Due to the sincerity of the French side, after several discussions, it has been decided to give a satisfactory response within the next few days. At that time, representatives of the Chinese police will be summoned again for final negotiations. As for the Mutual Aid Association of Chinese Police in the French Concession, its purpose is purely to handle welfare matters, and since the Public Concession has already established one first, the business community also expresses its support and is willing to provide assistance. Therefore, the approval of the French authorities should not be a problem. It is expected that this matter will be completely resolved in the near future.

### Celebrating Weekly Revival Day Yesterday: All Sectors in High Spirits; Supporting National Policy to Complete the Great Task of Revival; Promoting Thrift, Savings, and Donation Movement for Disaster Relief

Yesterday was the National Revival Day and also the combined anniversary of the Yunnan and Zhaoqi uprising, and it also coincided with the Western Christmas holiday. Residents from all sectors celebrated enthusiastically. All Chinese and foreign agencies, schools, banks, money shops, and foreign companies and firms also followed the usual practice of taking holidays, and the atmosphere was exceptionally lively. All sectors of the Chinese community believed that the Yunnan uprising laid a new foundation for the revolutionary cause, and that the National Revival Day marked the beginning of the revival of the great Chinese nation. Their spirits were particularly high. However, due to the special circumstances, they followed the central government's regulations and did not hold extravagant commemorative ceremonies. All public groups sent telegrams to the highest leader to pay their respects and to express their gratitude to all the soldiers. In order to support national policy and complete the great task of national revival, all sectors unanimously intensified the promotion of thrift, savings, conscience donations, and the three major movements of disaster relief. They also decided to assist various charitable organizations in expanding winter relief efforts to help the poor in the streets of Shanghai. The police authorities of the two concessions increased the number of detectives patrolling the roads and inspecting suspicious pedestrians and vehicles to ensure public order. However, some passages and bridges were not closed. The Shanghai Municipal Council and the consulates of various countries followed the usual practice of taking a two-day holiday for Christmas and will resume work tomorrow.

### Two Major Christmas Day Murders: Doctor Dies by Bullet; Dancers Sniped at After All-Night Revelry; Yang Longsheng Claims to Seek Treatment and Commits Murder with a Gun

Yesterday was the Christmas holiday. Unexpectedly, on this day of celebration, two major murders occurred one after another in the British and French concessions, spoiling the festive atmosphere. The details of the two cases are recorded below.

Dancing All Night: Pleasure Exhausted, Returning Home

A Ningbo man named Wu Zhijiang, 27 years old, wanted to enjoy the festive Christmas Eve, so he went dancing with his dance partner at the Grand World Rooftop Gaofeng Ballroom. Feeling that it was very enjoyable, he led two Gaofeng dance hall girls to the Jue Lu Ballroom on Yu Qiaqing Road at 1:00 AM, hugging and dancing. By 5:00 AM, Wu felt tired, and the two dancers also wanted to leave. He paid the bill and accompanied the two women, talking and laughing closely together despite the freezing wind along the way as they headed south.

Shot Suddenly at the Fuzhou Road Intersection

Unexpectedly, when Wu was walking to the entrance of the Da Mei Ballroom at the intersection of Fuzhou Road, a man suddenly jumped out from the roadside and fired two shots at Wu without asking any questions, both hitting him in the abdomen. He fell to the ground in a pool of blood. The murderer, seeing that his purpose had been achieved, immediately fled and disappeared. After the Laozha Police Station received the news, they immediately sent an ambulance to take Wu to the Renji Hospital for treatment. Because Wu had been shot twice, both bullets entering from the front of the abdomen and exiting from the back, his condition was extremely serious and his life was in critical danger. It is reported that Wu works somewhere in Shanghai West.

Claiming to Seek Treatment: Sniping the Doctor

The assassination in the French Concession occurred at 10:45 AM yesterday. At that time, a young man went to the Minsheng Hospital at No. 5, Kangji Lane, 59 Kangti Road, and paid three yuan for a consultation, claiming to be seeking treatment for his illness. Wu Weizhong, the director of the hospital, a native of Pudong, performed the examination for him (in the operating room on the second-floor pavilion). Unexpectedly, when Dr. Wu lowered his head to examine the affected area, the young man suddenly pulled out a pistol and fired a shot at his head, hitting the right temple and penetrating the left temple. Dr. Wu immediately fell dead on the ground. The murderer, seeing this, immediately went downstairs and fled.

Murderer Arrested: Claiming Revenge

As a result, the murderer fled to the entrance of Xiangshun Lane on Caishi Road, where he was captured by Detective No. 209. A pistol and six bullets were confiscated. After being taken to the police station, he identified himself as Yang Longsheng, 26 years old, a native of Pudong. He claimed that Wu had colluded with bandits and harmed his entire family, causing his parents to die tragically. Therefore, he had planned to seek revenge. He had pretended to be ill and sought treatment on the 16th and 20th, but had no opportunity to strike. According to reports, the deceased, Wu Weizhong, whose style name was Shaoqing, was 51 years old. His wife, Jiang, had divorced him, and he had remarried to Xiao. He had two sons, Daonan and Zhengnan. The French police are investigating the true details.

### Brawl in Changle Teahouse

At around 4:00 PM yesterday, a large group of hooligans in the Changle Teahouse at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Hubei Road in the Public Concession had a dispute over something. The two sides then started fighting, using knives, sticks, and other sharp weapons. The police station sent police officers to arrest them, and they scattered like birds and beasts. During the fight, a local hooligan named Ye Baoquan (22 years old) was slashed three times in the head and was seriously injured. He was sent to the hospital for treatment.

### Reproduction of Secret Code Telegrams: Fine Imposed

The American company Acme Code Company has been publishing the Acme Code Telegram Book for many years. On the 14th of this month, someone suddenly reported to the company that Shi Xinhua, the owner of the Wenhua Printing House at No. 15, Lane 406, Shanhai Pass Road, was reproducing the book. After Mr. Haig of the company verified this, he reported it to the Central Police Station, who ordered detectives to go there and arrest Shi Xinhua. At the time, Niu Yongji, the owner of the Shanghai Old Bookstore on Traffic Road, Sima Road, was also involved. The detectives arrested and sent him to Special District Court No. 1. The police lawyer Peng Qixin filed a public prosecution against him for counterfeiting trademarks and selling illegal goods under Articles 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday, Judge Zhan Liangce took the bench for the trial. Because the police had no other findings during the investigation, after the two defendants were interrogated separately, the debate began. The defendants were represented by lawyers Song Yao and others. At the end of the debate, Judge Zhan announced the verdict in court: Shi Xinhua was found not guilty, and Niu Yongji was fined 1,500 yuan. During the appeal period, each was allowed to pay a 2,000 yuan security deposit.

Five Robbers Commit Robbery in Daxin Hotel: Claiming to be from the Military Police; Over 6,000 Yuan in Cash Robbed

Room 318 of the Daxin Hotel at No. 108 Hubei Road was rented by Wang Ronggen, a native of Pudong, on the 12th of this month. Wang worked in the Gongxing Flower Factory in Siyuan Cang, his hometown, and came to Shanghai to sell floral clothing. He had placed the proceeds in a shoe box under the bed. At around 7:15 AM yesterday, five robbers suddenly broke into the room. Two were armed with pistols. They intimidated and threatened Wang and his younger brother, Wenbo, claiming to be from the military police and accusing Wang and others of being guerrillas. They then ransacked the room and took all the proceeds from the sale of floral clothing, totaling 6,070 yuan in cash, before fleeing. The victim reported the robbery to the police station and requested an investigation.

Kidnapping of Shi Fuyuan Using a Fake Dai Family Car: Complex Circumstances Require Detailed Investigation; Conflicting Testimony from Four Suspects, One Released

Guo Yunqing from Beiping, Bao Wenqing from Tongzhou, Xu Wei from Xuzhou, and Xu Abiao from Ningbo, colluded on the morning of the 15th of this month at Room 529 of the Grand China Hotel at No. 200 Yu Qiaqing Road. They agreed to borrow the private black-license car of Dai Buxiang, the manager of the hotel, and drive to the entrance of the Xinde Hospital at No. 137 Yuanchang Road to kidnap Shi Fuyuan, the owner of the hospital, who was from Ningbo.

They illegally detained him in Jiangwan, a Chinese-controlled area, demanding a ransom of 20,000 yuan. The case was discovered by Chinese and foreign detectives from the Hongkou Police Station, who rescued the victim and arrested Guo Yunqing and three others. They also sent a suspect, Fan Genfu from Taizhou, to the First Special District Court for detention. Fan Genfu hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to represent him. President Huang Risheng

attended the court for further hearing

The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that after further investigation, it was confirmed that Bao Wenqing was not involved in the case and requested his release. He also said that the circumstances of the kidnapping of Shi Fuyuan by Guo and the other three defendants were complex and required detailed investigation. The victim was still not present in court today and requested another postponement. When questioning Guo Yunqing and others, their testimony was inconsistent. The court ordered them to be detained and adjourned the case for further investigation. The police station did not prosecute Fan Genfu and allowed him to be released.

### Labor Strike at Two Cotton Mills: Direct Negotiations

Workers at the Xinniu and Xinyu Textile Mills in Shanghai went on strike the day before yesterday. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, someone was preventing workers from entering the factory at the factory gate. The police station sent a police car to the scene, and the workers were able to safely enter the factory. Since the workers all understood the importance of the situation, they have already returned to work in the factory. As for the issue of wage increases, both labor and management are willing to negotiate in good faith and do not want a third party to intervene. However, for the sake of safety, most of the workers are staying in the factory to avoid being threatened outside the factory.

### Thugs Resist Arrest: Detective Shot and Killed; Ordering the Search, Thugs Drew Guns to Resist Arrest; One Thug Killed, Stray Bullet Wounds a Woman

At 6:25 PM yesterday, three or four thugs were loitering near Kangnao Road and Xiaoshadu Road in Shanghai West, plotting something illegal. A patrolling detective happened to see them and ordered them to stop, intending to search them. The thugs turned to flee. At that time, Chinese Detective Hao Shangqin (No. 329), a native of Tianjin, bravely pursued them. The thugs drew a gun and fired a shot at him, hitting the detective in the chest. Because the bullet hit a vital organ, he fell to the ground and died on the spot. The thugs then fled in different directions, firing their guns to resist arrest. The detectives also drew their pistols and returned fire. Many shots were exchanged. As a result, one thug was killed, and the remaining thugs escaped into the darkness. When the detectives were fighting, a pedestrian, Liu Wu (27 years old), was wounded in the right leg by a stray bullet. The police summoned an ambulance to send Liu Wu to Guangren Hospital for treatment. The bodies of the Chinese detective and the thug were sent to the police hospital for transfer to the coroner's office for an autopsy.

### Private Shanghai Middle School Owes Donations: Sued by the Shanghai Municipal Council; Court Summons Defendants, No One Responsible

The private Shanghai Middle School was originally run by Chen Jicheng. Later, it was reported to be run by Lin Kanghou, and the elementary school was run by Yu Qiaqing. The school owed a large amount of donations to the Shanghai Municipal Council and was recently sued by the Council in the Civil Court of the First Special Court for failing to pay the donations. According to the indictment, the court summoned the Shanghai Middle School in the Civil Court of the First District, but no one responsible appeared in court. The attorney representing the plaintiff, the Shanghai Municipal Council, stated to the court that according to the plaintiff's investigation, the person in charge of the private Shanghai Middle School was Lin Kanghou, but it was reported that Lin was about to leave Shanghai. The person in charge of the elementary school was Yu Qiaqing. Judge Tao showed the summons for the private Shanghai Middle School returned to the plaintiff's agent, instructing the plaintiff to investigate and report the actual person in charge of the private Shanghai Middle School in order to issue another summons. The attorney representing the plaintiff requested the court to issue another summons to the private Shanghai Middle School, hoping that someone responsible would appear in court. At the same time, the plaintiff would also conduct further investigation. After considering the matter, the court decided to postpone the summons.

### Civilian Women and Children's Hospital Opens at New Location - Open House Today

The Shanghai Civilian Women and Children's Hospital, having moved from Weihaiwei Road to its new location at 995 Connaught Road in June of this year, has added new buildings and renovated the original premises into a modern hospital. The facilities are largely in place, and the gardens and lawns have also been laid. Mr. Pan Zhiquan, Chairman of the Board, Dr. Wang Yihui, the Hospital Director, and the other directors have sent out invitations for a tea party to be held at the new Connaught Road location on December 16th from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM to welcome guests to view the hospital's work over the past two and a half years.

The hospital was originally established to serve refugee mothers. Later, amidst the soaring prices, when everyone suffered, the issue of childbirth for working-class women in Shanghai became quite serious. Costs were high, and free hospitals were few and far between. Recognizing this, the hospital's board of directors resolutely decided to continue operations and merged with the former Weihaiwei Road Refugee Children's Hospital to become the permanent Shanghai Civilian Women and Children's Hospital. At the same time, with the enthusiastic financial support of the Shanghai Women and Children's Welfare Association, the site of the hospital was purchased and leased to the hospital for a nominal rent of one yuan, for the benefit of the common people.

The hospital provides all its services free of charge, except for voluntary donations. Inpatient maternity care, including ten days of accommodation, meals, delivery, and medical expenses, are all waived. In addition, outpatient services for both boys and girls are also free.

In addition to providing delivery services for mothers, the hospital also emphasizes infant feeding and treatment for family members. There are two outpatient clinics: one in cooperation with the Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association on Xiaoshadu Road, and the other at the original hospital site. Simultaneously, the hospital cooperates with the Family Planning Association to disseminate family planning knowledge through public lectures and family hygiene information. Recognizing the large number of impoverished people in our country, most of whom cannot afford medical care or delivery services, the hospital deems it essential to train experienced midwifery personnel. Therefore, it cooperates with renowned midwifery schools in Shanghai, accepting their top students to the hospital for six months to one year of practical training. If their performance is excellent, they are sent back to school. To date, dozens have been trained in this way.

The hospital delivers over a thousand babies annually, averaging eighty to ninety per month. Outpatient visits also average eighty to ninety per day. Its work is very rigorous, resulting in low maternal and infant mortality rates, with fewer than one maternal death per thousand and fewer than one infant death per hundred. Recently, prenatal check-ups for pregnant women have been added to the outpatient services, providing guidance at all times. In one year, this work has been remarkably effective, further reducing maternal and infant mortality rates. This initiative is being actively pursued.

To increase services to the common people and accelerate the provision of out-of-hospital deliveries, the hospital still needs an ambulance, a delivery bed, and several laboratory instruments. In addition, it hopes that philanthropists in Shanghai will generously contribute to the regular expenses of 50,000 yuan for next year.

The hospital's management is entirely in the hands of women and children's health experts. The Honorary Director is Dr. Bu Huade, director of Hongren Hospital. The Medical Director is Dr. Shen Jiying, former physician at Peking Union Medical College and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau. Resident physicians Wu Huizhen, Hua Shoumin, and the German physician Mei You rotate in charge. In addition, physicians Deng Lapa, Wang Shuzhen, Xu Naili, Xu Shixun, and Fan Haishan are also assisting and providing guidance. The hospital's directors are all prominent figures, both Chinese and foreign. The Managing Directors are Mr. Pan Zhiquan (Chairman), Dr. Wang Yihui, Dr. Shi Siming, Dr. Shen Jiying, Ms. Yan Yaqing, Mrs. Yu Yingjie, Mr. Li Guixi, Yu Zhongkui, and Mr. Lu Meiyi, who administer the hospital's affairs.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the weather in Tianjin and the surrounding areas of Shandong is clear and cold, with gentle to increasingly strong northwesterly winds. The weather here and in the East China Sea is cloudy or overcast and cold, with strong northerly to easterly winds. Snowfall is occurring around Korea. Furthermore, in the 24 hours preceding 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 49.5 degrees and the lowest was 17.8 degrees.

### Lixin Accounting School Adds Short-Term Training Classes

The Lixin Accounting Tutoring School at 406 Jiangxi Road has seen a continuous increase in enrollment in recent years, with this term reaching over 1,800 students, which can be described as enthusiastic. However, the only regret is that after completing the courses at the school, students have full preparation for employment but do not have the qualifications to transfer to other high schools or university business programs to continue their studies. In view of this, the school, following the regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Education, has applied to open elementary and advanced short-term accounting training classes to remedy this. The elementary class recruits junior high school graduates, and the advanced class recruits senior high school graduates, providing them with one year of training. Those who pass the examination at the end of the term will be issued a certificate. Those who wish to seek employment can be introduced to jobs by the Lixin Accounting Vocational Consulting Center. Those who wish to continue their education can, at the elementary level, apply to the second year of the business program at other senior high schools, and at the advanced level, apply to the second year of the business school at various universities. This plan has now been approved by the Ministry of Education for implementation, so it is decided to open an elementary and advanced training class in the spring of next year. It is also heard that students who previously studied at the school, if they are indeed junior or senior high school graduates, can also join the remedial training class to make up for other required courses not studied and obtain the same qualifications.

### Interport Football Tournament Has Been Abandoned - Difficult to Book Sufficient Berths - Leading to Cancellation of the Shanghai Team's Trip

The annual Hong Kong-Shanghai interport football tournament, this year's (1940 season), was to be hosted by Hong Kong. Not long ago, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Football Associations repeatedly announced that despite the escalating tensions in the Far East, the interport match would be held in Hong Kong as scheduled, barring unforeseen circumstances, and that the Shanghai team would depart for Hong Kong around the end of the Lunar Year. However, it is understood that this eagerly anticipated 1941 Hong Kong-Shanghai interport football tournament has now been cancelled. The reason is that since the changes in the Far East situation, there have been far fewer ships, and voyages have become irregular. Furthermore, due to the relationship of demand exceeding supply, it is very difficult to book sufficient berths. The Shanghai team representatives initially selected to go to Hong Kong also have official duties, and they can only take this very short, prescribed vacation to make this expedition. Adding to this are other very numerous issues. Therefore, the Shanghai Western Football Club convened an executive committee meeting at the end of last week to discuss the matter, and the result was a decision to cancel this year's interport match and to send a special letter to the Hong Kong Football Association, stating the difficulty in fulfilling the promise to go to Hong Kong.

### Observations on the Tightening of the Black Market Exchange Rate - Believing There Is No Reason for Further Tightening

Recently, the foreign exchange market in Shanghai has become severely tight, and gold prices have soared. The US dollar has contracted sharply from 5.80 yuan to 5.375 yuan, and the British pound has retreated from 3 and three-eighths to 3 and one-quarter. Gold has risen from a long-standing 5,600-5,700 yuan to 6,600-6,700 yuan. This is nothing more than using the upcoming opening of a certain bank and the anticipated decline of the legal tender as an excuse for drunken speculation. As a result, everything has risen in price, causing alarm and unease. However, it is not well known that the legal tender has a value that is resistant to the ravages of time; this is not boasting, but there is a reason for it. Try to think about it and you will know that the words are not groundless.

(1) The legal tender foreign exchange rate in Tianjin is stronger than in Shanghai. When the so-called "Joint Reserve Bank" was established, the forced confiscation in the occupied areas of North China was the first step, followed by the threat of capital punishment. Coercion and extortion were used to the extreme, and people rushed to obtain foreign exchange from the Shanghai market. Consequently, the National Government sent a telegram to confront the situation. At that time, the exchange rate in Tianjin had fallen to as low as 3.75 yuan per US dollar and 2 and a half per British pound. The pressure faced by the legal tender could not be said to be light. This was an economic strategic retreat, which was not related to the overall situation. Now, the pine and cypress stand tall and strong, and the foreign exchange rate in Tianjin is 6.34375 yuan per US dollar and 4 and one-eighth per British pound. The facts are all there; is it not a miracle?

(2) Before the war, the foreign exchange rate was controlled by the Central Bank. Later, due to various reasons, the black market foreign exchange rate was based on HSBC's quoted prices for expansion and contraction. Now there are rumors that, starting from the 23rd of this month, it will no longer quote prices or maintain the exchange rate. Upon investigation, the bank reduced the quoted prices for both the US dollar and the British pound by 0.0625 on the 17th and further reduced them by 0.125 on the 20th. This was originally to exclude speculators from taking advantage of the situation and to test the natural resistance level of the legal tender. This is truly a technical issue of maintaining the foreign exchange rate. Even if the bank does not quote prices or maintain the black market exchange rate, there is absolutely no problem. May I ask if Tianjin has this bank quoting prices or maintaining the exchange rate? Why is the exchange rate in Tianjin stronger than in Shanghai?

(3) The international exchange rate is 5.83 yuan to the US dollar in New York and 3 and three-eighths to the British pound in London. Moreover, the Chinese foreign debt in London has recently soared. If it is said that the legal tender in Shanghai should decline, I do not know how to imagine that.

(4) Even if a certain bank opens and issues currency, it has already clearly stated that the "Joint Reserve Bank Notes" in North China will temporarily maintain the status quo, and "military scrip" will assist the circulation of "new currency." Its circulation area extends north to Bengbu and west to Anqing. Southern China and Hainan are not allowed to circulate it. Confined to the dotted lines of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, it is inherently deficient and its future can be known. May I ask, with the measurement of a certain party, would it be willing to use "new currency" to buy its depleted foreign exchange? Would it be willing to buy train tickets for point-to-point transportation? Would it be willing to buy its supplies? Taking ten thousand steps back, even if the above-mentioned things could be achieved at will, would it be able to overcome the "military scrip" backed by force? The amount of "Joint Reserve Bank Notes" issued in North China is 600 million yuan, and the amount of "military scrip" issued in Central China is over 10 million yuan. The facts are all there. May I ask what pressure is there? If the pressure is insufficient, let us talk about elasticity. It will be seen that after the bank opens, the legal tender will become even more sharp.

(5) The Central Bank in Chongqing originally quoted 6 and one-eighth for the British pound. When the Burma Road was blocked, in order to gain control over foreign exchange and encourage the export of local goods, it was specially changed to 4 and one-eighth. At this time, there is no possibility of changing the quoted price. (1) The Burma Road has been opened, (2) Large amounts of loans from the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union provide ample foreign exchange reserves, (3) At a time when the free China area is vigorously suppressing commodity prices, how can it stimulate rising commodity prices, (4) the algorithm for the Central Bank's commercial quoted prices.

Therefore, it is not known where the rumor that the US dollar will be changed to 4 and a half yuan is based.

(6) The Shanghai trade deficit: yesterday's report stated that Shanghai had a trade surplus of 600 million yuan by the end of November of the 29th year of the Republic of China, which was undoubtedly calculated according to the statutory exchange rate of the customs gold unit. Based on reality, the trade deficit is about 200 million yuan, which is a great improvement compared to the same time last year. At this time last year, the US dollar was 8 yuan and the British pound was 4 and a half. Now, with a legal tender price of 6 and a half US dollars and 4 and one-quarter British pounds, how can it be considered extravagant?

What has been said above may be recognized as being biased towards one side, but those who speculate and take advantage of the situation, abandon their positions, and make trouble unreasonably are harming themselves and others. The facts are there, and they cannot be forced. (Ping Ping)

### China Merchants Bank Opens Today - Chinese Bank Notes to Be Exchanged Tomorrow

Yesterday was the Yunnan Uprising Memorial Day and Christmas Day, and both Chinese and foreign banks in the city were closed for the holiday. Today, China Merchants Bank is open for business as usual, while foreign banks will continue to be closed for one more day as usual. The Bankers' Association Joint Reserve Society, acting as the clearing agent for China-Italy Bank notes, issued a special circular to all clearing banks, stating briefly that the Zhejiang Industrial Bank stated in its letter that the bank would be closed for the holiday on the 26th to act as the clearing agent for China-Italy Bank notes. Therefore, all matters relating to China-Italy Bank notes will be submitted for clearing on the 27th.

### Another Joint Stock Limited Money Shop - Shende Soon to Open

Preparations have been completed, and Guohua Industrial and Commercial Pudong Bank Tongrun Fuyuan and Gengyu Money Shops have been entrusted as subscription collection points. The business address has been selected as No. 8 Wangyunli, Paoqiuchang, Henan Road. It is said that it will soon start operations. (Fu)

### Sugar Prices Rise Sharply and Then Slightly Decline

Yesterday, the sugar market, due to several days of strong gains, had reached a considerable level, and buyers were scarce, so prices softened. The Association drew the market. The highest price for coarse and white sugar was 80 yuan. The external warehouse price for 24 coarse white sugar was 81 yuan. The Western warehouse price for Taikoo coarse white B mark was 80 and a half yuan. Yesterday, the external futures for the second call of coarse white sugar for delivery in mid-January were 79.7 yuan. Dutch red sugar for spot delivery was initially 64.3 yuan, then 64 yuan, and finally 64.1 yuan, down 0.4 yuan. There were no transactions for the Taikoo coarse white upper grade. HX mark Western warehouse was 77.2 yuan, small octagonal, and Dongwu Green was marked at 60 yuan, and Bowl Green was marked at 59 yuan, up 1-2 yuan. There were no transactions yesterday.

### Hainan Dried Longan - Prices Rise by More Than Ten Yuan

Since the sharp decline in prices of Hainan dried longan, most merchants have been unwilling to sell cheaply due to cost considerations. Furthermore, recent supplies have been scarce, leading to a market rebound. Yesterday, dozens of packages were sold, with prices rising by more than ten yuan. However, considering production costs, it is still difficult to break even.

### Miscellaneous Grains and Cloth - Transported to Nanyang

Yesterday's exports saw brisk sales of miscellaneous grains. 435 packages of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong, 1,810 packages to Singapore, and 250 packages to Little Luzon. 1,000 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Hong Kong. For sesame, 230 packages were shipped to Hong Kong, 200 packages to Singapore, and 30 packages to Little Luzon. Additionally, 1,230 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 1,030 pieces of piece goods to Hong Kong, 125 pieces to Singapore, and 155 pieces to Little Luzon.

### Economic Jottings

— Feng Liutang

Water Pipe

I have always believed that the most hygienic and scientifically interesting way to smoke is with a water pipe. This is because the smoke from a water pipe is filtered through water and then travels through a tube before entering the mouth, undergoing several twists and turns. This makes the smoke taste milder and more mellow, unlike the direct throat hit of a dry pipe. Furthermore, since the smoke is filtered through water, the tar remains in the water. Substances like nicotine, even if mixed with water, will inevitably enter the body to a lesser extent than with a dry pipe.

When China invented the use of water pipes is simply impossible to trace. However, we know it was not before the early Qing dynasty. The term "water pipe" was not found until the tenth month of the 41st year of Qianlong's reign, and even then, it was only in a simple sentence stating that the emperor, at the request of Imperial Academician Cao, forbade smoking water pipes. The fact that water pipes were prohibited indicates that they were already popular at the time.

However, during the Xianfeng era, a dispute arose between water pipe and dry pipe smokers. The story goes that during the eighth and ninth years of Xianfeng's reign, Wang Youling rose through the ranks under the patronage of He Guiqing, the Governor-General of Liangjiang. Within a few years, he went from being a salt commissioner to the Jiangsu Financial Commissioner, becoming mutually reliant with the Governor-General and treating the Governor with disdain. The Governor, Zhao Dezhe, eventually resigned due to illness. Zhao was succeeded by Xu Youren of Guian, who was transferred from Hunan Financial Commissioner to Governor of Jiangsu. Having heard of Wang's arrogance, Xu sought a way to curb him. When Wang first paid his respects, two handsome servants on either side of him held white copper pipes, preparing to serve water pipe. Xu said to him, "As a Financial Commissioner, are you still unaware of the official custom? When a Financial Commissioner visits the Governor, he is only allowed to smoke a dry pipe, not a water pipe. Even if you are exceptionally talented, you cannot violate the established rules." He immediately waved the two handsome servants away, leaving Wang stunned and speechless, losing face as he left.

Water pipe containers are made of copper, and some are made of silver, but most are white copper. Water pipe containers are more aesthetically pleasing than dry pipes and have many accessories, such as tongs for holding tobacco, a pick for cleaning the pipe, a brush for removing ash, and a chain connecting the pipe. The container itself is clean, white, and shiny. Later, the custom of blowing out the tobacco butt became popular, eliminating the need to remove the pipe head and blow into it, which required two steps.

Water pipe tobacco includes Lanzhou water pipe tobacco, which is blue in color and therefore called "blue strips." In addition, there is "pure silk," which is yellow in color. "Skin silk" is best produced in Fujian province and is the mildest and most mellow, making it of higher quality.

Once, I was talking to Mr. Zhu Zhiyao and we discussed water pipes. I praised their method as excellent, believing that they would one day become popular again, and that they have scientific value. Mr. Zhiyao said to me, "Indeed, the Chinese are most skilled at small techniques but cannot apply them to large industries, which is a great pity. You know that steelmaking uses coke, but you don't know that the success of modern steelmaking is due to the Chinese water pipe." I was surprised and thought he was joking. Mr. Zhiyao said, "No! It is true. Initially, foreigners used coke in steelmaking, but during the smelting process, fine particles of charcoal and dust would often become mixed in the steel. If the steel contained even a small amount of impurities, the finished product would not be durable, and they suffered from this without being able to improve it. Then, a Westerner who was a steelmaking technician saw a Chinese water pipe and suddenly understood. So, he imitated the method, also passing coal gas through water, thereby removing the ash and dust mixed in the gas. As a result, the steel produced was unbreakable, leading to today's success." I have often said that China has various inventions but cannot develop them into science, making them valued by the world, not unlike the medicine that prevents chapped hands!

### A Minor Issue Regarding Time in Negotiable Instruments (Continued)

— Ji Runmo

——Some Thoughts on Returned Checks at the Bund——

For the sake of prudence, starting next year, Chinese banks will also follow the example of foreign banks and implement Saturday afternoon closures. This unavoidable measure, for the banks themselves, is based on actual difficulties and is by no means as unreasonable as outsiders might assume. However, it will inevitably affect depositors. In terms of check clearing, if the return check time on the Bund remains the same as this year, it will be inconvenient for depositors who deposit checks from the Bund. For example, if Mr. A deposits a sight draft from a foreign bank with a certain bank on a Friday, in the current year, the check can be cleared no later than 2:00 PM on Saturday if there are no return check issues. However, next year, due to Saturday afternoon closures, the checks that could originally be cleared will lose the opportunity to be cleared. Adding in the Sunday closure, checks deposited on Friday will effectively have to wait until Monday to confirm whether they can be cleared. Sacrificing two days of interest is a small matter, but directly affecting the convenience of collection is a major issue. It seems that there is a need for discussion and remedy! As of now, the check clearing house has not yet stipulated the clearing time for Saturdays next year, and there is no sign of any solution for the return check time on the Bund. In view of this inconvenience, perhaps some remedy will be found! It is my humble opinion that the return check time on the Bund, in addition to having a standard time, should be brought forward as much as possible to prevent the aforementioned inconvenience. I would like to ask for your esteemed opinion on this.

### The Future of Hope

— Song Yang

It's not necessarily a bad thing for a person to have "hope," because at least they have an awareness of dissatisfaction with reality and yearning for the future. Things like hoping that rice prices will fall, hoping that life will be better next year, and so on. The continuous forward development of society relies on this "hope" to drive it.

But "hope is different from fantasy." It must have a realistic basis and subjective effort, and then it can be achieved step by step. This simple formula can be said to be known to everyone. But until now, we can still hear a kind of argument that "hopes that robbers will develop a conscience," with every sentence thinking for the robbers, doing the best it can to "gently persuade" them. But the robbers' "reason" has long been clouded by greed, and they can no longer be "restored." Then, "conscience" has no way to "grow," so what's left is just an empty "hope." Are their motives bad? It doesn't seem so. Like the village old woman "hoping that the true Son of Heaven will descend to earth," what it lacks is a realistic basis.

On the other hand, we also hear the cry of "hoping that the light will arrive early." This cry has become a common feeling among the Chinese people. After four years of experience, there is a realistic basis, but what is still lacking is subjective effort.

I am not an idealist, but we cannot ignore the role of the subjective. Letting "expectations" serve as a bridge to achieve "hope" is an idea below "waiting for the hare by the tree stump." It will only delay the "arrival" of "light." But there are many people hugging this "hope of light" and dozing off on the sofa. How can that not make people feel disheartened?

"Hope" has its future, but relying only on "hope" will also ruin this future.

### Autumn's Depression

— Ji Men

I am swirling in a small room of less than ten square feet. Suddenly, "creak..." The screen door opened, and a young man with slicked-back hair and a face powdered to an offensive whiteness peered inside and asked, "Is this the law offices of X?" But he himself seemed to realize that the question was superfluous, so without waiting for my answer, he walked in. Only then did I notice that he was also holding a modern woman by the arm.

The two visitors were indeed quite beautiful. The man was wearing a "XXX Tex" suit with a flashy bow tie. The woman had a 1941-style permed hairstyle, an autumn coat, and high-heeled shoes, exhibiting the twelve-part epitome of a fashionable Shanghai lady. They brought a gust of spring wind, almost completely evaporating the cold air of the office!

"Yes, may I ask your names and what brings you here!" I responded with practiced familiarity.

"My surname is Li! I wonder if Mr. X, the lawyer, is in?" The young male visitor, speaking in pure Shanghai dialect, answered half of my question. As he spoke, he kept looking around, revealing the "coarseness" and "impatience" that all floating young men possess.

"Yes, please come in," the office boy, Ah Xing, knew how to deal with this kind of visitor, so he interjected, beckoning with his hand and leading the two into the inner room—the lawyer's office.

I casually sat back down in my original seat, flipping open a copy of the Six Codes at random. But my ears were pricked, listening carefully to their conversation in the inner room.

Because the door to the inner room was not closed, almost every sentence could be heard clearly.

At first, it was the usual small talk. After everyone had lit a cigarette, the visitor who claimed to be surnamed Li immediately explained his reason for coming:

"Two years ago, following my parents' wishes and the words of a matchmaker, I married a country girl. We got along well enough, but she is too countrified, cannot read, and doesn't understand social etiquette... Now I've met this lady, and we are kindred spirits, so I want to get married. Mr. Lawyer, what needs to be done to make it legal?"

The visitor's statement was quite frank, which troubled our lawyer for a moment. But after all, he was a man who was used to handling this kind of thing. How could it stump him!

"This is easy. You should first complete the divorce procedures with your wife," the lawyer replied to the visitor after a moment of thought. He spoke with great certainty, indicating complete confidence in this kind of matter.

"But... my wife probably won't agree!" The visitor instead seemed weak.

"What does that matter? You can make up some facts! Something like 'improper conduct,' 'not settling down,' 'frequent arguments'! Of course, as you just said, 'too countrified, doesn't understand social etiquette' is not a valid reason..."

"But... she is also too pitiful..." The young man appeared even weaker, as if the lawyer was forcing him to divorce.

"Ha! This... you can give her some money and that will be fine!" the lawyer said with a smile.

"Yes... then that's how it will be done!" The lawyer's words gave him courage. He said this, also smiling in agreement.

"Ha... ha..." The female visitor also laughed.

"Bang!" The door to the inner room slammed shut, and the happy laughter was shut out.

Left in the outer room, I felt only the depression of autumn in my heart.

### A Way to Repent

— Ji Xian

Editor:

For the past few years, I have not been clear-headed and have drifted along with friends. Although I haven't lived a life of wild debauchery, I have spent ten or twenty yuan a day and ended up owing almost three thousand yuan. Borrowing and borrowing, I have never provided a single cent to my family. Fortunately, my family doesn't need my support. In order to clear my old debts, I have asked my family for money. My white-haired father and young wife are very forgiving, and I have thankfully paid off half of my old debts.

In the past few months, I have wanted to clear my head and become an ambitious young man. Moreover, I have a monthly income of nearly a hundred yuan, which can support myself. However, the pressure to repay my old debts is so intense that I can't sleep or eat, causing a still-healthy body to weaken. Recently, due to the pressure to repay my debts, I thought I should hide it from my father and wife and find a way to clear it myself. Because my elderly father and pregnant wife cannot withstand any unexpected grief or the recollection of the past deeds of an unworthy son. Moreover, it's a matter of money. Finally, I forced myself to smile, but the inner pain was destroying me, and I started thinking about the past again, and a small desire to be good was eroded.

But I am not discouraged. I continue to work hard. Unexpectedly, the news alarmed my white-haired father. Hearing his loving voice, how dare I reveal all of my past and add to the grief of an elderly person?

Finally, my elderly father saw his son sitting in a sea of sorrow every day and inevitably thought that his son was being tricked again. I have wanted to explain myself, because everything in the past has made them think that the words of their son and husband should be greatly discounted. I regret not having mentioned my previously repaid debts because it planted the seed of disbelief in my words.

Several times, I have returned home very late because I was trying to borrow money from friends to repay some of my old debts. They suspected that I had gone to a brothel, gambling house, or dance hall. But the poor son, even if I wanted to go, where would I get the money? Moreover, that is not what happened. Not only now, but even in my wild days I never went to those places. Returning home late, I dared not say I was borrowing money, so I lied and said I was at a friend's house, thus planting the seed of a second lie.

These past few days, my father has also lost weight, and my wife looks pale and tired. I want to comfort them, knowing that they are worried about me. My own affairs are the ones that are most cruelly destroying my heart. Editor, please give me a way to repent. A Ji

Mr. A Ji:

A prodigal son who can return is always a cause for celebration. It is also a sign that a great man can pull himself up. Under the attack of debt and suspicion, the anxiety and pain are unavoidable. We are not fatalists, so we will not say that this is your retribution. We say that these are the flowers that have blossomed and the fruits that have been borne from the seeds of your past debauchery.

Who is pressuring you for your debts? Who caused your family's distrust? These are all achievements that you have created yourself. To repay your debts, restore your credibility, and revive your reputation, you can only do it yourself with a firm resolve.

Facts are the best answer to your family. Presenting facts is the only way to repent. We hope you will work hard. The Editor

Mu Zhai said, "He is a minor official. If he wants to protect the locality, he can only be flexible. It is not like me, a man of renown, who must die." Liu Rushi coldly sneered and said, "My lord, you are saying this incorrectly. Of course, the court officials are responsible for governing the country. In the moment of national downfall, they should die to preserve their loyalty. But dying for the country is not limited to ministers, nor does it depend on whether one is famous or not. In ancient times, there were many peddlers and laborers who died unyielding for the country, while many high officials turned to the rebels. Although the county magistrate is small, he is also the little overlord of his county. Why don't you tell him that he is responsible for defending his territory?" Mu Zhai remained silent. Liu Rushi saw that Mu Zhai's expression was a bit weak and dispirited. She thought to herself that the easiest thing in ancient and modern times is to die, and the most difficult thing is also to die. It all depends on the state of one's mind. When a person reaches an emergency, they disregard death and grit their teeth to die, and that is the end of it. If one hesitates and retreats, then they lack the courage, and they cannot die in the end, and they will have to change their mind. Fortunately, the three-day deadline has passed, and tomorrow morning I will urge him to die quickly so that he will not finally lose his reputation and disgrace himself. With this thought, Liu Rushi no longer nagged Mu Zhai. At this time, news of the Qing army's capture of Nanjing, the Hongguang Emperor's death in Wuhu, and the general Huang Degong's death in battle came one after another. The county of Yushan became a place of great fear and panic. Because people feared that the Qing army would soon arrive. The Yangzhou massacre was frightening to the general population. Some gentlemen believed that the Ming dynasty was over, that Heaven's will was with the Qing, and that everyone should surrender to the new dynasty to become obedient subjects. They all came to Red Bean Villa to inquire about Qian Muzhai's attitude. Seeing that Qian Muzhai had not made a move, they made various guesses. That night, Mu Zhai still drank with Liu Rushi in his chambers, looking around and speaking little, no longer singing sad songs as he had done in the previous two days. The next morning, Liu Rushi got up early to urge Mu Zhai to get out of bed. Mu Zhai lazily put on his clothes and got up. After washing, it was already close to 9:00 AM. Liu Rushi also put on her finery, preparing to commit suicide with Mu Zhai by drinking poison. Mu Zhai said to Rushi, "Drinking poison causes a terrible death, it is better to hang ourselves." Rushi said, "Since you want to hang yourself, my lord, I will follow you." So she went to prepare two white silk cloths and placed them on the table. At this time, Liu Rushi was also very sad, but she forced herself to hold back her tears, not letting them flow from her eyes. Her heart felt as if it were being pierced by a thousand knives. Because she feared that if she cried, she would only cause Mu Zhai to lose his courage and be unable to die. Mu Zhai also put on his court robes and hat and sat in a chair, staring blankly at the white silk cloth on the table, his face pale. (21)

### John Barrymore Talks About Women

— Siwa

As far as I know, the most seductive woman is my grandmother, Mrs. John Drew, but if you ask me to break down the word "seduction," I would be at a loss for words. It is best if no one breaks it down, that is how it seems attractive. In fact, I don't have any slight understanding of the connotation of the word "seduction." I just feel that discovering it would be a tragedy of life. Here's a great analogy: it's like a rare stamp. A collector might spend his whole life searching for it, and its price might be an astonishing number, but once he really gets it, his interest will be over. Below is a list of the most seductive women I know. I express my gratitude to each one, because they have added flavor and interest to my work and entertainment.

Grandma Drew: She would marry three times, this is an extraordinary thing in her life, but this can explain my certain prejudices. She knew how to deal with men. She never ridiculed my young love affairs. She knew too much about this. When I was bewitched by an unconventional woman, she would invite her to the house to participate in a formal banquet, making this woman at a loss.

Carole Lombard: She has many aspects that I cannot describe. In short, she is full of seductiveness. I co-starred with her in "In the 30th Century," which was in 1934. I have many passionate performances like when I recently played "The Great Profile". It is not surprising that she was able to join with the great Clark Gable.

Sister Ethel: I am always in awe of her majesty. I fear her more than anyone. I remember the first time I worked with her, when I showed up in "Camille", I didn't read the lines well. My embarrassing face really disgusted her. Later, when I officially performed with her, I was still so afraid of her, I encouraged myself with strong liquor, but I still forgot my lines.

Virginia Weidler: She is only thirteen years old and is a successful child star. The first time I saw her, she was only eight years old. When we came down from the stage, she said to me, "Don't do that, you will interrupt my lines!" This made a socially savvy married man know how he should hang out with her. She also brought up my grandmother.

Katharine Hayes: She was my first wife. We met at Mrs. Astor's extravagant dance in New York. This is also one of her seductive factors. She, like my other wives, is very humorous. We were lavishly married in the church, which caused a sensation in the social world at that time.

Michael Strange: My second wife, when I met her, she had only published a collection of poems. I couldn't understand what she wrote, but maybe she bewitched me with them. She and my ex-wife were born on the same day in New Bruton, and were delivered into the world by the same doctor. (To be continued)

### The Drama Society Leases the Lafayette

— Qiuyu

Wonderful Program Planned for February - Ying Yin Confirmed to Participate in Acting

The Shanghai Drama Society, which has been performing at the Lafayette for more than a year, will have its contract expire with the Lafayette in half a month. This year's continuous performances have earned the Drama Society greater trust from the audience, and the society itself has laid a more solid foundation. Originally, when the contract was about to expire, two theaters had negotiated with the Drama Society, but because the theaters were not suitable for performing spoken dramas, it did not become a reality. Now, the Drama Society has decided to lease the Lafayette in February and start this February plan with all its strength. The Drama Society also leased the Lafayette Theater this summer. Although they only performed one show, because everyone worked hard, they earned six or seven thousand yuan. As far as we know, the Drama Society will put the most exciting programs on stage in these two months, such as "Rouge Butterfly Blood" by Yu Ling and Wu Chen Tai, "Home" adapted by Wu Tian based on Ba Jin's original work, "Sorrowful City" by Xia Yan, and "Metamorphosis" by Cao Yu. In short, around the New Year's Day, the Drama Society has arranged the most ideal programs. At the same time, in terms of talent, they are also doing their best to find people. For example, Ying Yin's participation in the Drama Society's performance was also confirmed by the authorities at the society's Christmas banquet yesterday, and Ying Yin also participated in this grand event. The Drama Society's new direction in 1941 is worthy of attention.
