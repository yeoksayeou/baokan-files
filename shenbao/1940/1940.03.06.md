Editorial

### No Doubt About British Policy Towards China

"Then, is British policy towards China 1,800 miles away from the National Government of China?" "No!" This was the exchange between Labour MP Davison and Foreign Office official Butler in the British House of Commons yesterday. In response to current doubts, they used exquisite language to seek accurate explanations, ultimately obtaining a solemn declaration. The words were simple, the meaning clear, and filled with passion and integrity. Those near and far who hear it will surely be drawn to it. Chongqing is 1,800 miles away from Shanghai. The National Government of China is in Chongqing. Although British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr has recently stayed in Chongqing, the embassy is in Shanghai. For the past thirty months, the international impression of Shanghai has been the general public's perception of Shanghai. They feel it is complicated and filled with murky atmosphere; they feel it is a source of conspiracy and a den of all evils; it is not only beyond the control of the National Government's decrees and authority, but what it expresses and brews often runs counter to the interests of the Chinese nation-state government. It is certainly not the capital of the country where envoys should reside, nor is it a place where envoys should linger. If policy towards China is based on Shanghai, then it is indeed 1,800 miles away from the National Government! Now, Davison raised his concerns, and Butler refuted them.

Since China resolutely resisted Japan and launched military operations, the various forms of support that Britain has provided to China are difficult to quantify in terms of their great value. This is not only understood by both Chinese and British officials and the public, but also resented by Japan and recognized by the world. However, the tariff concessions and compromises made earlier, the tolerance and concessions in the Tokyo negotiations later, and the frequent rumors of the loss of silver in Tianjin all showed signs of weakness in every dispute. This contradicted the actual support for China and violated the treaty rights in China. The stated policy was one thing, but the actions were weak. This has repeatedly caused unease and resentment among the Chinese and British public. Moreover, at a time when Japan wants to stop but cannot, and is pursuing both diplomatic and political offensives, it uses smoke to cover up its attempts to sow discord and division, and uses propaganda to spread its confusing and misleading tactics. Therefore, it tries every possible way to show people that Shanghai is not only beyond the National Government's remote control from Chongqing, but is also completely under Japanese control and stands as a base point in opposition to Chongqing, causing British Members of Parliament to have concerns about the British government's policy towards China, like Davison. Is this a success of the Japanese in terms of tactics? Or a failure of the British authorities in terms of sincerity?

We do not hesitate to say that there is a vast difference between our past and present views of the British government. To put it bluntly: in the past, we not only worried and doubted, but were also indignant, believing that if China failed to resist Japan, at the very least, Britain's interests in the East would be sacrificed, not only because of the situation, but also because of a willingness to promote it. Since it went to war with Germany and up to now, our views of Britain not only no longer worry and doubt, but also sympathize. This is not because we hate Germany more, but because we sympathize with the difficulties Britain faces in dealing with the environment, and we sympathize with the British authorities' credit and glory in fulfilling their international treaty obligations. We sympathize with the various arguments promoted by key British officials regarding the war. However, its difficulties may indeed increase its possibility of colluding with or even succumbing to violence in the Far East; especially if Britain finds itself at a disadvantage in the European war, or even strives to preserve its position in Europe and has to abandon its interests and withdraw from the Far East. Then this possibility will become more active and concrete. However, precisely because of the European war, we absolutely cannot imagine that the British authorities would disregard driving their people, disregarding gambling their national destiny, using gold and blood to maintain their credibility and glory in the balance of power in Europe and in national history, while in the Far East, without having to bet gold and blood, they would carelessly sacrifice it to a moment of cowardice and weakness. We absolutely cannot imagine that the arguments promoted by the British about resisting aggression, maintaining order, and loving democracy, freedom, justice, would be disproved by their perfunctory compromises in the Far East as false and deceptive rhetoric. We also absolutely cannot imagine that wartime Britain, by selling out China in the Pacific, would go against the United States, increasing the responsibilities and threats faced by the United States in the Pacific, and still be able to obtain full support from the United States in the Atlantic as they ideally wanted. Therefore, although the European war has had some unfavorable impact on China's resistance, we earnestly hope that Britain, France, Germany, and the Soviet Union will resolve their disputes as soon as possible and return to good relations. However, all the past concerns about British policy towards China have now completely disappeared. In short, if China does not continue to resist Japan, then Britain's policy towards China during China's resistance will naturally be abandoned, as exemplified by Britain's attitude towards the Abyssinian problem. If Britain abandons its stated policy towards China while China continues to resist Japan, the fact will be a withdrawal from the Far East, and the meaning will be a defeat without fighting against Japan. This impact will weaken foreign aid and strengthen the enemy's gains from foreign aid. Looking at Germany's attempt to court the Soviet Union and Japan, persuading Japan to end its invasion of China, the key is clear. As a diplomatic official, Butler answered Davison's concerns with a resounding "No!" His words were sonorous and resonant, and there was a reason for it.

### Cai Yuanpei Passed Away in Hong Kong; Chairman Chiang Sent a Condolence Telegram to Cai's Family; Corpse Moved to Funeral Home, Minor Encoffining Tomorrow

Hong Kong: Cai Yuanpei, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, felt slightly unwell on the morning of the 5th and was sent to the Sanatorium & Hospital for treatment. He passed away at 9:45 AM, at the age of 74. Wu Tiecheng, a member of the committee, is presiding over Cai's funeral. (5th Dispatch)

Chongqing: Chairman Chiang recently sent a condolence telegram to the family of Mr. Cai Jiemin, which read: "To Madam Cai and Brother Wuji in Hong Kong, it is with great shock that I learned of Mr. Jiemin's passing. The passing of an elder statesman is deeply mourned. I hope you will restrain your grief and carry on his legacy to comfort his spirit. I send this telegram of condolences, Chiang Kai-shek." 微, (5th Dispatch)

Always Thinking of National Affairs

A reporter from the Chongqing Central News Agency heard that Mr. Cai Jiemin, President of the Academia Sinica, passed away at his residence in Hong Kong on the morning of the 5th and immediately visited Qian Hong, Director-General of the Academia Sinica, to inquire about the details. Qian Hong made the following statement: Mr. Cai's health had not recovered since his illness in 1938. However, he still presided over or participated in the affairs of the Academia Sinica and major national affairs, never complaining of fatigue. After the "July 7th Incident," the southeastern provinces successively fell, and the Academia Sinica moved inland along with the government agencies. Mr. Cai wanted to continue the relocation when he was in Hong Kong in 1937, but due to his weakened condition after his illness, he was unable to endure the long journey and hardships, and he temporarily stayed in Hong Kong for recuperation at the doctor's and family's advice. Last March, the Council of the Academia Sinica held a meeting in Kunming, and Mr. Cai originally planned to attend despite his illness, but was temporarily stopped by the doctor. Although Mr. Cai was unable to go to the mainland in person, he was still very concerned about the affairs of the Academia Sinica and gave remote instructions whenever there were important matters. In the past, the various institutes of the Academia Sinica in Nanjing and Shanghai made great contributions and achieved remarkable results. After the War of Resistance, the various institutes were able to resume work in a short period of time despite being displaced and relocated. This was all due to the leadership and spiritual inspiration of Mr. Cai. As for the cause of his illness, although it was said that he was old and weak, his usual concern for national affairs and his indignation towards the Japanese army were the greatest reasons. A few months ago, he published the "Manjianghong 抗戰歌 (Resistance Song)," and his patriotism was evident in his words. However, the old man's body became increasingly weak as a result. In the summer of the year before last, he fainted once in the bathroom, but fortunately, the rescue was handled properly, and he did not suffer a major setback. It is said that this time, he fell after getting out of bed early in the morning three days ago, vomited blood, and lost consciousness. Although many Western doctors were called to give him injections and treatment, they could not save him. He passed away at 9:45 AM on the morning of the 5th. Mr. Cai has contributed to the Party and the country, especially in presiding over Peking University and the Academia Sinica. He has made great contributions to our country's education and scholarship. According to the organizational law of the Academia Sinica, the successor to the President of the Academia Sinica should be elected by the Council at a meeting, and three candidates should be presented to the National Government for selection and appointment. The current Council was originally scheduled to meet in Chongqing on March 22, and we hope that a successor will be appointed as soon as possible to avoid any disruption to the affairs of the Academia Sinica.

Dedicated to Education Throughout His Life

Chongqing: Cai Yuanpei, courtesy name Heqing, sobriquet Jiemin, was born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang. He was a former Qing Dynasty scholar. He served as the supervisor of the Shaoxing Chinese-Western School and a teacher at Nanyang Public School. He founded the Patriotic Girls' School, the Chinese Education Association, and the Patriotic Society, and joined the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance). He studied in Germany. Five years before the founding of the Republic of China, he lived in Berlin for a year. He then studied philosophy, literature, the history of civilization, anthropology, experimental psychology, and aesthetics at the University of Leipzig for three years. After the Xinhai Revolution, he returned to China and served as the Minister of Education of the Nanjing Provisional Government. During his tenure as Minister of Education, he established a Department of Social Education in addition to the Departments of General Education and Vocational Education. He resigned in the summer of the first year of the Republic of China and returned to the University of Leipzig to teach and conduct research at the World History of Civilization Institute for two years. He returned to China in the summer of that year and went to Europe again in the autumn, living in Paris for a year. When the European war began, he moved to southwestern France and helped Li Shizeng and others run the Franco-Chinese Education Association and organize the Hua Fa Education Association. In 1916, he returned to China and served as the President of Peking University, taking office in January of the following year. He reformed the school administration, revised the curriculum, and hired accomplished scholars to serve as professors. The academic atmosphere changed greatly, and Peking University became a source of new ideas. In 1919, the May Fourth Movement occurred. More than ten students from Peking University were arrested. Cai was angry at the government's inadequate handling of the students and left Beijing on May 9. After being persuaded to stay, he returned to school in September. In October of the ninth year, he went to France to plan the University of Lyon. He returned to China in the autumn of the following year. He resigned in January of the twelfth year and traveled to France. He recommended Jiang Menglin as his successor as president. In 1926, he was elected as a member of the Second Central Supervisory Committee and has been re-elected ever since. He also served as the Chancellor of the University Council and a member of the National Government Committee. He has been the President of the Academia Sinica since 1929. (5th Dispatch)

Wu Wang and Others Form Funeral Committee

Hong Kong: The body of Mr. Cai Jiemin was moved to the Fulu Shou Funeral Home on the afternoon of the 5th. After his eldest son, Wuji, arrives in Hong Kong, the minor encoffining is scheduled for 3:00 PM on the 7th. According to Wang Yunwu, Cai's illness was caused by a fall at his Kowloon residence on the morning of the 3rd, which resulted in a mouthful of blood, followed by blood in his stool. He was immediately treated by a doctor, and due to his advanced age, he was sent to the Sanatorium & Hospital. His condition was still good on the way. After being admitted to the hospital, he was injected with hemostatic agents and glucose, and his spirits improved slightly. At 9:00 PM on the 4th, his condition worsened. Five Chinese and Western doctors were consulted, and it was determined that he had a gastric hemorrhage. An emergency blood transfusion was performed, which had a remarkable effect. It was originally scheduled to continue the blood transfusion on the 5th, but his condition changed again at 8:00 AM on the 5th. Despite emergency treatment, he passed away at 9:45 AM. Madam Cai, Zhou Jun, his daughter, Ruian, and his sons, Huaixin and Yingduo, were all by his side. The youngest is only eleven years old. His second son, Berlin, is currently in France. Mr. Cai was 74 years old. He dedicated his life to revolution and educational and academic careers. His morality and writing were admired by the world. His sudden death shocked and grieved all who heard of it. Cai's friends Wu Tiecheng, Wang Yunwu, Ye Gongchao, and others formed a funeral committee to preside over the funeral. (5th Dispatch)

### Xinjiang Officials Hope China Can Defeat Japan; British Leftist Leader Publishes Impressions of Western China

Chongqing: British leftist leader Sir Stafford Cripps recently had interesting talks with leaders of the Chinese government in Chongqing and with leaders of the Soviet Union in Moscow. He has just returned from far western China after flying to Xinjiang and is now flying to Hong Kong today, en route to Shanghai. He used the Sino-Soviet Aviation Business between England and China, starting from Chongqing and flying directly to Moscow via Xinjiang. In fact, Sir Stafford and his secretary are the first ones to do that. When Sir Stafford and his group returned to Chongqing, they were unable to fly, so they traveled by car across northern Xinjiang along the important highway connecting China and the Soviet Union, a journey of nearly a thousand miles. Sir Stafford stayed in Moscow for thirty-six hours, meeting with several Soviet government officials, "aiming to obtain a more detailed explanation of the Soviet Union's policies on international events," but Sir Stafford stressed that his trip was entirely private in nature. According to him, rumors that the Soviet Union occupied or managed Xinjiang were inaccurate. He saw no evidence of Soviet occupation or management in any place he visited. He did not visit the ailing provincial chairman in Xinjiang, but he did have talks with senior officials of the province. Although Xinjiang maintains extremely friendly relations with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union provides a great deal of technical assistance to the development of Xinjiang, the provincial chairman and officials firmly maintain that the province is part of China and very much hope that China will win the war against Japan. The past disputes between Muslims and Chinese have been resolved. The authorities grant complete civil and religious equality to all ethnic groups, just like the White Russians, who now have the same rights as Chinese citizens. Xinjiang is currently engaged in its first three-year plan to develop light industry, education, and transportation. (Reuters, 5th Dispatch)

Rotterdam – It is expected that more Italian coal ships will set sail today, continuing to transport German coal to Italy, in order to avoid the British blockade. Six coal ships set sail from here yesterday. (Reuters, 5th)

London "The Times" diplomatic correspondent, discussing the Central Powers' decision to prevent German coal from being shipped to Italy by sea, and Italy's protests against this, stated that Britain's attitude is that all decisions are in accordance with international law. The British government's principles underlying all its actions, and its established plan for achieving victory, cannot be altered by foreign protests. The British government, to the best of its ability, seeks to alleviate the inconvenience and annoyance felt by neutral and non-belligerent countries, and treats everyone equally, seeking to make distinctions. When neutral countries have voiced grievances, the British government has always handled such issues with fairness and compassion, and made small adjustments from time to time. Italy's attitude is neither unjust nor unfriendly, but preventing German coal from being exported is not intended to make things difficult for Italy, but only to strike at Germany. When the British government decided to prevent the export of German products last September, it notified the Italian government, stating that Britain would sooner or later prevent Italy from purchasing and transporting German coal. The British government was well aware that a sudden ban would affect Italian industry, so it gave three months' notice. At the same time, the trade negotiations between the two countries, which had begun last year, were strengthened in order to allow British coal to be transported to Italy in exchange for certain Italian heavy industrial products. These negotiations stalled three or four weeks ago on this point. The British government had hoped to remove the difficulties, but seeing no movement from the Italian side, the order to prevent the export of German coal, which had long been anticipated, came into effect.

Amsterdam – According to news received here, the British wartime economy formally declared that the British blockade of German coal shipments to Italy has not been delayed. Rumors that the British government had allowed ships to load German coal to Italy are not consistent with the facts. "Ships that departed from port to load German coal before midnight on March 3 will be intercepted in accordance with the announced order." According to shipping industry sources, fourteen Italian ships currently anchored in Rotterdam have received orders to sail, six of which are fully loaded with German coal and sailed yesterday. The attitude of the British side towards them, and future developments, are of great concern here. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)

Amsterdam – The Italian coal ships, after leaving Rotterdam on the 2nd of this month, were once recalled by the shipowners. Today, the Italian railway bureau in Rotterdam received a telegram from Rome, ordering the coal ships to resume their voyage yesterday. People here believe that the British and Italian sides have not yet reached an agreement on the coal transportation issue. Italy's order for the coal ships to sail as usual is probably a test of Britain's attitude. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)

A correspondent from the "Swedish Daily News" in Berlin reports that the German government is now eagerly awaiting news of how Britain will deal with the Italian ships carrying German coal from Rotterdam back to Italy yesterday, as they pass through the British blockade zone. Berlin views the Italian ships' sailing out in defiance of the Central Powers' ban as a test of Britain's attitude. If the British navy does not detain these ships, it will be tantamount to acknowledging the illegitimacy of the blockade. Berlin sees the Italian government's decision to do this as proof that Italy is prepared to accept the consequences of this action. However, Berlin political circles do not believe that a serious conflict will occur if Britain intercepts the Italian ships, but they believe that the Italian ships' courageous venture across the British blockade zone is sufficient to indicate that Italy has decided to join the German side as its final plan. Berlin still remembers that when the League of Nations imposed sanctions on Italy over the Abyssinian issue, Italy used German coal instead of British coal. Now that the transport of German coal to France has ended, Germany, if it has enough trains available for railway transportation, believes that it can supply Italy's needs with a large amount of coal. (Reuters, 5th)

Rome – Regarding Britain's decision to detain German coal shipments destined for Italy, Italy's protest to Britain has recently been published by various newspapers, all with headlines such as "Italy's Wording is Clear and Firm," but without commentary. Foreign observers here say that Italy's protest is not limited to Britain's detention of German coal, but also protests against the principle of blockade and inspection. It is noteworthy that Italy's protest letter stated that the inspection methods contradict international law, but it did not mention the reason why Britain adopted the inspection methods, namely Germany's violation of international law. In other words, Germany's method of warfare is the cause, and Britain's measures are the effect. Italy only speaks of the effect without mentioning the cause, which is not fair. In addition, Italy strongly states that Britain's inspection methods have harmed non-belligerent countries, but the damage caused by German mines, submarines, and aircraft to the shipping of neutral countries is even greater, and Italy ignores it. In short, the British and French sides may be able to find a way to make Italy's required amount of coal certain, but not make them cancel the inspection. Whether Italy's protest is due to its reputation or to reaffirm German-Italian cooperation is unknown, but it is safe to say that Germany will be pleased with it. (Havas, 4th)

### Blockade Policy to Extend to the Far East, Japan Feels Uneasy

Paris – Regarding the blockade policy implemented by Britain and France, in addition to the Italian government's protest to Britain, according to news from Tokyo, Japan also feels uneasy about the possibility of this inspection method being extended outside the port of Vladivostok. It is reported that when the Japanese and French governments held talks on the Japanese aircraft bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, this issue was involved. However, those in charge here all say that the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is the only railway line for trade between European and American countries and China. Since the Japanese government disregards everything and demands that it be cut off, we will also make the same request for the Siberian Railway, because Germany can transport soybeans and other goods from that route. However, this request is completely contrary to current international law, so Britain and France have absolutely no intention of taking this step. As for blockading goods destined for Germany via the port of Vladivostok at sea, there is nothing to criticize. In fact, Britain and France have not yet taken any action in this regard, but Japan has already felt uneasy. Therefore, all parties concerned should also study this issue. (Havas, 4th)

### British and French Experts Arrive in Washington to Discuss Blockade-Related Issues

New York – British Ministry of Economic Warfare official Gotkin and French Blockade Department economic advisor Lister arrived here last night and are proceeding to Washington. Their mission is to explain the implementation of the Allied blockade to various U.S. departments. (Reuters, 5th)

### British Chancellor Announces Issuance of War Bonds, Limited to £300 Million, Subscription to Begin on the 12th of This Month

London – Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon announced in the House of Commons this afternoon that the new war bonds are limited to £300 million, with a term of 15 to 19 years and an interest rate of 3%, received at face value. Subscription will begin on the 12th of this month and close the next day. The Chancellor said that the country's huge expenditures are now supported by the increased taxes introduced last September, the increased issuance of treasury bills, and the increasing revenue from the savings campaign since last November. The government's delay in announcing the appeal to the public to subscribe to a large amount of bonds was because it had to wait for the market to be able to issue bonds. Now the time is ripe. Since the outbreak of the war, all borrowing has been short-term, but the new bonds will have a term of 15 to 19 years. The government is adhering to the policy of borrowing at the lowest possible interest rate, so the interest rate on the new bonds is set at 3%, but it is also appropriate from the investor's point of view. The bonds are scheduled to be repaid on October 15, 1959, but the Treasury reserves the right to repay all or part of them at any time after October 14, 1955, with three months' notice. Therefore, the bonds are intended to be named "3% War Bonds of 1955-59," limited to £300 million. The amount of money the government needs to borrow in the coming year will be much greater than this, but limiting the amount of the first issuance is beneficial to the Treasury from several perspectives, and is in line with those who lend. All subscribers must pay one-tenth at the time of subscription, and the remainder on April 15. Those who subscribe who do not reside in the United Kingdom are exempt from the bond tax, similar to the situation of subscribing to several war bonds during the last war. Post offices and national savings banks will all issue them on behalf of the government. All those who subscribe at these two locations must subscribe for at least £10 and no more than £1,000. This is to give subscribers the opportunity to use their savings to purchase new war bonds with a longer term than savings bonds and national defense bonds. (Reuters, 5th)

### British War Cabinet Rumored to be Reorganized

London – According to political sources here today, the British cabinet may be reorganized during the Easter recess of the House of Commons. At that time, Minister of Defence Coordination Chatfield, Minister of Supply Burgin, Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Dorman-Smith, and Minister of Food Morrison may be forced to leave their posts. At that time, the number of members of the British cabinet may be smaller, and all efforts will be focused on prolonging the war. (United Press, 5th)

### Britain Determined to Maintain Overseas Trade and Commercial Status in China, Consultations in Chongqing at Any Time

London – A spokesman for the Overseas Trade Department said here today that although Britain is at war, it is determined to maintain trade with overseas countries to the fullest extent possible. In the short period after the outbreak of the war, various countries will inevitably experience uncertainty and hesitation, but as far as Britain is concerned, this stage has definitely passed. Its manufacturers and traders are ready to meet the needs of overseas customers at any time. The government is also well aware that the maintenance of export trade is of great importance to the smooth progress of the war, so it has repeatedly declared that it is willing to promote it within its power. Although the government has to adopt a licensing system for certain exports to strengthen control, most ordinary exports are still unaffected. Even for exports that require a license, all the initial delays in issuing licenses have now been completely reformed. Although war inevitably causes difficulties and instability from time to time, Britain's traditional advantage at sea will continue to protect all kinds of goods entering and leaving its ports. We are quite confident about the prospect of maintaining the exchange of goods with various countries during the war, just as in peacetime. As for certain goods being included in the prohibited list, it does not mean that they are prohibited from being exported from Britain, but that they cannot be exported without a license. The spokesman concluded that if difficulties arise in obtaining goods from the Central Powers, British commercial, diplomatic, and consular officials stationed overseas are ready to investigate and, if necessary, report to the Department of Trade for a solution. (Reuters, 5th)

London – At a meeting of the House of Commons last night, a member asked whether the British government had taken sufficient steps to safeguard Britain's trading position in China after the end of the war. Under-Secretary Butler replied that the British Ambassador spends a lot of time in Chongqing, and that there is a permanent office of the Embassy there. When the British Ambassador is in Shanghai or elsewhere, he will contact the Chinese government on all matters relating to British trade interests. Although the British Embassy is 1,800 miles away from the Chinese government, when the British Ambassador is not in Chongqing, there are other fully qualified personnel to conduct consultations with the Chinese government. (Reuters, 5th)

### Burmese Oil Company Did Not Sell Oil to China, But Sold a Certain Supply

London – Lloyd, a commissioner of the Department of Trade stationed in Parliament, replied to a question in the House of Commons today that the Burmese Oil Company did not sell oil to China and does not intend to do so. The Burmese Oil Company, on behalf of other companies that do not produce oil in India and Burma, sold a certain supply to China. (Reuters, 5th)

### US Senator Advocates Ceding British Islands to Offset War Debts

Washington – Democratic Senator Leno and Democratic Congressman Randolph jointly introduced a draft resolution today, calling for US President Roosevelt to negotiate with Britain for the cession of British islands in the Western Hemisphere as a price for Britain paying off its huge war debts. The islands listed in the draft resolution to be ceded to the United States are: Bermuda, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Caicos, the Cayman Islands, Trinidad, Tobago, Barbados, Leeward, Antigua, St. Kitts, Nevis, Dominica, Montserrat, Le, and Tet. Windward, Grenada, the Grenadines, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent, British Honduras, etc. (United Press, 5th)

### British Troops Concentrated in Abyssinia's Neighboring Territories, Statement Claims It is a Wartime Precautionary Measure, Unrelated to the Dispute Over German Coal Shipments to Italy, British and French Forces in the Near East Number Less Than 100,000

London – British sources announced that since the dispute over German coal shipments to Italy occurred, British troops in Africa have been concentrated in the Kenyan colony, which borders Abyssinia. However, the British government has solemnly declared that the concentration of British troops in Africa is a normal wartime step and is unrelated to the dispute over German coal shipments to Italy. (United Press, 5th)

Rome – Local newspapers quoted a correspondent from Beirut as reporting that General Weygand, the commander-in-chief of the Anglo-French Allied Forces in the Near East, can directly deploy less than 100,000 troops, of which 50,000 were in Syria and Lebanon at the beginning of the war (September 3 last year). Since then, Britain and France have sent approximately 30,000 more Caucasian and black troops to Syria. In addition, there are 8,000 volunteers in Syria and 3,000 volunteers in Lebanon, as well as cavalry organized by Kurds and Serbs. There are a total of four army generals and one air force general in the area. The air force base is in Leja'a. Although the army is large, all equipment is lacking. Beirut especially feels that there are too many troops, making it difficult to supply them. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)

### Welles Collects European Situation Information, Brief Stay in Lausanne, Visit to France Tomorrow or the Day After

Lausanne – US Undersecretary of State Welles arrived here from Berlin at 3:50 pm yesterday. He plans to rest here for two days before taking a train to Paris to continue investigating the European war situation and the possibility of peace. Welles will stay in Paris for three days and in London for three days. After visiting London, he will come to Paris again and stay for one day before going to Rome. He will return home by ship from there on March 18. (United Press, 5th)

Lausanne – Welles arrived here yesterday and went to a hotel to rest after getting off the train. Welles is currently scheduled to leave for Paris tomorrow. It is said that Welles will draft a report on the situation in Berlin in the hotel and send it to President Roosevelt. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)

New York – Newspapers across the United States all believe that the rumors that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop made extreme demands during his secret talks with the US Assistant Secretary of State are true, and expressed regret over the extreme and aggressive nature of the German demands. (Reuters, 5th)

Washington – Regarding Undersecretary of State Welles's visit to Europe, people here have recently commented that the true value of this trip depends on how President Roosevelt uses it after Welles returns home and submits a detailed report to the President. Diplomatic circles, because they do not know the details of Welles's talks with the German authorities, believe that it is not possible to judge whether he has gained anything, but they believe that he has obtained various conveniences to inquire about the intentions of the German authorities and the "official goals" of the country's war. It is expected that when Welles goes to London and Paris, the British and French authorities will also give him the same convenience, so that he can submit a very detailed report to President Roosevelt. However, observers say that, based on the information currently available, it can be seen that the goals of the belligerent parties are completely different and there is no room for reconciliation. Therefore, President Roosevelt may not be able to do anything. (Havas, 5th)

Moscow – Regarding the British political plan to organize a "United States of Europe," the Russian Labor Newspaper "Trud" commented, stating that this is a consistent trick of Britain and France. Britain's war aim is to have others sacrifice their blood for a "United States of Europe" and restore Germany to its state 150 years ago, in other words, to fall into a state of disintegration. As the newspaper said, in order to completely eliminate the danger of France being threatened by Germany, Germany must be reduced to the status of a second-rate power. It can be seen that the so-called "United States of Europe" plan is nothing more than a means for Britain and France to achieve the goal of splitting Germany. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)

### German-Soviet Border Demarcation Completed, New Border is 1,500 Kilometers Long, 2,800 Watchtowers Established

Moscow – The Central Committee of the Soviet-German Border Demarcation Committee recently issued the following communiqué: "The work of establishing boundary markers along the 1,500-kilometer Soviet-German border was completed on February 27, 1940. A total of 2,820 boundary markers were established. The topographical survey of the new border has also been largely completed." (Tass, 5th)

Moscow – After the collapse of Poland, the German-Soviet demarcation of the new border has now ended. The border is 1,500 kilometers long, with 2,820 border watchtowers. The German-Soviet Mixed Central Committee is currently drafting the final document on the border agreement. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)

### Large Number of Poles Forced to Assist in Farming in Germany

Berlin – A government spokesman declared today that since the beginning of the war, approximately 140,000 Polish agricultural workers have come to Germany to work, and 100,000 more will continue to come here. The spokesman strongly stated that they came to Germany purely voluntarily, and said that in addition, there are 300,000 Polish prisoners of war who will also be sent to work in the fields. (Reuters, 5th)

### After the Fall of Viipuri, Soviet Offensive Is Contained; Atmosphere of Mediation Intensifies Again; Finland Firmly Rejects Humiliating Peace.

Stockholm. Foreign diplomatic circles here are closely watching the possibility of peace talks to end the war against Finland after the Soviet forces entered Viipuri, and the speculation about the Finnish political situation. It is generally believed that Finland's domestic political situation is at least as important as the war situation. Judging from the current situation, not only do the Germans want to see peace in Finland again, but so do the people of the Scandinavian Peninsula. However, it is believed that Finnish General Mannerheim and the army leaders will absolutely reject any proposals for peace on terms they consider unsatisfactory. (Reuters, 5th)

Bern. The "Ticino Post" correspondent in Stockholm cabled that in recent days, rumors about mediating the Soviet-Finnish war have been rampant. The governments of the Scandinavian Peninsula are very active diplomatically. It is said that relevant parties have proposed peace proposals to both the Finnish and Soviet governments. The main principle is that the Soviet Union recognizes Finland's independent sovereignty and the legitimate government led by Tanner, while forcing the "puppet government" led by Kuusinen to merge into the Helsinki government. Then the Finnish government would cede some territory to the Soviet Union as a military base. Diplomatic sources have not yet been able to confirm whether this is true. (Havas, 5th)

Helsinki. Finnish rear-guard troops are still blocking the Soviet advance towards Viipuri, while the main Finnish forces are defending the new defensive line behind Viipuri. People in Helsinki are somewhat less worried about the status of Viipuri and the general situation, as it is reported that Soviet troops have retreated from Notsee, and Finnish troops have won victories in places such as Koivisto, and the heavy snow in March has also begun to fall. (Reuters, 5th)

Stockholm. According to sources in Helsinki, after occupying the southern part of Viipuri, the Red Army has taken advantage of the victory to enter the city and engage in fierce street fighting with the Finnish army. The Finnish army is still defending the northern part of the city, resisting stubbornly. There are no changes in the war situation in other areas of the Karelian Isthmus. (Havas, 5th)

Helsinki. Finnish troops are patrolling around the port of Viipuri and have laid mines and anti-tank defenses in various nearby locations to stop the Red Army's advance. (Havas, 4th)

Moscow. According to a communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, yesterday Soviet troops occupied the islands of Uuras, Toppila and the fortress in the Karelian Isthmus and Viipuri Bay area, the islands of Tytärsaari, as well as the towns of Hiekkalahti, Virolahti, and Muhulahti on the west coast of Viipuri Bay. In the Toppila fortress area, Soviet troops captured three long-range naval guns and many firearms such as machine guns and rifles. There were no significant developments in other areas. The Soviet air force bombed enemy troops and enemy military targets. Enemy aircraft did not dare to engage. (TASS, 5th)

Helsinki. The General Headquarters has just released a battle report stating: (1) In the Karelian Isthmus, the Red Army's attempt to advance across the ice in Viipuri Bay yesterday was repelled by our army. Later, attacks in Viipuri Harbor, Vuoksi Lake, and northeast of Lake Ladoga were also unsuccessful. Artillery units on both sides were quite active in the eastern part of the Karelian Isthmus. (2) Artillery units on both sides bombarded each other in the Taipale River area west of Lake Ladoga, especially fiercely near the Kollaa River. The Red Army lost 1,200 soldiers. (3) In the Kuhmo area, our army's counterattack was quite successful, capturing a Red Army position. (4) Our aircraft bombed Red Army troop concentration points in the Karelian Isthmus yesterday. Soviet aircraft also concentrated on bombing northeast of Lake Ladoga, causing the most damage in Vyartsilya, Yänisjärvi, and Mäkiselkä. Enemy aircraft also flew into our inland to bomb, and strafed with machine guns in Kymijoki River valley, Kotka, Hamina, Kouvola, etc. A total of four enemy aircraft were shot down by our side yesterday. (Havas, 5th)

### Swedish Volunteers Fight Against Overwhelming Odds

Stockholm. According to sources in Helsinki, yesterday Swedish volunteers encountered Soviet troops with four times their strength while performing reconnaissance patrols on the Finnish front. After a fierce battle, the Soviet troops retreated with 200 casualties. The Swedish volunteers suffered minor casualties. (Reuters, 5th)

### 3,000 US Citizens Join Finnish Army Service

New York. According to Captain Stenberg, president of the Finnish Military Association here, more than 3,000 US citizens of Finnish descent will go to Finland in the near future to join the Finnish army and work as electricians, aircraft mechanics, and radio operators. The first batch of 1,000 people will leave within days. (Haitong, 5th)

### Finland Battered by Snow and Wind; Refugee Misery; Children Dying of Disease; Relief Work in Progress

Helsinki. The temperature here was below freezing last night. Dr. and Mrs. Repo, who investigated the situation of disaster victims in the Uusimaa province, have submitted a report revealing the miserable situation of children evacuated from the Far East war zone, stating that the evacuated children had to travel far distances in snowmobiles in windy and snowy weather. Most were bareheaded without hats and barefoot without socks. Those suffering from smallpox, bronchitis, or pneumonia accounted for 46%, and the number of deaths reached 755, accounting for 11%. The Harvard Committee today launched a plan to immediately send six ambulance teams with medicines to provide relief to children and issued an urgent appeal for funds. (Reuters, 5th)

### Romanian-Bulgarian Border Guards Clash; Both Sides Form Joint Committee to Investigate Incident

Bucharest. Border guards from Bulgaria and Romania clashed yesterday, resulting in the deaths of two Bulgarian guards and injuries to two Romanian guards. Many soldiers from both sides participated in the shooting. The Bulgarian and Romanian governments have formed a joint committee to investigate the incident. (United Press, 5th)

### Germany's Warfare Methods Angers the Netherlands; Dutch Merchant Ships Repeatedly Attacked by German Aircraft; Condemned as Violation of Neutral Country's Navigation Rights

The Hague. Responsible officials announced today that the Dutch government will take all necessary steps to protect Dutch ships from air strikes as soon as it receives accurate details of the recent bombing of Dutch ships in the North Sea. The government has not yet received an official report on this accident. (Reuters, 5th)

Amsterdam. The increasing number of attacks on Dutch ships by German aircraft has caused alarm in the Netherlands. It is generally believed that Germany's methods of dealing with neutral country ships have now entered a new and more serious stage. According to Dutch shipping sources, Germany clearly regards the simple fact of sailing at sea as a crime that should be attacked. Last Sunday, German Naval Commander-in-Chief Raeder broadcast a warning, saying that unless Britain abandons its current methods, neutral country ships in the war zone will not receive real protection. Today, newspapers here are filled with news of yesterday's attack on Dutch ships, and there are detailed reports of the tragedy of the sinking of the Dutch small coastal ship "Aelzina" by a bomb, with the captain and engineer killed. The "Rotterdam Daily," which often reflects the views of the Dutch government, exceptionally published an editorial this morning detailing Germany's new strategy, saying that Germany's war methods violate the rights of neutral country shipping and have caused the deepest resentment. As for the nationality of the aircraft attacking neutral country merchant ships, there is no doubt, as the German war bulletin has repeatedly mentioned the activities of the German air force in the North Sea in the past week, while Britain has never been heard to attack neutral country ships. It is expected that the Dutch government will accurately determine the nationality of the attacking aircraft as soon as possible, and then file a serious protest with the responsible parties and demand a satisfactory reply. The people of the country are determined to support the government. (Reuters, 5th)

Amsterdam. The 695-ton Dutch ship "Linteloom," which sailed from Downs to Amsterdam yesterday, has not arrived here by the deadline and is believed to have sunk. One of the ship's lifeboats, a life ring, and some cargo have reportedly been found floating on the surface of the sea. It is hoped that the twelve crew members have escaped on the ship's other small boats. It is reported that among the five crew members of the Dutch coastal ship "Aelzina," which was previously sunk by a German aircraft, three have escaped on rafts. After drifting at sea for 36 hours, they finally landed at a port on the northeast coast of England. One of them was injured. The ship's captain and engineer were killed by the blast. The "Aelzina" had a large Dutch flag painted on its hull to indicate its nationality. (Reuters, 5th)

### Britain's Largest Oil Tanker Sunk by Mine

Amsterdam. According to reports from London last night, Britain's largest oil tanker, the "Charles Medhurst," was sunk by a German submarine yesterday off the coast of Hastings. The ship saw the German submarine and tried to escape, but was hit by a torpedo from the German submarine and immediately exploded and sank. The sailors were rescued by lifeboats. The ship was the best-equipped oil tanker in the British oil tanker fleet and had traveled to and from China several times. (Haitong, 5th)

Amsterdam. Confirmed reports from London say that a large ship, weighing 6,700 tons, was attacked and sunk off the west coast of England. The ship's name is unknown. British military aircraft directed four lifeboats to rescue 53 crew members. (Haitong, 5th)

### German Submarine Sunk by British Aircraft

London. The British Air Force announced that a British Air Force aircraft attacked a German submarine at the mouth of the Elbe River in Germany yesterday afternoon and is believed to have destroyed it. When the British aircraft was engaged in reconnaissance, it saw a submarine in the shallow water and dropped bombs. One of the bombs hit the submarine between the conning tower and the stern. The submarine was then seen shrouded in thick, gray-black smoke, with only the upper part of the conning tower still above the water. (Reuters, 5th)

### Ship Sinking Statistics for the Past Week

London. According to an official announcement, in the week from January 25 to February 2, a total of three British and French ships, totaling 7,277 tons, were sunk by the enemy. Five neutral country ships were sunk, totaling 13,954 tons, for a total of 21,231 tons, which is less than half the average weekly loss since the start of the war. Of these five neutral country ships, two belonged to Italy, the "Maria" and the "Mirella," one belonged to Sweden, the "Laholm," one belonged to Norway, the "Vanstenfoss," and one belonged to the Netherlands, the "Aelzina." (Havas, 5th)

### British and French Naval and Air Force Achievements in Six Months of Operations; Have Coping Methods for Submarine and Mine Warfare; German Aircraft Losses Three to One Compared to British and French

London. A Havas reporter recently visited several British naval bases and interviewed British naval officials to discuss the naval war situation in the past six months. It was learned that in the first two weeks after the outbreak of the European war, German submarines sank a total of 130,985 tons of British and French merchant ships. Subsequently, Britain and France implemented escort measures, and the number of merchant ships sunk was greatly reduced. The tonnage sunk in November was only one-third of that in September. At the same time, German submarines were repeatedly sunk by British and French warships or aircraft, and the number of losses has exceeded one-quarter of the total tonnage. When Germany decided on the European war, it adopted unlimited submarine warfare methods, inflicting heavy blows on Britain and France. A total of 2,561,000 tons of British and French merchant ships were sunk in ten months in 1918. At present, in the first five months of the war, German submarines and mines have sunk less than 500,000 tons of British and French merchant ships, which is vastly different. The United Kingdom implemented a merchant ship escort system in 1918 and stepped up the construction of merchant ships so that those sunk by German submarines each month could be replenished. The British government is still implementing this method. On the other hand, the German Naval Department had 16 stopover stations along the coasts of Africa and the Americas during the last European war, but they no longer exist, so the German merchant fleet had to stop sailing overseas. As for the strength of the British Navy, in addition to the loss of the aircraft carrier "Courageous" and the battleship "Royal Oak," it has 11 battleships with displacements between 29,000 tons and 33,000 tons, 50 cruisers, 160 destroyers, 200 mine sweepers, and many auxiliary ships. As for the German Navy, the pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" has already been sunk by itself, and the "Blücher" and many submarines have been lost. Only five battleships with a tonnage of between 14,000 tons and 26,000 tons remain. There are also two 40,000-ton battleships and five heavy cruisers under construction. The German Naval Department has adopted magnetic mines, sinking many British and French merchant ships, but Britain has coping methods for this new type of weapon and is improving them day by day. Since November of last year, the number of British and French merchant ships sunk by mines has been greatly reduced. Not only that, but the British coast from the Firth of Forth to the Shetland Islands has been laid with a mine net, as if building a maritime Maginot Line. (Havas, 5th)

London. According to the British Air Force authorities, in the past six months, 45 British aircraft have been shot down by the enemy, and Germany has lost 114 aircraft. Forty-three British Royal Air Force aircraft were lost when attacking German naval bases, ports, docks, and areas where mines were laid. The other two aircraft were shot down by the Germans while reconnaissance the Siegfried Line. The Germans lost 51 fighter planes. Forty-two German planes were destroyed by the British on the Western Front and Heligoland. Fifty-nine were shot down by the British when attacking the east coast of England. (United Press, 5th)

### Results of Invasion; Japan's Raw Materials Scarce; Large Exports to China Not a Good Phenomenon; Business and Industry Deeply Concerned and Demand Restrictions

Tokyo. The increasing exports of Japanese goods to the Asian continent are causing deep concern among the country's business and industry circles. Many members of parliament have also raised questions in parliament, saying that this kind of "economic and material loss" is very dangerous, and the government authorities urgently need to intervene. According to statistics released by the Ministry of Finance, Japan's trade surplus with the Asian continent was 397,000,000 yen in 1937, 617,000,000 yen in 1938, and 1,094,000,000 yen in 1939. Although this is due to the needs of the Japanese military operations and the establishment of industries in China and "Manchukuo," the Japanese business and industry circles still believe that it is necessary to impose restrictions. There are two reasons for this: (1) There is a severe shortage of raw materials in Japan at this time, and it is not convenient to have such a large output; (2) The proper way to reorganize the East Asian group should be to have Chinese wealth flow into Japan, not to let it become the opposite phenomenon. According to the "Oriental Economist" magazine, the way to save this situation is to take the necessary measures in the financial field to suppress the soaring prices in China and "Manchukuo." The sharp rise in prices on the Asian continent is the main reason why Japanese goods are flowing into China and "Manchukuo." This is not only due to the pursuit of profit, but also because the currencies in the vast areas of the continent are linked to the yen. The rise in prices in China and "Manchukuo" has become a spiral. The rise began not in Japan but on the continent. The Japanese authorities have taken strong measures to control prices domestically. Even if prices have not been stopped from rising, the upward trend has been slowed down. "Manchukuo" has also taken similar measures, but they have not been effective. The rise in prices in North and Central China has not been curbed in reality. Compared with 1939 and 1936, the percentage increase in wholesale prices is as follows:

Looking at the table above, although the situation in Japan and "Manchukuo" is quite optimistic, the difference between the "controlled economic zone" (Tokyo and Changchun) and the "uncontrolled economic zone" (Tianjin and Shanghai) is so great that goods will naturally flow out. In addition, if the Japanese authorities want to restrict the country's exports to the Asian continent, there is an important fact that must be taken into account, that is, China and "Manchukuo" are difficult to be self-sufficient, and they are becoming increasingly dependent on Japanese goods. In the case of "Manchukuo," the volume of trade with Japan increased greatly in 1939. Since the outbreak of the European war, "Manchukuo" has not been able to import goods from European countries in practice. Whether consumers or producers, all who need goods must obtain them from Japan. In 1938, Japanese goods imported into "Manchukuo" accounted for 77.9% of total imports, and in 1939, it increased to 84.4%. As for the goods transported from "Manchukuo" to Japan, they accounted for 57.5% of total exports in 1938, and increased to 62.5% last year. Furthermore, in the case of North and Central China, due to the Sino-Japanese War, various goods in inland China that were normally sold in Tianjin and Shanghai were all blocked. Therefore, the need for Japanese goods is also increasing day by day. North China's economic institutions, which had connections with Central China during peacetime, are now relying on Japan on a large scale. (Havas, 4th)

### Japanese Diet Member Saito to Be Expelled; Allegedly Planning to Run Again One Year After Being Removed

Tokyo. Japanese Rikken Minseito Diet member Takao Saito told Japanese journalists today that he will be expelled from the House of Representatives tomorrow. He plans to run again one year after being removed. This move has been approved by his constituents. Saito refused to resign voluntarily because the House of Representatives would not allow him to explain his criticism of Prince Fumimaro Konoe. The "Asahi Shimbun" claims that three Rikken Minseito leaders will resign at the same time as Saito because they bear part of the responsibility for Saito's "slip of the tongue." (United Press)

Tokyo. Takao Saito, a veteran member of the Rikken Minseito party who is currently convalescing in Atami, today phoned the chairman of the House of Representatives Disciplinary Committee, saying that he has decided not to resign from his position as a member of the Diet due to his "slip of the tongue" in the Diet on February 2. The Disciplinary Committee will reconvene tomorrow afternoon to make a final decision on Saito's case. According to the "Asahi Shimbun," the Disciplinary Committee will unanimously agree to expel Saito from the Diet. The House of Representatives will hold a plenary session on March 7, prohibiting spectators, to listen to the report of the chairman of the Disciplinary Committee, debate the issue, and pass a judgment. It is reported that after the meeting, Speaker of the House of Representatives Koyama will announce Saito's expulsion, but this move has not yet resolved the Saito incident, as a few political parties are organizing a movement to attack the attitude of the Rikken Minseito party and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. At the same time, Saito is now likely to become a hero admired by the public. (Reuters, 5th)

### Roosevelt's Seventh Anniversary as President; US Democratic Party Holds Grand Celebration

### America's Imminent Embargo Threatens Japan Severely: Desperate Search for Raw Materials Yields Dim Hope; U.S. Predicts No Policy Shift; Renowned American Journalist Steele's Observations from Shanghai after Leaving Japan

Steele, a Far East correspondent for the Chicago Daily News of the United States, recently arrived in Shanghai after spending six weeks in Japan. Yesterday, speaking to foreign journalists, he said that although the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty had been abolished, Japan's policies were unlikely to change. Japan, now facing the threat of an embargo due to the treaty's termination, like a dangerous sword hanging overhead, is making every effort to seek raw materials from other sources. However, whether these efforts will succeed remains highly doubtful.

Attempts to Develop New Markets: In order to compensate for the possible loss of its urgently needed imports, Japan is now planning to obtain these raw materials from other countries, has begun to increase domestic production, and consistently pursues its policy of developing new markets. It welcomes the dispatch of an economic mission from Argentina, hoping to obtain wool and other products in Argentina to meet its needs.

Hopes for Assistance from the Soviet Union: Japan also hopes to promote trade relations with the South Seas Islands. In this regard, Japan seeks to obtain iron supplies from Malaya and other countries to compensate for its loss of scrap iron from the United States. In addition, Japan is conducting trade negotiations with the Soviet Union, hoping that the Soviet Union will become another source of imports.

Increasingly Close Sino-Tibetan Relations: Before going to Japan, Steele visited the interior of China and spoke with the young child who is now the Fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet at the Kumbum Monastery in Qinghai (transliteration). According to Steele's account, the child had not yet been selected as the Dalai Lama at that time, but the monks told the reporter that the image seen in the sacred lake and other omens all indicated that the child had an excellent chance of being selected. He saw that the child was exceptionally intelligent and that his birthplace was within China's sphere of influence. This matter will certainly have significant implications for future political relations between China and Tibet.

### Coal Briquettes Sold at Cost: Industry Willing to Continue, but Requests Lower Transportation Costs

The Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, reporting on the cost-price sale of coal briquettes and requesting the Chamber to quickly negotiate a reduction in water transportation fees. It stated that the cost-price sale of coal briquettes had been successful. Except for the first day, when the Kunyuanxing Coal Shop at No. 21, due to the small number of poor people in the area, had 20 unsold out of the originally planned 40 loads of briquettes, all the briquettes were sold out every day for the next three days. However, it was noted that the planned amount of cost-price briquettes at No. 21 was originally 40 loads per day, but was reduced to 20 loads from the second day onwards. The remaining 20 loads were then reallocated to the Xieyuan Coal Shop at No. 274恺自邇 Road, which was responsible for selling them at cost price, and a 27th location was established. It was also noted that the Huachang Coal Shop at No. 7, originally scheduled to sell 40 loads of cost-price briquettes per day, found that the number of poor people in the area was insufficient, so Shanyi Taixing automatically increased the amount by 20 loads per day, for a total of 60 loads per day. However, all the factories belonging to our Association are very willing to continue to sell coal briquettes at cost price under the leadership of your Chamber in the future, even at a sacrifice. However, the soaring water transportation costs are related to the cost of production. We previously heard that Director Yu Qiaqing had agreed to find a way to reduce them, but to this day, there is no concrete news. It has been found that in recent days, due to the comparison between the cost of raw materials and the selling price, the factories have suffered huge losses, so some have already stopped production. We hope that your Chamber will relay our request to Director Yu Qiaqing to quickly find a way to reduce costs and speak on our behalf, so that we can escape business difficulties and ensure social stability.

Boiled Water Industry: The Shanghai Boiled Water Industry Association, in order to urgently seek a solution to the coal shortage, held a temporary general meeting of all members yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the Ningbo Native Place Association on Yu Qiaqing Road. More than 500 members attended, and Kui Yanfang also attended to provide guidance. The members pledged to donate more than 1,000 yuan on the spot. Then, the discussion began on (1) How to solve the coal shortage problem of the industry. It was resolved that all members should go to the Association to complete the procedures from now on and continue to prepare a document with prominent figures in Shanghai to negotiate with the Kai'ao Mining Bureau for cheap supplies. (2) Comply with the Association's articles of association and stipulate the price of selling water in order to unify it. It was resolved to unanimously abide by the Association's articles of association and change the price to one cent per ladle from now on. Those who exceed the price limit will be severely punished after investigation.

Public Utility Factory: According to a letter from the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association, the No. 2 factory of the Public Utility Coal Briquette Factory at No. 699 Changping Road has now received a letter from the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, ordering it to be closed on the 8th of this month. However, the factory is currently rushing to produce coal briquettes and producing as much as possible to supply the market and reduce panic. If it is closed, there will inevitably be a shortage of goods on the market, which is contrary to the policy of relieving the fuel panic. Therefore, we are writing to the Municipal Council to request that the closing date of the No. 2 factory be postponed for 60 days, so that when the new factory is completed, it can continue to produce briquettes, which will be beneficial to the industry's business and the supply and demand of fuel.

### Wang Jun Shot by Friend: Chest and Left Arm Each Hit by a Bullet, Sent to Guangci Hospital for Treatment by Police

Wang Jun, a 28-year-old man from Hubei, currently residing on Jessfield Road in Shanghai's West District, at around 6:30 PM yesterday, Wang was with three friends, passing the intersection of Ningbo Road and Dongzihuo Street in the French Concession, when one of them pulled out a gun and shot at Wang. He was hit by two bullets on the spot, one in the chest and one in the left arm, with blood flowing straight down. He fell to the ground in response. The three assailants fled in different directions. When the nearby police arrived, the assailants had already escaped far away. Later, he was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment by police car. It was learned afterwards that he had been bathing with the three men in a certain bathhouse there and was attacked in this way after going out.

### After the Sinking of the Jingsheng Ferry, It Was Struck Again by Turbulent Currents, Sunken Ship No Longer in Original Location, Still Not Salvaged, Over 200 Passengers Likely Drowned Inside Cabin

Following the tragic sinking of the Ningbo ferry Jingsheng at the Ningbo wharf, groups in Shanghai and Ningbo have actively been handling the aftermath. The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai has allocated 10,000 yuan for relief, which was remitted yesterday. Ten divers also took the Kaiming ferry yesterday afternoon to宁波. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency has continued to record the details as follows:

Donations Remitted: In order to assist the authorities in handling the aftermath, the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai convened a temporary joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees the day before yesterday afternoon. In addition to sending a telegram to Yu Jimin, the head of the Jingsheng Ferry disaster relief committee, that evening to express condolences to the families of the victims, 10,000 yuan was allocated from the disaster relief donation fund in Ningbo and remitted to Ningbo by telegram yesterday morning, so that the authorities could spend it as soon as possible to handle the aftermath.

Sunken Ship Missing: It was learned yesterday that the capsized Jingsheng Ferry was originally near the north bank of the Ningbo port, but the water flow there is turbulent. According to later investigations, the sunken ship is no longer in its original location and has generally drifted to the vicinity of the Sanjiangkou estuary, so it has not yet been salvaged. According to inquiries from the ticket sales department of the Moufu Ferry, 102 people had not boarded the ferry to Shanghai. These passengers were all in the upper cabin of the Jingsheng Ferry at the time and must have drowned inside the cabin, resulting in most of the bodies still missing.

Additional Divers Hired: The Ningbo Barge Transportation Company telegraphed Shanghai the day before yesterday to hire divers to go there to salvage the bodies. The shipping department of the Moufu Ferry hired three people on its behalf. It was learned yesterday that because Ningbo urgently needed to salvage the bodies, it hired seven more people, for a total of ten. The group departed from Shanghai at 12:00 noon yesterday aboard the Kaiming barge of the Fengyu Public Customs Brokerage, going directly to Ningbo.

### Lu Ying Visits Baugham: "Special Police Force" Unlikely to Be Established Due to Lack of Concrete Plans, Shanghai's West District Crimes Remain Unaddressed by Japanese Side

The Shanghai Times reported that "Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Chief" Lu Ying visited Major Baugham, chief of the Public Concession Police Force, at the Public Concession Police Headquarters yesterday (the 4th) afternoon, and held an initial informal discussion on the establishment of a special police force for extraterritorial roads. Accompanied by Ying on his return was his advisor, Colonel Igarashi, and Shi Maoru, deputy chief of the Police Force, and Akagi Chikashi, special deputy chief, also participated in this informal meeting. No concrete plans for the special police force were put forward by either side during the discussion, but it was decided that after the Police Force and "officials from the Municipal Police Bureau" studied certain documents, another meeting would be held next week. The special police force is the organization stipulated in the provisional agreement signed by the Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government" two weeks ago, and is the first step in resolving disputes over extraterritorial roads.

Closure of Gambling Dens Repeatedly Postponed: The Continental Daily reported yesterday (the 4th) that it was learned from official sources that the gambling dens in Shanghai's West District would not be cleared until the new "Special Police Force" jointly formed by the Municipal Council and the Shanghai Municipal Government" was established, but the date of the team's establishment has not yet been determined. It was reported at the beginning of the month that the "Shanghai Municipal Government" would close all the gambling dens in the West District in February, but this did not materialize. It was later reported that it had been postponed to March 10th. Yesterday, the police bureau claimed that "Although this move is sincere, it cannot be realized until there is a large police force to handle the situation."

If Not Cleared, They Will Become More Rampant: It is said that the Japanese army's profits from the crime venues in the West District amount to about 1.5 million yuan per month, so the Japanese army itself cannot clear the crime situation. The only way is to leave the management of the West District to impartial organs. On the other hand, the responsible new police force will not take on the policing work in the area until a policy is determined on how to handle the situation. Once the new police agency takes over the area, it must either thoroughly clear it or allow the crimes to continue to be rampant and collect a portion of the income from the crime venues.

All Plans Under Discussion: Major Baugham, chief of the Public Concession Police Force, will discuss the establishment plan of the new police force with "Municipal Police Bureau Chief" Lu Ying at length this week. It is said that the Police Force has drafted a plan for the new police district and the address of the police station, in order to tax the roads outside the boundary and its adjacent areas. Some of the police station addresses are those of the "Dadao Police Bureau" that has already been established. This plan will be accepted by the "Shanghai Municipal Government" and will be discussed during this period.

### Two Japanese Ships Collide: Small Boats Capsize, Thousands of Bags of Flour Fall into the Huangpu River, But No Boatmen Injured or Killed

The North-China Daily News reported that on Saturday afternoon, the Japanese freighter Xinbao Maru (transliteration), owned by the Renlian Steamship Company and weighing 2,000 tons, was docked in front of the Huangpu Wharf, unloading flour, green beans, cigarettes, and cottonseed oil from several small boats into the ship. When another Japanese freighter, Duxima Maru (transliteration), attempted to berth alongside the wharf in front of the Xinbao Maru, it got too close to the Xinbao Maru, causing three of the small boats between the two ships to be squeezed and capsized, and at least five others to be heavily damaged. Thousands of bags of flour and other items fell into the water, but most of them have been salvaged, and there were no deaths or injuries.

### British Military Attaché Visits Japanese Commander

The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that Colonel Baker-Carr, who succeeded Colonel Spear as the British Army Military Attaché in China, visited Lieutenant General Fujitian, commander-in-chief of the Japanese army stationed in Shanghai, at his headquarters in Jiangwan at 10:00 AM this morning (the 5th). Colonel Spear was arrested by the Japanese army in North China on May 26th of last year on suspicion of espionage, and was not released until September 8th. At that time, the Japanese side issued a statement stating that Colonel Shi "destroyed the Japanese military law, but the extent of his destruction was excusable," so he was released.

### Salvation Army Fundraising Temporarily Concludes, Over 45,000 Yuan Raised

Mr. Morris, the Shanghai District Commander of the Salvation Army, told people that the total amount of donations raised by the Army has reached 145,800 yuan, and it is now announcing a temporary conclusion, but it will still continue to accept donations for a short period of time in order to reach the total amount of 150,000 yuan.

### Furniture Workers' Union Holds Inaugural Meeting Yesterday

More than 7,000 furniture workers in this city organized the Shanghai Furniture Workers' Association. Furniture workers have joined the association one after another. Up to now, no less than 5,000 people have joined. Starting from January of this year, the association launched a request to the owners of each shop to increase wages by 30%. Taichang, Mao Quantai, etc., have agreed to increase the wages of all workers by 30% starting from January of this year. Labor and management have signed a contract and have already implemented the increase. The association held its inaugural meeting at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday.

### Public Bus Labor Strike Resolved, Conditions Satisfactory, Labor and Management Sincere with Each Other, Resulting in This Outcome, Workers Extremely Grateful for Support from All Sectors

All the workers of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company went on strike due to demands for improved treatment. The case was mediated by Mr. Yu Qiaqing, who invited both parties to negotiate. All the workers' demands were negotiated and resolved. All the workers expressed extreme satisfaction. The details are recorded below:

Conditions Satisfactory: All the workers of the public bus company put forward twelve demands to the company authorities in order to demand improved treatment. Mr. Yu Qiaqing, the Chinese director of the Municipal Council, together with the Industrial Section of the police force, convened a mediation meeting at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday. All the labor's demands were negotiated and resolved satisfactorily. The content is recorded below: (1) Living allowance, increase from the current 10% to 30%. (2) Rice allowance method, changed to allow each person to purchase half a picul of rice per month at a price of 15 yuan, regardless of the extent to which the rice price rises, all losses will be borne by the company. (3) Cancel the 1936 new worker application form. Starting from 1940, all workers will be given an annual bonus. (4) If a person is not at fault, the company will never arbitrarily dismiss him. (5) During the strike period, wages will be paid as usual, and negotiations will be held separately. (6) If a person dies or becomes disabled on duty, the company will issue pensions, bereavement payments, funeral expenses, etc. The company has already implemented this, and there is no problem. (7) Same as Article 3, no problem. (8) Workers injured in this strike, after being examined by a doctor sent by the company and confirmed to be true, all medical expenses and wages will be borne by the company. (9) Each worker's work shall not exceed eight hours, no problem. (10 & 11) Both items were automatically withdrawn by the labor side. (12) Workers in the mechanical department who have worked for six months will be considered for promotion to full-time workers. In addition, the coppersmith requested a free bus pass, and Mr. Yu was responsible for negotiating with the company. Therefore, the entire case was satisfactorily resolved.

Workers Gratified: The labor and management negotiated the conditions for five hours the day before yesterday before reaching a resolution. Mr. Yu Qiaqing drafted a letter to inform the workers, hoping that they would work with peace of mind. The letter was handed over to the labor representatives. At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the labor side convened a meeting of the cadres of each department, and the attending representatives reported on the negotiation and resolution process and read Mr. Yu Qiao's notification letter. All the workers expressed satisfaction with the resolution plan, especially expressing unusual gratitude for the efforts of Director Yu Qiaqing and the Concession authorities to mediate and provide well-intentioned advice. It was heard that in addition to accepting the resolution plan on the spot, it was also decided to publish a notice in the newspaper to thank Mr. Yu and all parties.

Gratitude Notice: The labor side issued a gratitude notice yesterday, stating that "This time, our colleagues requested that the company authorities improve treatment, resulting in a labor dispute. We are grateful to Director Yu Qiaqing for not sparing his efforts to be responsible for mediation, and to Mr. McKay of the Municipal Council Police Force, Liao Zhongqian, and Mr. Gu Bingyuan of the Industrial Section for their assistance, so that it could be resolved satisfactorily. Our colleagues are deeply grateful and thank all sectors for their concern, assistance, sympathy, and condolences. In addition to thanking them in person, we specially publish this notice in the newspaper to express our heartfelt thanks. We hope that you will take note."

Reported in Western Newspapers: The Continental Daily reported that "It was heard from reliable sources yesterday that the workers of the British-owned public bus company went on strike since last Thursday because the salaries of the foreign employees of the company had increased by 15%, and the senior Chinese personnel warned the company not to take this 'discriminatory measure', but the company ignored it. According to a representative of the workers, a senior company official said that he did not hear about the impending strike until the night of Wednesday, which is not true, because the workers had warned the company in advance. Since the salaries of foreign employees have been increased by 15%, it is not excessive for Chinese employees to demand an increase of 14%, because the salaries of Chinese workers are, on average, much lower than those of foreign employees. After the strike occurred, a certain party sent people to campaign and promised the workers that if they continued the strike, they would be subsidized by the party. However, before the strike, they were never instigated by anyone."

### Miscellaneous Grain Industry Establishes Import Group, Expands Foreign Rice Sources, Prevents Price Gouging, Stipulates That Goods Must Be Cleared Within Ten Days, Overdue Goods Will Be Reported by Seller as Hoarding

The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Industry Association, the fellow traders engaged in foreign rice, specially established an import group to promote contact among the fellow traders, to collude to expand the source of foreign rice, in order to help suppress market prices. The group stipulates that in order to prevent speculation and raising market prices in foreign rice trading, the buyer must clear the goods within ten days of the transaction at the latest. If there is a delay, the seller can report it as hoarding. After this proposal was published, it was like a head-on blow to those who speculate, so the trend of speculation has been slightly curbed. Recently, the market price of foreign rice has been falling back day by day, which has a considerable impact. Regarding the buyer's taking of rice samples when shipping the goods, the sample bag is enlarged as much as possible, and the capacity is also increased, but the rice bag is pierced into holes, and leaks often occur, which invisibly increases the cost. The group is trying to correct this and is now widely soliciting styles and mutually seeking improvement. Regarding expanding the source of supply, it is considered to be the fundamental key to regulating people's food and suppressing rice prices at present. The group has decided to gather the strength of the fellow traders to do its utmost. Therefore, foreign rice will continue to be shipped to Shanghai, so that the entire people's food supply will not be in danger of being deficient.

Large Quantities Arrive: Large quantities of foreign rice are arriving one after another. Yesterday, more than 45,000 bags arrived in Shanghai. It is intended that the Yilunlinsaniutuo (transliteration) ship transported 15,166 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, as well as 20,717 bags of corn (i.e. pearl rice). The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai the day before yesterday, but due to the influence of the weather, it only entered the port at about 11:00 AM yesterday and docked at the Hongkou Shuntai Wharf to unload. The corn was purchased by foreign firms such as Fujia, Heyi, and Dafu. Most of the foreign rice is handled by Jianyuan and others. The De Sheng ship of the Qiahe Foreign Company transported 2,026 bags from Hong Kong, and the Jinan ship of the Taikoo Company transported 2,724 bags from Haiphong, as well as 6,896 bags from Hong Kong, and the Suzhou ship transported 20,534 bags directly from Siam. All the ships arrived in Shanghai before noon yesterday and are already unloading.

Siamese Rice Arrives for the First Time: Previously, the foreign rice that arrived was all Saigon foreign indica rice from French Indochina. The Siamese rice transported by the Su Lun yesterday was the first time. The second round of the Zha Hua Mail Steamship Company's ship Savo Luo (transliteration), which is contracted to transport foreign rice, will transport about 40,000 bags from Yangon, and it is heard that it will be able to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 7th). After the Dapu ship of the Hualun Foreign Company has completed unloading the foreign rice, it is heard that it will go to Saigon to transport rice to Shanghai again.

### Gambling Dens in Nanshi Reopen

The gambling dens in Nanshi's fake bureaus all automatically suspended operations on the second because it was rumored that the French authorities and Father Jacquinot, the founder of the refugee area, opposed them, but from the third, the Heng'an Company at No. 24 Heng'anfang on the Nanyang Bridge, because the host, Li Xiaobao, the king of lotteries, had a strong background, was the first to resume business, and others such as the Xieli Company at No. 14 Wengjia Lane in the Old West Gate and the Xieji Company at No. 1 Anrenli, Qingyun Street, Nine Acres Land, have also reopened one after another. There is also the Dazhong Company at No. 163 Fuyou Road in the refugee area, which is scheduled to open on the 6th, and the Rong Sheng Company is also being renovated and prepared to open at No. 1 Zhao Fang Lane, Lao Ximenkou Xiangzheng Xing. At the same time, lottery gambling is everywhere, and the harm is particularly serious. The rumor that all the gambling dens in Nanshi have been closed and that the Nanshi fake police station strictly prohibits gambling is purely a lie.

### Situation in Eastern Zhejiang Stabilized, Traffic Resumes: Jinxi, Jin-Chang, Yong-Fang Lines All Resume Traffic Without Obstacles

Since the Japanese army secretly crossed the south bank of the Qiantang River, the situation in eastern Zhejiang tended to be tense. After our army blocked and attacked, the Japanese army was defeated and retreated one after another. Except for the county seat of Xiaoshan, and a small number of Japanese troops entrenched in Xilingjiangbian and the Wenjia Weir area of Kanshan, the Japanese troops who fled to other places have been repelled. Therefore, the battle situation on the south bank has stabilized, and the passenger cars from Jinhua to Xikou, Jinhua to Changle, and Yongkang to Fangyan, which had been temporarily suspended, have now resumed normal traffic.

### Over 70,000 Deaths in the Public Concession Last Year: Total Number is 72,857

According to the statistics on deaths in the Public Concession in 1939 released by the Health Department of the Public Concession Municipal Council, there were 72,857 deaths, of which 37,316 were abandoned corpses, 10,310 coffins were transported out of the Concession, 9,099 were collected by the Pushan Villa, and 16,112 were coffined. From this point of view, the number of deaths is so huge. If we combine the statistics from the French Concession and outside the Concession, the number would be even more alarming.

### Burma Permits Transit of Chinese Goods: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sends Telegrams to Various Places: Government and Commercial Goods Not Restricted by Export Ban, But Purchases Made in Burma Must Be Submitted for Approval Batch by Batch

After the war, cargo transportation takes Burma as a channel. The Burmese authorities previously promulgated an export ban, which attracted the attention of the business community. It is now known that this ban by the Burmese authorities does not apply to goods coming from other places to Burma, and then going to other places via Burma. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently sent telegrams to relevant agencies across the country to inform them. The original telegram said, "Regarding the Burmese export ban, the previous telegram has been received. According to the report of our Minister Zeng Juechang, our government's materials, going to China via Burma, are not restricted. We have received a letter from the Burmese Senate notifying us that the Supply Bureau has taken the necessary steps to fulfill the wishes of the Chinese government, etc. Recently, it was also announced that materials coming from other places to Burma, and then going to other places via Burma, are not subject to the export ban. It seems to include government and commercial goods. As for those purchased in Burma, they must be submitted for approval batch by batch. In addition to forwarding to relevant agencies, this telegram is sent for your information."

### City Chamber of Commerce Instructs on Methods for Foreign Goods Certification

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, after receiving a letter from the New Medicine Industry Association inquiring about whether certificates can be issued for non-domestic goods, immediately replied, "(1) If the goods shipped out contain non-domestic goods, another letter should be processed. The association will issue another general certificate in a simple format, proving that it is a product of a certain European country, sold in Shanghai by a certain foreign firm, with import tax, or a certain foreign firm's invoice. (2) If foreign goods are only changed from canned to bottled or canned, the economic evaluation agency cannot issue a domestic goods certificate according to law, and the association cannot issue a domestic goods certificate. (3) The method for foreign goods certification does not apply to the six-part application form."

I specially kept it for you and will return it now." Mr. Chen felt particularly impressed and admired that such an honest newspaper boy could exist in this chaotic world.

### Do Not Send Mail to England Via Siberia: British Embassy Issues Notice to British Nationals, Fearing Letters May Be Inspected by Germany

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury* reported that the British Embassy issued a notice this morning (5th) warning British nationals not to send mail to England via Siberia. The notice stated that it had recently been reported that letters from China to England had been opened by German inspectors. It was then discovered that these letters were sent to England via Siberia. Under the current circumstances, although these letters should not pass through German territory, there is a risk that they may transit through Germany. This is because once the letters leave Chinese territory, they are no longer under the control of the Chinese postal authorities. However, mail from China to Europe is often routed through Siberia. Therefore, the British Embassy hereby informs British nationals that letters to England that do not clearly specify a route may fall into the hands of German inspectors.

### Owner of Yongtai Chang Copper and Tin Shop Melts Copper Coins for Profit: Owner Flees, Two Shop Assistants Arrested

The Yongtai Chang copper and tin shop at No. 825 Beijing Road, owned by Wu Haitang from Shaoxing, has recently been melting old-style copper coins at the behest of Wu, who, seeing the soaring prices of everything and especially the price of copper, knew there was an opportunity. He only cared about making profit and disregarded national laws. He instructed the shop assistants to collect old copper coins and entrusted Yu Jinsheng and Xu Changlin, both from Shaoxing and residing at No. 8, Lane 140, Xinzha Road, to melt the coins and sell them at high prices. This matter was discovered by Yang Feihua, a Chinese detective of the Xinzha Police Station. Believing that such behavior clearly violated national laws, he, together with a Western detective, Lytton, went to Xinzha Road yesterday afternoon, arrested Yu and Xu, and confiscated a large bag of copper coins and thirteen melted copper bars. They then went to Yongtai Chang on Beijing Road to arrest the owner, but he had already fled upon hearing the news. Only two shop assistants, Li Guilin and Jiang Qingrong, were apprehended and taken to the police station for detention. They were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, described the case and requested a postponement. Judge Fu briefly interrogated the four defendants and ordered them to be detained for a rescheduled hearing this Saturday.

### Gangsters Steal Car: One Bandit Watches Driver; Car Returned After One Hour

A car from the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company, license number 1714, was being driven empty by its driver at 8:10 PM last night when it was passing near the intersection of Connaught Road and Jessfield Road. Suddenly, three gangsters jumped out from the roadside and stopped the car. One of them pointed a pistol at the driver and threatened him to get out of the car. The driver, intimidated by the force, had no choice but to obey. He was pushed into a dark alley nearby and watched by the armed gangster. The other two, seeing that the arrangement was complete, jumped into the car and drove away. Until about 9:10 PM, the two gangsters drove the original car back to the original location. They then ordered the armed gangster to stop watching the driver and told the driver to get back into the car and leave quickly. After obtaining the original car, the driver hurried back to the company and reported the incident to the police station for record. As for what the gangsters did with the car, it is currently under investigation.

### Extortion of Gold Shop Manager: Defendant Released on Bail, Handwriting Still to be Authenticated

Guo Yutang, a shareholder of the Laofengxiang Gold Shop on Nanjing Road, previously dissatisfied with various aspects of the manager, Fei Zushou, proposed a withdrawal of shares. However, after negotiations, a final settlement could not be reached as the figures differed by too much. Guo had threatened to file a lawsuit against Fei for embezzlement. Then, at the end of last year, Fei suddenly received two threatening letters purportedly from a special task force. He entrusted lawyers Jiang Baoli and Jiang Pingfan to report the matter to the Zhabei Police Station. After detailed investigation, it was believed that the threatening letters were written by Guo Xiukai, son of Guo Yutang. Hua detective Xue Youwen arrested Guo Xiukai and sent him to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiefei continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. Police lawyer Ru BaoYi presented to the court a report from Mei Yu, a handwriting expert from the Public Works Department, to prove that the threatening letters were indeed written by Guo Xiukai, which Guo firmly denied. His defense lawyer, Zou Yusheng, requested the court to appoint another expert for a re-examination to ensure impartiality. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Xiao ordered a postponement of the case pending the appointment of an expert to authenticate the handwriting. The defendant, Guo Xiukai, was granted bail of 3,000 yuan and allowed to leave under the custody of his defense lawyer, Zou Yu, who would later provide the official bail bond.

### Falling from Tram Leads to Death: Ticket Seller Sentenced to Imprisonment

Xu Yongyi, a 22-year-old man from Ningbo and resident of No. 55 Yunnan Road, a sack maker, was riding a No. 16 trolley bus from east to west on the evening of the 20th of last month at around 7 PM. As he wanted to get off at the intersection of Avenue Haig and Route de Sayzo, the ticket seller on the bus, Wu Xuegao from Jiangbei, did not ring the bell to stop the bus but suddenly opened the iron door, causing Xu Yongyi to fall from the bus and hit his head. The bus continued forward and quickly disappeared. Subsequently, Xu Zhengting, a Chinese detective from the Xinzha Police Station, found Xu, sent him to the hospital, but he died despite treatment. A tram ticket was found near the deceased, which led to an investigation with the tram company. It was learned that the ticket seller on the tram at the time was Wu Xuegao, who was arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for questioning. He confessed clearly. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao, in the Second Criminal Court, announced the verdict: Wu Xuegao was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for causing death through negligence in his work.

### Woman Obstructs Marriage: Man Sues for Termination of Engagement and Seeks 6,000 Yuan in Emotional Damages; Case Awaits File from the First Special District Court for Further Hearing

Li Shoujun, a local youth aged 30, residing at No. 2 Xinshun North Lane, Remi Road, Ladu Road, became engaged to Qian Kaoyi, a fellow townsman aged 28, residing at No. 28 Continental Terrace, Rue Lupan, on June 15th last year, through the introduction of Wu Jian'ge and Shen Jinsheng. The wedding was scheduled for October 23rd. However, just before the wedding date, the woman suddenly proposed

four conditions: (1) a gift of 1,000 yuan to the woman's family; (2) four pieces of gold jewelry for the woman; (3) a self-owned house; (4) a full set of rosewood furniture. Li, due to insufficient financial resources, could not accept. He asked the matchmakers to negotiate with the woman. She eventually agreed to reduce the gift money to 500 yuan. Li then proposed that the wedding take place on January 19th of this year and set the Dengtuomo Hotel as the wedding hall. However, when the time came, the woman

deliberately obstructed the wedding and refused to marry. Li then engaged lawyer Ni to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, seeking termination of the engagement and demanding 6,000 yuan in emotional damages and over 7,000 yuan in other gift money. However, the case was not under the jurisdiction of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Ni filed a lawsuit on behalf of Li in the Civil Court of the Second Special District, requesting a judgment to terminate the engagement contract signed on June 15, 1939, and order the return of the engagement gifts and damages totaling 691.80 yuan in national currency. Based on the complaint, Judge Li Liang of the Seventh Civil Court heard the case yesterday morning. The defendant appeared with lawyer Li Mo. After questioning in court, because the case required the retrieval of files from the First Special District Court, it was ordered that the case be heard again after a ruling.

### Social Miscellany

Pan Jinbao, a 38-year-old woman from Huzhou, residing in the pavilion room on the third floor of No. 245 Jiaxiyi Road, Dapuqiao, French Concession, and Kangmi Company, usually worked as a female worker at the nearby Yongkang Cotton Weaving Factory.

Her lower body was naked, and her upper body was only wearing a white shirt. Her chest and abdomen had six or seven knife wounds. The report was made to the French Concession Police, who sent a hearse to the morgue to examine the body. They reported to the court for an examination and are rigorously pursuing the murderer.

Wu Yin, a 28-year-old nun from Taiping Nunnery in Jiangyin, with a beautiful appearance, came to Shanghai from her hometown of Fenghua on the 28th of last month to solicit donations. After arriving in Shanghai, she was introduced by a relative named Zhou and stayed at the Yu Ke Inn at No. 681 Rue Massenet, opening room No. 6. Unexpectedly, at around 2 AM that night, a porter from Jiangyin named You Shangen, 26 years old, seeing that Wu Yin was alone and vulnerable in the still of the night, pried open the door and threatened her with harsh words before raping her. Afterwards, the nun felt unwilling to bear it and reported the matter to a relative the next day, who accompanied her to report to the French Concession Police. Upon receiving the report, the head of the police sent detectives to the address and arrested Yun Shangen and the owner of the inn, Pang Shiyi, and took them to the police station. It is scheduled that the case will be taken to court today for investigation and handling.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: We are writing in response to a statement by Mr. Kuile that appeared in the local news section of the first page of the Shen Bao on the 2nd of this month, regarding "Fake personnel intimidating and extorting money." This is not in accordance with the facts. On October 17th of last year, Mr. Kuile and his son-in-law, Ruan Wangxing, were at the Hongkou vegetable market demanding the repayment of membership fees and loans from Mr. and Mrs. He. Mr. and Mrs. He were unreasonable and abusive, leading to a dispute. At the time, there were many vendors in the vegetable market, who gathered to watch, resulting in interference from Japanese military police, who took Mr. Kuile and others to the consulate for questioning. After learning that the dispute was about money, they ordered Mr. and Mrs. He to repay the money in installments and released Mr. Kuile and others. The interference of the Japanese military police was not at the instigation of Mr. Kuile, nor was Mr. and Mrs. He handcuffed when they went to the Japanese consulate. There was also no illegal assault or extortion of money. Moreover, the unpaid portion of the loan has already been judged by the Shanghai First Special District Court to be repaid by Mr. and Mrs. He, which shows that Mr. and Mrs. He were entirely trying to evade the debt and therefore made a false accusation. As the case is already in court, the truth will be revealed and a legal solution will be obtained. As this is related to Mr. Kuile's reputation, we are writing to request a correction. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Zhang Zhiguo, March 5th.

Education News

### Loss of Middle School Graduation Certificate: Request for Proof of Graduation Qualification; Ministry of Education Recently Announced Four Measures

(Chongqing Airmail) The Ministry of Education recently announced four measures for students of secondary schools who have lost their graduation certificates and are requesting proof of graduation qualification. The original text is as follows:

(1) If the original school is still in existence, the original school should investigate the case and provide proof, which should be submitted to the competent educational administrative authority for approval.

(2) If the original school has closed down, a written certification from two former teachers or staff members of the original school or two appointed officials of the original competent educational administrative authority should be obtained and submitted to the competent educational administrative authority for approval. If it is not possible to obtain certification from the above-mentioned personnel, a written certification from two or more currently serving appointed civil servants may be submitted, along with the submission to the competent educational administrative authority for approval.

(3) If the competent educational administrative authority is truly isolated and it is temporarily impossible to submit for approval, if the original school is still in existence, the original school may issue a formal certificate of proof as a temporary measure, and the reason why it cannot be submitted for approval must be stated. If the original school has closed down, temporary proof may be provided by one or more teachers or staff members of the original school, appointed officials of the original competent educational administrative authority, or currently serving appointed civil servants. Once the competent educational administrative authority is reachable by mail, it should still be submitted for approval. If any fraud or forgery is discovered, in addition to the revocation of the graduation qualification, the certifier shall be liable under the law. (This item only applies during the war.)

(4) When students of secondary schools request proof of graduation qualification, they should comply with the following regulations: (A) The reason for the loss of the graduation certificate must be published in a prominent local newspaper for three days or more, declaring that the previous loss is void (the newspaper must be attached). (B) The certificate should state the applicant's name, gender, age, place of origin, name of the original graduating school, name of the former principal, and date of graduation, and must include two two-and-a-half-inch portrait photos of the applicant, one affixed to the certificate and one filed with the competent educational administrative authority. (Inside) The certifier should state the place of origin, age, gender, occupation, and address on the certificate, and sign and seal it.

### Current Status of Compulsory Education Implementation in Zhejiang Province (3)

(5) Compiling and Issuing Short and Small Textbooks: Counties in this province with inconvenient transportation find it difficult to purchase short and small textbooks, and the cost of books and transportation is a considerable burden. To address the issue of insufficient funds for schools and to alleviate their difficulties in purchasing books, measures for book publishers to send short and small textbooks to various counties and cities have been established. Book publishers will directly send the books to various county and city governments according to the number of textbooks prescribed, within five days of receiving the notification from the Department of Education. County and city mayors and principals only need to collect them when receiving funds, which is very convenient. Half of the funds for this item will be allocated from the central and provincial compulsory education funds, and the remaining half will be used as equipment funds to enrich the content. Since implementation, there have been no major obstacles.

(6) Experimenting with Diagnosis and Treatment of Diseases in Short-Term Schoolchildren: Due to financial constraints, short-term schools in various counties lack adequate facilities for health matters. Starting in the second to fifth year of the Republic, this province began cooperating with the Department of Civil Affairs and the Provincial Health Experimental Office to designate Lin'an, Yuhang, Fuyang, Xindeng, and Shihua counties to experiment with the diagnosis and treatment of heat rash, eye disease, and malaria in schoolchildren, and to promote smallpox vaccination. As a result, 6,400 schoolchildren were vaccinated against smallpox, with positive results. However, the diagnosis and treatment of heat rash and malaria was not implemented, which is regrettable.

Other matters stipulated in Article 5 of the National Compulsory Education Outline, such as (1) promoting graded primary schools, (2) enriching the number of students in existing grades, (3) rigorously implementing the system, (4) improving private schools, and (5) experimenting with itinerant education, have all had implementation measures drafted and ordered to be followed by various counties.

In short, compulsory education during the 24th and 25th years of the Republic was like a newborn infant, waiting to continue to grow. When the July 7th Incident occurred at Lugouqiao, and the Japanese invaders attacked, the capital was occupied, and the provincial capital fell, the three western Zhejiang prefectures became guerrilla areas. The counties in eastern Zhejiang were also affected by military matters and population movements, creating an anti-government situation. Educational facilities had to adapt to the needs of wartime. Therefore, compulsory education entered another stage. Since the War of Resistance, compulsory education has taken on a wartime function. From the full-scale War of Resistance that began in August of the 26th year, it will not be possible to conclude until the end of the war. It is difficult to separate them. Therefore, when discussing the current status of compulsory education implementation in this province, strictly speaking, it should be from the 26th year of the Republic onwards. The items already completed and those pending are listed as follows:

A. Post-War Compulsory Education Matters Already Completed

(1) Implementing Mobile Teaching: At the beginning of the War of Resistance, a significant number of school-age children from the counties in western Zhejiang that had become guerrilla areas retreated to the counties in eastern Zhejiang. The educational funds of the counties in eastern Zhejiang were mostly stretched, and even existing schools had experienced shutdowns. Therefore, many children of school age could not enroll and wandered around all day. If remedial measures were not taken quickly, there would be serious consequences. However, due to the military situation and scattered relocation, fixed education methods could not be used. Therefore, mobile education facilities were established. In the second semester of the 26th year, the Department of Education issued the "Outline for the Establishment of Mobile Schools" and allocated a portion of the funds from the central and provincial compulsory education funds. Forty provincial-run mobile schools were established in fifteen counties close to the war zone, such as Xiaoshan, as a pioneering effort. In the 27th year, the Department of Education re-issued the "Outline for the Implementation of Mobile Education in War Zones in Zhejiang Province." Regarding compulsory education, a total of twenty-nine mobile schools were established in the war zone counties.

### Gu Zhenggang Telegram to the Shanghai Education Association: Encouraging the Education Community in Shanghai

(Chongqing, 5th) Gu Zhenggang, Minister of the Department of Social Affairs of the Central Committee, sent a telegram to the Shanghai Education Association, which read: "To the Shanghai Education Association, forwarding to all members of the education community in Shanghai: Under great pressure, you are still able to lead your colleagues and fight against evil forces. From afar, I extend my deepest admiration and comfort. I hope you will continue to work hard, cultivate talents, and lay a foundation for the country's long-term plan, in accordance with your initial aspirations to serve the nation. Gu Zhenggang bows in respect."

### Some Schools Increase Teachers' Salaries; St. Mary's Has the Largest Increase, 50 Percent Increase, plus a Housing Allowance of 20 Yuan

Since the war, the cost of living in this city has been rising, and recently it has become even more alarming. In order to stabilize the livelihoods of teachers and staff, some schools at all levels in this city have slightly subsidized the cost of living for teachers and staff, starting this semester. The increases are generally between five and ten yuan, but St. Mary's Hall, the girls' middle school, has the highest increase, increasing teachers' salaries by 50 percent and also providing a housing allowance of 20 yuan.

### School News Roundup

During its memorial week yesterday, Shanghai Girls' Middle School invited Jiang Liquan, a judge from the Second Special District Court, to give a lecture at the school. After Principal Lin Kanghou led the ceremony of respect, he introduced Judge Jiang, who lectured on the topic of "The Status of Women in Law."

The Shanghai Short-Term Tutorial School is affiliated with the Shanghai Women's Tutorial School at No. 54 Hualong Road and No. 630 Route Cardinal Mercier, and is dedicated to helping adults who have dropped out of school and whose parents are busy with work. The fees are particularly low. To facilitate students' extracurricular studies, the school yesterday divided the class schedule into morning, evening, and night classes. The morning class is from 6:30 AM to 8:05 AM, the evening class is from 5:25 PM to 7:10 PM, and the night class is from 7:15 PM to 9:00 PM.

Mr. Jin Hewang, a literary giant from Wuzhong, is a great poet with a long-standing reputation in the Southeast. He has now come to Shanghai to serve as a professor of Chinese literature at Guanghua University. His students have requested that he teach poetry during his spare time, and he has agreed, limiting the number of students to twelve, both male and female. They are divided into two groups, A and B. Group A pays 5 yuan per month, and Group B pays 8 yuan. The course lasts for three months. The address is Guanghua Dormitory, 3rd Floor, Securities Building, Jiujiang Road. The brochure can be viewed in person.

### Finance: Sassoon Continues to Buy Vigorously, Exchange Rates for British and American Currencies Tighten Again

In the foreign exchange market yesterday, the HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged after the announcement. The unofficial market for British and American currencies initially showed a slight easing, but suddenly tightened again later in the day. As a result, both spot rates weakened. This was because Sassoon continued to buy aggressively, reportedly purchasing over 300,000 yuan worth of U.S. dollars. Furthermore, HSBC was actively buying throughout the day, so the market could not rise for long. In the early morning, the exchange rates for British and American currencies overseas contracted sharply by 1.625 points, causing the market to open with a tight U.S. dollar and flat British pound. The prices were 4 pence 1.5625 and 6.78125 yuan, respectively. Later, a certain Chinese bank and a group of speculators jointly sold, causing the market to suddenly rise to 4 pence 1.71875 and 6.8125 yuan. However, HSBC was interested in buying at the aforementioned selling price, and a Japanese yarn factory suddenly came to purchase, coupled with Sassoon's aggressive buying, causing the market to quickly tighten. The U.S. dollar immediately contracted to 6.75 yuan, while the British pound remained at 4 pence 1.5625. Later, the buyers stopped buying, and many speculators sold their positions, causing the U.S. dollar to ease again. However, HSBC suddenly resumed buying at noon, and it was rumored that a few speculators saw the situation and started buying again, causing the market to tighten again. By the close of the market, the rates had retreated to 4 pence 1.40625 and 6.71875 yuan. The afternoon market was quiet. Although a Japanese yarn factory came to purchase spot sterling again, foreign banks were willing to sell, so there was little impact. The tightest rate for the British pound was 4 pence 1.125. However, by the close of the market, the British pound was still at 4 pence 1.40625, and the U.S. dollar was at 6.71875 yuan. As a result, the rates tightened by 0.015625 and 0.09375 compared to the previous day. The potential for futures was no different from the spot market.

Chinese Merchants Initially Sold Jointly

In the early morning, due to the large orders from London, the near-term rate rose sharply by 1.0625 pence, and the far-term rate rose sharply by 875. The New York silver price remained flat. The British pound exchange rate against the U.S. dollar, Shanghai yuan, and French franc were all flat. The U.S. dollar fell 1.625 points against the British pound, 5 points against the Shanghai yuan, and 1.25 points against the French franc. The central bank's exchange rates remained unchanged. The opening selling prices of spot rates at banks in the morning were 4 pence 1.5625 for the British pound and 6.78125 yuan for the U.S. dollar, tighter by 0.03125 for the U.S. dollar compared to the previous close, due to the contraction of exchange rates. At the same time, the opening prices of futures also showed a flat British pound and a contraction of 0.03125 for the U.S. dollar. After the opening, a certain Chinese bank sold first, and then speculators followed suit, causing the market to harden slightly. The Chinese bank sold spot U.S. dollars to HSBC at 6.8125 yuan, and speculators sold U.S. dollar futures for the next month to a certain bank at 6.6875 yuan. At that time, spot sterling could be settled at 4 pence 1.71875. The HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged after the announcement. The silver balance tax rose by 6 points. After that, a Japanese yarn factory needed to purchase, and Sassoon also followed suit, buying a large amount of U.S. dollars, causing the market to suddenly tighten. The Japanese yarn factory settled spot sterling for this month at 4 pence 1.09375, and Sassoon settled a large amount of U.S. dollars, benefitting a certain bank, for this month at 6.6875 yuan. At that time, the spot U.S. dollar had weakened to 6.75 yuan, but the British pound had returned to 4 pence 1.5625. Later, the buying momentum gradually subsided, and the potential became flat. At 10:30, speculators came again to sell U.S. dollar futures for this month, causing the U.S. dollar to ease again. Unexpectedly, after 11:30, HSBC returned to buy spot sterling from a Chinese bank at 4 pence 1.40625 and purchased spot U.S. dollars from a fellow bank at 6.78125 yuan. Therefore, the process softened again. By the noon close, the British pound was still at 4 pence 1.40625, and the U.S. dollar was only at 6.71875 yuan, tighter by 0.015625 for the British pound and weaker by 0.0625 for the U.S. dollar compared to the morning opening. The tightness of the British and American futures exchange rates was also the same as the spot prices.

Japanese Factories Purchased Spot Sterling

The afternoon market was slightly calmer. Although a Japanese yarn factory came to purchase spot sterling again, the impact was small. Spot sterling was settled with a foreign bank at 4 pence 1.125. At the same time, a Dutch bank sold U.S. dollars for this month at 6.65625 yuan, and a certain bank sold U.S. dollars for the same month to speculators, also at 6.65625 yuan. Later, only Hong Kong banks sold sterling and bought U.S. dollars, with little change. By the close of the evening market, the British pound was at 4 pence 1.40625, the U.S. dollar was at 6.71875 yuan, the British pound for this month was at 4 pence 1.09375, and the U.S. dollar was at 6.65625 yuan. The British pound for next month was at 4 pence 0.0625, and the U.S. dollar was at 6.5625 yuan. As a result, the spot British pound tightened by 0.015625, and the U.S. dollar weakened by 0.09375 compared to the previous day.

### Hong Kong Banks Purchase Vigorously, Gold Prices Rise Again Yesterday, Ultimately Creating a Wavering Situation Due to Money Supply Issues

Yesterday's spot gold unofficial market entered a firm and rising phase again. This was because foreign exchange tightened and Hong Kong banks purchased strongly, ultimately rising by 57 yuan. It opened in the morning up 17 yuan, at 4,750 yuan. The reason was that foreign exchange tightened after loosening. Later, a certain securities firm sold short again, causing it to be pressed down to a low price of 4,735 yuan. Then, a Hong Kong bank suddenly entrusted a certain brokerage to buy, and money exchange firms also purchased, causing the potential to strengthen again, rising sharply by 40 yuan. However, a certain bank suddenly sold on behalf of long positions and fell back. Ultimately, Hong Kong banks resumed buying, and as foreign exchange was reported to be tight, and it was heard that HSBC was eating well, people's confidence was greatly boosted, and retail investors aggressively purchased, reaching as high as 4,806 yuan. At noon, money exchange firms took profits and sold, slightly pulling back. In the early afternoon, securities firms frequently sold, continuing to fall to 4,782 yuan. Then, a certain money exchange firm and a certain gold firm strongly competed to buy on behalf of two Hong Kong banks, and a certain securities firm also purchased, rising again to a high point of 4,810 yuan. Later, a certain securities firm sold aggressively, and as the foreign exchange market was reported to be stable, it immediately pulled back to 4,780 yuan. However, a certain gold firm bought again, so the closing price was still at 4,790 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was approximately 2,600-700 taels. The price of gold ornaments in silver shops rose by 5 yuan. The customs gold price remained flat.

Spot Gold Rises by 57 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (10 taels), the foreign exchange market initially loosened and then softened, and the situation was still good. It opened up by 17 yuan. First, a certain silver shop and gold firm bought 50 taels, for 4,750 yuan. Later, a certain securities firm sold short again, causing it to be pressed down by 15 yuan. The securities firm sold 30 taels to a certain gold firm, for 4,735 yuan. After that, a certain gold firm continued to buy aggressively on behalf of Hong Kong banks, and money exchange firms also followed suit. Although certain silver shops sold on behalf of long positions, the inventory was still insufficient, rising by 40 yuan. A certain silver shop and a silver shop bought 20 taels each from money exchange firms, both for 4,775 yuan. Then, Hong Kong banks stopped activities, and the buying momentum gradually subsided. The securities firms also sold, falling by 19 yuan. Silver shops mutually traded 30 taels, for 4,756 yuan. Ultimately, as Hong Kong banks came to buy again, prices became firm and rose again. Soon after, as foreign exchange was reported to be soft, morale rose, and retail investors aggressively purchased, jumping out of the 4,800 yuan barrier. A gold firm bought 20 taels from a silver shop, for 4,806 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange firm took profits and sold, pulling back by 16 yuan. The money exchange firm sold 50 taels to a gold firm, for 4,790 yuan, as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, a certain silver shop first sold 20 taels to a gold firm, still for 4,800 yuan. Shortly after, silver shops frequently sold, falling by 18 yuan. Silver shops mutually traded 30 taels, for 4,782 yuan. Then, certain money exchange firms competed to buy aggressively, and a certain securities firm and gold firm (on behalf of Hong Kong banks) also mutually purchased, with a strong buying momentum, rising sharply by 28 yuan. The gold firm sold 10 taels to a certain silver shop, for 4,810 yuan. Later, a certain securities firm suddenly sold aggressively, and a certain silver shop also sold, falling back by 30 yuan. The securities firm sold 50 taels to a silver shop, for 4,780 yuan. Near the close, a certain gold firm bought again, rising by 10 yuan. A securities firm sold 10 taels to a gold firm, for 4,790 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, it rose by 57 yuan compared to the previous day, with a total fluctuation of 75 yuan for the day. The selling price of spot gold was higher by several yuan than the spot price, and the purchase price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold was over 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.

Gold Ornaments Listed Up by 5 Yuan Yesterday

The exchange price of gold ornaments in silver shops was initially 480 yuan at the big banks. At noon at 12:00, it was listed up by 5 yuan. As a result, the big banks changed to 485 yuan. The new banks had the same price as the previous one. The purchase price was reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Securities: Foreign Stocks Plunge, Domestic Bonds Stable

Yesterday's securities unofficial market was relatively firm, and the trend was extremely sluggish, with most people taking a wait-and-see attitude. Those who sold a large number of shares had to have a considerable number of buyers to absorb them. Various news, whether positive or negative, could not be concretely confirmed. The consistent principle of the big players in the market, whether long or short, has not changed. Without major news, the market price is not easy to change. The situation in the morning and afternoon was almost exactly the same. The afternoon was comparatively firmer. Tong Shun sold throughout, Tai Feng bought throughout, Xin Fu also had needs, Jiu Feng slightly replenished. Sheng Da, Ju Xin, and No. 38 all sold. Nos. 14, 41, Hong Da, Ding Kang all purchased. The closing prices in the morning and afternoon were exactly the same. As a result, Class B fell slightly by a dime due to delivery reasons. Class A had no honor or disgrace. The rest were slightly better by about a dime. The total transaction volume was estimated to be over 500,000 yuan. A brief summary table is listed below.

Stock trading: 40 shares of Qingfeng Textile Factory were traded, with a price of 50 yuan each.

Yesterday, the stock market in the Public Exchange opened sluggishly. Then, the selling orders determined the night before came one after another. The market was immersed in a flood of selling, and prices plummeted severely. All the stocks sold were disposed of at market prices, regardless of fluctuations. As a result, many industrial stocks hit record lows. Near noon, a large number of buying orders poured in and were snapped up. The stormy selling momentum was stopped. The market situation turned sharply upward, and prices were lifted up, rising sharply, and even exceeding the level at the opening. This kind of sharp rebound in price caused the sellers to sell again in the afternoon, but it was almost completely absorbed. Most of the closing prices recovered to the morning closing prices.

Rubber stocks performed better, and there were constant buyers throughout the day. The closing price was also extremely stable.

London, 4th (Monday) Electricity: The listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds today remained stable. The prices of bonds up and down were unchanged.

London, 4th (Monday) Electricity: The listed prices of stocks of British Far East companies today: Bank stocks rose again. The stock of McCallee Bank rose by 3 shillings and 9 pence, with a price of 9 pounds and 5 shillings. The stock of HSBC Bank's British registry rose by 2.5 pounds, with a price of 93 pounds. The stock of the Hong Kong registry rose by 1 pound, with a price of 9 pounds and half a pound. However, the rubber stock of Gulake Lin Bang fell by 7.5 pence, to 21 shillings and 10 pence. The rest were flat.

### Grains: Foreign Rice Floods In, Rice Market Plummets, Over 40,000 Bags Arrive Again Yesterday, Unofficial Market for Domestic Rice Also Eases

Yesterday's rice market continued to decline, with drastic changes rarely seen in recent times. Both buyers and sellers feared suffering unexpected losses. The market slumped, and morale was discouraged, and they rushed to sell. Recycled goods were pushed out one after another. How could the local shops be foolish? Seeing the sellers wavering and the market full of goods, they slightly increased their purchases and did not dare to buy too much. Therefore, the shouting price at the opening of the morning market was two or three corners lower. Later, they went downstream step by step, depreciating by six or seven corners. For example, Saigon's Special Grade 1 was sold from 47.5 yuan to 47.2-3 yuan, 47 yuan. Fire-jiao was sold from 46 yuan to 45.5 yuan, 45.2-3 yuan. Mid-range goods such as Saigon's No. 2 Small Pattern, No. 2 Siamese Tokyo, and pointed glutinous rice were especially sluggish, falling by about one yuan. Foreign rice was crowded due to all shipments arriving on the same day. One or two ships arrived in Shanghai every day. In addition to the continuous orders placed after the previous day, foreign merchants were still continuing to sell. Importers disliked the high price and did not continue to finalize the deal. Even recycled futures lacked buyers under the pressure of floating accounts seeking to sell. Little Jiao March was still lacking a buyer at 51 yuan. Nos. 1 and 2 Saigon lowered by half a yuan and still had no way out. The entire market only had 200 tons of recycled No. 2 Siamese rice being traded, with a price of 52 yuan to 51.9 yuan.

A Large Number of Imported Foreign Rice Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday. The Italian ship Man Lin Sa Niu Tuo (transliterated) transported 8,052 bags of foreign rice and 7,113 bags of broken rice from Saigon. In addition, 20,717 bags of corn (i.e., pearl rice) were also transported. The corn was handled by French merchants Fuka Foreign Firm Heyi Da Fu, etc. Most of the foreign rice was handled by Jian Yuan Company. It was imported at about 11:00 yesterday morning and was docked at Hongkou Shuntai Wharf to unload. The Taikoo Company's Suzhou wheel directly loaded 20,534 bags of foreign rice from Siam, and the Jinan wheel loaded 2,724 bags from Haiphong, and 6,896 bags from Hong Kong. The Jardine Matheson Company's Desheng wheel loaded 2,026 bags from Hong Kong. All arrived in port before noon yesterday. A total of four wheels transported 45,320 bags (Zu).

Glutinous rice also depreciated by half a yuan along with it. Liyang Special Yuan was 42.5 yuan, and Danyang Special Yuan was 41.5 yuan. The number of thick and thin japonica rice and early and late indica rice from the mainland sources transferred out from Hongkou yesterday was very small, still only over 300 bags of early and late indica rice from Nan Gang. The unofficial transactions outside the market were said to be still sparse. The opening price also continued to decline by half a yuan. Looking at the trend of the rice market, based on yesterday's phenomenon, it seems that it is still difficult to gain a foothold, or there may be a more violent drop. Judging from the previous price drop, the lowest price of Saigon's Grade 1 was 43.5 yuan, which is still three or four yuan lower than yesterday's price. Considering this drop, if there is no hope of a turning point in a short time, then "the road is straight down, back to the original market price before, it is really possible. Or if there is an unexpected large number of futures arriving at that time, then returning to the closing prices at the end of last year is also imaginable. If it can be so, it will be a great fortune for the people's food.

### Flour Market Continues to Weaken, There Is a Rumor That Export Flour Has Stopped Giving Tax Bills

Yesterday's flour market continued to weaken. The price of the No. 2 flour mill was unchanged during the flat selling period. Apart from the limited 7,500 bags, there was no surplus to give. Therefore, those who needed it still had to rely on recycled flour. However, due to the sluggish sales of customers in recent days, it was heard that there was a sudden suspension of tax bills for foreign ports, so people's hearts were disheartened. The buying and selling outside the industry had already come to an end. The entire market only had the inland countryside to clear, and thousands of bags of old brand stack orders were traded, with prices of 14.6 yuan and 6.5 points, slightly looser than the previous day. There is no hope for the market to expand for the time being.

Yesterday, wheat was also dull. There was little development in the clearing of Hua factories and export gangs. The market rumored that a certain factory had continued to order foreign wheat, but the factory denied it. Therefore, domestic wheat was unwilling to be sold off easily. The Suzhou white wheat opened yesterday still required a price of 14.5 yuan. The fixed Changzhou wheat opened at 24 yuan, with six cars traded.

### Yarn and Cotton: Exchange Rates Slightly Tighten, Yarn Market Revives, Double Horse Spot Goods Recovered 8 Yuan

Yesterday, the falling yarn market recovered somewhat. This was because foreign exchange tightened slightly again, causing the various parties to regroup, buy back again, and turn the market tighter, rising up. However, the actual demand was not as large as the previous day. At present, the yarn market is deeply afraid of being on the path of wavering. The long parties are still optimistic about the March period and never give up on absorbing the amount. However, the short parties are thinking of taking a step back, as the price has reached a high level, and are unwilling to take more actions.

The opening trend of spot yarn in the morning was flat. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse in March was 892 yuan. As soon as this market opened, the buyers came again to add more, and the momentum was tighter and more expensive. The market price gradually opened to 903 yuan. When prices were rising, the short parties also came to sell and add more, and the market situation was slightly exhausted, and then entered the 900 yuan mark. By the time of the close, it was heard that the foreign exchange market had contracted, and the market situation had revived. It was found that 1,958 bags were transacted in half a day. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 8 yuan. Today, 100 pieces of yarn were transported to Haiphong. The amount of money bought by the various gangs is divided as follows:

### Factory Offices Stop, Cotton Market Ordinary, Yao Cotton Arrives in Shanghai One After Another

Cotton trading was relatively clear. The factory seemed to have no office stomach. As for American cotton, although it rebounded, Indian cotton still tended to be flat and tired, so people's hearts were ordinary. As for the sources in northern Jiangsu, a total of 1,246 bags of Tong cotton were purchased. The transaction situation of the current cotton is listed on the left:

Fire Machine Grass Bag 196.00 Fellow Trades 139 bags

Fire Machine Wooden Frame 202.25 Also 100 pieces

Meter Lin 264.00 Also 200 pieces

Tongzhou 204.00 203.00 Also 200 bags

The American Hengda Foreign Firm purchased cotton in eastern Zhejiang, and previously sent a special wheel to transport two batches, totaling 19,000 bags. The above situation was recorded in the previous report. It is now known that the Lihe Foreign Firm's Moufu wheel also loaded more than 5,000 bags of cotton purchased by the firm from Ningbo yesterday (4th), which has been taken away from the firm's side of the boat. It is said that another batch will be transported within the day, and a large batch of American cotton will also arrive in Shanghai (Zu).

Another news from the foreign cotton market: the New York cotton market was very firm when it opened yesterday morning. It rose first due to the purchase of speculators, and then due to the purchase of fellow traders and overseas cotton merchants. As a result, the closing price rose by 12 to 13 pounds more than the previous day. India, including forecasts, rose by more than 4 rubles yesterday. Egypt fell by more than 20 pounds.

In Shanghai, the transaction of foreign cotton was very firm yesterday, and the transaction among fellow traders was quite active, and the selling price was very high. However, the factory fellow traders were very quiet, as were the Japanese manufacturers. The price of the factory was converted at an exchange rate of 6.6875 yuan for American cotton yesterday, as follows:

20 Count American Meter Lin 262.00

Also Subordinate Grade 251.10

32 Count Also 274.50

Also Subordinate Grade 263.70

42 Count Also 278.50

Also Subordinate Grade 263.50

### Piece Goods: Yarn Market Rebounds, Cloth Prices Improve

Domestic Cloth: The cloth market this morning opened with a reversal of the ten-day slump, with retail sellers releasing white goods, and asking prices dropping by one dime to two and a half dimes per piece. However, in the afternoon, the exchange rate tightened, and the yarn market rebounded. Cloth prices also followed suit with a ten-dime increase, ultimately resulting in a leveling out with the previous day's closing price. Confidence stabilized, and purchasing interest slightly increased. Local wholesale transactions included over 500 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth and grey cloth. The Ningbo merchants were selling white-ground printed cloth very well. Wenzhou merchants were dealing with over 200 pieces of printed cloth, colored cloth, bleached cloth, coarse and fine cloth. Quanzhou merchants were dealing with over 100 pieces of printed cloth, fancy cotton cloth, bleached cloth, striped bleached cloth, and poplin. Guangdong merchants were also dealing with nearly 100 pieces. Sichuan and Yunnan merchants were dealing with over 6,000 pieces of fine cloth, shirting, blue cloth, and woolen cloth.

Eastern Cloth: Due to the rise in yarn prices, local merchants' purchasing interest intensified again. Fine cloth prices surged by over five dimes per piece in both the morning and afternoon sessions. In the later market, the closing price for top-quality fine cloth was 27.40 yuan, and the futures price for this month was 27.80 yuan. "Four Gentlemen" serge increased to 8.275 dimes per yard, with futures at 8.45 dimes. The total daily transaction volume for fine cloth exceeded 1,000 pieces, and serge also reached 400 pieces.

Exports: Today, 78 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, and 88 pieces were shipped to Haiphong.

### Coal: Firewood Stockpiles Dwindle

Firewood sources have been blocked since last winter by certain parties, obstructing inland rivers. This has not been resolved, causing merchants and travelers to be afraid to procure supplies. Consequently, local stockpiles are dwindling, and prices are becoming increasingly favorable. Large-sized "anti-white" firewood is selling for only 1.5 bundles per yuan, second-grade Siko firewood for 2.4 dimes, small bundles of long firewood for 5 bundles, and old plank firewood for 8 bundles. It is rumored that some goods have arrived at a certain market in Hongkou, but they are mostly poplar wood, which is damp and cannot be used immediately, and the price is not cheap either.

### Macau (II)

Zhang Tian’an’s "Illustrated Treatise on Macau" states: "Initially, all seagoing vessels docked directly below the city of Guangzhou. However, during the Ming Dynasty, due to concerns about Japanese pirates, they were moved to Dianbai in Gaozhou Prefecture. Later, in the 14th year of the Jiajing era, foreign merchants requested permission to enter Macau to sun and dry their goods due to the dampness and humidity caused by wind and rain. Permission was granted, and they were required to pay a tariff of 20,000 taels. This marked the beginning of the presence of foreign chiefs in Macau. In the 29th year of the Wanli era, the Westerner Matteo Ricci entered China and settled in Macau. Afterward, the number of Westerners arriving increased, and other foreign groups gradually withdrew. During the early Qing Dynasty, due to maritime threats, coastal areas were evacuated and taxes were not collected. Westerners instead paid a land rent of 500 taels. This marked the beginning of the Westerners' settlement in Macau." According to the latter account, the presence of foreigners in Macau began in the 14th year of the Jiajing era, not in the early Longqing era. The Portuguese likely arrived in China before the Jiajing era. The "Complete Book of National Diseases" records an incident in the 12th year of the Zhengde era involving a Portuguese ship invading Guangdong. Furthermore, Portugal was the first to explore these lands, so it is unlikely that they would have waited several decades before reaching Guangdong. At that time, there was no land rent. Our dynasty, with its vast heavenly grace, followed a policy of appeasement, mindful of their long voyages across the ocean and distant arrivals by boat. Therefore, they were exempted from taxes, not even requiring trifling amounts. The Portuguese, grateful for the holy grace, desired to reciprocate. However, knowing that the imperial court did not value exotic goods, they did not dare to present even rare items. Instead, they voluntarily paid a land rent of over 500 taels to the local officials annually, considering it a fortunate loan of a branch and an expression of gratitude. This was requested by border officials and approved, so it remained unchanged from the Kangxi era to the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras. Therefore, Macau was initially a place for various Southeast Asian foreigners to display their goods, and later a place for Western countries to reside. The Portuguese paid annual rent, and China received tribute, which had been the case for a long time. However, since the country has been plagued by many misfortunes, border officials no longer care about the small amount of land rent, and the Portuguese have also stopped paying it, which has been the case for over thirty years.

### A Word to Working Youth

— Ji Fufang

In this distorted development on the isolated island, it is very unsuitable for upright young people. Especially for the majority of working youth, they have lost the constraints of education, and during their spare time, there is no specific work to restrict them from doing. If there is no proper entertainment and recreation, it is inevitable that they will seek out their dissolute life in their spare time.

Around Shanghai, in the so-called "evil lands," gambling dens and opium dens are numerous. Transformed dance halls and vulgar theaters are all seductive nets that lure young people. Stepping into those places is like losing half of one's life.

Well-behaved young people will not automatically run to take risks, but among relatives, friends, and neighbors, there are always those who are good patrons of those places, and they also have a mentality of wanting others to go with them. So, in their conversations, they inevitably exaggerate the situation there, saying that someone made a fortune gambling, or someone spent a few dimes and won hundreds of yuan. Even if you don't gamble, the cigarettes, sweets, and delicacies there are available to eat at will. As for the inside stories of dance halls and theaters, hearing about them makes one's heart itch even more.

Young people are all curious. Having these "strange places" always makes them want to see them for themselves. Initially, they only have the purpose of trying it once, and they also know that they don't have the ability to play there often. But once they get there, their minds become unclear, they become anesthetized. If they don't go there to kill time, their hearts are always uneasy, or if they lose money, they still want to recoup their losses, and if they win money, they want to win more.

Most working youth are not very well-off. At first, some expenses are met with pocket money. After a long time, their ambitions grow, and the small amount is not enough to squander.

Therefore, we see many working youth often neglecting their affairs, frequently taking leave, not getting enough sleep at night, and not being able to invigorate their spirits when working. This is still a minor matter. Even more people misappropriate public funds or owe large sums of money in order to spend money, always resulting in unemployment, decline, and a tarnished reputation... A good young person is completely beyond redemption!

Therefore, I hope that the general working youth should reflect on themselves. The current life is already very difficult, and even if they can barely support themselves, they should still consider the future. Now is a turbulent era. When the new era of construction arrives in the future, will their skills be able to cope? Are they willing to maintain their occupation forever and not seek advancement?

Therefore, I advise the general youth to study a subject at this time to prepare for their future career, or at least they should cultivate a skill.

At present, those places are colorful and have everything, but we should restrain our dissolute hearts.

We should study knowledge, improve our skills, and go to libraries, reading groups, or cram schools in our spare time.

### Ways to Make a Living

— Lingling

The other day, I went to the ×× Biscuit Factory on ×× Road to buy biscuits. At that time, there was an old foreign lady also buying the same thing. The clerk was really clever. He pressed his finger on the weight on the scale. Of course, the object on this side, due to the technique on the other side, was reduced in weight considerably. When it was my turn, that clerk still used the "way to make a living" method. Because I had already seen it, I asked him to re-weigh it. The trick was exposed, and he had to add more, almost adding five ounces of biscuits.

Even on these biscuits, they use this trick. No wonder the rice weevils who always seek ways to make a living need to use the "attention to rice buyers" trick that Mr. Cheng mentioned in the newspaper the other day. Therefore, in the current era of rising prices, this isolated island is full of this new method of "making a living." I hope gentlemen and ladies will pay attention at all times.

Chapter 21: Managing Principles by Mixing Fibers, Promoting Machinery to Aid Literary Achievements

At that time, the two Miss He were having a very pleasant conversation with Jiang Zhenrui. Jiang Jingrong said, "This time in Beiping, I spent a few days with your father and heard that both of you are textile experts. We were happy and initiated this silk weaving factory. Originally, we wanted to have more capital and do it on a large scale, but your father said: 'You are handling things for the first time and have less experience. After you have achieved results, you can expand.' The funds from all parties have already been transferred to my relative, Mr. Ye Songfen's bank. When you two ladies need funds during the establishment, you can withdraw them at any time. I can now hand over the bank drafts and a letter from your father to you two, as well as their plans, opinions, shareholder list, etc." As he spoke, he took out two bank drafts and a letter that Mr. He wrote to his two daughters from a document folder. Jiang Jingrong also said, "I heard that one of you two ladies is going to Europe and America for investigation, which is the best thing. I have been abroad once before, but it was just a brief tour. How can it compare to the years you two ladies have spent abroad, studying in depth? Moreover, the technology in the United States is changing rapidly, and there is often a new invention, which leads to a new change. We are old and decaying, but we have some experience in running silk factories in China. If you two ladies regard me as an old horse that knows the way, I can tell you everything I know." The two Miss He also said, "We are young and inexperienced, and we rely entirely on Uncle Jiang's guidance at all times. We will have to bother you often in the future." Then, Jiang Jingrong kept the two ladies for lunch at the International Hotel before they returned. The discussions during the meal were also nothing more than about silk fabrics. According to Jiang Jingrong, "Modern fabrics are gradually trending towards a mixture, and we can no longer distinguish between silk fabrics, cotton fabrics, wool fabrics, hemp fabrics, and other categories. In short, its principle is the same, just fibers. For example, in the silk factory we are running now, most of the pure raw material is silk, but there is also a lot of rayon mixed in. And many cotton fabric factories also weave fabrics with silk and wool mixed in. The same goes for woolen mills, some with silk, some with cotton, and some with hemp. So, at this moment, it seems that various fabrics are clearly divided, such as silk, cloth, wool, and ramie. I am afraid that in the future, the mixture will be so severe that we will not be able to distinguish them. Fortunately, we are adapting to the times, and we will weave whatever material people like to wear. However, people who wear clothes rarely create new styles themselves. Opening up new trends is the responsibility of the textile manufacturers." (246)

### An Absent Student

— Qiang Gong

I don't understand the reason why Huang Da has been frequently absent from class recently. Some classmates say he is sick, some say he has gone to the countryside, and some say he has already found a shop and is apprenticing there. But this is not the truth. In any case, a person cannot be sick, go to the countryside, and apprentice at the same time. These are clearly unreliable rumors.

Huang Da does very well in his studies. He is a smart child. He knows the suffering of being out of school, and he knows the necessity of continuing his studies even more. But material things have not helped him, so he has no choice but to find a night school to satisfy his intellectual hunger.

Such a diligent and enterprising child should not be absent from class without a reason. However, I haven't seen Huang Da come to class for two weeks. Is he really sick? Did he really go to the countryside? Did he really enter a business to apprentice? Finally, I also began to doubt. In fact, students at night schools of a supplementary nature come in waves and then disappear without knowing where they went. At the beginning of the semester, the place is full, but at the end of the semester, it is deserted. So why bother caring so much about one Huang Da?

One winter evening, the snow had covered a thin layer. Huang Da, this hardworking child, hurried into the school to attend class. A piece of leftover bread leaked out of his umbrella, and the classmates mocked him. After the first class, this struggling student stood alone next to the sand filter tap, soaking the bread in the sand filter to complete his only dinner.

Later, according to reports from other students, Huang Da's leftover bread was picked up next to the back door of a tall building. He managed to get permission from the head chef and often went there to collect some scraps for dinner. The degree of wind-drying and hardening naturally meant that he had to soak it in tap water. Isn't this child's misfortune even for a meal?

A postcard from a slum address wrote:

"Student Huang Da has been going every day for half a month from 3:00 PM to receive steamed buns on my mother's orders. I have to wait until 6:00 PM to get two small steamed buns, so I cannot come to class. Please forgive me, teacher. I don't know when I will be able to study again. The two small steamed buns are the size of teacups. Eating them is not enough to fill my stomach. My mother said I should receive them, so I have to go. In fact, it doesn't help my stomach... ..."

### Alarm Bell

— A letter from a Woolen Shop Apprentice Regarding the Embezzlement Case

To the Editors of Spring and Autumn: Respectfully, I am an apprentice in an old-fashioned shop. Because I see the heavy darkness in the shop, I am writing to ask you to publish it, so that people in society will know.

I am learning my trade in a shop that sells both wool and rayon. At first, I thought this occupation would fit my ideal. Later I discovered that the wool, rayon, and even knitting needles sold in the shop were all mixed with inferior goods that had been repackaged. At the end of the year, they actually earned more than 559,000 yuan.

Therefore, from now on, I no longer want to pollute my pure heart and do things that betray my conscience. I have decided to leave this dissolute and shameless isolated island as soon as possible and rush to the embrace of the motherland. At the same time, I hope that patriotic compatriots will not unknowingly give money to people you do not want to give it to.

### Applied Religion (IV)

Every Sunday, we pray, "Thy kingdom come!" What does that mean? It means that there is a world in which there is very little suffering and disease. In which women are respected, children are not forgotten, and the elderly are not abandoned; in which the value of people is more important than machines, and human life is more noble than profit. In other words, there is a society in which the goal is not how much you can earn, but how much you can give and how much you can serve. We are children of God and have a responsibility to help each other. If our religion can focus more on life, and we truly put our beliefs into practice, do you think that there would still be so many people in our society, in the world, on the verge of starvation? I remember visiting a beautifully decorated summer villa in the United States: nurses wearing beautiful uniforms served many dogs, and the houses where the dogs lived were much better than the ones I hoped to buy. There were dance rooms, bedrooms, each with their names written on them. They had exquisite food, scheduled brushing and bathing, private doctors, cooks, and cemeteries. Not far away, there were many slums with unusable houses and no sanitation facilities. This picture of people being worse than dogs made my blood boil. Did Jesus not say, "Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me"? He sacrificed everything for people and helped people in the community every day to make their lives better, nobler, and cleaner. His religion was daily service and sacrifice. He made himself happy and brought peace to others through his actions. We, as followers of Jesus, must also do this. (End)

### US President Roosevelt Proposes Filming Columbus, Hires Ernst Lubitsch as Director

— Lin Gong

There was a period in the United States when historical films were popular. Hollywood's eight major companies used all their efforts to collect historical stories and make films. On the one hand, it was to cater to the psychology of the audience, and on the other hand, if a film made with the history of a certain country as its theme had a place to promote the greatness of that country, that country would usually allocate a huge bonus to the company. In order to benefit from both aspects, every producer once spent countless efforts on historical films. After 1937, the film industry suddenly changed, and the audience's attention was focused on war and song and dance films, and historical films lost their original position.

However, some directors, due to the limitations of the script, still occasionally had echoes of filming historical films, such as the recently released "The Crusades," "The War of the Roses," "The Bloody History of Napoleon," "Chapayev," "Mutiny on the Bounty," "The Life of Emile Zola," "A Tale of Two Cities," "The Story of the Sun," and "The Iron Heel," all of which are immortal works of historical films. For a time, the box office success was amazing, and it has indeed exceeded any other type of film, and it is equally supported by the masses in all countries of the world. Therefore, many directors in Hollywood still insist on increasing the filming of historical films, but due to the weak vision of the producers, the only big director in the world film industry who continues to film historical films is Ernst Lubitsch.

According to a recent news report in the American newspaper "St. Louis Post-Dispatch," US President Roosevelt will ask the big director Ernst Lubitsch to direct a film about Columbus's discovery of the New World. The US President has now approved the allocation of US$2 million for the filming fee. If the director's performance can achieve excellent results, there will be another US$1 million bonus. Of course, under the invitation of the US President, how could he not agree? However, because MGM and Paramount will ask Ernst Lubitsch to direct two historical films in the autumn of this year, in order to account for their own business, it is said that they have requested the US government for the filming time of the film to be limited to five months, and it is expected that there will be no problems and it can be resolved smoothly. However, the recent lack of talent for filming historical films is an indisputable fact. Therefore, when signing the contract, Errol Flynn and Fredric March were also dragged along as an attachment. The salary for each person is US$300,000. It is said that Errol Flynn and Fredric March's own companies can also agree to let them go outside to film. The date of the big start of filming is in the near future.

Reader's Opinion

### Some Wishes

— Guangxiong

Since the film production atmosphere on the isolated island shifted to the production of historical costume dramas, it is like bamboo shoots after a rain, producing endlessly. This can be said to be a great success for the development of historical costume dramas. However, because historical costume dramas are too prevalent in various theaters, people will inevitably forget their meaning and not feel the direct pain, so it is necessary to change the atmosphere again. Now, some unconscious friends on this isolated island can also use films to awaken them.

At present, speculation is really too rampant, raising the prices of various items to the highest level. The first people to be awakened here are speculators. I think it is very possible to adapt Mr. Mao Dun's "Midnight" for performance. In addition, I hope there will be more literary films, which are most suitable for general students.

After Wu Cun directed "Wang Baochuan," he returned to Guohua to prepare for his new work, "The Amorous History of Su San." It was originally scheduled to start filming in the middle of last month, but Wu suddenly suffered from a throat ailment and was admitted to the Shilong Hospital for treatment, so it was temporarily shelved. Now I know that Wu has fully recovered and been discharged from the hospital, and "Su San's Amorous History" started filming yesterday. Another new work by Guohua, "Li A Mao and Dongfang Shuo," has been completed after "Hero in Troubled Times."

"Confucius" director Fei Mu and Zhang Yi have recently become very interested in dramas. It is said that they have formed the "China Drama Club," and the first play is scheduled to be "Emperor Gaozu of Han," with the script written by Fei Mu's younger brother Fei Tai.

### Wronged Souls in the Sea of People

— Qihua

"Wronged Souls in the Sea of People" is a family tragedy, but this tragedy is latent rather than exposed. Therefore, it may not be as easy to excite the audience as "Cold Night Qin Pick," but on the other hand, those fragmented scenes are exposing the cause of the family tragedy everywhere. When watching Paul Muni's child singing that song in the bathtub, in addition to being moved, it may also make every audience member recall the cause of the tragedy and reflect on themselves.

There are some discords between couples that are superficial, and some that are latent. Edmund Goulding tells us in everyday life how Paul Muni and his wife feel. How does he protect Qin Bailan Yin? He did not waste a scene, but accumulated these many reasons and then exploded them at an appropriate time. As long as we don't feel bored, it is his successful place.

Paul Muni tells us in this play that he is indeed an all-around actor. Qin Bailan Yin and Flavia Robson, who plays Paul's wife, are also excellent.

### Silver Sea Anecdotes

China's first Buddhist film, "Avalokitesvara," started filming yesterday morning. A consecration ceremony was held at the Guanyin Temple. Yihua attached great importance to this. In addition to respectfully inviting the high monk Chi Song from Shengxian Temple to preside over the ceremony, Wen Lanting, Guan Jiongzhi, Huang Hanzhi, and others were present. All Yihua employees and actors lined up to shoot newsreels. Newcomer Ziwei and lead actress Zhang Cuihong and others wore gray cassocks and worshipped sincerely.

"The Assassin of the King of Qin" is Yan Youxiang's directorial debut. Playwright Ye Gong is also making his debut as a screenwriter. Lead actor Lu Ming is also filming his last film before leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong. Movie fans are very interested in this. It is said that it will be screened after "Peerless Beauty" at "Xin Guang." There will be a test screening before the screening.

When Nanhua Film Queen Li Qinian comes to Shanghai, it is said that she will hold a grand banquet and dance party, which is scheduled to be held at the Xianle or Bailedu. The Shanghai art world has collectively created a "Betty Kai."

### Tarzan Seeks a Wife: Coming to an End Soon

Johnny Weissmuller's new work after "Tarzan Finds a Son," which he co-stars with Hallywood Shena, is "Tarzan Seeks a Wife." It is said that the film is a companion piece to "Tarzan Finds a Son." After more than seven months of filming, it will soon be completed. It is also said that in response to the requests of the majority of people in the United States, it has been decided to film one-half of the film in color, so it is expected that the film will be even more sensational when it is released.

Fu Yunhu's Zhaiqu Tales

### Introducing Fu Yuntai

— Su Shaoqing

Miss Fu Yuntai has been studying Lao Sheng opera with me for three years. Her aptitude is good, and she is quite diligent. She can perform nearly thirty operas. Her inner energy is abundant, surpassing that of men. Her voice is high and she is initially accustomed to the Ban Diao style, but she is now developing other styles. She sings both joyful and melancholy tunes with ease. Fortunately, her voice is high but not narrow. She can sing two or three major operas in a row without exhaustion, and she barely needs to drink water. Her voice is truly rare among women. Peking opera originated in rural areas and originally emphasized high-pitched sounds, valuing the ability to stir the spirit of the masses. However, in the last thirty years, voices have become increasingly weak. Is this good for the country and society? We should return to our roots, advocating and promoting vigorous tones to meet the needs of the new nation and the new people. However, deeply ingrained habits are hard to change, and customs are difficult to transform. While I have this aspiration, I lack the exceptional voice to achieve it, leading to nothing but empty words, regret, and shame, which has been the case for more than just a day. In the past, I had hoped to educate talented individuals with my knowledge to realize my ideals and help the opera world achieve a restoration of order. I have encountered probably thousands of young people. Some have the looks, physique, and intelligence suitable for a Lao Sheng role, but those with truly exceptional voices are as rare as phoenixes. Without an excellent voice, it is difficult to even cope, let alone talk about being high-pitched. Three years ago, while I was talking about opera on the radio, I happened to meet Miss Fu Yuntai. In addition to her voice, she also possesses other qualities: a long, square face, large, long eyes, and a medium-tall build, all of which are suitable for a Lao Sheng role. Moreover, she has an upward-striving spirit, without mournful tones, which aligns with my ideals. Perhaps she will be the one to restore high-pitched tones in the future. She will be performing at the Huang Gong Theatre for three days, performing "Catching and Releasing Cao," "Fish Intestine Sword," and "Empty City Stratagem and Beheading Ma Su." If she continues to perform, then the "Second Visit to the Palace" and "Ascending to Heaven Terrace" from the Wang Jiuling school, and the "Wen Zhao Pass" and "Conceding Chengdu" from the Han Guifen school, will be offered in succession. Her skills are limited and her experience is shallow. Her word pronunciation is not yet fully correct, and her acting is not yet proficient. I sincerely hope that experts from all over the country will correct and support her, and give her strict criticism. That would be very fortunate indeed.
