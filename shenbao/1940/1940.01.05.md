### Failure of Three-Pronged Advance on Shaoguan; Japanese Troops in Northern Guangdong Retreat on All Fronts; Main Japanese Force Suffers Crushing Defeat North of Yingde, Annihilating a Brigade; Chinese Forces East of the Railway Drive Japanese Out of Wengyuan; Good News Spreads on New Year's Day, Boosting Chinese Morale

Hong Kong – The Japanese army on the Yuehan Railway line mobilized crack troops, launching a three-pronged offensive aimed at Shaoguan. The Chinese side had prepared for this, allowing the enemy to advance deep before launching a surprise attack. The Japanese suffered tens of thousands of casualties and severe losses and are now retreating on all fronts. (4th dispatch)

Chongqing – According to Chinese military sources, after the Japanese army was severely defeated south of Shaoguan by Chinese forces, the Japanese offensive in Guangdong province has collapsed. The result of this battle is that the Japanese suffered 10,000 deaths and lost 100 tanks. The entire Japanese front is reportedly retreating southward. The entire city of Chongqing is celebrating this victory. This morning, all Chinese newspapers published the news in large characters and included special commentaries emphasizing the significance of this battle. When the news first arrived in Chongqing, some newspapers rushed out extra editions. According to Chinese military sources, the main Japanese forces advancing north along the Yuehan Railway suffered a crushing defeat north of Yingde. One Japanese brigade was annihilated. Simultaneously, Chinese forces east of the railway reportedly drove the Japanese out of Wengyuan. Chinese forces south of that location cut off the retreating Japanese into several segments. Chinese forces along the railway line and east of the railway have reportedly converged and are continuing to advance south. A Chinese military spokesperson commented on this victory, saying that the Japanese army in Guangdong, after receiving reinforcements from a new division sent from Japan, as well as troops and marines withdrawn from Shenzhen and Shantou, launched a three-pronged attack on Shaoguan. Chinese forces withdrew to areas east and west of the Yuehan Railway, allowing the Japanese to advance north and penetrate deep into the rear of the Chinese lines. After the Japanese reached Wengyuan, the Chinese forces launched a general counteroffensive. After 48 hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese began a general retreat. The abandoned corpses numbered 3,000 at Quan Zhuyuan and Shatin, 2,000 at Niubeiji and Lvtian, and 1,000 at Lianjiangkou and Pajiangkou. Over a hundred Japanese tanks fell into newly constructed Chinese traps and were destroyed. Because the Japanese were retreating, they were intercepted by Chinese forces along the way. The spokesperson also stated that as the Japanese retreated south, they set fire to villages along the way. It is said that when the retreating Japanese forces collapsed at Meigang (transliteration), local farmers joined the attack. The Japanese suffered over 10,000 casualties in this battle. The Chinese forces captured thousands of steel helmets and a large quantity of military equipment and ammunition. The Central Daily News commented on the great significance of this victory, saying that the collapse of the Japanese offensive in Guangdong province foreshadows the Japanese defeat in Guangxi province. We dare say that the Japanese will not be able to withdraw from Chinese territory in an orderly fashion but will instead flee for their lives. (4th Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing – A Chinese military spokesperson told reporters this afternoon that the Chinese army in northern Guangdong launched a counteroffensive on New Year's Day and, after 48 hours of fierce fighting, forced the Japanese army to retreat on all fronts. In late December, the Japanese army advanced north from Guangzhou in three columns. The central column attacked from Conghua, the right wing departed from Longmen, and the left wing advanced along the Yuehan Railway. The Japanese wings, especially the right flank, advanced rapidly. Their left wing reached Yingde, and the right wing crossed Meigang (transliteration) and reached Wengyuan and Sanhua. The Chinese commander decided to block the central column and, at the same time, Chinese forces on both sides of the railway attacked the Japanese wings. The central Japanese column was blocked by Chinese forces in the mountains near Liang Kou (transliteration) and Niubeiji. On New Year's Day, Chinese forces in the Wengyuan area launched a two-pronged attack on the Japanese right wing, one column moving from southern Jiangxi, attacking from the northeast, and the other column moving from Shaoguan, attacking from the northwest. Simultaneously, another Chinese unit attacked the Japanese rear at Meigang (transliteration). The Japanese on this front were ultimately forced to retreat towards Longmen. As for the Japanese left wing on the railway line, it had already retreated to Lianjiangkou, south of Yingde. (4th Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing – According to a Chinese military spokesperson today, the Japanese "Christmas Offensive" launched in northern Guangdong has completely collapsed. The Japanese suffered 12,000 casualties. There are no fewer than 3,000 Japanese soldiers' corpses abandoned on the battlefield at Liangkou, north of Conghua. This Chinese victory is the second major victory since the victory in northern Hunan. The Japanese originally intended to capture Shaoguan as their goal, but after this disastrous defeat, the enemy's courage has been shaken, and the remaining troops no longer have the courage to attack Shaoguan again. According to the spokesperson, the Chinese side, due to the Japanese concentration of forces to attempt to seize northern Guangdong, specially mobilized elite troops and launched a general offensive against the Japanese army on New Year's Day. Before long, in the Liangkou area, they completely annihilated over a thousand men of one part of the elite Imperial Guard division recently dispatched by the Japanese. Therefore, the remnants of the Imperial Guard division fled towards the central Japanese column, and the other two columns also collapsed southward. According to reports, the Japanese had been preparing for this offensive in northern Guangdong for two months, but it collapsed after two days of intense fighting. When reporters asked whether the Japanese army in central Guangdong intended to launch another offensive in northern Guangdong, the spokesperson said that if the Japanese could launch another offensive, we would welcome it, as it would give us another opportunity to strike them. Furthermore, the Japanese advance this time involved mobilizing reinforcements from Kowloon, Sanshui, Guangzhou, Conghua, and even Japan itself, in an attempt to succeed. It is no easy task, so another attempt to attack must wait for some time. Finally, the reason why the Japanese blockaded the Pearl River again on December 17 was to prevent outsiders from seeing the movement of their troops. (4th United Press dispatch)

Chongqing – This reporter learned of the great victory of the Chinese army in the southern section of the Yuehan Railway and made a special visit to the spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission on the 3rd to inquire. I was told the following: This time, in addition to the original three divisions, one mixed brigade, and over ten thousand marines stationed in Guangdong, the Japanese also drew a part of their most powerful Imperial Guard regiment and mobilized Japanese troops from Chaozhou and Shantou and Shenzhen, launching a large-scale offensive aimed at Shaoguan. (According to Japanese orders and maps obtained by the Chinese army, the targets of all Japanese columns pointed to Shaoguan.) They advanced north in three columns. The Chinese army had ambushed on both sides long in advance, waiting for them to drive deep before surrounding and annihilating them. The Japanese army did not feel the danger until they advanced to the vicinity of Wengyuan, realizing that the disastrous defeat in northern Hunan was about to be repeated. At that time, the Chinese ambushers suddenly rose up and launched a fierce attack from all sides. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, several thousand Japanese were annihilated at Lvtian. One regiment of the Imperial Guard regiment was annihilated. Dozens of their tanks were ambushed, unable to escape, and were all burned by the Chinese. Therefore, the Japanese left and right columns were greatly embarrassed and retreated in confusion. They were again blocked by the Chinese on the way, suffering extremely heavy casualties. In summary, the Japanese suffered tens of thousands of casualties, and the Chinese captured thousands of steel helmets, countless guns, artillery, and military supplies. At this point, the Japanese army in the southern section of the Yuehan Railway completely collapsed. The Chinese army also achieved a great victory, creating a second northern Hunan. Currently, Chinese forces on all fronts are still advancing fiercely and pursuing the retreating Japanese army. There should be even better battle results reported in the next day or two. (3rd dispatch)

Hong Kong – Fighting on the Yuehan Railway front remains fierce. Japanese troops at Hengshi are being ambushed. Chinese reinforcements have arrived, and a major battle is about to unfold. Part of the invading Japanese army in Wengyuan was severely attacked at Xinjiang and retreated in disarray towards Wengyuan, not daring to penetrate further. There are no Japanese troops north and south of Yingde. The Japanese troops detouring to Hetou are also being intercepted. The offensive has been thwarted. (3rd special dispatch)

Chongqing – According to opinions here, the Japanese army advancing north along the Yuehan Railway will not be able to continue advancing because the Chinese side's fresh troops have now arrived at the front line. The Japanese army took advantage of the Chinese army's reorganization of its lines to launch an offensive. Therefore, the Japanese army east of the Yuehan Railway, having broken through the Chinese army's lines north of Conghua, was able to advance north in order to flank the Chinese army defending the railway at Yingde and to advance on Shaoguan from the southeast. Now that the Chinese side's fresh troops have arrived, they will definitely be able to strengthen the lines southeast of Shaoguan. The Chinese army's senior commander is currently personally commanding the battle at the front to stop the Japanese army's northward advance. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

Meixian – A part of the Japanese army in Chao'an, with several artillery pieces, attacked Wuyu and Fengxi in the morning of the 2nd in multiple columns.

They are currently still being pursued. (4th dispatch)

Editorial

### The First Act of the International Movement at the Beginning of the Year

As is customary at the beginning of each year, this newspaper suspends publication for three days. Today, we resume meeting with our readers. During the suspension, this newspaper prepared to report to readers at any time should major news occur at home or abroad. However, no unexpected events occurred in the past three days. In the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese army has been active on all fronts and has achieved results, with the great victory in northern Guangdong being the most notable. In the Finnish-Soviet War, Finland is resisting the enemy army with all its might. The British-French-German War remains stalemated and quiet. Commodity prices in Shanghai remain at the high levels of autumn and winter, but fortunately, there has been no further increase. The political turmoil in Japan has not subsided, but the Abe Cabinet has shown a stubborn struggle. The situation on all sides in the past few days has been generally like this, and none of it is unexpected. This newspaper will provide a separate summary of these events in today's news section, so I will not repeat them here. Three days ago, this newspaper's New Year's Day editorial pointed out that the United States is of great importance and is the first program scheduled for 1940, which the world wants to see. Now, the first program has begun its initial prelude as scheduled.

The United States Senate and House of Representatives held a joint meeting on the 3rd, marking the beginning of the third session of the 176th Congress of the United States. President Roosevelt personally delivered a speech. The fundamental national policy of a democratic country, both domestic and foreign, is dominated by the parliament; the policy of each era of the United States government is outlined by the president's formal address to the parliament. The meaning of Roosevelt's speech this time is extremely grand and far-reaching; although he did not make specific suggestions on how the United States government will act in various aspects of domestic and foreign affairs, it is clear that he will take positive action internationally. Analyzing his speech, the main points are three: Distinguish that neutrality is not isolation, saying that the United States will never send its young people to the battlefield, that is, it will not participate in the war, this is called neutrality; however, it should not be mistaken that the wars of other countries have nothing to do with the United States and ignore them; this statement is the United States' basic attitude towards international turmoil, one. Saying that if the rest of the world is dominated by force: if small and weak countries lose their independence due to the violence of strong neighbors; if most of humanity is forced to submit to militarism and is not allowed to respect God and adhere to the truth; if world trade is transferred according to the control of force; if the daily news of various countries is blocked; then the United States will not only fail to rely on its strength to be self-sufficient and maintain its current leisurely life, but also make it possible for future generations of the United States to be reduced to slaves; this statement is the United States' basic understanding of international turmoil, two. Saying that the United States can at least do its best, together with other countries, to encourage all behaviors that can reduce the suffering of the world, as well as peace that is beneficial to the United States; saying that the people of all countries have the right to choose their own political system based on the universally recognized principles of freedom; saying that the United States must use its power to open up the world's trade routes; must unite and maintain the light of human freedom, reason and justice; and must strive to rebuild world peace, this statement is the United States' basic orientation towards international turmoil, three. In addition to the three, speaking of specific issues: one is that in order to prevent the failure to promote world peace, it is necessary to increase donations and taxes to cope with emergency national defense expenditures; the second is that we firmly believe that commercial agreements with various countries will help establish stable and lasting peace.

From the above, Roosevelt did not initially explain how the United States would handle each current problem, but if we try to apply the above-mentioned policy basis to problems of various natures, it is not difficult to deduce the direction of American action. For example, the US-Japan commercial treaty will expire in only three weeks; weighing it with the basic understanding and basic orientation declared by Roosevelt, it can at least be asserted that for the sake of the United States, for the sake of future generations, it will never tolerate the phenomenon created by force and compromise with violence, and it will attach importance to commercial treaties as a tool for finding freedom and justice, and will exert them as much as possible. The agenda of the US Congress will begin on the 10th of this month, and at that time, it will be clearly seen that what is gradually developing specifically includes the bill on the president's privilege to conclude commercial treaties with other countries, and the ban on the export of munitions, steel and other metal products to Japan.

Mr. Kerr's plane circled in the air for two hours and could not descend. Later, because the fog at the airport outside Chongqing was thinner, and because the plane's gasoline was about to run out, it was forced to land. Before Mr. Kerr's plane landed, the personnel in the British Embassy and the representatives of the British expatriates here, and the representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the China Boxer Indemnity Committee who were waiting at the airport, were very worried about the safety of the British Ambassador.

### Sun Ke Discusses the Soviet-Finnish War

Chongqing – Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, who recently returned from a tour of Europe and the United States, delivered a speech on December 23. Chinese newspapers have been publishing the full text of the speech daily, stating briefly that the cause of the Soviet-Finnish War was the Soviet Union's fear that Germany would use Finland to attack, rather than Finland directly threatening Leningrad. The Soviet Union, fearing that Germany would attack through Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Finland, concluded non-aggression treaties with the Baltic states. The Soviet-Finnish War was "unnecessary" because although Finland was used by some powers, it would ultimately not attack the Soviet Union. Since the Soviet-Finnish War was launched by the Soviet Union "for its own security," it is different from other wars. He believes that the Soviet-Finnish War will end soon, and Finland will continue to exist as an independent country. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

### US Congress Opens; President Roosevelt Delivers Address; Willing to Work for World Peace; Strongly Condemns Aggressive Countries Infringing on Weak and Destroying Civilization; US Cannot Enjoy Security Alone; Must Use Influence to Open World Trade

Washington: The US Congress opened yesterday. In his opening address, President Roosevelt addressed both domestic and international situations, stating that the US must work hard to prevent the crushing of world peace. The struggle of social and economic forces results in revolution, dictatorship, and war. Today's world has become an extremely chaotic world. Working for world peace is the responsibility of every American. We must not allow this world to regress to the phenomena of the 17th or 18th centuries. The US government's governance in the past year is worth mentioning in two points: (1) The success of the US's good neighbor policy with Central and South America is unprecedented. (2) World public opinion generally recognizes that the US will work hard for world peace. From a military perspective, the US will never be drawn into the European war because the US will never send troops to Europe to fight. The President then reported on US domestic affairs, stating briefly that, apart from defense expenditures, all other government expenditures have been reduced this year, and federal tax revenues have also decreased. If commerce and industry can maintain this state this year, the situation next year will be even better. According to last year's statistics, national production has recovered to the state of 1929. (Joint Press dispatch of [date])

Washington: In his speech, President Roosevelt referred to his previous warning that the daily lives of Americans would feel the shocks of overseas events, saying that this warning was not theoretical because the facts of yesterday and today have clearly confirmed it. The President also stated that the people of the country must not hold the belief that even if human civilization, commerce, and culture are destroyed elsewhere in the world, the United States, as a self-sufficient country, can still live leisurely, safely, and without disturbance. The majority of the American people have not abandoned the hope that the United States will not participate in the war in the slightest, but there is a great difference between not participating in the war and thinking that the war has nothing to do with oneself. We certainly do not need to enter the war, but we can at least work with other countries to encourage actions that can reduce the suffering of the world and also benefit the peace of the United States. We must look to the future and ask our children to consider the possibility of the world being dominated by pure force. If all small countries lose their independence, or if all small countries become mere appendages of strong military systems, or if a large part of the world is forced to worship military leaders as sacred, or is not allowed to serve God but must adhere to the truth, then what impact will this have on the future of our United States? This is also something we must consider. If world trade and its control are in the hands of one country or one group, and this control is established by force, then we must also consider the impact this will have on the future. The people of other countries have the right to choose their own political system, but this right of choice should be based on a certain kind of freedom that they recognize as necessary in all parts of the world. The United States must use its influence to open up the channels of world trade so that countries are not forced to seek by force what could originally be obtained through peaceful conferences. When world peace is expected to be restored, the United States will definitely be able to take a leading position. At present, the United States must prepare itself carefully to prevent the world from achieving peace. Therefore, he asked Congress to pass the proposed continued taxation to meet the emergency national defense expenses. The President concluded by saying, "We must, as a united people, maintain the flame of human freedom, reason, democracy, and justice. Will 1940 be regarded by future generations as another year in which democracy proved that it is indeed the best political system for mankind and worthy of existence? This is what I pray for."

New York: The entire country expressed its agreement with President Roosevelt's address to Congress yesterday, in which he explained the attitude of the United States. According to a famous commentator, Europe can deduce four conclusions from President Roosevelt's speech: (1) The US government does not believe that the US has the possibility of participating in the war by force. (2) The US government is now paying more attention to promoting peace in the form of assistance. (3) The US government's concept of peace is not an immediate compromise solution, but a peace of democratic ideals, which must allow everyone to enjoy considerable freedom. (4) The US government is quite attentive to promoting the realization of a peace conference. (4th Reuters dispatch)

President's Message to Congress Proposes New Budget

Washington: Congress reconvened today. Among the bills to be discussed during this session, the 1941 budget is the most important. It is reported that its contents show an imbalance between income and expenditure, with a shortfall of approximately $300 million. In order to restore balance, the Senate and House of Representatives will inevitably choose one of the following three paths: (1) Allow the government to exceed the legal maximum of the national debt, which is $450 billion. (2) Pass new taxes. (3) Suggest saving expenditures. According to political figures, national defense expenditures in the next year will definitely increase sharply compared to the past, but Congress will not drastically oppose it and can pass the special budget for other departments. During the discussion, it will inevitably cause heated debate. (Havas dispatch of the 3rd)

Washington: US President Roosevelt today submitted to Congress the budget for the next fiscal year, totaling $8,424,000,000. At the same time, for the purpose of expanding the national defense program, the President requested an increase in new taxes of $460,000,000. If this new tax is passed, the treasury deficit can be reduced to $1,716,000,000; otherwise, the treasury will be short $2,176,000,000. In his message, the President stated that he hopes the new taxes increased by Congress can conform to the people's ability to pay and avoid weakening consumer purchasing power. The President also predicted that the economy will definitely improve, but the government's national use plan cannot be stopped midway. (Joint Press dispatch of the 4th)

Please Grant President Special Power to Requisition National Resources

Washington: US Secretary of the Navy Edison has recently requested that Congress grant the President the special power to requisition ships, raw materials, factories, and take other appropriate steps in the event of a national emergency. Edison stated that this proposal is a precautionary measure. Edison wrote to Congress that in March 1917, one month before the United States entered the Great War, Congress had granted President Wilson the same special power. Today he has this proposal not as a prelude to the United States' involvement in the European war. (Reuters dispatch of the 3rd)

How to Sanction Japan Requires Careful Consideration

Washington: The US Congress will convene tomorrow. At that time, it may discuss the US's foreign policy towards Europe, the East, and South American countries. Since the outbreak of the European war, there have been new changes in the US's international relations. The US-Japan Commercial Treaty is about to expire, and the US's preferential treatment for Japanese goods is about to end. Afterwards, whether the US will use its greater freedom to insist on its open-door policy in China, or whether it will take a policy of遏阻 [not sure about the correct term here, it means to contain/restrain] Japan's war against China, Congress will have a thorough consideration. In short, after the expiration of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty, the US has acquired a new weapon against Japan. As for how to use this new weapon, it remains to be discussed by Congress. (Joint Press dispatch of the 2nd)

Washington: According to general predictions, there will be no surprising new developments in the next Congress. The main point of contention seems to be whether to continue the government's reciprocal trade program, which expires on July 12. The Neutrality Act will not undergo any changes, except for special provisions for Japan. This Congress will be a mechanism for several open or secret presidential candidates to gauge public opinion. As for President Roosevelt himself, he has not yet announced whether he is willing to run for a third term as president. (Reuters dispatch of the 2nd)

Washington: Washington's "News Bulletin" stated today that the main enemy of the United States is Japan, because Japan's warlords have made it their mission to drive white people out of Asia. The newspaper also advocated applying pressure to Japan after the US-Japan Commercial Treaty expires this month. The "Baltimore Sun" stated that Japan's war against China has been intermittent in the last twelve months, and has achieved nothing. Tokyo's current actions are nothing more than to save face and avoid the continuation of a large-scale war. (Joint Press dispatch of the 3rd)

### US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Agenda; Work to Begin Next Wednesday; Pittman to Propose Embargo

### Foreign Minister Wang Broadcasts to America

Chongqing: This morning, Chinese Foreign Minister Dr. Wang Chonghui gave a New Year's broadcast address to the United States, praising the United States' announcement of the abrogation of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty, stating briefly that this treaty is about to expire in the first month, so the first month has a special significance for China. The United States' abrogation of this treaty is clearly a correct action. The United States' action clearly demonstrates the implementation of its Far East policy, for from the very beginning of the relationship between China and the United States, its politicians have advocated implementing the open-door policy for China, which was about to be divided by the great powers. Dr. Wang praised President Roosevelt's speech in October 1937, saying, "The current reign of terror and the international state of lawlessness are all caused by a few countries that destroyed international treaties and occupied other people's lands years ago." Wang also praised US Ambassador to Japan Grew's speech in Tokyo last year. Finally, Wang stated, "The fate of the Far East has been shaped by your country's material and spiritual strength. I firmly believe that its future fate will continue to be influenced by your country's material and spiritual strength." (Joint Press dispatch of the 2nd)

### New US Secretary of the Navy Talks About Accelerating Shipbuilding Program; Will Use New Scientific Gains to Actively Build Sea Warfare Weapons

Washington: US Acting Secretary of the Navy Edison was sworn in yesterday as the 46th Secretary of the Navy of the United States before senior naval and army officers, with Judge Advocate General of the Navy Rear Admiral Woodson presiding over the oath.

Washington: According to Edison, the Navy's shipbuilding program is proceeding ahead of schedule in some areas, and there is no delay in other parts. However, in order to accelerate the shipbuilding program in particular, the consent of Congress is required first. According to Edison, the Navy is currently collecting materials and studying the issue of whether it is appropriate to build 80,000-ton super-battleships at the request of Congress. However, at present, no conclusions can be drawn on this issue. Edison also stated that he will promote scientific research on new weapons and new warships, and will use the new scientific gains of various countries in order to gather the strengths of all parties. However, to date, even during the current European war, no brand-new weapons that are different from the past have appeared. The Navy also plans to develop a high-speed torpedo boat and a speedboat to chase submarines. It is now planned to build a fleet of these small ships first. If the results are considerable, then large-scale manufacturing will be carried out. According to Chief of Naval Operations Stark, the Navy will ask Congress to consider accelerating the Navy's shipbuilding program, because under the current circumstances, it is most beneficial to build more ships that have already been approved. (Joint Press dispatch of the 3rd)

Washington: The Navy's new 35,000-ton battleship "North Carolina" is about to be completed and is scheduled to be launched in June of this year. According to Navy authorities, the United States also has six battleships under construction. Their tonnage and armament configuration will be the same as the "North Carolina." According to informed sources, these battleships will be equipped with at least six 16-inch caliber guns, and the cost of each ship will be between 60 million and 70 million US dollars. In addition to the first "North Carolina" being completed soon, the second "Washington" can also be launched in September of this year. (Havas dispatch of the 3rd)

In 1938, Japan purchased 1,381,801 tons of scrap iron in the United States. However, in the first eleven months of 1939, Japan purchased as much as 1,898,742 tons of scrap iron in the United States. Finally, Japan's increased purchases of US scrap iron began after the outbreak of the European war last year, that is, after September of last year. During this period, Japan purchased an average of 202,000 tons of scrap iron in the United States per month. (Joint Press dispatch of the 2nd)

### Japanese Political Situation Unstable; Domestic Public Opinion Dissatisfied with Government

Tokyo: When the Diet met this afternoon, members of various political parties did not discuss cabinet affairs and did not pass a formal resolution of no confidence in the government. However, the newspapers here continue to comment on this matter. The "Kokumin Shimbun" stated that political unrest has increased with the New Year. The resolutions of the members of the various political parties are nothing more than a reflection and call of the general public opinion of the country. Even if the cabinet is thoroughly reorganized, it may not be able to win full approval. At present, the need to consolidate the political situation is extremely urgent, especially in view of the imminent establishment of the new regime in China. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated that every citizen cannot help but talk about the seriousness of the domestic and foreign situation in Japan. Most of this phenomenon is caused by improper government measures. The "Miyako Shimbun" also stated that the voice of the country demanding that the government take responsibility seriously is now increasing day by day. (Reuters dispatch of the 4th)

Tokyo: Minister of the Army Shunroku Hata issued a New Year's message to the nation yesterday, stating that a "new central government" in China can be established soon, but this does not necessarily mean that the China Incident will be resolved soon. The people still need to continue to cooperate to establish a "new order in East Asia." Now that the European situation is becoming increasingly complex and serious, Japan must make all possible preparations to cope with this situation. The Japanese Army is determined to fulfill its mission of resolving the China Incident and coping with the world situation. (Reuters dispatch of the 3rd)

### Soviet Offensive Halted; Mannerheim Line Remains Stable; Finnish War Report Claims Continued Victory; Soviet War Report Claims Front Line Quiet

Helsinki. The Finnish side announced last night that it continued to achieve victories. After the Soviets bombarded Taipale, they launched an infantry assault, but were repelled by the Finnish forces in Helsinki and suffered heavy losses. Finnish troops in Aittojoki annihilated a Soviet company equipped with machine guns. Near Rasti on the Salla-Sammatti front, Finnish troops destroyed five Soviet tanks and two armored vehicles. The Finnish forces in the Kenttäsläntä area are continuing to advance towards the left bank of the Kokkojärvi River. Åbo, a key Finnish [city], was bombed by Soviet aircraft again yesterday. (Reuters, 4th)

Helsinki. According to recent military reports, although localized battles are still raging, the Soviet army has not launched a large-scale attack on the Mannerheim Line. Soviet prisoners of war said that a large number of newly transferred reserves have joined the war. This statement is considered reliable, as evidenced by the younger age and heavier clothing of the Soviet soldiers killed or captured. The temperature at the Petrozavodsk position is currently about forty degrees below zero, making military progress difficult. The Kangasjärvi area is still held by the Finnish army. The Soviet army suffered losses there at the end of last week. Last night's communiqué stated that although January 2nd was quieter in the Karelian Isthmus, there was fighting at several points north of Lake Ladoga. Finnish forces are currently improving their positions. A Soviet attack on the Lake Läväjärvi front was repulsed throughout the day. The Soviet battleship "October Revolution" bombarded the Koivisto battery, but without effect. Soviet aircraft again bombed Åbo and Vartiovuori. The Finnish side shot down seven enemy planes that day. (Reuters, 3rd)

Helsinki. Today's report from the Petsamo front stated that several Finnish bombers bombed the Arctic port of Liinahamari (Liinahamari Port) with success and returned. The port was occupied by the Soviet army at the beginning of the Soviet-Finnish War. Because it does not freeze in winter, it is very important for Soviet shipping and the transport of military supplies. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)

Helsinki. Soviet and Finnish forces continue to fight in the central part of the eastern front, northeast of Suomussalmi. Finnish reports state that neither side is currently using heavy artillery bombardment. Machine guns and hand grenades are the main weapons. Finnish forces are advancing near Kokkojärvi and Kiantajärvi. Several points on the Murmansk Railway have been bombed. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)

Stockholm. Regarding the situation of the war between Finland and the Soviet Union, the "Social Democratic Newspaper" here recently received a telegram from a correspondent stationed in Finland stating that two divisions of the Red Army have been surrounded by Finnish troops in the Aglajärvi area. The communication lines between that area and the supply bases have also been cut off, and their situation seems extremely precarious. The number of soldiers killed and wounded is far greater than that of the Finnish army. Taking the battle of Suomussalmi town in the Kallela area as an example, the Finnish army only suffered about one hundred officers and soldiers killed or wounded, while the Red Army suffered as many as one thousand. (Havas, 4th)

Helsinki. The Soviet army's fierce attack on the Mannerheim Line yesterday is expected to develop further today and become more intense. The Soviet army has been bombarding the Finnish positions with exceptionally fierce artillery fire for 36 hours, and is attempting to break through the line at several key points with concentrated forces. It is believed that the Soviet army, which has been reorganized and is commanded by General Stern, has at least 200,000 men in the area. It is heard daily that another 50,000 men will be dispatched from Leningrad to the area. Approximately one-third of the total Finnish force of 300,000 men is now in the Karelian Isthmus. All sources say that the Finns have not lightly abandoned an inch of land, but it is heard that they are currently building two auxiliary defense lines behind the Mannerheim Line to prevent the Soviet army from breaking through. The Finnish heavy artillery unit in the Karelian Isthmus fired a salvo of twenty-four rounds on New Year's Day. The Soviet artillery retaliated fiercely for nine hours, firing forty to fifty rounds per minute. (Reuters, 2nd)

Vyborg. A Reuters correspondent near Vitoksin on the eastern side of the Karelian Isthmus has confirmed that the elite troops of Central Russia have now arrived at the Soviet front line facing the Mannerheim Line. These are indeed first-class troops, neatly dressed and equipped with the latest German-style gas masks. (Reuters, 3rd)

Helsinki. According to frontline news, the Soviet army is retreating after suffering defeats on all fronts: (1) In the Suomussalmi area, the Soviet 163rd Division was defeated five days ago and is currently retreating; (2) In the Petsamo area, after Finnish reinforcements arrived, they repelled the Soviet army last night. The weather there is extremely cold, with a temperature of minus forty degrees Celsius at 9:00 PM last night; (3) In the Salla area, the Finnish army has also made progress. The Soviet air force was not very active yesterday. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)

Helsinki. The Finnish Air Force has been extremely active in various northern regions in recent days. According to responsible sources, they have shot down no fewer than 150 Soviet aircraft. In addition, the victory of the Finnish army in the town of Suomussalmi in the Karelia area is of great significance. According to Soviet prisoners, the Soviet authorities mobilized a large army to attack the town in two routes, but the Finnish army finally annihilated them after cutting off the Red Army's rear supply. (Havas, 4th)

Stockholm. A large number of Swedish volunteers are currently assisting the Finnish army in fighting on the Finnish front lines. It is learned that the commander of the volunteer army, General Linder, will depart for the army's defense area in Finland within this week to command operations, accompanied by Chief of Staff Lieutenant Colonel Ehrensvärd. (Havas, 4th)

Moscow. The Leningrad Military District Command recently issued a war report stating, "Yesterday, the Finnish front line was quiet and uneventful. Our air force did not conduct reconnaissance flights due to the bad weather." (Havas, 3rd)

Helsinki. According to news from here today, the Soviet army on the Lake Laatokka front north of Lake Ladoga repeatedly attacked Finnish positions with the aid of tanks from Monday to Tuesday, but were repelled in all cases. Also, on the Mannerheim Line front, after 36 hours of artillery bombardment, the Soviet army launched an offensive against the Finnish lines. It is heard that the Red Army has concentrated heavy troops and military supplies in this area. The sound of artillery fire could be clearly heard even in the Vyborg area. At a stronghold in the Aittojoki area, a fierce battle took place between Soviet and Finnish forces on Monday, with both sides gaining and losing ground several times. According to unconfirmed reports, there was a heavy snowstorm in Finland yesterday, so many Soviet planes were forced to land. (United Press, 3rd)

Helsinki. The General Headquarters recently issued a war report stating: (1) In the Karelian Isthmus area, the Red Army artillery units were active as usual, especially in the Taipale River area, where the artillery fire was most intense. From this morning until 1:00 PM, the artillery fire was incessant. Subsequently, under the cover of artillery fire, they launched a major counterattack, but were repulsed after our army's heroic resistance, and the Red Army suffered heavy losses. (2) On the north side of Lake Laatokka, our army launched an offensive, and a Red Army unit was almost completely annihilated in the town of Itäjoki. Although the Red Army launched a counterattack, it was repulsed by our army. (3) In the eastern Suomussalmi district, our army destroyed five Soviet tanks and two armored vehicles in the town of Raate. (4) Soviet aircraft were active as usual, but made no significant achievements. However, it has been confirmed that three were shot down by our army yesterday. (Havas Telegraph, 3rd)

Finnish Military Situation: Improved

Helsinki. Today, the Finnish military situation can be said to be the most optimistic day since the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish War. Of the twelve routes through which the Soviet army invaded Finland, from Lake Laatokka to the Arctic Ocean, five have been completely defeated by the Finnish army. The number of Soviet soldiers killed is in the thousands, and the abandoned military supplies are countless. At the same time, because the caliber of the Finnish artillery is the same as that of the Soviet army, almost all of these shells can be used. The route that penetrated deep into Finland, hoping to divide Finland into two, has completely failed, so this Soviet plan cannot be implemented for the time being. The route south of Lake Laatokka has been crushed by Finnish resistance. In the Petsamo area, the Finnish army has already gained the initiative. On the Mannerheim Line, the Soviet army originally planned to fight a decisive battle here, but is still blocked by the strong fortifications of this line. North of Taipale and north of Koivisto, the Finnish artillery batteries have not been moved an iota, no matter how intensely the Soviet planes and heavy artillery have bombed them. However, the Finnish side also admits that the Soviet assault teams are mostly composed of young and excellent soldiers, and have indeed achieved success in combat. Also, one route of the Soviet army that attempted to encircle the rear of the Finnish army in the area north of Lake Laatokka suffered the greatest losses. In total, the Soviet casualties here are no less than one division, and all of their heavy weapons have been captured by the Finnish side. The narrow roads in the forests here are filled with Soviet corpses. (United Press, 3rd)

German Officers Assisting Soviets in Combat

London. The Amsterdam correspondent of the News Chronicle claims that Germany, at the request of Stalin, has sent a military delegation to Leningrad to assist the Soviet Union in fighting Finland. It is said that Stalin requested that German officers who had assisted the Finnish army in the liberation war in 1918 assist the Soviet Union in combat. This German military delegation is composed of this group. It is reported that the German Army Department has encountered great difficulty in persuading these officers, who had fought side by side with General Mannerheim twenty-one years ago, to now turn against him. (Reuters, 3rd)

Soviet Aircraft Ordered Not to Bomb Civilians

People of All Countries Express Support for Finland

Paris. Assistance to Finland from various countries has been increasing recently. According to news from the capital of Switzerland, people from all walks of life in Basel have formed a fundraising committee and have successively donated 100,000 Swiss francs to Finland. According to news from the capital of Denmark, an anonymous person has ordered fifty giant trucks from a car factory, preparing to donate them to Finland. The total cost is about 500,000 kroner (Danish currency). Various circles in Sweden have also advocated providing assistance to Finland, and most workers are also working as usual during the New Year's holidays, so that the wages earned can be donated to that country. In addition, an employee of the US embassy in Latvia said that the United States can supply Finland with 400 aircraft and 400 volunteer pilots by the end of this month. (Havas, 4th)

Soviet Train Derails

Danzig. The National Daily reports that, according to news from the capital of Sweden, a Soviet train derailed on the Murmansk Railway, resulting in many deaths. It is still unknown whether this was due to a sabotage conspiracy or the actions of a Finnish commando. (Reuters, 3rd)

General Stern Arrives at the Front Line

Stockholm. According to a message received by "Aftonbladet" from Moscow, Soviet General Stern has arrived in the Karelian Isthmus, bringing with him a large number of political police. (Haitong, 3rd)

### Finnish Air Force Bombs Ösel Island; Led by Italian Aircraft

Helsinki. Yesterday, an Italian volunteer aviator led Finnish bombers in an attack on Ösel Island in Estonia, using an Italian Savoia-style aircraft. It is believed that the island is located at the entrance to the Gulf of Riga, and the Soviet Union is currently using it as an air base to attack the west coast of Finland. The Finnish aircraft flew over Ösel at an altitude of several hundred feet, dropping bombs, and fires broke out in several places. Then they turned back, flew lower, and opened fire with machine guns on Soviet troops putting out the fires. The Finnish aircraft encountered anti-aircraft fire, but all returned safely. Later, a Finnish reconnaissance plane flew over Ösel and observed that the extent of the damage there was quite significant, and the fire was still burning. Finnish aircraft were also quite active over Murmansk. It is heard that they destroyed a large oil depot. The railway line intersection and the storage yard behind the Soviet front line were also bombed by Finnish aircraft. Finnish Air Force personnel dropped a large number of bombs on the Utria area because the Soviet army had built a railway from that area to Suomussalmi. It is heard that the railway was severely damaged and is no longer usable. This is one of the reasons why the reserves could not arrive to aid the Soviet army when the Suomussalmi Soviet troops were surrounded. It is rumored that in the Battle of Suomussalmi, the Finnish army did not have any artillery units, and almost completely relied on skirmishing actions to defeat a large number of Soviet troops. The steps taken were to first destroy the field kitchens, then various military supplies, and finally launch an attack on the Soviet troops, who were almost starving. (Reuters, 4th)

### Finnish President Appeals for Allied Assistance

Helsinki. Finnish President Kallio delivered a New Year's broadcast speech today, expressing gratitude for the assistance from other countries and appealing to all countries to continue to provide Finland with active assistance. Kallio concluded by mentioning the war between Britain, France, and Germany, expressing the hope that the war would end soon and peace would be restored. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Germany States Strict Neutrality on Soviet-Finnish War; If Britain and France Want to Establish Bases in Northern Europe, Germany Will Not Stand Idly By; Rumor that Molotov Will Reciprocate a Visit to Berlin

Berlin. A German Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a statement yesterday, declaring that Germany attaches great importance to the plan of Britain and France to establish bases in Northern Europe, and that if it is realized, Germany will not stand idly by. The spokesman continued, "We maintain the strictest neutrality on the Finnish conflict, neither supporting any side, nor have the belligerents requested our assistance." (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Bern. According to Berlin news, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov may travel to Berlin in the near future to reciprocate a visit. Although well-informed sources in Berlin said that this matter is a natural result of close cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union, in the eyes of foreign observers, Germany and the Soviet Union may use the fact that Britain and France violated neutrality in assisting Finland as an excuse to further cooperate in Northern Europe. Regarding this matter, the German side believes that if Britain and France supply Finland with new-style weapons, it will be sufficient to prove that these countries intend to organize a new front line in Northern Europe, and Germany may therefore request Norway and Sweden to allow it to establish military bases on the coasts of those countries as a countermeasure against Britain and France. (Havas, 3rd)

Copenhagen. According to a Berlin correspondent for the "Berlingske Tidende," Germany recently issued a diplomatic note warning Sweden that Germany can no longer tolerate any assistance to Finland from the Western powers. The Germans cannot tolerate British aid to Finland because the purpose of British aid to Finland is to establish naval and air bases in the Nordic countries, from which they can attack Germany and the Soviet Union. The correspondent continued, "German officials are currently watching the steps taken by Britain and France, believing that the Finnish issue is related to Germany and the Nordic countries. The result of Britain's active aid to Finland will cause Germany to reconsider its attitude towards Norway and Sweden." (Reuters, 3rd)

### German-Turkish Economic Agreement to Be Signed

Istanbul. According to well-informed sources here, a German-Turkish economic agreement will be signed in the near future. It is said that the agreement stipulates that the two countries will exchange goods with a value of 16,000,000 Turkish pounds each. Turkey hopes to import machinery and chemicals from Germany, and export raw materials such as tobacco to Germany. After the new agreement is signed, Turkey will be able to import 6,000,000 Turkish pounds of German goods, which have already been transported to Turkish customs or ports in Bulgaria. The remaining 10,000,000 Turkish pounds of goods will be purchased in Germany. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)

### British Convoy System Gradually Showing Results; Three Ships Encountered Disaster in the North Sea on New Year's Day

London. According to responsible sources here, German naval activity decreased significantly last week, and no ships were sunk due to direct actions by German submarines. The German air force also had no activity, so the total tonnage of British ships sunk in this week was only 6,600 tons. As for the effectiveness of the British convoy system, it is even greater. In total, British warships escorted 1,568 ships, and only twelve were sunk by the enemy. (Reuters, 2nd)

London. Three ships encountered disaster in the North Sea on New Year's Day. The London oil tanker "San Tirso," with a displacement of 8,072 tons, was damaged by a mine and ran aground. All forty-one crew members have landed without casualties. Also, the British ship "Box Hill," with a displacement of 5,677 tons, sank after an explosion. Of the thirty-two crew members, twelve have landed at a port on the northeast coast, and one body has been recovered. The remaining nineteen are feared to have perished. According to a report from Haugesund, the Norwegian cargo ship "Rona," with a displacement of 959 tons, also struck a mine and was lost. The crew has been rescued by another Norwegian cargo ship, "Columbia," and taken to Kopervik. (Reuters, 1st)

London. Today, sources here refuted the German claim that over one million tons of Allied and neutral ships have been sunk as untrue. In the first sixteen weeks after the outbreak of the war, the average weekly loss of British ships was 25,500 tons, while the replacement of newly built ships averaged 25,000 tons per week. As of the end of 1939, the total number of ship losses was as follows: 17 naval vessels, including 8 warships, totaling 55,120 tons; 9 chartered ships totaling 190,000 tons; 117 British merchant ships totaling 421,404 tons; 12 French ships totaling 70,101 tons; 81 neutral ships totaling 243,222 tons. (Reuters, 3rd)

Stockholm. It is learned that the Swedish ship "Ottar Trozelli" (1,951 tons) recently sank in the eastern waters of the United Kingdom after hitting a mine. All crew members were rescued by a Norwegian ship. (Havas, 2nd)

### The Sino-Soviet Agreement on the Chinese Eastern Railway and Fishery Issues: Japan Guarantees Payment of Chinese Eastern Railway Debt, Fishery Agreement Extended for One Year

Moscow: Regarding the Japanese payment of the final installment for the Chinese Eastern Railway and Sino-Soviet fishery issues, both parties reached an agreement on December 31, which has been published in local newspapers. According to the first agreement, the Japanese government guarantees that the "Manchukuo" government will pay the final installment for the Chinese Eastern Railway on January 4, 1940, as well as the principal and interest of 7,093,883.55 yen under the "gold currency" arrangement (this interest is calculated at 3% from March 23, 1938, to January 3, 1940, after deducting 1,284,317.74 yen claimed by "Manchukuo" from the Soviet government). The above claims, "Manchukuo's" demands on the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union's demand for "Manchukuo" to pay the retirement benefits of the Chinese Eastern Railway employees, amounting to 590,000 US dollars, have been submitted to the Japanese Foreign Minister, the "Manchukuo" representative in Japan, and the Soviet Ambassador to Japan and trade personnel for careful review. Two-thirds of the funds payable by "Manchukuo" to the Soviet Embassy in Japan will be used to purchase Japanese and Manchurian goods, provided that these goods meet the needs of the Soviet Union and are similar in price and quality to ordinary products. The fishery agreement stipulates that the validity period of the documents signed at the January 23, 1928 fishery conference will be extended to December 31, 1940. These documents will be replaced by a new agreement, and negotiations on the new agreement are underway and will be signed this year. Regarding the extension of the fishery agreement, Molotov has exchanged documents with Togo, so that Japanese citizens can conduct fishing operations in 39 fishing zones, and the Soviet state-owned fishery industry can also obtain the right to catch 5 million "pood" of frogs. All fishing zones whose leases expired in 1939 will be auctioned in 1940. According to past practices, Japanese fishing masters can still purchase bonds of the Kamchatka Joint-Stock Company from the Soviet State Bank, with the price set at 32.5 yuan to purchase bonds worth 100 rubles, and these bonds can be used to pay taxes, etc. If the exchange rate of the yen changes from the New York exchange rate on April 1, 1939, the yen exchange rate for purchasing shares of the Kamchatka Joint-Stock Company must also be changed accordingly, so that the value of the company's bonds remains equal to the price on April 1, 1939. (TASS dispatch, 1st)

Moscow: Regarding the Sino-Soviet agreement on the Chinese Eastern Railway and fishery issues, the newspapers published TASS commentary as follows: "The documents published today are a solid development in resolving various disputes between the Soviet Union and Japan. The conclusion of this agreement is the result of negotiations between Molotov and Togo in November and December 1939. The Deputy Commissioner of the Soviet People's Foreign Affairs Committee also participated in these negotiations. The importance of this agreement can be seen in the scope and nature of the resolution. According to the Chinese Eastern Railway agreement signed by the Soviet Union and 'Manchukuo' on March 23, 1935, the 'Manchukuo' government should have paid the final installment of 5,981,625 yuan on March 23, 1938. A few days before the payment of this amount, the 'Manchukuo' government suddenly raised a counter-claim of 5 million yuan to the Soviet government. The Soviet government pointed out that this counter-claim was completely unfounded and resolutely rejected it. The 'Manchukuo' government insisted on its original demand and refused to pay the final installment. However, according to the Chinese Eastern Railway agreement, the Japanese government was responsible for guaranteeing the payment of this amount. Regarding this responsibility, Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota explained it in an official document on March 23, 1935. In view of the obligation to guarantee the repayment of this amount, the Soviet government notified the Japanese government in November 1938, stating that if the final installment of the Chinese Eastern Railway was not paid, the Soviet side would not start negotiations with the Japanese authorities to sign a long-term fishery agreement. In 1938 and 1939, 'Manchukuo' and its guarantor, the Japanese government, did not pay the final installment. In the autumn of 1939, the Japanese government re-raised the issue of signing a long-term fishery agreement, but the Soviet government still insisted on its original position, stating that if the final installment was not paid, the Soviet side would not conduct negotiations with the Japanese government on the above-mentioned fishery issue. In view of the imminent expiration of the temporary fishery agreement at the end of 1939, the Japanese government suggested extending the agreement for one year. The Soviet side immediately stated that this could be done, but the final installment of the Chinese Eastern Railway must be paid before the agreement was extended. The negotiations on the payment of the final installment of the Chinese Eastern Railway were completed on December 31, 1939. The two parties signed an agreement, whereby the Japanese government guaranteed to the Soviet side that the 'Manchukuo' government would pay the final installment, as well as the principal and interest under the current terms. The so-called gold terms are provisions to avoid the Soviet Union being affected by fluctuations in the yen exchange rate, plus 3% weekly interest from March 23, 1938, until the time of payment. Since the 'Manchu' side had a counter-claim of 1,284,317.74 yen, and the Soviet government also demanded that the 'Manchu' side pay the retirement benefits of the Chinese Eastern Railway employees, amounting to 590,000 US dollars, the two parties, in view of their respective demands, decided to deduct 1,284,317.74 yen from 7,093,883.55 yen. The demands and counter-claims of both parties have been submitted to the Japanese Foreign Minister, the 'Manchu' representative in Japan, and the Soviet Ambassador to Japan and trade personnel for joint review. Therefore, we can consider that the issue of the final installment of the Chinese Eastern Railway has been resolved, and at the same time, we hope that all disputes regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway can be resolved accordingly. After the conclusion of the Chinese Eastern Railway negotiations, the situation of the fishery negotiations improved. The Soviet government not only expressed its willingness to extend the agreement for one year, but also prepared to conclude a long-term fishery agreement with the Japanese side. In addition, the two parties have also decided to extend the various special regulations for the 39 fishing zones for one year. The principle of auctioning off the areas whose lease terms expired in 1939 has also been confirmed. In addition, a stable payment method has been stipulated, so that the Soviet Union will not be affected by fluctuations in world exchange rates. The extension of the Sino-Soviet fishery agreement for one year, and the preparation for negotiating a longer-term agreement, all indicate the solid development of Sino-Soviet economic relations. The conditions for those engaged in river and sea fishing in the Soviet Union to carry out normal work are: (1) complying with the agreement; (2) obeying Soviet laws and various fishing regulations. (TASS dispatch, 1st)

Washington: After the Soviet Union and Japan signed a temporary agreement extending the current fishery agreement, official circles here, not yet knowing the details, declined to express their opinions. Diplomatic circles were neither surprised nor worried, and generally believed that this agreement only had local significance, and it was unclear how the two countries would negotiate and sign a formal agreement in the future. The resolution of the Chinese Eastern Railway issue was also not very significant. Generally, the Soviet Union wants to ease relations with Japan in the Far East so that it can act freely in Europe. Japan, on the other hand, wants to use the Sino-Soviet agreement as propaganda material to urge the United States to pursue a policy of appeasement toward Japan in China. The reason for the rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Japan is probably this. (Havas, 31st)

Chongqing: The Central Daily News here today criticized the renewed fishery agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union for one year, believing that this move by Japan was clear evidence of its further kneeling to the Soviet Union, because Japan's obtaining this temporary agreement was entirely due to its agreement to pay the last batch of funds for the Chinese Eastern Railway. Looking at the general issues between Japan and the Soviet Union, the conclusion of this temporary agreement is actually insignificant, and there are actually many difficulties ahead for the true improvement of relations between the two countries.

### Intense Explosion Heard in Beiping

Beiping: A violent explosion occurred near Beiping yesterday, shaking the city and causing panic among residents. One theory is that two Chinese bombers flew to Fengtai, a few miles southwest of Beiping, and dropped bombs, hitting an ammunition depot and causing three terrifying explosions. This theory has not yet been confirmed, but it is certain that a certain foreigner planned to take a train to Fengtai this morning but was stopped by the police and not allowed to go. Before the explosion, a large number of Japanese planes were seen flying over the city. Some Japanese said, "The Japanese planes are practicing bombing, hence the explosion." However, it is rare to hear such a major explosion not far from the city. It is rumored that there has been fighting near the East Gate recently, but a Japanese spokesman said that he had not heard of this matter. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

### Military Commission Releases Weekly Battle Report: December 29 to January 4

Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Commission said that in the past week (December 29 to January 4), the fighting was most intense in the southern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. Fierce battles also took place on the other fronts. The Chinese army bravely fought the Japanese and has achieved a great victory. In addition to what has been published in recent days, the following is a summary of the important combat results on the northern and southern battlefields:

Southern Section of Guangdong-Hankou Railway: Since the Japanese invaded northward in multiple routes last week, after being severely attacked by the Chinese army on the south bank of the Pearl River, near Conghua, and in the area of Zuotanxu, the Japanese continued to reinforce their forces this week and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese. The left wing advanced towards Yingde, while the central and right wings advanced towards Wengyuan, all aiming to converge and attack Qujiang. The Chinese army ambushed troops and attacked from all sides. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the entire Japanese front wavered and collapsed in a rout southward. More than 3,000 Japanese were killed or wounded near Jinzhuyuan and Shatien, more than 2,000 were killed or wounded in the Niubeisji and Lytian areas, and more than 1,000 were killed or wounded near Lianjiangkou and the Pearl River estuary. There were many Japanese corpses and horses left along the way in other places. In particular, a regiment of the Japanese most elite Konoe Division in the central route was completely annihilated in Liang Kou. Hundreds of their tanks and armored vehicles were unable to escape due to being ambushed and were completely burned by the Chinese. Therefore, the Japanese left and right wings were greatly shocked and retreated in a panic. They were again intercepted by the Chinese army and civilians along the way, and countless were killed or wounded, forcing them to Meikeng area, where they were surrounded and annihilated. More than 3,000 Japanese were killed or wounded. In total, more than 10,000 Japanese were killed or wounded. Thousands of steel helmets, firearms, ammunition, and other military supplies were captured.

Southeastern Shanxi: Since the Chinese army captured the two important strongholds of Licheng and Dongyangguan, and once rushed into Changzhi, it continued to launch a fierce attack, and the fighting became more intense. More than 1,500 Japanese were killed in the Huguan, Changzhi, and Sudian areas, and two-thirds of Baodian was recovered. On the morning of the 29th, Lucheng was captured. There are now no Japanese troops in the area near Shexian, Dongyangguan, Licheng, and Lucheng. The Chinese army is now besieging the Japanese in Changzhi. Southern Shanxi: The Chinese army has launched a fierce attack on the Japanese north of Zhongtiao Mountain for several days, successively capturing more than ten strongholds including Weicun, Yangshe, Xibangcun, Peishe, Housan, Zhangguodian, and the areas east of Xipanwucun, killing more than 1,400 Japanese. The Chinese army is now continuing to push towards the triangular area. The Japanese transportation lines have been completely destroyed by the Chinese, and they are extremely panicked.

Southern Henan: The Japanese in Xinyang are still under siege. The important strongholds of Wushan in the southwest of the county seat, Yangfan in the northwest, Huangtuzhai in the western suburbs, and Feijingdian in the northern suburbs have all been decisively captured this week. Another elite force, after recovering Lijiazhai, launched a fierce attack on Wusheng Pass, achieving great gains. The Japanese are trapped in heavy encirclement and are already wavering.

Eastern Henan: The Japanese in Taikang and Huaiyang have repeatedly made trouble in recent days, but have been repelled. A unit of the Chinese army broke into Shangqiu, killing countless Japanese. After Shexian in northern Henan was recovered, the three towns of Yetao, Paihuai, and Wuji were successively captured. The Chinese army is now separately attacking Anyang and Wu'an, making rapid progress. One day and night, a unit of the Chinese army broke into Qinyang, and the street fighting was extremely fierce. The fighting is still ongoing.

Anhui and Jiangxi: The Chinese army in Anhui and Jiangxi has launched a fierce attack on the Japanese in the past week. On the southern Anhui front, more than ten strongholds including Huxingshan, Laohujain, and Qingshan have been successively captured, annihilating many Japanese troops, and sinking three Japanese warships. In the Battle of Boji Mountain, the Japanese battalion commander Goto and two company commanders, Matsushima and Fukuse, and more than 600 others were killed.

In northern Jiangxi, several important places such as Xiangfuguan, Liaojiabian, Baiziqiao, Shizishan, Liaocuntanxi have also been successively recovered, killing more than 2,200 Japanese, capturing more than ten machine guns, more than 600 rifles, and destroying more than 20 Japanese vehicles and burning more than 30 vehicles. Fengxin and Guangyi were once broken into, killing many Japanese.

Hunan-Hubei Border: Important Japanese strongholds such as Tiezhugang, Shimatou, Balipu, Jiangjiaping, Shangtianping, Bajianshan, Qishiling, Zhangjiashan, Tieling, Daqiao, Wulongzui, Dashaping, Wulipai, and Dadikou have all been recovered by the Chinese army. The Japanese casualties were extremely heavy. Intense battles between the Chinese and Japanese armies are still ongoing in the Tongcheng, Linxiang, and Yueyang areas. In central Hubei, the Japanese gathered more than 20,000 troops, dozens of cannons, and more than 100 tanks, and launched a major counterattack against the Chinese army, but they were fiercely repelled by the Chinese. By the evening of the 28th, all the Japanese troops had been defeated, with corpses scattered everywhere. Now Majiaji and Lijia are all reported to be recovered, and the Zhongjing Road has been cut off. In addition, the Chinese army on the Hankou-Yichang Road intercepted and annihilated more than 500 Japanese reinforcements near Yanmenkou, destroying many tanks. In Luoyangdian, Sanyangdian, Wangjialing and other places, the Japanese suffered more than 1,000 casualties under a fierce attack by the Chinese army. In addition, Chahan Temple was recovered in northern Suiyuan, and Sa County was once broken into. Pingtan in Fujian was recovered again.

### Winter Treatments for Neurasthenia, Nocturnal Emission, and Premature Ejaculation

— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Faculty of a Russian Labor University

Generally, neurasthenia, as a condition, progresses from mild to severe. Therefore, one should seek immediate treatment upon noticing it, to restore health. When discussing the distinctions of this ailment, there are no clear boundaries. Those suffering from neurasthenia may also experience nocturnal emissions, spermatorrhea, lower back pain, and other symptoms. These are all due to a lack of self-care or excessive indulgence.

Excessive workload, overexertion, or being subjected to job loss and economic pressure can lead to this. However, if the causes can be eradicated, one can naturally regain health. For instance, someone unemployed for a long time may feel mental relief upon finding a job, and their neurasthenia may be alleviated.

Furthermore, masturbation and promiscuity in youth are major contributing factors to neurasthenia. If left untreated, they lead to nocturnal emissions and premature ejaculation, forming a kidney deficiency. The brain, spinal cord, and sexual organs are all affected, plunging the body and mind into extreme weakness.

Regarding effective treatments for the above symptoms, endocrine therapy is paramount. This involves extracting essence from animal testicles to replenish the human body. This is the most advanced new invention, and it is very simple and effective. Patients can purchase and take the genuine German testicular essence endocrine preparation "Vigorex" for men, three times daily. It indeed possesses the three major efficacies of nourishing the brain, nourishing the blood, and nourishing the kidneys. Especially in winter, the meridians and vessels in our body are in a state of contraction. At this time, timely replenishment is necessary. Moreover, people with weakened constitutions are very afraid of the cold during winter. Once they take "Vigorex," the cells in the body receive replenishment of new essence and blood, the function of metabolism is promoted, and the body can resist the invading cold. The energy consumed daily is also continuously produced, and sexual function becomes abundant. Digestive power is also enhanced. Furthermore, the ingredients of "Vigorex" also contain brain-nourishing phosphorus, so it is most suitable for treating neurasthenia. According to my experience in treating this condition, the yin-nourishing effect appears 24 hours after taking "Vigorex." However, for those who have excessive self-indulgence, nocturnal emissions, or spermatorrhea, they should also take three "Nervine Anti-Emission Tablets" before going to bed for greater effectiveness. "Vigorex" also has a version for women, which is a good medicine for regulating menstruation and promoting fertility. Taking it in winter will accelerate the effectiveness of the medicine.

Gonorrhea Spring and Autumn

### ### An Experimental Discussion on Expelling Gonorrhea

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

Failure is the Mother of Success, Gonorrhea Can Be Cured From Now On

Greatly Different From Ordinary Transmembrane Bactericides

Regarding whether gonorrhea can be completely cured, there is now a correct answer, which I have repeatedly clarified! Although I am an internal medicine doctor, the number of people seeking treatment for gonorrhea exceeds that of other diseases; there are hundreds of people every day. Therefore, in terms of treatment, I have tasted the joys and sorrows of success and failure. Now, I respectfully describe my usual experiences for patients' reference, which I think gonorrhea patients will be happy to hear.

I have used many drugs for the treatment of gonorrhea, but none of them have very outstanding and extraordinary effects. However, the effect of local transmembrane sterilization is very slight, and local washing operations and other treatments are more harmful than beneficial. Therefore, I decided not to use oral medicine, but to use electrotherapy and various surgical treatments. Since the surgery is tied up, it takes a lot of time, and the benefits are limited. However, the patients waiting for the consultation are in a hurry. My heart is even more anxious. Later, Dr. Chen told me that the German "Clinical Medical Journal" contains the results of a drug called "Kollargol," which is unanimously praised by famous scholars from various countries as a great success in treating gonorrhea. Earlier, I was very familiar with "Kollargol" in the United States. Since returning to China, I immediately adopted this medicine. Unexpectedly, after a trial, the effect was immediately apparent, beyond expectations. It turned out that the reason why "Kollargol" was so successful was not accidental. The inventor of this drug, Dr. Peter, a German gonorrhea expert, used a mixture of protein and pigment to make it, because it has the power to kill bacteria, so it has an anti-inflammatory effect. All acute gonorrhea sequelae, complications, continuous gonorrhea system, morning closure, and testicular inflammation, prostatitis, cystitis, etc. can be cured within three or four weeks. Therefore, patients who come to seek medical treatment are prescribed this medicine, and whether it is male or female gonorrhea, it can be completely cured and will never recur.

### Lung Disease and the Phenomenon of Qi Reversal

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

If a patient with lung disease has the phenomenon of qi reversal, then the disease is quite dangerous. There is no doubt that it has entered the third stage of lung disease. Those who cough up blood are even more serious, so the patient must not ignore it. However, according to my experience, as long as the patient can rest quietly, take nutritious food, and add medication treatment, there is no one who does not have the effect of resurrection.

Recently, there was a patient named Zeng Tianyuan, 24 years old, from Wuxi, who had been suffering from lung disease for more than two years. Although he had taken various Chinese and Western medicines, it was completely ineffective. Last autumn, he was introduced by a friend to my clinic for treatment. After X-ray examination, it was found that there were one large and one small cavity in the lungs, and the qi reversal was very severe. There was a lot of night sweats, and the condition was very dangerous. Therefore, he was ordered to take "Pulmotone" and to rest. After three months, the condition had gone more than half, and it was cured after another three months.

### To Cure Nocturnal Emission, You Must Quit Smoking and Drinking

— Dr. Zheng Yan, German Medical Doctor

Patient Zhao Juming, from Wuxi, 22 years old, (self-reported)——Since childhood, his body has been good, he likes sex, loves smoking and drinking, and likes to read obscene books and paintings and spring palace photos, so he commits the bad habit of masturbation. When sexual desire is impulsive, he often plays with sexual organs by hand to achieve the purpose of ejaculation. It has not been interrupted for three or four years, and he likes smoking and drinking, and he must smoke more than two packs of cigarettes a day, and he must be drunk when drinking alcohol. Therefore, his body is greatly damaged. In the past six months, he has had nocturnal emissions, and the number has increased from less to more, from wet dreams to no dreams. Although he is determined to quit, but the habit has become a habit, and he still commits it from time to time. Later, after being treated by a doctor, he took medicine and was ordered to quit smoking and drinking. Within a month, there were no nocturnal emissions. Later, because the smoking addiction broke out, he resumed smoking and drinking. Unexpectedly, nocturnal emissions also followed! Now I see the newspaper! I came here to seek treatment, etc. (Cure process)——Because smoking and alcohol can stimulate nerves, he was ordered to quit completely. In addition, he was ordered to take "Nervine Anti-Emission Tablets" three tablets every night, and German men's "Vigorex." Mr. Zhao followed the words and acted. In two months, his weight increased by 15 pounds, nocturnal emissions have been cured, and his health has been completely restored.

Gonorrhea Lecture

### ### Dangerous Conditions of Untreated Gonorrhea

— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road

Generally, people are confused that after gonorrhea has become chronic, it can be left untreated to some extent, and there is no major harm. Therefore, most gonorrhea patients turn into various difficult-to-treat sequelae or transfer symptoms due to chronicity. The mild ones can live with the disease for many years, and the severe ones are more likely to have life-threatening dangers. Regardless of the severity of chronic gonorrhea symptoms, if you do not seek buttock treatment as soon as possible and pay attention to personal hygiene, the patient's lifelong happiness will be sacrificed by this chronic gonorrhea. The society is also indirectly affected by it. Patients with chronic gonorrhea must pay attention to this.

Generally, after contacting the opposite sex with gonorrhea poison, the symptoms of gonorrhea will appear three times in about a week. The two or three weeks after the onset are called the acute stage. If appropriate treatment can be sought urgently, it is easiest to cure. After this, it enters the chronic stage. The pain of chronic gonorrhea on the surface is not as severe as before, but the actual danger is far greater than during the acute period. If it becomes chronic prostatitis, orchitis, seminal vesiculitis, or seminal duct inflammation, etc., not only will the individual suffer, but they will often be infertile as a result, and the relationship between husband and wife will also go bankrupt as a result!

According to my past experience, the treatment methods and operations for chronic gonorrhea after being untreated are more complicated than in the acute stage. For this disease, I use gonorrhea holy medicine "Kollargol" as an oral medicine to increase the effectiveness of anti-gonorrhea phagocytosis, and use German static electricity therapy to make the bactericidal power directly reach the lesion, and use scientific surgery as an auxiliary, which can complete the task of radical cure in a short period of time, and can absolutely not recur, because the gonococci have been extinct, so there is no need to worry about its resurgence. It also treats syphilis, scrofula, chancroid, and sexual neurasthenia. Clinic hours are from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm every day. 20 people are sent for diagnosis every day, and each person only needs to take a number gold of 5 cents and a copy of "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth 1 yuan.

### New Fourth Army War Achievements: Troop Strength of 100,000 Creates a Formidable Force, Rushing North and South, Repeatedly Achieving Remarkable Exploits

Reports from the mainland state that, according to news from the headquarters of the New Fourth Route Army, although the Japanese army and navy have repeatedly carried out "mopping-up operations," the guerrillas in western Zhejiang still inflicted heavy losses on the invaders last year, seized a large amount of military supplies, and recovered important towns. Some of these towns are still held by the guerrillas. It is understood that the New Fourth Route Army was formed in 1937 and early 1938 from a small number of troops fighting in the areas of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Zhejiang. With the constant arrival of reinforcements from the rear, its strength has increased to about 100,000 men, becoming a formidable force.

Most Active Between Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Xuzhou

In the past year and a half, the army's operations have covered the entire area south of the Yellow River and north of Hangzhou Bay, with several major battles occurring. The most intense activity has been in the area of approximately 35,000 square li between Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Xuzhou. Through frequent surprise attacks, they have caused over 10,000 Japanese soldiers to die in battle in this area. The recapture of Haiyan in Hangzhou Bay is particularly significant. Haiyan has been gained and lost no fewer than six times in the past year, with fierce fighting. The residents of the area call Haiyan "Guerrilla City." From a military standpoint, the encirclement of Hangzhou in October last year was extremely successful. The guerrillas encircling Hangzhou, numbering more than ten routes, maintained close contact with each other despite the lack of transportation. Guerrillas in other parts of the area also achieved similar successes, engaging in approximately 200 fierce battles with the Japanese and puppet troops.

Over Ten Thousand Japanese Soldiers Annihilated and Wounded

The Japanese suffered over ten thousand casualties, and highway traffic was disrupted no fewer than 300 times. Fifty bridges were destroyed, and approximately one hundred armored speedboats and fifty armored vehicles were seized. In early April last year, large guerrilla units approached the cities of Wukang and Wuxing on the southern section of the Nanjing-Hangzhou Highway. The Japanese garrison defended the cities to the death for many days, awaiting reinforcements. Subsequently, the guerrillas repeatedly attacked the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, causing the line to be disrupted no fewer than ten times. During operations against the Japanese along the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border, Commander Xu of the "Maintenance Government Conservative Force" was captured.

War Enters Second Stage

Now, the war has entered its second stage. A group of junior officers, sent to the rear for special training, has returned to the front lines. Others are currently undergoing the same training. The guerrillas have no difficulty obtaining military supplies from their operational bases. At night, the fields and even the highways belong to the guerrillas. The Japanese and puppet troops dare not risk their lives patrolling the areas. The guerrillas obtain ample food from the mountain residents and the residents supply them. Therefore, there is no need to transport food from the bases to the front. Capturing food stored by the Japanese is also very helpful.

### Customs Begins Handling Customs Declaration Registration, Declarations Only Accepted After Re-registration

The General Affairs Department of the Jianghai Customs has issued Notice No. 101 regarding the re-registration of all customs brokers and firms, which has commenced on the 1st of this month. The procedures are as follows: (1) Customs Brokers: All customs brokers should submit their old business licenses to the customs for exchange for new licenses, along with a re-registration fee of two yuan in national currency. If they are members of the Customs Brokers Association, the association should collect and submit the licenses on their behalf. (2) Firms: All firms should submit a separate application to the customs for re-registration. Blank application forms can be obtained from the General Registration Office, but no further endorsements are required. (3) Customs Brokers at the Post Office Parcel Office: All customs brokers at the customs post office parcel office should submit their old business licenses to the customs for exchange for new licenses, along with a re-registration fee of two yuan in national currency and an additional guarantee of 300 yuan in national currency, bringing the total to 600 yuan. This guarantee will be refunded in full one month after the customs broker ceases operations. (Note: Customs brokers who do not wish to continue operations at this time may have their previously registered guarantees refunded immediately. However, new firms registered after January of this year and old firms that have re-registered must wait three months before claiming the guarantee if they wish to cease operations.) If re-registration is not completed according to the above procedures by February 1st, it will be considered unregistered. All declarations will only be accepted after complete re-registration.

### U.S. Consulate Lodges Protest, Japanese Consulate Replies, Investigation Continues into Beating of American Woman

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that the Japanese Consulate has replied to the protest lodged by the U.S. Consulate regarding the beating of American citizen Miss Donaldson by Japanese soldiers, stating that the case is currently under investigation to uncover the truth. Miss Donaldson initially reported to the U.S. authorities on December 28th that she was subjected to rough treatment by a Japanese soldier at the western end of the Sichuan Road bridge on December 20th. She delayed reporting to the U.S. Consulate for several days because she was busy purchasing items for the upcoming Christmas holiday. The U.S. authorities lodged a protest with the Japanese Consulate on December 28th, requesting an investigation into the matter. A Japanese naval spokesman subsequently denied the incident at a press conference, stating that Miss Donaldson delayed reporting the incident for too long, so there are "some questionable aspects" to her allegations.

### Committee Member of the Special Municipal Federation Suggests Group Purchase and Transport of Coal

Yesterday, committee members Zhang Yizhai, Liu Zhongying, and Ge Futian of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation jointly submitted a suggestion stating: "Respected Sirs, prices in Shanghai are exorbitant, and the people's livelihood is difficult. The price of rice is capped at 40 yuan per shi, and coal is over 90 yuan per ton, setting unprecedented records. Both rice and coal are necessities for the people's daily life. Since the price of coal has risen, the water company, electricity company, and stove vendors have all raised prices several times. Coal balls, which used to cost 70-80 cents per dan before the war, now cost 4 yuan per dan. The people's suffering has reached an extreme. The reason for the soaring coal prices is that the source of domestic coal has been cut off since the end of the war, and the shipment of Kailuan coal to Shanghai is also restricted. Furthermore, ordering foreign coal is affected by exchange rates. Conversely, the population of Shanghai is concentrated, and demand has increased dramatically. The imbalance between supply and demand is the real reason for the soaring coal prices. However, the purchase and transportation of coal in Shanghai have always been in the hands of a few coal merchants. If, in this extraordinary period, we can concentrate the users of factories and other industries and implement group purchase and transportation, the source will be unblocked, and the inventory will be thicker, and the price of coal will surely relax. At the same time, we have heard that the wholesale price of Kailuan coal is currently only around 40 yuan, while users have to pay more than 90 yuan, and there is no shortage of speculation and manipulation in between. The rice and grain problem has already been addressed by various elites, who have organized a People's Food Regulation Association to carry out regulation. Coal is as important to the people's livelihood as rice and grain. Therefore, we hereby submit this special letter suggesting that you quickly discuss and implement group purchase and transportation to unblock the source, and strictly set price limits to prevent manipulation, in order to stabilize the people's livelihood and maintain order. We earnestly pray for this."

### Changshu Under Lockdown, Japanese Army Attacked, Massive Search Launched

According to people coming to Shanghai from Changshu, the Japanese army in Changshu was suddenly attacked by Chinese guerrillas at dawn on New Year's Day, resulting in dozens of deaths and injuries. The guerrillas scattered after the attack. The Japanese army was caught off guard and suffered heavy casualties. Subsequently, starting at 7:00 AM on New Year's Day, they closed the four city gates and launched a massive search that has lasted for four days without any results. Because the city gates are tightly closed, the situation inside the city cannot be accurately known. When the city was closed, many residents inside and outside the city were separated. Those without relatives or friends to turn to could only weep by the door. From 6:00 AM to 7:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd, the southeast two gates were opened for one hour to rescue these separated people, but all were subjected to naked body searches. According to sources, a large number of slogans were found in the city on the morning of New Year's Day, and the Japanese headquarters was also attacked, which is why the city was locked down and a massive search was launched. The Japanese army has now sent the wounded soldiers to Suzhou for treatment, and ordered the puppet "County Magistrate" and "Public Security Bureau Chief" to investigate the people involved in this case. Another group of Japanese soldiers has been dispatched to conduct a household registration check with the police. Therefore, it is not yet certain when the city will be opened. However, the city's residents rely entirely on supplies of food and vegetables from outside the city. Since the city was closed, a serious problem will arise. As for the area outside the city, although business is still open as usual during the day, it closes in the evening, and there are also occasional sporadic gunshots.

### Japanese Arbitrarily Kidnap Chinese, First Tie Them Up and Take Them to Hongkou, Car Driver Beaten

The "North-China Daily News" reports that, according to a report received by the Police Department, at 10:40 AM on December 30th last year, four Japanese or Koreans, accompanied by a Chinese accomplice, entered the residence of a retired Chinese merchant near Fujian Road and Fuzhou Road and searched it, finding a smoking pipe and a small amount of opium. They then dragged the merchant out and forced him into a car belonging to a Japanese automobile company in Hongkou. The car drove across the Sichuan Road bridge and through various roads in Hongkou, arriving at the intersection of Wusong Road and Qiujiang Road, where they paid the car fare and left. The car driver became suspicious of this group and followed them, causing the kidnappers to become displeased. They turned around and beat the driver, then ordered him to leave. The Police Department has launched an investigation.

### Public Concession Unresolved Issues, Such as Outlying Roads and Suzhou Creek North, Difficult to Be Optimistic About Resolution

The "Shanghai Feng Wubao" reports that several unresolved issues in the Public Concession, such as the outlying roads issue, the areas north of Suzhou Creek in the Public Concession, and the restoration of pre-war traffic in these areas, remain unresolved at the beginning of this new year. An official of the Municipal Council told reporters yesterday (the 3rd) that it is difficult to be optimistic about resolving these issues this year and can only hope that these issues can be resolved this year. The Municipal Council, the "Shanghai Municipal Government," and the Japanese authorities have all studied these issues last year, but no solution has yet been agreed upon.

### North China Import and Export Trade Under Strict Control, Implemented in Qingdao, Longkou, Yantai, and Weihaiwei, Tianjin May Not Be an Exception

Since the Sino-Japanese War, North China has been the first to be occupied, and commerce, transportation, etc., are all controlled by the Japanese army. Therefore, not only are the Chinese people not free, but foreign merchants are also subject to considerable threats. Recently, this has become even more severe, with the control of local products exported from North China and goods shipped from other ports all being controlled by the Japanese and puppet regimes. The local products exported must be exchanged for the goods shipped in, and cannot be sold and purchased immediately. Therefore, Chinese and foreign merchants find trade in North China even more difficult. It is understood that ports such as Qingdao, Longkou, Yantai, and Weihaiwei have already implemented this system. Although prices in Tianjin have been controlled, and the exchange of products for exports and imports has not yet been implemented, it is feared that it will be difficult to make an exception. In the future, foreign merchants' shipping routes in North China will inevitably encounter the same treatment as the Yangtze River.

### Shanghai Race Club Charitable Donations Last Year

According to the French-language "Journal de Shanghai" on the 4th, the Shanghai Race Club donated 138,880 yuan to charity in 1939, including 25,000 yuan to the Foreign Charities Association and 25,000 yuan to the British War Fund.

### Winter High Tide Season Nears

The Huangpu River will have another high tide starting on the 8th of this month, lasting until the 11th. The tide volume will be above ten feet, making it the highest during the winter low tide season. Also, due to the shallow water in the Yangtze River estuary, the water level this winter is lower than in previous years.

### Japanese Reportedly Returning Survey Vessel "Liliang" and Others

Although some of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau's dredgers have been returned, many of the ships' machines have rusted, so they still need to be dismantled for inspection and repair. The Japanese have also agreed to return survey vessels such as the "Liliang" within days. The Bureau plans to begin surveying the Huangpu River channel after the survey vessels are returned in order to dredge it. The Bureau's Zhanghuabang Shipyard has not yet been vacated since it was occupied, so the Bureau has been unable to complete the handover procedures. The shipyard originally had complete facilities such as docks, and the construction was extremely complete. Since it has been occupied for two years and damaged by the war, the restoration work will require a considerable amount of repair time.

### Traffic Regulations for Rue du Consulat, Formulated by French Municipal Council, Effective from the 1st

The French Concession Municipal Council, due to the heavy traffic on Rue du Consulat, has formulated traffic regulations to ensure traffic safety and reduce unfortunate accidents. The police department has been instructed to strictly enforce these regulations.

During the above times, no vehicles are allowed to stop on Rue du Consulat, even for loading or unloading goods. Outside of these times, slow-moving vehicles going to or leaving the area for loading or unloading goods should enter or leave via the nearest side street."

### Adult Literacy Association, Literacy Program, New Year Play to Raise Funds for Expansion

The Shanghai Adult Compulsory Education Promotion Association was established in June 1939. In view of the large number of adults who have lost their schooling on the isolated island, it opened schools in the fall, setting up schools in four districts, east, south, west, and north. The first phase had eight schools, the second phase had ten schools, and there were fifteen special schools. More than 3,000 people have been trained to eliminate illiteracy. Now, with the opportunity of the New Year's dress rehearsal of the Municipal Council Chinese Staff Club, the association will perform a charity performance for one day to raise funds to expand the number of students. Yesterday afternoon, Chairman Chen Yishan hosted a banquet for dozens of directors including Li Wenlan Ting, Jiang Yiping, Lu Gaoyi, Chen Wenyuan, Xie Xiangzhi, Zhang Yuanfu, Fu Jusheng, Huang Jingwan, Hu Daling, and others to discuss ways to promote the sale of theater tickets and study the implementation steps for the next semester to achieve greater results.

Renewal of Love and Affection for Couples

How to Enhance Your New Energy to Create Your New Life…

1939 is gone, 1940 is here. We are another year older! Ah! If we do not create some new life, then it will be as quick to rot as grass and trees!

Love and life cannot be separated: Love is produced from life, and can also produce new life; Life cannot do without love, and without love it cannot become a healthy life. Life should be new, and love must not be stale. These few simple words are the secret of conjugal life. Look! The husband is always the same, which makes his wife so annoyed! If he brings new interest and shows new energy, his wife will surely welcome him wholeheartedly. That is what is called deep love between husband and wife, and there is endless marital bliss! However, new interests and new energy must come from a healthy body. If a man has committed self-abuse, nocturnal emission, early marriage, debauchery, etc., in his youth, consuming too much of the reproductive gland fluid (i.e., semen), which is the source of life, then he will inevitably suffer from neurasthenia, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, brain weakness, kidney deficiency, and other symptoms. Such a sick man, even if he is happy for the New Year, and he is with a beauty or has wives and concubines in his arms and can enjoy himself in time, he is also bored and dull to the extreme, because of insufficient energy! This causes the breakdown of love between husband and wife, and the resulting tragedies of elopement, divorce, etc., are innumerable! Therefore, to seek the renewal of love between husband and wife, one must start with enhancing new energy; to seek the creation of new life, it is especially necessary to enhance new energy.

According to the instructions of thousands of famous doctors' medical records in the world, and the proof of our more than ten years of experience, the most effective way to enhance new energy is to take the "Shengzhisu" made from the reproductive glands of strong animals. Because this agent is of precious quality and has definite efficacy, it cannot be matched by any similar agent. After taking it, you can produce semen and nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood, nourish the nerves, and promote development within the same day or night. Continuous taking will surely cure all symptoms in a short period of time, and make energy double and abundant. Middle-aged and elderly people who often take it in winter and spring will prolong life and rejuvenate. However, those who have spermatorrhea must also take the "Hymexol Sperm-Locking Tablets," a special medicine for treating spermatorrhea, to stop the leakage, and the effect will be even faster!

Patient Deng Xiongfei, from Hubei, 29 years old, an import and export merchant, married for five years, never had children, because he committed self-abuse and indulged in lust in his early years, resulting in kidney deficiency and impotence, and the object was also short and small like a finger. His wife's love for him was weak, and recently he suffered from nocturnal emission and brain weakness, which greatly affected his business and made him feel bored! Although he repeatedly took various medicines on the market, none of them had any effect. Last month, he was introduced to this clinic by a friend for diagnosis and treatment. After a specialist physician carefully examined his condition, he instructed him to buy two dozen "Shengzhisu" and one dozen "Hymexol Sperm-Locking Tablets" at the Sino-Western Pharmacy and take them at the same time. He also used new medical techniques such as electrotherapy injections. After more than a month, all his illnesses disappeared, his mind was clear, his energy doubled, and the love between husband and wife was also extremely deep.

### How Can the Breasts Achieve Health and Beauty?

— Yao Chongpei, American Doctor of Medicine

Beautiful breasts can indeed increase a woman's beautiful posture. The so-called curves are completely controlled by the breasts. If there are no well-developed breasts, how can the curves be prominent? I think it is naturally impossible, so breast development has become a required course for modern women. When she sees that her breast develop cannot reach the standard, she does not hesitate to use various methods to deceive people, but when the spring scenery comedy prelude opens, this kind of Western bell still wears through, and men see it as worthless, or even make cold remarks, making her ashamed and nowhere to hide, and her mood is rebellious. For a man who is unfaithful to love, that is even more unimaginable!

Then, why do women have this defect? This kind of research result by famous Chinese and Western gynecologists and us all believes that it is entirely due to malnutrition, self-binding the chest, leucorrhea, major diseases, chronic malaria, and various reasons such as failure to recuperate after childbirth, resulting in impaired ovarian function, affecting metabolism, so the breasts are loose and atrophied, even as flat as a man, the buttocks are thin, the muscles are withered, and what is especially hateful is that although in the prime of youth, the forehead is already full of wrinkles. With such an ugly woman, if she wants to win in the love arena or win her husband's heart, can she get it? The only remedy is to take the reproductive gland ovarian agent female "Shengzhisu," which is the most suitable and effective. This agent was invented by the German medical sage Dr. Sthann, who accumulated more than thirty years of hard experiments. Therefore, the drug is very peaceful and has great effects. No matter what kind of women's hidden diseases, all can be cured in a short period of time. If you continue to take it, not only can it make the atrophied breasts become towering, and the thin buttocks become plump, but it can also eliminate uterine diseases, promote pregnancy function, beautify the face and blacken the hair, and keep youth forever.

### The Crisis of Nocturnal Emission in Deep Winter

— Venereal Disease Specialist Nian Zeng

"If you don't store essence in winter, you will get sick in spring!" This old saying passed down by the experience of the predecessors, I think everyone has heard it! Originally, a man's seminal fluid is indeed the source of his life. Especially in this winter season, even husbands with wives should reduce sexual activity to nourish and conserve their essence to ensure their health. But how can those who suffer from nocturnal emission store and nourish their essence?

The nights in winter are so long, and the climate is so cold. If the quilts are not enough, patients with nocturnal emission are the most unable to endure the cold, and they feel cold and difficult to sleep; but if they are covered too much, patients with nocturnal emission are most likely to have dreams, and the sexual nerves in the dream are stimulated, and the seminal fluid is uncontrollably discharged. Or when you wake up, your crotch is already sticky and wet. At this time, even if you regret it, it is too late! Again and again, the nerves will become weaker and weaker, the development function will stagnate, and the metabolic effect will be reduced. In the end, all kinds of symptoms such as brain weakness and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitation, back pain and pain, premature ejaculation and impotence, and incomplete development will not be enough. If you delay treatment, the crisis of the coming spring is even more unimaginable! How many young people have lost their health due to untreated nocturnal emission, and are trapped in the tragic situation of losing their studies, losing their jobs, losing their love, and losing happiness with their wives?! Or even become prematurely old and die young! To seek an early cure for nocturnal emission, according to world-famous doctors and my experience, it seems that taking "Hymexol Sperm-Locking Tablets" is the most effective remedy. This agent is secretly made by the German medical sage Dr. Hymexol, and has the special effects of consolidating the sperm valve and tranquilizing the nerves. After taking it, you can get a good night's sleep and stop the emission. Continuing to take it will surely cure spermatorrhea. However, those who have already had the above-mentioned symptoms due to spermatorrhea must also take the reproductive gland agent "Shengzhisu" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, nourish the nerves, and promote development. Then, both treating the symptoms and treating the root cause will surely restore full health as soon as possible. If patients can come to this clinic for diagnosis and treatment, a cure can be guaranteed.

### Last December's Living Expenses Increased Twofold Compared to Pre-War Levels; Rice Price Soared Most Severely; Oil Price Tripled in One Year; From This Year Onward, All Shanghai Merchants and Residents Should Work Together to Stabilize Prices

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council Gazette, the cost of living index for workers in Shanghai in December of the 28th year of the Republic reached a peak of 304.06, an average increase of 200% compared to the pre-war year of the 25th year of the Republic. It increased by 100% compared to January of this year, and also increased by 19.5% compared to last month. The classified indices also rose sharply at the same time. The food index was 38.08, an increase of 27.42% compared to last month; fuel was 351.96, an increase of 15.17%; miscellaneous items were 226.85, an increase of 8.36%; and clothing was 223.08, an increase of 3.63%. As for the purchasing power of currency, one yuan of legal tender in the 25th year of the Republic is now worth only 3 jiao, 2 fen, 8 or 9 hao.

Rice Price

The high price of rice has had the most severe impact. Last month, each dan was nearly 40 yuan, and then it soared day by day. Within a week, it rose to 48 yuan. The authorities in the concessions, seeing that the trend of speculation and hoarding could not be contained and that the livelihood of the citizens was worrying, jointly issued a notice on the 10th, strictly cracking down, promulgating penalty rules, expelling violators from the three jurisdictions, confiscating inventory, and resetting the price limit. The highest price of japonica rice should not exceed 45 yuan per dan, and indica rice should not exceed 38 yuan. The rising trend has been slightly curbed. The price limit was then lowered to a maximum of 40 yuan for japonica rice and 33 yuan for indica rice. At the height of the rice panic, rice grabbing was frequently seen. All sectors shouted loudly to reduce the price of rice and maintain the people's food supply. However, by the end of the month, it was still standing at the limit price of 40 yuan, and no further decline was seen. Once rice becomes expensive, all goods become expensive. Living expenses have reached an unprecedented high price.

Oil Price

Soybean oil is an essential seasoning. This month, speculation and manipulation in the oil market were very active. The market price is rising. From January to March of this year, the price of oil per jin was around 2 jiao and 4 fen. From April to July, it was 3 jiao and 5 fen. From August to November, it was still hovering around 5 jiao. When it entered this month, it reached an unprecedented high price of 1 yuan, an increase of 68% compared to November. Within one year, it increased by more than 300%. Lard is also necessary for seasoning, and it also increased by 60% compared to last month.

Tofu

Due to the soaring prices of raw materials such as soybeans, soybean oil, and gypsum, the tofu industry in Shanghai suspended business for three days from the 19th of this month to rectify industry regulations and announced price increases to maintain costs. Tofu and dried tofu increased by 25%, bai ye increased by 50%, and fried tofu increased by 60%. Tofu products are a daily necessity for citizens' meals. Once they soar, the impact is significant.

Fuel

This month, the selling price of coal balls per dan once again reached more than 4 yuan. Due to the hindered sources of waste firewood and kindling, the increase was very high. Waste firewood increased by 50% compared to last month, and kindling increased by 29.23%. Since fuel is expensive, the hot water industry also announced price increases. The increase this time is 50%. Before the war, every ten ladles of hot water sold for 1 fen and 7 li, now it is 5 fen.

The prices of the above-mentioned items have risen the most sharply, but they are all daily necessities and indispensable items, so the impact on citizens is profound and crucial. The index table is recorded below.

New base period: The average in the 25th year of the Republic equals 100

### Shanghai Municipal Council Announces Entertainment Tax Amount

Last Eleven Months

The entertainment tax collected by the Shanghai Municipal Council, from January 1st of last year to November 30th, totaled 334,612 yuan, 4 jiao and 6 fen. Together with the surplus from the previous year, 35,647 yuan, 3 jiao and 4 fen, and the surplus from rice sales, 53,864 yuan, 4 jiao and 1 fen, the total was 424,124 yuan, 2 jiao and 1 fen. The various uses were allocated as follows:

1.  Allocated to refugee reception organizations for subsidies (224,971.58 yuan)

2.  Hospital expenses directly related to refugees (61,627.08 yuan)

3.  For refugees' vaccination and inoculation (22,290.91 yuan)

### Revised Inspection Measures for Passengers Entering and Exiting the Shanghai-Ningbo Line

The Ningbo Defense Command has recently revised the measures for inspecting passengers as follows: (1) For passengers exiting, the Yong team is only responsible for inspection and does not collect passes. Each time passengers exit, the Zhen team collects them on the large ship. (2) For passengers entering, the Zhen team sends a small number of soldiers to monitor the ship, maintain order when disembarking, and prevent passengers from entering on cargo ships in an attempt to avoid inspection. Some soldiers and privates inspect passengers disembarking from the Zhen sea at the dock and collect their passes. Passengers landing in Ningbo are inspected by the Yong team, and their passes are collected and sent to the Zhen team for collection. (3) Regardless of Yong or Zhen, only one copy is collected when collecting entry passes, and the remaining copy is still given to the passenger. (4) Customs brokers and other small boats hired to pick up passengers must obtain instructions and permission from the Zhen team before being allowed to approach the large ship, but they are still not allowed to carry other passengers. (5) Baggage carriers at the Jiangbei Wharf should follow the regulations and prepare numbered clothing and hats for identification, but the number should not exceed 30. Each piece of luggage should not be charged more than 5 fen.

By November of last year, the total number had exceeded 8,000, and by the end of the year it had reached around 8,300. Later, due to the New Year holiday, the court was closed, and prisoners who had completed their terms were released, so the number of prisoners this morning (4th) has temporarily dropped to below 8,200. However, it is expected that the criminals arrested during the holiday will cause the number of prisoners in the West Prison to reach a new record in the next few days and continue to increase sharply. There are still many empty cells in the prison now, and the prison officers and food supply are sufficient to cope with the situation.

People in the Bad District

Cannot Make a Living

Since the opening of the iron gate of Xinkaihe, the number of people going from the concessions to the South City every day has been extremely crowded, and the statistics have already reached hundreds of thousands. At present, the Japanese's Shanghai South Team has discovered forged citizen certificates, so although they once stopped the passage, they also delayed the opening date of other iron gates. However, the two items of opium and gambling in the South City have already shown a trend of activity. According to news obtained by reporters from the Chinese News Agency, several gambling tables in western Shanghai, due to high profits, are planning to organize a large-scale company to develop a part of the gambling tables to the South City.

He had monetary disputes with a fellow villager named Wang Yuepo (Wang is the stationmaster of the Jinan Railway Station), and they quarreled with each other. Wang Yuepo entrusted his fellow villager Jin Maode, who lived in Ersan Jingli, Peng Road, to mediate. Later, Wang Yuepo was extorted 160 yuan by Zhang Pinqing, and Zhang's purpose was to settle the matter with 3,700 yuan, so he continued to pester Yu Maode. Jin had no choice but to entrust Liu Zhaonian, a Chinese detective in the anti-drug department of the Central Police Station, to mediate. Zhang Pinqing strongly disagreed, and there was still no result. So, at 5:50 pm on the 1st of this month, he gathered many ronin, hired a car to Ersan Jingli, Peng Road, and told Yu Maode's wife, Wang, to go to Detective Liu's house with him to make things difficult for him.

Yesterday, he was sent to the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, prosecuted him for the crime of extortion and asked for an adjournment to question the defendant.

Now Li confessed in the police station that he initiated the case because the plaintiff Mao Shaoqing's business was thriving, so he discussed extortion with Wang. Wang wrote the letter, and if they obtained the money in the future, it would be divided equally. Now the case still needs to be investigated and a request for postponement was made. According to Mao Shaoqing's complaint, after a brief interrogation by Judge Chuan Lin to Li and Wang, he ordered them to be detained for a retrial in seven days.

Unexpectedly, Sassoon & Co. used the excuse that there were too many noisy people and suddenly forced them to move out. After repeated negotiations by the Qixing Company, they tried to improve within the possible scope to satisfy the landlord. However, on New Year's Day, the 29th year of the Republic of China, the company ordered craftsmen to cut off the water and electricity, which are essential for life, and stopped using the elevator. At that time, the hometown restaurant happened to be brightly lit, and there were many guests. Suddenly, all water and electricity were cut off, and it became dark.

Lawyers are in the profession of protecting human rights. People who do not seek legal advice can hire a lawyer as a legal advisor. After being hired, the lawyer publishes a public notice to serve as the legal protector of the hiring party. The term of such an advisor is usually one year. Therefore, the newspapers on January 1st must have a large number of advertisements for the continued appointment of legal advisors, which has become a common practice. Unexpectedly, after the advertisement was published, some people who were skilled in deception used it to carry out their cunning schemes. The method was to call a company or individual that a lawyer had been hired by and claim that they were introduced by a certain lawyer to sell light bulbs and medicines. Because the lawyer has been hired as an advisor, there must be a considerable relationship, and if they are not careful and allow the purchase, then the item is not worth half of the price paid. Some even borrow money and goods in the name of the lawyer. Several cases of this kind of fraud have now been discovered, and fortunately, none have been deceived. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention. The Zhonghe Real Estate Silver Company at No. 201 Tianjin Road in Shanghai has a thriving business and outstanding credit. The real estate and construction projects completed this year are estimated to be worth more than 4 million yuan, which is enough to hold the leading position in the real estate industry in Shanghai. Recently, Mr. Zhu Xiaofang, the manager of the company, has solved the housing problem for residents of the isolated island, and has specially built "He Village," "Zhonghe Third Village," "Zhonghe Fourth Village," "Zhonghe Fifth Village," and "Zhonghe Seventh Village," etc., a total of more than 100 houses for rent and sale by the house. In particular, the "He Village" houses at the corner of Xiai Xians Road and Ladu Road are the most economical and practical, with each house selling for only 6,800 yuan and up. A quarterly of real estate in the 29th year is also compiled for all sectors to request by mail.

### Mongolian Low Pressure Advances; Shanghai Warm Like Spring

Minimum Temperature is 35.1 Degrees; The Local Weather Will Undergo Drastic Changes

Although the weather in Shanghai has entered the depths of winter, it is unseasonably warm, as if it were the third month of spring. Yesterday's weather was even warmer. According to reporters from Datong News Agency, who inquired with the Xujiahui Observatory, the low temperature between 5:00 and 6:00 am yesterday was 35.1 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 degrees Celsius above zero). According to a survey of the climate around Tianjin, it is even warmer than Shanghai.

It is speculated that the weather in Shanghai will change dramatically and that the arrival of severe cold is not far away. Residents should pay attention to adjusting their clothing.

### Ministry of Education Orders the Issuance of Provincial and Municipal Education Association Regulations; Organizations Already Established Must Submit Reports

(Chongqing Airmail News) The Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Education have jointly drafted thirty-five articles of standard regulations for provincial and municipal education associations. In addition to the Ministry of Social Affairs distributing them, the Ministry of Education has ordered each bureau to relay these to subordinate organizations and instructed them to submit reports detailing the names of responsible persons and the general status of affairs for already established education associations. The purpose of the associations is to research educational undertakings, develop local education, and promote social culture, with the administrative regions of provinces and municipalities as their areas of operation. Their tasks are sixfold: (1) researching, designing, and improving local education; (2) guiding the enhancement of knowledge for people's livelihoods; (3) conducting surveys, statistics, and translations of local education; (4) organizing various educational research meetings and academic lectures; (5) handling matters entrusted by educational administrative agencies; and (6) handling other matters in line with the purposes of the education associations. The implementation of various educational matters must be approved by the supervisory authority. Regarding educational matters, the associations may make suggestions to educational administrative agencies and respond to consultations from administrative agencies. The establishment of the associations should require the consent of more than half of the affiliated "county/city" and "district" education associations. "Provincial/Municipal" education associations are jointly organized by each "county/city" and "district" education association, each selecting an equal number of representatives, but the number of representatives should not exceed "three" or "four" people. The association establishes seven to eleven directors and five to seven supervisors, with five alternate directors and two alternate supervisors, elected by the general meeting. Among the directors, three standing directors are mutually elected to execute daily affairs. The general meeting is held once a year, and a special meeting may be convened at the request of one-fifth or more of the members. The association's funds are divided into several types: (1) government subsidies; (2) funds contributed by lower-level education associations; (3) special donations; and (4) interest from capital. The dissolution of the association should be decided upon by a two-thirds majority of members present and in agreement, and should be submitted to the competent supervisory authority, along with the procedures for liquidation and disposal of assets.

### Overview of the Promotion of Compulsory Education in China (I)

(Chongqing Airmail News) Gu Shusen, Director of the General Education Department of the Ministry of Education, recently wrote "A General Review of the Promotion of Compulsory Education in Our Country," detailing the progress of compulsory education in China. The key points are recorded below:

(I) General Overview

The strength of a nation depends not only on its vast territory, abundant resources, and large population, but also on the general knowledge of the entire nation, a clear understanding of national concepts, and awareness of global trends. Only then can it utilize its vast and advantageous position to maximize its effectiveness. Today, countries around the world are focusing on popularizing universal education and extending the duration of compulsory education as one of the key educational strategies, with the aim of developing public intelligence, raising cultural standards, and creating citizens of modern constitutional states. It has been found that the total number of illiterate people in our country reaches more than 80%, and the number of out-of-school children accounts for more than 50% of all school-age children. The magnitude of these numbers is truly alarming. Therefore, promoting compulsory education and popularizing civil education are urgent tasks at present, especially during the period of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. Efforts should be doubled, and methods should be determined to establish a foundation for national revival. The Ministry of Education formulated various implementation measures for promoting compulsory education four or five years ago, strictly ordering all provinces and cities to comply. The progress and results of the actual implementation are briefly outlined below for reference by those studying this issue and policymakers. (To be continued)

### Excellent Masterpiece, Wonderful Performance: Lido Crushes Xiphos with a Score of 2-0, One Goal in Each Half; Seven Wins in Seven Matches, the Group A Championship is Assured

The Lido and Xiphos played a West Union Group A soccer match at the Recreation Ground the day after New Year's Day. The encounter between the two powerhouses, coinciding with the New Year's holiday, attracted over ten thousand spectators. As a result of the competition, Lido defeated Xiphos with a score of 2-0, creating an undefeated record of seven wins in seven matches in Group A. One goal was scored in each half. The offensive and defensive plays of both sides were very exciting, unprecedented this season. Now that Lido's biggest enemy in the first round has been eliminated, the championship is practically guaranteed. The lineups of both sides are as follows:

Lido

Lu Zhongen

Li Yichen, Zhang Lingen

Yan Shixin, Meng Yiliang, Jiang Zhaoxiang

Cao Qiuting, Sun Jinshun, Huang Kehou, Xu Wenkui, Wu Qixiang

Xiphos

Aigensheng

Kai Moer, McDonald

McShernon, Max Gan, Smilie

Thomas, Duncan, Speiss, Gilmour, Ross

Goal Scorers and Defenders Display Their Skills

Lido was unusually active across the entire line that day. The entire battle was completely under their control. The result of 2-0 was no accident. It can be said to be Lido's excellent masterpiece. Especially Cao Qiuting and Wu Qixiang on both wings, their sprints and movements were sharp and terrifying. Each time they penetrated deep and crossed the ball, the opponent was thrown into chaos. It is a pity that the center did not respond effectively. Aigensheng, the goalkeeper of Xiphos, performed miraculously that day. A ball that was almost impossible to save was actually saved. The two fullbacks, Kai Moer and McDonald, were like two iron gates. Therefore, this game was nothing less than a performance of attack and defense. Xiphos was penalized for Fraser's foul, and the forwards were like a scattered plate of sand, with no offensive coordination at all. Because Yichen, Yiliang, and other generals were stationed in the back, the opponent could not advance an inch, they could only defend, so it was known that Xiphos would lose.

The Steel Gate Falls Under Fierce Attack

Lido, with its back to the sun, and taking advantage of the wind, had all three conditions of favorable timing, terrain, and human harmony. The Soviet army kicked off, and the situation immediately came under the control of Lido. Huang Kehou, Xu Wenkui, and Sun Jinshun launched a rapid attack, making the steel gate Aigenson overwhelmed. Fortunately, Xiphos's defense was tight. Many opportunities that Lido was bound to score were lost due to the two guards' agile interception. The stalemate lasted for 24 minutes. Although Xiphos was under the continuous fierce attack of Lido, it still maintained its virgin status. Suddenly, Wu Qixiang took a corner kick, and Sun "Iron Leg" kicked a high ball with an excellent landing point. Huang Kehou flew up and headed it quickly and accurately. Aigenson was caught off guard, and the steel gate began to break. The kickoff from the center line, the situation was still under the control of Lido. The most wonderful triangle passes from Qiuting, Asun, and Aquai. Qiuting took a shot from the baseline, swept across the goal, but Aquai was half a step late, otherwise the iron gate would have to be broken again. At the end of the first half, Lido won by one goal.

The Scottish Army Was Completely Annihilated

After changing sides, Lido's offensive was still not weakening. "Iron Leg" shot fiercely, hitting McDonald's body. Aquai shot again, also rebounding from Kai Moer's abdomen. Qixiang probed into the tiger's den again, taking a shot with an extremely difficult angle. Ai lay on the ground and lifted it, turning it into a corner kick again. Soon Qiuting's header was cut in, falling precisely on the horizontal bar. Sun Huang rushed in like a fly, and Ai calmly caught it again. After a sharp attack by Lido, finally, at 36 minutes, Asun intercepted the ball and passed it to Kehou's feet. Kehou used a smokescreen, lobbing it to Aquai. Xu dribbled it seven or eight yards from the goal and knocked it flat. The ball flew into the right corner, Aigenson missed, and Lido set the victory, winning 2-0.

### Finance: Hong Kong Investors Dump Foreign Exchange After Holiday

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw HSBC's listed rates remain unchanged. In the informal market, the exchange rates for British and American currencies reversed the trend from before the holiday, gradually weakening in quiet trading. This was due to Hong Kong banks returning and dumping exchange, and the lack of appetite from HSBC and other non-specialized banks. Trading opened flat, and then momentarily tightened due to small payments for cotton and wheat. However, this was short-lived, as Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu suddenly offered forward sterling for February, immediately causing rates to return to flat. After this, trading became quieter and once stagnant. Around 11:00 AM, unexpectedly, Hua Bank suddenly released exchange on behalf of Hong Kong Electric, causing the situation to loosen. By the close of the morning session, rates had fallen to four pence seven one eight seven five and seven yuan seven five. In the afternoon, Hong Kong Electric dumped more, and some Chinese merchants also came to settle their positions, causing the market to continue to weaken slightly. As a result, trading closed at four pence seven three four three seven five and seven yuan seven eight one two five, weaker than the previous weekend for both British and American currencies. Sterling was down 0.078125, and the US dollar was up 0.125, due to the fall in the exchange rate. The potential for futures contracts was slightly tighter than the spot rates for the US dollar, with a difference of only 0.0625 at the close, equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commissions) of only about 7.5%. Therefore, arbitrage trading gradually decreased.

Qiao Zhifu Sells Futures

In the morning, recent London sterling contracts decreased by 8.75, and distant contracts fell by 9.375. New York silver prices remained flat, and London spot gold remained stable. Exchange rates for sterling against US dollars, Shanghai, and French francs were all flat, while the US dollar depreciated by 8.75 against sterling, 0.05 against Shanghai, and a small amount against French francs (all the above were calculated after balancing against pre-holiday rates). The central bank's listed rates for each currency remained unchanged. Banks' opening selling prices for spot exchange were four pence six five six two five for sterling and seven yuan six five six two five for the US dollar, unchanged from before the holiday. After the opening, the market was quiet and there was little trading. After HSBC's listed rates were announced to be unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was announced to be slightly lower at 0.55, there were some settlements for cotton and wheat, with US banks buying US dollars for January delivery at seven yuan five six two five and half a yuan. The situation seemed slightly weak, but before long, Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu suddenly offered a January sterling contract to a non-specialized bank at four pence five nine three seven five, and the market stabilized. Later, the situation was quiet for a long time. Around 11:00 AM, Hua Bank, East Asia, Overseas Chinese, etc., suddenly released exchange on behalf of Hong Kong Electric, causing the market to loosen. It sold spot sterling at four pence six seven one eight seven five and seven one eight seven five to a certain bank that was favorable. At the same time, a certain bank of Chase also sold spot US dollars to foreign banks and speculators at seven yuan six eight seven five. At noon, the situation calmed down again. Extending to the noon closing, banks' selling prices for spot exchange were four pence seven one eight seven five for sterling and seven yuan seven five for the US dollar, which was sterling down 0.0625 and the US dollar up 0.09375 compared to the morning opening.

In the Afternoon, Chinese Merchants Settle

The afternoon market remained calm. The market continued to weaken slightly due to the continued dumping by Hong Kong Electric and the fact that Chinese merchants also took advantage of the opportunity to settle their positions. Hong Kong Electric entrusted Hua Bank to sell spot sterling to foreign banks at four pence seven three four three seven five. Then, Chinese merchants sold spot US dollars to foreign banks at seven yuan eight one two five. At the same time, a certain bank that was favorable also sold US dollars for March delivery to peer banks at seven yuan five. After entering, the situation became more stable. Extending to the evening closing, banks' selling prices for spot exchange were four pence seven three four three seven five for sterling and seven yuan seven eight one two five for the US dollar. Sterling for the next month was four pence seven zero three one two five, and the US dollar was seven yuan seven one eight seven five. As a result, compared to before the holiday (i.e., the previous weekend), spot sterling was down 0.078125 and the US dollar was up 0.125. Sterling futures were also cheaper by 0.078125, while the US dollar tightened by 0.15625.

Hong Kong Exchange Market is Very Stable

### New Year Holiday Ends: Gold Market Languishes

Yesterday, the "Yaseh" (a term for speculative gold trading) dark market was lackluster. After the New Year holiday, the market reopened as usual, but the bullish sentiment remained weak and difficult to revive. Moreover, the foreign exchange market entered a period of depreciation. Although Hong Kong banks intervened to buy, the amount was limited. As a result, the price fell by $29. The morning opening was unenthusiastic, with a gold firm taking the lead in lowering the price and selling, resulting in a $20 drop to $4,135. Later, due to good buying appetite from Hong Kong banks and retail investors, the price briefly rose to $4,165. However, some gold firms seized the opportunity to sell, so the favorable situation did not last long. With the exchange rate weakening and selling pressure intensifying, the price at noon was only $4,131. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange market continued to weaken, resulting in another $18 drop to a low price of $4,113. Afterwards, retail investors who had sold earlier came back to buy, so the closing price was $4,126. The total trading volume for the day was about 1,600 to 1,700 taels. Gold jewelry shops lowered their prices by $5. Customs gold remained unchanged.

"Yaseh" Drops $29

Since the beginning of each bar (ten taels), the general sentiment was weak due to the lack of continued appreciation in the foreign exchange market. A gold firm took the lead in lowering the price and selling. The market opened at 9:35 AM, $20 lower than before the holiday (i.e., last Saturday), with the gold firm selling 40 taels to jewelry shops at $4,135. Soon after, speculators bought cheaply, and Hong Kong banks also entrusted a jewelry shop and money changers to buy, coupled with sellers holding back, the price soon rose by $30. Money changers bought 50 taels from the gold firm at $4,165. Afterwards, buyers were content, and gold firms, money changers, and securities firms continued to sell, resulting in a further drop of $23. The securities firm sold 20 taels to jewelry shops at $4,142. Subsequently, Hong Kong banks, seeing the price was low, entrusted a money changer to buy, and the price rose again by $15. The money changer bought 10 taels from the jewelry shop at $4,157. Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange market suddenly hardened, and the price could not be sustained. A silver firm sold on behalf of those holding long positions, and gold firms and jewelry shops also dumped their holdings. There was a lack of support, and the price fell by $27. The silver firm sold 40 taels to the gold firm at $4,130. Subsequently, the silver firm repeatedly bought 50 taels from the gold firm at $4,130 as the noon closing price. The market opened flat in the afternoon, initially with the gold firm selling 20 taels to the securities firm at $4,130, a drop of $1. Afterwards, a securities firm came to sell, and money changers also closed positions for retail investors. With the foreign exchange market slightly hardening, the price fell again by $17. The securities firm sold 20 taels to the money changer at $4,113. After that, selling pressure gradually subsided, and the foreign exchange market turned flat. Many retail investors who had closed long positions came back to buy at low prices. At the same time, a gold firm also bought, and the price rebounded by $13. The gold firm bought 30 taels from the money changer at $4,126 as the evening closing price. As a result, the price dropped by $29 compared to before the holiday, with a fluctuation of $52 for the whole day. The current selling price of gold firms' own-brand gold is several dollars higher than the "Yaseh" price, while the buying price is $20 lower. The current standard gold price is more than $50 lower than the listed price, and there are few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Drops $5

The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael in jewelry shops was still $420 at Dahongxing. At 2:30 PM, the price was lowered by $5. As a result, Dahongxing changed the price to $415. The new shops had the same price as the previous one, and the buying price was reduced by about $15.

### Foreign Currency Plummets: US Dollar Notes Enter $13 Territory

Yesterday, foreign currencies were weak due to the impact of an oversupply of foreign exchange. There was little demand for British and American gold pounds, while the supply of British and American gold notes was abundant, resulting in a weak market. In the morning, British gold notes fell to $46.75, and US dollar notes fell to $13. The weakness continued in the afternoon, with customers holding back. The intense atmosphere of peace led to a downstream market. The evening market saw US dollar notes fall to $12.875. Hong Kong notes were soft due to a plentiful supply of Hong Kong telegraph transfers and stagnant absorption. The price of Annam piasters was also low. Cambodian notes trended downward due to the weakness of US dollar notes. Philippine notes had strong demand, and the market price was strong. Japanese gold notes were very firm, with an evening price of $1.275. Korean notes, on the other hand, were weak, with an evening price of $1.10. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold pounds fall by $0.80, British gold notes by $0.20, American gold pounds by $0.90, US dollar notes by $0.29, Hong Kong notes by $0.03, French franc notes by $0.008, Annam notes by $0.01, rupee notes by $0.05, Canadian notes by $0.10, Philippine notes rise by $0.30, and other currencies unchanged.

### Silver Plummets in London: Indian Silver Stable

London, 3rd: The silver market saw selling pressure from India and speculators, lacking support, and the price fell sharply. After the close, the market turned flat. Buyers were willing to pay 0.0625 higher than the listed price, but sellers were still unwilling to supply. Spot silver fell by 0.875, and forward silver fell by 0.9375. New York silver: Spot prices remained unchanged. Bombay silver: The Indian silver market was calm, with spot and January prices all at 3 annas, and February unchanged.

### Discount Rate Drops Sharply

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts and bills suddenly dropped sharply, initially to $38 per thousand, and continued to fall to $37 by noon. The price remained unchanged in the afternoon, $2 lower than before the holiday (last Saturday). The money industry association quoted an overnight rate of 1.5 cents for both morning and afternoon, it is said.

### Securities: Peace Atmosphere Drives Bond Market

Reasons for the Rise of Rubber Stocks

The securities dark market reopened yesterday, with a positive mood. The peace atmosphere rumored in the market was gathered and logically deduced from various sources, with some clues to be found. Speculators were active, and investors also joined in. In terms of the actual strength of the buying and selling parties in the market, Guangdong financial groups and small financial circles invested quite a bit. The rest were buying more and selling less, but retail investors were still mostly selling. The trend was good, and Class C bonds are expected to cross the $50 mark. Yesterday's trading was slow in the morning, with only Lianyi showing strong buying interest. Sellers were mostly retail investors, and market prices were already firming. In the afternoon, the peace news suddenly intensified, and Guangdong financial groups were very enthusiastic in buying. Class A bonds, which had previously reached $60 but failed to break through, suddenly surged through the barrier. Class B bonds also reached over $51, and Class C bonds also broke through $9. Class D bonds, which had been extremely sluggish, also broke through $8. Buyers were mostly Shengda and No. 20. Xinfu and Tongkang also had considerable buying volume. Lianhe bought Class A and sold Class C, as its lottery draw had recently increased its price faster. As for the rest, Jiufeng offered more supply, Lianyi closed some positions, and retail investors still sold a lot. Market prices all rose by $0.06 to $0.085. The total transaction volume was about $800,000. A brief summary table is listed below.

Stock Transactions: 20 shares of Ning Shao Steamship Company were traded at a price of $8.15.

The public industry shares attracted the most attention yesterday. Prices were firm. Yeguang Real Estate Company shares rose to $14. Yihé Spinning Mill shares also reached a new high price of $28.9. Trust company shares were pulled up quite a bit in the morning. Afterwards, due to many profit-taking, prices fell slightly. Rubber stocks continued to rise after the holiday. All stocks had a new round of price increases. The transaction volume, compared to the total amount of each stock issue, cannot be said to be large. This clearly indicates that sellers were unwilling to sell more. The valuation of stock prices should continue to increase. If all current prices are compared with those of a year ago, the reason is easy to understand. The selling price of raw rubber a year ago was much lower than now, and the export quota at that time was as low as 45%. It has recently increased to 80%. Even leaving this aside for analysis, statistics show that current prices are still lower than last year. Based on various circumstances, it can be seen that the income and profits of various rubber companies in the past three months and in the coming months will greatly increase. Producers have now been able to export three-quarters of their output, while raw rubber prices are also trending higher. Considering all these factors, the current boom in the rubber stock market is indeed natural. However, some low-priced stocks, after continuous pull-ups, have become detached from the valuation of many high-priced stocks. This is probably due to the large number of small speculators in the market recently.

London, 3rd: Yesterday and today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt were stable. The prices of various bonds remained unchanged. London, 3rd: Yesterday and today, the listed prices of British Far East companies' stocks showed a slight increase. Yesterday, only Gulake Lympond Rubber shares rose by 7.5 pence, with a price of 23 shillings and 1.5 pence. Today, Maccari Bank shares rose by 1 shilling and 3 pence, to 8 pounds, 13 shillings and 9 pence. HSBC shares each rose by half a pound, with British-registered shares at 82 pounds and Hong Kong-registered shares at 84.5 pounds. The rest were flat.

### Grains: Rice Market Thrives, Market Sentiment Gradually Loosens

Jing Rice: Since the rice market closed for two days for New Year's Day, the number of shipments from the inland sources of Shanhongkou District was huge, no less than 5,300 bags. The goods previously stored in warehouses, seeing this surge in arrivals, were not discouraged and offered samples. For a time, all kinds of goods flooded the market, and large amounts of foreign rice arrived one after another, and were sold on the market at the same time, so buyers did not dare to handle them rashly. Regardless of retail or wholesale, the market was waiting and watching in the early market, waiting for opportunities. Merchants who owned a large number of spot goods took the opportunity to quickly sell, so they had to cut prices to attract sales, and a downward trend suddenly began. The early and late rice in South Hong Kong initially shouted low by half a dollar, to $36.50, and Saigon at $36.50, which was about half a dollar less than before. But the sales field lacked improvement, and it continued to go downstream, with early and late rice falling to $36, and Saigon at about $36, a fall of more than one dollar. By the noon market, the general merchants believed that the market trend had stabilized and seemed to lack change, and the local shops took the opportunity to buy gradually, and the atmosphere suddenly came alive. Mutual inquiries were particularly welcome for foreign rice, and other Japonica rice was not inferior. As the situation turned lively, the sellers' shouts also rose. As a result, the closing price, except for Changkun Japonica rice, was still limited to $40, and other Su Tong Japonica middle-grade goods were all $38.90, Luo Rice was especially $38, the market price was about $37.50, South Hong Kong early and late was $36.34, small bags was $35.50, Lu Jian was $38 to $37.50, Yang Jian was $37, Saigon High was $36.50, second was $36, Broken Jian was $32 to $31.50, second was $30, Tokyo Yang Jian was $33.50 to $33.1, and $40 second was $37. In terms of the initial fatigue and subsequent tightness, the early market fell sharply, and then it depreciated by another half a dollar to $0.70. The total market turnover was no less than nearly 10,000 bags.

Foreign Rice: Arrivals have been connected for several days. Yesterday, there was another Taikoo ship with more than 10,000 bags to be unloaded. Two or three ships of broken rice and Hong Kong rice, etc., can arrive within the day, so the market sentiment is generally falling. After the market opened on the 3rd, the market fell by $0.45, and yesterday it fell by another half a dollar. No. 1 Saigon was only $36.50 to $36 yesterday, broken rice was high at $32, and second was only $30.60. Daily transactions are also only two or three thousand bags. Because of the impending price stabilization, the sales of rice shops have decreased, and the buying appetite has also slackened. However, it is currently difficult for foreign merchants to approach the price. Yesterday, the west telegram No. 1 rice was $46.30, while the market return road cargo was only opened at $45, it is said.

During the New Year holiday, foreign rice came to Shanghai as usual. The Taikoo Company's Jinan Wheel, carrying 10,711 bags from Hong Kong, arrived on the 3rd and was unloaded completely yesterday.

### Flour Opens at $9: Factory Prices Suddenly Increase by $0.30 Yesterday: Wheat Price Reaches $15.50

Flour: Yesterday, the price of No. 2 flour factory suddenly increased by $0.30, reaching the $9 mark. During the New Year holiday, returned goods had already exceeded $0.45, and the factories had not increased in order to maintain them. Until yesterday, the New Year market opened and prices began to rise, and the price of $9 was only willing to supply one or two hundred bags of retail sales in this street, and the price for customer orders must be $9.50, and there was no large supply, all due to the high price of wheat, the factories had limited flour production, and the price of Japanese flour increased again, and the market sentiment was getting better. There were even more returns for hoarding, and there was no official market. The total market turnover of factory flour was about 20,000 bags. The trading of Japanese flour was more active. In general, speculators flocked to it. The highest price of Phoenix brand in January reached $8.27, and once relaxed to $8.089 in the middle, and then increased to about $0.20 in the afternoon. The price for February must be $8.445, it is said.

Wheat: Yesterday, the wheat market was even more promising. It was found that during the holiday, about 10,000 bags of new Changxi Suguan wheat, etc., arrived. In the sound of expensive flour prices, the wheat market became even more promising. Yesterday, Fuxin Factory handled 4,000 bags, and Fufeng Factory handled 2,000 bags, and the price has reached as high as $15.50. Changxi wheat was $0.10 lower, and there was also a ticket for Jiangbei Chen wheat, which also needed $15.30. The rise can already be seen.

### Oil Market: Hong Kong Banks Purchase Raw Oil

Selling Price Increases by $2: Soybean Oil Falls by $4-5

Raw Oil: The miscellaneous grain and oil cake market opened completely yesterday. The miscellaneous grain market situation did not change much, but the oil market had quite a few ups and downs. Yesterday, raw soybean oil suddenly went against the trend, because peanut oil Hong Kong office was eager to buy, and the price in the producing area was high, the market suddenly became optimistic, the market was $2 higher than the end of last year, and 300 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at a price of $79, 30 barrels of Qingdao barrel oil were at a price of $103, 50 barrels of Jiangbei barrel oil were at a price of $100, and 1,000 cans of Yantai hearing oil were at a price of $101. It was found that 1,000 cans of raw oil came from Tianjin yesterday, 6,200 cans came from Yantai, and 862 pieces came from Qingdao.

Soybean Oil: Although it fell by $4-5, the market that opened yesterday still had little impact on the overall situation, because the source of bucket oil was not strong, and the general market sentiment believed that the foothold was still firm, so the market atmosphere in the field was temporarily flat. The whole market only opened 40 barrels of oil from Changzhou Lai Factory, at a price of $103 to $102.80, 10 barrels of Jiangbei oil at a price of $103, and 800 cans of Jining oil at a price of $102.

Again, 794 cans of barrel oil came from Qingdao yesterday.

### Yarn and Cotton: Under the Shadow of Rumors, Yarn Prices Fall Instead of Rise

The red-market yarn market started, and the trend rose first and then fell. The overseas cotton market continued to rise, and the market sentiment was still optimistic and hopeful, but the actual demand was sluggish, and all the banks had no signs of improvement. The market was about to rise but fell instead. The factory's cost was very high, and the profit was getting thinner day by day, but the inventory was increasing day by day, so the speculators' thoughts were firm, and those who were long also had a small ability to consolidate their will, considering the previous situation.

Because the 20-count Shuangma yarn had been done to $760 at the end of last year, the opening price of current yarn was expected to rise without a doubt, and the asking price was very high before the opening, but there were few people who really took it, so the opening price of 20-count Shuangma was still $760. In a moment, it suddenly fell, and there were rumors in the market that foreign exchange had been released for a long time, and the atmosphere of peace was thick, so the bulls took the opportunity to come out, and the market retreated instead of advancing, falling to $753.50. It was found that 1,389 packages were traded. The market price of 20-count Shuangma was not much different from the price at the end of the year, Tiannv fell by $2, Shuangdiqiu did not move. The amount of each bank's purchase is listed on the left,

Colleagues 1,210 Ningbo 5

Mainland 72 Hong Kong 100

Statistics 1,387

### Overseas Reports Rise: Local Cotton Stands Out: Colleagues' Trading is Lively

Local cotton transactions are still not weak, and colleagues' trading is still lively, but the factory's needs have not seen much improvement, so although the market sentiment is good, the market price is still stable, but overseas European and American cotton markets are advancing day by day, and the purchase price is still difficult to approach, so although the yarn market is tired and depressed, the cotton price is still sold prominently, Subei sources, during the three days of closing the customs, a total of more than 8,000 packages arrived, and more than 1,000 packages of Changyinsha cotton arrived. The current cotton sales situation is recorded on the left,

Grass package fire machine 161.50 Colleagues entered 142 packages

Also 162.00 Also 12 packages

Also 163.00 Also 200 packages

Metling 241.00 Colleagues entered 200 pieces

Fire wood rack 166.2 Also 250 packages

American species packaged 196.00 Shanghai entered 20 pieces

The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market has been very tight in recent days. The cotton price rose by more than 30 pounds yesterday. The cotton market in the morning opened yesterday was still rising due to the pressure of buyers. Later, due to the selling of Wall Street and the closing of long positions, the cotton price turned weak slightly. As a result, it fell by 4-5 pounds compared with the previous day, but it still rose by more than 20 pounds compared with before the holiday. The Indian cotton market rose by 10 rupees compared with before the holiday, Egypt rose by more than 160 pounds, and Liverpool rose by more than 40 pence.

The foreign cotton trade in Shanghai is still extremely quiet these days. All parties have not yet started to handle it. The factory side is not keen to purchase raw cotton as the yarn price has not increased. Colleagues are very interested in futures trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and have turned to neglecting spot trading. The ex-factory price converted from the US exchange rate of $7.75 in yesterday's cotton market is as follows,

20 American Metlin 242.00

20 Also Lower level 37.60

32 Also 249.00

32 Also Lower level 243.00

42 Also 2250

42 Also Lower level 244.60

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Reports an Consistent Rise

Eastern Goods Sales Fall

Guo Bu: Yesterday, cotton cloth opened higher than the end of last year, with white coarse cloth, fine cloth, and twill rising by $0.25 to $0.50 per piece, and bleached and finished fine yarn goods increasing by about $0.50 per piece. The factory's asking price was even higher. Nanyang Bank, North Bank, and Zhegan Bank all handled it. Nanyang Hong Kong Bank traded more than 8,000 pieces of bleached cloth, Hongyang Biao floral cloth, and colored cloth, Yanjin Bank handled 50-60 boxes of An'an blue cloth, and Gan Bank handled more than 30 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill bleached cloth from Yihé and other factories. Dyeing factories in this street handled more than 100 pieces of dyed grey fine cloth and fine twill, and Chuandian Bank handled 50 packages of Daping Fugui fine cloth.

Dong Bu: White fine cloth and fine twill, due to flat sales, and sellers with hand goods eager to come out were rushing to sell, the sales disc was small. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth spot opened in the morning at $22.55, gradually downstream. The lowest price in the afternoon fell to $22.05, and the closing price was $22.15, and the futures trend was still firm, the market disc needed $23, but it was not sold, only a few dozen packages of Longtou fine twill this month were opened, the price was $21.75 per piece. Dong Cotton Bank received $21.25 for the spot settlement of Blue Shuangyu twill, so the fine twill market only fell by $0.05 to $0.10, the fine cloth futures were still stable, and the spot goods fell by about $0.45 compared with before closing.

### Coal: Indian Coal Sees Frequent Increases

Smoke Coal City continued to soar, and the rise became more acute after the opening of the customs. Since Kailuan dissolved the sales office, the source was blocked, and Indian coal has not had a fixed order in recent months due to the European war, and some goods have been used for military purposes, with very few sources, so the panic of lump coal is very serious, and the market price has increased frequently. Yesterday, the Indian coal line also added $5, the market sent customers, lump coal $132 per ton, and the price was added $2 on the basis of the offer.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Initially Tight and Then Loose

Guo Tang had transactions on the second, third and fourth days during the closure period, and Jian Bank opened more than 600 packages of Taikoo Wheel to Dia Qing, at a price of $45, Xinghua Bank opened 260 packages of ordinary Gongge Red, at $42.80, dozens of packages of Da Gong powder, at $53.2 (cash) , Guang Bank opened more than 40 packages of High Hainan Red, at $41, and according to the news from Shantou numbers, because a certain party holds it, the cost of the later batches of Chao Tang will inevitably increase, and the market has a tight phenomenon. The association allocated the market, and the transactions were on the three or four days, initially rising and then loosening, and the results were good, ranging from a few cents to each other. The current rough white of 24 is $59.50 to $0.30 in the native stacks, $60.085 to $60 in the newly arrived goods outside the stacks, $60 to $59 in the old goods, the original price of transshipment goods has not changed, the Taikoo Chebai B mark Dong stack once reached $60.02, the price was $59.5 to $9, the West stack was allocated $61 to $60.5 on the 3rd, and yesterday it was $60.5, the CW mark was $60, the CX mark was $59.8, the DY mark was $59.5, the Dong stack was $59.3, the HX mark West stack was $59.5, the Dong stack was $59, and the H mark Che Chi was $44, the Dutch Chi MP mark was $46, and the WA mark was $45.5, all loose half a dollar, the original cotton white No. 1 once reached $60, yesterday it was $59.5, No. Bing was $71 on the 3rd, and yesterday it was $70.5, Jingming Bing was $72.5 to $72.

Spring and Autumn

### New Year's Day on the Street

— Liu Lan

It's a day with good sunshine, and there's a warm smile on the faces of pedestrians! The bustling city is even more bustling, and it's lively everywhere. The streets seem so narrow that there's really only room to stick a foot in, and turning around is awkward. So people bump into each other, people and people.

The national flag on the pole is solemnly silent. A gust of wind comes and it shakes, flying. It is very energetic.

What will this new year bring? Guess. (The secret cannot be revealed, and the answer can be revealed next year?)

And people welcome it with mad enjoyment.

Nowadays, movie theaters don't pull down iron gates anymore; a sign: House Full. Dance halls, restaurants... there will be no exceptions.

Originally, what's superfluous are colorful pieces of paper and leisure. What else are some residents of this city doing if they don't play and have fun? It's really a waste to persuade and sigh with heartfelt intentions. In the midst of the loud laughter, do you want to remind the people present of the wailing of those who have lost their homes? Couples dance in the magnificent and splendid mansion, who will care about how many houses have been burned down? I am reminded of an old saying. Playing the lute to a cow. First of all, they have to find the lost conscience.

A car sped past, leaving behind many colorful small pieces of paper. People swarmed forward: snatching, grabbing, picking up. But after getting it, they spit on it and tore it apart. It turned out that they were printed with some nonsensical nonsense. Many small pieces of paper flew like butterflies, trampled on the ground by people. No one paid any attention anymore.

Turning a corner, and then turning another corner, I walked on an unfamiliar street with a long, strange name. Suddenly, there was a red slip of paper on the glass window, and two lines of black characters came into my eyes: "This store is closed for business, and the means of making money is for sale." I discovered a secret, and I thought of the dying embers of those who were about to enter the tomb. This deformed prosperity is only a flash in the pan after all. But where will those people who turned somersaults on the competitive stage and pawned off their livelihoods go to seek their own luck?

### The Voices of a Group of Elementary School Teachers

In previous issues of this publication, several articles such as "Appeals from Elementary School Teachers" and "Improving the Treatment of Elementary School Teachers" were published. However, the first letter received at the newspaper office yesterday was a complaint from a group of elementary school teachers. With the price of rice soaring to over forty dollars per dan (a unit of dry measure), the lives of elementary school teachers are truly miserable. Furthermore, after the winter vacation, schools are using the excuse of "enormous expenses" to increase tuition fees. Therefore, we hope that the principals of various schools will consider the appeals of elementary school teachers within the realm of possibility.
— Editor

"Rice at forty dollars a shi (a unit of dry measure), it's killing us!"
— A Teacher

"Sir: Here, the lives of us teachers are not even as good as the school workers! The school workers' meals are provided by the school, but not for us. In addition to meals, the school workers also receive five dollars in salary, while our monthly meal expenses exceed our limited monthly salaries. Therefore, if we want to continue living, we must take out our own money to buy food. But where does the money come from?"
— Luo Ping

"My monthly living expenses are as follows: rent fifteen dollars, food thirty-five dollars, children's snacks three dollars, transportation five dollars, spending money two dollars, totaling sixty dollars. My monthly income is forty dollars, which is twenty dollars short. There is no money for even basic entertainment, medical care, or new clothes."
— Bi Shan

"Amidst the soaring rice prices, besides the hardships of the lower classes, elementary school teachers are among those suffering the most. Our monthly income is only forty dollars, how can a family of seven survive? Just buying rice alone costs over forty dollars. Sir, it means that even living in the open air and eating raw rice is not enough!"
— Shu Sheng

"Dear Sir: Would you believe that I, a teacher at a school, have to beg a dollar from a friend to buy two sheng (a unit of dry measure) of rice from the rice shop – and it's only two sheng!"
— Feng

"Now, breakfast is porridge, lunch is noodles, and dinner is porridge, which has become the new rule. Everyone can still endure it, but the crying of two children after 4 p.m. for 'hunger' has dried up my wife's tears."
— Chang Shi

"Who would believe that my family, because the salary has not arrived and there is no way to borrow money, has had two days where each person only ate a bowl of plain noodles!"
— Ying

"I am living in a state of semi-starvation!"
— Lü Ping

"With an average daily salary of seventy cents, what do you think one can eat? What can one buy?"
— Han Mei

"I heard that a tour guide charges one dollar per hour, but I only get twenty cents per hour for teaching classes. In fact, I have a friend who even envies my income, thinking it is better than his! I really don't understand!"
— Hu Tu

"Daddy! Why hasn't the rice shop delivered rice? You've been lying to me for three days!"—I plan to keep lying to him for a few more days! Until January 31st.
— Shi Qin

"I don't want to lament about suffering, so I will offer four suggestions:

(1) Please stand on the position of the nation, and provide living support based on the increase in prices.

(2) Improve treatment to enhance the quality of education.

(3) Teachers should unite to strive for the authorities' awareness and the realization of democracy.

(4) The Shanghai education authorities should broadly discuss the issue of improving teachers' treatment."
— Zhen

Chapter Nineteen: Watching Flowers and Appreciating the Moon, Activities Complete the Family; Planting Jade Pearls, Pregnancy Achieved with Skill

Zhu Ai-ren went to visit Doctor Tang today, but she did not visit her at the hospital, but rather at her home. Why? Because today is Sunday, and she knew that Doctor Tang would definitely be at home. This Doctor Tang, named Tang Hui-zhen, is from Guangdong. She is a Christian and is much older than Zhu Ai-ren, being thirty-seven years old this year. However, she has never married and remains chaste. Being a woman herself, and also studying gynecology, she has a very thorough understanding of women's physiology and pathology. When Zhu Ai-ren arrived at her house, it was about ten o'clock in the morning. She was at home, having just returned from attending a service at a church near the hospital. Upon seeing Zhu Ai-ren, she was very welcoming and said, "Sister Ai-ren, it's been a long time! I heard you're very busy at the hospital and also managing the orphanage. When did you come to Shanghai?" Zhu Ai-ren said, "I came yesterday afternoon. Because I don't come to Shanghai often, I must visit old classmates. This time, you'll never guess, I came to attend a wedding banquet, a little sister's wedding. You could say it's a leisure trip, right?" Tang Hui-zhen said, "Just for a wedding banquet? Or is there something else? How is Doctor Zhang? I miss you very much. People all say that you and him are running the hospital and orphanage in Anle Town very well. I've wanted to come and see you and greet Doctor Zhang. But I'm tied down by my duties and can't be free. You said you're attending a wedding banquet, whose is it? You rarely come to Shanghai, so you'll probably stay for a few days, right?" Zhu Ai-ren told her it was Jin Dan-yun's wedding, whom she didn't really know. She also said, "I'll stay for two or three days and then go back. After I left, Doctor Zhang is taking over my duties." Then she asked, "Do you see Sister Yu Pei-fen often? I'd like to visit her too, but I don't know if she's home today, being Sunday." Tang Hui-zhen said, "She came by once two weeks ago. The two of them, husband and wife, support a hospital, which is to their credit. Although their hospital is small, the location is very good. I've been there a few times. There's a garden inside, which is very exquisite. Their house is separate, and they live there. I say their hospital is like a sanatorium in format. They don't accept patients with acute infectious diseases that require strict isolation. Fortunately, there's another infectious disease hospital in Jiangwan, so there's no problem. Her husband is a bacteriology expert, a scholar. Sister Pei-fen manages everything else in the hospital, so she's very busy too." (223)

### Comments on a Letter from Apprentices Exposing Dark Secrets

— Qiang Gong

A few days ago, I saw a letter from a rice shop apprentice exposing the dark secrets of the rice shop, and then I saw a letter from a cotton cloth shop apprentice exposing the dark secrets of the cotton cloth shop. The layers of darkness, especially in Shanghai, are a problem worthy of attention.

Apprentices have not experienced much of the world, and when they find themselves in a dark society, their pure conscience is stimulated, and they issue a cry against the darkness. This can prove the harvest and success of a part of elementary education in China in recent years. We see apprentices speaking out righteously, but we do not see shop assistants exposing the truth; this is enough to prove that the depth of worldly experience determines the rationality and correctness of behavior. However, today's apprentices are tomorrow's shop assistants. While the apprentices have not been deeply infected, I cannot but say a word to encourage their ambition.

Let me put it in very simple terms. The so-called "training apprentices" is when businesses take young children into the shop to teach them reading, arithmetic, and matters related to the business of the shop, which is what Shanghai commonly calls "learning business." Although it is said that "an apprentice" is there to "learn business," to use the name of "business" to seek improper behavior, to learn business and become evil, is not only a sign of commercial decline, but also not the original intention of parents sending their children to "learn business." This time, the rice shop apprentice made a complaint first, and the cotton cloth shop apprentice revealed secrets later. They are two bright stars among the apprentices, and they both know that this "is not the way of business."

If it is "business," the apprentice should "learn" it, which is called "staying if it fits." If it is not "business," the apprentice should "withdraw bravely," which is called "leaving if it doesn't fit." If it "doesn't fit" with one's learning business and one "leaves," then one is finding the bright path that "fits" with one's "learning business."

Among apprentices in the industrial and commercial sectors, and in factories and companies, there are many that "fit," but there are also many that "don't fit." If apprentices do not make a clear distinction between staying and leaving at this time, but want to rely on merchants who create dark secrets for food, it is contemptible!

At the beginning of this year, I hope that the apprentices will follow their conscience, their position of "learning business," and be good apprentices. As the saying goes, "The past is gone, the future can be pursued," please start from today.

The Entertainment World

### Shirley Temple Will Leave the Film Industry

— Fu

Shirley Temple, the Hollywood child star, is very lively and lovely, with an innocent childhood appearance. She also has golden hair and blue eyes, and she is already twelve years old this year. At the age of three, she jumped onto the screen, starring in short films. She is a powerful talent of the Fox Company. In the past five or six years, she has acted in more than twenty films. The public screening of each new film is very profitable, so the company attaches special importance to her and treats her as a cash cow.

Most of the film titles she has acted in are prefixed with the word "Little," such as "Little Miss Marker," "Little Miss Broadway," "Little Colonel," "Little General," "Little Rebel," "Little Annie Rooney," "Little Princess," and "The Little Orphan" which recently premiered in Shanghai. The performance of the films has been specially praised by the audience. Following "The Little Orphan," she starred in "The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer." Her style in that film is different from previous films and creates a new style, fully presenting the demeanor of a young girl. The film has been completed and will be released soon.

Currently, she is filming "The Blue Bird," which is consistent with the style of "The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer." It is said that after she completes this film, she will leave the film industry and bid farewell to the audience on the screen, and concentrate on going to school. The reason why she doesn't want to act in films anymore is because she is gradually getting older, her childhood innocence has been lost, and her voice is also changing. The conditions for a child star to act in films are obviously not suitable. She knows that her appeal on the screen will decline in the future, and the audience may feel disgusted. Therefore, retiring first is a wise move!

### The Establishment of Chinese New Opera: From Changsha to Guilin – An Introduction to the Peking Opera Experimental Troupe

— A Traveling Reporter

Before and after the great fire in Changsha, a group of young men and women were active in the towns, trenches, and villages under the artillery fire. That was the "Peking Opera Experimental Troupe" led by Tian Han.

As Wang Pingling said, "The enthusiasm of the nation has eliminated all small personal prejudices. The Peking Opera world, which has always been considered to be stagnant in the feudal conservative stage, has now been awakened by the tide of the times, and has unanimously realized that it is doing its job."

The excellent achievements of the "Peking Opera Experimental Troupe" established Chinese new opera. In order to meet the needs of the environment, Tian Han changed it to one of the branches of the "Peking Opera Propaganda Team." He created the scripts himself, full of patriotic enthusiasm. With the great Peking Opera techniques, millions of people have been moved by this iron army of new opera over the past year.

From Changsha to Guangzhou, Guilin, and Nanning, many newspapers competed to publish the glory of their work. In particular, every city they passed through, "Ping Xuan" (Peking Opera Propaganda Team) specially printed many portraits of welcomers, and the number of members also increased day by day. The blood-deep anger of farmers, workers, soldiers, and young students, "Ping Xuan" is an engine for mobilization.

The scripts, props, and makeup have all been changed. The old tune of putting new wine in old bottles is originally the evasion of the weak. The Peking Opera of "Ping Xuan" has been essentially reformed, but with new content combined with the art of Peking Opera, however, it has therefore penetrated the folk and achieved unprecedented success.

Having read Zhou Xinfang's article "Reforming Old Operas" twice, I like it very much. Here is a brief introduction to the recent situation of "Ping Xuan," hoping that Mr. Zhou can firmly work hard to realize the Peking Opera reform as soon as possible, and that the Peking Opera workers in Shanghai will also unite to fight for their future.

New Year's Special Dispatch

### Tang Ruoqing Went to Hong Kong the Other Day; Lu Ming's Contract with Yi Hua Has Expired; In Early Spring, She Will Also Go to Hong Kong to Film

— Hua

"China Travel" performed five days of free shows of "Resurrection" last year, and decided to officially perform Wei Ruohui's "Empress Dowager Cixi" starting from New Year's Day, but because of the time required for the clothing, props, reference, and preparation of the Qing Dynasty, Wu Yonggang's "Lin Chong Flees at Night" was temporarily changed. "Empress Dowager Cixi" was actively rehearsed, preparing to be staged after "Lin Chong Flees at Night." However, in order to contact a part of the old members of "China Travel" left in Hong Kong, and all the scenery and props, someone needs to go to negotiate, so Tang Ruoqing hurriedly went to Hong Kong the other day. Tang Ruoqing is the Empress Dowager Cixi in "Empress Dowager Cixi," and in this round trip, the drama work cannot proceed according to the original procedure, so after "Lin Chong Flees at Night," other dramas will probably be temporarily changed again.

Lu Ming's contract with Yi Hua Company expired at the end of 1939, so the issue of renewal has been under negotiation between the two parties for several months. But unfortunately, starting from January 1, 1940, Lu Ming finally left Yi Hua. As for Lu Ming's future, it is not what the outside world has said that she will go to Guohua Company to film. Her future is in Hong Kong. When the spring breeze sends warmth, Lu Ming will set off for Hong Kong. Chen Kengran and Xu Qin芳 will restore the Youlian Company (or change another name), film themselves, and plan that the first film is "The Sad Story of Liang Zhu."

The Shanghai Suzhou Christian Church Zhabei Hall Choir and Orchestra are scheduled to hold a church foundation music concert at Tian'an Church on Shandong Road at 8 p.m. on the 6th of this month (Saturday), and invite famous musicians such as Prof. V. G. Shushlln, Mr. Leo Itkis, and Mr. Adler to participate in solo performances. Most of the tickets have been sold, but they can also be purchased at the entrance at that time, which is a good opportunity for music lovers.

### Blackout Dance

— JT

Since the outbreak of the European War, all countries have adopted blackouts to prevent enemy night attacks, so as to avoid disasters in cities. The owner of a certain dance hall in Paris, in view of this, came up with a novel idea and invented a new type of dance, which is beautifully called "Blackout Dance." The method is that when the guests are in the midst of dancing, all the lights in the venue are suddenly turned off. At this time, the dancers must exchange partners in the dark and dance. When the lights are turned back on, each couple of dancers does not know each other, and they laugh and exchange back to their original dance partners and dance again. It is heard that the dance hall owner who invented the "Blackout Dance" told others that the biggest intention of inventing this kind of dance is to make the soldiers participating in the war in France get to know their dance partners more. The above information was seen in a certain Western magazine, and I translated the general idea to tell the readers of the entertainment world.

Anecdotes of the Shouhu Studio

### The Origins of Sun Zuochen's Four Erhus (Part One)

— Lin Shaoqing

Sun Zuochen's erhu skills have the reputation of being sacred. In the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, for fifty years, he stood side by side with Mei Yutian and Chen Yanheng. After the death of the three, there was no successor. Every time I think of it, I feel heartbroken! In the past, Jiao Tong and Lü Yi's qins were famous in previous generations. The large and small Hulei instruments were hidden in the Liu family (in the Tang Palace, there were musical instruments named Hulei, one large and one small, shaped like the pipa but smaller, covered with snake skin. After several wars, they were lost and regained, separated and reunited. This was seen in the records of previous people. Liu Gonglu of Guichi had these two items in his collection, and once showed them, saying that they were relics of the Tang Dynasty. There was a special publication to preface the matter, but now I don't know if they still exist!). Sun's four qins, although valued in modern times, are not the same as those of ancient times, but they are of recordable value. Moreover, I have personally seen and stroked all four of these qins, and one of them is now in my hand, so I must record it.

Now, for the convenience of my explanation and to cherish Sun's remaining qin, I will name each of Sun's remaining qin according to their different shapes and sounds. One is called Luohan, the second is called Shouhe, the third is called Danfeng, and the fourth is called Xin. The erhu is an instrument used in popular music, and there is no practice of giving it a special name. It is only because there are few people in the world who like to do good things and do not know the true value that this is the case (the remaining musical instruments of Western musicians are regarded as treasures by the world, and they are named after the person. Their value exceeds tens of thousands of pounds). I am now creating a special name to make the world know that musicians are valuable, and that the qin played by Sun is precious. Now I will describe the origins of the four qins: The Luohan qin is made of Luohan bamboo for the qin's rod (the qin's body is called the rod, also known as the danzi, like the spine of a person). Bamboo that is multi-segmented and solid is called Luohan bamboo. It is the best for making qin rods. It is difficult to find good material. It is not seen in one out of ten thousand qins. Sun happened to get it by chance. When Sun was young, he happened to visit outside Xizhi Gate and saw this broken old qin for sale on the ground by the roadside, covered with dust. Knowing that it was good, he bought it for eight hundred wen. When he returned and tried to play it, the sound was better than ordinary products, and his fame relied on it to be established. Sun often said that he got this qin just like a general got a treasured sword and a fine horse (this Luohan qin was once damaged due to carelessness, and could not make a sound for three months. Sun did not eat or sleep for it. Later, he hired a good craftsman to repair it, and it began to sound again, but the sound was not as good as before).
