### The Sino-Japanese Commercial and Navigation Treaty Expires: The U.S.-Japan Relationship Reaches a Critical Stage; The United States Firmly Maintains the Open Door Policy in the Far East; If Japan Does Not Realize Its Mistakes, Sanctions May Be Imposed at Any Time

WASHINGTON - The U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation has been abolished, and there is currently no sign of signing a transitional agreement. Congress has now decided to hand this case over to the State Department. According to the U.S. State Department, the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty was abolished at midnight today (1:00 PM Saturday Shanghai time), while the Japanese side believes that the treaty was abolished at midnight Tokyo time on Friday (10:00 AM this morning). Whitelem, a representative of the Democratic Party in New York, said, "Unless there are no more unexpected events, the United States will never consider signing a new treaty." Democratic Senator Glen also told a Japanese reporter via a long-distance Pacific telephone call, "Negotiations for a new treaty will be suspended because the American public is extremely angry about Japan's infringement of the interests of American expatriates in China." (United Press dispatch on the 26th)

WASHINGTON - The expiration of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty has been commented on by diplomatic circles here. It is said that Japan has repeatedly tried to sign at least a temporary agreement with the United States, but to no avail. Once the treaty expires at midnight today, the relationship between the United States and Japan will enter a new stage. Although the current situation cannot be said to change drastically after the two countries enter a state of no treaty, the United States is actually in a superior position and can effectively exert pressure on Japan at any time. The U.S. government's attitude towards Japan has been very firm in recent months. It is generally believed that this is an expression of the U.S. determination to refuse to recognize the "New Order in East Asia." However, in reality, the U.S. attitude has remained consistent since the Manchurian Incident in 1931. In other words, it (1) maintains the Open Door Policy; (2) refuses to recognize all Japanese conquests or annexations, regardless of the form they take; and (3) maintains the integrity of U.S. rights in the Far East. To this day, State Department leaders still believe that Japanese public opinion does not have a correct understanding of U.S. views, which has led to politics still being controlled by the military. It is hoped that public opinion will realize this in time and prompt the Japanese government to change its course. Then the United States is still willing to take a compromising attitude. As for the Japanese government's insistence on going its own way and heading towards suicide, the U.S. government will consider various measures, the nature of which is equivalent to retaliatory measures, and the form of which is no more than the following two types: (1) Banning the transportation of munitions and certain items to Japan. Regarding this, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman has already drafted a bill that will be submitted to the Senate for discussion. (2) Imposing additional taxes on Japanese imports, which may be increased to 45%. Since the outbreak of the war in Europe, German exports have been blockaded, and all production in the British Empire must be reserved for its own use. Japan's reliance on U.S. supplies is increasing, especially for various raw materials necessary for combat. In addition, Japan's financial situation is extremely unstable. It only maintains its currency with the proceeds from selling silk to the United States. Therefore, if the United States puts commercial pressure on Japan, it will be very effective. However, for the time being, the U.S. government does not intend to change the status quo. When Congress discusses the Pittman embargo bill in the future, the State Department does not intend to put pressure on it, but would rather allow Congress and domestic public opinion to freely express their views.

WASHINGTON - The U.S.-Japan commercial treaty has expired. This treaty was signed in Washington in 1911 and has been in effect for 29 years. According to the treaty, in addition to both parties enjoying most-favored-nation treatment, citizens of the signatory countries may travel, reside, and conduct business within the territory of the other country. However, in reality, since the United States promulgated the Immigration Act of 1907, the entry of Japanese immigrants has been almost completely prohibited. However, in terms of commercial relations, the signatory countries are bound by the most-favored-nation clause, and any restrictions on imports and exports that are not universally applicable to other countries may not be imposed on the other party. The reason why the United States has been unable to prohibit the transportation of munitions and other goods to Japan in the past is because of this. Secretary of State Hull decided on July 26 of last year to notify the Japanese government of the abolition of the treaty in accordance with a clause in the treaty that stipulates that if one of the signatory countries wishes to declare the abolition of the treaty, it should give notice six months in advance. This deadline expired at midnight yesterday. Therefore, from today onwards, the U.S. government can freely implement embargo measures against Japan or commercial restrictions that it deems beneficial. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)

The United States Seeks Truth from Facts and Forces Japan to Change Its Policy

WASHINGTON - People here are now observing the expiration of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty with composure. The general attitude is that if the U.S.-Japan trade relationship is not to be placed on a temporary basis starting on Saturday morning, then Tokyo must take the initiative. The impression that the U.S. authorities are seeking truth from facts can now be confirmed by the criticism of the "Washington Post." The newspaper mentioned the expiration of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty today, saying that January 26 will be the starting point of a brand new and important page in the history of U.S.-Japan relations. Japan has repeatedly infringed on U.S. rights and interests in China without any scruples for more than eight years. The State Department has repeatedly protested against various acts of insult and unfriendliness against the United States, but these protests have never had any effect. Now, in accordance with the general demands of the public, the opportunity to stop supplying military supplies to Japan has arrived. If commerce is interfered with by legislation, the Japanese will know best how serious the damage will be to Japan. Whether the United States will adopt a retaliatory plan to deal with Japan depends solely on Japan's actions in the Far East. At the same time, the "Evening Star" also published the same candid remarks, saying that the Japanese government knew long ago what it had to do to restore the United States' desire to conclude a commercial treaty with Japan. In other words, Japan must restrain itself to change its behavior in China, and the United States will judge it by its actions, not its words. January 26 is a turning point in U.S.-Japan relations, but there is no doubt that only a fundamental change in Japanese policy in terms of psychology and spirit can produce beneficial results. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)

WASHINGTON - On the eve of the termination of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty of 1911, American newspapers declared that Japan's actions in the Far East will determine whether the United States will take retaliatory commercial measures. The "New York Journal" stated, "We will maintain the threat of economic pressure to deal with the Tokyo government until the Sino-Japanese war issue can be resolved satisfactorily. Japan cannot, on the one hand, transform the Far East by force and, on the other hand, maintain good relations with the United States and let it act recklessly. The United States must at least sever partial commercial relations with Tokyo." The "New York Sun" stated, "It is still difficult to say whether the State Department's attitude towards Japan will improve or deteriorate in the future. Enlightened people in the United States all agree with the firm position taken by the government on this matter. If the Japanese army, which rules Japan, thinks that the State Department is bluffing or disregards the price (of our notification of the abolition of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty of 1911), then all the blame will be on them." (United Press dispatch on the 26th)

Chongqing Newspapers Eagerly Await Further Action by the United States

CHONGQING - This morning, all the newspapers here carried editorials discussing the great significance of the expiration of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty today. The "Central Daily News" stated that prohibiting the transportation of materials to Japan is the most effective way to curb Japanese aggression against China. This move will surely win the sympathy of the majority of the American people. Sao Dang Bao hopes that the government will abide by the policy of abolishing the treaty and not be moved by Japan's superficial appeasement plans. The "Shishi Xinbao" stated that from today onwards, the U.S. government has adopted an effective plan to curb Japan's expansionist forces in the Far East. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)

Japan's Economic Lifeline Is in the Hands of the United States

WASHINGTON - Commerce Secretary Hopkins today issued a long article on U.S.-Japan trade on the day the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty expires. Readers attach great importance to it. The article clearly reveals Japan's dependence on the United States, regarding the United States as a market for selling Japanese goods and as a source of necessary military supplies, especially after the war in Europe disrupted Japan's trade with Europe. In other words, the article indicates that if any development causes obstacles to Japan's normal trade with the United States, then Japan will realize how difficult the situation is. The article traces that in recent years, Japan has ranked third in U.S. trade, both in buying and selling. Japan accounts for 7% of U.S. imports and 8% of U.S. exports. Of Japan's total imports, 34% come from the United States, and of Japan's total exports, 16% to 20% are sold to the United States. It is found that Japan's exports within the Japanese Yen bloc (that is, trade that cannot absorb foreign currency) account for about 40% to 50% of its total. Therefore, Japan's exports to the United States are an important source of foreign currency needed by Japan to purchase raw materials. The United States supplies Japan with about 56% of the important necessities for its heavy industry, 40% of raw cotton, 40% of metals, 50% of machinery, and 65% of petroleum. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)

WASHINGTON - Republican Congressman Hamilton said today that the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty has now expired, which is a major blow to cotton planters in the United States, as the current situation of cotton planters in the United States is already extremely dire. He also said that since the United States has such a surplus of cotton, it should no longer care about nationality and market price and try to dispose of it. (United Press dispatch on the 26th)

A Drastic Change Is Expected in the Financial Relationship Between the Two Countries

WASHINGTON - According to financial experts here today, from today onwards, not only has the commercial relationship between the United States and Japan entered a "day-to-day" state, but also its financial relationship has entered a "day-to-day" state. If the amount of Japanese goods purchased by the United States in the future is still large, then the basic financial relationship between the two countries will not change. However, everything is uncertain, because the main commodity for Japan to obtain U.S. foreign exchange is raw silk. If the United States purchases less Japanese raw silk, then a drastic change will occur in the U.S.-Japan financial relationship. (United Press dispatch on the 26th)

TOKYO - Japanese newspapers unanimously criticized and condemned the United States for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty and demanded that Japan's attitude towards the United States be hardened. "Kokumin Shimbun" said, "The United States' failure to sign a new treaty with Japan is an extremely unfriendly act. Japan will not be responsible for any disputes in the future."

Editorial

### How Will the United States Act Against Japan?

The Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty, at 12:00 midnight on January 26, 1940, truly, as expected six months ago, ended its mission of twenty-nine years, losing its binding power on the contracting states. Only because of the vast spatial distance, the times between East and West diverged, so that after 10:00 PM on the 26th in Shanghai, the Japanese side regarded the commercial treaty as already abolished, but until 11:00 AM on the 27th in Shanghai, the American side still had to regard this treaty as existing. When the reporter writes here, it is actually between this existence and that abolition; if Chinese characters discuss matters and record time, and must strictly distinguish between past, present, or future, then it is unknown how to use words appropriately. Fortunately, although Japan yearns to maintain the original treaty or replace it with a temporary agreement, the strong and clear attitude of the United States has become even greater from eight years, six months to the recent days; it is known that before 11:00 AM this morning, there is no need to worry about any sudden changes, because the entry of the United States and Japan into a state of no treaty is indeed a predetermined situation, which is worthy of being a premise before the establishment of a theory.

The policies and measures of a democratic country must be based on popular sentiment; however, from general emotions, through the various promotions of newspapers, magazines, speeches, and broadcasts, to the decisions of the parliament and the announcements of the authorities, there are inevitable detours in space and time, and there are also possible setbacks. Therefore, according to dispatches from Washington, it is said that the United States will deal with Japan in the future in no more than two ways: (1) banning the transportation of munitions and certain items to Japan; (2) imposing additional taxes on Japanese imported goods; but which one of these two ways will ultimately be taken? Is it no more than these two ways? When will the first way be taken? These are all questions; moreover, whether to adopt any action can also be a fundamental question. The truth is that where detours and setbacks lie, it is not appropriate to judge rashly until the authorities announce and implement it. Moreover, the severity of the American actions revealed by public opinion must not be limited to the above two ways. Tracing back to after the September 18th Incident in 1931, although American policy has been able to consistently maintain its spirit and arguments, various opinions have been uneven and extremely disparate, thus forming a situation of inaction and contradiction over the past eight or nine years. Finally, because of the protracted resistance of China, the general American people were given time to calmly recognize the Far East problem, accumulating the lessons of suffering contempt, insult, and infringement; therefore, the sentiment of sanctioning violence gradually matured and water flowed to form a channel, and the aggressors have recently come to be seen as having reached the point of being full of evil. Comprehensively considering recent American sentiment, in a negative aspect, there is no longer talk of fearing Japan's retaliation and avoiding a conflict between the United States and Japan, and those who advocate that the United States not interfere in the Far East. In a positive aspect, it is confirmed that Japan relies on the United States in the economic aspect, so the United States can make effective sanctions in the economic aspect; it is confirmed that Japan's ambitions and actions in the Far East have given the United States a great threat, so the United States must deal with it in time, and not leave regret that it cannot bite its navel; it is confirmed that the Far East New Order flaunted by Japan is actually a strategy to exclude other countries from withdrawing from the Far East, so the United States must wait for the Japanese army to withdraw from China; it is confirmed that between the United States and Japan, not only are there various outstanding cases in the political, diplomatic, and economic aspects, which are obstacles to national relations, so it is expected that Japan will change its policies and ideas in the Far East. Such is the public sentiment, and the consequence of the abolition of the treaty today.

What actions the United States will take after the expiration of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty is not appropriate to judge rashly now; however, there are things that can be asserted, that the American authorities should not be satisfied with the expiration of the commercial treaty and the freedom of action that the United States has obtained against Japan. Because if Japan does not obtain the guarantee of a commercial treaty and can still fully enjoy the same treatment as when the commercial treaty existed, then the abolition of the treaty is completely meaningless, and why go to the trouble of doing this; this is one reason. With the existence of the commercial treaty, Japan can purchase murder weapons in the United States, and although the American authorities have been questioned by various parties, and must not be exempt from the blame of conscience, they have had to tolerate this kind of "legal immoral behavior" due to the constraints of the commercial treaty; since the commercial treaty has been abolished, the United States must know how to correct itself from both legal and moral aspects; this is the second reason. From July 7, 1937 to the present, it has been entirely thanks to the War of Resistance that the overall situation has been supported, otherwise China would have ceased to be a country, and the interests of the United States and other countries in the Far East would have been destroyed long ago; since the United States and China have aligned interests, they should give effective assistance to the War of Resistance, and give effective blows to aggression; after the United States abolishes the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, it should know that without any action, it will not be able to reap the effects of abolishing the treaty; this is the third reason. In the great international disaster, how can the United States force other countries to have Far East policies that must be in line with the United States, just as other countries cannot force the United States to donate its Far East interests and abandon them while marching in parallel with them; there is a sequence of events, and the situation has its ups and downs, and the United States must know that only by taking the lead in acting righteously and bravely, will other countries no longer be afraid, no longer compromise, and only look to the United States to lead the way, and follow as one; this is the fourth reason. That warmongers impoverish the people and exhaust the army is indeed a fact, but history shows that China has exhausted its wealth to make a desperate gamble, or has acted perversely against other countries in the hope of perishing together, which is possible under the state of being crazy in psychology; then, with the power of a thousand jun, controlling the opportunity first, matters cannot be handled without the United States, and the United States has an unshirkable duty; this is the fifth reason. For these five reasons, although we cannot predict how the United States will act, that it will surely do something is something to be watched with new eyes.

### Military Situation in Southern Shanxi Becomes Deadlocked; Fighting in the Southeast Is Still Fierce

LUOYANG - The war situation in southern Shanxi has been relatively quiet in recent days due to snow. It is reported that the Japanese troops southeast of Wenxi have increased slightly. The Japanese are still trapped in various places such as Zhenfeng Pagoda and Old Temple, and the Chinese and Japanese forces are in a state of deadlock. The number of Japanese troops in Yicheng, Fushan, and other places is also gradually increasing, and the Chinese army is actively attacking. The war situation in the Shangdang District in southeastern Shanxi seems to be more intense. More than 10,000 Japanese troops in Huguan launched a full-scale invasion of Gaoping on the 13th, and their momentum was quite rampant. The Chinese army advanced step by step, fought hard to intercept, and dealt heavy blows. Especially in the battle of Xihuo Town (east of Yincheng), they charged back and forth and annihilated more than 1,000 Japanese troops, creating a glorious victory. Later, the Japanese army received reinforcements and continued to advance south.

### The Course of the Victory in Northern Hubei: Japanese Attempt to Seize the Tongbai Mountains in an Effort to Completely Control Their Advantage and Crush China

Chongqing – Over the past week, the Chinese army in the Tongbai Mountain area north of the Yangtze River has unveiled the most rapid and fierce annihilation battle. In this battle, the Chinese army, with an iron-like attitude, defeated the main force of the Japanese army and crushed their long-prepared vicious attempt. Regarding the annihilation of the Japanese, a certain military spokesperson told a Central News Agency reporter that the Japanese army, entrenched in Changtaiguan, Xinyang, Wushengguan and other places, was constantly subjected to fierce attacks by the Chinese troops in the Tongbai Mountain area. They planned to transfer more than 10,000 infantry, cavalry, and artillery from Xiaogan and Huangpi, and join the Japanese troops in Yingshan and Suixian to invade Yinjia Dian and Gao Cheng in an attempt to seize Tongbai Mountain in one fell swoop, in order to eliminate the threat to Changxin and other places. Certain Chinese troops calmly deployed and lured the Japanese into the Chinese encirclement, and echoed with the Biyang and Zaoyang allied forces to strike from the side. The Japanese army once penetrated deeply on the 18th, reaching Gu Jia Dian and Gao Cheng. Seeing that the time was ripe, the Chinese army launched a full-scale siege on the 19th, braving the bitter wind and snow. After three days and nights of bloody battles, the main force of the Japanese army was annihilated by the Chinese, and Yinjia Dian and Gao Cheng were recaptured. More than 4,000 Japanese corpses were left behind, and 7,000 to 8,000 were wounded. The Chinese also seized six heavy artillery pieces, more than twenty field artillery pieces, and destroyed more than ten Japanese tanks and more than fifty trucks. The brave men of the Chinese army pursued fiercely, and the Japanese casualties were even greater along the way. The importance of this battle is very significant. First, the Chinese army planned to crush the Japanese attempt and inflict the greatest damage on them. Second, the Chinese army will forever maintain a strong posture and superior terrain to control the Japanese army in the Changxin and Wu areas. (25th telegram)

Fancheng – The Japanese army that broke through from Sui North retreated southeast in two routes. The Chinese army intercepted and attacked along the way, killing many. They are now tracking and pursuing separately. The fighting in the central Hubei area is still ongoing on the Jingzhong Road. On the 24th, more than ten sections of the highway between Guanqiao and Dongqiao were destroyed by the Chinese, and more than 100 kilograms of telegraph wires were seized. At the moment, the Jingzhong Road is completely controlled by the Chinese army. (25th telegram)

Xiangyang – The Japanese army that was defeated by the Chinese army near Gao Cheng retreated south on the 22nd. The Chinese army tracked and pursued, and divided into routes to intercept at Houzi Wan, Yuanjia Wan, Xujia Wan, Wanjiadian, Ta'er Wan and other places. After fierce fighting until the morning of the 23rd, all these places were reported to have been recaptured. The Japanese army collapsed step by step, still trapped in heavy encirclement. The various Chinese armies continued to advance bravely, fiercely attacking, and killing more than 3,500 Japanese soldiers by 11 o'clock in the evening. The Japanese army completely lost its will to fight and broke through in different directions to escape. One part fled to Suixian Xihe and other places, and another part fled to Yu Jia Dian. At the moment, the Chinese army is still pursuing closely in separate directions. (25th telegram)

Shashi – The Chinese army advanced towards Guangshui on the 19th, and when it approached the suburbs, it fought the Japanese for three hours, killing many Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army was unable to support and retreated into the town, relying on fortifications to hold on. Soon, the Chinese army destroyed more than 3,000 meters of railway near Yangjiazhai, cutting off the Japanese retreat. At the moment, they are still attacking the town fiercely. (26th telegram)

### Monks, etc. Not Allowed to be Exempted from Military Service

Chongqing – Today, all Chinese newspapers here published an official announcement from the Ministry of Military Administration, stating that since the current Conscription Law does not have provisions for exemption from military service for Buddhist monks, Catholic priests, and Christian pastors, they will not be allowed to be exempted from military service. It is said that since the implementation of national conscription, monks, priests, and pastors have claimed exemption from military service. The local authorities were unable to make a decision on this matter and submitted a request to the government for a final judgment. (26th Reuters telegram)

### Japanese Malicious Propaganda Aims to Harm the American Ambassador

Chongqing – Regarding the Shanghai Japanese military spokesperson's claim that the Chinese side's plot to sink the American ambassador's ship "Luzon" has been discovered, the Chinese side here believes that this is the Japanese side's confession of deliberately sinking the "Luzon." Because the US-Japan Commercial Treaty has now expired, anti-American sentiment is extremely high, so they plan to sink the "Luzon" to vent their anger. Moreover, this type of action is not without precedent, such as the sinking of the American gunboat "Panay," the attack on the British gunboat "Ladybird," and the British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, being strafed by Japanese aircraft, are all good examples. As for their accusation that the Chinese side has this plan, it is nothing more than trying to shirk responsibility. At the same time, the American Embassy here also believes that there is absolutely no knowledge of this plot. (26th United Press telegram)

### The Chinese Army is Active on the Ping-Sui Line: Pingdiquan Station is Attacked and Bao Tou is Besieged Again by Chinese Forces

Xingji – The Chinese army on the Ping-Sui Line is extremely active. Pingdiquan Station was attacked by the Chinese army on the morning of the 17th, and suffered great damage. The Chinese army in Daqingshan also took the opportunity to attack. On the morning of the 18th, they first destroyed the Chasuqi Station, and then dismantled several miles of railway near Bikqi. The Ping-Sui transportation has now been interrupted. More than 10,000 Chinese troops in the Sui Fourth Route advanced in separate directions. One part arrived at Subente, and the main force drove east from the south. The vanguard was only four miles away from Baotou. Another part arrived at Lisha and attacked Nanyang Yang near Baotou. Another part of the Chinese army actively advanced towards Baobei, changing to attack and capture Xincheng. At the moment, Baotou has been besieged again by the Chinese army, and the battle situation is progressing fiercely. (25th telegram)

### Wang Jingwei and Liang Hongzhi Will Issue a Declaration

Qingdao – Wang Jingwei issued a public statement yesterday, saying that all the important issues raised at the meeting here have been resolved. Wang, Wang Kemin, and Liang Hongzhi will issue a declaration tomorrow. After Wang reports on the situation of the Sino-Japanese negotiations, a decision will be made to convene another meeting. (26th Reuters telegram)

Qingdao – Lieutenant Colonel Mabuchi, an official spokesperson for the Japanese, told reporters yesterday that although the meeting will continue, most of the important issues have already been decided. Wang Jingwei has now obtained undeniable evidence that another meeting to be held in the future will be quite promising. The "Central Political Conference" will be convened as soon as possible. Personnel from the "Provisional" and "Reformed" governments, influential figures from the outside world, and even members of the "Old Kuomintang" will be invited to participate in order to help organize the "New Government." Someone asked where the "New Government" will be located, whether it will be in Nanjing. The spokesperson replied, "The location of the 'New Government' is not difficult to imagine," but it is not appropriate to decide on this issue at the current meeting. Regarding the issue of the new national flag, there is much controversy. The "New Government" will continue to use the Kuomintang's Blue Sky White Sun flag, but this matter has been discussed, and even some Japanese oppose it, because the Kuomintang flag has been a symbol of hostility and opposition to Japan's purposes in China. The spokesperson also said that if the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek can abandon cooperation with communism and no longer hate Japan, then not only the Blue Sky White Sun flag, but even the Kuomintang itself, will be adopted. Wang is now trying to promote the true revival of Sun Yat-sen's ideology to rebuild his work. Japan has discovered that some things are the same as its policies, so in the Konoe Declaration of December 20, 1938, there was a passage saying that what Japan desires is not to conquer China, but to seek its cooperation with Japan.

### The "July 7th" Cotton Spinning Machine is Highly Effective

Chongqing – The Agricultural Production Promotion Committee has been promoting the improvement of the "July 7th" cotton spinning machine to various places for the past year and a half in order to alleviate the yarn shortage in the rear, and it has been quite effective. Taking Sichuan as an example, according to a report from the Sichuan Cotton Spinning Machine Promotion Committee, as of the end of November last year, 21,000 "July 7th" cotton spinning machines have been promoted in 84 counties in Sichuan Province. Rural women can spin two pounds of yarn in ten hours of work per machine, earning about one yuan in profit. From a low estimate, 20,000 large bales of yarn can be spun throughout the year, saving 2 million yuan in capital outflow. If electricity or water power is used to drive the machine, each machine can spin three and a half pounds of yarn per day. Moreover, most of the machine is made of wood, so the cost is lower, which is in line with the needs of rural areas. The Agricultural Production Promotion Committee is currently collecting reports from all parties and requesting experts to continue research to improve the machine. (24th telegram)

### The Neutrality of the Netherlands and Belgium is in Fact Fulfilling Their Responsibility to Europe; the Dutch Parliament Debates Churchill's Speech; the Foreign Minister Declares that They Will Resist Any Provocative Actions; the Status of Europe and Asia Does Not Allow Powerful Countries to Sit By and Watch Its Transformation

The Hague – A debate arose during the Dutch Parliament's meeting, criticizing Churchill's broadcast speech last Saturday. The Dutch Foreign Minister, Kleffens, responded that the country is now united in supporting the government's neutrality policy, and the actions taken by the authorities to prevent those who violate neutrality are in complete compliance with international law. The Netherlands' adherence to neutrality is in fact fulfilling its responsibility to Europe, because if the Netherlands and Belgium participate in the war, the European affairs will become even more complicated. If anyone wages war against us, we will respond with force. Recently, someone raised the point that member states of the League of Nations that adhere to neutrality have a legal obligation to participate in the war. In fact, neutral member states have absolutely no legal or moral obligation to participate in the war. If this kind of one-sided remarks continue, it will eventually be difficult for neutral member states to be member states of the League of Nations. However, the time for small and weak countries to withdraw from the League of Nations has not yet arrived, and there is still hope that the League of Nations may change its course. The Netherlands and Belgium have become components of European order and stability. What the Netherlands and Belgium entrust is a well-founded promise and foreign public opinion, that is, the status of the Netherlands in Europe and Asia does not allow any powerful country to sit by and watch its land be transferred to others. Has the time for a fair and wise resolution of European problems not yet arrived? He cannot agree with those who lightly discuss the possibility of neutral countries being attacked.

### German Submarines are Constantly Active, Attacking Ships of Various Countries; French, Turkish, and Swedish Ships Sunk; German Cargo Ship Scuttled After Being Intercepted

Paris – Naval sources say that in the past ten days, the attacks by German submarines on ships of various countries have re-emerged, especially in the North Sea. Ships of various countries, regardless of whether they are warships or merchant ships, and regardless of whether they belong to neutral countries, are subject to indiscriminate attacks. As a result, after the ships are sunk, there is often no trace to be found. In total, since the 18th of this month, in addition to the loss of two British destroyers, no fewer than sixteen ordinary ships of various countries have been torpedoed, but British ships account for only six of them, and there are also two small fishing boats included. German submarines attack ships without issuing a warning in advance, and the torpedoes they launch are very powerful. The ships that are hit often sink within a few minutes. Most of the crew and passengers do not have time to lower the lifeboats and are drowned. Those who are not killed by the explosions either jump into the sea to commit suicide or float on the sea with broken wood. As a result, many also die of cold and starvation. (25th Havas telegram)

### Germany Prepares to Expand the War to Seize the Near East; Iran Denies that Four Countries Have Concluded a Military Alliance

Paris – The Ordre reports that according to sources in neutral countries, Nazi figures in Berlin believe that the war will inevitably be reduced to a war to seize the Near East. They are now preparing to expand military operations in the Caucasus, Iraq, Iran, and Arabia in the near future. The newspaper said that this is a warning to Britain and France. Turkey's friendship has never been more precious than it is today. The Allied governments' actions everywhere must obtain full compromise from the Turkish capital. (26th Reuters telegram)

### Soviet Army Attempts to Outflank the Left Wing of the Mannerheim Line; No Progress for the Soviets on Lake Ladoga; Germany Decides to Maintain Neutrality Towards the Soviet-Finnish War

Helsinki – According to a public statement here today, in the northeast of Lake Ladoga, from Wednesday to Friday morning, the Soviet army attacked the Finnish troops continuously, but until this morning, the Finnish army's position has not been shaken. The purpose of the Soviet army's offensive is to encircle the rear of the Mannerheim Line's left wing. Soviet officers ordered their soldiers to carry out night raids. The Finnish military is quite doubtful about whether the Soviet army has the strength to continue its offensive, and at the same time, they believe that the Soviet army will collapse and be unable to occupy important areas. (26th Havas telegram)

Helsinki – The Finnish and Soviet armies fought fiercely all day yesterday north of Lake Ladoga. According to the latest public statement, the main purpose of the Soviet army's offensive is to flank the Mannerheim Line and defense line, but there has been no progress, because the Soviet army's attacks have been repelled and suffered heavy losses. The fighting in the Aittojoki area was the most fierce yesterday. The Soviet army also began attacking Kollaanjoki intermittently yesterday, and it did not end until night, but it was repelled before dawn. The Soviet army has lost hundreds more people in recent battles. The situation in the Karelian Isthmus is relatively calm. Both sides' activities are limited to reconnaissance and artillery harassment. In the Lapland region, the Soviet army's attack on the Finnish army's position in Mekkajärvi has been repelled. (26th Reuters telegram)

Berlin – Officials here announced last night that Germany has decided to maintain a purely neutral attitude towards the Soviet-Finnish war.

### The "Asama Maru" Incident; Britain Will Reply to Japan's Protest; Explains that Britain's Actions are Legal; Willing to Follow Diplomatic Channels to Resolve the Issue

London – Regarding the Japanese mail ship "Asama Maru" case, well-informed sources here recently announced that the British reply has been sent to the Japanese government by the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie. Its content only explains that Britain's attitude towards this case is justified, but it does not involve how to resolve it, and it will probably be left to Britain and Japan to exchange opinions and seek solutions through diplomatic channels. People in diplomatic circles said that if Japanese shipping companies can agree that they will no longer transport German people of military age in the future, then once the emotions aroused by Japan in this case have eased, the two countries will be able to find a basis for coordination. However, the British government is willing to compromise with Japan not because of reason, but because it wants to avoid tension in British-Japanese relations, and this condition must be that Japan does not assist German interests. In short, Britain will take a firm attitude whenever it involves German interests, even towards neutral countries. Even with the United States, which has always been a friendly country of Britain, Britain has had to reject the requests made by the United States when they violate the interests of Britain and France or international law. This can be seen from the American Continental Security Zone and the American protest against the inspection of mail. Japan should understand this. (25th Havas telegram)

Chongqing – The Chinese Communist Party's mouthpiece, "Xinhua Daily," wrote this morning that the Asama Maru incident is just an excuse for Japan to launch an anti-British movement and force Britain to continue to make concessions in the Far East. Japanese news is working hard to befriend the Soviet Union and the United States, while at the same time trying to cater to the wishes of the Japanese army and will adopt an anti-British policy. Since its failure at Nomonhan, Japan has had to temporarily suspend its expansion to the north and is trying to force Britain to help it resolve the China incident, and will also strengthen its policy of southward expansion. The newspaper predicted that Japan's anti-British movement will continue to increase, and Britain will continue to make concessions. The newspaper warned the Chinese not to expect Britain to help China, and advocated closer relations between China and the Soviet Union. (26th Reuters telegram)

### Tokyo Residents Demonstrate Against Britain; Japanese Military Newspaper Predicts Britain Will Concede

Hong Kong – Tokyo telegram: Due to the "Asama Maru" incident, people from all walks of life in Japan went to the British Embassy to demonstrate and protest to the British side. Thirty representatives from the Tokyo City Council sent a resolution of the council to the First Secretary of the British Ambassador, etc. in the Marunouchi district yesterday. Also, this Wednesday, 100 members of the Japanese Boys' Group went to demonstrate in front of the British Embassy, demanding the return of the German sailors and the removal of British warships near the Sea of Japan. On the same afternoon, 13 representatives of the Newsboy Sports Movement went to the British Embassy to protest. (26th telegram)

Tokyo – "Kokumin Shimbun" wrote a commentary today, attacking the Yonai Cabinet. The newspaper said that the Asama Maru incident was entirely caused by the Yonai Cabinet's pro-British policy. We expect the British side to finally make concessions to Japan so that Prime Minister Yonai can obtain a diplomatic victory, thereby consolidating the position of the pro-British cabinet. This tactic is obviously a conspiracy. (26th United Press telegram)

### Japanese Ships Carrying German Passengers Depart from the United States to Japan

### The Philippines Does Not Fear Invasion; If Anyone Dares to Take the Risk, They Will Suffer a Severe Blow

Manila – According to General MacArthur, the current military advisor to the Philippines and former Chief of Staff of the United States Army, speaking to a reporter from the Manila "Hochi Shimbun," although we believe that no country has the ambition to invade the Philippines, the Philippines will not be difficult to defend itself if another country invades. The Philippines is located at the intersection of Europe and Asia. Merchant ships coming from Europe must pass through or near the Philippines, so the safety of the Philippines is of common concern to major countries. Therefore, if any country dares to risk taking it, it will cause a serious reaction in the world, the nature of which is difficult to predict at present. This is the first point. Secondly, invading the Philippines requires a long-distance sea expedition, which is not easy. In addition, the coast of the Philippines is defensible, so the invasion is extremely dangerous. This is the second point. According to MacArthur, if a country attempts to occupy the Philippine Islands, Britain will have to come out to defend them in order to maintain its imperial routes.

### German Troops Approach Romanian Border: Italian Circles Pay Close Attention to Italy's Balkan and Danube Policies

Rome: The news that German troops have arrived in the Soviet-occupied eastern part of Galicia Province in Poland, approaching the Romanian border, has drawn close attention from all circles in Italy. According to political figures, recent developments may significantly alter Italy's current policies in the Balkan Peninsula and Danube River basin. This is because Germany is now taking advantage of the difficulties encountered by the Soviet Union in Finland and has obtained its consent to send troops to the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, poised to replace the Soviet Union in that position. The impact of this is that Hungary is no longer in direct contact with the Soviet Union. If German troops want to attack Romania, they can directly invade without having to go through Hungary. For this reason, Italy no longer needs to consider both maintaining Hungary's territorial integrity and maintaining Hungary's territorial integrity, as well as maintaining Hungary's political independence from Germany and the Soviet Union. Moreover, since Hungarian independence is no longer secure, Italy's reasons for opposing Soviet threats to Hungary in the future will no longer be as firm as before. There is also no need for Romania and Hungary to establish temporary arrangements. Furthermore, if the Soviet Union occupies Romania's Bessarabia province, while Germany also develops its forces towards the Black Sea through various countries and seizes the oil fields in Romania's Prahova River basin, Hungary's territorial demands on Romania (Romania's Outer Transylvania province belonged to Hungary before the last European war) may be realized. It is held that this matter will inevitably provoke a reaction from Britain and France, and Turkey may also be unable to sit idly by, which must be taken into consideration. (Havas report, 25th)

### US and Japan in Treaty-less State: Commerce Door Half-Closed: Publication of the Course of Negotiations Between Tokyo and Washington: Internal Anxiety and Hope for Renewal of New Treaty

Tokyo: The US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation finally expired at 12:00 PM on January 25. From January 26, it has entered a state of treaty-less relations. The Japanese government, in order to clarify the course of negotiations since the US announced the abandonment of the Treaty of Commerce on the morning of January 26, the Japanese government's attitude towards the state of treaty-less relations, and Japan's views on negotiating a new treaty, issued the following statement through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: On July 26, Showa 14 (1939), the US government, through its ambassador to Japan, notified the Japanese government that the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation concluded in Washington on February 21, Meiji 44 (1911), had points that needed to be newly considered. To open a path for research and to respond to new circumstances, the US requested the termination of the treaty with six months' notice, with the aim of further upholding American interests. However, the US government's intention was nothing more than to use this as a resource for resolving various issues that had arisen between Japan and the US regarding the China Incident. The Japanese government, recognizing the importance of the trade relationship between Japan and the US, and the Japanese government's policy of not excluding the fair and appropriate interests of the US and other third countries in dealing with the current incident, firmly believes in the construction of a "New Order in East Asia" and hopes for its active efforts. Thinking to more thoroughly communicate Japan's position to the US, and to adjust relations between the two countries in a way that suits both parties, Japan continued to make great efforts and to conclude a new treaty, at the very least to prevent the occurrence of a treaty-less state. Although arrangements were made for negotiations related to this, unfortunately, no compromise was reached, so that after the 26th, it entered a state of treaty-less relations. In order to prevent the US-Japan trade relationship from suffering losses, the US Treasury Department and Commerce Department issued orders last year stating that after the treaty's expiration, there would be no collection of ad valorem tax of 10% on goods loaded on Japanese ships, and the Japanese government has no intention of treating American goods and ships differently. Necessary measures have been taken to ensure that the US-Japan trade relationship will not undergo any substantial changes during this treaty-less period. Furthermore, regarding the qualifications recognized by the treaty, the US will treat Japanese nationals residing or traveling to the US as ordinary temporary travelers, but this will not cause any particular obstacles. Based on the above, there is currently no major change in the trade relationship between the two countries. However, the state of treaty-less relations is unstable and is not desired by either Japan or the US. Therefore, the Japanese government will continue the ongoing negotiations in order to restore the normal state of treaty relations between the two countries. (DPA report, 26th)

### Oriental Daily News Commentary: Worries About the Future

Hong Kong: Tokyo dispatch. Today, the US-Japan Commercial Treaty expired. The English-language Japan Times commented that when the commercial treaty was in effect, Japanese merchants in the US had the status of commercial representatives and were protected by the treaty and immigration laws. They could reside in the US and remain in normal business until they were transferred elsewhere. However, their current status is very different from yesterday. They are now treated as ordinary travelers, with their length of stay limited to six months. Although they can apply for an extension every six months, the total time cannot exceed two years. Furthermore, in the absence of a treaty, no traveler can be sure whether they will be allowed to stay for more than six months. Due to the above situation, observers are wondering what actions Japan will take. Some people advocate retaliatory measures, which is very likely. Japanese nationals who have a vested interest in this matter are already in a difficult situation and will inevitably demand retaliation. At the same time, the government's measures must also comply with public opinion. As the US Ambassador said in his speech last October, Japanese residents have already lost their treaty status and can only request a six-month residency permit from the US government. American residents in Japan will also be in the same situation. Foreign residents in Japan were required by the government to register last June, with a term of one year. After the expiration, American and other foreign residents must leave the country unless the government re-approves their stay. At the same time, the same measures will be implemented in Manchuria and other Japanese-occupied areas, etc. Newspapers affiliated with Asahi Shimbun commented that although both the Japanese and US governments have taken measures to eliminate commercial obstacles and continue to implement business as usual even after the commercial treaty expires, they hope that the US can reconsider its attitude and express its goodwill in adjusting US-Japan relations, thereby ensuring peace in the Pacific and its own interests in East Asia, etc. Newspapers affiliated with the Nichinichi Shimbun believe that the US has no sincerity in preventing the occurrence of a treaty-less state and that its motive seems to be to delay the resolution of the China issue, to unite with Britain and France after the end of the European war to pressure Japan again. At the same time, the US is attempting to use all its economic resources to prevent the smooth progress of Japan's continental policy, etc. "Kokumin Shimbun" warned the US that the treaty-less state risks severing diplomatic relations between the two countries and urged the entire country to face the situation with a firm determination, etc. (Dispatch of the 26th)

### Japanese Commander in Tianjin Threatens the US

Tianjin: Lieutenant General Honma, the commander of the Japanese forces stationed in Tianjin, warned the United States in a solo interview with a reporter from the United Press today, stating that Japan would never change its policy in China. If the United States imposed an embargo on the export of military materials to Japan, Japan would have to consider its attitude towards the United States. Honma stated that the Japanese forces in North China were not afraid of the US increasing its naval power in the Pacific, but he did not believe that war between Japan and the US was possible. Honma also stated that when the 1911 US-Japan Commercial Treaty expired, "If the United States disregards Japan's goodwill towards the United States and does not respond, the Japanese military authorities will have to review the situation and take appropriate steps, such as placing the United States' commercial interests in North China under the same restrictions as those of Britain and France." However, he clarified that the expiration of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty does not necessarily mean a tightening of restrictions on American commerce, but stated that if the United States implements an embargo as a final decision against Japan, "I feel that Japan has no reason to treat the American people better than the people of other countries." Honma then criticized the United States' attitude towards Japan's invasion of China, stating, "I feel that the American people are prepared to view any action taken by the Japanese army in China with malice, or perhaps this is a deliberate misunderstanding of Japan by the American people." However, Honma hoped that relations between the two countries could improve and that war between Japan and the US was impossible. Therefore, Honma repeatedly asked the American people, "What is the reason that the differences between Japan and the US cannot be resolved through negotiations? I do not believe that a US-Japan war is possible." The United Press reporter then asked Honma whether the US-Japan crisis would ultimately be resolved through compromise by both sides or by one side surrendering. Honma replied that Japan would never change its current policy. Although the United States misunderstands Japan's policy of building a "New Order in East Asia," nothing in the world can persuade Japan to abandon or change its established policy. Japan has sacrificed 70,000 lives to build the "New Order in East Asia," so it cannot consider changing its policy. The New Order in East Asia is important to both the US and Japan, so the United States must cooperate with Japan. Japan is not afraid of trading with the Soviet Union and is pleased to do so, but if the United States actually imposes an embargo on Japan, Japan will be forced to trade with the Soviet Union to obtain important military supplies. The Japanese military authorities in Tianjin have not yet imposed commercial restrictions on the United States. If the American people feel that they are subject to restrictions, they must recognize the existence of "large-scale hostile acts" in China. They can then understand that these restrictions are unavoidable. Some restrictions are inevitable. Honma also said that the leather needed by the Japanese army cannot be purchased from the United States due to a lack of foreign exchange, so it must be obtained in China. While criticizing the United States' attitude toward Japan's invasion of China, Honma claimed that he had recently received an anonymous letter from the United States requesting the Japanese officers to withdraw from New York. The letter stated that Japan had established an "Army Headquarters" in New York. The letter advised Japan to withdraw its military officers and kill them. The letter accused the Japanese officers of being spies. Therefore, Honma pointed to this as an example of the United States not understanding Japan, as the Japanese officers in New York were purchasing military supplies for the Japanese army. (United Press report, 26th)

### British-American Relations Cannot Be Alienated: A Japanese-Soviet Union Alliance Appears Difficult to Achieve

Washington: Political figures here attach great importance to the expiration of the US-Japan commercial treaty, and they all believe that the United States' termination of the treaty is a result of Japan's invasion of China. Although Japan has made some concessions to the United States, such as promising to open up the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, in an attempt to begin negotiations on a new commercial treaty with the United States, in practice, the country has not done anything about the new commercial treaty. Although the United States currently has no intention of adopting discriminatory measures against Japan in commerce, political figures believe that from now on, the United States government can take such actions at any time and will no longer be legally bound in any way. Some people, seeing the firm attitude of the United States, took the opportunity to issue a statement stating that the policies pursued by Britain are completely different from those of the United States and that a secret agreement has been reached between Britain and Japan. The intention is clearly to alienate Britain and the United States, but the authorities have firmly denied it, and no one believes it. On the other hand, even if the US-Japan commercial relationship cannot be resolved satisfactorily in the future, Japan may not necessarily form a further alliance with the Soviet Union.

### Divide the Pacific and Far East into New Economic Spheres of Influence: Grant Substantial Interests to Japan: Advocate of US Rear Admiral Yarnell

New York: Former commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, Rear Admiral Yarnell, told reporters that the US-Japan commercial treaty abolished today is the beginning of the resolution of events in the Far East. Yarnell continued that he fully agreed with the prohibition of goods being transported to Japan, but that countries should give Japan a way out in the Pacific in order to weaken Japan's power in China. Rear Admiral Yarnell has also drafted a new map of the economic division of the Pacific. The map stipulates that Britain, France, the Netherlands, and the United States should cede substantial interests to Japan in the Pacific. Rear Admiral Yarnell believes that if countries allow Japan to obtain equal trading opportunities in India, Annam, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines, Japanese liberals will be able to prevent the aggression of the military.

Treading on the sound to complete the broken stones, you walk on the road from the right hand side, the car is waiting nearby, after boarding the car, all the way bumpy downhill, you can directly reach Nanning. Knowing that Commander Du wants to inspect the observation post on the ××× Heights, because he climbed ×× Mountain, it was already sunset, so he went straight up along the × telephone lines of the observation post. This is also where the Japanese stubbornly resisted. Although the evening wind on the top of the mountain is strong, it still cannot sweep away the smell of foreign corpses in the Chinese land. The Japanese warlords originally regarded the lives of soldiers as weeds, but they have always taken the ashes of corpses very seriously. In the Battle of Kunlun Pass, even this point could not be taken care of. We can imagine one aspect of the Japanese army's embarrassment at that time.

The night is thicker, and the sound of machine guns below the mountain is more intense. The Chinese artillery near Kunlun Pass constantly fired ×× mortars at Batang, and the sound of the mountain and valley echoed, creating a mighty momentum. We walked into the observation post.

The staff officer came out of the bunker, and in the starlight, he could still vaguely see his tall figure and weathered face. He said with a smile, "The Japanese artillery is very weak, and the ammunition also seems to be limited. When it fires at our position, it immediately falls silent after our side fires, not daring to fight back. The Chinese artillery overwhelmed the Japanese artillery. The Battle of Kunlun Pass can be said to be the first time."

Behind the small highland in the southwest direction at nine o'clock, there were two fires. Staff Officer × said, "That is the effect of the 50+ bombs dropped by the Japanese aircraft at noon today, causing the grass and trees on these two barren mountains to burn." He talked about the activities of the Japanese aircraft at the front, "One day, the Japanese aircraft dropped more than 100 bombs on our position, but only two brothers were injured. Airplanes cannot threaten us, and we do not necessarily need air cover. In this attack on Kunlun Pass, our artillery still effectively fired on the Japanese position under the circling of Japanese aircraft, and the artillery position was never discovered by the Japanese."

Our artillery continued to fire, and the shells streaked across the night sky, roaring like a long whistle, also like crazy laughter. The concentration of fire from the ×× guns caused a faint red color to appear above Batang, gradually increasing and expanding. The artillery observer reported, "Batang is on fire, and our army is one kilometer away from Batang town."

Commander Du was talking with the commander of the attacking Batang troops at the observation post, knowing that the two wings were progressing very quickly. He pointed to the sparks of the signal gun rising constantly in the distance and said, "That was fired by our vanguard troops. We have completely controlled Batang, but the Japanese are determined to defend Batang to the death, because Batang is the throat of Nanning south of Kunlun Pass. By defending this throat to the death, they can prevent the advance of our army on the front."

It was late at night, and Commander Du told me to go down the mountain first. I groped in the darkness for the telephone line and returned to the road along the original path. I carried the password of the day and passed the second line of sentry posts. The car circled around Kunlun Pass and saw that the old Japanese fortifications already had brothers resting in them. Some twenty or thirty or twenty people were warming themselves around the campfire, talking and laughing. Some were still reading the books, newspapers, and New Year's cards sent by the Guilin press delegation to the front line. They seemed very eager to know many things in the world.

Near ××, a strong scene shot from across the way, the symphony of horse and infinite track, made me realize that the tanks of East China were continuing to advance, and the camouflage made them even bigger. The iron door in front of the driver was open, and the gunner leaned on the turret and waved to the infantry on the side of the road, exchanging cheers of congratulations. "Win the battle!" "Eliminate the enemy!" The sound waves, like tides, rose and fell, echoing and impacting in the valley. This is an unparalleled happiness, and it is also an unparalleled power. We will use this power to fight the invaders. When I returned to the command post, this iron team seemed to be still roaring in this place, hoping to step on their tracks again to Kunlun Pass soon, to Nanning, to the occupied land, and to all the occupied land.

### Japanese Train on Jinpu Railway Overturned: Railway Tracks South of Liguo Station Destroyed: Approximately 70+ Japanese and Puppets Killed or Wounded

Xuzhou Notification: On December 29th of last year, at 11:00 PM, Han Guangda, the chief of the 2nd District of Tongshan, led the 4th Squadron, the Independent Squadron, and the Quan and Ban Detachment to the south of Liguo Station, to the Xiao Gu area of Ba Hei Xu in the north, to destroy the Jinpu Railway. Machine guns were set up on both sides. After nailing down a few, after the Japanese patrol train passed, the track spikes on both ends were completely removed, and the tracks were overturned. A No. 102 Japanese train heading north from Xuzhou was overturned. The Chinese ambush troops concentrated their fire. After the train derailed, it was about paces away from the roadbed. The coal box pressed against the locomotive, followed by the mail car, and then successively crashed and destroyed. There were two baggage cars, one second-class car, and three passenger cars. The next day, according to Li Fucheng, a villager from Huangshan Village, Yanhu Township, 2nd District, who was riding on the train, two Japanese and one puppet were killed on the locomotive. On the guard car, the Japanese lieutenant platoon leader was killed, along with two Japanese soldiers. The Japanese businessmen who were killed or wounded in the other cars were all dragged to Xuzhou that night and could not be counted. However, 147 shoes were found inside and outside the wrecked cars, and the total number is estimated to be over 70. Traffic was not restored until 5:00 PM on the 30th. The Commander-in-Chief of the Su-Lu War Zone was reported and immediately ordered the Dongyi Commander to commend the unit for its actions.

### Japanese Troops in Northern Jiangsu Suddenly Invade Liangtai; Chinese Forces Counterattack and Surround Xianshao, Also Recapturing Yiling and Zhuanqiao; Japanese Planes Continuously Bomb Taixian

Northern Jiangsu Correspondence: The Japanese troops in various locations, including Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, and Jiangyin, have recently been dealt blows by Chinese forces attacking Rugao, Xianshao, and Jijiashi, resulting in favorable outcomes. Feeling greatly threatened, the Japanese army has been shifting and consolidating its forces, dispatching over a dozen warships to simultaneously invade Yangzhong, Taixian, and Taiyu counties, while also sending air support to assist in the battle. On the 14th, Japanese warships anchored near Yangzhong County, simultaneously reinforcing Yangshao. At Tianxingqiao, Longwokou, and other locations, multiple small Japanese steamships forcefully landed troops. At dawn on the 15th, Japanese troops at various locations launched simultaneous attacks, advancing in three routes. The comprehensive battlefield situation of each route is as follows:

Xianshao Front

Starting on the 15th, around three to four hundred Japanese soldiers from Shaobo and five to six hundred from Xiannvmiao, along with over a dozen artillery pieces, combined forces and launched concentrated attacks on Chinese army positions at Zhuanqiao and Yiling. The Chinese army mounted a strong resistance. The Japanese army then used dense artillery fire to destroy Chinese positions in Zhuanqiao and Yiling. After holding out until noon, the Chinese army, lacking defensible terrain, shifted its positions to the vicinity of ××. The Japanese army then occupied the Baita River. In the afternoon, Chinese reinforcements launched a surprise flanking attack, advancing towards Xiannvmiao, causing the Japanese troops advancing towards Taixian to feel threatened by a pincer movement and refrain from venturing deeper. The Baita River was also recaptured by the Chinese army. On the morning of the 16th, the Chinese army continued its pursuit, with high morale, and by the afternoon, had surrounded the Japanese troops near Yiling. The battle was intense. At dawn on the 17th, the Chinese army launched a general counterattack on this front, with the ××× unit being particularly brave, repeatedly charging the Japanese positions. The Japanese army stubbornly resisted in the Yiling and Zhuanqiao areas, but ultimately, due to the Chinese army's relentless bayonet charges, the Japanese were unable to withstand the attacks and collapsed, retreating in disarray. After six or seven hours of bloody battle, Yiling and Zhuanqiao were officially recaptured by the Chinese army. The remaining Japanese troops fled back to their original strongholds in Xiannvmiao and Shaobo. As of 1 PM on the 17th, the Chinese army had restored its original positions on the western front. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties in this battle, with many bodies left unrecovered. The Chinese army also suffered heroic sacrifices. The old positions are currently being reinforced to secure them, while plans are underway to pursue the Japanese army and encircle Xiannvmiao and Shaobo on the morning of the 18th.

Kouan Front

The dozen or so Japanese warships surrounding Yangzhong engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army on the 15th. A portion of the Japanese warships sailed to the north bank at 6 AM on the 15th, using several dozen steamships to land marines at Longwokou, who then advanced north. The Chinese army units stationed at Kouan immediately launched a head-on assault, resulting in fierce fighting. The Japanese army utilized naval gunfire from Yangtze River warships to cover their assault on Chinese positions, with three Japanese planes circling overhead providing support by strafing with machine guns, making it difficult for the Chinese army to maneuver. Kouan, Diajiapu, and  Husou were forced to defend the area as far as Sixiangkou, over ten li away from Taixian. In the afternoon, Chinese reinforcements arrived and launched flanking attacks from both sides, attempting to encircle the Japanese troops. The Japanese army did not dare to advance further and retreated. That evening, Diajiapu was recaptured by the Chinese army. The Japanese unit retreated to Kouan and Longwokou, where they landed. On the 16th and 17th, the Chinese army counterattacked the Japanese army, with intense fighting. However, because the Japanese warships were positioned in the Yangtze River, their effective firing range was sufficient to provide cover, resulting in intense artillery fire. Three Japanese planes also continuously provided support from the air. As the Chinese army's offensive was not very successful, they remained in a stalemate with the Japanese army between Diajiapu and Kouan. On the morning of the 18th, the two sides only made brief contact, and the fighting was not very intense. Because the Japanese army continued to use naval gunfire for cover, they stubbornly defended their strongholds at Kouan and Longwokou. The Chinese army found it difficult to advance further and maintained its defensive position south of Diajiapu, with the two sides in close proximity.

Taiyu Front

At this location, Japanese warships on the Yangtze River also approached Tianxingqiao on the evening of the 15th, forcefully landing troops and shelling the shore with naval guns. The Chinese army engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army along the Yangtze River outside Taiyu, with both sides charging each other. The Japanese army did not break through the Chinese army's defensive lines. On the morning of the 16th, the fighting continued. The Japanese army, with combined land, sea, and air forces, launched a fierce offensive. The Chinese army also put up a head-on resistance, and the fighting was very intense. On the same day, Japanese troops landed at Madian and linked up with the troops at Kouan. Yangtze River warships concentrated their artillery fire, making it difficult for the Chinese army to maneuver. The Chinese army shifted to the vicinity of ×××. On the morning of the 18th, the Japanese army again advanced north from Madian and was ambushed by the Chinese army at Zhangjiabao. The battle was quite intense. As a result, the Japanese army was unable to succeed and retreated to its original position. As of the 18th, the battle situation on all fronts in Taixian had stabilized. The people of Taixian had voluntarily evacuated in recent days and have now mostly returned. However, Japanese planes continue to operate over Taixian every day, either distributing absurd leaflets or strafing with machine guns, making it difficult for the city to recover. For example, at around 9 AM on the morning of the 15th, three Japanese planes flew over, circling for reconnaissance and distributing large numbers of absurd leaflets. At around 1 PM, three more planes flew over, dropping over a dozen bombs in the vicinity of Dazhuqiao inside the city, killing and wounding about a dozen civilians. Again, at around 10 AM on the morning of the 17th, three Japanese planes invaded Taixian and committed atrocities, dropping four or five bombs near Guangxiaosi, Dalinqiao, the County Chamber of Commerce, and other locations. They then flew to  and dropped four or five bombs there as well. At around 1 PM in the afternoon, three more planes returned, circling for reconnaissance, and then dropped four or five bombs at Gangkouzhen before leaving.

### Wuxi City Gates Open, Market is Extremely Desolate, Rice and Flour Prices Skyrocket

Wuxi Correspondence: Since the assassination of Magistrate Yang  Tong, the Japanese army has been causing great disturbances, and the city gates have been tightly closed, cutting off transportation, for seven days. On the 15th, the Fanguangfu Gate and the South Gate were opened first, allowing only women and children to enter and exit. The residents of the city gates were in great distress. After people appealed to the Japanese side, they finally agreed to open all the city gates on the 17th. Entry and exit through the city gates are only permitted with a county resident certificate, and only between 8 AM and 8 PM. Hotels, restaurants, eateries, and teahouses are also allowed to reopen. It is still extremely inconvenient for passengers taking the train. Many innocent people have been arrested by the Japanese in recent days and have been subjected to torture. The successor to the puppet government has not yet been determined, and is currently being temporarily managed by the puppet secretary Tang Yong. The market is facing the traditional New Year, and the closure of the city has had a significant impact, resulting in considerable losses. The price of rice was originally limited to 20.5 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), but recently, due to the scarcity of rice, it has broken the price limit. Baiyang Dazi rice costs 21 yuan, and Ke rice costs 20.5 or 6 yuan. Flour is also expensive, costing 9.5 to 10 yuan per bag. The working class struggles all day and cannot even get enough to eat, so everyone is complaining bitterly. Because Suzhou needs rice for brewing wine, rice is being transported to Suzhou, and the supply is quite strong. Some rice merchants want to find ways to transfer rice to Shanghai, and the current price is 2.35 yuan, but it is difficult to obtain a transport permit, and it is difficult to transport it out for the time being.

### Dinghai Shenjiamen Becomes Smuggling Center

Dinghai Correspondence: Shenjiamen Town, which belongs to the county, is originally a gathering place for the fishing industry on the Zhoushan Islands. Since its fall, due to the transport of fishing boats between Shenjiamen and the Shanghai "Fish Market," smuggling has become extremely rampant. Various domestic goods subject to tax and sea duties are smuggled from various coastal counties to Shenjiamen, where they are transferred to occupied areas. Japanese-made cigarettes (mostly Sanlu), cigarette paper, cloth , white and yellow sugar, etc., are transported from the occupied areas to Shenjiamen for repackaging and exchange before being smuggled into the mainland by coastal fishing boats, generating huge profits. Therefore, Shenjiamen has now become a center for smuggling.

### Chaoshan Chinese Army Assists Farmers in Transporting Large Quantities of Chao Oranges; Main Force Encircles Japanese Troops in Chaozhou from Three Sides; Orders Farmers to Quickly Pick Oranges and Transport Them to Ports

Shantou-Chenghai Correspondence: The annual export value of Chao oranges is about 2 million yuan, most of which are concentrated in Shantou for export. This year, orange-producing areas such as  , Jinshi, Longhu, Caitang, and Fuyang have all become war zones, and land and water transportation have been completely blocked. Foreign merchant ships can only dock in Shantou Port for four hours, making it impossible to export Chao oranges. The price of oranges in various villages has thus fallen, with top-quality oranges only fetching 15 yuan per hundred jin (unit of weight). Farmers in Jieyang and Chaoyang are trying to transport oranges to Shenquan in Huilai by shoulder pole and then transfer them to sailboats to Hong Kong. Each boat can carry 5,000 jin and can be sold at a high price in Hong Kong. However, the sea route is very dangerous and is often intercepted by Japanese motorboats. Rarely are all the goods on board safe. Recently, the Chinese army has penetrated deep into the Chaoshan Railway line, protecting the Chao oranges and agricultural products, and transporting them in large quantities back to Jieyang via sea and highway, transporting them to Hong Kong. However, transportation from the producing areas to the coastal areas is done at night. The Chinese army has also recently launched attacks along multiple routes. Those departing from Fengshun Tiandong , passing through Guxiang Baiyun Mountain, are approaching the northern suburbs of Chaozhou. Those departing from Jieyang Anjie Road are advancing in three routes, searching towards Chaoan City. One route attacked Chihu from Fengxi, and a fierce battle ensued overnight in Chihu on the 12th. On the morning of the 13th, the Japanese army retreated to Xiasi. Villages east of Chihu were completely recovered. Currently, there is a stalemate between Xiasi. Another route advanced to Hougou, Xinxiang, and Beixiang, engaging in fierce fighting with newly arrived Japanese troops. Another route occupied Yinhu. Japanese troops in Yinhu retreated along Huhui Road back to Chaoan. The Chinese army encircled Chaozhou City from three sides. An immediate order was issued to farmers in Jinshi,  Chao, Fuyang, Longhu, and Caitang to quickly pick oranges, harvesting all those that were ripe and transporting them to the Jieyang rear area, where efforts would be made to sell them to Hong Kong in large quantities in order to alleviate the livelihood of farmers.

At the same time, various organizations have gathered to discuss the Spring Labor Troop Support Movement initiated by the National Comforting Troops Association, deciding to start fundraising on February 7th to to the front lines, to express the determination of citizens to protect the country. , Japanese troops near the suburbs have advanced security measures starting from the 25th, deploying additional puppet police sentries and intensifying checks on pedestrians in various locations to prevent Chinese troops from taking the opportunity to attack during the January 28th commemoration. The authorities of both concessions will take temporary security measures tomorrow. All non-essential roads along Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch will remain closed or will be sealed off, and more Chinese and Western detectives and plainclothes personnel will patrol various roads, checking vehicles and pedestrians. The crackdown will be strictly enforced to maintain security within the concessions.

Promoting Honesty and Shame

Urging Compatriots

The Shanghai Honesty and Shame Promotion Committee issued a statement to all Shanghai compatriots on the eve of January 28th: Citizens of Shanghai, you all deeply understand the great significance of this War of Resistance, which is a matter of life and death for the entire nation. At this final stage, we should strengthen our belief in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance, endure hardship, persevere in our positions, and not be threatened or tempted. Let us move forward in unison, muster courage, and make a final effort. Dear compatriots, forward-moving Shanghai compatriots, let us encourage each other, join hands, and embark on the bright path of self-reliance, cutting through the thorns and black magic of the present to welcome the arrival of glorious victory!

### Political Assassination Case

The North-China Daily News reported a case of suspected political assassination at the residence of a Mr. Zhou at No. 120, Lane 214, Tongfu Road. The details are as follows: Yesterday (the 25th) just past noon, four Chinese men entered Mr. Zhou's residence. Three of them were carrying handguns. They forbade anyone from making noise and waited for Mr. Zhou to return home. After about an hour, around 1 PM, Mr. Zhou had not yet returned. At that time, a maid managed to climb onto the roof, sneak into a neighbor's house, and telephone the Chengdu Road police station. A Western Chief Detective Ries and Detective Hill, each leading a team of detectives, rushed to the scene from the Chengdu Road police station, surrounding Mr. Zhou's residence and then entering. When Hill and Western Chief Detective Taylor entered a room, Hill saw a gunman raise his gun to question Taylor. He loudly warned Taylor and simultaneously pushed the door to slam the gunman, preventing him from aiming. Before the gunman could fire, his handgun was confiscated. The other three men were also captured on the spot. The three handguns, all loaded, were handed over to the Firearms Department of the Police Headquarters for inspection yesterday afternoon. On September 24th of last year, when Mr. Zhou and Li Ru , director of the Refugee Orphanage, were walking at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Yunnan Road, they were attacked by an assassin who fired from behind. Mr. Li was shot and died, while Mr. Zhou was unharmed. It is believed that the assassin intended to kill Mr. Zhou but mistakenly shot Mr. Li.

### Puppet Police Make Things Difficult for British Bridge Again

The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that at 8:30 AM today (the 26th), a British man was driving his car along Great Western Road when a Chinese apprentice suddenly ran across the road and was slightly injured when hit by the car. The British man stopped the car and helped the apprentice into the car to take him to the hospital. At the time, a relative of the apprentice was present and asked the British man to take him to the hospital as well. The British man did not understand because of the language barrier, so the car did not leave. Some police from the Great Western Road police station arrived after receiving the news, loaded bullets into their rifles, pointed them at the British man, and blocked his advance. The British man sounded the horn, and police officers from the Anansi police station arrived after hearing the horn. The inspector knew that he could not the man and allowed him to leave safely. He then went to the Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters at No. 13 Great Western Road to file a strong protest. Before the police officers from the police station returned to the scene, an officer from the Great Western Road police station arrived and, realizing that the police were in the wrong, ordered them to withdraw and allowed the British bridge to proceed.

### Merchants and Passengers Stuck in Wenzhou and Ningbo, Local Products Being Rushed to Shanghai; Tight Defense in Mingzhao; Xiaoshan is Indefensible; Deping Wheel is Safe and Will Return to Shanghai Today

Yesterday, rumors circulated in Shanghai that Zhaoqing had fallen and that Japanese planes had bombed Ningbo. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with shipping industry sources and related parties yesterday and learned that reports were received in Shanghai from Ningbo at 12:00 PM and 4:00 PM yesterday stating, "Ningbo is safe, Mingzhao's telegrams and long distance calls are still working". Nothing was said about Japanese planes bombing Mingbo, which is enough to prove the falls of Zhao and the bombing of Ningbo is not true. However, the county seat of Xiaoshan is indefensible and the situation is unclear. As for coastal areas such as Ningbo, Taizhou, and Wenzhou, security is very tight. The inspection of ships, goods, and passengers entering and leaving is particularly strict. Furthermore, a reporter from Datong News Agency recently inquired with Zhejiang Province, and Luko learned that the Japanese troops crossing the river have now retreated to Xiaoshan Jianggan, appearing to retreat to the north bank. The troops that advanced to Qianqingzhen have also withdrawn, appearing to abandon their strongholds. Yiqiao Guqing also has no trace of the Japanese army. The saying about the war near Zhaoqing that Jinua reported, obviously meant the troops that were advancing to Qianqingzhen, and were ambushed by the Chinese army. However, this has already passed, and Zhao currently appears safe, but the public is relatively frightened. The two Changdi Banks has X County, but still have an office.

Deping Wheel Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai Today

The person in charge of Sino-Italian Shipping Company told the Xin Sheng News Agency that the reason for the Deping Wheel's delay in Ningbo was initially due to the wind and snow outside Zhenhai Port, which hindered the unloading work. Then, because the unloading was not completed, it had to delay its return to Shanghai. The loading and unloading are all contracted by the transportation company, and the loading and unloading is carried out in sequence. It is impossible to speed it up. The company has telegraphed the ship master to load less cargo and depart for Shanghai today (27th), and it is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 27th. As early as January 29th (Monday), it will set sail from Shanghai to Ningbo again. All the lies about the Deping Wheel outside are not to be believed.

Wenzhou and Ningbo are Safe

Local Products Rushed for Transport

The Norwegian company Hua Lun Yanghang reported to Shanghai yesterday that the Da Bu Wheel arrived in Zheng yesterday and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning. Because the road between Binbo and the interior of the country is completely closed due to military relations, and the transportation of goods imported through Binbo is time-consuming, the various merchants in Shanghai, fearing that the situation may change during this wartime, have stopped going to import goods, and have telegraphed to ask to return the goods that have arrived in Zhenhai but have not been unloaded to Shanghai. As for the local products stranded in !Bo, the English ship Mannie Maller, agented by Daxin Bank, arrived in Shanghai from Wenzhou the night before last, and is scheduled to continue sailing to Wenzhou today. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed the crew of the ship. According to them, the south side of Wenzhou is as safe as usual, and residents have been evacuated to prevent bombing by Japanese aircraft. As for the foreign ships currently anchored outside Jiang, there are four English merchant ships: Anf, Xinan, Xinan and Yongfeng. There are many local products stranded in Wenzhou, and efforts are being made to transport them to Shanghai.

Exchange Suspended

Telegrams Continue

A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with the Transportation Section of the Postal Administration and learned that, due to the heavy military transport since the outbreak of the war in the counties of Eastern Zhejiang and along the Zhejiang Railway line, the dispatch of parcels to the above-mentioned areas has been temporarily suspended since yesterday morning. The notice stated that, starting from the 26th of this month, all large parcels to County and those passing through it (including Yongjia) will be temporarily suspended from collection and dispatch. In addition, a delayed telegram issued by the Lishui Administration at 23 locations was received yesterday, stating that, starting today, the collection and dispatch of all remittances to Shaoyu, Zhuji, Fengqiao, Pai Tou, Xiaoshan, Anchang, Ma An, Dongkai, Linpu, Guanjia, Keqiao, Yiqiao, Xiafangqiao, Sunrui, etc., has been temporarily suspended. As for light postal items, they will still be delivered as usual. According to the news from the Great Northern, Great Eastern, and Pacific Telegraph Companies, the water line telegrams from Shanghai to Shaoyang and Xiaoshan are still receiving signals as usual. Whether they can reach their destination from Hong Kong cannot be predicted.

### British Ship Blocked by Japanese Warships off Fuzhou; Detained for Eleven Hours; Inspection but No Signature

The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that Yongsheng Wheel of Jardine Matheson & Co., which sails along the Chinese coast, arrived in Shanghai this morning (26th) with several passengers. The ship was intercepted by the Japanese Navy for eleven hours outside Fuzhou this Wednesday. Because the British ship did not send a radio report, and the British Navy authorities did not publish the ship's movements, the news of Yongsheng being intercepted was not previously known. The incident went as follows: Yongsheng Wheel was sailing outside Fuzhou this Wednesday, and a Japanese destroyer approached and launched two empty cannons. Yongsheng immediately stopped to wait for the Japanese Navy to verify the ship's identity. After a while, a team of Japanese sailors boarded the ship. Their officers asked the Yongsheng Wheel captain if the British Navy had intercepted Maru et al. and interrogated the passengers. After everything was completed, they did not sign the documents proving that the ship had been inspected, but detained the Yongsheng Wheel for eleven hours for no reason before releasing it. This incident is similar to the interception of the British ship Lanpura by the Japanese Navy outside Hong Kong four months ago. Even though Japan has not declared war on China, it has no right to intercept ships of third countries in warring countries, but

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, there have been many reports of Japan intercepting and boarding ships of third countries. In order to avoid unfortunate incidents, the British authorities have ordered British merchant ships to respond to signals from Japanese warships and report the name of the ship. According to Sir Clerk, the British Ambassador to Japan, yesterday (25th) to Japanese journalists, since the start of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, British merchant ships have been intercepted by the Japanese Navy no less than 191 times.

The country has lost its pillar, and the people have lost their teacher. We hate the blue sky, taking our master away, taking our master away without delay. Although our master has passed away, his spirit will not die. He is a teacher of China, revered by the world. China has a teacher, and the rivers and mountains will be cleared up. Although our master has passed away, his spirit will not die. Although our master has passed away, his spirit will not die. The rivers and mountains will be cleared up. (2) Alas, our master is a model for the nation, and the towering mansion has collapsed. We hate the blue sky, how can it bear such a thing? We lost our good teacher and tears wet our clothes. Although his body has passed away, his spirit will live forever. He is the light of China, the soul of China. The soul of China shines as long as the sun and the moon. He is the light of China, the soul of China. He is the light of China, the soul of China, and shines as long as the sun and the moon.

Water Dragon Chant

Liu Gonghe wrote a Water Dragon Chant in memory of Mr. Ma Xiangbo: Decaying like a clean valley, withered pines, a hundred years of sleep, a vicissitude of eyes. The wandering summons is outside, the old people of the Central Plains, the setting sun is sad late. The green carriage rises in the west, the scenery spreads in the east (the two sentences can be found in the Jingjiao monument, which is the beginning of Catholicism entering China). To amend the secluded explanations, the Canghuang North Wish, the rivers and mountains are embroidered, what world is this? Tears are full of traces. The cranes are flying immortals and not returning. Countless winds and clouds have scattered. The family mountain Seven Temples, the stele sinks into the Liang Phase (Youda is the Yelike Wen, which is the Catholic Church, in the Seven Temples of Zhenjiang, see Zhi Shunzhi's Da Yu Guosi Liang Xiang stele record for details). To whom should this emotion be sent? Looking to the edge of Yan, the great call to mourn, the frost sky Qiang flute, is better than a cavity of lone anger. Full of doors and peaches and plums, touching the times and worrying.

### American Ambassador on His Way to Hankou, Japanese Side Deliberately Spreads Alarming Rumors, Claiming the National Government Ordered Guerrillas to Harm Him, American Residents All Find It Absurd and Ridiculous

The English-language "China Press" reports that the Japanese "New Shanghai News" today (the 26th) published war news stating that Chongqing had instructed special agents and guerrillas in the Yangtze River area to harm American Ambassador Johnson, who is currently en route to Hankou, in order to blame Japan and make US-Japan relations even more difficult.

(American Residents in This City)

Find this claim absurd and ridiculous, as Sino-American relations have always been friendly, and Johnson enjoys a good reputation in Chongqing. American residents also recalled that after Fessenden, Director-General and Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, narrowly escaped an assassination attempt, Japanese newspapers immediately claimed that the assassin was sent by Chongqing. However, the police found that the attacker came from Dastis. The general public believes that the Japanese propaganda about Chongqing plotting such a thing is a kind of

(Preventative Measure)

To prevent the repeal of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty, and to provide an excuse if they attempt anything against Johnson. The American Ambassador arrived in Nanjing at 10:30 AM on Wednesday and continued upstream on the Luzon yesterday morning (the 25th). He will stay briefly in Wuhu and Jiujiang, and is expected to arrive in Hankou on Monday.

### Salary Increase of French Tram Company Employees

Yesterday, we received a letter from the Shanghai Second District Water and Electricity Workers' Union, making a statement regarding the salary increase issue of the French Tram Company. The original letter stated, "After reading the report on the salary increase issue of the French Tram Company on page nine of the third section of your newspaper on the 26th, we found that many of the facts stated were inconsistent with reality. Our union members, due to the high cost of living, rice, firewood, and fuel being expensive, gathered to discuss demanding a temporary increase in

Year-End Bonus

Of one month's salary, with a uniform 20% increase in wages, from the French Water and Electricity Company. Our union sent a letter to the French Water and Electricity Company on December 21st of last year. Our union then held two negotiations with Mr. Fa, the manager of the company, on December 26th and 27th. However, the manager of the company stated that the accounts for 1939 had already been reported to the board of directors, and it would be difficult to approve the request for a one-month increase in the year-end bonus for all workers. Until January 24th, workers from various departments, as the

Final Conclusion

Date was approaching, hoped that the salary increase issue would be resolved as soon as possible. Therefore, they sent nine representatives to request from the company. As a result, labor and management negotiated a solution. However, due to the long time, the workers working in the factory hoped that the representatives would return to the factory to report, and the work was slightly suspended. However, more than seventy workers at the Dongjiadu Water Plant followed the union's instructions and continued to work as usual, and the workers in the Lujiiawan engine room continued to work as usual, and there was no strike. On the afternoon of the same day, our union again

Sent Representatives

To request from the company. The manager of the company contacted the results and decided to solve it on the 26th. All workers were satisfied and returned to work as usual at 2:50 PM. In the multiple contacts, our union representatives directly negotiated with Mr. Fa, the manager. Mr. Tu Jingsheng only served as a translator and had nothing to do with the case. The stabbing of Mr. Tu's younger brother is even more

Irrelevant

We believe that the rumor is untrue and should be corrected. As for the salary increase method, it was resolved at 5:00 PM on the 26th. The method is that each worker will receive a temporary subsidy of 1.5 jiao for rice per day, and the wages of senior workers will increase by 8 fen per day. All workers expressed satisfaction upon hearing the news, and the salary increase method mentioned in your newspaper on the 26th (according to this manuscript, it was translated from the English "China Press") is inconsistent with the facts, and please correct it accordingly."

The temperature from 5:00 to 6:00 AM dropped to 6.1 degrees Celsius below freezing point, only 21 degrees Fahrenheit, which was the first day of severe cold this year. As a result, the sewers, canals, and water storage equipment all froze into thick ice. The coldness of the weather was such that water would freeze into ice. Pedestrians on the street all looked huddled up. Refugees and beggars could not bear the cold and were freezing to death in large numbers. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the Pushan Villa found 15 adult corpses and 68 child corpses in the Public Concession the day before yesterday. Yesterday, another 24 adult corpses and 65 child corpses were collected. In two days, the total number reached 182.

As the inland rivers and harbors were also frozen, there were few ships entering and leaving Suzhou Creek yesterday. As the number of people carrying vegetables into the market suddenly decreased, the price of noodles was extremely high. It is said that this cold weather will continue for several days. It is also said that the temperature in Beiping yesterday morning also dropped to minus ten degrees, which was extremely cold.

The Shanghai Office of the China Tzu-yu Association, in view of the fact that the north wind has been blowing fiercely in recent days and the weather has been extremely cold, the general poor children have no clothes to cover their bodies, which is very miserable, especially the children in shantytowns and on the streets, who are the most painful. Therefore, they have specially processed and rushed to make the second batch of 4,000 sets of winter clothing to meet the urgent need. The association has sent people to various poor areas to investigate and distribute winter clothing coupons. It is now scheduled to distribute the winter clothing in three districts.

Charity Federation Was Unable to Finish in Time

Recently, the weather in this city has been severely cold, and there are many frozen corpses on the road. The situation of the poor who are suffering from the cold is particularly pitiful. The Shanghai Charity Federation, in view of this, has specially rushed to make a large number of cotton clothes and distributed them to the poor in the open space of the association at 35 Yunnan Road to protect against the winter cold. In recent days, many people have heard the news and went to receive them. The association has distributed a total of more than 2,600 sets of cotton clothes in four times. The beneficiaries are all smiling. It is now heard that the association is unable to finish making the cotton clothes and is having difficulty coping. In addition to separately handing them over to the refugee shelter groups for tailoring, the distribution has been temporarily suspended. In addition, the number of people waiting for relief rice buns and ginger soup at Dagu Road every night has been increasing day by day. Last night (the 26th), it has increased sharply to more than 4,500 people, and 45 bags of flour were distributed.

The number of people receiving white rice distributed by the Shanghai Municipal Council at Moore Hall also increased sharply yesterday.

### Foreign Rice Arrives One After Another, Market Price Rises Instead, Breaking the 40 Yuan Mark, Authorities in Both Concessions Have Been Closely Monitoring

Foreign rice has arrived one after another, reported by the newspapers, but the price of rice remains firm, and because it is not restricted, the market opened yesterday and broke the 40 yuan mark, exceeding the price limit for japonica rice, which has a significant impact on the livelihoods of the common people.

### A Review of Shanghai's Industry in 1939 (1) – The Shanghai Municipal Council Annual Report – Part 3

During the first six months of last year, the industrial sector of this city continued the recovery trend of the previous year. Many large and medium-sized factories, which started construction in the previous year in the Western Shanghai and extra-settlement road areas, commenced operations last year. In addition, some emerging industries, previously unseen in the concessions, began preparations at the beginning of last year, with promising preliminary plans.

In June of last year, the exchange rate tightened, and in July, it fell again, with a far-reaching impact. Some projects were abandoned as a result, and factories with new buildings nearing completion were forced to temporarily suspend idle work. The prices of many industrial raw materials rose sharply; partly due to the devaluation of the exchange rate, and partly because some people used their savings to purchase goods for speculation, resulting in a situation where raw materials were more profitable than manufactured goods. Before market demand returned to normal and retail prices were adjusted, the output of various factories was reduced.

As the European war broke out, the source of raw materials became more difficult. Some speculators anticipated a shortage of various raw materials, so they became active in the market again, making it difficult for manufacturers to purchase for legitimate business. As a result, in December, the Straits Settlements government adopted war measures, announcing the prohibition or restriction of entry of many goods, which dealt another severe blow to the industrial sector of this city.

The industrial sector of this city lost its usual market in the Yangtze River basin due to the war, the difficulty and restriction of transporting goods to un-occupied areas, the adoption of business control policies in other places, and the lack of purchasing power of the people. As a result, Chinese and foreign manufacturers have successively turned to foreign countries to develop, and have gained new markets in India, South Africa, and other places. Unfortunately, after the outbreak of the European war, various countries announced restrictive policies one after another, so that some of the new markets that have been obtained have been blocked, and the uncertainty of shipping has made the general manufacturers more difficult.

(Overview of Various Industries) Cotton Mills: The cotton mill business in the Western Shanghai and extra-settlement road areas developed greatly last year. Many new factories have started operation. As of the end of the year, there were 46 large cotton mills in the above two districts. Except for three, the rest have not seen any slackening in work. However, some small cotton mills have reduced work due to the impact of foreign exchange contraction.

Chemical Plants: There is a noteworthy new development in the manufacturing of industrial chemical plants. Two new plants manufacturing hydrochloric acid and sodium sulfate are under construction. One of them is about to start operation. Two more are in the planning stage. Two new plants manufacturing alcohol are preparing to start operation, one of which intends to use grains as raw materials. Four new plants manufacturing red lead (one of which also manufactures lead acetate and zinc sulfate) have all started operation.

### Retired Detective Commits Fraud to Obtain Money, Arrested in a Brothel, Frauds 7,000 Yuan in Movement Expenses, Confesses to the Charges

The reception office of the Tongcheng Silk Mill at 406 Jiangxi Road recently had raw silk worth about 20,000 yuan detained in Nantao and could not be transported out. While they were planning a proper solution, a retired Chinese detective, Sun Renjie (also known as Sun Wenxiang), went to contact Xie Di'an, the associate manager of the office, and said that he had a way to transport the raw silk to Shanghai, but he had to pay a considerable amount of movement expenses.

### Qiuyuan Casino Illegally Detains Rickshaw Pullers, Resentment for Not Sending Gamblers, Released After Negotiation by the Rickshaw Company

According to the China Press, in order to attract customers, the Shanghai West gambling den pays for the car fare and tips for gamblers who travel by rickshaw, and also gives a tip of as much as 1.5 yuan to the rickshaw drivers in order to win them over. However, the drivers of the Yinse, Tailai, Yunfei, and Xingxiangsheng rickshaw companies in this city only give a tip of 0.2 yuan in addition to the car fare. The drivers of the four rickshaw companies decided not to send gamblers to the Qiuyuan Casino. The operators of the casino believed that the drivers' actions had a great impact on the business of Qiuyuan. Last night, they sent a number of armed Chinese and Japanese people to rent rickshaws from the four companies in various parts of the two concessions, forcing the drivers to drive to the Qiuyuan Casino with guns. No fewer than 14 cars arrived one after another, and then the drivers were imprisoned in the casino as punishment. The rickshaw companies were very worried because the cars had not returned to the station for a long time. They then learned the location of the drivers and sent representatives to negotiate with Qiuyuan. It was not until 10:30 PM that all the detained cars and drivers were retrieved.

Education News

### National Language Education Association Actively Promotes National Phonetic Alphabet, Planning to Open 1,500 Classes in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Macau, and Other Places

Hong Kong Communication: The National Phonetic Alphabet is a rational phonetic writing system formulated by the government to assist Chinese characters. Since its promulgation, it has been actively promoted by Li Jinxi, Lu Yiyan, Zhao Yuanren, Huan Lixing, Ma Guoying, and others from the National Language Association. It has been applied in various provinces and cities in the country, and hundreds of thousands of people have been educated. It is expected that within a few years, illiteracy can be reduced by more than half. The Central Ministry of Education recently decided to order the National Language Education Association to hold 1,500 National Phonetic Alphabet training classes for people in Hong Kong, Macau, and other places, so that people in Hong Kong and Macau can use the National Phonetic Alphabet to write and compose essays in a few months. The classes will be held in various schools. The first batch of schools to be contacted for opening classes includes the Confucian Academy and the Zheng Hua Middle School, among dozens of others. A class will be opened as soon as 30 people are enrolled. Major companies, businesses, and factories can write to request that personnel be sent to teach, free of charge. The teachers have passed the national examination and are registered with the Hong Kong government. Westerners in Hong Kong who wish to learn the pronunciation for the convenience of communication between Chinese and Western cultures and commercial contacts between Chinese and foreign workers may also participate. The lectures are annotated with the International Phonetic Alphabet, making learning extremely easy. (Hong Kong registration office: National Language Association, 410 Hennessy Road.) Under the planning of experts, this movement will be carried out jointly in more than a dozen provinces and cities, aiming to introduce the national phonetic alphabet to overseas Chinese communities so that illiterate people can acquire tools for learning and education can be greatly developed.

### Ministry of Education to Revise Special Teacher Course Subjects and Hours

Chongqing Communication: The Ministry of Education has hired experts to revise the weekly teaching subjects and hours for special normal courses and simplified normal courses in order to meet the needs of the War of Resistance and national construction. The regulations for special normal courses and simplified normal courses are also being drafted.

### Hong Kong Government Promulgates New School Building Regulations, Schools Request Postponement of Implementation

Hong Kong Communication: In order to improve school hygiene and protect the health of students, the Hong Kong authorities have promulgated the new school building regulations, which were passed by the Legislative Council half a year ago, to all schools, ordering them to be implemented immediately. Violators will be dealt with separately. The aforementioned regulations were originally to take effect after New Year's Day, but because most schools were on winter vacation, the authorities, in line with the principle of strict legislation but lenient enforcement, postponed it until now. The authorities have only been sending personnel to urge the schools to comply as soon as possible, but have not yet strictly enforced them. Approximately when the winter vacation ends and the new semester begins after the Chinese New Year, these regulations must be implemented. Time flies, and the deadline is approaching. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Federation is currently petitioning the authorities to improve the new regulations to avoid affecting general primary and secondary schools. More than 300 primary and secondary schools will jointly sign and seal a petition to the Hong Kong government, requesting that school buildings be gradually improved.

### Ministry of Education Approves Sichuan and Hubei Provinces to Modify Enrollment for Simplified Normal Courses

### A Controversy in the Western Youth Basketball Game: Hua Wen Leaves the Court and Refuses to Continue the Game, Hua Lian Entire Team Leaves, Military Officers Declared Victorious

In last night's Western Youth Basketball Group A game between Hua Lian and Military Officers, Borat and Zhang Wen, the sports directors of the association, served as referees. After the game, Hua Lian scored three consecutive baskets, leading 6-0. The military officers caught up to 11-11 and then surpassed them 13-12. After that, the scores fluctuated unpredictably. At halftime, Hua Lian trailed 23-28 by five points. After the switch, Hua Lian scored one throw and three penalties, forcing a tie at 28-28. From this point, a seesaw battle formed, with neither side giving way. At a tie of 39-39, with nine minutes remaining, Hua Lian player Shen Yu Gong suddenly collided with referee Borat. Borat believed that Shen deliberately fouled and ordered Shen to leave the court. Shen said it was unintentional and refused the decision. The two sides were deadlocked. The Hua Lian players immediately left the court in protest and refused to continue the game. The referee then announced that Hua Lian had forfeited and the military officers were victorious, resulting in an unhappy ending. Before that, there was a game between Mai Hong and Little Bear. In the first half, Little Bear took the lead 15-14. As a result, Mai Hong reversed the defeat with 25-19 to win. With Little Bear defeated and Hua Lian also declared to have forfeited, it seems that Mai Bai can now be compared to the Western Youth. Today there are three Group B games, with the following order:

Skull Uniform - Shanghai Light (B) 3:15 PM

Light and Solid - Giant (B) 4:00 PM

South Man - Aurora (B) 5:00 PM

### Today, Qinghua Battles the Italian Navy to Seize a Spot in the Zilin Cup Replay

### Once the Paper Tiger is Pierced, Grain Manipulation is Complete, Blatantly Violating Prohibitions, Reed-Tip Rice Etc. Are Sold at High "Keng" Prices, Although Foreign Rice Arrives From Saigon, Prices Have Reached Forty Yuan, People's Food is Completely Controlled, Truly Causing Subjects to Starve to Death. Hoarding is Rampant.

Yesterday, a considerable amount of early and late rice and other goods, originating from the interior and transferred from the Hongkou district to the South Bund, reached no less than one or two thousand bags. Hoarders have been actively engaged in large-scale activities for days. Unscrupulous merchants treat prohibitions like mere baubles, continuing to act as they please, openly raising and subtly increasing prices. Although the nominal "medium and inferior" grades are still listed with a price limit of forty yuan, actual transactions are scarce, effectively making it a "mere price tag." After Saigon rice soared to forty yuan the day before yesterday, yesterday, even reed-tip foreign rice dared to follow suit, breaking the limit and rising directly to forty yuan. This is truly a great absurdity under heaven. Local people turn a deaf ear and turn a blind eye, passively watching as common people are on the verge of "subjects starving to death." Although the "paper tiger" is fierce, once pierced, it emboldens unscrupulous merchants and even leads to "a donkey wearing a tiger skin," providing an excuse for rising grain prices. Seeing this situation, the general public all become involved in manipulating rice and flour, leading people to mistakenly believe what the manipulators claim is true. Everyone panics, which is truly lamentable. This is all due to the malfeasance of rice merchants and the failure to effectively plan for the food supply of the entire city of Shanghai. It is a lamentable state of affairs. If this continues, there will inevitably come a day when Shanghai has to resort to bran to stave off hunger. Yesterday, the market saw only a smattering of early and late rice transactions, with only four or five hundred bags of goods from Lilizhen and Shengzezhen being traded at a price of forty yuan. The Qing Si brand, which is particularly thin, was similarly priced. The reed-tip foreign rice market was chaotic, with prices soaring to forty yuan. Rice merchants, fearing that they would attract attention and be interfered with, kept it secret and did not disclose it publicly. Baiyuan rice, a seasonal necessity, was being purchased by cake shops and food vendors in haste, and the market saw a considerable price decrease. The price has increased by about half a cent, but unfortunately, there is a shortage of high-quality goods on the market, and most of the transactions are for mid-grade goods. Apart from the Baiyuan rice from Jinyang, which is priced at forty yuan, Baiyuan rice from Danyang is thirty-nine yuan, and even the cheaper grades require around thirty-eight yuan.

Saigon Rice Actually Reaches Forty Yuan

Since Saigon No. 1 rice soared to forty yuan per "shi" (unit of volume) the day before yesterday, merchants yesterday have been hoarding and speculating even more vigorously. Various parties are clamoring for purchases, shouting high prices, manipulating supply and demand, and driving the market higher and higher. Adding to this, reed-tip foreign rice has also broken the limit and soared, even reaching the same price as the high-quality "Keng" rice. Foreign rice is like "a tiger growing wings," and hoarders are as greedy as "wolves devouring sheep." By noon, the market became even more chaotic. Saigon No. 1 initially opened at forty yuan, but closed at forty yuan and seven cents, or forty yuan and five cents. Saigon No. 2 also required forty yuan to thirty-nine yuan and seven or eight cents. Fire-milled rice was initially priced at thirty-nine yuan, but then rose to thirty-nine yuan and five or six cents. Tokyo sharp-tip large-grain rice was sold at thirty-seven yuan for the best quality and thirty-six yuan and a half for the next grade. Rice bran was thirty-six yuan, and broken rice was thirty-one or two yuan, all of which were seven or eight cents to one yuan higher than the previous market. It is estimated that a total of sixteen or seventeen thousand bags were traded throughout the day.

The Price of Foreign Rice Remains Stable

The price of foreign rice remains stable, despite the fluctuations in the price of domestic rice. However, the top-grade rice, such as Saigon No. 1, is still difficult to procure. Fortunately, there is still a large supply of spot goods on the market, so it is not too difficult to obtain. Yesterday, brokers continued to trade 1,200 tons of No. 2 rice to Jianyuan and other companies at a price of 48 yuan and 7 cents, plus five cents, making it 48 yuan and 7.5 cents. In addition, 3,500 tons of small milled rice were newly traded at a price of 47 yuan and a half. The price of broken rice has not been settled, and returned goods have not been opened for sale as they are holding out for higher prices. Recently, foreign rice has once again triggered hoarding activities, and sellers are also holding out for higher prices, refusing to sell.

Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Arrive in Shanghai

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai, but the price of rice does not decrease, which has a significant impact on the livelihoods of ordinary people. This is because powerful individuals are manipulating the market. Yesterday, the Yih Ho Foreign Firm's ship "Yongsheng" arrived from Hong Kong with 2,293 bags, which were unloaded at the Roosevelt Warehouse. Another 14,163 bags were transported to Tianjin on the same ship. It is also reported that the Italian ship "Sumatra" (transliteration) is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 28th). This ship is carrying more than 20,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon. After import, it is scheduled to dock at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. (Zu)

Flour Price Increases are Underway

Yesterday, the flour market trend was still tense, and flour prices were exceptionally high. Although the factories on this street are maintaining the original price of ten yuan, the supply is very limited. This ten yuan flour price and the forty yuan rice price are both deceptive price tags for the masses. Due to insufficient current sales of flour, there were several disputes yesterday and the day before yesterday. Yesterday, Yuan Longchang and others requested the factories to increase prices and sell as much as possible. Although the factories were tempted, they feared that large-scale sales would lead to profits flowing out, so they continued to use the excuse of high costs and limited price increases, claiming that they would still suffer significant losses. They have not yet agreed to approve the price increase. However, according to factory sources, the two parties are currently negotiating, and the price may be slightly increased next week, and the shops will also have a uniform sales price. Customer orders have not been opened for a long time. Except for a small number of customers who urgently need flour and slightly purchase returned goods, there are rarely large transactions. Therefore, the market is quite quiet. However, the price of returned flour is being strongly supported and hoarded by general hoarders due to the limited supply from the factories, causing the price of warehouse receipts to be several cents to one cent higher than the previous two days. It is estimated that "Bing Chuan" brand is eleven yuan and five and a half cents, "Green Cannon" brand is eleven yuan and eight cents, and "Old Cart" brand is still eleven yuan and two and a half cents. This is because the goods supplied by the factories to this street are mostly "Old Cart" brand, so the market price is lower than other brands. The total customer transactions in the market amounted to more than 10,000 bags. The future of flour prices is consistently high, and the problem of livelihood is particularly difficult. It is heard that a certain association is planning to discuss ways to suppress the rising prices of flour and wheat, but empty talk cannot compensate for the facts, and repeated violations of prohibitions are also beyond control. This is why unscrupulous merchants dare to form a "grain manipulation network."

Wheat Price is About to Exceed Twenty Yuan

Due to the manipulation of flour, the raw material wheat is also being manipulated, creating a situation where wheat is more expensive than flour. The day before yesterday, the price of wheat actually reached twenty yuan per hundred catties. Yesterday, the market was as firm as ever, because export demand and Japanese factory demand were strong, so everyone was bullish on the market. Given this situation, it is feared that the price will soon exceed the twenty yuan mark. Yesterday, wheat from Jiangsu, Changzhou, and Wuxi was priced at twenty yuan, and wheat from Yangzhou was nineteen yuan and seven or eight cents. Huafeng Factory and Fuxin Factory purchased 1,000 bags and 6 truckloads, respectively. Fufeng Factory is temporarily not accepting purchases, and the market is already in a state of brewing.

Soybeans See New High Price Yesterday

Yesterday, the soybean market situation, under the fierce looting of general hoarders, the market price set a new record again. Dingjiazhou soybeans have reached the 22 yuan mark. According to observations of people in the industry, the overall situation is that it is hopeless within the lunar new year, so their peak-climbing intentions are still enthusiastically advancing. Yesterday, hoarders from Hong Kong and Shantou divided up more than 1,000 bags of Dingjiazhou soybeans, priced from 21 yuan and six cents to 22 yuan. Hoarders on this street purchased five or six truckloads of Nanjing soybeans, priced from 19 yuan and five cents to 20 yuan. Wuhu soybeans were 200 bags at 20 yuan and six cents, and Chongming Sand Yellow soybeans were 400 bags at 21 yuan and the next grade was 18 yuan and seven cents.

Export Volume of Miscellaneous Grains Today

Today (the 27th), 9,000 bags of flour will be exported to Tianjin, and 7,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Xiamen. In addition, there are 1,210 bags of wheat, 685 bags of beans, 6,220 pieces of soybean cake, and 400 pieces of raw oil, which will also be shipped to Xiamen.

### Finance: Quiet Exchange Market

The foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC's listing, are still stable. The black market in British currency is still mediocre and colorless, with minimal changes. It was tight first and then loose, so the result was slightly harder than yesterday. As for the process of the day, the morning opening showed a slightly tight state, at 4 shillings 671875 and 7 yuan 75, a decrease of 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively. Subsequently, Hong Kong telegrams first came to sell off, and then speculators also slightly settled, so the price rebounded to 4 shillings 703125 and 7 yuan 8125. Extending to noon, there was a lack of discussion and trading, and the state was tranquil. The afternoon closing was 4 shillings 6875 and 7 yuan 78125. The afternoon situation was still lackluster. Hong Kong telegrams came to sell slightly again, but the appetite of outsiders was weaker, so the result was a loose closing price of 4 shillings 703125 and 7 yuan 8125, a decrease of 0.015625 and 0.03125 compared to the previous day. The potential of forward goods is comparable to that of spot goods.

Hong Kong is Still Continuously Selling

At the beginning of the morning, the London premium was reduced by 1875 recently and 5 in the distance. New York silver price remained unchanged, London raw gold remained unchanged, and exchange rates for British currency against the U.S., Shanghai, and France were all unchanged. The US dollar against the British pound fell by 5, against Shanghai by 2 points, and against France by 375 points. The central listing of various exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was British currency 4 shillings 671875 and US currency 7 yuan 75, compared to the previous closing, the British pound was tight at 0.015625, and the US dollar was soft at 0.03125. After the opening, trading was stagnant, and the situation was very flat. HSBC's listing was announced as unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced to be reduced by 125 points. After that, Hong Kong telegrams came slightly to sell off, and at the same time, local floaters also slightly settled, and the market situation turned loose. It is estimated that Hong Kong telegrams sold spot British currency to outsiders such as Yooli at 4 shillings 702125, and February British currency at 4 shillings 65625, and speculators sold February U.S. currency to outsiders at 7 yuan 6875. At this time, the spot price also rose to 7 yuan 8125. After that, the selling trend subsided, and the situation returned to calm. Only outsiders slightly traded with each other. Until noon closing, the bank's spot selling price was British currency 4 shillings 6875 and U.S. currency 7 yuan 78125, compared to the morning opening, the British currency rebounded by 0.015625, and the US currency rebounded by 0.03125.

Foreign Banks Lack Interest in Buying

The market situation in the afternoon was still tranquil, but the market momentum was slightly loose, because Hong Kong telegrams came again to sell spot U.S. currency to outsiders at 7 yuan 8125. After the entry, outsiders had little appetite for the high price, and instead had the intention to supply, so until the evening closing, the bank's spot selling price was British currency 4 shillings 703125 and U.S. currency 7 yuan 8125, and the next month's term British currency was 4 shillings 640625 and U.S. currency 7 yuan 65625. As a result, the current term British currency decreased by 0.015625 compared to the previous day, and the US dollar also increased by 0.03125.

Hong Kong U.S. Currency Slightly Tight

Hong Kong, 26th, the exchange market opened flat this morning. British and Japanese currencies have not changed. Spot U.S. currency is tight at 0.0625, at 24 yuan 6875. The market exchange rate for spot has increased by 1 yuan, to 316 yuan. It was stable at 11:30 a.m., and there were no changes in any exchange rates. At 2:30 p.m., it was still flat and unchanged.

Tianjin British and American Currencies Both Rebounded Loose

Tianjin, 26th, the exchange market opened flat this morning. Spot British currency rebounded loosely by 0.03125, British currency was 4 shillings 34375, and U.S. currency was 7 yuan 21875. The Shanghai currency continued to increase by half a yuan, to 107 yuan, and the "Union Note" black market was 25 cents cheaper, to 98 yuan and 75 cents.

### Tired Gold Market

Yesterday's spot gold black market situation was increasingly quiet, and the buying and selling response was mediocre. The trend was slightly weak, because the retail bulls were willing to sell off in this stagnant situation. The morning opening was immediately reduced by 2 yuan, to 4,124 yuan, because the gold number was the first to sell off. Later, the exchange market was reported to be loose, and it was even more unsustainable. Moreover, a certain securities group sold off a lot, and it gradually fell to 4,117 yuan. Then, it was heard that the foreign exchange had turned flat, and Qian Dui Ye and others came to scoop up slightly, reaching 4,125 yuan. However, a certain gold number seized the opportunity to sell off again, and in addition, a certain bank also sold on behalf of retail investors, until noon, it fell to a low of 4,118 yuan.

### Treat People with Utmost Sincerity

— Huang Jiayin

Whether in doing things, treating people, or handling affairs, you must treat people with utmost sincerity.

Sincerity is the mark of character, a representation of "genuine goods at fair prices, no deception of children or the elderly."

No one believes those who do not trust themselves, so you must treat people with utmost sincerity. Treat people with a sincere and trusting attitude, and people will surely believe you.

Lack of ability and knowledge can sometimes be excused. But lack of sincerity is inexcusable.

Let the world know that you are upright and sincere, that your "goods" are reliable, then your "business" will surely prosper, your "customers" will be endless, and you will have the joy of being too busy to handle everything.

Sincerity cannot be bought with money. A sincere person, like a magnet, will attract people, attract opportunities, and attract work.

Perhaps you failed yesterday, that doesn't matter. The most important thing is today. What attitude will you use to treat people and handle affairs today?

Try using a new tool. Try using a new power—the power of sincerity—to treat people and handle affairs. In this way, the efforts you spend will surely not be in vain. You will not disappoint others, and others will not disappoint you.

Therefore, please treat people with utmost sincerity!

### Casual Talk on Suicide

— Chen Shichao

Suicide is a major problem currently facing psychologists, sociologists, and physicians. Superficially, the reasons for suicide are nothing more than economic bankruptcy, incurable diseases, career failure, being shamed and humiliated, and disappointment in love. In fact, these are all secondary. To understand the primary reasons, one must delve into the individual's personality. Because seeking "a final resting place" is not a manifestation of moral cowardice, but rather a conflict in psychology and spirit.

In terms of methods of suicide, women mostly use hanging, drowning, and poisoning. Men use more violent methods such as pistols, knives, and swords. However, Japanese men also often use hanging, jumping off cliffs, and drowning. Their most unique method is seppuku (ritual suicide). In Africa, men mostly use firearms, while women prefer poisoning.

Suicide is a complex act, and mental factors must be investigated. When a person reaches old age and their future prospects are bleak, they naturally turn to suicide. Most suicides are committed by people over the age of forty-five. Men are four times more likely to commit suicide than women. This is because women have a stronger sense of family, which forces them to oppose suicide. Furthermore, the mental distress experienced by women due to social, economic, political, and other problems is not as severe as that of men.

In terms of seasons, summer is the time when most suicides occur, and 80% of suicides take place during the daytime.

The main causes of suicide must be traced to the depths of the subconscious. Because when faced with the same kind of misfortune, some people remain calm, while others have no choice but to commit suicide, it shows that the reasons for deciding to commit suicide are subjective.

Unbeknownst to a person's spirit, many contradictory phenomena are occurring. These phenomena are mostly the result of childhood experiences. A child inevitably has various desires, but is often disappointed. Therefore, the child develops a resentment towards those who hinder the realization of their desires, usually their parents, and even a desire for their death.

The repressed death wish and mental resentment and hatred from childhood, when reaching adulthood, can turn into mental distress and confusion, then into self-contradiction and cruelty, ultimately leading to suicide. Federn said in his book "Suicide": "Suicide is clearly the result of a subconscious moral impulse. This impulse compels people to feel that they must punish themselves with death. This is what they wanted to inflict on their parents in their childhood. Therefore, suicide becomes a fair retribution. The saying "Those who do not wish death on others will not commit suicide" is the reason for this.

Any experiences or emotions that have a negative impact on a person's mental health must be treated with psychotherapy to dispel the disharmony in their heart or the contradictions in their spirit.

### Story of a Madman

— Xia Chu

After the outbreak of the European War, Germany evacuated public institutions in Saarbrücken and other cities, and a hospital for the mentally ill was also evacuated. It is said that originally, among the lunatics in the hospital, three or four claimed to be Hitler, but after the war broke out, these lunatics were self-aware. During the evacuation, only twelve merchants claimed to be Hitler.

When Hitler marched into Vienna, the founder of psychoanalysis, Freud, could not live in peace because he was Jewish and fled to London in a panic. At that time, an American newspaper reported the event with the headline: "The Madhouse Expels the Doctor."

### Renowned German General Moltke

— Li Shaozhong

In a recent telegram issued by our national leader President Chiang to primary school principals, teachers, and people from all walks of life, he quoted a famous saying from General Moltke. General Moltke said after winning the Franco-Prussian War that the victory should be attributed to the primary school teachers of the country, which was widely circulated and considered to be an accurate assessment. What kind of person was this General Moltke? Readers must be eager to know. —Editor

The German army's elite and combat prowess became world-renowned after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Moltke, the commander-in-chief during the Franco-Prussian War, was not only the first famous general in the German army, but also one of the most outstanding staff generals in the history of modern armies.

Moltke was born on October 26, 1800, into a noble German family. His father moved to Holstein in 1805 and became a Danish citizen. Unfortunately, in that same year, his country house suffered from the "raid" disaster, and his house in the town of Lübeck was looted by the French, causing the family to decline. Therefore, the young Moltke grew up in a very poor environment. At the age of eleven, he was sent to an army school in the Danish capital to study. In 1818, he joined the Danish army. But when he was twenty years old, he decided to join the Prussian army. At the age of twenty-three, he entered the advanced war college, and his grades were excellent upon graduation. In 1831, he was transferred to the staff headquarters in Berlin.

Moltke loved to study literature and history, and especially enjoyed traveling. He published a novel "Two Friends" and many papers on international political geography and war. In 1832, he signed a contract with a bookstore to translate Gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" into German, with a royalty of seventy-five pounds. His original plan was to earn this money to buy a good horse. In eighteen months, he translated nine volumes, with three volumes remaining unfinished. However, the bookstore owner was unable to publish the book, so Moltke only received twenty-five pounds.

In 1835, he received six months of leave and went to travel in Southeast Europe. After a short stay in Constantinople, he remained in the Turkish army with the approval of the Berlin authorities. During this period, he constantly wrote letters to his mother and sister, which he later revised and published. One of his sisters married an Englishman living in Holstein as his second wife. The good husband had a daughter from his previous wife, named Mary Burt, who often read Moltke's letters at her stepmother's house. When Moltke returned from abroad, he proposed to Mary, and it was quickly successful. The wedding was held in 1841. Moltke had two children.

The Franco-Prussian War suddenly broke out in 1870, but Moltke had already begun collecting reports in 1857 to plan for this inevitable war. Because of the success of Moltke's strategy in the Austro-Prussian War of 1886, his position in this war was further strengthened. Five days after the mobilization order for the Prussian and South German armies was issued on July 15, 1870, he was appointed as the Chief of the General Staff of the General Headquarters. On June 16 of the following year, he was ennobled as Field Marshal. He died suddenly on April 24, 1891.

### What Are You Afraid Of?

— Luo Daoai

When humans are born, they only have two fears: first, fear of falling; second, fear of loud noises. Later, as they gradually grow up, they become afraid of other things.

Fear can hinder digestion, disrupt the work of the heart, affect physical development, and sometimes cause heart disease. Many scientists believe that high blood pressure is often caused by anxiety and fright.

One psychologist studied fear, and the results showed that children who grow up in wealthy families are more afraid of falling, more afraid of noises, more afraid of diseases, and more afraid of death than children from poor families.

Fear can cause blood vessels to constrict, cause paleness, and cause the heart to beat very rapidly.

When psychologists were studying psychology, they once asked many people what they were afraid of. As a result, more than 15% of people were afraid of animals in their childhood. In addition, what they were afraid of was: accidents, injuries caused by accidents, personal shortcomings or personal failures, being alone in a dark place, and times of pain.

Sometimes children can also develop fear indirectly. For example, a child used to like to play with rabbits. When he was happily playing with the rabbits, a loud noise suddenly startled him. He then got a bad impression, and from then on, whenever he saw rabbits, he would naturally be afraid.

It is not abnormal for children to be afraid of dark places. This is a human instinct, because ancient humans, for fear of enemy attacks, often had all kinds of fears in their hearts whenever it was dark.

The fear of the dentist's chair is probably the most difficult of all human fears to control.

### Seeking Knowledge

— You Qing

Knowledge is not private property, nor is it an ornament. Those who wear doctoral caps should not be proud, and those who are abandoned outside the school gate should not be sad.

Seeking knowledge is a kind of happiness, but also a hardship. Without diligence and hard work, without seeking to understand, "getting through in a day" or "getting through in a month" will ultimately not succeed.

Knowledge can be acquired anytime, anywhere. Experience is the most valuable knowledge.

Everyone should strive to seek knowledge. If circumstances do not allow them to run into school, they can pursue knowledge in many ways.

The purpose of seeking knowledge should be to serve society. If one seeks knowledge for the sake of getting promoted and making a fortune, then all the knowledge in one's life is false.

Knowledge advances along with the times. One must constantly train oneself and improve oneself in order not to fall behind.
