### US HOLDS SPECIAL MEETING TO DISCUSS STEPS TO AID CHINA AND BRITAIN. IMPORTANT ECONOMIC MEASURES ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION. BRITAIN AND THE UNITED STATES MAINTAIN CLOSE CONTACT ON THE FAR EAST.

London: British Foreign Secretary Butler told the House of Commons yesterday that Britain and the United States are maintaining the closest contact on all issues of common interest in the Far East, including naval and similar defense matters. However, Butler declined to disclose details of recent talks between US Secretary of State Hull and British Ambassador to the US, Lord Lothian. (International News Agency, 5th)

Washington: On Tuesday night, key US government officials held a special meeting. Nine of the most important government personnel attended, including Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Commerce Secretary and Federal Loan Administrator Jones, as well as Army Chief of Staff Marshall, Secretary of War Stimson, and Secretary of the Navy Knox. It is widely believed that the discussions focused on Britain's finances and new steps for US aid to Britain. Jones told reporters yesterday that he considers it appropriate to invest in Britain for legitimate purposes. When asked if the Johnson Act, which prohibits loans to countries that have defaulted on war debts, should be repealed, Jones replied that it was not yet the time. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced yesterday that British Treasury Secretary Phillips will come here to meet with US Treasury officials and present the latest available information. It is believed that Phillips's arrival will help clarify the situation. Special meetings of key government officials have been held three times before, and each meeting has been followed by significant moves to aid Britain. The first meeting was followed by the exchange of destroyers for bases, the second by the facilitation of increased aircraft purchases by Britain up to 12,000, and the third by the supply of Flying Fortresses to Britain. Therefore, the result of this meeting is certain to be financial assistance from the United States to Britain. However, Jones announced shortly after the meeting adjourned on Tuesday night that he does not advocate lending to Britain now or in the near future to finance its war effort. (Reuters, 5th)

Washington: US economic aid to China and Britain was the focus of attention in Washington diplomatic and financial circles yesterday. The United States is currently considering the possibility of providing economic assistance to Britain in some form. Federal Loan Administrator Jones said that Britain is "taking a worthwhile gamble." Jones declined to specify how and when such aid would occur, but he reiterated his opposition to repealing the Johnson Act. His policy is to use government funds for "worthwhile ventures when they are needed for legitimate purposes." Britain says they need financial resources. "It was very clear that important economic measures were being considered when four cabinet members, including Jones, held a meeting in Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's office on Tuesday. Strengthening China's finances to economic assistance is one of the most important international financial issues for Treasury officials at present. Morgenthau said after attending a joint congressional committee on Monday that once this aid is launched, it will proceed as quickly as possible. Jones said yesterday that China has already repaid $5 million of the $12 million it previously borrowed in the United States. Most of this repayment was in the form of tung oil imports. He pointed out that several hundred thousand dollars were for tin transport and said, "China should speed up mining." President Roosevelt's announced $50 million loan last week will provide substantial assistance to General Chiang Kai-shek's National Government in its war of resistance against Japan, and it is also considered here to be one of the most effective ways for the United States to help its Far Eastern interests. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Eccles, through a spokesman, denied the news published in the New York Herald Tribune that Eccles had recommended a $250 million loan to Britain, with gold production from the British Empire over the next five years as collateral.

Washington: Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced yesterday that British Treasury Secretary Sir Frederick Phillips had arrived in the United States to report to him on Britain's economic situation.

Washington: Senator George, a Democratic Senator from Georgia and chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated here yesterday that US industry should immediately adopt a "wartime, 14-hour work system" to accelerate the production of military supplies for its own use and for Britain. Senator George made the above suggestion after three cabinet members revealed that the US government is seriously studying Britain's need for increased wartime assistance. Shortly after this statement was made, George put forward the above opinion. Britain's need for ships, aircraft, and munitions is increasing daily. After consideration by Washington, the significant developments include the following: (1) Secretary of Commerce and Loan Administrator Jones declared that the British government is a "hopeful bettor" and wants to "borrow what is necessary for legitimate spending" to complete its hopeful bet. (2) Secretary of State Hull revealed that the US government is seriously considering Britain's need for merchant ships. (3) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced that British Treasury Secretary Phillips had arrived in New York from London. This trip is to "provide the US Treasury with the most recent reports available" regarding British finances and wartime needs. (4) The Maritime Commission stated that since the start of the war, the commission has successively approved the transfer of 130 cargo ships to Britain. The United States still has 63 idle ships, which can also be obtained if Britain wants to purchase them. (International News Agency, 5th)

San Francisco: Republican Senator Johnson said yesterday that "there is no doubt that the United States will eventually join the war because the officials in power are ready to 'engage in this kind of game.'" He also said that the Johnson Act advocates not providing credit to countries that defaulted on war debts from the last great war. If the act is amended, there will be "huge conflicts" between countries after peace arrives. (United Press, 5th)

Thirty foreign companies are involved. This collusion began in 1920 and lasted until September 1939. (Reuters, 5th)

However, on the Soviet side, the Soviet government considers it necessary to declare that its policy towards China has not changed. (Reuters, 5th)

Editorial

### THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SINO-JAPANESE PROBLEM TO PROGRESS IN A STRAIGHT LINE

Based on the attitudes towards the Sino-Japanese problem taken by the Soviet Union and Germany after the signing of documents in Moscow, as reported yesterday and today, the objective significance of the problem, that is, the significance of the problem as it is reflected in the hearts and minds of the world and recognized by the world, has become clearer and more distinct. This is beneficial to the good current state of the problem and is a new atmosphere in recent days, worthy of further discussion.

The significance of the Sino-Japanese problem was originally very simple and had long been understood by honest, virtuous, and unbiased people. However, there are many who maliciously slander, deliberately distort, or pretend to be deaf and dumb for ulterior motives. Therefore, from the July 7th Incident to today, exactly forty-one months, though not long, it seems that there is still cloudiness obscuring a part of the view. Those who take advantage of the cloudiness make it seem as if the whole situation is chaotic and confusing, to attempt to attack under the cover of smoke and try to fish in troubled waters. For example, it is said that China's resistance is not an anti-aggression to strive for independent survival, but a link in the mutual war of imperialism; not a conscious self-defense and national war for liberation, but instigated and merely acting as the vanguard for some imperialists; not striving for national freedom, but a sacrifice under the command of the Third International's world revolution policy; not exclusively against frontal aggression, but following Britain and the United States while opposing Germany and Italy. These absurd accusations are intended to undermine China's resistance, conceal Japan's atrocities, and disrupt international relations through strategic machinations. Thus, the flames of the European and Asian wars are gradually approaching each other in form, and in concept, the struggle between Britain and Germany is deliberately equated with China's war of resistance against Japan. In China, the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party within the unity of spirit is referred to as being red or controlled by the Communist Party. Internationally, China is criticized for being a tool because of the common interests of China and various European and American countries in the Far East. Moreover, these complicated excuses are used in multiple ways, regardless of contradictions, in an attempt to: divide China, win over the Soviet Union, exclude Britain and the United States, and slander China and Germany. Even though the attempts are often ineffective, and the original meaning of China's resistance and the Sino-Japanese problem has not changed in the slightest as a result, it is not entirely without a slight effect. Consequently some people in the international community have been misled and slightly changed their objective understanding of the Sino-Japanese problem. Even though the change in view cannot have any impact on the problem itself, the presence of cloudiness has led to all kinds of naive tactics, ineffective temptations, schemes and conspiracies, transfers and borrowings, emerging endlessly, causing the problem to undergo unnecessary twists and turns. Some are just deceiving themselves, and will eventually see their own mistakes. However, if one does not deceive oneself or make mistakes, one can reduce many twists and turns. Wouldn't that be better? Now, we are gradually entering a better state of removing the dross, cutting out the unnecessary, and clearing away the thorns! It is not only that every action of the United States is meaningful and full of strength, but also that after the recent decision to lend 100 million US dollars to China, Secretary of State Hull clearly declared the importance of the loan agreement with China, and considered that under the current circumstances, this is the "minimum" that the United States can do. The German News Agency reported that this is the "first" measure of the new US policy, and diplomatic circles in Washington said that China can "first" purchase 50 light bombers from the United States. The so-called minimum, the so-called first, and the so-called first all clearly reveal greater and more assistance in the future. The nature of the US repeatedly making loans, from commercial to political and military, is changing, and as the New York News Agency bluntly stated, "There is a general feeling in the United States that any possible aid to China should be part of the US national defense program itself." This is clear evidence that US policy will not allow the Sino-Japanese problem to continue its chaos. It is well known that Britain will act in concert with the United States. However, what is most likely to make the significance of the Sino-Japanese problem clear and distinct is undoubtedly the reported attitude of the Soviet Union and Germany. Regarding the Soviet Union, the Japanese side denied the intention of stationing Japanese troops in North China and Inner Mongolia and declared to the Soviet Union that anti-communism was not aimed at the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Ambassador to Japan, representing the Soviet government, not only replied but further stated that the Soviet Union's policy towards China remains unchanged, that is, continuing to aid China. Regarding Germany, although Germany signed an alliance with Japan due to the overall international relationship, Japan used this to swagger in the Far East. However, Germany did not blindly follow its ally Japan because of the alliance relationship. It has now indicated that it has no intention of recognizing the Nanjing regime and maintains its original diplomatic relations with the Chongqing National Government. It can be seen that the axis in Germany's mind is by no means used as a lever to harm China like Japan. The combination of multiple parties in the international community has completed the work of clearing away the cloudiness, making the Sino-Japanese problem not only clear and distinct in significance but also making its future evolution only tend towards a simple path. It proves that Japan's past efforts have been diminishing day by day and warns Japan not to waste its efforts in the future. As for the future evolution, it should be in the current state and atmosphere, not allowing for detours, no more twists and turns, but only developing in a straight line!

### FIERCE FIGHTING IN SOUTHEASTERN PENGZE - JAPANESE TROOPS INVADE CHINA IN FOUR ROUTES - CHINESE TROOPS COUNTER-ATTACK AND RECAPTURE TWO STRONGHOLDS

Chongqing: According to news received here, there is currently fierce fighting near Pengze, downstream of Jiujiang. It is reported that Japanese troops attacked Chinese positions on the south bank of the Yangtze River. It is said that Chinese troops had threatened Japanese ships traveling between Shanghai and Hankou. After Japanese reinforcements arrived in Jiujiang on seven warships, the Japanese troops in Pengze, under the cover of aircraft, artillery, and warships, launched a four-pronged attack on Chinese troops southeast of Pengze near the Anhui-Jiangsu border. (Reuters, 5th)

Tunxi: After the Japanese launched an offensive from Zhizhi, from the 21st to the 27th, the Japanese were unable to withstand the fierce counter-attack of the Chinese army and retreated across the entire front. On the 30th, they reinforced Pengze with several thousand troops from Jiujiang with six or seven warships. On the 1st, they launched a four-pronged attack on the Chinese positions in the Pengze area. The main routes of attack were: one route attacking Malukou east of Pengze, and one route attacking Huangtuling south of Pengze. On the morning of the 2nd, more than 800 Japanese east of Pengze, wielding their fierce artillery fire, invaded Chinese territory, advancing and retreating without success. The vanguard is still lingering in the area north of Guojiaqiao. More than 2,000 Japanese troops began to attack Huangtuling south of Pengze on the 2nd, with the cover of aircraft and artillery. The Chinese army fought bravely, and are currently engaged in fierce fighting in Nuer Mountain, south of Huangtuling. (Dispatch, 4th)

A part of them retreated to Tailuan Village, and was again attacked by the Chinese army, retreating again to Phoenix Mountain. However, the Chinese army's offensive was fierce, and Phoenix Mountain was recaptured again. At 8:00 am, Japanese planes came to bomb, attempting to cover the retreat of the remaining Japanese troops, but they were unable to succeed under the Chinese army's surveillance. (Dispatch, 4th)

The purpose was to attack the central and northern routes of the Chinese army and break through the Chinese defense. The Japanese army used a division from Suixian in northern Hubei, three divisions from Zhongxiang, Jingmen, and Changyang, and reinforcements from Nanjing and Hankou. The Chinese army has not been demoralized by the Japanese peace offensive and is still waiting at the foot of the Dabie Mountains, about 30 and 50 kilometers from the Japanese base, and has defeated the Japanese offensive, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army. The Japanese attacks in the area have now ceased and they have returned to Zhongxiang, Jingmen, and Dangyang. (United Press, 5th)

### Vietnam Denies French Planes Bombed Thailand; France Hopes for Peaceful Resolution to Vietnam-Thailand Dispute; Thai Newspaper Demands Government Take Strong Action

Hanoi: The Vietnamese government has announced that all indigenous leaders of the Cochin China uprising have been arrested. The government denies reports from Bangkok that French planes bombed Thai cities. It also claims that Thai machine gun fire reached the French guardhouse in Poipet (transliteration) yesterday. While the machine gun fire occurred, three Thai planes circled over Poipet. Herman, a Dutch reporter for a Dutch East Indies newspaper, was allegedly killed by a man believed to be a Thai native who rushed into the guardhouse; the perpetrator immediately escaped into the darkness. There have been no recent reports of incidents or hostilities along the border, and war activities have ceased. However, internal communications are difficult, making it difficult to obtain immediate news from the nearly 2,000-mile border. Despite the tense situation, officials express optimism about the ongoing negotiations in Bangkok by the French Minister to Thailand, Garreau. The progress of the negotiations is unknown due to obstructed communication between Hanoi and Bangkok. Yesterday, the government announced that multiple indigenous uprisings had occurred in the three western provinces of Cochin China, while uprisings in eastern Cochin China had decreased due to suppression. In the northern border of Cochin China, twenty indigenous military officers were killed, nine went missing, and twenty-one were injured during suppression by authorities. There are also disturbances in northern Indochina. In Tokyo and Annam, forty-eight alleged communists have been arrested. Suppression is currently underway in northern Tokyo to deal with indigenous bandits who looted Lang Son and organized uprisings. (United Press, 5th)

Bangkok: Military authorities here recently stated that if the situation worsens, Thai troops could occupy Luang Prabang (transliteration) and Pakse (transliteration) in Vietnam within 24 hours. Even if there is any French resistance along the Mekong River, Thailand can enter Vietnamese territory without significant effort. The French have not built defenses on the right bank of the Mekong River, and Thailand's demands do not extend beyond the Mekong. When demanding the return of Luang Prabang (transliteration) and Pakse (transliteration), the Thai government stated that if France lost sovereignty over Laos and Eastern Cambodia, these previously Thai territories should be returned to Thailand. These territories were taken from Thailand by France in 1893, as they would only allow France to occupy a narrow strip of the Vietnamese coast. It is reported that a large number of Thai troops in the east have concentrated in Udon (transliteration), opposite Vientiane (transliteration), and in the west, they have concentrated in Ubon (transliteration), opposite Pakse (transliteration), with troops increasing daily. In addition, five hundred planes have been sent to Ubon, and the government recently announced that it had dispatched fifty-eight planes to patrol the border. The government's announcement stated that sending planes to the border was necessary because French planes frequently violate Thai territory. Military authorities here, considering the ongoing indigenous unrest in Vietnam, increasingly believe that if an invasion of Vietnam becomes necessary, the anti-French unrest within Vietnam may aid Thailand's success. According to official border news, numerous Annamese troops have betrayed the French army and pledged allegiance to the Thai army. Thai military circles predict that in the event of war, indigenous troops within the French army will defect from the French and side with Thailand. In a recent speech, Thai Prime Minister Songgram expressed hope that the Annamese would assist Thailand, stating that Annam could become an independent country again once the Far East situation reaches a final resolution. Newspapers here continue to criticize France and demand that the government take military action if France refuses to return Luang Prabang and Pakse to Thailand. (United Press, 5th)

Bangkok: Thai newspapers recently demanded that the government take "strong action to counter France's repeated barbaric acts of aggression." These newspaper opinions were published after the Thai Supreme Command announced an incident on the border. The Supreme Command stated that French Moroccan troops shelled Thai troops in Ban Don, a place on the Mekong River, yesterday. Thai troops did not return fire due to the long distance. (United Press, 5th)

Vichy: Officials announced that there has been no continuing tension on the Thai-Vietnamese border recently. The French Minister to Thailand, Garreau, is currently negotiating with Thai officials. The French government has high hopes for a peaceful resolution to the Thai-Vietnamese issue, believing it will not sacrifice Vietnamese territory. (United Press, 5th)

Hong Kong: Reuters learned today from responsible sources that Thai inspectors have now banned the sending and receiving of coded telegrams. (Reuters, 5th)

Hanoi: From November 23rd to December 3rd, Vietnamese military and police authorities conducted a communist purge in Cochin China. Many of the party's troublemakers were hiding in rural areas. After a thorough search by the military and police, four were killed and many arrested. Several indigenous leaders and police officers who were kidnapped by the communists and taken to the countryside have now been rescued. In addition, a group of rioters in Giang Thanh Province (transliteration) attempted to set fire to several residences of indigenous leaders and a post office branch, and military and police authorities are arresting them. (Havas, 4th)

Hanoi: Dutch journalist Herman was attempting to enter Thailand from Ha Tien town on the Vietnamese-Cambodian border last night when he was mistakenly identified as a customs official from Ha Tien by the Thai side, who opened fire, shooting him in the chest. He was immediately transported to Battambang for treatment but died in the ambulance due to the severity of his injuries. Several hours later, the residence of the customs official was strafed by Thai soldiers with machine guns. This morning, three Thai planes flew over the town again. (Havas, 4th)

### Free China Increases Steel Production

Chongqing: The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently released a public announcement stating that steel production in the Free Area this year has increased by 30% compared to last year. In terms of pig iron, the average daily production last year was about ten tons. Although the actual production figures for this year are unknown, based on general estimates, they are certainly higher than last year. It can be confidently asserted that as rear area industries flourish, this steel production will be insufficient for distribution. However, it is expected that by the end of this year, there will be enough steel to meet the urgent needs of the military and industry. (Havas, 4th)

Chongqing: Today, a spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs, referring to the meeting of Chinese steel experts in Chongqing on Tuesday, stated that by the end of 1941, China will have sufficient steel to meet most of its military and industrial needs.

### Greek Army Launches New Offensive on Albanian Central Front; Tirana Faces Severe Threat; Greek Army Cuts Off Italian Army's Retreat; Rumor of Establishment of Albanian Republic in Korçë

Sofia: Athens Radio reported yesterday that the Greek army is making continuous progress. Italian troops have abandoned their new defense line north of Pogradec and are retreating towards Elbasan, 24 miles from Tirana. On the central front, the Greek army launched an effective new offensive against the Italian army, which is fiercely resisting. In southern Albania, the Italian army abandoned large amounts of military supplies and collapsed, and hundreds were captured. The Greek army has also made gains in Moscopole. Since occupying Pogradec, the Greek army has placed significant pressure on the Italian army. Greek air force planes are continuously bombing the retreating Italian troops. (United Press, 5th)

Yugoslav Border: The advance guard of the Greek army in Albania, which was captured far from its base, is now experiencing some difficulties with supplies. The area near the Yugoslav border was very peaceful yesterday. The terrain in this area is very difficult, and the roads are blocked by snow, making passage almost impossible. Yesterday morning, two Italian soldiers and three Albanian soldiers surrendered to the Yugoslav authorities at the border. According to the Italian soldiers, the morale of the Italian army is declining daily. According to the Albanian soldiers, the Italian army in Albania is now arbitrarily abusing civilians. (Reuters, 5th)

Struga, Yugoslavia: Since the heavy snowfall on Tuesday night, all mountain roads in the war zone have been buried in snow, hindering military operations. The heavy snowfall has not stopped throughout the region. In the Kefasan district, the Greek army is advancing along the northbound highway towards Elbasan and has occupied two small villages along the way. The Greek army in the Argyrokastro district crossed the Drin River near Vanishta and has occupied the village of Libohovë. The Italian army is retreating towards the village of Sofratikë. In the Opari region, the Italian army is resisting fiercely. Near the village of Mallakastra, they repelled the Greek army, which had advanced nine kilometers on Tuesday. The Greek army suffered 100 soldiers and 3 officers killed. The Italian army also suffered heavy casualties. In the Konispol region, the Greek army is advancing towards Bënjës and has advanced eight kilometers, now only eight kilometers from the village. (United Press, 5th)

Sant' Agata d' Esaro: Yesterday, Greek troops, through bombing and artillery fire, drove the Italian army out of their strongholds in Porto Edda and Argyrokastro. Under heavy Greek attacks, the Italian army rapidly retreated, and the escape route along the highway north to Delvinë and Argyrokastro has been cut off by the Greek army. Italian troops were forced to flee along coastal routes, suffering heavy losses. Greek forces claim they have captured countless military supplies. A reporter stood beside Greek artillerymen with bloodshot eyes, who seemed to have not slept for days but remained tireless, manning their artillery positions and continuously shelling the enemy, frequently requesting more shells. Recently, Italian planes flew over us, searching for artillery positions. They dropped 150 bombs and were quickly chased away by Greek reconnaissance planes. (United Press, 5th)

Athens: This morning, reports indicate that the Italian army is in full retreat from Porto Edda, Argyrokastro, and Premeti, key strongholds in southern Albania. The Greek army is poised to occupy the above three cities within days. The Greek army in the north, advancing in two routes, threatens Tirana and Elbasan. It is reported to have reached the Shkumbin River. After a fierce battle in a day-long blizzard, the severe threat to Tirana is even more apparent. The Greek army seems to have destroyed the Italian army's desperate resistance and breached a section of the Italian front line west of Pogradec. It is rumored that the Greek army annihilated two of the Italian army's elite regiments before breaking through the breach. Furthermore, several bridgehead fortifications have been built near the upstream of the Shkumbin River, along the highway that runs parallel to Elbasan, forty miles west. It is understood that the Greek army in the southern coastal area surrounded Porto Edda and, after a day-long fierce battle, is only hundreds of yards from the seaport. It is widely expected that the fall of the city is imminent. (International News, 5th)

Athens: According to reliable sources from Zurich, Switzerland, Greek patrols entered the outskirts of Sarandë last night, a major military town in southern Albania. (United Press, 5th)

Athens: It was confirmed here yesterday that, as of December 2nd, the Greek army had captured 7,000 Italian soldiers. It was also learned from authoritative sources that the Greek army has captured no fewer than a thousand Italian soldiers in recent days. It was also learned that when the Greek army occupied Pogradec, the number of Italian soldiers captured was small because the Italians began withdrawing from the city last week. (United Press, 5th)

Southern Capital: According to news from the front lines received by Southern newspapers, after Pogradec was occupied by the Greek army on the 3rd, several positions northwest of the city were recaptured by the Italian army yesterday morning but were subsequently reoccupied by the Greek army in a counterattack. The northern position of the Greek army, starting from Tepe Lena in the west, extends to the source of the Shkumbin River, and from Mount Gamilas to the Devol River, connecting with Argyrokastro in the northwest. Yesterday, the Italian army's artillery shelled Greek positions throughout the day. (Haitong, 5th)

Yugoslav Capital: According to unconfirmed reports, the Greek government established the Albanian Republic in Korçë yesterday. (United Press, 5th)

Greek Army Achieves New Victory, Occupies Bonah Forest

London: Suppressed news from Athens states that the Greek army reached the city of Santi Quaranta (a base for Italian aggression in southern Albania) yesterday. Italian troops are continuously retreating in various areas of the front, and the Greek army is gradually advancing, seemingly poised to drive all Italian troops out of the Balkans. The Italian side is trying to contain the situation but seems to be failing everywhere. London received unconfirmed news yesterday stating that, in order to extricate itself from the difficulties it faces, the Italian government has ordered the mobilization of thousands of able-bodied men. Meanwhile, it is reported that the Greek army has achieved new victories near Argyrokastro and north of the Yugoslav border. The so-called "daredevil battalion" of the Italian Folgore Division was defeated after a fierce battle overnight, and the Greek army occupied the Bonah Forest. This battle is of great significance, as it greatly facilitates the Greek army's advance towards Argyrokastro (the only remaining major base of the Italian vanguard in Albania). The Greek army in other areas, despite encountering stubborn resistance from the Italian army, also achieved similar victories. The Greek army on the northern route has also occupied several heights north of Mount Ostrovicë, driving back Italian units holding deep trenches and strong fortifications. The Italian army then attempted to counterattack near Lake Ohrid but was repelled, with many captured. It is believed that this battle will also have a significant impact on future wars. According to captured Italian soldiers, Italian officials in Albania have indeed implemented terror tactics to secure defenses, and there have been instances of executions after every decisive defeat. The results of the Greek army's operations in the past 36 hours have created several pocket-shaped positions, with their front lines extending deep into southern Albania, forming a large egg shape. Yesterday, the Greek army continued to press the Italian army north of Santi Quaranta and Argyrokastro, which retreated from Premeti towards Këlcyrë and Tepelenë, harassed by planes along the way. The Greek army, which was very close to Premeti in the morning, continued to advance. The Italian army's resistance in the area around Moscopole, southwest of Pogradec, where fierce fighting had been taking place for several days, has also weakened. North of Pogradec, the Greek army has occupied villages on the shores of Lake Ohrid. However, responsible Greek newspapers warn the public not to be overly optimistic, stating that even larger battles lie ahead. (Reuters, 5th)

Budapest: Greek radio reported that British and Greek aircraft bombed Tirana, the capital of Albania, yesterday. British and Greek aircraft also shot down seventeen Italian planes in the northern front amidst heavy Italian anti-aircraft fire and attacked Italian troops retreating in disarray towards Elbasan in central Albania. The radio continued that, despite adverse weather conditions and Italian resistance, the Greek army has taken control of the entire front line. On the southern front, the Italian army has been forced to abandon several important military points to avoid capture. The Greek army also defeated two battalions of the Italian Besaglieri Division in the Konispol salient in the Argyrokastro area, capturing countless artillery pieces and military equipment. According to news from Athens via Zurich, Greek troops entered Sarandë, a major city in southern Albania, last night. Furthermore, according to a public announcement from the Ministry of Public Security, Italian planes bombed Përmet on Wednesday, causing minor deaths and injuries among non-combatants and slight damage to houses. Also, news from Sofia stated that after the Greek army's advance, the Italian army abandoned its new position north of Pogradec and retreated towards Elbasan, and that the Greek army had made progress on all fronts. According to news from Belgrade, Greek troops captured more than 3,500 Italian soldiers on the roads along the west bank of Lake Ohrid. The Athens government announced that the Greek army captured more than 400 Italian soldiers when occupying the plateau north of Pogradec. It also stated that as a result of fierce fighting in the mountains west of Pogradec, the Greek army occupied Premeti and captured more than 500 Italian soldiers. (United Press, 5th)

Greek Army Captures Mountains, Italian Army Retreats West

Athens: Last night's Greek communique stated that the Greek army had occupied Premeti, causing heavy losses to the Italian army. The Greek army captured more than 500 Italian soldiers, six artillery pieces, and countless military supplies. According to a Greek spokesman in Athens, the Italian army has abandoned new positions on several aspects of the Albanian front, apparently to avoid the Greek army's major encirclement operation. The most important Faleri range, northeast and directly north of Premeti, has fallen into the hands of the Greek army. The Italian army is now retreating west. The Italian army, guarding the heights northwest of Pogradec, collapsed and retreated west after the Greek army charged with bayonets. The Greek army continues to advance in other areas. All Italian counterattacks have been repelled. Attempts by the Italian army to reorganize its front lines by increasing reinforcements have apparently failed. Maintaining joint operations between the various armies is becoming increasingly difficult. Greek planes are now bombing moving Italian vehicles over the entire line, and British planes have also joined in the cooperation. According to the Greek side, the Italian radio's claim that the Greek army will collapse once it operates on the plains is not necessarily true. The Greek army is not afraid of fighting the Italian army on the Albanian plains because the Greek army already has similar mechanized units to deal with the Italian army's motorized units. Moreover, the entire territory of Albania has high mountains, and the Greek army's strategy is to first capture the high ground and then control the plains. (Reuters, 5th)

Fierce Fighting on the Greek Front, Italian Planes Active

Rome: According to the Italian military headquarters, fierce fighting occurred on the Greek front yesterday. Italian planes assisted the army in operations, bombing military targets, roads, bridges, freight vehicles, and marching troops. The highway from Premeti to Berat was bombed and severed in several places. The islands of Corfu, Zante, and Preveza were also bombed by Italian planes. Italian planes fought fiercely with enemy planes, shooting down five enemy planes. Two Italian planes did not return. The Italian submarine "Telfino" sank a Greek destroyer in the Aegean Sea on November 29th. On the East African front, an attack by enemy mechanized units on Italian positions west of Tesenei has been repelled. Enemy planes attacked Scilla and Crotone, causing no damage or casualties. Italian fighters shot down an enemy plane. Enemy planes flying from Switzerland attacked Turin, killing one person and injuring three. A dye factory, a paper mill, and a textile factory were set on fire by the bombing but were quickly extinguished. No military targets were damaged. (Haitong, 5th)

### Italian Soldiers of All Ranks Summoned to Enlist

Rome: Yesterday, officials announced that all members of the militia aged 20 and 21 have been called up to strengthen the Italian army.

### Economic Cooperation Agreement Signed Between Germany and Romania; Ten-Year Economic Construction Plan Implemented

Berlin According to the official gazette released here last night, Germany and Romania have now agreed to closer economic cooperation. After weeks of negotiations, a new agreement was signed in Berlin on the 3rd of this month, allowing Germany and Romania to cooperate and assist Romania in a ten-year economic construction plan. The representatives who signed the new agreement were Mr. Clodius, Director of the Economic Department of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Galatianu, the Romanian Minister to Germany, and Mr. Dimitrie, head of the Romanian economic delegation. When the Romanian State Leader Antonescu and Minister of Economy Cancicov visited Berlin, they personally participated in the negotiations to discuss important issues. One of the most important parts of the agreement is the protocol on German-Romanian cooperation in the implementation of the ten-year plan, which was officially announced by the government last night. (5th, Huitong News Agency)

Berlin The protocol signed between Germany and Romania for the implementation of Romania's ten-year economic construction plan stipulates that Romania can seek assistance and cooperation from the German government when implementing this huge plan. The German government has expressed its willingness to assist Romania in its economic construction technically and financially. The main points of the protocol are as follows: (1) Germany will provide huge long-term loans necessary for Romania to implement the ten-year plan to assist Romania. (2) Germany will continue to cooperate with Romania in agriculture and forestry and will provide credit loans to Romania for the agricultural tools, machinery, and other agricultural equipment it needs. (3) Germany will provide technical and financial assistance to Romania to revitalize its industry. (4) Germany will provide credit loans to Romania for the materials and pipelines necessary to expand its railways and highways. (5) In addition to providing long-term loans, Germany will provide Romania's industry, banks, and trust businesses with the capital they need based on private economic cooperation. (6) At the request of Romania, the German government will send agricultural, industrial, technical, and other experts to Romania. (7) The German market will always sell Romanian products at fair prices, and the Romanian market will also promote business relations with Germany as a principle. (8) The governments of Germany and Romania expressed their satisfaction with the German-Romanian cooperation that has already begun and decided to guarantee mutually beneficial production cooperation. The protocol reveals that Romania's agricultural and industrial production will become more developed due to German economic cooperation. Therefore, Germany is expected to purchase large quantities of oil, grain, and livestock from Romania, which shows that this matter also has significant political implications for the British blockade measures. (5th, Huitong News Agency)

Bucharest Romanian newspapers praised the Berlin Protocol announced yesterday. The protocol stipulates Romania's ten-year economic construction plan, and Romania's economic prosperity can be expected soon. (5th, Huitong News Agency)

### Romanian Government Adopts Severe Measures to Control Romanian Oil Fields; Oil Pipelines in Romania Nationalized

Bucharest The Antonescu government took over all private oil pipelines in Romania yesterday to strengthen totalitarian control over Romania, which has been shaken by the recent Iron Guard riots. Those affected include the American Romanian Oil Company, a subsidiary of the New Jersey-based Mobil Oil Company of the United States, and companies with Jewish shareholders. The Romanian government also ordered the purchase of its inland river vessels, which are also operated by Jewish shareholders, further affecting British and American investment. Companies purchased by the government will be paid with Romanian government bonds with a term of 25 years and an interest rate of 3%. At the same time, it is reported that the government has adopted severe measures to remove Iron Guard extremists from various agencies. (5th, International Telegram)

Bucharest The government recently issued an order nationalizing all oil pipelines in the country. In the future, the construction of new pipelines will be handled by the government. (4th, Havas News Agency)

Bucharest In the first ten months of this year, Romania produced 4,943,000 tons of crude oil, and a total of 205,000 meters of new oil wells were drilled. If operations continue in the same situation in November and December, the oil production this year may reach 5.8 million tons, and the new oil wells may reach 240,000 meters. Compared with last year, oil production decreased by 7.05%, and new oil wells decreased by 625%. Daily oil production decreased from 1,700 truckloads in summer to 1,400 truckloads.

### Major Prison Break in Hungary; Attempt to Kidnap Regent Failed

Budapest The Hungarian National Prosecutor's Office has reportedly filed a public prosecution against Vers, a former Arrow Cross Party member who was arrested, and his comrades, on charges of attempting to kidnap Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy and using force to seize power and install Arrow Cross leader Szálasi as ruler. In addition to Vers, 23 other people were charged. The indictment stated that the group planned to use two large cars, each carrying 50 armed members, holding machine guns and automatic pistols, to sneak into the motorcycle guard unit, follow the Regent, arrest him, and imprison him. Other charges included plans to occupy radio stations, police stations, and various ministries. The trial will begin on December 16. (5th, Huitong News Agency)

### Hungarian Foreign Minister to Visit Southern Country

Southern Country Capital According to responsible authorities here last night, Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky will soon visit the Southern Country. Given the increasing friendship between the two countries, this is not an unusual move. The date of his arrival in the Southern Country and the arrangements for his reception have not been decided. According to well-informed sources, the Hungarian Foreign Minister may depart within ten days, as the two governments have already begun diplomatic negotiations. In early 1939, the Foreign Minister was preparing to come here to sign a treaty of non-aggression and friendship, but it did not happen due to the coup in the Southern Country and the outbreak of the European War. Political circles here believe that cooperation between the two countries is sufficient to maintain peace in Southeast Europe. It is believed here that the Foreign Minister's speech in Congress a few days ago was also of great help to peace in the Balkans. This policy of Southeast European countries is in line with the goals of the Axis powers and is of great value for the reorganization of Europe. (5th, Huitong News Agency)

### Trade Agreement Concluded Between Britain and Turkey; Has Political Nature

London Britain and Turkey have now concluded an agreement that is expected to increase trade between the two countries by facilitating the exchange of goods. The agreement stipulates that during the effective period, Britain and Turkey will make payments according to the current exchange rate between the pound sterling and the Turkish pound and will set up special accounts to facilitate commercial and other payments between the two countries. This agreement supplements the trade payment agreement signed between Britain and Turkey on February 2. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the new British-Turkish agreement is not only commercial in nature but also has a political nature. In practical terms, it is a challenge from the British government to Germany's economic dominance in the Balkan Peninsula. It is widely believed that Germany may make attractive commercial proposals to the Turkish government, but the conclusion of this agreement between Britain and Turkey will prevent Germany from regaining its dominance in Turkey's economic life. The British and Turkish governments held lengthy discussions before concluding this agreement, and Turkey's entire commercial relationship with Britain and its colonies was included to enable Britain to purchase agricultural products that are beneficial to Turkey's national economy. These purchases will amount to millions of pounds. The Turkish government and local authorities will also import goods needed by government agencies and commodities such as wool needed by manufacturers from Britain and its colonies. The British commercial company, which aims to promote trade between Britain and the Near East, will fully utilize its activities. This company is privately owned and has greatly expanded its scope since its establishment in April. (5th, Reuters)

### Soviet-Romanian Trade Negotiations Underway

Bucharest A delegation from the Soviet Port of Kiev Cooperative arrived here today and will negotiate with Romanian authorities to purchase freight cars, wood pulp, and paper to be transported to the province of Bessarabia. In addition, Romanian oil companies have signed an agreement with the Soviet Union to order large quantities of oil from the Soviet Union. (4th, Havas News Agency)

### Turkey Controls Grain

Ankara The Turkish government is planning to establish a new grain division within the Ministry of Trade to manage issues such as grain production, supply, distribution, and prices. The purpose of this move is obviously to prevent grain panics and to punish unscrupulous merchants who hoard grain. (5th, Huitong News Agency)

### British Weather Worsens; German Aircraft Activity Decreases; West Midlands Bombed

London There was very little activity by enemy aircraft over Britain yesterday. An Air Ministry communiqué stated that bombs fell in Dover shortly after noon, causing slight material damage and few casualties. British fighters shot down a German bomber off the Dutch coast. No British aircraft were lost. (5th, Reuters)

London Last night and early this morning, gloomy weather again halted German aircraft's attacks on Britain. German aircraft suddenly eased their blitz after only a few hours of bombing in the Midlands last night, presumably because of bad weather over the German airbases, making takeoff dangerous. There were no piercing air raid sirens in London all day Wednesday, and the night was also relatively quiet. The sirens were lifted before midnight, and London residents were able to enjoy a much-needed rest, awakening only to the sound of factory whistles at dawn. Dover and a town in eastern England were subjected to lighter air raids during the day, with almost no losses. One German aircraft was chased across the Channel and shot down. The aircraft crashed into the sea, engulfed in flames. (5th, International News Agency)

London Yesterday, central and coastal areas of Britain were again subjected to the atrocities of the German air force. A few "samples" also fell on London itself. After a relatively quiet day, groups of German aircraft flew over the British coast at dusk, selecting a city in the eastern Midlands as the main target for the night raid. After dropping a large number of bombs, the German aircraft groups flew south to other central areas. Officials here declared that the organized British counter-offensive had crippled most of the German railway network, and more than half of the coal in the Ruhr area was stockpiled and untransported due to a lack of transportation equipment. (5th, International Telegram)

### British Fighters Equipped with Steel Cannons

London British fighters are now equipped with steel cannons. Several German aircraft that were recently destroyed were shot down by this new type of weapon. The advantage of this steel cannon over machine guns is that it has a longer range and greater destructive power. It is reported that the United States will provide Britain with the famous American-made long-barreled 1.17-caliber steel cannon. (5th, Reuters)

A Tragic History of the European War (4)

### The Inside Story of How Déat and Reynaud's Affairs Misled the Country

I said to Reynaud, "If you are ordered to form a cabinet, you must also try to get the support of Daladier. He is still deeply loved by the people in the country!"

"That's because the people haven't understood what kind of person he is."

"Perhaps, but you must also consider the facts. Although you are talented, you have no followers. The Radical Party is still loyal to Daladier. Although you belong to the right wing, because you despise them and don't hide it, the right wing also tends to support Daladier."

He smiled slightly and said, "If the President orders me to form a cabinet, I will naturally try to keep Daladier as Minister of War." At ten o'clock, he went to the Chamber of Deputies. As Reynaud expected, Prime Minister Daladier resigned that evening. President Lebrun immediately summoned Reynaud and asked him to form a cabinet. He did not hesitate and immediately agreed. This time, that extremely intelligent person completely ignored public opinion and was out of touch with the times.

After Reynaud formed a cabinet and attended Parliament, he struggled with all his might and barely managed to secure a majority! Parliament did not like him and regretted overthrowing Daladier. Reynaud felt the strong hostile atmosphere and suddenly lost his usual confidence, and his speech was lackluster and perfunctory.

The next day, I returned to my defensive position in Arras and felt that everyone on the train was deeply surprised to hear that Reynaud had formed a cabinet. They all believed that this move was tantamount to challenging public opinion. It was indeed a matter that could not be ignored that the government and the majority of the people had such a rift in wartime. Since Reynaud took office as Prime Minister, I have not seen him once. Therefore, I used congratulations as an excuse and quoted a famous saying from the French revolutionary Barère to him: "In times of peace, Parliament represents the whole country, but in times of war, the army represents it." And added a sentence saying: "Don't lose contact with the army."

Since the outbreak of the war, Reynaud has expressed his opposition to Gamelin, saying that as commander-in-chief, he has not taken any action, and the army has no faith in him. It is also difficult to say whether these issues are right or wrong, so let's not discuss them for the time being. In September 1939, Gamelin did not launch a fierce attack on Germany's Siegfried Line, but only took cautious military action in the Saar region, which is a fact. His political enemies took the opportunity to say that at this time, most of the German troops were fighting in Poland, which was a great opportunity to attack. Gamelin believed that at the beginning of the war, France lacked the necessary equipment to launch an offensive and had no support from a large number of aircraft and heavy artillery. If it rashly attacked, it would suffer heavy losses.

Gamelin once said, "I don't want to start the war with the Battle of Verdun." He explained this sentence by saying, "France's population productivity was originally very low, and the last major war had already dealt a heavy blow, and it could not withstand the great bloodshed of the Battle of Verdun again. This war will be a scientific war, and everything can be predicted in advance. The casualties on both sides will inevitably be few."

I admit that at the time, I very much agreed with his attitude. Outsiders should not rashly criticize Gamelin's talent as a general. In the Battle of the Marne, he was a consultant to Marshal Joffre and was the first to see this clever plan to turn defeat into victory. He was an example of a colleague in the General Staff, and later he was able to command divisions on the battlefield and make people deeply admire him.

If you meet him for the first time, his elusive personality will surprise you. His two small mustaches are short and stiff, his eyes are small, and his lips are thin, with a mysterious and incredible color. He does not have the vigor of General Foch, nor the sincerity and attentiveness of General Joffre. He is taciturn and often does not say a word during meals. But his character is gentle and polite, and his subordinates all have a good impression of him. I also feel that he is very kind. When he first arrived at the headquarters of General Gort, commander of the British Expeditionary Force, he saw me wearing a lieutenant's uniform and asked, "What? Are you still a lieutenant at this age?"

"General, I have been a lieutenant since the end of the last European War until now."

He laughed loudly and said, "Haven't you been promoted in twenty years! It's too long. I'm going to promote you to captain."

The second time he came, I was still a lieutenant. He was very surprised.

He asked Colonel Pettybone, "What? Didn't I already tell you to call the Ministry of War and say that Mr. Mollet should be promoted to captain?"

The colonel replied, "General, I have followed your orders, but there are many obstacles ahead. According to the regulations, you must undergo two training periods to be eligible for promotion, but Mr. Mollet has only undergone one training period."

When Gamelin heard this, he turned to General Gort and said, "It can be seen that there are difficulties in everything. But I think it shouldn't be too much trouble for a commander-in-chief to promote a lieutenant to captain!"

After I was promoted, Gamelin wrote me a short note with earnest words, saying, "You have finally been promoted! But I dare not congratulate you on being promoted so late." He also asked me to meet him at the Weissembourg headquarters. I still remember the dinner in the fort's cellar that day. In addition to me, those present were General Nogues, Gamelin's confidant who commanded the troops stationed in North Africa, and Paul-Boncour, the French ambassador to Yugoslavia.

All that was discussed was serious business. General Nogues spoke about the needs of his troops, and Paul-Boncour spoke about Yugoslavia's contract to purchase military equipment from France, which had not been fulfilled. Gamelin's answers were clear and concise. He also asked me how the British 51st Division, which was heading to the Saar, was doing. Later, he talked about the French Academy and the dictionaries it compiled, and he said to me, "We now need to come up with a nickname for the soldiers participating in the war. In 1914, French soldiers were called 'Bearded Soldiers' because they had been in the trenches for a long time and had full beards, but in 1940, French soldiers still don't have a 'nickname'."

Paul-Boncour asked him when the German army would attack.

He said, "Yes. Everything indicates that they are about to attack. French aviators and spies have already seen all kinds of German preparations for the attack, such as the concentration of artillery, the stockpiling of military supplies, and the evacuation of civilians, etc." (To be continued) Written by Captain Mollet, the original author of this article

### The Two Concession Authorities and All Sectors Should Cooperatively Stabilize Rice Prices, With Estimated Rice Reserves of Two Million Bags Citywide; Legitimate Business Operations of Rice Merchants Should Be Protected; Mr. Yu Qiaqing Reports on His Rice Purchases Since April

Since the authorities here deemed there to be manipulation and speculative hoarding of rice, having issued a proclamation that such behavior would not be protected, and having repeatedly implemented price controls, the rice prices have only risen higher with each restriction. Merchants and citizens alike are burdened by their livelihood, wearing worried expressions, and society is uneasy. All parties have calmly researched, patiently advised, and attempted to salvage the perilous situation. The two concession authorities have also repeatedly resolved to find ways to stabilize prices. However, with the new grain just entering the market, and foreign exchange rates extremely stable, the rice market has recently experienced drastic changes. This reporter from the "Pingming" (Common People) Society yesterday specifically visited a certain expert in the local business community, who believes this is a temporary phenomenon and expresses his views as follows:

Wealthy Households Compete to Purchase, Creating High Prices

Recently, Shanghai's rice prices have been dominated by foreign rice, and foreign rice prices are converted according to exchange rates. Currently, as domestic rice is entering the market and foreign exchange rates are extremely stable, there should be no reason for foreign rice prices to rise. Even though the situation in Saigon (source of rice) is tense, supplies have not been cut off. The main reason for the price increase is that speculators are taking advantage of the situation, deliberately spreading news of insufficient food supplies, causing the public to rush to hoard. Shanghai's population is said to be four million. If wealthy households account for one percent, and each person hoards ten bags, the total reaches 400,000 bags. If the market suddenly faces such a large demand, how can market prices not rise? The expert then cited a newspaper article by a certain person, claiming that the city's rice reserves were only several hundred thousand bags, which is incorrect. This inadvertently promotes the increase in rice prices. According to reliable estimates, rice reserves in individual households in the city are at least two million bags or more. The so-called reserve of several hundred thousand bags refers only to the amount stored in warehouses. The main source of foreign rice is Vietnam, and shipments have not been interrupted. Although Vietnam is a production area, market prices are determined by production and sales. Since the founding of our nation, foreign rice imports have never been as high as they are now, which also marks a new era in Vietnamese rice exports. Promoting hoarding at this time will only make Vietnamese rice more expensive, harming oneself and others, which is extremely inconsistent with economic principles. The expert specifically emphasized that the current grain price increase completely exceeds the Vietnamese production price, and that individual households, unaware of the truth, blindly follow the trend of hoarding rice, which is the most unwise action.

Group Rice Purchases Should Be Handled with Caution

The expert continued to discuss that while the intention behind Shanghai's various sectors promoting group rice purchases is acceptable, the following should be noted: (1) Group rice purchases may create the appearance of promoting hoarding. (2) Group rice purchases should be directly ordered from Saigon, not purchased in Shanghai, to avoid being exploited by local hoarders. (3) Group rice purchases should avoid business conflicts with merchants, as rice merchants are not all "rice weevils." In fact, they are the main figures in facilitating food supplies. If their livelihoods are cut off, no one will be available for transportation, which may affect supplies. As for balancing current rice prices, the expert believes that the best way is to implement public sales of food. In Shanghai, the first step is to explain the reasons for the current rice price increase. Food is not lacking, but if everyone rushes to hoard, it may incite a panic. Some people are now promoting the purchase of rice to store 100,000 shi (unit of volume), as a reserve for future use, so that there will always be 200,000 shi of rice in the market. The intention is very good, but the quantity is not large enough. The supply and sales of rice are the same as the supply and sales of ordinary commodities. The main method is to facilitate supplies, not to hoard. It is hoped that legitimate rice merchants will order continuously, so that supply and demand will be normal, which is the only way to prevent monopolies.

Foreign Newspapers Report Black Market Transactions

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury," Vietnamese rice has arrived in Shanghai, and large quantities have reportedly been purchased from Rangoon. Foreign rice prices have fallen slightly. After the Shanghai Rice and Bean Trade Association recently set a maximum price for foreign rice, it is rumored that black market transactions are occurring at prices higher than the limit. The Public Works Department (工部局) is investigating this. However, according to a spokesman for the PWD, the maximum rice price limit has restrained those who illegally profit from price gouging. Very few rice merchants are selling rice above the limit. Although the Japanese are still prohibiting the shipment of domestic rice, the rice situation here is still satisfactory.

Yu Qiaqing's Letter to the PWD

Mr. Yu Qiaqing's letter to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession yesterday stated: "Recently, domestic rice prices have reached 100 yuan per shi, and foreign rice prices have reached 80 yuan per shi, with a continued upward trend. The reason is that rumors in the market claim that Saigon has been closed and cannot export, and that rice stored in warehouses in Hongkou cannot be transported into the central district of the concessions. These rumors create opportunities for speculative price increases, which is truly heartbreaking. However, in reality, Saigon shipments for orders placed before November 26 can continue to be loaded and exported. The banned rice is No. 1 old rice, and new rice can still be ordered after November 25, which is not enough to affect the overall situation. However, transportation is somewhat difficult, as British and Norwegian ships are ordered not to sail to Annam (Vietnam). Ship space is gradually decreasing due to the European war, and freight rates are inevitably rising, from 6 US dollars to 10 US dollars per ton, and no ships can be found for the time being.

Selling Foreign Rice at Cost

Furthermore, due to the current situation, war risk insurance premiums have increased from 25 yuan to 50 yuan per thousand yuan. Calculated in this way, the cost of each bag of Saigon rice has increased by about 10 yuan. Seeing this situation, I sold 36,000 bags of rice from my previous shipments on the "Haida" and "Dade" ships at a low price of 74.56 yuan per bag of 220 pounds, with a cost of 80 yuan per bag of 320 pounds. A list of the households sold to is attached for reference. This is well known among rice industry insiders, but outsiders who are not aware of the situation have many misunderstandings, which is deeply disappointing. I have been in the shipping business for a long time and have close ties with shipping companies, so I was able to negotiate a reduction in freight costs. For example, the freight cost of 6 US dollars per ton was reduced to 4.5 US dollars, so the cost of 83 yuan per bag of rice could be reduced to about 80 yuan. I then sold it at a low price of 74 to 76 yuan per bag to maintain market conditions, incurring losses rather than profiting, which is truly unfair. I have been doing business in Shanghai for nearly 60 years and have been unfairly praised by society. My conscience is clear, but I still cannot dispel the doubts of the public. Ordinary rice merchants who seek profit would never dare to take on such a huge risk.

Proposing Rice Purchases for Storage

However, no one is continuing to order, and reserves are dwindling. If this continues, the crisis will worsen day by day, leading to an unbearable situation. Your bureau bears the heavy responsibility of local municipal administration. As a director of the board, I feel concerned and dare not remain silent. I propose that the Public Works Departments of the French and International Concessions immediately convene representatives from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the banking and money industries, the rice industry, and the yarn factories to jointly discuss raising funds to purchase 200,000 bags of Saigon rice as a foundation. Some would be sold from time to time, and some would be replenished to maintain a continuous flow. With this storage, panic can be prevented and the market stabilized, which would not only benefit various industries but also greatly benefit the municipal administration of the concessions. Furthermore, regarding my handling of foreign rice purchases since April, a separate report has been prepared for your consideration. There are many rumors outside that I am hoarding large quantities of rice. Fortunately, all foreign rice imports are stored in warehouses, so it is easy to investigate whether there is any hoarding. I request that your bureau immediately send personnel to thoroughly investigate the warehouses, announce the facts, clarify the truth, and dispel doubts. I sincerely hope for your consideration. This is addressed to the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Public Concession."

### Assassination in Suzhou

According to a report from Suzhou via a traveler arriving in Shanghai yesterday, an assassination occurred in a busy area of Suzhou on the morning of the 4th. The target was Peng Zijia, a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, aged 64. Peng was leaving his residence on Shiquan Street in the city when he was suddenly shot. Peng, caught off guard, was shot twice in the chest and other areas, immediately falling into a pool of blood and dying. The city was immediately placed under martial law, but the shooter escaped without a trace.

### Japanese Izumo Warship Returns to Shanghai

The flagship of the Japanese Third Fleet, the Izumo, left Shanghai on the afternoon of the 26th of last month for Ningbo, stayed in Ningbo for a week, and sailed downriver the day before yesterday, returning to Shanghai at 2 pm yesterday. It is still docked at the China Merchants Bureau wharf in Hongkou.

### Relaxation of the West Shanghai Blockade; New Developments in the Area; Notices Publicly Insulting the British Posted; Japanese Merchant Buses Operating on Two Routes

Yesterday, a British official here told reporters that the posters in West Shanghai denouncing Major Hentot, the British Consul-General's military attache and liaison officer to the Japanese army, had been torn down after British Consul-General George negotiated with the Japanese authorities. The posters were written in English, but with incorrect grammar and incoherent language. The general content seemed to accuse Major Hentot of harboring "malice" and stated that people like Hentot were not allowed to pass through the blockade line. Major Hentot told reporters that he was the liaison officer to the Japanese army sent by the British Consulate-General, so even with such absurd warnings, he would still enter and exit the blocked area as usual. He had never encountered any unpleasant incidents in the blocked area and did not know the reason for the ridiculous posters. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy said that he did not know who posted the posters, and it could not be confirmed whether they were posted by the Japanese army.

Notices Posted on Eight Wooden Boards

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury," the Japanese authorities in West Shanghai today (the 5th) erected eight wooden boards on obstacles in the blocked area, with English notices posted on them, denouncing Major Hentot, the British Consulate's liaison officer to the Japanese army. The contents of the notices were incomprehensible and obviously meaningless, leaving observers greatly puzzled. The notices stated, "Major Hentot, the military attache of the British Consulate, made unfair remarks, such as... At the request of the gas company, are these winding paths set up by the Japanese military police? Anyone with malice like Major Hentot is strictly prohibited from passing. Printed by the Military Police West District Command."

British Consul-General to Lodge a Protest

Major Hentot replied to reporters that he was drafting a report on the posting of the notices, which he would submit to British Consul-General George for handling. He visited the obstacles in the "blocked area" this morning, saw the notices, and reported them to the British Consul-General. Beyond that, Major Hentot declined to say more. It is heard that the British authorities may lodge a protest regarding this matter.

The Blockade Situation Appears to Be Relaxing

At the same time, the blockade situation appears to be relaxing today. Residents of No. 54 Great Western Road (next to Lane 54, where Japanese military policeman Sasaki was assassinated) were allowed to move out this morning. A truck driven by a Chinese chauffeur drove to the house to load furniture. However, the Chinese coolies who went with the truck to help move were not allowed past the obstacle. Japanese officials were unable to determine today when the blockade would be lifted this week but said that it would be lifted once the household search was completed. In addition, food and other necessities are now allowed to be sent into the blocked area, but they are subject to strict inspection.

Traffic Still Cut Off at Night

Yesterday's blockade line remained the same as the day before. However, foreign and Chinese students are free to enter and exit various places. The French Concession police and the Chinese police force posted a joint notice at the entrances of each blockade line, the contents of which are recorded as follows: "Notice: It has been investigated that there are three places where residents of the blocked area can enter and exit the city: the intersection of Great Western Road and Yidingpan Road, the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Yidingpan Road, and Qianjia Lane. However, only silver cars and private cars are allowed to pass through for those taking vehicles. All other vehicles are prohibited from passing. A map is attached to the notice." A printed map was posted below the notice. The reporter from Dazhong News Agency immediately went to the three open locations to inspect. It was seen that there was no congestion and that the inspection was quite strict. Foreigners and Chinese and Western students can pass through everywhere and are not limited to the three listed locations, while vehicles, regardless of Chinese or foreign, are only allowed to pass through in those three places. After 8 pm, all traffic is still cut off.

Long Streets Empty in the Blocked Area

By 4 pm, the so-called "West Shanghai Public Bus" was operating within the two blockade lines at the intersection of Haig Road and Jing'an Temple Road and next to the Paramount Ballroom. Those entering must take this bus and are not allowed to walk through the small gaps. The "public buses" are painted dark green, with the words "Public Can Sit" written on the back. The policemen next to the blockade line are soliciting business. One route runs on Jing'an Temple Road and Great Western Road, and the other route runs on Yuyuan Road. The fare is uniformly 20 cents per person, with the Zhaofeng Garden as the terminus. However, there were few passengers, as people were afraid to enter, fearing other troubles. Therefore, although some people urgently wanted to enter to visit relatives and friends, they all hesitated to proceed. The reporter, in order to see what was happening, also took the "Route 2" bus at the Yuyuan Road blockade line around 5 pm to Yidingpan Road. The reporter saw few pedestrians along the way. The long streets were empty, and the shops were closed. The market on Yidingpan Road was also quieter than usual. The reporter then took "Route 1" back to Jing'an Temple Road. It is heard that Wangjia Lane can also be entered, but there are military police stationed around, and inspections are very strict. Prices within the blockade line are still high. Although residents know that the situation has eased slightly, they are all uneasy about the future.

Japanese Merchant Buses Publicly Carry Passengers

Furthermore, according to foreign sources, West Shanghai, which has been blockaded by the Japanese army for five days, seems to be further away from the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department in the extraterritorial road area of West Shanghai. Yesterday, two Japanese merchant public buses were found on Yuyuan Road and Great Western Road. This directly infringes on the patent rights of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company. At 3:15 pm yesterday, two Japanese merchant public buses, the same type as those operating in Hongkou, began operating between Difeng Road and Zhaofeng Garden. Soon after, two more buses were operating on Great Western Road. At the same time, notices were erected next to each obstacle, stating that Chinese who take these Japanese merchant public buses can avoid various restrictions. Well-informed sources pointed out that the various restrictions set up during the West Shanghai blockade were to prepare for the operation of the Japanese merchant public buses. The source also stated that although there are not many Japanese merchant public buses operating in the extraterritorial road area, their illegality is certain. In other words, even one bus, if it runs on a fixed route and charges passengers, is enough to constitute a violation of the patent rights of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company. A senior official of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company stated that a protest has already been lodged regarding this matter, but it is not yet known...

### Telephone Price Increase to Take Effect Tomorrow

After the PWD approved the telephone company's proposal to increase prices, various local organizations jointly appealed, requesting the concession authorities to carefully consider the matter and that the reasons given by the company for the price increase be reviewed. They also requested that the Chinese directors of the PWD do their utmost to argue for a postponement. However, the authorities did not consider this request, so the price increase will take effect tomorrow.

### New Stamps to Be Printed by Year-End

The new stamps that the Directorate General of Posts has commissioned Hong Kong to print will have denominations of 2 cents, 4 cents, 8 cents, 12 cents, 24 cents, 18 cents, and 36 cents. The layout will not be much different from the previous stamps, but the colors will be different. These new stamps will be printed by the end of this month and can be shipped to Shanghai for sale by New Year's Day next year.

### Price Increase for Airmail Envelopes and Stationery

The Postal Administration announces that due to soaring raw material prices, the selling prices of the airmail envelopes and stationery sold by this Bureau have been revised by the Directorate General of Posts as follows: Airmail stationery sets (one envelope and two sheets of stationery) are 5 cents in national currency, and airmail stationery (Chinese or Western style) is 1.5 cents in national currency per sheet. This will take effect from the 5th.

### Discussion on Demands Made by Chinese Police, Etc. Yesterday; Principles to Be Agreed Upon Before Submitting Recommendations; Final Decision to Be Made by the Board of Directors

Recently, rice prices in the area have soared, and the cost of living has continued to increase. Chinese police and fire department employees of the Public Concession have successively made demands to improve their treatment. The terms of their demands have been submitted to the authorities for review and are awaiting a response. It is learned that the concession authorities held a personnel committee yesterday afternoon at 3 pm specifically to discuss this issue. It is heard that Xi Yushu attended on behalf of the Chinese side and gave a detailed report and discussion on the demands made by the Chinese police. According to a senior official of the PWD, the committee only discussed the issue of improving treatment in principle yesterday. The authorities' decision on this matter will depend on the personnel committee's recommendations being submitted to the board of directors for discussion, as approving the demands of the Chinese police and fire department employees would increase the annual financial expenditure of the bureau by several million yuan, so a comprehensive and thorough study must be conducted.

Specific Measures Still Under Study

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury," regarding the demands made by the Chinese employees of the Public Concession Fire Department and Police Department earlier this week for increased allowances, the PWD made no statement this morning. According to a spokesman for the PWD, the bureau's decision on these demands will depend on the results of the study. It cannot be confirmed whether they will be fully approved.

Better Treatment Avoids Disputes

When asked if the PWD would take measures to prevent the recurrence of Chinese police neglect of duty, the spokesman said that he could not answer that question, but if the salary base of the Chinese police is satisfactory, such a crisis can be expected to be avoided in the future. At the same time, personnel in the fire and police departments are working as usual, awaiting the results of the PWD's study of their demands.

### French Concession Publishes Crime Statistics for November

In the French Concession, criminal cases invariably increase every winter. November of this year was no exception. However, thanks to increased vigilance by the authorities, the number of criminal cases increased was not severe. Whenever the police received timely warnings, they were able to deal with them effectively. The statistics for criminal cases in November are as follows: In no less than four cases, victims reported to the police, confronted the thieves on the spot, and captured them. There was one assassination case: the first case was a Chinese woman who was strangled to death in an inn. The murderer was soon caught and, according to investigation, was a crime of passion. The second case involved a Sikh policeman who was robbed of his pistol and seriously wounded in the leg, dying of his injuries. In addition, one of the two murderers in an assassination case in October has now been arrested. That case was a gang fight, and an accomplice has also been arrested. There were two kidnapping cases: in both cases, the police rescued the victims and arrested the kidnappers. The first case involved two children who were kidnapped by their relatives under the pretext of watching a movie in West Shanghai. Because the police found the kidnappers' lair, the kidnappers were forced to release the victims. Although one of the three kidnappers had a pistol, all were arrested. The second kidnapping case involved a five-year-old child who was kidnapped by a neighboring handyman. It was later discovered that the child was being held in the Public Concession and was rescued, and five kidnappers were arrested. In addition, there were 31 theft cases, two attempted cases, and two cases of residential intrusion. There were also two cases of robbers from the previous month, and seven of the current theft cases have been solved. There are also 19 petty theft cases and 38 vandalism cases. The police also seized four pistols in 10 searches for theft cases, and 17 theft cases were solved in 25 searches.

### Procedures for Travelers to Hong Kong; Hong Kong Civil Affairs Department Has Issued a Notice

Regarding entry procedures for travelers from Shanghai to Hong Kong since the Hong Kong government promulgated the Immigration Restriction Ordinance, the Taikoo and Jardine shipping companies in Shanghai have telegraphed Hong Kong for inquiries. According to a telegram received by the shipping industry, the Hong Kong government's Department of Chinese Civil Affairs has issued a notice stating, "Notice: It has been learned that from December 17 of this year, no person of any nationality will be allowed to return to the Hong Kong territory without any of the following certificates: (1) Valid passport, (2) Residence permit, (3) Entry permit. Anyone wishing to obtain item seven certificates may apply to the Immigration Department for issuance from November 18 of this year, from 9 am to 4 pm. Fees must be paid for obtaining the certificate. Children under the age of 15 do not need to obtain a certificate if their parents hold the above certificate. Anyone leaving Shanghai who intends to return after December 17 of this year should take care to obtain a certificate before leaving Shanghai, otherwise they may encounter difficulties upon their return, many inconveniences, or even be detained in the People's Immigration Inspection Center and sent back to their original location. All persons residing in Hong Kong may obtain certificates for their relatives and friends outside Hong Kong, but they must still submit photos of those relatives and friends when applying. This notice is hereby issued for general information." The establishment of an office of the Hong Kong Immigration Department in Shanghai is still in preparation.

### Two American Ships Fully Loaded With Overseas Chinese to Return to China This Year; Tickets for Both Ships Are Now Fully Booked; More Than Forty Pastors of the Presbyterian Church Will Travel Together

Two American President Lines ships sailing from Shanghai soon will be fully loaded with evacuated American nationals and returning to America. The two ships are the President Cleveland (departing December 10) and the President Coolidge (departing December 31). Tickets are now fully booked. Many passengers have reserved berths since the U.S. government advised Americans in the Far East to retreat. The President Coolidge will sail directly from Japan to Manila and will not call at Japan. The rumor that the ship is carrying aircraft, pilots, and military equipment to strengthen the defenses of the Philippines has not been confirmed today. An official of the President Lines said that he was unaware of the rumor. The above two ships will both call at Kobe after leaving Shanghai and then cross the Pacific to return to the United States. The ships will be fully booked with passengers.

Church Personnel Will Return One After Another

It is learned that among the Americans returning to the United States on the President Coolidge at the end of this year are more than 40 pastors from the Presbyterian Church. All travel expenses are paid from the Church Missions Fund. In addition to these 40 people, 30 pastors from the Presbyterian Church returned to the United States on the Washington on the 20th of last month. The church's current evacuation plan will continue until March 1 of next year, as other churches will then carry out evacuations. When the U.S. State Department advised American nationals in the Far East to evacuate, almost all of the pastors were unwilling to leave their posts and return home. A month later, Bishop Roberts, a special envoy from the American Church General Assembly, was sent to Shanghai to preside over and supervise the evacuation of the pastors, so the church decided to send women and children back to the United States one after another. In addition to the 40 people being evacuated at the end of the month, more than 1,000 Americans from the church will be evacuated in March of next year.

### Large Quantity of Winter Clothing from America to be Shipped to Shanghai on Schedule, To Be Distributed by the American Friends Service Committee

The American Friends Service Committee in Shanghai is composed of church members and is directly affiliated with the New York headquarters. Since its establishment more than a year ago, it has been committed to refugee relief work and has a high reputation. It provides even more benefits to Jewish people who have been displaced and driven from Europe to Shanghai. The committee has set up an office in Hongkou and cares for all Jewish people, providing medical care, distributing medicine, and giving out winter clothing. Their enthusiastic service is commendable. Recently, they received a telegram from the New York headquarters stating that a large quantity of winter clothing in San Francisco could not be shipped to Europe due to transportation difficulties and would be rerouted to Shanghai. It is now learned that the clothing, totaling two large packages, has been loaded onto the President Cleveland and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 9th. It will be handed over to the American Friends Service Committee for distribution to various Jewish refugee camps. If there is a surplus, it will be donated to other relevant organizations for distribution to refugees to help them get through the winter. In addition, the Jewish Relief Committee received a donation of 1,053 yuan from Ms. Hess yesterday, specifically for the use of the Jewish Hospital. This donation was raised at a concert held at the Asiatic Society last Saturday. The total ticket revenue was 1,196.67 yuan, and after deducting all expenses of 145.89 yuan, the remainder was transferred to the Jewish Hospital's fund.

When the ship was refloated, another ship, name unknown, was nearby. A British tug assisting in the rescue has been recalled. All personnel aboard the Greek Merchant are safe. Once the minor damage to the ship is repaired, it will continue its journey.

### Arrest of Native Opium Dealers, Arrest of Taiwanese, Handed Over to Japanese Consulate by Police

Hua Guang News Agency reports: Gao Yong'an, a Chinese detective at the Laozha Police Station, recently received a tip that someone had smuggled a large quantity of opium from a certain place and was hiding it in the concession with the intention of selling it gradually. This person would be transporting the opium past the Qinglian Pavilion on Fuzhou Road yesterday morning. Detective Gao reported this to the Western detective chief and went to wait at the appointed time yesterday morning. They arrested a Shandong man named Zhang and seized a large bag of opium from him. They took him to the Laozha Police Station. Under interrogation, the man confessed that he was entrusted to deliver the opium to a certain place. He then led Chinese and Western detectives to Room 337 of the Central Hotel on Hubei Road to arrest the main suspect. When the detectives arrived at the room, three men claiming to be Japanese ruffians came out and interfered, admitting that the opium belonged to them and that the detectives had no right to arrest them. They even resisted arrest. The detectives telegraphed the police station, and a large number of additional detectives arrived and detained the three men.

### Japanese Soldiers and Bandits Fight on Former Yidingpan Road, Japanese Military Police Search Residences and Discover Bandit Lair, Gunfire Exchange Rescues Kidnapped Victim Tang Hesheng

The *Ta Lu Pao* reports that just after 4 AM yesterday (the 4th), a Japanese military police search team exchanged gunfire with a group of bandits near Yidingpan Road and Yuyuan Road in the Shanghai sealed area. The gunfire erupted for a time. According to the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department,

Both Sides Exchanged Fire

As a result, Tang Hesheng, a opium merchant kidnapped on Haig Road on November 28, was rescued. He was taken to the Japanese military police headquarters at 94 Jessfield Road and was subsequently allowed to return home. It is reported that two bandits were injured during the shootout. Whether any other bandits were arrested or any Japanese military police were injured is unknown to the police department. According to detectives at the Jing'an Temple Police Station, the shooting took place in a house next to Yidingpan Road. The area is entirely outside the Public

Concession

Therefore, the police department did not receive an official report about the incident. When the Japanese soldiers and bandits exchanged fire, nearby residents were startled by the sudden gunfire and were greatly frightened. After the news spread, rumors of another assassination circulated in the city. Tang Hesheng was kidnapped at 7:55 AM on November 28 while having tea at a teahouse at 65 Haig Road. The police believed that the bandits aimed to

Extort Ransom

Because Tang was quite wealthy. Until yesterday, a team of Japanese military police searched a house next to Yidingpan Road and discovered it was the bandits' lair. It is said that the bandits fired first, and the Japanese military police returned fire, injuring two bandits and rescuing Tang Hesheng.

Robbery Summary

The Fukang Food Company at 11 Lujia Lane, Lujiawan, French Concession, is owned by Zhang Fukang from Danyang and has been doing well. At approximately 7:45 PM last night, five robbers suddenly arrived. Two were armed with handguns, and three robbers went inside, straight to the accounting room upstairs, while the other two robbers kept watch at the door. They snatched more than 300 yuan in cash from the cash box and robbed the gold ring and watch worn by the owner, Zhang Fukang. Coincidentally, Zhang's niece returned from outside and was secretly told by an old employee that robbers were looting. She immediately retreated and secretly reported to a nearby Vietnamese policeman. Upon hearing the news, the policeman rushed over, but the two robbers on guard had already taken the opportunity to escape. When the Vietnamese policeman went upstairs, he encountered an armed robber carrying the stolen goods downstairs. They met on the stairs. The policeman thought he was an employee of the store and allowed him to pass. The two unarmed robbers upstairs were captured by the employees and taken to the police station by the Vietnamese policeman for investigation.

At 11:40 AM yesterday, a pedestrian carrying a bag passed the intersection of Hubei Road and Fuzhou Road in the Public Concession.

Educational News

### Director Xu of the Education Department Summarizes Zhejiang Province's Education Over the Past Year (Part 1) - Based on Reports from Various Counties and Inspections by Superintendents - Differentiating Items That Should Be Improved and Points to Note

(Lishui Correspondence) Zhejiang Provincial Education Director Xu Shaodi, based on the educational work reports submitted by each county and the regular guidance reports from the superintendents of this department, has summarized the points to be improved or noted in the educational administration of each county, as follows:

I. Regarding the Organization and Administration of the Education Department:

(1) Whether the county education administrative organization is sound is of great importance to the efficiency of educational administration. If the service personnel of the county education department are not qualified, or the number of personnel is insufficient to cope with the work, or the work is not properly distributed, it will cause significant obstacles during the process. Regarding the number of internal personnel in the education department of each county, (1) the phenomenon of having too few personnel and being unable to cope with the work is common in various counties. Only Yin County and Rui'an County have more than ten people. Only Fenghua, Qu County, Yongjia, Ci County, Dongyang, Yongkang, Jiangshan, Pingyang, and Zhenhai counties have between nine and seven people. The remaining counties, including Xinchang, Huangyan, Tangxi, Longyou, Jiande, Chun'an, Yuhuan, Qing'tian, Longquan, and Xuanping, and the fifteen counties of Sheng County, Ninghai, Wenling, Tiantai, Xianju, Wuyi, Pujiang, Kaihua, Suichang, Suian, Yueqing, Jinyun, Songyang, Yunhe, and Jingning, only have five or four people. The fewest is Dinghai, with only two people. (The above statistics are based on the 43 counties that have submitted reports, excluding Jinhua and Lishui counties, which do not have accurate figures.) According to reports from various counties, the education department often feels that there is not enough manpower, and there are also personnel listed in the education department who are primarily engaged in work that does not belong to the education department. In the future, attention should be paid to (1) the number of personnel should be based on the needs of business development and the number of affiliated institutions, (2) personnel should be full-time, (3) there must be an appropriate distribution of internal work.

(2) In terms of supervision, the relevant department in each county is extremely isolated from the situation of each affiliated school due to the small number of supervisors or insufficient supervision. Each county should have a visit once or twice per semester to ensure that the service personnel of each education institution can work diligently. In the past, due to insufficient supervision, there were cases where schools had been closed for a long time, but the county government was still unaware and continued to issue funds as usual. According to the inspection reports, in addition to the counties under the guerrilla area, Cixi, Dinghai, Xiangshan, Yuyao, Shangyu, Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Kou County, Xinchang, Ran, Huangyan, Ninghai, Wenling, Tiantai, Xianju, Jinhua, Lanxi, Dongyang, Yiwu, Yongkang, Wu□, Pujiang, Tangxi, Qu County, Longyou, Jiangshan, Changshan, Kaihua, Suichang, Chun'an, Shouchang, Yongjia, Yueqing, Pingyang, Taishun, Jinyun, Songyang, Longquan, Qingyuan, Yi□, and Jingning, a total of forty-two counties, did not submit reports. Examination forms for supervisory personnel were also not submitted by thirty-eight counties to the department. Therefore, it is difficult to understand the actual situation in each county. In the future, when implementing national education, supervision must be strictly enforced. It is hoped that everyone will pay attention to (1) the establishment of supervisory personnel should be directly proportional to the number of affiliated institutions, (2) stipulate the number of visits per semester, (3) supervision reports should be submitted within one month after the end of the semester, (4) examinations for supervisory personnel must be fair.

### Rewarding Teachers and Staff in the City's Primary and Secondary Schools

Those with more than ten years of service will be compiled and submitted for awards - Applications for free schooling for children attending primary and secondary schools

(Dahua News Agency) In view of the hard work and low income of teachers and staff in the city's primary and secondary schools, the educational sector is deeply concerned. Since the fall of Shanghai, they have struggled arduously and have been able to continue the lifeline of education without interruption, which is commendable. In order to comfort these long-serving teachers and staff and to reduce the burden of their children's education expenses, in addition to submitting a request to the Ministry of Education for commendation, they are also formulating a method for free schooling for the children of teachers and staff in primary and secondary schools, referring to the methods promulgated by the Ministry. All current teachers and staff in public and private registered primary and secondary schools who have continuously served in one school for more than ten years can have their principals provide detailed resumes for compilation and submission for awards. After review and approval by the relevant authorities, they will be forwarded to the Ministry of Education for approval. Children of primary and secondary school teachers who are studying in public primary and secondary schools in this city can also have their principals compile and submit requests for free schooling, which can be implemented after review and approval, it is said.

### Guizhou Provincial Government Restores Middle School Student Loans

(Guilin Correspondence) The Guizhou Provincial Government has issued a general order to all county governments to restore the loan system for middle school students in each county. The total amount of loans should not exceed 9% of the county's annual education budget. This should be allocated from within the county's overall budget estimates for the 30th year of the Republic, and properly distributed to maximize relief efforts.

### School News

Dacheng Vocational Tutoring School, known for its low tuition and emphasis on discipline, originally located on Hartung Road, has moved to 310 Sima Road, New Middle School, starting today. Its central location attracts many students who wish to apply for admission.

To commemorate its anniversary, Zhaohe Elementary School held group exercises by various grades starting at 9:00 AM on the 5th. In the afternoon, a parents' meeting and a student achievement exhibition were held. The aged Huang Zhong, known for his archery skills, seemed less impressive. Xu Jingcheng, the "Left Foot King" from Shanghai, suddenly fell ill with a fever of 38 degrees Celsius and was unable to participate. Feng Jingxiang's father was absent at the last minute. As a result, Xu Wenkui and Wu Qixiang from Shanghai were used, with impressive head and foot skills. The entire process was quite thrilling. Hou Chengtuo's kick finally secured the victory, seven minutes after the change of sides.

Random Thoughts

### The Xu Family's Happy Event

— Gourmand

It's been a long time since I attended a wedding feast. Firstly, because no one invited me, and secondly, because times are tough. When casual acquaintances have happy occasions, it's best to avoid them. Evading a debt is better than relying on goodwill, so I just pretend not to know. This time, Old Xu is a familiar old neighbor, and he personally invited me, so it seems I have no choice but to give a gift and attend the wedding!

Since I'm giving a gift, I won't do things at a loss. That day, I wore what I thought was a very nice silk robe, new leather shoes, and carefully combed my hair. These were just for show, but my primary purpose was to eat and see. Unlike the women, who treat this kind of dressing up as a huge deal.

When I arrived, the greeter welcomed me inside. After offering my congratulations and accepting tea and cigarettes, my task was done. I sat down comfortably.

The surroundings were filled with harsh voices, drum sounds, and the sound of the erhu. The most eye-catching thing was the huge, bright "囍" (double happiness) character made of neon lights. The congratulatory banners on the walls were inlaid with dazzling gold letters, such as "Made in Heaven," "Talented Couple, Beautiful Flowers, and Full Moon," "Perfect Match!" Seeing these, I couldn't help but think of the meaning of the word "happiness," and my whole body felt melted by the feeling of "happiness." I even forgot about my long-standing regret of not getting a gift certificate. If someone came here and still wore a deadpan expression, it would be completely out of place and impolite. So everyone, without exception, had a big smile on their face. Whether male or female, old or young, being friendly and amiable was never wrong, and this was the most free and equal thing.

The stage performances didn't seem to attract much attention. Only the children were closely surrounding the stage, and some idle passersby were standing and watching the free show. The actors on stage also seemed absent-minded. They were performing mechanically, clearly just going through the motions. They were struggling in a series of endless performances, unable to escape the oppression of their lives. Perhaps they didn't feel any joy or happiness here.

The guests were discussing:

"What's wrong? Why isn't the bride here yet?"

"I heard she went to take photos!"

"It's not taking photos, the bride isn't ready yet!"

"This time I heard the bride is very young, only eighteen years old, but the groom is already almost forty!"

"Hmm! Women really should get married at this time! If they wait too long, no one will want them."

"What kind of talk is that? Does a woman have to rely on marriage to live a good life? Women are also people, and women are no worse than men. Why do women now look down on themselves? As if they were born to be men's accessories! Humph, I don't think so!"

"Look! Isn't that the bride coming?" The debate was interrupted by a sudden shout, and everyone quickly looked outside. Sure enough, a bride in a bright red dress was being pushed in by a crowd of people, with the music playing enthusiastically. People immediately became restless, and children were darting around in the crowd.

"Ah, it's the bride from the Zhao family upstairs!" Everyone was disappointed, but the real joy came soon after.

The hall suddenly became noisy again. This time, the greeter ran in to report, and at the same time, we received a lot of paper flowers and streamers. The stage performers were pushed aside, and everyone craned their necks to look around. The crowd was split into two sections, and some people were standing very tall. The wedding march sounded for the second time, and the noise was drowned out by solemnity.

The groom and best man led the way, followed by the bridesmaid and the bride, walking with unbearably slow steps. "Okay, this is a decision for life," he thought, and she thought the same.

The groom and bride stood still, and several people wrapped colored paper streamers around their necks, tightly wrapping them again and again. Everyone's faces were full of smiles, and the young men and women became even more excited. Their minds were playing tricks on them, and they looked at each other passionately. The girls blushed and lowered their heads, feeling embarrassed.

For the seating arrangement, because I wanted to eat comfortably, I deliberately chose a seat next to a fellow who looked younger than me. I had planned in advance which piece of meat or fish I should pick, and how I should choose the dishes to appear generous and be able to eat a large amount of good food. Everyone sat down, first said "Please," and then the chopsticks went down. At first, there was still some politeness, but later the situation became a bit wrong, it was clearly a scramble. If you were slow, you simply wouldn't get anything to eat. The child next to me unexpectedly turned out to be a fierce eater. He was small, but he ate more fiercely than anyone else. I watched him eat horizontally and vertically, without taking a break. At this point, I realized that the younger generation is truly to be feared.

There was a large, fatty piece of chicken left in the plate. One person reached out with his chopsticks and was just about to grab the chicken when another pair of chopsticks attacked from the side at the same time. The first person embarrassedly withdrew his hand, and the second person also felt a bit awkward, so he reluctantly picked something else. The child next to me seized the opportunity and put the chicken in his mouth. The first person glared at him, but etiquette is just like that!

The female guests stood and waited for us to finish eating. I knew that they were also starving. Some male guests joked with them:

"Do you want to grab a bun to stave off hunger?"

"Bah! We're not hungry ghosts reincarnated, unlike you who haven't eaten in your past life!" The women's mouths were very tough, and everyone laughed again.

In the midst of the seating, a drunkard, made dizzy by the wine, pointed at the female performer singing Shenqu on the stage and said, crying:

"XXX has lost her charm since she got married?"

"Lost her charm? Her man still relies on her fame to make money. Look, she's making forty old dollars for these two hours today!"

A person dressed as an old woman on the stage raised her voice particularly high this time:

"Ah ya? You little girls, it's not easy to be a good wife. Look at so many, you choose well! She pointed her finger at the guests. Everyone felt a tickle in their hearts, and smiles appeared on their faces. Then they heard the girl sing:

"They don't want me!" She blushed and deliberately glanced at everyone.

"I want you! I want you!…" The audience shouted in unison. Everyone wants a bargain, and the pent-up sexual hunger was released at this time.

I headed home with a drunken and happy heart. The night was cold and windy, and everything returned to silence.

### "Unexpected" and "Expected"

— Zuo Zhuan

The fox praised the crow's singing as beautiful. The crow opened its mouth, and the piece of meat it was holding fell into the fox's mouth. This was certainly somewhat "unexpected." However, the "sadness" that follows "extreme joy" is something that is "expected." Originally, things should not be done to excess. A ball that is pressed down tightly will "bounce up" again. If you lead your enemy to a dangerous cliff, is it possible that he won't turn around and fight you?

Of course, ambitious fantasies are often sweet. Thinking that after "displaying virtue and power," people will "guarantee" that they can be brought under control, not only pleasing them but also satisfying their "desires." Who would have thought that, "unexpectedly," the "guaranteed" things would suddenly "play a different tune!"

Alas! It truly is "unexpected"!

In fact, a real fool is also a bit "cleverly stupid." Moreover, the cleverness of "telling smart people to play dumb" requires even more "effort"!

Therefore, to sum it up, this unexpected thing was actually "expected" all along!

Alas! It truly is "expected"!

### Foreword

The poem says, "The mirror of Yin is not far off, it is in the Xia Dynasty." History is a truly clear magnifying glass of humanity, and the causes of governance, chaos, prosperity, and decline, as well as the ebb and flow of success and failure, can all be seen within it. Unfortunately, most people are immersed in their environment and neglect themselves, leading to all sorts of repeated mistakes. Thus, viewing the past is like viewing the present, and viewing the present is like viewing the past. The rise and fall of previous dynasties are merely dusty traces, and the changes in the present world only increase the sense of what is to come. As Du Mu said, "Later generations lament them but do not learn from them, which will only cause later generations to lament the later generations." How poignant these two sentences are! When the world was in great chaos and the nation was on the verge of collapse at the end of the Ming Dynasty, in a corner of Jiangnan, people were enjoying the lights of towers and pavilions, the music of pipes and strings, and the stylish scholars and elegant poets, with their carriages and horses, singing and dancing, as if they were deaf and blind to the nation's perilous state and the urgency of foreign aggression. Placing fire on a pile of firewood, they mistakenly believed they were safe, embracing the thought of "let us enjoy ourselves with joy and pass the days in leisure, soon we will die, and others will enter our rooms," seeking immediate pleasures and ignoring future disasters. Even those famous officials and great scholars, who bore the responsibility of governing the country and defending against foreign invaders, and who were supposed to be pillars of the state and shields of the nation, were all indulging in romance, seeking beautiful women, and enjoying themselves in the rivers and lakes in their leisure time. Alas, could this also be the result of the times? It seems that even Heaven knows the situation, and often produces outstanding talent and spirited people from women. One after another, those who fell into the world of entertainment were precisely the most beautiful women with pure hearts, intelligence, passion, and artistry, and were rare treasures of the world. Men were made of mud, and women were made of water. Heroes loved beauty, kings loved beauty, and talented people loved beauty. In general, no one could escape the temptation of beauty, and they were all captivated by the pomegranate skirts. At the same time, many gigolos, actors, and famous performers emerged, vying to please and attract attention, rushing to the scene in droves. As Ban Qiao Miscellaneous Notes said, "Outside the willow shade, in the jade pot, autumn flutes are often played, and spring orioles suddenly sing. Even Song Guangping, with his heart of iron and stone, could not help but write poems about plum blossoms." However, were the hearts of all people in the world completely dead? The most painful were those patriots and people of virtue, women in lacquer rooms, who watched the difficulties of the times with wide eyes and mourned the nation's disasters. In a world where everyone was intoxicated and foreign aggression was rampant, their worries about the nation were of no use, and it was not easy to turn the tide alone. Helplessly, they carried a surge of hot blood and a heart full of ambition, and struggled in a difficult and challenging environment, knowing it was impossible to succeed, but still doing it. They paid no attention to success or failure, gain or loss. Wasn't this earth-shattering and awe-inspiring? On one side, it was like this, and on the other side, it was like that, and they were performing in the heavily fortified suburbs and in the midst of the nation's turmoil. Iron horses, golden swords, green sleeves, and red powder, these are the traces left for later generations, so that those who see them in similar situations, how can they not be saddened by the past and shocked by the present? Truly, "Flowers and plants are empty in the back chamber of the vermilion gate, and the pipa of the green tomb laments the Ming concubine." How could An De get someone like He Fanghui to understand the meaning of the words of the broken-hearted man in Jiangnan? (One)

### About "Sai Jinhua"

— Liang Hao

We saw Ying Yin's "Sai Jinhua" before we saw her "Empress Dowager Cixi," which she starred in after returning from Chongqing. There have been two scripts describing this Sai Ye, who was respected by ten thousand people, namely Zeng Mengpu's "Flower in the Sea of Sin" and Xiong Fuxi's script. It has already been discussed that "Flower in the Sea of Sin" is not a faithful narration. When Sai Jinhua was about to end her life in a humble alley in Beiping, she replied to an interviewer and expressed her disapproval of "Flower in the Sea of Sin." As for the two scripts, Xia Yan's script used the character of Sai Jinhua to satirize the politics and diplomacy of the time. It was no longer applicable after the War of Resistance, so when the Ju Yi Society decided to perform "Sai Jinhua" at the Xuan Palace, it adopted Xiong Fuxi's script. Xiong Fuxi's script started from the story of the wife reopening the banner, until her death, writing about the life of "a generation of beauties." However, "Ye's making amends through diplomacy" would cause misunderstandings among the audience at this time and place. Wei Ruosheng's adaptation, although he added a Shan'er to affirm Sai Jinhua's "behavior," was still very difficult.

Now the United Company's version also adopts Wei Ruosheng's adaptation of Xiong Fuxi's script. Last month, Wei Ruosheng gave this magazine a letter of correction, saying that he never hoped that "Sai Jinhua" would be made into a movie, although many materials were indeed provided by him. I haven't seen the "Sai Jinhua" movie. According to the setting, there are no "foreigners" appearing in the film, which may also be suitable for the "double" environment at this time and place. However, no matter how hard the editors work to adapt it, "Sai Jinhua is just a play about a generation of beauties." Anyway, Ying Yin's acting skills will not disappoint people.

### Shanghai's Cartoon Scene Today

— Zhang Yizhang

Shanghai is the birthplace of Chinese "cartoons." Over the past ten years, many talented people have emerged. Strictly speaking, the history of cartoons in China is only fifteen years. Before this, there were occasional discoveries, but they were not purely "cartoons."

"In 1926, China began to have cartoons, and Shanghai took the lead in this trend. It flourished in 1931. Two years later, cartoon publications sprang up in Shanghai, and the number of painters increased daily. For a time, "cartoonists" were as numerous as carp crossing the river." The above can be regarded as a brief "History of Chinese Cartoons."

Before the war, Shanghai had a "National Cartoon Comrades' Association," which held several "exhibitions" and "dinners." The number of members was said to be over fifty. This number is not the exact number of Chinese "cartoonists."

After the August 13th Incident, "cartoonists" left Shanghai one after another. Those who stayed behind were mostly bound by "career" or "family." However, most of them "concealed their brilliance" and did not publish their works much. (The writer has also not drawn much in recent years, and even if he does write, it is nothing more than "doing it when he is in the mood." He refuses to write for publications that he is not familiar with. This can be a comfort to those who care about me.)

In the past, Shanghai had several painting institutions, but now, due to the scattering of the responsible persons,

### A Record of Ye Shengzhang's Two Plays

— Sha Lei

It seems that there are few "precedents" in Shanghai's pear garden for using a martial arts actor to play the main role. Recently, the Fu Liancheng Society came from Pingnan and performed at the Golden Grand Theater. They made an exception by using the martial arts clown Ye Shengzhang as the main attraction, which unexpectedly resulted in excellent results. This is naturally due to Ye Shengzhang's skills.

I have seen two of Ye Shengzhang's plays, one is "Clever Chain" and the other is "Copper Net Formation." In "Clever Chain," Shengzhang plays Gu Shangzao Shiqian. This play is also named "Shiqian Stealing Chicken." The scenes are simple, so all the tumbling skills can be performed with ease. On the whole, Shengzhang's performance is above standard. He is not only agile, but also stable in his agility. It is also rare to be able to be humorous when joking with the shopkeeper without being vulgar. Finally, when eating chicken, there is also a fire-eating performance. Obviously, this is a trick commonly seen in martial arts troupes, but it is rarely seen in Peking opera.

"Copper Net Formation" is taken from the book "Seven Heroes and Five Righteous Men," and tells the story of Bai Yutang exploring Chongxiao Tower alone, which is a wonderful part of "The Cat for the Prince." The first half is almost a play about Bai Yutang Su Furen playing Deng Che (Gao Shenghong playing). Ye Shengzhang only appears in the second half, playing Fan Jiangshu Jiang Ping. The focus of the whole play is the "fishing for the seal" scene. Shengzhang showed all his skills at this time, as agile as a mouse. The shivering when coming out of the water is well described. What makes it successful is that after hearing the news of Bai Yutang's life or death, he sobbed and said: "If you, brother, take a step first, I, as your elder brother, will be heartbroken!" That kind of sad expression makes people realize the sincerity of friendship, which is truly moving. So Ye Shengzhang is not only skilled, but also understands the "Art of Acting." His ability to take on the main role is naturally not accidental.

### China Travel Agency Re-Stages "The Wilderness," The Story of the Protagonist Lin Na

— Star

After the China Travel Agency finished performing Hou Yuanqing's "Woman" (originally named "Destruction"), they went on to re-stage "The Wilderness." Sun Jinglu was overworked due to her performances in several consecutive plays, so Miss Lin Na took over as the heroine.

On the first day of the performance of "The Wilderness," the reporter went to watch it and felt that Miss Lin Na's superb and skilled acting skills were unexpectedly satisfactory, and she could be compared with Sun Jinglu. Later, in the backstage of the Xuan Palace, I had a brief interview with Miss Lin Na.

No one would have guessed that she speaks such fluent Mandarin. She is a native of Suzhou. When she was four years old, she moved to Qingdao with her family. There, she spent her junior high school years. After the war broke out, she fled to Shanghai and continued her studies at Shanghai Private Middle School. Because of her love for drama, she often performed for fun.

One time, the Shanghai Drama Society asked her to help out and participate in the performance. Her artistic talent was discovered, and the Shanghai Drama Society invited her to be a basic actor. At this time, she gave up her books and officially entered the drama troupe. At that time, she was in the second year of high school, only one year away from graduating from high school.

When "China Travel Agency" was "revived" in Shanghai under the personal leadership of Director Tang, she was once again invited by Director Tang and joined the ranks of "China Travel Agency." Since the first shot in "Resurrection," Lin Na has been meeting the audience under the banner of "China Travel Agency." Over the years, in the backstage of the "Xuan Palace," she has been regarded as a successful actor, along with Tang Ruoqing, Tang Ruoying, and Sun Jinglu, as one of the four major female actors in the "China Travel Agency."

### Hollywood Movie Star News

— Sha Wei

Young star Anne Loosbrock's neck often features a unique necklace made of small car registration plates connected together. The numbers on those plates mostly belong to her beloved friends, so naturally, Miguelona's (her closest boyfriend) is among them.

Hedy Lamarr, abandoned by Gene Markey, has now found two new interests, and her future marital issues may be resolved. The names of these two are director Anatole Litvak and the famous American millionaire Landon.

Although Lola Lane has already found a new love interest, she has recently encountered the danger of being dumped, because the sweet and charming new star Lana Turner has become her love rival, creating some bitterness between the two.

Mona Loane, although a female star with many freckles, still looks so charming and moving. This is really due to the right methods; she most avoids using red rouge and often applies a layer of light green makeup to her face. This harmonious color scheme easily covers up her freckles.

There are many studious stars in Hollywood. Whenever they have free time, they find pleasure in books. People like Mervyn LeRoy, Bebe Daniels, and Marlene Dietrich are all famous number one bookworms.

Several electric bells are installed on the gate of Margaret Lindsay's house. The naughty children nearby often ring the bells and play pranks on her. Lindsay thought about it and could not find a solution. Later, she decided to hire an electrician to remove them. The electrician did not ask clearly and removed all the bells on the gate. One night, Margaret came back from filming and could not find the doorbell, so she had to stand outside the door and shout loudly.

The most beautiful female star in Hollywood is probably the elderly June Collyer. Although she is already sixty years old, she must go to the beauty salon for a few hours every Saturday afternoon. No matter if it is windy or rainy, she must go to ensure her peace of mind.

### A Record of Storyteller Kang Wang

— Lao Shu

Among Yangzhou storytellers, Kang Youhua is famous as the son of Kang Guohua, a master of telling "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," and he truly inherits the family's reputation. Wang Shaotang is popular for telling "Water Margin." Now, these two outstanding talents both perform at the Great China Bookstore, Kang in the daytime and Wang in the evening, evenly dividing the market and each captivating audiences with their storytelling skills. The art of storytelling lies in clear explanations and consistent structure, which should be strictly followed. Interjections are indeed the only embellishment, but they must be placed appropriately. The wording should also be thought-provoking; otherwise, it will feel dull and unpleasant, and inevitably boring. Furthermore, conveying emotions is also an essential element for storytellers. The ability to attract the audience without making them bored is considered a skill. Kang's skill, although comparable to Wang's, allows one to glimpse his ability. Speaking of his strengths: "Water Margin" focuses on social aspects, allowing for more interjections and colloquial word choices; "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" is simpler, and all expressions of emotions should not lean towards pleasing the audience, but must be both refined and popular to be effective. Although both books contain the intention of learning from the past to inspire the present, the difficulty for the storyteller varies. Now, Kang and Wang working together possess the magic of appealing to both refined and popular tastes, which may well add a new page to the Shanghai storytelling scene.
