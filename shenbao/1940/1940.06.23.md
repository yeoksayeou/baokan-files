### Yesterday, Japanese Troops Landed in Fo Xiao, Bao'an, and Advanced on Shenzhen by Land, While Aircraft Scouted and Bombed Villages Everywhere, Aiming to Cut Off Transportation Between Hong Kong and Chongqing

Hong Kong: British military authorities here announced today that Japanese troops are currently occupying certain areas bordering Hong Kong in order to eliminate Chinese guerrillas. The Japanese authorities had notified the British military authorities of this intention, so there is no need to panic. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)

Hong Kong: A batch of Japanese troops landed in Nantou Port, Guangdong Province, this morning and suddenly advanced towards the border between Shenzhen and Hong Kong. According to a statement by a British military spokesperson here, "Recently, Chinese guerrillas have been extremely active, causing considerable anxiety to the Japanese side. The Japanese army will occupy several strongholds adjacent to Hong Kong, intending to eliminate these guerrillas. They had previously notified the British military authorities of this intention, so residents need not be alarmed." (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)

Hong Kong: It is estimated that there are 3,000 Japanese troops who arrived in the vicinity of the Hong Kong border at sunset. It is believed that more are continuing to arrive. At the same time, Japanese aircraft are engaged in reconnaissance throughout the day and from time to time drop bombs on villages to prevent Chinese army resistance, but the Chinese army there has already evacuated. Observers now believe that the Japanese military's actions are intended as a prelude to protesting to the British government for allowing military supplies to pass through the Burma Road to Chongqing. The current situation is similar to that in French Indochina, with an increasing number of refugees crossing the British border. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)

Guangzhou: The Japanese military authorities in South China issued a declaration stating that Hong Kong is still supplying Chongqing with materials. The Japanese army has landed in the area adjacent to the British concession of Kowloon in order to "finally cut off this route." The original text is as follows: "At a time when the European war is raging, Hong Kong is still supplying Chongqing with materials, which is of great significance. The Japanese army has now taken action to finally cut off this route." The declaration also stated that six teams of Japanese troops landed in the Bao'an area adjacent to the British concession of Kowloon at dawn today. It also stated that Japanese troops are currently advancing in the area north of British territory. A statement issued by the British military authorities in Hong Kong stated that Japanese troops are currently occupying several areas bordering Hong Kong in order to eliminate Chinese guerrillas, and that the Japanese military had notified the British military authorities of this intention, so there is no need to panic. According to Hong Kong news, 400 Japanese troops have landed in Nantou and are advancing on Shenzhen by land. At the same time, Shenzhen was bombed by two Japanese aircraft, causing several casualties. Refugees are now beginning to cross the Hong Kong border again. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)

Chongqing: France's concessions to Japan regarding the transportation of supplies through Vietnam have deeply troubled Chinese political circles here. It is said that the Chinese side may negotiate with the French government. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)

Guangzhou: A Japanese spokesperson here recently commented on the alleged transportation of military equipment to Chongqing via Vietnam, stating that the Japanese authorities in South China have recently investigated and learned that 5,000 tons of war equipment and 100 trucks are transported daily from the Vietnamese border to the Chinese mainland via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. If this unfriendly state of international relations continues, we will have no choice but to take appropriate measures to end it. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)

Hong Kong: Some people here today believe that the Japanese military authorities may immediately put pressure on Britain to block the Burma Road to China, preventing the transport of military supplies into the Chinese mainland. These people believe that although France has not allowed the transport of Chinese military supplies via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the Burma Road has not been blocked. The Japanese authorities may demand the closure of the Burma Road. These people also believe that their speculation is becoming more credible due to the actions of the Japanese military headquarters in Guangdong, as the Guangzhou Japanese army has treated France as a belligerent, as if it would disregard any agreements concluded by the Tokyo government. These people believe that Japan may use pressure tactics against Hong Kong, as it did last August. According to unconfirmed rumors here, the Japanese army in Guangzhou may advance towards the Hong Kong border within a few days. (Associated Press dispatch on the 22nd)

Hong Kong: Several Japanese aircraft began bombing Chinese military positions near Bao'an, north of Hong Kong, early this morning. At around 8 a.m., a team of Japanese troops, under the cover of naval and air forces, forcibly landed in Bao'an and then advanced eastward. By noon, the Japanese army had reached Baishi, five kilometers east of Bao'an. When the Japanese army invaded Bao'an, the Chinese army fought valiantly, but was forced to retreat eastward due to being outnumbered. Currently, fierce fighting is taking place near Baishi between the two sides. Another team of Japanese troops landed at Chiwan on the Sino-British border at dawn today and is now advancing eastward. It is reported that Chinese reinforcements have advanced eastward from Danshui, and fierce fighting is expected within the day. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

Hong Kong: According to sources on the Japanese side here, the Japanese army suddenly occupied Bao'an, north of Hong Kong, this morning with the aim of blockading the area to prevent British merchants in Hong Kong from profiting from the fact that the Japanese army is not stationed there. The Japanese army had stationed troops in Bao'an until December of last year, and only withdrew from the area on December 3rd to satisfy the wishes of the British government and implement a partial opening of the Pearl River. However, the British merchants in Hong Kong have been increasingly profiting from the Bao'an area and have recently become more blatant, so the Japanese authorities will not hesitate to use force to intervene when necessary.

Editorial

### Mr. Song Ziwen Goes to the United States

According to a Manila telegram, it has been confirmed that Mr. Song Ziwen of China has flown to the United States. What kind of mission does Mr. Song bear on this trip? Is his activity limited to the economic realm? All parties are silent, and it is not clear to outsiders. However, there are several prominent basic themes that are placed before the world and are recognized by everyone: First, China's three years of resistance have demonstrated the strength of the national spirit, the abundance of potential, the correctness and firmness of policy, and the brightness of the future; as for the resistance itself, its significance has long been understood and sympathized with internationally, and the recent extreme changes in the international situation have further shown that the resistance has made a great contribution to the overall world situation; therefore, China and China's resistance are gaining higher and higher new valuations internationally. Second, among the powerful neutral countries internationally, the United States and the Soviet Union are the most prominent; both the United States and the Soviet Union have great strength, both have the most acute interests in the Pacific, both have clear policies towards the Far East, both have fair positions on the Sino-Japanese War, and both have the warmest feelings for China; recently, the Soviet Union has had to be more vigilant about the European war, while the United States has concretized its Far East policy and is launching various clear and effective measures. Third, although modern international relations have complex and multifaceted aspects, economic factors account for the highest proportion; Mr. Song Ziwen occupies an important position in China's financial and monetary circles, and the highest authorities rely on him deeply, and he has superior reputation and credibility in the United States; from these three points, even without pursuing the true mission of Mr. Song's trip, one can imagine how subtle and important his contribution to the rich and future relationship between China and the United States will be.

The diplomacy between countries is originally woven from various relationships of interest, emotion, and treaties; but there are two other bases, one is strength, and the other is sincerity. Strength is an effective backing for a country to exert its ideas and actions externally. The so-called "weak countries have no diplomacy" should be interpreted in this way. Of course, weak countries can sometimes use diplomacy to improve their position, such as the French representative Talleyrand at the Vienna Conference in the past, and Cavour, the ruler of Italy during the founding of the country, were all good at using diplomacy; but this is only effective for a while, and the increasing international status of France and Italy later was still due to the gradual enrichment of national power. Bismarck was a great diplomat and was also known as the "Iron Chancellor." Iron and blood are the backing of Bismarck's diplomacy. For example, after the First World War, France's diplomatic net can also be considered tightly woven, but now, due to the relative inferiority of its military power, the diplomatic net cannot compensate for the disaster. Another key point of diplomacy is sincerity. A country without sincerity will eventually fail in diplomacy. Japan's diplomacy in the past sixty years can be regarded as extremely active; at first, it used the Anglo-Japanese alliance to defeat Tsarist Russia; then it participated in the European war and reaped the benefits of the fisherman; in recent years, with its feathers slightly plumped, it wanted to make friends with Germany from afar and take the rights and interests of the British and American countries in the Far East. But looking at the fact that before the outbreak of the European war last year, Japan wanted to conclude a military alliance with Germany on the condition of not participating in European affairs, it can be seen that Japan only wanted to use Germany and had absolutely no sincerity. Therefore, at present, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are certainly opposed to Japan, and even Germany can see through the true face of Japanese diplomacy. Japanese diplomacy is thus trapped in isolation.

Holding the above standards to measure Chinese diplomacy, it is clear that the foundation of Chinese diplomacy is solid. Since China launched the war of resistance against Japan, the important direct gains in diplomacy have been: (1) The conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact in August of the 26th year of the Republic of China; (2) Four public loans from Britain and the United States to China, namely, the US loan of 25 million yuan in December of the 27th year of the Republic of China, the British loan of 500,000 pounds, the British loan of 5 million pounds in March of the 28th year, and the new US loan of 20 million yuan in March of this year; (3) Last June, China and the Soviet Union concluded a new commercial treaty, which is a broad and favorable treaty for China. In addition, the various forms of pressure exerted by various countries on Japan are indirect achievements of China. Britain and the United States are three major powers with close ties to the Far East. They are in a position of sharp confrontation with Japan, and exclusively devote their friendship to China. This is certainly due to their complete alignment of interests with China, and the Chinese nation's consistent emphasis on integrity and sincerity is also an important key. Moreover, China has been tempered in the war for a full three years, and its military position is increasingly strengthened, and its strength is increasingly abundant. It is like a core of the Asian continent and a cornerstone of world peace, and its diplomatic situation will naturally be strengthened accordingly. With the exception of Japan, all countries consider it beneficial to join hands with an independent and autonomous China, and there is a need for this in fact. China occupies this important international position, and is also supplemented by its own sincerity and abundant strength. Therefore, the bright future of Chinese diplomacy is known without the need for much explanation. At such an important time and under good conditions, Mr. Song Ziwen went to the United States, which must have great significance and will be recognized by all parties. Recently, US President Roosevelt has been able to use bold tactics in diplomatic policy and has done a lot; Mr. Stimson, a Republican leader who has always been tough against aggression and is particularly familiar with the Far East situation, has also abandoned party boundaries and cooperated closely with the president; therefore, how Mr. Song Ziwen's motive power will be after arriving in the United States is impossible to predict now, but the superiority of the environment surrounding him is truly easy to obtain. Mr. Song is not a skillful diplomat. He is known for his sincerity and honesty. This trip to the United States can obtain precious guests and rich harvests, although it depends on his efforts, but it should not be an accident.

### Japanese Troops in the Suburbs of Yichang Are Encircled and Annihilated by the Chinese, Major Results Are Achieved by the Chinese Army in Western Xiangyang, and the Japanese Suffer Heavy Losses in Fierce Fighting South of Chongyang

In the continuous battles on the west bank of the Xiang River in the Yichang war zone, the Chinese army has been developing smoothly. The current war situation is described as follows: (1) In the Yichang area, the Japanese, trapped in the suburbs of Yichang City, have been strengthening fortifications and rushing to repair the airport in the past two days, attempting to defend the suburbs to the death and resist the Chinese stubbornly. They have now achieved the goal of the Chinese army to attract the Japanese, and the Chinese are gradually destroying them according to their consistent tactics. On the morning of the 21st, the Japanese dispatched more than 6,000 people from Dangyang to reinforce them. They were intercepted by the Chinese army in the Dadongwan Songjiaju area north of Longquanpu, and fierce fighting broke out. The battle lasted until the morning of the 22nd, killing more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese were unable to withstand the attack and fled towards Dangyang. The Chinese also seized 4 Japanese mountain guns and 6 mortars, as well as many light and heavy machine guns and rifles. At this point, the external aid to the Japanese in Yichang has been cut off. (2) In the Dangyang area, the Chinese army has been deploying extremely mobile and flexible forces in the past two days. After suffering serious blows from the Chinese army everywhere, the Japanese army gradually realized that their deployment was wrong. On the 20th, the Japanese used a part of their forces to counterattack Yuxi River (east of Dangyang), which was captured by the Chinese army. The Chinese army intercepted them head-on and attacked the rear of the Japanese army, inflicting heavy losses on them. The Japanese army was greatly frustrated and trapped near the Yuxi River. The Chinese are still intensifying the encirclement and annihilation. At the same time, another Japanese force in Dangyang broke out towards Huangjiaji (northeast of Dangyang). After being intercepted by a certain Chinese unit, they reached the area designated by the Chinese army on the 21st. They were immediately encircled on both wings and fiercely attacked, killing more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers. Few of the remnants took the opportunity to escape and fled south. (3) In the Jingmen-Shashi area, the Chinese army has been developing particularly rapidly, and has achieved great results, completing the task of capturing key points. They are currently deploying to encircle and annihilate the Japanese in the area of Qunji Tupu (south of Jingmen), Machengpu, and Shenjiaji (all southeast of Jingmen). (Dispatch on the 22nd)

A dispatch from a certain place in western Hubei: After the Chinese army completed a strong encirclement outside Yichang, the Xiangsha Road was completely under the control of the Chinese army. Currently, the Japanese troops in Yipangshan and Yangchalu in the suburbs of Yichang are being encircled and annihilated by the Chinese army one by one. A part of more than 1,000 Japanese troops broke out to the east on the 20th. After being intercepted by the Chinese, hundreds of Japanese soldiers were annihilated. A certain Chinese unit attacked the Japanese in the Linjiapei Taihechang area, and the casualties were even greater. The Chinese army around Dangyang gradually compressed the encirclement, and the remnants of the Japanese army were cramped in the suburbs of the city, in an extremely embarrassed state.

The Chinese captured countless ammunition, weapons, and military supplies. (Dispatch on the 22nd)

### Legal Cabinet Studies German Conditions: Armistice Negotiations in Progress; Germany Demands France's Secure Disarmament to Lay Foundation for Lasting Peace in Europe

Bordeaux: News reports indicate that the French Cabinet is currently convening prolonged meetings to consider the German armistice proposals brought back by the French representative from Compiègne. According to a French communique, cabinet members met late into the night, commencing at 1 a.m. under the chairmanship of President Lebrun, to discuss the German armistice terms. The first meeting adjourned at 3 a.m., and cabinet members resumed discussions at 8 a.m. The Cabinet is engaged in extended deliberations but must interrupt proceedings to communicate with French representatives via telephone. The official details of the terms remain strictly confidential. (Reuter's dispatch, 22nd)

Compiègne: Negotiations for the Franco-German armistice agreement began yesterday at 3:30 p.m. near Compiègne. The negotiations are taking place in the same train carriage where Franco-German negotiations occurred in 1918, formerly belonging to General Foch. General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the German Armed Forces, read the preamble of the German conditions in the presence of Führer Hitler. After the preamble was read, Hitler departed, and negotiations began. The chief German representative is General Keitel, and the chief French representative is General Huntziger. The negotiations are conducted entirely in German because Huntziger was born in Alsace, and the other French representatives are also exceptionally fluent in German. After the German terms were presented, the French representatives withdrew to a nearby tent at 4:24 p.m. to deliberate among themselves and report by telephone to the Bordeaux government. At 6:10 p.m., they returned to the dining car to discuss with General Keitel. These discussions are still ongoing. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)

Compiègne: After the French representatives returned from Paris to this location, armistice negotiations resumed at 10:30 this morning and are still ongoing as of noon. The French representatives left here last night at 11 p.m. for Paris and arrived this morning with four secretaries and one female clerk. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)

Compiègne: According to authoritative German sources, the representatives of the Franco-German peace conference are extremely busy today discussing Hitler's armistice terms. Discussions will continue this afternoon, and it is rumored that a communiqué will be issued upon the conclusion of the afternoon discussions. After traveling to Paris last night, the French representatives arrived here this morning. The French representatives first engaged in internal discussions at 10:30 a.m. After an hour of debate, they invited the German representatives to a joint roundtable meeting, which is currently in progress and expected to continue for several more hours. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

Berlin: According to the German News Agency, the French representatives continued armistice negotiations with German General Keitel at Compiègne at 6:10 p.m. yesterday. Although the content of the German terms has not been publicly released, the "Evening News" hinted that Germany will demand France's complete disarmament. The paper stated, "France can only choose between accepting peace and transferring all military equipment to Germany, or watching its military equipment be forcibly seized by the German army." (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

Berlin: The "German General Review" wrote an article yesterday to indicate the demands France should implement within the scope of the armistice. The article vaguely stated that France should bear these demands because its ally Britain has placed it in a dangerous position. The paper continued, "Regarding these demands, France must know that, within the scope of fixed demands, Germany must also consider that it is currently at war with Britain. Therefore, our demand is to prevent France from participating in the war again. This is the necessary meaning of any armistice condition. This may seem to be the only condition that harms France, but in Germany, this condition is a guarantee for continuing the war against Britain and a prerequisite for us to achieve a new peace." (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)

In the Forest of Compiègne: The Situation of Franco-German Negotiations

Compiègne: According to Haitong News Agency correspondent Schroeder, the location where Franco-German armistice negotiations were conducted yesterday is the same site where armistice negotiations were held on November 11, 1918. The ceremony was more solemn than before, but the Germans did not treat the other party with the same humiliation as a complete victor. All roads in the Compiègne Forest were guarded by German troops. In the square, there is a monument with the inscription, "The harassment of Germany was shattered here." The train used for the negotiations is still a regular dining car of the International Sleeping-Car Company. Hitler sat with his back to the monument. To his right were Aviation Minister Göring, Naval Commander Raeder, and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. To his left were General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the German Armed Forces, General Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and Party Representative Hess. Opposite them, in the center, was the chief French representative, General Huntziger, with Vice-Admiral Le Luc to his left, and Ambassador Noël and General Berger to his right. When the French representatives boarded the train, Hitler and his entourage stood up to welcome them. After taking their seats, General Keitel recited the preamble to the armistice agreement. After reciting, Hitler disembarked at 3:42 p.m. and departed. While passing the cemetery for fallen soldiers, the guards shouted, "Führer! The Great German Army salutes the Supreme Commander!" One of the most splendid scenes in modern European history was staged in the Compiègne Forest. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)

Compiègne Souvenirs: Transported to Germany for Safekeeping

Italian-Japanese Commercial Treaty Established

Rome: According to semi-official sources, a commercial agreement adjusting trade between Italy, Japan, and "Manchukuo" has been established. (Reuter's dispatch, 22nd)

Rumors of Italian Conditions: Even More Severe Than Germany's

Bordeaux Port: French newspapers have no reporters in Compiègne and therefore have not released any news. Their argument is that if Germany forces France to accept harsh conditions, it will contradict Germany's own objectives. For example, Le Figaro reported, "Germany cannot fully execute the duties of a gendarme. Therefore, if it wants France to fully accept the future treaty, the conditions must be reasonable." Furthermore, the newspapers generally state that the enemy is breathless and sweating profusely due to excessive effort. For the sake of France, a lenient armistice agreement must be obtained. According to "Le Jour," rumors suggest that the conditions proposed by Italy are even more severe than those of Germany, but informed sources have not confirmed this. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

Milan: According to "Il Popolo d'Italia," the French delegation that accepted the German armistice conditions in Compiègne will travel to Italy to receive Italy's armistice conditions. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)

Agreement Contents to Be Released Soon: Pétain Urges People to Remain Calm

Regarding the armistice negotiations, General Pétain stated that the contents cannot be announced for the time being but may be announced within 48 hours.

Geneva: According to news from Bordeaux, Premier Pétain met with Chamber of Deputies Speaker Herriot and Senate Speaker Jeanneney yesterday to hold consultations. Diplomatic sources claim that the French Senate and Chamber of Deputies convened last night to discuss the German armistice terms. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)

Bordeaux Port: Premier General Pétain met with former Premier Reynaud this morning for discussions. Premier Reynaud had strongly advocated for continuing the war of resistance. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

Geneva: According to the "Journal de Genève," a dispatch from Bordeaux last night stated that the majority of the French Parliament supports the Pétain Cabinet, regardless of its decision regarding peace negotiations with Germany. It was also learned that fifty members of parliament from various parties held a meeting in Bordeaux, chaired by the Mayor of Bordeaux. Former French Premier Laval expressed his opinion that the flight of the French Parliament and government could not save France. After the meeting, Laval led a delegation to meet Premier Pétain, assuring him of Parliament's support for the Pétain Cabinet. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)

A non-military detachment in Andance on the Rhône River repelled a large enemy force with tanks. Italian forces in the Alps launched several local attacks that were unsuccessful. (Reuter's dispatch, 22nd)

London: French nationals here sent a telegram to French President Lebrun, urging the government to "continue fighting shoulder to shoulder with our allies in possible locations with all of France's strength." French expatriates also telegraphed British Prime Minister Churchill, expressing their gratitude for his lenient language regarding France in his speech in the House of Commons and assuring the British government of their deep gratitude and sincere cooperation towards the Allied goals.

### German War Report

Hitler's Headquarters: The German military reported this afternoon that German forces have occupied the important ports of Saint-Malo and Lorient, as well as the town of Châteaudun. In recent days, the number of enemy prisoners captured in this area has exceeded 200,000 and is increasing daily. Countless naval, military, and logistical supplies have been seized in northern France. Notably, the occupation of several enemy aircraft factories has resulted in the capture of over 260 aircraft. German fighter planes and dive bombers are bombing enemy fortresses and troop concentration areas. At the mouth of the Loire River, a merchant ship of 8,000 tons was sunk, a merchant ship of 4,000 tons was heavily damaged, and two motorboats were destroyed. The German Air Force bombed important military targets on the east coast of England and bombed the armaments industrial center of Billingham, with many direct hits. This afternoon, an air battle occurred over Texel Island near the Netherlands, resulting in the downing of six enemy aircraft, with three others fleeing in defeat. British bombers attempted to attack German warships but were shot down by German anti-aircraft fire. German destroyers also shot down seven enemy aircraft. In total, the enemy lost 25 aircraft yesterday, including 11 shot down in combat, six shot down by anti-aircraft fire, six shot down by warships, and the remainder destroyed on the ground by bombing. One German aircraft is missing. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)

### France's Defeat Due to Commanders' Incompetence: Pétain and Weygand's Indecisiveness Causes Pain to Patriots' Hearts; Former British Prime Minister Lloyd George Issues Statement

London: Former British Prime Minister Lloyd George, during a conversation with a United Press reporter, severely criticized French Premier General Pétain, saying that Pétain was so cowardly that he raised the white flag, although the war would certainly not end because of this. Lloyd George continued to attribute France's failure to the right-leaning and indecisive nature of General Pétain and Allied Commander General Weygand. Those in France with self-respect and patriotism will never forget these people who have stolen the nation and insulted the French people. Lloyd George praised President Roosevelt's stance towards totalitarian states, as well as his appointment of Knox as Secretary of the Navy and Stimson as Secretary of War, saying that this was a manifestation of President Roosevelt's true courage and had made a profound and positive impression on Britain. Lloyd George continued to point out that besieged French isolated troops are still fighting in French territory. Given this situation, it is too early to predict that the fall of France will affect all of Europe. This is indeed a strange war. Until yesterday morning, no one dared to say what France would do. Since Premier General Pétain and the French premier and military commander discussed and ordered the French army to stop fighting for several days, French troops everywhere are still shooting at advancing enemies. Although the resistance of some troops is not very strong and has not seriously hindered the German advance southward, most organized French troops are still engaged in heroic resistance everywhere. The French troops in the lower section of the Maginot Line have not yet surrendered, and the brave Alpine troops are preparing to defend the Alps. These troops are the best in the French army. German tanks will find it difficult to climb mountain paths, and they will engage in defensive warfare with bravery. The fleet commander in Toulon has also vowed never to surrender to the enemy. Pétain, who raised the white flag, gained immortal fame for defending Verdun, but in terms of Pétain's military character, he is more cautious than brave. How resolute was General Foch, who saved France from extreme danger in 1918! Premier Pétain has shown no trace of this spirit of perseverance. Regarding the French defeat in December 1918, most of the reason was also due to Pétain's cowardice. At that time, the German attack on Amiens was very fierce. Pétain was unwilling to take risks and ordered his troops to move from the southern line to build strong positions behind Amiens. Later, as the German attack intensified and the lines were about to be broken, Pétain was still hesitant and repeatedly delayed. If the British and French governments had not ordered General Foch to work hard to save the situation, the German army would have cut the Allied forces into two and reached the English Channel. General Weygand is qualified as a staff officer for an expeditionary force but has never commanded troops in battle and lacks the decisiveness of his commander-in-chief. Foch and Weygand together would be a beneficial thing in military terms, but Pétain and Weygand together, since the two men are essentially two of the same nature, neither can compensate for the deficiencies of the other. This war is indeed a tragic end to a war of honor for justice and freedom. Regarding Pétain's surrender, there is also a phenomenon that will permanently affect France's political destiny: the extreme right-wing cabinet's administration before the cessation of war. No leftists participated in this cabinet. Pétain and Weygand are both famous right-wing figures. General Pétain is the one who planned to hand over the Spanish fleet to General Franco during the recent Spanish Civil War and also planned to hand over the gold deposited in French banks by the Spanish Republican government to Franco. The reactionaries in both Britain and France opposed the democratic government of Spain. As for General Weygand, he is also an extreme right-winger. Like Pétain, he has never participated in politics, but he strongly hopes for the fascistization of France. With the establishment of the Pétain-Weygand government, France surrendered to the German army and negotiated a shameful peace agreement. French people with self-respect and patriotism will never forget these facts. On the other hand, the Radical Socialist Party, representing the more moderate elements, unfortunately engaged in Spanish-style and Czech-style diplomacy and could not use their skills to prepare for continuing the war. Although the situation is as it is, the war has not ended. It is too early to talk about the consequences. Today, there is a common feeling among the existing democratic countries: those in power all know that they should awaken from their dreams. The German and Italian peace terms have been delivered to France and are reportedly very harsh. If they are very harsh, Pétain will probably refuse to sign. The United States has now begun a "new" experiment, with opposing parties simultaneously joining the government to deal with the urgent world situation. This is indeed an unprecedented creation and is of great interest here. In the last European war, both Britain and France had governments composed of opposing parties. However, in the United States, it is still a new fact. President Roosevelt's move is truly a demonstration of courage and has made a profound and positive impression on Britain.

### Italy to Concentrate All Efforts on Colonial War in Africa; Encounter Battles Between British and Italian Forces on Eastern African Eritrean Border

Rome: While awaiting the outcome of the peace negotiations between France and Germany in Compiègne, the Italian High Command yesterday concentrated all its efforts on the war in African colonies. With the imminent end of the Axis powers' war against France, Italy will focus entirely on Britain and its African territories. Most observers believe that French territories, such as French Somaliland, Tunisia, and Algeria, may be converted into armed zones within days. Italian aircraft have increased reconnaissance flights over Kenya and Somaliland in recent days. Yesterday's communiqué claimed that British forces attempted to break into Libya but encountered fierce resistance. The communiqué continued that during fierce fighting on Thursday, the British lost ten aircraft and forty armored vehicles. (United Press dispatch, 20th)

Cairo: The Central Military Headquarters here announced last night that mechanized units departing from Sudan attacked enemy forces with great effect. After British forces crossed the Eritrean border, they discovered a large concentration of enemy forces trenching and defending the area, with several heavily defended machine-gun positions. British combat patrols encountered a squad of infantry led by Italian officers. The Italian troops, caught off guard, were heavily struck by the British forces and immediately collapsed, suffering severe losses. The British captured several Italian soldiers and seized many rifles. The British suffered no casualties. The morale of the British troops is extremely high. The British offensive across the Eritrean border is mostly in mountainous and densely forested areas. Sometimes, the British forces attack suddenly, and the indigenous soldiers in the Italian army flee into nearby forests. (Reuter's dispatch, 22nd)

### Italian War Report

Rome: The Italian military headquarters announced that Italian submarines sank three enemy ships in the Mediterranean Sea. Italian aircraft struck a cruiser east of the Balearic Islands and bombed the military ports of Marseille and Bizerte last night. In Bizerte, a cruiser was hit, and fuel depots caught fire. In North Africa, the British military headquarters was also bombed and caught fire. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)

### British Air Force Bombs Italian Industrial Zone

London: The British Air Ministry recently issued a communiqué stating that within 24 hours of Italy's declaration of war, the British Air Force went to Turin and Genoa, Italy, to bomb the Tislocson Sardo aircraft factory, the Fiat and Caproni aircraft factories, and the Seftri-Ponente shipyard with considerable success. During the bombing of the Fiat factory in Turin, the underground explosion caused flames to soar, and the pilots were lost in the smoke for several minutes. Fifteen minutes later, the British aircraft returned, aimed at the southern factory building, and dropped eight heavy bombs. At the same time, the Caproni aircraft factory in Turin and the important road hub north of the city were also heavily bombed. The northern branch of the Tislocson Sardo aircraft factory, located in the port of Genoa, was also hit by many British bombs, causing violent explosions. In addition, the Seftri-Ponente shipyard in Genoa, the Genoa port foundry, and an aircraft fuselage manufacturing factory near Milan were also bombed by British aircraft. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

### British-held Malta Island Airstriked Six Times in One Day

Malta: Enemy aircraft formations bombed Malta six times today at dawn, but no military targets were damaged, and there were no civilian casualties. Several bombs fell into the sea. Although the nearby Gozo and Comino islands are not military targets, they were also bombed by enemy aircraft. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

### British Air Force Activity Over Italian Territories in Africa

Cairo: The British Air Force issued a communiqué last night stating that British aircraft twice attacked the Diredawa railway station and nearby factories in Abyssinia yesterday, with all bombs hitting their targets. Two other airfields were also attacked by the Central Military Headquarters. Italian fighter planes took off to intercept but were ineffective. All British aircraft returned safely. An Italian three-engine large bomber was shot down in British territory in the western desert. All six crew members have been captured. British bombers again attacked Al-Gabi and Al-Adan in Libya last night. The extent of the damage is not yet known. All British aircraft returned safely to their defenses. (Reuter's dispatch, 22nd)

### Air Raid Alert in Cairo, Egypt

Cairo: An air raid alert sounded in Cairo this morning, the first since the war began. Searchlights spotted enemy aircraft, and anti-aircraft guns opened fire. The enemy aircraft did not drop bombs. The alert was lifted three hours later. Four people were injured by fragments from anti-aircraft shells. (Reuter's dispatch, 22nd)

### If the Western Hemisphere is Invaded, the United States Will Resist; President Roosevelt Issues Statement on Addressing Difficulties Faced by Various Nations

New York – President Roosevelt, having been resting for several days at his Hyde Park estate on the Hudson River, will exert every effort to resist any actions invading the Western Hemisphere, whether economic or otherwise. President Roosevelt declared that the United States would actively address the difficult problems encountered by the nations of the Americas. This statement supports the proposal for an economic group of twenty-one American nations, designed to counter the barter system promoted by Hitler. President Roosevelt stated that as the European situation changes, the various measures the United States is taking are only part of an economic defense plan to supplement military defense. These measures are sufficient to safeguard the peace of the Western Hemisphere and are a means of preventing the United States and other American nations from being affected by the international situation. Roosevelt will immediately organize the American bloc and refute the notion that the surplus goods of South American countries, such as Argentine beef, will be dumped in the United States and compete with American goods in the market. He believes that the purpose of this economic bloc is to concentrate the surplus goods of the Western Hemisphere for sale in markets outside the Americas. (International News Service, 22nd)

Washington – Senator Nye stated in the Senate today that he would be surprised if former Secretary of War Woodring and his staff were questioned by the Military Affairs Committee and the proper questioning did not reveal that Woodring had been asked to hand over National Defense Secret Number One. Nye made this statement in response to Republican Senator Vandenberg's request that Woodring be asked to appear before the Senate committee to explain the reasons for his resignation. (Reuters, 21st)

Washington – Due to opposition from Republican isolationists, discussion in the Senate on the new appointments of Stimson and Knox will be delayed for at least a week. Republicans claim that Roosevelt's appointment of Stimson as Secretary of War is tantamount to drawing the United States into the war. Republican Carlson requested that Congress investigate the reasons for Secretary of War Woodring's dismissal. According to Woodring's friends, his resignation was due to his opposition to US aid to the Allies. Woodring said, "I advocate strengthening US defense, but I oppose the US sending troops to Europe. They were very unhappy with me because I opposed sending troops three thousand miles away to fight Hitler. They will eventually force me to resign." Senator Walsh, Chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, also stated that he opposed aiding the Allies and said he would rather resign than see the US drawn into the war. (United Press, 22nd)

Washington – US Assistant Secretary of War Johnson delivered a speech here yesterday, stating that Germany had adjusted its industry and built the most powerful army in Europe. The United States will follow Germany's example and rearm. The United States cannot tolerate military or economic aggression against the Western Hemisphere. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)

Washington – The claim that former Secretary of War Woodring had been asked to hand over National Defense Secret Number One (i.e., the US Army's secret bombing sight) was refuted in the Senate today by Senator Barkley of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It is claimed that he was informed by US Army Chief of Staff Major General Arnold that at no time or under any circumstances was any consideration given to disclosing any secret bombing sight. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Stimson's and Others' Appointments Welcomed by China and Britain

Chongqing – Official sources here recently expressed a warm welcome to President Roosevelt's appointment of Stimson as Secretary of War and Knox as Secretary of the Navy. Officials stated that Stimson, when he was the former US Secretary of State, was one of the most sympathetic friends of China, and that Stimson's actions in opposing Japanese aggression in 1931 were especially appreciated by China. Stimson is also one of the most famous Americans in China, because Stimson's sympathy for China is well known, and his book on American Far Eastern policy has been translated into Chinese and widely circulated. The Yishi Bao newspaper published an article stating that Stimson is a close friend of the Chinese nation. Stimson is the creator of the non-recognition doctrine and advocates British-American cooperation to restrain Japan. Knox's appointment as Secretary of the Navy is also very important. This appointment by the United States is sufficient to show the trend of future US foreign policy. (United Press, 22nd)

London – The Times newspaper today published an article welcoming the new appointments of Stimson and Knox, stating that both are great and talented men. Regarding the dangers faced by the United States in this European war, no different from the Allies, the US government should provide the Allies with all possible assistance as quickly as possible, which is fulfilling its responsibility to its people. It frankly states that the issue of entering the war has not yet arisen. What the Allies immediately need from the United States is not soldiers, but aircraft, ships, tanks, and other munitions. The US government has already provided much of this assistance, and President Roosevelt has especially exhausted his ability to expand and accelerate it. Since the key positions in the War and Navy Departments have been given to members of the opposition party, the obvious difficulties encountered by these current efforts will surely eliminate many doubts. The opposition party has vastly different opinions from President Roosevelt on domestic issues, but also acknowledges that if Germany is victorious, the United States will be in danger. Both men often speak publicly far beyond what they now feel they can do. A few days ago, Stimson, in a speech somewhere, urged Americans to accelerate the transport of munitions to Britain and France with all their might, and if necessary, use American ships or send naval escorts. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Japanese Newspapers Wary of the United States

The Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun stated, "We must prevent the deterioration of US-Japan relations and be prepared for the United States to adopt oppressive measures in its Far Eastern policy." (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)

Tokyo – The leader of the Japanese Minseitō party delivered a speech at the party's general assembly yesterday, calling for the countries of the Far East to unite politically and economically, with Japan taking a leading role. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)

### Romania Confirms German Troop Movements Eastward, to Counter Soviet Troop Concentrations

Romanian Capital – Senior government officials told United Press yesterday that they have confirmed reports that Germany has dispatched large numbers of troops to East Prussia. They said that the purpose of this German troop movement is unclear, but it is widely believed that its purpose is to counter Soviet troop concentrations in Lithuania and Eastern Galicia. It is reported that Soviet troops are still continuing to move into these areas. (United Press, 22nd)

Moscow – Soviet troops, after entering Lithuania, have been warmly welcomed by the military and civilians of Lithuania. According to a letter to Pravda from the famous Lithuanian poet Oveiga, "The life we are enjoying now will forever be one of the brightest nights in Lithuanian history. Songs about this happy life have been written by the Lithuanian people. When the Red Army passes, all Lithuanian people stop work to welcome them on the streets. The Red Army is a true guarantee of peace and friendship between the Soviet and Lithuanian peoples. The Red Army has entered our country to protect the interests of our people; they are indeed protectors."

### Gandhi's Humor: Congratulating France and Germany on Peace

Bombay – Indian National Congress leader Gandhi, due to France's decision to sue for peace, recently sent a congratulatory message to French government officials. (United Press, 22nd)

Bombay – Indian National Congress leader Gandhi recently published an essay in the Harijan newspaper entitled "How to Resist Hitlerism," stating that Hitlerism is a naked and brutal force, which has been transformed into an absolutely correct science and works with scientific precision. What Hitler gives to the Germans is not the joy of possessing an empire, but the burden of supporting its destructive power. The only way to deal with Hitlerism is to resist it nonviolently. The results of this doctrine have confirmed his unwavering belief in nonviolent resistance. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Romania Changes Political System, Ties with Axis Powers Strengthen; Yugoslavia Determined to Maintain Friendship with Germany

Rome – After Romania issued an order uniting all political parties into a single national party, the country has been transformed into a fully fledged totalitarian state. According to the provisions of the order, this national party will guide the spiritual and material life of the nation and the Romanian state. The party's first prerogative will be to transform individual actions into the interests of the state. The comments of the Courantul newspaper can suggest the direction of Romanian policy, saying, "We are following a policy similar to that of the Axis powers, and our ties with the Axis powers are becoming increasingly close." Today, the authorities also issued an order to guarantee the political order of the new party. Anyone who propagates any changes to the national political system will be considered seditious. In addition, it was ordered that civil servants who are not members of the national party cannot hold office, and they must join the party by August 1. (Reuters, 22nd)

Yugoslav Capital – Yugoslav Prime Minister Svetozar Vuković stated to German news representatives yesterday that Yugoslavia's policy is to strive to maintain friendly relations with its neighbors in order to promote the active cooperation of the peoples of Southeastern Europe. Without this, the Danube basin cannot achieve prosperity. This policy is also in line with the sentiments of the Yugoslav people. Therefore, after the outbreak of the European war, the Yugoslav government immediately declared strict neutrality. This frank and honest attitude has greatly contributed to maintaining peace in this region. When Germany and Yugoslavia became neighbors, a spirit of friendly cooperation already existed between the two countries, especially in economic activities. Not only can the economic lives of the two countries benefit from mutual assistance, but Yugoslavia can also serve as a link between industrially underdeveloped Germany and the agricultural countries of the Near East, benefiting both sides. Svetozar Vuković's conclusion emphasized his determination to maintain good neighborly friendship with Germany. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)

### British Prime Minister Churchill Reports on the War Situation (Continued)

Although there may be a risk of paratrooper attacks and soldiers transported by the Air Force attempting to land, we should give them a warm welcome in the air or after they have landed. However, the major issue at present is whether we can defeat Hitler's aerial weapons today. It is regrettable that we do not possess an Air Force that is at least equal to the enemy's, but we already have a very strong Air Force, which, in the many decisive battles experienced so far, has proven to be far superior to the enemy in terms of personnel and many aircraft types. Although we suffered great disadvantages in France and lost many aircraft in land airfields, the ratio of our losses to the enemy's has often been one to two or two and a half. In the Dunkirk battle, we undoubtedly defeated the German Air Force and controlled the local airspace. The ratio of our losses to the enemy's was one to two to four. Anyone who has read the photos published a week ago, seeing that entire groups of troops gathered on the beach could be the best target for enemy bombing, can understand that this evacuation and boarding could not have been carried out unless the enemy had abandoned all hope of restoring air superiority.

In terms of the defense of the island, the benefits of defense will be extremely great. We hope to improve on the loss ratio of one to three to four that was achieved at Dunkirk. In addition, the safe landing of all our wounded aircraft and their crew (a large number of aircraft and their crew do land safely in modern warfare) will be in our own territory, so they can live to fight another day, while all wounded enemy aircraft and their crew, in terms of the war, will be a complete loss.

During the French campaign, we provided the French army with continuous and powerful assistance with fighter planes and bombers, but despite all kinds of pressure, we never exhausted all the strength of our domestic air force fighter planes. This decision was truly painful, but it was also correct, because even if we devoted all our fighter planes, we would not have been able to make a substantial change in the fate of the French war. The failure of the French campaign was due to unfortunate strategic gaps, as well as the extraordinary and unexpected power of the enemy's armored units, and the large number of German troops. If our entire fighter squadron had joined, it would have easily exhausted its strength and become a common occurrence in this war. If so, we would see ourselves in a very dangerous situation now. I can happily tell the House that our fighter plane strength is now stronger compared to the heavily damaged German fighter plane strength than before. Our air force warriors will surely defend their homeland with the honor of resisting the most fierce air raids. We can foresee their great achievements. Enemy bombers will soon wreak havoc on our country, so the danger of enemy aircraft bombing still exists today. The number of enemy planes is indeed greater than ours, but we also have many bombers, which will be used to continuously attack military targets in Germany.

I do not ignore the seriousness of our current test, but I believe that the people of the country will be able to make an effort to overcome the difficulties, at least as much as any other people in the world. How the future unfolds depends on this. Every man and woman in our country will have the opportunity to show the best qualities of their nation and devote their best efforts to serving the country. At this time, all people in the country, regardless of their position, occupation, or responsibility, must remember the famous saying, "Do not leave a despicable act on the ever-memorable curtain."

I think it is appropriate today to briefly tell the House of Commons and the people of the country the reasons why we decided to continue the war. I can assure you that our naval, land, and air force experts all unanimously say that we should continue the war and say that there is a good and reasonable hope of final victory. (Cheers) We have also gained the full trust of the various overseas autonomous territories. (Cheers) The Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa have all sent telegrams to me with extremely sincere words, approving of our decision and declaring their readiness to share weal and woe with us to the end.

We may now ask ourselves, why has our position deteriorated since the start of the war? It has deteriorated because Germany has occupied a large part of the West European coastline and many small countries have been destroyed by the German army. The possibility of air raids has thus increased, and the work of our navy has also increased. However, the power of our long-distance blockade has not weakened as a result, but has strengthened. It is not yet certain whether France will continue to resist, but its resistance will be greatly reduced regardless. If France does stop resisting, then Germany will concentrate its forces on us, but for the reasons I have stated, it is not easy for Germany to do this. If Germany wants to invade England immediately because of the French armistice, then we do not need to station a large army in France, and we can get a larger and more efficient force to meet it.

If Hitler can place the industries of the countries he has conquered under his tyrannical control, then the German production of war equipment will greatly increase as a result. However, this cannot be realized immediately, and we can now get a steady supply of large quantities of arms from the United States, and the autonomous territories and foreign countries have a supply of aircraft and pilots. All of these factors will benefit us before winter comes, while Germany will feel the hardships of winter, because almost all of Europe is groaning under the iron heel of the German army, and the hunger and cold will be detrimental to the German side.

We must not forget that from the time we declared war on September 3, 1939, Germany has always had the possibility of attacking Britain with its air force and other new weapons, which France could not prevent its air raids. Therefore, in these months, we have been in this danger every day, but we have greatly improved our defenses and know that our planes and pilots are better than the enemy's. Therefore, when I consider the danger of air raids with an open mind, I see the reason for extreme caution to prevent air raids, but I do not see any reason for panic or pessimism.

In the four years of the previous Great War, the Allies encountered almost nothing but disasters and disappointments in the first year. Lloyd George can recall this, but the morale of the Allied forces was ultimately higher than that of the German army, which had repeatedly won invasions. In the last war, we often asked ourselves how we could win. No one could answer it effectively at the time, but the terrifying enemy suddenly collapsed unexpectedly before us. (Cheers)

I do not yet know what will happen to France, nor do I know whether France will continue to resist within its own territory and in its overseas territories. We cannot allow the French government to be relieved of its treaty obligations. If the French government does not continue to fight in accordance with its treaty obligations, it will abandon a great opportunity and abandon its future. The House of Commons must have read our willingness to conclude a union of common peoples at the darkest period in French history. Regardless of what France or its government does, we in the British Isles and in the British Empire will never lose our sense of friendship for the French people. If we must now suffer what the French people have suffered, then we should imitate their courage and surpass it. If final victory rewards our labors, then the French people will have something to share in what they have gained and freedom will be restored to all parties.

We will not reduce our righteous demands. The people of the Czech Republic, Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium, who once shared the same ideals with us, will all be restored to their former state. General Weygand's so-called French war has now passed. I expect the British war is about to begin. The survival of Christian civilization depends on this war, and the continuation of Britain's own life and its constitutional empire also depends on this.

All the enemy's ferocity and ability will inevitably soon shift to us. Hitler knows that he must defeat us on this island, or we will fail. If we can cope with it, then all of Europe can be free, and the world's life can be prosperous. But if we fail, then the whole world, including the United States and all that we cherish, will fall into the abyss of a new dark age, and this dark age may be made more cruel and prolonged by the abuse of science. Therefore, we must each do our duty now. We should know that in a thousand years after the British Empire, speakers will still say that today was our best period.

Smith, representing the Labour Party, said that the people of the country supported the Prime Minister unanimously and said that we must persevere to the end. Liberal Party Hailie Selassie spoke, praising Churchill's courageous remarks and great leadership. Lloyd George also spoke, declaring that he had no intention of wasting time looking back on the past, but advocated that in the secret meeting held on Thursday, there should be a very frank discussion of the current situation. Churchill replied that in the debate at the secret meeting, each Member could speak freely, but that national defense should be the focus of the discussion. (Reuters, 19th)

### New Emerging Nation in Central Europe: Romania in the Seam

Speaking of Europe's strategy, the importance of Romania and Southeastern Europe lies in their ability to provide Germany with a passage under the Entente's blockade. The kerosene, wheat, rapeseed, and corn that Germany relies on for war come in large quantities from Romania.

For the people of Southeastern Europe who have a newfound national confidence, the issue is relatively simple. They understand very well that the current few years are enough to determine their way of life and all of their substance. They also know that they are powerless in the face of such major events. All they can do is try to avoid being caught in the crossfire between Germany and the Entente.

Even if Romania's fate does not occupy such an important position, even if Romania's oil and wheat are not strategically important, the situation of this emerging country is worth our attention. Because Romania stands at a crossroads; one direction is a great future, and the other is towards a position of extreme insignificance.

Within Romania's borders, from the Black Sea to Transylvania in the west, from the Carpathian Mountains to the Danube River, there are nearly ten million hardworking farmers. These people live in the most fertile land in the world, comparable to the black earth belt of southern Russia, and beneath this soil, one day, may be found mineral deposits even richer than those already known in Europe. Regardless of the situation of this country today, wartime Europe will naturally pay attention to this fact.

Romania is the world's newest country. The meaning of "new" refers to the stage of its development. Its nation is in the process of unifying its language and customs, its capital is consciously imitating Paris, absorbing its vulgarity but little of its strength, and its ruling methods are outdated rather than modern. What Romania needs more than anything is time, and time is precisely a condition they cannot control.

The outbreak of the war sent Romania into a boundless middle stream. Now, eight months have passed, and the only hope of Romania's rulers is to steer their drifting boat into the safe harbor of neutrality. But the storm of war is blowing harder and harder, and the safe harbor of neutrality is no closer than it was before August. There are already signs of a slight misfortune, as if the boatmen have lost their resolve. The strategies of the nations should take these facts into consideration. Their inevitable path is to oppose Germany by launching another storm of similar force from the opposite direction; if the Entente does so, they understand that they risk sinking this valuable vessel before it reaches port, and sinking its rich cargo before Germany can seize it.

No fact illustrates this situation better than the news of Romania's kerosene production. Through determined negotiations, Germany has secured a treaty to supply Romania with 5,000,000 tons of kerosene annually. This quantity seems impossible to transport in practice unless German engineers spend several years improving transportation in Southeastern Europe; Germany's agents have been extremely successful in acquiring control of several oil concession purchases. These people make Romania aware that Germany needs more than Romania can deliver.

We cannot say for sure; everything depends on the courage and ability of Romania's rulers. At most, we can say that the Romanian army and its officers are better than they were five years ago, but still not as good as they should be. King Carol is doing his best to improve the standards of his officers; in this regard, he needs more time. If Romania's situation reaches the military stage, then only the more powerful participating nations will have the final say. The struggle is limited to diplomatic and commercial aspects.

Romanian territory will have irresistible power, and Romania is striving to move in this direction.

Romania is ruled by a king whose father was of German royalty and whose mother was of Scottish nobility; he possesses several traits from both sides. He is brave, stubborn, thrifty, fierce, loyal to his ambitions, smarter than his subjects, and what represents his personality even more is his reckless spirit. If Romania falls, all hope for Carol and his dynasty will fall with it.

There is a notable similarity in Carol's domestic and foreign policies. Since he returned from Paris by plane ten years ago to take power, he has had to continue plotting and scheming with the politicians he commands, until after 1938, he could consider himself the undisputed ruler of Romania.

For many years, he has been playing this clever policy of power balance, uniting one faction to overthrow another, gradually removing important figures, until he can appoint people to assist him in governance.

In foreign policy, Carol is also playing this game of power balance. If he has had little success in this game, it is because many factors are beyond his control. If no war had broken out, he would have had nothing to fear for his future.

His goal is to include some members of the Iron Guard in the government. Those who say that this gesture is aimed at Germany misunderstand Carol's motives. On the contrary, this is a further action to remove the power of the opposition party. Since the suppression of the Iron Guard, public opinion in Bucharest and elsewhere has secretly expressed fear, because every Romanian has suffered greatly from the constant changes in the political environment and has little hope for the future.

Romania in the spring of 1940 is calm, yet somewhat apprehensive. Most of the army has been mobilized, weapons are flowing in from Germany, Italy, and the Entente, and diplomacy maintains a cunning attitude. With an attitude that what is gained will not be much, and what is lost will not be much, Romania's rulers hope that these reserved attitudes can weather the war. Undoubtedly, they will skillfully utilize these reserved attitudes as long as they can. (Translated from the New York Times)

### National Cultural Academy: School Buildings Fully Completed, Preparations Ready for Autumn Semester

Chairman Chiang advocated the establishment of the "National Cultural Academy," appointing Mr. Zhang Junmai as president, to cultivate talent for the future revival of culture. The Central Authorities have allocated 100,000 national currency units to construct school buildings in Caicun, Dali, Yunnan. Now, all buildings have been completed. The arrangement of other school affairs has been largely completed since preparations began last year. The formal opening of the school will begin in the autumn semester of this year. President Zhang has arrived in Dali from Chongqing to preside over everything. Professors Luo Wengan, Luo Nusheng, Wu Wenzao, and many others have also arrived at the school. There are a total of eight school sites that have been built, with a fairly grand scale. The scenery near Dali is very beautiful, so it is quite suitable for running a school. It is believed that in the future, many schools will move here one after another. It is heard that the houses of the Faculty of Arts and Law of the Southwest Associated University in Kunming have been taken back by the owners and sublet to other agencies for office use. Therefore, there may be a possibility of moving to Dali for the opening of the school. Regarding the student aspect of the Cultural Academy, the results of the recruitment examinations conducted in Chongqing, Kunming, Hong Kong, and other places over a period of three months have resulted in more than one hundred students having already reported to the school. Among them, there are more than ten students from Hong Kong. As for whether or not to hold a second recruitment examination, it has not yet been determined. The school's library has a fairly rich collection due to enthusiastic donations from all parties. The largest batch includes three parts donated by Gu Weijun, Zheng Tianxi, and a German. In addition, the school sent people to Peiping last year to purchase various books that had been lost from previous schools, the number of which is also quite considerable. The professors hired by the academy are mostly well-known scholars in the country. The Department of Classics has Peng Yunsheng, Gao Jinsheng, and Meng Wentong; the Department of History has Gu Jiegang, Hu Ziqing, Wu Qichang, Zhang Guiyong, Weng Dujian, Chen Qingqi, and the German historian Fritslan; the Department of Sociology has Luo Wengan, Luo Nusheng, Huang Yinlai, Pan Guangdan, and Wu Wenzao; the Department of Philosophy has Zhang Junmai, Zhang Dongsun, Shi Youzhong, Xiong Shili, and Xi Yunbo, and many others. All professors will go to the school in Dali during the summer vacation to arrange various teaching courses in advance. In the future, the teaching method of the school will adopt a tutorial system, with each professor leading six or seven students respectively, so that students' academic articles and research can be guided at any time, and their personal and mental cultivation can also be followed.

### German Government and Public Sympathize with China, Unwilling for Japan to Dominate the Far East: German Overseas Chinese with Good Reputation Express Their Opinions, Shanghai Situation Continues to Stabilize

According to a certain German gentleman residing in this city, who has a great reputation, the friendly relations between China and Germany have always been close. Although Germany is involved in Europe, it has never forgotten the evolution of the situation in the Far East, and expresses unlimited admiration for China's spirit of persevering and fighting in the Anti-Japanese War over the past year. Therefore, the German government and public can empathize with China and continuously provide material assistance. The maintenance of the status quo in the Far East depends on the United States. Therefore, despite various difficulties, the US authorities will be able to respond resolutely with great efforts. Moreover, German leader Hitler has repeatedly stated that he has no intention of attacking the United States. Wei Gang believes that Germany is currently capable of breaking the Monroe Doctrine of the United States, but Hitler has denied this, believing that this is a fantasy of Wei Gang. In short, no matter how the European situation evolves, Germany will always sympathize with China's current situation. Therefore, Germany also supports the US Far East policy. Germany does not want Japan to take advantage of the "non-intervention in the European war" policy to promote Japan's aggression in the Far East and dominate East Asia. Therefore, its attitude is very clear.

Demand for Withdrawal of Troops: No Results. According to sources close to the concession authorities, the situation in Shanghai has stabilized, and there is no other incident that could cause misfortune. As for the former puppet mayor Fu Xiao'an's request for the withdrawal of defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai, the British and French authorities have firmly stated that they will not withdraw the defense forces stationed in Shanghai. The British and French consuls have ignored Fu's unreasonable "request." According to yesterday's English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, Italian Consul General Lieutenant Colonel Naroni submitted a reply on the 22nd to Chuan Xiao'an's request to withdraw the British, French, and Italian troops stationed here, saying that this request had been submitted to the Royal Italian Embassy, "undoubtedly, the embassy will convey it to the government in Rome." The humor in his wording can be imagined.

Situation in Western Shanghai: Improving Daily. Yesterday, there were rumors that puppet troops were coming to Shanghai, causing the situation in western Shanghai to become tense again. In order to understand the real situation in western Shanghai, the reporter went to the area of the cross-border roads of Shanghai yesterday afternoon and saw that everything was as usual. Concession police were patrolling back and forth, and there was no tension. Residents were also calm. Although the puppet police who were stationed were still facing each other with guns, there was no tense atmosphere. In addition, there was a small dispute between the puppet police and the French Concession police on the border of the refugee area of the Xujiahui Tushanwan Cathedral, which was quickly resolved. At that time, the situation in that area was slightly tense. The reporter also went to the area yesterday and saw that the Japanese sentries along the Hongqiao Road border had been reduced.

### Italian Ships Sailing on Shanghai-Wenzhou Line: Italian Consulate Orders Suspension of Navigation, Reasons for Refusal to Issue Export Permits Unknown

Since Italy's official participation in the war, Italian merchant ships sailing along the Chinese coast, such as the De Pingchangde on the Shanghai-Ningbo line and the Baoli on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, have continued to operate normally, in accordance with the provisions of international law that no hostile actions may be taken within 300 nautical miles of the coast of a neutral country. However, the Italian Consulate in Shanghai recently ordered the suspension of navigation for Italian ships sailing on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line. As a result, the ships have suspended exports. In addition, the Ender and other four ships of the Sino-Italian Company have been repaired, but the resumption of navigation is uncertain. The details are as follows:

Suspension of Exports

The reporter of Daguan News Agency learned from the shipping industry that the Italian Consulate General in Shanghai recently suddenly notified various Italian shipping companies to prohibit ships sailing on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line and refused to issue export permits. The reason is unknown. The Baoli ship of the Yihua Foreign Company was originally scheduled to sail to Wenzhou on the 11th, but had to suspend navigation temporarily and suspend exports after receiving the order. However, other German and British ships are still sailing as usual. In addition, the Italian ship De Pingchangde is also sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo line as usual and has not suspended navigation.

Four Ships Stranded in Shanghai

According to the Daguan News Agency, the Ender, Enji, Badula, and Kangshayi, four ships of the Sino-Italian Shipping Company on Wuma Road in this city, sailed into the Nanshi blockade line before Italy's participation in the war and entered the company's own shipyard for repairs. They have now been repaired and were originally scheduled to resume navigation. However, due to Italy's participation in the war, and because these ships have always sailed on the South China line, it is impossible to resume navigation for a while. They are currently anchored in Nanshi.

### British, French, and US Ambassadors: Postponement of Move Indefinitely, British and French Ambassadors Still Stationed in Shanghai, No Definite Date for US Ambassador to Leave Chongqing

Since the British and French ambassadors arrived in Shanghai one after another, their work has been very busy due to the impact of the European war. As for the date of the two ambassadors' trip north to avoid the heat, according to the reporter of Pingming News Agency's inquiry from various parties yesterday, British Ambassador Sir Kerr and French Ambassador Cosme have not yet determined the exact date of their trip north as of yesterday. According to Baekeland's inquiry from the US Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday, the date of US Ambassador Johnson's return to Shanghai, according to the US Consul General Bartlett, although there have been repeated rumors that the US Ambassador has a scheduled return to Shanghai, the US Consulate in this city has not received any news that the Ambassador will leave Chongqing and return to Shanghai. As for the rumors that the consular corps is discussing the so-called "free city of the sea," he had no knowledge of it and it was not true.

### Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram to Finance and Economic Ministries Regarding the Release of Detained Goods

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on a letter from the Sichuan Business Public Welfare Association, reports that goods from Shanghai-based national product manufacturers operated by Sichuan merchants are often detained by inspection agencies for more than half a year without being released. The Chamber of Commerce immediately sent a telegram to the Finance and Economic Ministries, requesting that the goods be released swiftly.

### The Conte Verde and Conte Biancamano to Be Converted into Floating Hotels for Italian Émigrés Relocating from the Concessions

According to the English-language China Press, a Japanese source claims that the Italian liners Conte Verde and Conte Biancamano, of 13,000 tons each, moored at pontoons No. 16 and 17 in the Huangpu River since Italy entered the war, may be converted into floating hotels for Italian émigrés relocating from the International and French Concessions. The ships' captains are currently seeking to lease a pier owned by a neutral country's merchant to begin operations. The captains' decision to pursue this new plan stems from their fear that if the liners leave Shanghai, they will be seized by British and French warships. Furthermore, chartering them to a neutral nation is prohibited by international law.

### Ningbo Native Place Famine Relief Donations Exceed One Million Yuan, Second Fundraising Convention Held Yesterday, Ningbo Merchants Decide to Collect Flat-Rate Grain Relief Donations

The second fundraising convention for Ningbo native place famine relief donations was held yesterday at 4:00 PM at the Ningbo Native Place Association. Over 500 Ningbo compatriots attended, and Yu Qiaqing, Qin Runqing, and Zhang Jiguang were publicly elected as the presidium.

Donation Amounts

Wang Boyuan reported on the donation amounts, stating that as of the 2nd, a total of 1,083,000 yuan had been raised, of which 870,000 yuan had already been received. He urged all those who had pledged to donate but not yet paid to do so promptly, and those who had not yet paid in full to complete their payments as soon as possible in order to clear procedures and facilitate the overall plan. Regarding industry-specific pledges, the hardware industry pledged 85,080 yuan, the cotton fabric industry pledged 49,450 yuan, and over 30 other companies in the new medicine, cotton, and iron industries pledged a total of over 300,000 yuan. On the private side, Yu Qiaqing and others generously donated large sums, with Yu Qiaqing personally donating 100,000 yuan, and Yu Qiaqing raising 100,030 yuan, and Qin Runqing raising 77,034 yuan. In addition, approximately 100,000 yuan was pledged on the spot yesterday, including 30,000 yuan from the coal industry. It is understood that another 300,000 yuan in pledges was made yesterday, bringing the total, including the original 1,080,000 yuan, to over 1,400,000 yuan. It is expected that the target of two million yuan will be easily met within days.

Levying Flat-Rate Grain Relief Donations

At the end, the methods of conducting the fundraising were discussed. Someone proposed that, similar to the methods used by the [Refugee] Relief Association for collecting refugee donations, a flat-rate donation be levied on all Ningbo natives engaged in various industries in Shanghai. This was passed. The assembly also decided to convene the third fundraising convention at 4:00 PM on July 6th, and adjourned around 6:00 PM.

### Refugee Sympathizes with France

According to the French-language Shanghai Journal, yesterday afternoon (the 21st), a Chinese man went to the Rue Cardinal Mercier Church to donate five yuan to aid French refugees. This person had been sheltered for several months at the Mascagni Road refugee camp in the French Concession. He is a poor man, and his spirit of generosity deeply moved the French community. The French Red Cross fundraiser for wounded soldiers had raised a total of 198,229.24 yuan, 196,083.04 francs, $90 USD, and £5 GBP as of June 15.

### Shanghai to Sell Family Bread at 38 Cents Each

As a result of efforts by the authorities of the two concessions in negotiation with prominent foreign-owned bakeries and the Chinese Bakeries Association, "standard family bread" will be available for sale in the city starting on the 26th of this month. This bread will contain 80% domestic wheat and 20% foreign wheat. The paper wrapping will be labeled with the words "Family Bread". It will be available in two-pound, one-pound, and eight-liang (approximately 10.5 ounces) sizes. Based on the current exchange rate, the selling price shall not exceed 38 cents per pound and shall not be arbitrarily changed without the approval of the authorities. The various breads and food products currently available at bakeries will continue to be sold at their original prices.

### Japanese Urges Foreign Residents in Chongqing to Evacuate, All Countries Ignore, Never Acknowledged Japanese Right to Bomb

According to news from Chongqing received by diplomatic circles in this city, since Japanese planes have been frequently flying over and indiscriminately bombing Chongqing, the Japanese have made a "recommendation" requesting the evacuation of foreign residents in Chongqing from third countries. However, the foreign residents currently staying in Chongqing have ignored this and have not accepted relocation to the "safe area" designated by the Japanese on the south bank of the Yangtze River. All embassies are also operating as usual. The situation is described in detail below:

Firm Stance

Currently, all embassies in Chongqing are continuing to operate as usual. The British, French, and German embassies in Consular Lane, the American embassy in Guanzigang, the Italian embassy in Mei Yuan in Shangqingsi, and the Belgian embassy in Niujiaotuo have not relocated and have ignored the Japanese "recommendation". The diplomatic guesthouse at Lianglukou and Luojiawan Feilai Temple is also continuing to receive foreign guests. The United States and other countries have never recognized Japan's right to bomb Chongqing or the "safe zone" on the south bank of the Yangtze River designated by the Japanese.

French and Soviet Embassies

Although the French embassy has recently made preparations to relocate from Consular Lane to the south bank, it has been learned that the relocation of the French embassy is by no means an acceptance of the Japanese notice of evacuation for foreign officials and civilians. The continuous bombing of Chongqing has affected the embassy's operations, and to avoid this disturbance, they are voluntarily relocating. It is also understood that after the Soviet embassy was bombed by Japanese planes, it has now relocated and is operating from a new site. The American embassy has also repaired the glass and other damage caused by the bombing.

Foreign Nationals Remain in Chongqing

Most of the foreign nationals residing in Chongqing are from the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, followed by France, Italy, and Belgium. Most of them work in political institutions such as embassies or are engaged in business. A small number are missionaries. They reside near their respective embassies and are unable to leave Chongqing due to their work. The air raid shelters set up by the Chongqing Air Defense Command are sufficient to protect the safety of foreign nationals. Therefore, they have ignored the Japanese "evacuation recommendation" and continue to reside as usual. Foreigners in this city have not received telegrams from relatives and friends to relocate.

### Jewish Residents of This City Zealously Support Britain's War Effort, Eager to Organize a Jewish Army, Leaders of Both Parties Make Eloquent Statements

It was suddenly reported in this city yesterday that the Zionist Alliance is willing to organize a Jewish army to join the Allied Powers and assist in the war effort. The Russian Jewish community in this city was very excited upon hearing this news. According to leaders of various Jewish organizations in Shanghai, if the British government approves this proposal, all Jewish people in this city of military age will immediately enlist. It is noted that there are two Zionist parties, old and new, with branches in Shanghai. It is claimed that among the Russian Jewish party members in China, there are at least a thousand who have received years of military training and can proceed to Europe.

Better to Die Fighting than to Live in Suffering

The leader of the old party's Shanghai branch, Mr. Torpus, declared, "Civilization is currently facing a crisis." When he spoke of the news that Italy had launched a major arrest of Jewish people, he said, "It is better for us to die a glorious death than to live in suffering." The leader of the new party, Mr. Beck, also said, "The Jewish people in China must join immediately." Both leaders expressed heartache over the news of Jewish people being arrested in Palestine. Mr. Beck said, "This is very sad. What more can I say?"

If There is an Opportunity, We Would Gladly Enlist

Mr. Torpus said, "We Jewish people are accustomed to suffering." He also said, "We have suffered for three thousand years. The Jewish people of Central Europe have practically lost half their numbers because, although their bodies are well, their spirits are dead. Most of them will disappear without a trace from now on. If we have the opportunity, we would gladly fight, but we will not only fight for ourselves, but for world civilization. If we allow it to collapse, it will not only be Jewish people who suffer.

Young Russians Eagerly Enlist

In the past, people have not been concerned about the interests of the Jewish people, so we were unwilling to fight for Britain, but we have heard that where British power is strongest, other people have equal opportunities in life. For this reason, Jewish people today sympathize with Britain, and Britain will surely be victorious. Although the situation seems dark now, a year from today there will be a completely different change." It is claimed that most of the young Russian Jewish people here have already registered with Zionist organizations. The aim of this organization is to take back Palestine as a homeland for the Jewish people at any cost.

### Satisfactory Outcome, Huang Yuqi Enthusiastically Provides Assistance, First Batch of Four Tons Issued

Since this spring, coal prices in this city have soared, causing great anxiety for various industries that use coal, especially the bathing industry. The chairman of the industry association, Mr. Huang Yuqi, believed that if the bathing industry was threatened and had to shut down, it would not only create a public health problem for the entire city but would also affect the social stability of over ten thousand unemployed workers. Although Mr. Huang works in the financial sector, he could not stand by and watch the bathing industry face ruin. Therefore, a month ago, he consulted with Yu Qiaqing and Xu Jili and invited several giants of the coal industry to assist. All of them generously agreed. They held a meeting to discuss the matter and appointed Hou Shaoan, Xu Changqing, He Yanjun, and Chen Hanzhang as representatives to approach the Coal Industry Association and the Kailuan Mining Bureau, Jingyi Taixing, Yuantai, Huazhong and other major coal companies to seek supply. After much effort, they were also understood and sympathized with. After two months of hard work, a satisfactory outcome was finally achieved a few days ago. The association received a letter from the Coal Industry Association yesterday, (omitted) stating, "Your industry's request for cheap coal has been negotiated. According to the roster provided, each household will be sold two tons of Kailuan No. 3 coal fines per month at a fixed price of 55 yuan in legal tender per ton. The total of four tons for May and June will be issued first. Please notify your association members, (limited to the safe zone of the concession) from the 24th to the 25th of this month, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM (new time), to bring their seals and the association's certificate to our association to collect the coal purchase certificate (omitted)." It is reported that the bathing industry association, in order to be impartial, has sent all registered members' coal collection certificates, along with a certificate, to the Coal Industry Association for safekeeping. At the same time, it has published a notice in the newspaper and sent letters to all registered members, instructing them to go directly to the Coal Industry Association to apply for coal purchase certificates.

### Memorial Service for Former Chief of the Local Court, Luo Wushen, to Be Held on the 23rd of This Month

After the death of Mr. Luo Wushen, former chief of the local court, in Chongqing, prominent figures such as Xu Shiying, Yu Qiaqing, and Shan Yuhua, remembering his decades of service and lifelong integrity, deemed him a model for the judicial community. Therefore, they chose to hold a memorial service at the Ningbo Native Place Association on Yu Qiaqing Road at 1:00 PM on June 23 of the Gregorian calendar. An excerpt from his announcement is quoted below: "To whom it may concern, the late Mr. Luo Wushen, former chief of the Shanghai Local Court, was well-versed in both Chinese and Western learning and highly respected in the North and South. Mr. Luo served as an official for decades and was generous and charitable in his daily life. Most of his salary was used to assist relatives and friends, so he remained of upright character and suffered from stomach asthma and athlete's foot. When the Shanghai War broke out, Mr. Luo had just retired from his position in Yichang and came to Shanghai, where he closed his doors to recuperate and did not participate in external affairs for more than two years. Mr. Luo was not good at business, so his daily life had become difficult. Shanghai is a place where people from all walks of life gather and factions are divided. There are many people who push and pull and try to win over others. Mr. Luo was well-educated and, although he had experienced difficulties, always valued morality and never wavered. Director Cheng of the Northwest Headquarters repeatedly sent telegrams to invite him to work together. Before his departure, relatives and friends helped him raise travel expenses, and he set off alone on December 21 of the Republic of China's 28th year. On the way to Yunnan via Vietnam, he tragically suffered three bombings. Although he fainted once, he finally arrived in Kunming after many hardships. Friends helped him buy a ticket, and he flew to Chongqing on January 5 of the 29th year. Unexpectedly, a telegram arrived on January 26th, stating that Mr. Luo had passed away at the Chongqing Renji Hospital. We are deeply saddened. Currently, the coffin is in Chongqing and will be returned to his hometown for burial in the future, which will require a considerable sum of money. Moreover, the dead are gone, and how can the living endure? When Mr. Luo left, his luggage was sparse, and there was no money left at home. The livelihood of his family is also a matter of importance. We believe that it is our human duty to help those in need, and we plan to launch a memorial service in Shanghai. All expenses for the burial of the coffin and the livelihood of the family should be raised and planned appropriately to comfort Mr. Luo Wushen's spirit in heaven. All of us should be generous and assist with the spirit of helping those in need. If you would like to donate an eulogy or a wreath, please write on plain paper so that it can be compiled into a booklet for permanent memorial. Because the funds for the coffin and settling the family are indeed vast, we hope that all the expenses for wreaths and couplets will be given in cash, and we also ask for special donations to fulfill this grand wish. We are deeply grateful. Donations can be made to the Bank of Agriculture and Industry on Sanma Road, Henan Road. Wreaths and couplets can be sent to the Shanghai Yu Qiaqing Ningbo Native Place Association Preparation Office.

### Foreign Rice Enters Shanghai Without Obstruction, Noodle Makers Request Flour Allocation Based on Factory List Price

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association sent a letter to the Public Concession Municipal Council yesterday, stating that the recent surge in rice prices is very intense. Although the reasons for the surge are not limited to one, the recent news of Hong Kong's ban on exports is a major cause. The association's members had previously purchased over 100,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. This ban on exports has not only prevented the rice that has already been purchased from being shipped, but will also make it impossible to continue ordering in the future. Although rice can still be shipped from Siam and Annam, the sources from Hong Kong have been cut off from now on. The market has been panicked and people are extremely agitated. If measures are not taken quickly to dredge the situation, it is feared that the surge will be difficult to suppress. It is hoped that every effort will be made to dredge the situation so that the source of food for the Shanghai citizens will not be interrupted. According to external sources, the arrival of rice from Hong Kong has been very strong recently. Although rice from Saigon is very scarce, it still arrives steadily. Over 50,000 bags have left the port and arrived in Shanghai this week.

Inspection and Informing

The resolution to strictly implement the proposal to pay for goods based on the "five-dog" price (a slang term for high prices), and to prevent reselling, was discussed and passed. At the same time, members are encouraged to report and inform on violations, and to strictly punish them. All members have been notified and will be implemented soon. Yesterday morning, the rice market was quiet, and the market price of various goods tended to ease. It is also understood that the Shanghai Price Stabilization Committee plans to continue to telegraph to foreign countries to purchase 40,000 bags of rice. However, 30% of the price of this rice must be paid in advance. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will actively donate.

Requesting Flour Allocation

The Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association submitted a petition to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "We are submitting this petition to request relief from the flour panic. Because manufacturers are unable to freely transport raw materials, the amount of flour has decreased, and the prices of each flour mill vary. It is difficult for members to purchase goods from each mill, or even be cut off. Recently, rice prices have soared, and ordinary people rely on noodles to fill their stomachs. Members have no goods to make, and thus no noodles to supply to the market. Members have come to the association one after another to make requests. The association immediately held a meeting and decided to petition your association to request relief from the authorities. Previously, we were introduced by your association to be supplied with 500 bags per day by the manufacturers. There is too little porridge for too many monks, and it is not enough to allocate. The association has discussed it again and again, and in order not to harm the interests of each flour mill, a handling fee of 3 cents is added to the factory list price. The association notifies members to register and then issues vouchers for purchasing goods from nearby flour mills, so as to avoid the mills making excuses and to facilitate both parties and avoid the difficulty of being cut off. We have no choice but to request your association to forward the request to the Municipal Council, to notify the factory and each flour mill to facilitate business and stabilize the market."

### Hotel Embezzles Refugee Donations, Fined 5,000 Yuan

The case of Shen Yongkang, the general manager of the Dafang Hotel in Zhengjia Muqiao, embezzling 5,000 to 6,000 yuan in refugee donations, has been discovered, and the association is about to file a public prosecution. It is now understood that Shen Yongkang is aware that he is in the wrong. After mediation, there is hope for a settlement: (1) the embezzled funds should be returned in full; (2) a fine of 5,000 yuan should be paid to deter others; and (3) an apology should be published in the newspaper. Shen Yongkang has fully agreed, but it has been opposed by all the shareholders of the hotel, because the fine and compensation should be borne by Shen Yongkang personally. Therefore, the hope for a settlement has been temporarily shelved. It is unknown how it will end in the future.

### Stop Sailing to Japan

The French Postal Shipping Company's Eurasian line regular mail ship, the General Chaffee, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 20th) from Marseille. It was originally scheduled to set sail for Japan at 9:00 AM this morning. According to the company, the ship has been ordered by the head office to stop sailing to Japan and stay in Shanghai temporarily. It is scheduled to return to Europe from Shanghai next Tuesday (the 25th). The Java Company's Tschisedanne, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 8:00 AM tomorrow, docking at the Pootung Blue Funnel Wharf.

### Mr. Yu Qiaqing's 74th Birthday

Today is the 74th birthday of Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a leading figure in industry and commerce in this city. All walks of life in this city, because Yu has benefited the society and contributed to people's livelihood, originally wanted to raise a glass to congratulate him, but because it is a time of emergency, there are no ostentatious ceremonies except for a few close friends and relatives who congratulate him. Although Yu has reached an advanced age, because of his daily life

Strict Adherence to Rules

His daily life and diet are in accordance with the principles of hygiene, so he is energetic and healthy, without the dragon-like appearance of the average elderly. Yu is quite talkative, and he talks a lot about people's livelihood and welfare. When the reporter visited yesterday, it was said that the city has recently had a

Sharp Rise in Rice Prices

The extent is unprecedented in history. In previous years, this city has also experienced high rice prices due to several famines, but the highest price per picul was only 16 or 17 yuan, which is a surprisingly different multiple compared to the current situation. Although there are reasons for the recent surge in rice prices, the rapid increase has clearly deviated from the general

Natural Trend

Because there is still a lot of rice in stock in this city, there is no cause for panic. Therefore, I deeply hope that ordinary merchants should understand the difficulties of the people and should not excessively raise prices, causing countless compatriots to feel the pain of having nothing to eat. As for the price stabilization matter, Yu said that he is currently raising funds and it can be implemented in the near future.

### Over Two Hundred British Residents Organize Anti-Slackers Brigade, Carry Out Various Activities Beneficial to the Motherland

Representatives from various British businesses and factories in this city participated. Some factories even stopped work early so that workers could participate in this gathering. The Chairman of the Municipal Council, Mr. Keswick, also attended and provided guidance. As a result, over eight hundred British residents expressed their willingness to participate in this organization and carry out various activities beneficial to the motherland. In the future, members will be dispatched to various British merchant ships to perform guard duty to prevent enemy sabotage. At the same time, various British godowns and factories in this city will also be left to guard, to perform various possible defenses.

It is heard that a portion of the brigade has now begun service.

### Our Newspaper Readers Assist Mr. Liu with Tuition Fees: Compassionate Individuals Eagerly Donate Funds, Education Authorities Thoroughly Investigate the Truth of the Case

Mr. Liu Shusheng, a native of Ningbo, resides at No. 167 Jinyu Lane, Mintini Yin Road, and currently works as a street performer playing traditional Chinese music. He has two daughters: the elder, Fengying (15 years old), and the younger, Yunying (12 years old), both studying at Zhendong Elementary School, located at the intersection of Glock Road and Pi Shao Nai Road. The two students are naturally intelligent and always rank first in every exam. However, due to the impact of the war, Mr. Liu's situation is exceptionally dire, leaving him unable to pay the 21 yuan tuition fee for his two daughters. As a result, the school's principal, Fan Shenxiong, provided a guarantee to the Special Second Court, requesting a provisional attachment. A court hearing was held the day before yesterday. Upon reading this news, Mr. Guo Pengfei, a reader of this newspaper, was deeply moved and wished to contribute 11 yuan towards the tuition fees. Simultaneously, Principal Fan Shenxiong and a commissioned lawyer sent letters stating the details of the matter, claiming to have a clear conscience. All of this was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Since the disclosure of this news, society has not lacked compassionate individuals, who have eagerly entrusted this newspaper with donations. The details are recorded as follows:

Guo Pengfei Takes the Lead in Sponsoring

Mr. Guo Pengfei, who first advocated assisting with the tuition fees, personally visited this newspaper at around 8 o'clock last night. He was received by a reporter from this newspaper. According to Mr. Guo, he himself was unable to study as a child due to family circumstances and suffered the same hardships. Although his current situation is not wealthy, driven by righteous indignation, he would rather gather this sum and requested that it be forwarded. As he spoke, he took out 11 yuan. Upon receiving the donation, the reporter expressed deep respect.

Compassionate Individuals Respond in Succession

Since this newspaper revealed the above news yesterday morning, an anonymous reader sent 40 yuan with a letter, stating that they did not wish to seek fame or praise, but expressed concern for some young compatriots who have lost the opportunity to study. Therefore, they gathered this sum as a gift. Mr. Cheng Fulin wrote, stating that pursuing tuition fee recovery through litigation is a strange occurrence in an isolated island and is truly shameful, also contributing 10 gold. In addition, Mr. Pu Qiting contributed 10 yuan, and an anonymous reader contributed 10 yuan, totaling 70 yuan. Combined with the 11 yuan personally sent by Mr. Guo Pengfei, the total is 81 yuan.

Mr. Liu Receives the Funds and Issues a Receipt

After receiving the aforementioned funds, this newspaper immediately sent personnel to Mr. Liu Shusheng's residence to have him come to the newspaper office to collect them. According to him, after this newspaper published the news, compassionate individuals offered assistance, for which he felt deeply grateful. He vowed to carefully preserve the received funds and use them exclusively for the education of his two daughters. This newspaper then requested him to write an official receipt, which is reproduced here for credibility. Mr. Liu's father stated that Mr. Zhang Yezhi, a local comedian and playwright, had sent a representative, Gu Mengchi, with 21 yuan in cash on the morning of the day before yesterday (21st) to subsidize the tuition fees, which was truly commendable. Furthermore, three elementary school students came to the newspaper office and wished to donate their funds for cakes and snacks to little friends who are unable to study. They were informed that Mr. Liu had already received some funds, sufficient for several semesters of schooling, and that they did not need to donate any further. The three elementary school students then left joyfully.

All Schools Should Universally Establish Scholarships

From this, it can be seen that the readers of this newspaper possess a strong sense of chivalry and enthusiasm. It is hoped that this spirit can be upheld and applied to various endeavors, so that the entire society may benefit from it. Furthermore, this newspaper considers the issue of Mr. Liu's tuition fees to be concluded. If there are any other enthusiastic individuals willing to assist impoverished students, they may wish to select schools that are dedicated to education and discuss establishing scholarships to benefit all impoverished students in the city.

Education Authorities Dispatch Personnel for Thorough Investigation

According to a report from the Dihua News Agency, relevant authorities in the municipal education administration believe that pursuing tuition fee recovery through litigation is inappropriate and have dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth of the matter for verification. It is hoped that the education authorities will handle the matter impartially in order to rectify discipline.

Shuping Elementary School Wishes to Cultivate

The General Administration Office of Shuping Free Elementary School, located at No. of North Suzhou Road in this city, sent a letter stating (excerpt omitted). After reading the news segment, the office expresses deep sympathy for Mr. Liu's difficult situation and deep admiration for Mr. Guo's enthusiastic assistance. The office has always had the desire to assist and cultivate young, studious children from impoverished families who are unable to pursue education. If Mr. Liu's two daughters achieve a total average score of 85 or above in the school's final exam this semester and wish to continue their studies next semester but are unable to afford the tuition fees, the office is willing to subsidize their tuition fees and book fees for the next semester to enable them to pursue further education. Regarding the aforementioned tuition fees owed by Mr. Liu, the office is also happy to pay them on his behalf. A special letter is sent to inform you of this matter. It is hoped that Mr. Liu can be informed to bring the report cards of his two daughters' final exams this semester to the office for a face-to-face discussion.

### The Case of the Missing Chinese Detective Has Been Resolved

The whereabouts of Yao Changmin, Chinese detective No. 219 of the Jing'an Temple Precinct of the Public Concession, who has been missing for many days, have been of great concern to the public. The He Police Department has now learned of his whereabouts. It is neither a kidnapping nor a disappearance. Someone filed a lawsuit against him in the pseudo-"court" in Western Shanghai, and he was arrested by the pseudo-"bailiffs." He is currently under "secret detention" for investigation. Therefore, witnesses at the time stated that Detective Yao was taken away by four Chinese men wearing uniforms. In fact, the men in uniforms were the pseudo-"bailiffs."

### The Small Owner of a Tea Shop Commits Adultery: Fails to Appear for Trial Out of Fear of Punishment, Arrest Warrant Issued in Court, Indicted on Charges of Adultery and Drug Use, Ordered to Increase Bail and Scheduled for Sentencing

Chen Xinji, a native of Jiading, is 27 years old and the son of Chen Jiruo, a tycoon in the tea shop business. He owns as many as seven famous tea shops, including Laoda Fang, Tianlu, and Yeziqi. He currently serves as the accountant at the Yeziqi branch at No. 541 Xiwusi Road, Xiafei Road. In the first month of the Republic of China year 20, he married Cao Junying (resident of No. 1, Mingde Lane, Ladu Road), a fellow native of the same age, and they have had

One Son, One Daughter

The son is named Huizhong (5 years old), and the daughter is named Huihua (3 years old). The relationship between husband and wife is still harmonious. However, Chen is pampered and enjoys a comfortable life. He frequently visits singing and dancing venues, leading to an inextricable relationship with a dancer named Lu Yingxia (also known as Qi Pei, 25 years old, a native of Guangdong, resident of No. 322 Wenlin Road, whose father works for a certain business company). He then rented a house to hide her in the overhanging building at No. 7 Shanqingfang, Kangti Road, and provided her with clothing and footwear worth no less than several thousand yuan. From then on, he treated his loyal wife

As Worn-Out Shoes

And neglected the living expenses of his children. Therefore, Cao once filed a lawsuit against Chen in the Civil Mediation Office of the Special Court for cohabitation and payment of 100 yuan per month for living expenses. As a result, Chen lacked sincerity, and mediation failed. Recently, Chen has been avoiding meeting and has not visited his wife at all. Cao then went around asking people to investigate her husband's whereabouts and learned that he had another lover. On the 15th of this month, at 6:30 a.m., she, accompanied by lawyers Yuan Hanyun and Wu Xiaolin, reported the information to the French Concession police, who dispatched detectives to

Arrest Them Both

And seized exquisite opium smoking paraphernalia from the two. They were jointly escorted to the Eighth Criminal Tribunal of the Special Second Court. After questioning by Judge Qiu Huan-ying, the two defendants were ordered to each pay a reliable shop guarantee of 2,000 yuan for attendance as summoned. All the details were reported in this newspaper. The hearing resumed yesterday morning. The two defendants, fearing punishment, avoided appearing in court. The court ordered the issuance of arrest warrants. After they were arrested in the afternoon, the hearing continued. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi stood up and stated that the two defendants had been examined by a forensic doctor,

Confirmed to Have a Smoking Addiction

Therefore, they are being prosecuted for opium smoking and disrupting the family. Although the two defendants met in October of last year, the plaintiff had reported her husband's adultery to the police last year, and there are case files available. Therefore, the six-month statute of limitations has not been exceeded. The court is requested to administer the deserved punishment according to the law. The lawyers for the two defendants argued that the statute of limitations had expired and requested a judgment of non-acceptance. The plaintiff commissioned lawyers Yuan and Wu to

File a Civil Suit

Seeking compensation of 10,000 yuan for mental and material losses and proposed to file separate lawsuits for alimony, child support, and consolation money for the future divorce. After reviewing the statements, the court ordered that the case be scheduled for judgment on the morning of the 29th. Fearing that the two defendants might flee, in addition to the original bail, they were each ordered to pay an additional cash bail of 500 yuan. Before the cash bail is paid, they will be returned to custody.

### Large Gang of Bandits Robs the Guohua and Minsheng Factories: Residents Exceptionally Alarmed

According to Huawen News Agency, banditry has recently resurged in the western Shanghai area. At 1:30 a.m. yesterday morning, 17 bandits paid a visit to the Sihua Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 199F, Lane 99 (commonly known as Nancaojiazhai), Jisi Fei Road. The bandits first climbed in through the skylight on the roof, then opened the main gate to let the gang in, and then locked the main gate. At that time, the factory was working the night shift. The bandits each took out box cannons, forbidding any noise, and searched each of the female workers. They then broke into the accounting office and thoroughly searched it. A worker from the factory, named Jia, seized the opportunity to report by telephone to the "pseudo-bureau." The "bureau" immediately dispatched more than 20 police officers, who surrounded the factory on all sides. However, the bandits had already robbed more than 4,000 yuan in legal tender and escaped through the back door, causing the "pseudo-police" to toil in vain without gaining anything. Also, at 12:00 a.m. the night before last, 20 bandits patronized the Minsheng Silk Weaving Factory at No. 25. They also hired a truck, which was parked nearby. After the bandits broke into the factory, they first placed the factory staff under surveillance, then moved machinery and more than 30 bolts of silk onto the truck one after another, stepped on the gas, and sped away. As the bandits left, they fired a shot into the sky and said, "Be careful, we will ransack the entire area sooner or later." Therefore, the residents of the area are exceptionally alarmed.

### The Owner of the Yongxin Weaving Factory Was Sued: Acquitted on Appeal

Xu Yongkang, the director of the Yongxin Weaving Factory, had previously advertised the sale of the house at No. 125 Dayi Village, Lane 569, Albert Road. Huang Shihuan saw the advertisement and went to negotiate, agreed on a price, and paid a deposit. Unexpectedly, Huang suddenly changed his mind, wanting to return the deposit, and filed a lawsuit against Xu for fraud in the Second Special District Court. Xu was sentenced to a fine of 500 yuan and a suspended sentence of two years. It is now learned that Xu refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyer Xue Ziming to appeal to the Third High Court. After a review by Judge Wu, the evidence was deemed conclusive. Yesterday (21st), the original judgment was overturned, and Xu was acquitted. The incidental civil suit was dismissed.

### Fire at the Fuxin No. 7 Flour Mill

At around 8:30 p.m. yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in the machinery factory on the eighth floor of the Fuxin Flour No. 7 Mill at No. 101, Lane 1095, North Chengdu Road, due to the re-ignition of accumulated cloth. Machinery and belts were burned and other parts were damaged. Fortunately, the fire brigade arrived and quickly extinguished the fire. The losses were minimal.

### The Epidemic Hospital Opens Early: Cholera Continues to Be Discovered

Since the discovery of true cholera in this city, the health threat to citizens has been severe. In addition to the four previously discovered patients, the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital recently diagnosed another patient with true cholera, named Xu Shaoshi, 33 years old, a native of Shaoxing, and currently residing at No. 5, Wuding Lane, Wuding Road. According to Deng Qingshan, the director of medical affairs at the hospital, as of yesterday, a total of five patients with true cholera have been discovered in this city, and most of them came to Shanghai from Shaoxing to escape the famine. This is particularly noteworthy. Currently, due to the abnormal weather, in addition to true cholera, gastrointestinal inflammation is also extremely prevalent. The Epidemic Prevention Department of the Epidemic Hospital was opened early on the 21st, and citizens should also pay close attention to their diet and living arrangements.

### Real Estate Merchant Huang Ronghui Abducted While Riding a Horse in the Early Morning: Bandits Forcibly Put Him in a Car and Fired Shots as a Warning, The License Plate Was Forged, The Police Are Investigating

Huang Ronghui, a native of Guangdong, is currently 58 years old. He has been in Shanghai for over a thousand years.

At around 8:15 a.m. yesterday morning, Huang, wearing a white canvas suit and coffee-colored breeches, as usual, drove his No. 3913 car to the riding school on Daxi Road and rode out on horseback. As he was riding along the side of Daxi Road, three bandits suddenly appeared on the roadside. Two of them brandished pistols, ordered him to dismount, and forcibly put him in a No. 2802 car that was parked on the side of the road. The car sped west and escaped. As the bandits left, they fired a shot as a warning. Afterwards, an eyewitness reported the situation to the Jing'an Temple Precinct police for investigation. According to the police yesterday morning, the license plate of the car used by the abductors was forged. However, the details are still under investigation. Huang's abduction is the same as the abduction of famous doctor Zhou Junchang and engineer Gu Pengcheng, who were kidnapped while riding in Western Shanghai on the 18th of last month.

### Cautious Admonitions by Zeng Wenzhenggong (2)

Third, diligently study to broaden your talents. The world today is filled with many complex matters, but they can be summarized into four categories: military affairs, administrative affairs, financial affairs, and literary affairs. All those who come here should specialize in one of these four categories. Those who study military affairs should study war, offense, defense, terrain, and enemy situations. Those who study administrative affairs should study comforting the people, urging tax payment, hearing lawsuits, and agriculture. Those who study financial affairs should study land tax, customs duties, revenue sources, and expenditures. Those who study literary affairs should study memorials, regulations, official documents, and letters. The method of study is nothing more than learning and questioning. Learn from the past by reading more books; learn from the present by seeking more examples. Question those in charge to understand the difficulties; question bystanders to understand the effects. Diligent study without ceasing will naturally broaden your talents without you realizing it. Fourth, guard against arrogance and laziness to rectify customs. I have been in the military for a long time and do not understand numerology or divination, but I am quite able to foresee the signs of defeat. Generally, generals who are arrogant will be defeated, and those who are lazy will be defeated. This is not only true of generals, but also of all committee members. Those who are arrogant will inevitably ruin matters, and those who are lazy will inevitably be blamed. The origins of arrogance and laziness are subtle, but over time they become customs. If one person is self-righteous, then they will proclaim themselves a sage. If one person gets up late, then the whole country will turn day into night. I now agree with you all to do more practical things and say fewer big words. Do not avoid hard work, and do not boast of merit. If everyone keeps this in mind, then careers will emerge, customs will be rectified, and talents will flourish.

### Finance and Foreign Exchange: Rumors Shift, Yesterday's Buyers Appear Strong Again

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The trend of the British and American exchange rates in the grey market was unstable, softening after a sharp rise. People are wary of changes in the situation and environment, and their attention is constantly shifting. The market initially appeared quite loose, with Chinese speculators selling aggressively and lacking buyers. Therefore, the American exchange rate once fell to 6.1875 yuan around 10:30 a.m. However, people's hearts were soon shaken, and Chinese banks began to settle, as did the Yokohama Specie Bank. Many short sellers covered their positions, so demand exceeded supply. By the time the market closed at noon, the British gold exchange rate had fallen to 3 shillings 9.6875 pence, and the American exchange rate had entered the 6 yuan range, at 5.96875 yuan. Compared to the previous day's closing, both the British and American exchange rates softened by 0.0625 and 0.03125 respectively. The loose trend of futures was no different from that of spot prices. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Shorts Aggressively Cover After the Drop

In the early morning, the London exchange rate fell by 3.75 points for the near term and 0.0625 for the far term. New York silver prices remained flat, and London bullion prices were stable. The exchange rate for London was unchanged, up 0.0625 points for Shanghai, and unchanged for France. The American exchange rate was up 5.75 points for London, up 20 cents for Shanghai, and no telegraphs for France. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with a spot selling price of 4 shillings for British currency and 6 yuan for the American exchange rate in the morning, which was flat and slightly tighter by 0.03125 points compared to the previous day's evening closing. Chinese speculators sold aggressively after opening, and the market loosened. They sold 6.0625 yuan and even 6.15625 yuan for American currency for this month to the foreign exchange market and speculators. HSBC's listed prices were announced with no changes. The silver half-balance tax was reduced by 2.00 percent. After that, Chinese speculators continued to dump, and prices became extremely loose. Spot American currency was sold cheaply by the foreign exchange market to speculators for 6.1875 yuan. The American currency for July was also traded at 6.0625 yuan. Although it stabilized slightly later, around 10:40 a.m., the current American currency rate was still 6.125 yuan, and the British gold rate was 4 shillings 0.46875 pence. The British exchange rate for the current American currency for June was also sold by foreign banks for 6.125 yuan. However, Chinese banks suddenly rose to settle, and the Yokohama Specie Bank also came to buy. The market image then changed. First, Chinese banks absorbed the British banks' American currency for June at 6.0625 yuan. The Yokohama Specie Bank entered the foreign exchange market, first making the spot rate drop to 4 shillings. At that time, rumors arose in the market, and people's hearts were slightly affected, and short covering increased. By the time the market closed at noon, the British gold exchange rate had returned to 3 shillings 9.6875 pence, and the American exchange rate was 5.96875 yuan. The British gold exchange rate for the next month was 3 shillings 9.0625 pence, and the American exchange rate was 5.84375 yuan. Compared to the previous night's closing, spot British currency was 0.0625 points tighter, and American currency was 0.03125 points softer. The British currency for July also contracted by 0.0625 points, and the American currency tightened by 0.05125 points. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

### Chinese and Foreign Bank Instruments

Entrusting Zhejiang Industrial to Act as Agent for the Exchange of Huayi Bank. The clearing of instruments between Chinese merchant banks and foreign merchant banks in this city has always been handled by Chinese merchant banks, which concentrated at the instrument clearing house run by the United Preparatory Committee of the banking industry, starting the exchange at 3:30 p.m. The member banks of the Foreign Merchant Bank Association cleared their instruments by having each bank send personnel to the HSBC Bank every day to exchange tickets, with the exchange time being 12:30 p.m. from Monday to Friday and 11:30 a.m. on Saturday. Chinese merchant banks, in order to facilitate the payment of foreign merchant bank instruments, mostly opened current accounts with foreign merchant banks. However, when foreign merchant banks received instruments from Chinese merchant banks, they ordered that they be exchanged separately for foreign merchant bank checks or bank preparatory funds allocation slips, and settled accounts with the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Bank. Because the clearing mechanisms of Chinese and foreign banks are not unified, the circulation of instruments is hindered. For example, if a Chinese merchant bank receives an instrument payable by a foreign merchant bank, it must be received before noon in order to be deposited. After noon, it must be entered into the account for the next day. Mr. Yongyu of the banking community, in view of this, once published an article in the Banking Journal entitled "Preliminary Proposal for Centralized Clearing of Instruments of Chinese and Foreign Merchant Banks," advocating that foreign merchant banks should participate in Chinese merchant bank instrument clearing houses. Recently, the Huayi Bank, in order to facilitate the circulation of instruments and eliminate the cumbersome and time-consuming roundabout procedures of previous instrument clearing, decided to join the Chinese merchant bank instrument clearing house by means of entrusting an agent for exchange. It entrusted the Zhejiang Industrial Bank to act as an agent for exchanging instruments. This has been approved by the executive committee meeting of the United Preparatory Committee of the banking industry, and it is scheduled to begin joining the agency exchange tomorrow (24th), opening the precedent for foreign merchant banks to join the Chinese merchant bank instrument exchange, it is said.

### Gold Market Potential Turns Firm

Yesterday, the spot market for pure gold was dull. After an initial drop, it recovered slightly, and the situation was mediocre. Operators were entering and exiting frequently, but transactions were active with small quantities. Price fluctuations also narrowed. The morning price was 5,400 yuan, 85 yuan lower than the previous close. At that time, due to frequent reports of fluctuating exchange rates, the price was suppressed around the 5,450 yuan level, unable to rise. Later, due to rumors of favorable news, the exchange rate tightened, triggering considerable buying interest from banks and other institutions. There was some downward pressure, reportedly due to heavy selling by a certain gold firm. The highest price reached only 5,520 yuan, and the market closed at 5,510 yuan, up 25 yuan from the previous evening's settlement. There was no trading on Saturday afternoon, but the market sentiment outside the exchange remained firm. The after-hours price was 30 yuan higher than the afternoon close, but there was little selling pressure. The trading volume for the half-day was about 2,800 taels. Jewelry shops increased the price of gold ornaments by 10 yuan. Customs gold remained flat.

Pure Gold Rises 25 Yuan

Since morning, the price per bar (10 taels) initially opened 85 yuan lower due to the weak exchange rate, with gold firms selling. Gold firms sold 30 taels to banks at 5,400 yuan. Subsequently, a certain gold firm suddenly developed buying interest, and banks also joined in, immediately pushing the price back up to 5,480 yuan, with banks trading 10 taels among themselves. Soon after, a money exchange suddenly sold, and securities firms followed suit, pushing the price down again by 60 yuan, with securities firms selling 20 taels to banks at 5,420 yuan. Later, as banks' appetite remained strong, the price rose again, and soon the exchange rate was reported to have weakened, and buying interest gradually increased. Although a certain gold firm was selling in between, the price was eventually pushed up by 100 yuan, with banks buying 20 taels from money exchanges at 5,520 yuan. After this, the buying interest slowed down, and banks took profits, pushing the price down to 5,450 yuan again. At noon, buying interest resurfaced, as the exchange rate was tighter than the previous day, and there were rumors that the "New Central" Bank would issue banknotes. As a result, operators rushed to buy, and gold firms were eager to cover their short positions, driving the price up to 5,520 yuan again. Subsequently, banks traded 10 taels among themselves, setting the noon closing price at 5,510 yuan, a rise of 25 yuan compared to the previous day. The after-hours market situation was even better, reaching as high as 5,540 yuan, with a fluctuation of 120 yuan in the half-day. The current selling price of spot gold by gold firms is several dozen yuan higher than the marked price, and the buy-in price is 30 yuan lower. The current price for standard gold is over 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there is little trading activity.

Jewelry Gold Up 10 Yuan

The selling price of gold jewelry by jewelry shops was initially 560 yuan per tael at Da Tong Hang, but was later raised by 10 yuan at noon. There were no further changes after that. Da Tong Hang now lists the price at 570 yuan. The price at Xin Tong Hang is the same, with the buy-in price around 30 yuan lower.

### Call Loan Rate Reduced by One Cent

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange bills was consistently 72 yuan per thousand yuan for buy-in and 78 yuan for sell-out throughout the day, a decrease of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. The call loan rate of the Money Trade Association was lowered by one cent, to 2.5 cents.

### Foreign Currencies Fluctuate Frequently

Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw pure gold fluctuating upwards, with British and American gold pounds following suit. There was some demand for British gold notes, and the market price rose slightly. The price of American gold notes initially fell to 16.08 yuan, but rumors that a certain bank would dump a large amount of foreign exchange on the black market caused the market price to rise sharply, once reaching as high as 16.70 yuan. In the afternoon, it fluctuated to 16.50 yuan, but it was still better than the previous day by 10 cents. The price of Hong Kong notes rose in the morning but returned to flat in the afternoon. The price of Canadian and Philippine notes both rose by 20 cents. The demand for Japanese gold notes increased slightly, and the evening price was 1.09 yuan. The price of Korean notes rose slightly to 95 cents.

### Grains and Rice Prices Are Too High, Still Fluctuating by One Yuan

Rice prices, after turning flat previously, had some fluctuations yesterday, but the fluctuation in the entire city was only around one yuan, unlike the drastic changes in the past. This is because prices have already been raised sufficiently, and customers generally find it difficult to cope with the retail prices. Although the supply of foreign rice is said to be difficult to transport from coastal defense areas, Siam can still trade unhindered, and road shipments are continuously arriving. Warehouses in Shanghai also have rich reserves. Under these circumstances, how can the market continue to rise? Therefore, at the opening of the market in the morning, both buyers and sellers were watching and did not dare to buy rashly. There were few transactions at that time, and the situation was very sluggish. The prices of various foreign rice varieties once fell by one yuan. No. 1 Saigon old rice was sold for only 65 yuan, and Small Pattern rice was sold for 61 yuan. However, after this decline, it immediately stimulated strong buying interest from shops and domestic clients. Speculators, who had intended to lure the market before trapping it, saw the market turning slightly and immediately took action, pushing up the prices and shouting orders. The prices of various varieties immediately returned to their original levels. After this, although sellers were still trying to push the price higher, sales quickly weakened, and the market turned into a fluctuating state. By the afternoon, those who had made profits competed to sell, and the market began to fall by half a yuan to nearly one yuan. Small Pattern rice closed in the evening at only 61 yuan, 61.30 yuan at the bank warehouses, and the price of original packages retrieved was 66.50 yuan. No. 2 Siam rice shipped in 18-pack was initially received at 70 yuan, but fell to 68 yuan in the afternoon, and the closing price rose by 50 cents again. The 26-pack shipment also opened at 68 yuan, but there were no further settlements. No. 2 Saigon rice shipped at the beginning of the month opened at 68 yuan. In total, 250 tons of retrieved goods arrived, and 7,500 packages of spot goods were offered.

There were over 1,000 packages of Japanese glutinous rice and japonica rice arriving successively. It is rumored that the after-hours trading of japonica rice is still flat, similar to before, while the sales of glutinous rice on the market have become less active than before. Therefore, although cargo owners continue to try to push prices higher, they have not succeeded, and the result is still flat. The prices of all varieties remain unchanged. Jin Shen Special Yuan is still listed at 60.05 yuan to 60.10 yuan, Chang Dan goods are around 59 yuan, and Jiangbei Bai Yuan is 57 or 58 yuan.

### This Factory Suffers from Lack of Wheat; Japanese Factories Sell Futures

Wheat Flour: The market remained strong yesterday. Daily supply for actual sales is estimated at around 6,000 packages. Sales to out-of-town clients have long been unrestricted, so the price of retrieved flour from out-of-town clients reached as high as 16.50 yuan. The old cart warehouse receipt must also be 14.50 yuan, with some differences in between. As for the Chinese factories, because the wheat harvest has been under control, it is difficult to find a way to dredge the supply. It is feared that the raw materials will not be able to keep up in the future, and it will be difficult to continue retail sales on this street. As for the Japanese factories, they have a slightly better grasp of purchasing new wheat, so they have even pre-sold futures.

Wheat: The transportation problem has not yet returned to normal. Although a small number of wheat shipments have arrived at nearby Kunshan and Taicang, the price has gradually increased. A formal market is probably still pending.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Remain Stable as Before

The after-hours securities market was stable and remained stable as before, without any excitement. Trading continued to decrease. The general public is still speculating about Stimson's appearance and Song Ziwen's flight to the United States. In short, in this turbulent time, the bond market can still be firm, which shows the confidence of the bondholders. The principal and interest of the ninth issue will soon be due, and it is expected that it will still be paid as before. Therefore, there is no other reason to look forward to a rise or fall in the future. Yesterday, Datong Yitai and general retail investors sold one after another, while Dafeng, Tianfeng, Houda and Wanchun bought one after another. Therefore, the result was that Class A and B continued to be good by one cent, while the rest were flat without any fluctuations. The total trading volume was only around 300,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below.

Stock trading: 100 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity shares were traded, at a price of 6.25 yuan.

London, 21st (Friday): Today's market for British Far East companies' stocks saw banking stocks weakening. Jardine Matheson & Co. shares fell half a pound to 6 pounds 15 shillings. HSBC's UK-registered shares fell 2 pounds to 66 pounds, and Hong Kong-registered shares fell 1 pound to 72 pounds. Chartered Bank shares fell 7 shillings and 6 pence to 12 pounds. The rest saw minor movements.

London, 21st (Friday): Today's market for Chinese foreign bonds remained stable. The prices of all bonds remained unchanged, hovering around the 1,000 yuan mark.

### Cotton Yarn and Raw Cotton Markets Barely Survive; Double Horse Hovering Around 1,000 Yuan

The yarn market was slightly stable, with a stable trend. This is because the Japanese warships gathered in the South China Sea, but the sea route from Hong Kong to Haiphong has resumed, and various shipping companies are operating as usual, transporting goods. This has slightly improved people's mood, so that the exhausted yarn market can be temporarily supported. However, the June delivery may cause problems.

At the opening of the spot yarn market in the morning, the atmosphere in the market was mediocre due to the weakness of the exchange rate and the shortness of the gold price. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 960 yuan, falling to 955 yuan. Later, because the bulls slightly stirred and bought in, and there was a rumor of favorable news, the price rose to 988 yuan. However, after the price rose, there were few buyers again, and it fell back to 970 yuan. After the close, it was heard that someone was buying, and it rose by more than 10 yuan. The half-day turnover was 1,575 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 11 yuan. The amount bought by each group is listed below:

Same trade: 160 Hong Kong: 330

Ningbo: 55 Inland: 50

Total: 1,575

### Raw Cotton Market Greatly Devalued; After-Hours Trading Unwilling to Announce, Fearing It Will Hinder the Market

The spot cotton market is completely cut off. Because the yarn market is weak, the factories have sufficient cotton in stock to meet the needs of the new cotton season, so there are no purchases all day long. As for the same trade, most of the cotton ordered from overseas has arrived in full, and there is little strength to develop at present. A little trading on the market is all after-hours trading, because the prices are too low in formal trading, they are unwilling to announce.

Another report is that the price of foreign cotton on the market was weak yesterday. Because there was a lack of major buyers on the market, and the Southern trade group sold short, the closing price was higher in the near term by one pound, and lower in the long term by three or four pounds. The Indian cotton market fell by two rupees yesterday, including forecasts.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very quiet recently, with no improvement on all sides, and it is quite stagnant. Although the factories all have no inventory for February, they have no intention of purchasing. According to the current situation, the future is difficult to see as bright.

### Retrospective on the Yarn Industry Turmoil

The disastrous defeat of the yarn industry this time can be described as unprecedented. There is hardly a day without companies going bankrupt and being liquidated. There are already dozens of companies that have been made public. There are even more who have absconded without settling their debts, and those who are in a fence-sitting position between seeming to be bankrupt and not bankrupt. The sharp decline in market prices, which leaves practitioners no room to breathe, is a major reason. However, the one who tied the bell must untie it. The blind raising of prices in the past, not following the correct path, sowing melons and reaping melons, the consequences are not a little bit wrong. However, the reasons for the past disastrous defeat may be explored to leave a lesson for the future.

(1) Lack of Strict Membership Review: Membership in the industry association must be subject to strict review. Those who are not engaged in the cotton yarn industry should not be eligible for membership. Regulations such as capital requirements must be investigated. However, the implementers always prioritize personal relationships and focus on membership fees. They refuse no one, which has created a mixture of good and bad members. The number of members has increased sharply, and the order is poor. Among them, there are many who have bad intentions and make desperate bets. Therefore, they stir up trouble and act recklessly. When the backlash comes, how can they not be completely defeated?

(2) Unfair Handling of Bad Debts: If industry events can be handled fairly, the problem will not spread like wildfire. However, some people protect their relatives. For example, a certain firm is not self-sufficient, which leads to poor turnover. When they come out to talk about bad debts, it is one or two cents, or two or three cents that settles the matter (in fact, the bankrupts escape and hoard private savings, they are not really bankrupt). Afterwards, the firm can still join the association and continue to operate as usual, like a "bath". If you don't talk about credibility like this, it is not surprising that cunning people think about taking advantage, and going bankrupt is not considered strange.

(3) Manipulating Market Control Methods: What is even more despised by the industry is that they often use their own business situation, such as the market price standard for the hard closing price in May, and the previous announcements forbidding futures trading by faking orders, in order to control market prices and enrich their own pockets. Moreover, during the time of raising prices, they blindly follow suit without considering the pros and cons. For example, a certain yarn 20-count Yueqin brand (in industry terminology, it is called a football goods, meaning the object of chasing the deer) was raised to a highest price of more than 1,800 yuan. At the same time, the price of the same goods and those with higher bodies than the Yueqin brand was instead pressed down to 5 or 600 yuan. The lack of rational blind following can be seen from this. As for today's counter-movement, it is also not following the correct path, and there are also reasons for this (the recent low price of Yueqin brand is only around 800 yuan, and it is also a rare event that the difference from the high price is thousands of yuan). The association's transactions were originally based on domestically produced cotton yarn. Those who occasionally run a certain kind of yarn mostly do it secretly and dare not openly trade. After the association's address was expanded, it used the entire second floor exclusively for this kind of buying and selling, without collecting fixed foreign currency. Therefore, everyone followed suit. Since there are many operators, the storm is also great. Those who have bad intentions are like buying lottery tickets, winning the jackpot, and fleeing if they don't win. Therefore, with the coming of counter-movements, there are many who abscond, and those who are involved in turn are mostly harmed by it. Without any maintenance, the number of bankrupts is so great. In addition, the fact that intermediaries never take responsibility and set up their own firms to transfer accounts and scrape oil is also closely related to the entire yarn industry. People outside the industry do not know and mistakenly enter the shell, and there are many who lose their families and businesses. (Xiang)

### Silk and Tea: Lake Silk Shipped to Europe, Transshipped to New York

Before the fall of Paris, European and American companies rushed to load cargo of Shanghai Lake Silk shipped to Europe. However, it is recently learned that the raw silk exported from Shanghai in early June failed to reach its destination and was picked up separately in Hong Kong and a certain place in Yidong and transshipped to New York. The sale of European silk has now fallen into despair, and the resumption of Euro-Asian transportation is indefinite. The Shanghai silk market only has the United States as its main customer.

It is rumored that a special tax of 12% will be levied on domestic silk transported to Shanghai starting in July. It is calculated that each dan of white factory silk will have to pay 600 yuan, and earth silk will have to pay 300 yuan. However, it is heard that the name of the special tax is "excessive profit". Therefore, the inside story of the problem of raw silk coming to Shanghai is not simple. Even after paying the excessive profit "tax", it is still unknown whether raw silk can come to Shanghai. It is said that the shipment of raw silk must also have items such as a move-in certificate and a move-in fee. Therefore, both the source and outlet of the silk industry have become problems.

### Oilseed Cake: Oil Market First Tight, Then Weak

Yesterday's oil market, continuing the upward trend of the previous day, was still quite active with general quick-profit buying. Various quotations were pushed up by another yuan compared to the previous day, but actual sales still did not improve. A good situation was fatally hit. By the afternoon, due to lack of support, the situation suddenly changed, falling by one yuan and no one asking about it. The overall situation entered into a slump again. In the morning, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou peanut oil were traded at 69.50 yuan, 100 pieces of Yantai peanut oil were traded at 68.50 yuan, 1,000 tins of Jiangbei local oil were traded at 100 yuan, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded at 69 yuan, 50 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil were traded at 70 yuan, 100 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil were traded at 71 yuan, 70 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil were traded at 90 yuan to 98.50 yuan, 50 barrels of Pei Dong Factory soybean oil were traded at 75.50 yuan, 40 barrels of Taishan Factory soybean oil were traded at 75.67 yuan, and 200 dan of Da You Factory soybean oil were traded at 77.50 yuan to 78 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Domestic Sugar Stable

Yesterday's sugar market was affected by the exchange rate, which was first weak and then tight. Therefore, the public association's market also fluctuated accordingly. The spot price of 24 thick white sugar from foreign warehouses was 69 yuan to 68.90 yuan in the morning, and rose back by 30 cents to 69.10 yuan in the afternoon. The price of transshipment goods with warehouse receipts issued immediately was 54.80 yuan in the morning, and 55.40 yuan for delivery on July 2. The price of transshipment goods with warehouse receipts issued immediately rose to 55.20 yuan in the afternoon. Taikoo Vehicle White B Mark's new goods from the West warehouse were 81 yuan, the East warehouse was 80 yuan, and the Dutch red was 59.50 yuan. The price of Xuebai from this factory was 70 yuan. The trend of domestic sugar was stable, and transactions increased. Yesterday, 70 bags of Xinghua Sifting Green sugar were opened at 65 yuan, 143 bags of Xinghua Green sugar were opened at 64 yuan, and the final price was 62.50 yuan. 155 bags of Baibao Gao Diao Qing sugar were opened at 64 yuan, and dozens of bags of Haikou Yang sugar were opened at 63.50 yuan.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Longkou Vermicelli Falls 3 Yuan

The sales of thin vermicelli have been weak recently, and the price has fallen again. Yesterday, Longkou vermicelli was sold at 115 yuan, a drop of 3 yuan compared to before. Qingdao vermicelli was 90 yuan, and Yingshan Tang vermicelli was 45 or 46 yuan. However, the market supply of Jiangbei vermicelli is scarce, and there is no market price at present.

### Piece Goods: East Cloth Activity Rebounds

Yesterday the cloth market turned firmer. Although there was not much trading in the products of this factory, the industry inside and out actively made purchases due to the sharp drop in price of East piece goods. Fine cloth rebounded by more than 2 yuan per piece, and Serge rose by more than 4 cents per yard. The opening price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth in the morning was 28.78 yuan, and it was 29.60 yuan at noon. Later, the industry competed to cover short positions, and the bulls added more, and the market atmosphere was even stronger. The price of Longtou rose to 30.05 yuan, and the price of Four Gentlemen Serge rose to 8.35 yuan.

### Khaki Drill Fabric, Because of Chinese Factories

Yesterday, the market for khaki drill fabric saw standard price hold firm because the production of Chinese factories was limited and there was a lack of imported goods in stock. Meanwhile, the selection and designation for changing clothes continued, resulting in demand exceeding supply and active sales. Among the woven yarn goods, it has very much stood out above the crowd. Yesterday, British-made khaki drill was sold wholesale for 3.5 yuan per yard, East goods Elephant Deer brand was 2.6 yuan, Yih Ho Shen weave Toucan brand was 1.885 yuan, and the domestic Hongzhang brand was 1.6 yuan.

### Medicine: Smoked Plum Market Turns Dull

The source of smoked plums is not lacking, so the market inventory is full. The previous market had relatively smooth sales, and the highest price was over 41 or 42 yuan. As the customer appetite has been satisfied recently, the trend has turned soft. It is heard that there are more than 40 pieces of customer goods in the market, asking for 35 or 36 yuan, but there are few buyers. The price must fall by 5 or 6 yuan compared to the previous market.

### Hardware: Antimony Soars

The market for antimony (i.e., dull antimony) has recently seen scarce commodity due to blocked sources and limited inventory in the Shanghai market. The trading is still sluggish, but the market sentiment is still firm and high. Therefore, the standard market price has increased sharply by 300 or 400 yuan per ton compared to before.

### Rise in Foreign Lead Prices

Canadian foreign lead transactions: Yesterday's market saw transactions of thirty to forty dan (a unit of weight). It's noted that recently, due to the difficulty in importing Canadian lead and transportation obstructions, it's rumored that the current market's buying and selling relies solely on a small stock within this port. Therefore, those in the industry are optimistic, and the market price is currently selling at one hundred thirty yuan per dan.

Shen Bao Weekly Supplement, Issue 43

### The British National Character

Churchill said, "The Battle of France is over. The Battle of Britain is about to begin. I firmly believe that the men and women of the British Empire can cope with this severe test. The opportunity for everyone to demonstrate our nation's fighting power has arrived. If we fight and win, all conquered nations will be restored. If we fight and lose, the whole world will fall into a dark age again. We must cheer up, do our duty. If the British Empire continues for a thousand years, people will say 'This was the greatest period.'"

This is Churchill's battle cry to the British people. The outcome of this battle, militarily, will determine whether the British navy or the German air force and army are stronger; politically, it will determine whether democracy or dictatorship will lead Europe in the future. The Napoleonic Wars in history are about to be re-enacted, and whether there will be another Battle of Waterloo is temporarily unknown.

In 1806, Napoleon's territory included a large part of France, Germany, Italy, Austria, and Poland. After his navy was defeated in the Battle of Trafalgar, his army was still able to maintain itself on the European continent for ten years. In the end, the victory or defeat was still determined by the British naval power. At that time, Napoleon did not need to seek military supplies from overseas. The opposite is true of Hitler, but Napoleon did not have Hitler's air force. Naturally, he could not make use of his heroism in the British Isles. The current situation is different.

The British have a well-known poem that says:

All that we have been foretells our future;

The voice of Shakespeare, the hand of Nelson,

The faith of Milton, the weighty trust of Welles-Wells

This land of ours, endowed with freedom,

Let the world see: Though the whole world opposes,

What can they do to England?

This is the British belief. Whether this belief can still be shaken by the tide of the times is also temporarily unknown.

Speaking of this, the British national character naturally has a major impact on the future of the war. This journal will now translate the following records from the New York Times:

On the evening of the day of the Allied forces' defeat and retreat, a correspondent from the New York Times, while buying a newspaper from an old man on "Fleet Street" in London, asked him, "What's the news tonight?" The old news vendor replied, "I don't know. I never read the newspaper, because I know we will win in the end."

This fully demonstrates the British national character. They are always optimistic when encountering difficulties. Hitting a British person's head is like hammering a nail into the ground. The harder you hit, the more stable they become.

The national character of a country is best demonstrated during wartime. There is nothing unusual about that newspaper-selling old man.

In the first few battles of each decisive fight, the British seem like a tired and overly self-reliant old boxer, but after two or three stumbling swings, this boxer gradually shows his strength to win the championship.

The last war has proved that the British can withstand extraordinary blows from the enemy and still act as if nothing has happened. They have shown the world that even when the German army is approaching the English Channel and even when the British are starving, they can still rise up and fight back. The British have unlimited endurance and can bravely and happily fight in poorly equipped trenches. Now they still have the physical courage of that time.

At the beginning of the Norwegian campaign, Churchill said to the British people that Hitler's invasion of Scandinavia was the biggest military mistake since Napoleon's expedition to Spain. Three weeks later, the Germans drove the Allied forces out of the Arctic Circle, but the British were not discouraged at that time and have not been discouraged now.

The British way of rejecting troubles creates both strength and obvious weaknesses at the same time. The so-called strength is that because they refuse to worry, the British are stronger than any other nation in the world in their ability to endure hardship and their fearlessness of defeat, but at the same time, it is also a weakness, because sometimes they confuse contentment with self-confidence and misjudge their dangerous position for the sake of contentment.

This is only the case when newspapers and the public are patient with the government. When the country is in a critical situation, their transformation is also very rapid. This situation can be illustrated by what happened in early May. Since Chamberlain agreed to fully report the Norwegian campaign publicly, there has been no fierce rhetoric in the newspapers for several days. At this time, the British army withdrew from Northern Europe, and wounded soldiers began to be seen on the streets of London. These people brought the war closer to the British people, and when Chamberlain's speech failed to meet the expectations of the newspapers, they finally launched a major attack on him.

Judging from this experience, in addition to their calm appearance and quiet words, the British also contain the quality of clear anger. They have their own art of restraining themselves. This cultivation has been going on for a long time, so it is not easy to reveal the quality of anger; once it erupts, the power is somewhat terrifying.

At present, no matter where you go in the UK, it is difficult to hear the argument that the UK will be defeated. The British were surprised to see American newspapers discussing what would happen if Germany won. Some people even found it strange. They repeatedly said, "The British lose every battle, but they will win the last battle." They regard this as a guide to success and express joy.

The ability to cooperate is the first characteristic of the British. In private conversations and most casual interactions with people, the first impulse of the British is to cooperate. When you talk to him, he nods repeatedly out of his nature to show agreement. Sometimes, even if he completely opposes your meaning, he still expresses it this way.

The situation is similar in politics. For example, in any country in the world, which government gives the leader of the opposition a higher salary than ordinary members of parliament, because he is doing his best to subvert the government?

Coexisting with the nature of cooperation is the British's inherent honesty and the resulting trust in their companions. In wartime, self-reliance, cooperation, and trust are often the source of great strength. But in the past seven years, if these three aspects could have been handled more expediently, the war might have been avoided long ago, or the Allied forces would have been in a very advantageous position.

For example, the defeat of the Allied forces in Norway and on the Western Front, except for the Americans, may have greatly shaken their self-reliance and greatly weakened their combat power. Of course, the British still criticize the political situation in restaurants and tea houses; but because of some inertia in their reason, such as what they often say, "There's no need to make a fuss," and their very strong belief in final victory, and their nature of cooperating with any government in power, the British do not often take drastic measures in any event.

One fact can prove this point. Since the Allied forces withdrew from Norway, all the newspapers have advocated that the Allied forces must immediately increase the production of aircraft so that they can compete with the German army in the sky. This call was unanimously supported by the whole country, but all the major aircraft manufacturers, except for one, still stopped work and took holidays as usual during Whitsun.

To explain this kind of thing, one can only answer with British history. Because for nearly nine hundred years, invaders have never set foot on British territory. And because since the Battle of Trafalgar, for more than a hundred years, Britain has been safely behind the iron walls of the North Sea, and can really look down on the world. This kind of self-reliance has grown deeper and deeper and is firmly imprinted in their minds. In terms of instinct, the British cannot imagine the possibility of losing a battle.

In a time of national crisis, the actions led by national instinct may be better than those produced by reason. The most obvious characteristics of the British instinct or national character today--the nature of fair treatment, cooperation, trust, and self-satisfaction--were developed in an era when Britain had no external troubles, when the British navy dominated the world, and when global transportation was still developing slowly. But today, the British national character must be active in a new environment. What he is dealing with is a new and reckless enemy with new and rapid weapons, capable of challenging the powerful British navy. In this new environment, the British character cannot be used easily.

Here is another good example. At the beginning of the Norwegian campaign, a British reconnaissance plane spotted an airfield where the German army was flying soldiers to Norway. The airfield was located in Aalborg, Denmark. When this British airman was reconnoitering over the airfield, he found that the airfield was full of German transport planes. He immediately reported this to the peak. Because this airfield was located in the former neutral country of Denmark, the ministers discussed it for three days before finally allowing the British planes to bomb it, but several German planes had already flown to Norway with soldiers.

The British have a stiff temperament and do not need to be treated too well. There is also a characteristic that is deeply imprinted in their minds during the leisure years, which is an unparalleled sense of responsibility. The British generally see Britain as the protector of small and weak nations. Because of their love of freedom and justice, the British often regard themselves as defenders of justice. He is unwilling to meddle in other people's affairs unless he thinks it is necessary. He is also an individualist and does not want the state to interfere in his private life; but in times of crisis, all the state has to do is call on him loudly, and he will immediately agree to do it, and will not seek to understand why.

This kind of patriotism seems to be hidden in his bones. He has a deep historical concept and a blind belief in Britain's supreme destiny. He may not be interested in the phrase "The white race has a great responsibility", but like a small shareholder with one yuan of capital in a large company with 10,000 yuan of capital, he is proud of having this relationship and is eager to sacrifice himself for the country once the country is in trouble.

As a young American diplomat said, "The British need someone to run over and shout at them from a high place. This shout must have the power to inspire the past, present, and future. As long as there is a great leader, then manpower, courage, and material resources are ready, and victory can be guaranteed." The picture on the right shows Gibraltar, the throat of the Mediterranean.

### Hitler's Autopsy

— Jin Ge

Here is a man who excels in conquest, whose ambition surpasses Alexander the Great, Caesar, and Napoleon, who not only desires to conquer others but also seeks to transform the world through revolutionary means. This man is leading his great army, fiercely attacking the final obstacles. This man, who rose from the slums of Vienna, is about to become the master of hundreds of millions of people, the most powerful warlord of our time, Hitler. Whether this man will be regarded as a hero or a villain in history will depend on the success or failure of his military achievements.

Regardless of his success or failure, judging by his methods, Hitler's dreams are unprecedented in scale and thoroughness of totalitarianism. The complete realization of this kind of dream has exceeded the capabilities of a mere visionary and has become a concrete political program, backed by a military force that is unrivaled in the world. This man has a strong will, a keen mind, and a robust perseverance, bearing burdens that ordinary people cannot bear. His physical and mental energy is astonishing. But what kind of person is Hitler really?

It is never easy to explore anyone's soul and measure the complex motivations behind their actions, let alone someone as complex as Hitler. Hitler possesses a dual personality. One is the private Hitler, still bearing traces of his self-sufficient life in his hometown of Braunau am Inn in Austria. The other is the public Hitler, a dictator and warlord, whose position, unlike Mussolini's affectations, has become integrated into his life.

The private Hitler is short in stature and unremarkable in appearance, as ordinary as the people in the border region between Germany and the Czech Republic. His only distinguishing features are his short mustache and his small, blue-brown eyes, full of poetic introspection. In public, he is often shy and awkward, appearing ungraceful, with the air of "this insignificant little man."

For the sake of health, faith, and self-discipline, he is a vegetarian who abstains from alcohol and tobacco. He possesses the rustic character of the Alps but lacks the bearing of a German, clearly not from the ruling class.

The public Hitler, on the other hand, is a head of state, a mass orator, a dictator, and a warlord, completely different from the private Hitler. This transformation is often sudden and astonishing. This public Hitler is exuberant, highly self-confident, domineering, omniscient, and omnipotent, acting as if he is the only one of any importance. He does not talk, only gives speeches; he does not discuss, only issues orders; he does not walk, only rushes. His appearance changes dramatically, and he seems to grow taller. Therefore, those who have only seen Hitler in public are often surprised by his "short stature" when they meet him face to face. The public Hitler's face transforms into a hideous mask. His eyes stare intently, and his voice often rises from a calm, somber tone to a shrill pitch.

This Hitler is no longer a human being but a physical embodiment of an idea. Those who hate him are terrified, and those who love him are entranced. His personal bodyguards and paratrooper suicide squads are merely two groups of people captivated by his charisma. Hitler's extraordinary qualities are what give his speeches their enchanting power, and the general audience sometimes worships him as a god.

In addition, there is a third, secret Hitler, known only to his confidants. This Hitler, though his nerves are tormented by the contradictions between his dual personalities and the heavy burdens he bears, can quickly regain control and move forward as if nothing had happened.

Whether Hitler has ever loved any man or woman besides his mother is unknown. Whether he is loyal to anything other than his self-proclaimed mission is also unknown. In his book "Mein Kampf," apart from expressing love for his mother and his hometown in Austria, he fills the pages with words of criticism and rebellion, considering everything else unworthy of attention. The first person he rebelled against was his overly strict father, for whom he only expressed "respect" while opposing his father's attempt to force him into a narrow official career. He then hated the school regulations that prevented him from receiving a formal education. Hitler's father hated the fierce ethnic struggles between Pan-Germans and Czechs in the border region where he was born. Hitler's entire childhood was influenced by this struggle. His first political idea, nationalism within the National Socialist movement, was rooted in this. Later, the Vienna Academy of Arts' refusal to recognize Hitler's artistic talent also aroused his resentment.

Secondly, Hitler also despised the social, economic, and political systems that forced him to work as a construction worker and postcard painter, eking out a living in the slums of Vienna and Munich. He also hated the Marxists who forced him to join a labor union, which often left him unemployed. In these times of poverty and hardship, he hated everything about the status quo, such as the Habsburg monarchy of Austria, the parliamentary system, Marxism, and the Jews. This resentment grew over time, fostering a spirit of rebellion.

Four years after the end of the Great War, Hitler witnessed the collapse of Germany and was himself penniless. Personal humiliation and national grievances combined to fan the embers into a raging fire. At that time, Hitler was investigating political activities for the German military authorities. He happened to meet patriots and became interested, rising to give speeches to them and discovering that he was gifted in speaking and could sway people's hearts. His career as a political leader and the greatest revolutionary of all time began there.

What made Hitler stand out was certainly not just his eloquence. There were many others who sought to revive Germany, but only Hitler succeeded. The reason for this is that despising everything was a powerful driving force, but the inherited cunning, intuition, and sensitivity of generations of farmers, grasping the essentials and not being swayed by the environment, was also the secret to his success.

In short, Hitler's early life of hardship and his experience of social and national collapse fostered a sense of disgust, which was then developed into a revolutionary fervor. Having achieved something, he developed an unshakable belief in his own destiny and the mission he was charged to reform the world.

Hitler lived a simple life with a restrained diet. As the head of a major world power, he was still unable to find contentment, because Hitlerism had risen above Hitler himself. He was now bound by the movement he had created, and this movement was like a bicycle: it either moved forward or fell over. (Translated from The New York Times)

Children's Weekly

### A Few Words on the Summer Homework Competition

— Yu Yu

The purpose of this newspaper's summer homework competition is to encourage children's self-study spirit through competition and to arouse children's interest in self-study through rewards. Although the competition items are unable to include all primary school subjects, and are insufficient to substitute all the school's summer homework, it can at least be regarded as a new force to promote children's summer homework. It is hoped that all teachers will accept this humble intention of this newspaper, list this newspaper's homework topics into this year's summer homework, and earnestly guide the children to practice. All works should strive to preserve the true face of the children, because the purpose of participating in the competition is not to win awards, but to use the new factors that encourage children's homework to develop self-study habits. This is what I want to say to the teachers. Family and school must cooperate closely. During the summer vacation, children live in the family, and the responsibility of supervising summer homework undoubtedly falls on the parents. Arrange all the homework evenly throughout the entire vacation, and teach your children to go step by step. Pay attention to whether your children lack perseverance, and pay attention to whether your children are perfunctory and sloppy. Rather than using strict supervision, it is better to use positive encouragement. The result of strict supervision is often reluctance and perfunctoriness. Positive encouragement can make children excited and work hard. This is what I want to say to the parents.

Children, the homework that your teachers give you during the summer vacation is just as important as regular classes. You should respect the teachers' orders, use the cool mornings and evenings to schedule a self-study timetable, and manage yourself regardless of whether your parents supervise you. You must always earnestly study on your own, think thoroughly about the meaning, write neatly and cleanly, and draw correctly and beautifully. After completing each question, you must carefully review it, correct mistakes, and do your best to produce results that you think are satisfactory. If you want to win an award, please ask your older siblings to be hired guns. If you want to deceive others, you will first become a dishonest child. Isn't the word "dishonest" the most shameful term? Therefore, you must work hard on your own. This is what I want to say to the children.

### Spartan Children's Training

— Zheng Rong

The most famous city in ancient Greece was Sparta. In a certain period, Sparta was a very strong country, because there were brave and strong people in the country. Those brave and strong people were rigorously trained in their childhood.

The training that Spartan children received was somewhat excessive. It seems cruel now. When a child was born, he had to undergo a strict examination. If he was healthy, he was handed over to his parents to be raised. If he was sick or weak, he was thrown into the deep mountains to be starved to death or eaten alive by wild animals.

Therefore, only a group of healthy children grew into adults. However, when they reached the age of seven, the father had to leave the family and go to an educational institution to receive strict physical training. After this training, no one knew how to be lazy. They slept on reeds at night, which served as a soft bed, and wore only one robe throughout the year, which also served as a blanket at night.

Spartan children were completely trained to have the spirit of enduring pain and hardship, and never groaned in pain, because in their eyes, fear of pain was considered the most shameful thing. Sometimes, they were led by older children to travel, walking on rough and thorny roads. Although they all felt very tired and their feet were bleeding, they still endured it and said calmly with a smile; "I'm fine!"

Once, a young Spartan child stole a small fox from the mountains and played with it in the classroom. When the teacher came, he hid it in his clothes. At that time, the fox was extremely suffocated in the clothes! So he bit the child's chest, hoping to escape outside, but the child did not move at all, as if nothing had happened, letting it scratch and bite until it was bitten to death, and then he fell to the ground. At this time, his teacher discovered it and really praised the child's spirit of enduring pain. As for the Spartan girls, although they did not have as cruel training as the boys, they were all very healthy, and they also taught them to love the bravest boys and regarded it as a matter of pride. Therefore, the prosperity of Sparta was really based on their childhood.

It's the season of scorching summer again. The weather is so hot, and A Hui's school is about to end. So, these few days of big exams have already begun, and A Hui has to prepare her coursework for this semester properly.

A series of knocking sounds came from the kitchen, dispersing A Hui's mood for studying. It turned out that A Ming - her brother was nailing a large sheet of brand new tinplate to a large wooden box. "What is he doing?"

"Making a simple refrigerator." A Ming wiped the sweat from his head and replied.

"Homemade, it's not as good as buying one." A Hui wanted to stop her brother's work with this sentence, because the hitting sound was very harsh. It really disturbed her reading.

"Not necessarily, you know, this year, buying an ordinary refrigerator costs four or five times as much. Not to mention an electric refrigerator, which costs thousands of dollars, scaring the poor to death. Why don't we make use of waste and make our own? The effect is not bad either."

So A Ming started working again. A sheet of tinplate was wrapped outside the wooden box, and every crack inside the wooden box was carefully filled with putty. He also put a kerosene can in the middle of the wooden box, and pressed fine sawdust tightly around it, turning it into a double-layered box. The refrigerator was thus completed, but it cost very little, because these raw materials were available in A Hui's home.

### Shirley Temple's Autobiography (8)

— Min

Ke Gan, you come closer, let me whisper something in your ear. That day I went to test the camera lens was really the happiest day of my life. That time was really fun, it's a pity that I can't tell you the details carefully. I had never been to a movie company's studio before, and my mother had never been there either. Therefore, my mother and daughter were both very excited. My mother's excitement was because she didn't know what would happen when I tested the lens, and she didn't know if I would be so scared that I couldn't speak or be at a loss. As for my excitement, it wasn't because of this, only that the studio was very big and very magical. It was like a large cave with a very high ceiling and no windows, much bigger than the cave in the story of Aladdin's lamp and the cave in the story of Snow White. Just because it was too big, I didn't know where to start looking. On this day, there were other children in the studio watching, who had also come to test the lens. But we didn't pay attention to testing the lens, and we were always looking around the studio, running around, opening and closing the door, pushing this door, passing through the door, and jumping up and down on the chairs, like monkeys. We found hats everywhere, but wearing them on our heads didn't suit us. In addition, we saw all kinds of ropes scattered on the floor, and we didn't know what they were for. There were also many very big lights, shining very brightly. If you looked at them for a minute or two, you couldn't open your eyes.

Then the most interesting and fun things followed. Mr. Raymond and Mr. Hayes (his name was Jack, said to be a movie producer) called us all to take off our clothes. It turned out that what they wanted to shoot was a film called "Baby Burlesks," and all the roles were played by us children. They wanted us to take off our clothes and put on something like a diaper, fastened in front with a safety pin. Immediately, the mothers took off their children's clothes one after another according to the words of the two gentlemen, and I of course followed suit. Everyone ran around wearing that diaper-like thing.

First, it was my turn to try. I had to stand in front of the camera, smile slightly, blink my eyes, dance a dance, swing my shoulders two or three times, and say "Yes, I love!" Ke Gan, this sentence was said in French. Just think about it, the first time I tried the lens, I spoke French, which was really beyond my expectations. I heard them say that the first single film of "Baby Burlesks" was called "War Babies," and they asked me to play a small French dancer in a coffee shop, so I couldn't speak English, but had to speak French. Now Miss Buckland has taught me French, so I already know the meaning of this French sentence, but at that time I didn't know it at all. Mr. Raymond called me to say it like this, and I just imitated his voice. After the test was over, Mr. Raymond said to my mother: "In a few days, I will let you know the results of today's test of Shirley."

All the children who read my autobiography can know when they read here that trying a lens is as easy as making a cake. At that time, I didn't feel scared at all, I just felt that everything was good, and my nerves were not tense. Do you know who was nervous? It was my mother! After we went back, do you know who was nervous again? It was my father! I bet you will be surprised when you hear this, because the old man didn't want me to step into the movie industry before, so why would he care now? It turned out that he thought we would never have this opportunity, so he had made up his mind not to indulge in this delusion. Now that he heard that I had tried the lens, it was clear that it had become a reality, so he hoped that I would step into the movie industry, more earnestly than my mother.

### Children's Readings

— Ci Kai

Children, the summer vacation is coming soon. During the long period of two months, you may as well spend some time reading a few famous literary works. Everyone has probably heard of the following four names, but some children may not have read them yet, because reading them will greatly help with composition and aspirations. Therefore, I dare to solemnly introduce them to you during this summer vacation: Because they are good books, if you have already read them, you can still read them again.

*   "Education of Love" - Written in diary form, it tells the story of what happened in a primary school in Italy in one year, telling you how everyone should love each other and help each other, etc. You must use the translated version of Mr. Liang Qichao from the Kaiming Bookstore.
*   "Remi, Nobody's Boy" - It writes about a deserted child who has gone through many difficulties to find a family and live a happy life. The difficulties in the middle can make people feel touched and motivated. Use the translated version of Ms. Lin Xueqing from the Children's Bookstore.
*   "The Fifteen Boys" - It writes about fifteen children who untied the cables in the boat to play, were drifted to a desert island, and sought a living by themselves. It is very exciting to read. It is more interesting than "Gulliver's Travels" and "The Adventures of Pinocchio." Use the translated version of Mr. Liang Qichao from the World Bookstore, but unfortunately it is now out of print.
*   "Little Women" - It writes about a poor American family. The father is fighting on the front line, and the four daughters in the family have experienced many difficult circumstances in one year and have received many lessons in life. The plot is fluctuating and the description is extremely wonderful, and it gives readers instructions to work hard and move upward everywhere. Use Mr. Zheng Xiaocang's translated version. The author's bookstore may still have it for sale.

### The Yifeng Troupe's Future Plans

— A Han

In the promotion of the Peking opera improvement movement, the Yifeng Troupe, under the leadership of Zhou Xinfang, did shoulder its due mission. The plays "The Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty," "The Hatred of Concubine Xiang," and "The Two Emperors Huizong and Qinzong" have all won good reviews from public opinion. Although the performance of "Wen Suchen" emphasized the depiction of romantic love affairs, it still instilled correct ideas aimed at the current era in the interspersed scenes.

Recently, there has been a rumor that the Yifeng Troupe is about to disband. Under the surprise of the author, I felt that this was going to be true, but after inquiring in many ways, it was indeed not completely groundless.

It turns out that the Carlton Theatre is indeed suitable for performing plays in terms of architecture, but in hot weather, the space must rely on air conditioning to drive away the heat, so it has been opening air conditioning in previous years. However, this year, ice prices are surprisingly expensive, and it is estimated that the consumption per day will be as high as five or six hundred yuan, which is of course not worth the loss. Therefore, it was decided to start a summer break from the eighth of next month, and reopen after the autumn cools down.

However, the problem lies in the transitional period of the summer break, because since the performances are stopped, the theater will naturally be unable to pay the contracted fee. This makes it necessary for the big and small stars to seek other ways out. At the same time, if they once find a way out, they cannot just sing for two or three months and then come back to join. Therefore, after consultation between the two parties, they temporarily announced the dissolution in the name of the summer break.

Of course, Zhou Xinfang will never give up the Carlton's site, and his thinking is more advanced than that of ordinary Peking opera practitioners. Therefore, he is preparing to reorganize the Yifeng Troupe with all his energy after the autumn cools down. At the same time, at this important moment of the War of Resistance, he feels that he must work harder to perform dramas with healthy consciousness in order to encourage the people's morale and strengthen the people's hearts!

### From Song Halls to Peking Opera (Part 1)

Everyone knows that the main conditions for a combination to become a song are: first, the lyrics; second, the tune; and third, the rhythm. These two conditions are indispensable for any kind of song. Or you may think that yaoban can be free from the constraints of rhythm, but this is because you do not know the reason for the sharp insight. You must know that even slow boards and fast boards do not need to be bound by the rhythm, but they cannot be inconsistent with the rhythm. At the same time, although yaoban does not use clappers, there is a considerable degree of moderation between the fast and slow, which can be known by those who know it, and it is difficult for those with shallow knowledge to thoroughly understand it.

Regarding the compilation of lyrics, there is no doubt that Kunqu is the most elegant, followed by Min opera and Jingyin Dagu, then followed by storytelling and Suzhou Tanci, and then followed by Peking opera, which are just like birds of a feather. (The new private plays newly compiled by Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu are not included in this example.) Bangzi, Shen opera, and the like are even more vulgar. As for the accuracy of the pronunciation of words, Kunqu is also the most particular. The four tones have already been arranged for you when filling in the score, so no matter how beginner you are, if the tune is not correct, you cannot go to the flute, and if the tune is correct, the word will not be inverted. When learning, you only need to pay attention to the yin and yang, sharp and round, and fanqie for the words. Other operas are probably mostly local accents and few official accents. (This official accent can also be said to be the Zhongzhou rhyme.) Dagu almost completely uses local accents, so it is only suitable for people who understand the local area to be able to hear the interest. Only Peking opera purely adopts the Zhongzhou rhyme. Or you may say, I have seen many people who don't understand a word of foreign language, but they like to watch movies. How can they hear the interest? It is very difficult for me to answer at once, but it can be decided that their purpose is definitely not to specifically listen to the words or listen to the songs, at least it always contains a large part of the meaning of watching the plot and scenery, so people who do not understand foreign languages ​​should say to watch a movie or watch a movie, and cannot say to listen to a movie. Originally, the saying to listen to a movie is only a northern dialect, and southerners usually say to watch a shadow play (to be continued)

### Movie Advertisements to be Inspected

The Public Concession Film Inspection Committee will implement the inspection of film advertisements. The advertising sentences of each company's new films must be submitted in the original manuscript for inspection, and can only be published after passing. The motive for this move is that the film advertisements in a certain period mostly contain lustful sentences, which are quite suspected of being obscene.

Hawthorne's Case

### The Ownership of the Dancing Queen

— By Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Two: "A Page of Past History!"

"This—this is difficult for me to say. They are not considered anything in name—but they are still friends after all."

Hawthorne nodded slightly, but a trace of a smile appeared at the corner of his lips. This smile clearly deepened the old gentleman's embarrassment. The old man looked at his deceased niece and shook his head.

He continued, "Mr. Hawthorne, you must know that such friends are not within the five relationships that we have respected for thousands of years. I extremely disapprove of it. But Lilan is older, and after all, she is not my own daughter, how can I control her?"

Hawthorne sighed softly, offering a comforting sound, "Of course, you can't be blamed for that. In fact, in this Shanghai area, this kind of so-called friend has long been widely recognized as the sixth relationship!"

Li Zhiban shook his head repeatedly and sighed, "Abandoned and extravagant, doing everything for oneself!"... Shanghai is truly a place of all evils! But in my old-fashioned mind, it is still a bit shameful to talk about such friends."

Hawthorne glanced at him and nodded, "Mr. Li, you are truly a virtuous and upright gentleman... Apart from this Lu Jiansheng, were there any other 'friends' who provided for her?"

"I'm not sure about that. But she certainly had a lot of friends."

"In that case, you wouldn't know if she had any other income, would you?"

"I don't know. I rarely come here, and now I am very polite to her, so of course I can't easily inquire about her."

"Indeed. So, among her many friends, how many do you know?"

Li Zhiban hesitated again and said, "I can't say much about this either. The day I arrived in Shanghai, I saw two young men in Western suits arguing with Lilan here. One was younger, said to be named Yu. The other was taller, and he has been coming in and out of here these past few days, but I don't know his name."

Hawthorne stood up, walked to the desk, and pulled open the drawer, taking out the several male photographs he had just discovered. Li Zhiban followed Hawthorne as he approached the desk. As soon as he saw the contents of the drawer, he seemed to be stunned.

### Twenty Kinds of Storytelling Songs (Twelve Kinds) The Romance of the Western Chamber

— Written by Dongyun, Crafted by Xiuyan

The Romance of the Western Chamber, a Yuan dynasty drama; written by Wang Shifu, based on Tang dynasty's Dao Zhen's "Story of Yingying." Although it is also a story of talented scholars and beautiful women, the descriptive technique in Romance of the Western Chamber, is refined and elegant, precisely as it should be; evidently superior to ordinary storytelling novels.

Among storytellers skilled in performing The Romance of the Western Chamber, there are Zhu Lan'an (deceased), Huang Yi'an, and He Keren. Lan'an is "elegant", Yi'an is "humorous", and Keren is "steady and practiced", each with their own unique strengths. However, no one has been able to fully capture the "charm" of Yingying, the "cleverness" of Hongniang, or the "literary talent and elegance" of Zhang Sheng.
