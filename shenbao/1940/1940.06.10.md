### Fierce Battles Unfold on the West Bank of the Han River; Chinese Troops Complete Encirclement of Japanese Forces; Battle Line Shifts Near Jingzhou and Shashi as Chinese Prepare for Subsequent Developments; Japanese Troops Invading Westward Controlled on All Fronts After Fierce Fighting

Yichang:  The true face of the battle on the west bank of the Xiang River has gradually unfolded in an environment of extreme Chinese military superiority.  Japanese troops concentrated near Jingmen and Shili Pu, ten miles south of Jingmen, began an offensive to the west at dawn on the 9th.  Fierce battles erupted everywhere from Guanyin Temple (northwest of Jingmen) and Yuxi River to the Qian area on the south side of Herong Town (both southwest of Jingmen). By noon, all the Japanese troops in the Qian area had been suppressed by the fierce Chinese artillery fire, with casualties mounting and their morale greatly diminished.  Although the Japanese continuously employed numerous aircraft to assist in their fierce attacks, they were unable to advance an inch. (9th dispatch)

Gongan:  Japanese troops who crossed the Xiang River westward from the Duobaowan and Sigangshi areas on the 5th were intercepted and flanked by Chinese forces at every turn near Benghu Town, Xinhe Town, Hougang Town, Shi Huiqiao Pu, and Sifang Pu (all northeast of Jiangling).  The fighting lasted continuously for three days and nights, repeatedly blunting the Japanese advance.  By the morning of the 8th, the Japanese forces near Sifang Pu joined forces with the Japanese troops moving south, dividing their forces to attack Jiangling and Shashi fiercely.  A certain Chinese unit carried out a mobile interception in the Mashiqiao Ersheng Temple area (both northeast of Jiangling).  By nightfall, the battle line had gradually shifted near Jingzhou and Shashi.  The Chinese military is now preparing for subsequent developments with all its strength, and has, according to plan, moved into the vast lake and marsh area southeast of Jingzhou and Shashi, exposing the flanks and rear of the Japanese troops advancing westward to the Chinese forces.  The Japanese troops are increasingly trapped in an irredeemable predicament. (9th dispatch)

Chongqing:  According to a spokesman for the Chinese army, while dozens of Japanese aircraft bombed Xuan Chang yesterday and the day before, yesterday the Chinese army completed the encirclement of a large number of Japanese troops on the west bank of the Han River.  At this time, the Japanese guns are clearly aimed at Yichang.  Japanese aircraft bombed Yichang in formations of two or three, in several waves over the past two days.  Six people were killed in the air raids, and many were injured.  During Saturday's air raid, a bomb landed near British property in the city.  The spokesman also said that the Chinese army in Hubei is not only defending Yichang, but is also using a large-scale encirclement to annihilate the main force of the Japanese army on the west bank of the Han River. (9th dispatch from the Associated Press)

Chongqing:  According to today's Central Hubei dispatch, the fighting is extremely fierce along the fifty-mile stretch of the Han River front line from Qianjiang to Jiukou.  The Japanese side is using heavy artillery fire to bombard the Chinese army positions on the west bank of the Han River to cover their troops' operations.  Yesterday, the Chinese artillery also fiercely bombarded the Japanese army positions on the east bank of the Han River opposite Shayang.  The fierce battle did not stop all day yesterday.  The Chinese military's objective is to capture several important strongholds in order to cut off the Japanese army's rear. (9th dispatch from the Associated Press)

Chongqing:  A Chinese military spokesman stated today that the Chinese side is confident that the Chinese army is not only capable of holding Yichang to resist the Japanese army currently attacking upstream, but will also eventually encircle and annihilate the Japanese army that has crossed the Han River.

(9th dispatch from Reuters)

Yichang:  For days, the Chinese army has been fighting the Japanese for control of the various crossings in the lower reaches of the Xiang River.  In the areas both north and south of Shayang, the fighting with the Japanese is extremely fierce.  The remaining Japanese troops on the west bank have been almost completely wiped out.  On the afternoon of the 7th, Japanese naval vessels arriving from the lower reaches to reinforce their forces launched a counterattack, but were strongly suppressed by the Chinese forces and failed to achieve their aim.  On the eastern front, a large number of Japanese boats arrived to reinforce their forces and cover the Japanese troops' landing and counterattack, which again led to a bloody battle with the Chinese forces.  The Chinese army occupied favorable terrain and unleashed intense firepower, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese.  At the same time, the Chinese army on the opposite banks of Duobaowan, Sigangshi, Zhangjiegang, and other places also fiercely attacked Japanese boats and ships operating on the water.  More than ten Japanese motorboats and four small steamers towing Japanese soldiers and military supplies such as ammunition, as well as more than twenty civilian boats that they were towing, have been sunk by the Chinese forces one after another.  The surface of the Xiang River is full of Japanese corpses, all floating downstream.  The Chinese army is now advancing eastward along the river, deeply intercepting key passes in the lower reaches.

Editorial

### Analysis of the Japanese Political Situation

The Japanese Prime Minister, Yonai, explained the current cabinet's foreign policy to reporters, stating that the China Incident would continue to proceed according to the planned procedure, and that the policy of non-participation in the European War would remain unchanged, with no new insights offered.  However, his words implicitly expressed dissatisfaction with the impatience and clamor of some so-called "reformist" elements in Japan.  This statement by Yonai, on the surface, is merely a reaffirmation of the current cabinet's consistent policy of maintaining the status quo.  However, the recent complexity of Japanese political opinions and the turmoil in the political situation can also be easily gleaned from this.

Since the "May 15th" incident, Japanese politics have long deviated from constitutional norms.  Political parties have retreated behind the scenes, and the military-fascist forces control everything in the political arena. The military is a supreme cabinet, and the so-called reformist politicians are sycophants, fanning the flames and colluding with each other. This phenomenon has persisted for several years, right up to the present.  The conservative forces opposed to the military, while outwardly having to allow military fascism to run rampant, are not actually willing to retreat. They are constantly seizing opportunities, preparing to take advantage of any flaws to restore their political weight. This struggle has been the main theme of political turmoil in Japan for several years, and has also formed the main cause of instability in its political situation.  Of course, this is only a contradiction within the Japanese ruling class, which has greatly weakened the internal solidarity of Japan and made it impossible to achieve political stability even during wartime.  In general, however, this internal contradiction does not affect the consistency of its aggressive stance.  During the "September 18th" incident, the side effects of Japan's external aggression often promoted a political strategy of internal solidarity.  But recently, this political strategy has come to a dead end with the protracted and unsuccessful invasion of China.  The war of aggression is no longer enough to stimulate the emotions of its people, nor can it be used to ease internal conflicts. The unprecedented suffering of prolonged warfare has enveloped the country. The exhaustion of national finances, the decline of industry and commerce, and the withering of people's lives have all deepened and expanded the already latent social crisis.  These phenomena, reflected in the political arena, have led to a gradual decline in the military's prestige and the attempted rise of the conservative camp.  The Yonai cabinet was born under these circumstances.  The failure of the war of aggression against China, the capitulation to provocation against the Soviet Union, the abandonment of the German-Italian line, and the inability to break the external deadlock are all major reasons for the decline of the Japanese military-fascist forces.  Although the Yonai cabinet came into being under these circumstances, it cannot offer better solutions to the many difficulties inherited from the fallen Hiranuma and Abe eras.  At best, it can only try its best to maintain the status quo, with the ability to continue the policies of the previous cabinets.  As a result, conservative elements and the general public are bound to be disappointed, while the reformist elements gradually express impatience.  Recently, the European war situation has been expanding daily, and Nazi military forces have achieved initial victories. The Japanese political situation has become more turbulent due to this external stimulus, as exemplified by the New Party Movement.  Kuhara's proposal all indicate that the fascist camp has begun to advance a new offensive.  This is by no means something that can be dispelled by Yonai's policy report, which is a mere repetition of old ideas.  Although the military's attitude has remained silent so far, it has tested the conservative forces in the past with the Asama Maru problem and the Saito incident. The recent replacement of the Minister of the Imperial Household by Kido is undoubtedly also the result of indirect military pressure.  So far, only a few reformist politicians have stirred up trouble. Once it reaches a certain stage, the military may directly intervene, as it did in the past when it overthrew the Abe cabinet.

These various fluctuations, subjectively intended to promote political stability, have objectively become the main current in the instability of the political situation, increasing Japanese political unease, but it is difficult to achieve any results. For three years, many reform plans have been implemented in Japan internally, but have they reduced their own difficulties in the slightest? So-called measures such as reforming the political structure and establishing national unity might have had some influence if they had been proposed at the beginning of the war. Now, the Japanese government and public have long lost confidence in the war of aggression against China, and the will of the people and soldiers has been disrupted by slogans such as "peace" and "settling the incident." Reform plans proposed at this time only expose the decorations in the face of helplessness.  The current suffering of Japan is a fact. Whether it is the chaebol who are in charge of the aggression or the people who only seek to live, everyone is unusually impatient and feels that the future is unusually difficult and bleak.  Among the Japanese government and public, there are of course those who are relatively enlightened and recognize that the war of aggression against China is the root cause of all current problems, but absolutely no one possesses the qualifications to call upon, the courage to expose, and even less the power to seek a solution. The Japanese authorities are constantly preparing to end the China Incident, but in reality, the measures taken are only to prolong and complicate the "incident" further. Even knowing that it will be prolonged and complicated, they still have to constantly prepare to end the China Incident, using self-deception to muddle through, as exemplified by the China policy that Yonai talked about the other day. The so-called reformist elements are indeed acting perversely and recklessly, and even in the conservative camp, isn't there a lack of a sense of direction? They are all equally willing to accept the dictates of fate, and there is no fundamental difference between them.  Japan's failure today has reached a very serious stage in military, economic, and diplomatic terms, but its rulers have always lacked a far-sighted vision and understanding. Their only action is internal infighting, vying for control of the regime.  Given this situation, whether the Japanese political situation will see a further rise of military fascism or the conservative camp clinging to the old ways, what they yearn for is nothing more than to expect some loophole in the international changes to provide them with a chance for luck. The inevitable final outcome is that they will eventually collapse in the rapidly evolving international situation.

### German Main Force Continues Fierce Attack, Advances Towards Seine River Basin; Fierce Fighting Also Occurs South of Aisne River; Front Extends from Coast to Argonne Region

Paris: The General Headquarters has just released a war bulletin stating that the frontline battles remain extremely fierce. In recent days, the front has continued to expand eastward, reaching the vicinity of Argonne. Starting at dawn today, the enemy launched another fierce offensive along the line from Château-Porcien to Chesne-Popiel. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)

Paris: The General Headquarters has just released a war bulletin stating, "From the coastal area to the 'Avenue de la Dame' line, fierce battles raged throughout the day and have not yet ceased. (1) West of the Oise River, the enemy is intensifying pressure on our positions in the lower reaches of the L'Aisne River, and is concentrating a large number of troops between Aumale and Noyon, launching a full-scale offensive. The enemy's infantry units, newly transferred from the rear to the front line, immediately launched successive attacks under the cover of intense artillery fire, finally breaking into our positions. In total, the enemy force consists of more than twenty fresh divisions, supplemented by seven tank divisions, far outnumbering our forces. Due to the vast disparity in strength, our army was unable to stop the enemy's advance and was forced to retreat. However, the enemy suffered extremely heavy losses. (2) The pressure exerted by the enemy on the east side of the Oise River has also increased, and a large number of reinforcements have arrived to assist in the battle (including a large number of tank units), giving them a boost in momentum, and they have gained strongholds on the high ground south of the Aisne River. Our army is adopting a steady, step-by-step strategy, and will not lightly abandon an inch of territory. In the final decisive engagement, our artillery destroyed thirty-six German tanks, including one of our companies that destroyed nineteen German tanks single-handedly. Another artillery unit, firing at enemy tanks at a short distance of 100 meters, destroyed seventeen tanks in one fell swoop. (3) Our air force was still very active today, continuing to fly to the front lines, disrupting enemy troops, and using machine guns to strafe tank units. Later, they flew to the occupied areas recently captured by the enemy and dropped bombs. Their supply trains that were being transported were also dispersed by our aircraft. In addition, more than 150 of our bombers flew to the front lines this morning under the protection of British and French fighter planes, bombing enemy concentration points. One team even flew to the outskirts of Berlin last night and bombed German factories, all of which safely returned to their bases afterward." (Havas Agency Dispatch, 8th)

German Offensive Unprecedentedly Fierce; French Front Retreats Again

Paris: Military sources here recently stated that the frontline battles are intensifying and have reached their peak today. The German army is pouring all its strength between the L'Aisne River and the Oise River, launching a fierce attack on the French positions, the scale of which is unprecedented in history. This route is only 150 kilometers long, but the German forces launching the offensive consist of 4,000 tanks and 500,000 infantrymen. The general offensive began at dawn today, with soldiers advancing shoulder to shoulder and in close formation under the intense fire of French machine guns and artillery. South of Amiens and in the direction of Roye, the French army was ordered to retreat last night. The German army took advantage of this to advance, approaching the new positions held by the French army between Aumale and Noyon (that is, between the left bank of the L'Aisne River and the right bank of the Oise River), and encountered strong resistance. French machine gun teams immediately swept the onrushing "human wave," causing heavy casualties to the Germans. At the same time, British and French aircraft attacked German infantry and tank units with machine guns and bombs at an altitude of 70 feet, with considerable success. Although the French troops were vastly outnumbered by the Germans, they still launched surprising attacks in the "no-man's land," repeatedly counterattacking, and finally turned the tide of the positions they held. By evening, the German army launched another large-scale offensive, and the French army, unable to resist, finally ordered an orderly retreat. Although the German army made some progress in this battle, it did not break through the French positions. The German army launched similar offensives in other places as well, such as the advance in the Aisne River basin, which was roughly the same as the battles in the L'Aisne River and Oise River areas. In some places, they have advanced to the banks of the Aisne River, and even built pontoon bridges by evening, intending to cross by force. However, the French army immediately launched a fierce counterattack, repelling the German army to the west of Soissons. The situation east of the city was the same as the previous day. After the German tank units reached the outskirts of Foreste (the town is 40 kilometers northeast of Rouen), the French army immediately launched a large-scale counterattack, assisted by the air force, which was quite effective. In addition, the area is crisscrossed by rivers and adjacent to the forests of Normandy, which is unfavorable for tank activity. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)

Paris: Military sources here recently stated that today was one of the most critical days of the frontline battles. The German side is fighting with all its strength, sparing no expense, in an attempt to achieve a decisive victory. The total strength, estimated to be between ninety and one hundred divisions, is launching a fierce attack on the French positions from the coast to the Argonne region. About forty divisions are on the line from the coast to the Oise River, about ten divisions are attacking the Aisne River near Soissons, and about forty divisions are in the upper reaches of the Aisne River and near Champagne. As for the results of yesterday's war, the German gains were limited, and the losses outweighed the gains. On the Somme front, after two days of fighting, due to excessive casualties, they had to transfer the second batch of reserves to the front line to fight. In short, judging from yesterday's battle situation, the German army launched a fierce southward offensive south of Amiens. By evening, the battle had moved to the D'Artois area, but the advance of the enemy's infantry was at most only ten to fifteen kilometers. In addition, in the upper reaches of the Aisne River, the German army launched a new offensive on a 40-kilometer front between Château-Porcien (10 kilometers west of Rethel) and Chesne-Popiel (located along the Aisne River to the Meuse River canal). The tank units that had advanced to the vicinity of Foreste on the 7th of this month suffered extremely heavy losses after a fierce French counterattack, and only a small number of troops made some progress in the southwest. (Havas Agency Dispatch, 9th)

Paris: Last night, the French military announced that the German army had gained a strong foothold on the high ground south of the Aisne River, while the French army was defending the foothills of the high ground. A spokesman for the Ministry of War stated that the German army "has completed a bridgehead on the south bank of the Aisne River, and the French army was forced to make a strategic retreat in the Aumale and Noyon areas." He added that fresh French troops had been sent to Foreste to resist the advance of 300 German tanks. The 300 German tanks had penetrated halfway between the Somme River and the Seine River, but were besieged yesterday. The French army bombed the isolated German tank units with aircraft and artillery, while preventing German infantry from crossing the L'Aisne Valley to rescue the tank units. The distance between the tanks was 75 yards. The French Ministry of War reported that the German General Staff had exhausted all its reserves in the campaign in northern France, but the German side had not achieved any definite results "despite heavy sacrifices in manpower and materials," except for the tank attack in an area called Notredame east of the Seine River. Yesterday, the terrible German offensives were blocked by the entire French front. General Weygand's strategy has not changed. Every defensive position from the seaside to the "Avenue de la Dame" that has been shelled is firmly defended by the French army. At dusk last night, the front lines extended from the coast to the interior through the L'Aisne Valley and the mountainous area of Ham on the Somme River, and from there through the forest plateau northwest of Soissons to both banks of the Aisne River east of Soissons. The 300 German tanks that broke through Normandy yesterday seemed to be advancing down the Seine Valley, where the important cities of Rouen and Le Havre are located. The natural defenses of the lower Seine are very well developed. The river between Rouen and Le Havre is full of important factories, oil refineries, and large oil pools, all owned by the American Petroleum Company. (United Press Dispatch, 9th)

German Army Assembles Enormous Forces; Rear Supply Lines Threatened

Paris: Officials here recently stated that the German army's fierce offensive in northern France in recent days was intended to inflict a fatal blow on the French army and force the French army to engage in a decisive battle at a time and place designated by the German General Staff. However, the French command has already seen through their plan and has taken the initiative to retreat to avoid their sharp edge, and the German army's battle plan has not been realized. In total, the number of infantry mobilized in this decision was no less than 500,000, and the number of tanks was no less than 4,000, while the frontline of their operations was only 145 kilometers. With such a narrow frontline, such a large force was used, and their desire to make a desperate gamble and achieve a quick victory is self-evident. What is more, after crossing the Somme River yesterday, the German army shortened the battlefront again and avoided attacking the Lys River, because the Lys River basin is mostly marshland, and the German army did not dare to advance rashly. Currently, the German army's rear supply lines have become an arc. The German supply train must pass through this narrow corridor to reach the front, but the British air force base is on its left, and the French army and air force base is on its right. Under this double-sided attack, the German army's supply route is under tremendous threat. As far as the French army's battle strategy is concerned, although it is inevitable to suffer some losses when resisting the German army's large-scale offensive, the heavy losses of the German army cannot be compared to it. In addition, because the French army is good at avoiding the enemy's attacks, its strength remains intact when retreating to new positions, and it can wait at ease for the German army to lose its elite and penetrate deeply before inflicting a painful blow. In a nutshell, the goal of the German army's large-scale offensive has not been achieved. Although it has made some progress in recent days, the losses have been heavy, and the gains do not outweigh the losses. What is more, the French army has the possibility of taking the initiative in the future. Although it is difficult to predict when the defense will be turned into an offense, once the opportunity is ripe, the Allied Commander-in-Chief General Weygand will be able to make a decisive decision and launch an attack. This can be asserted. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)

French Analysis of the War Situation; German Offensive Strength Declines

Paris: Last night, the French government released a battle analysis report stating that the number of German tanks and aircraft has been sharply reduced after several days of fierce fighting. According to other official documents, if Britain and France continue to actively produce them, and with the continuous supply from the United States, the air power of Britain and France will be able to match Germany by mid-July. This French report believes that if the number of aircraft in Britain and France is equal to that of Germany, the British and French air forces will definitely have an advantage, because even if the number of aircraft is very scarce at present, they often win in air combat. It can be seen that the skills of British and French airmen are very good. With excellent airmen and a large number of aircraft, the power of the air force is enough to surpass it. There is no need to mention it. Now Germany is suffering heavy material losses from time to time. The number of tanks lost every day is often between 200 and 400, and the number of aircraft lost every day is between 40 and 60. It is said that the German tanks and aircraft destroyed by France in the past few days were all driven directly from the armory to the battlefield. From this, it can be seen that Germany has no surplus in the country. In the eight months since the German invasion of Poland, the German armory spent a lot of effort to replenish the tanks and armored vehicles destroyed by the Polish army, and only after replenishing the losses did it exceed the original amount. When Germany began its invasion of Belgium, according to French official estimates, there were a total of 5,000 tanks and armored vehicles, but half of them have been destroyed or out of use. Later, Germany took a large number of tanks from the Netherlands and Belgium, which enabled it to enter the Somme battlefield with 3,000 to 4,000 tanks. It is said that 2,000 of them were driven out to fight on the second day of the Somme War. The French report continued that after 600 tanks were destroyed, the German army responded with an equal number of new tanks. Now there are still 2,000 German tanks in operation, and some of them have penetrated 15 miles behind the French lines. Germany may have no surplus left in the country. (United Press Dispatch, 9th)

Weygand Declares to the Frontline Soldiers to Firmly Defend Their Positions and Not Give Up

Paris: Allied Commander-in-Chief General Weygand has just issued a letter to the frontline soldiers today, which roughly stated, "The enemy is launching an offensive on the entire front from the coast to the Montmédy area, and the war will extend to the border of Switzerland. The frontline soldiers, no matter where they are stationed, should firmly defend their positions, look ahead, and not give up. The bravery of our army and air force units in combat is exemplary and is known to the Commander-in-Chief. Not only do I express my gratitude, but France is also grateful. My soldiers, the safety of the motherland not only requires your bravery, but also requires your full determination to launch and fight. I know you will be able to do the job well. The enemy has suffered heavy losses and will see its strength decline again and again. We have now reached the last quarter of an hour. You must all persevere to the end." (Havas Dispatch, 9th)

German War Bulletin

Berlin: Yesterday's German war bulletin still does not publish the names of towns and cities, in order to avoid revealing signs of the nature and objectives of the new offensive. The war bulletin issued by the German army during the Frankish War also took a silent attitude, but it can be asserted that the German army has broken through the "Weygand Line" and continues to advance. The German air force is also actively assisting in the battle. The scope of activities in recent days has been to bomb the enemy's rear supply lines. German aircraft also bombed the Narvik area. The number of prisoners captured near Dunkirk has increased to 88,000, almost all of whom are from the army, which proves that the rear work of the British Expeditionary Force is undertaken by the French army. (Haitong Dispatch, 9th)

German Leader's Camp: This afternoon, the German war bulletin stated that in the past four days, German infantry, tank units, and the air force have cooperated very well in the Somme and Oise regions, defeating the strong enemy forces and fresh troops. The German army has penetrated deep into the French defense line in the lower Seine River and captured a lot of supplies. German aircraft bombed the enemy's artillery and anti-aircraft artillery positions, and dispersed the enemy's concentrated forces and tank units. The German army took advantage of the victory to pursue eastward and has crossed the Aisne River. German aircraft bombed the airfields in Cherbourg and north and southeast of Paris, and bombed the railways and highways northwest of Paris. The Allies lost a total of 58 aircraft yesterday, of which 39 were destroyed in air combat, 13 were shot down by anti-aircraft artillery, and the rest were aircraft parked on the ground. German aircraft only had one aircraft missing. Two German warships (Gneisenau and Scharnhorst), under the command of Marshal Ma Xia'er, broke through the siege. When the two ships were in the Arctic Ocean, they destroyed the British aircraft carrier "Glorious" and a destroyer.

### Italy's Posturing to Participate in the War Still Awaits; Roman Newspapers Arbitrarily Attack Britain and France; Saying Italy's Patience is Limited

Rome: Ansaldu today delivered a speech to the Italian army on the radio, saying that although the timing of Italy's participation in the war is still a secret of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, Italy during this second stage of the war should take Britain as our enemy. Italy has an important responsibility for the development of the situation. Italy should join hands with Germany to fight against Britain, and at the same time fight for Italy's independence in the Mediterranean. Italy appointed General Ba as the commander of the Southern Army, which is of great significance. France will not be able to resist the German offensive in the short term. The fall of Paris and the retreat to the third line of defense is equivalent to France's suicide. Once France collapses, we will begin to fight the main enemy, Britain, head-on. Now that Britain is under this threat, it will no longer send troops and munitions to France. (Haitong Dispatch, 6th)

Rome: Italian newspapers continued to attack Britain and France yesterday, saying that Italy can no longer tolerate it and will fight Britain and France to the death.

The European democracies that despise Italy must be attacked. Italy will fight the wealthy politicians of London and Paris to the death."

(United Press Dispatch, Day)

Rome: Italian reporter Gai Da published an article in "Italian News" stating that the purpose of Britain and France is to destroy Italy.

Britain and France have even taken aggressive measures in the Adriatic Sea, threatening direct traffic between Italy and Albania. However, Italy will not tolerate this forever and will rise up to defend the country's freedom and the right to life. (Haitong Dispatch, 9th)

### Japanese Authorities Crack Down on Extravagant Lifestyles; Indulgence in Sensual Pleasures Among Those Prohibited

Therefore, female staff and hostesses are all required to wear more dignified clothing. Dancing is also prohibited in these venues. Restaurants, cafes, bars, and secret clubs must all close at 10 pm every night to prevent revelers from wasting their money and time. The construction of such entertainment venues is also prohibited.

### Japan's Policy Remains Unchanged; US-Japan Relations Difficult to Improve; Statement by Undersecretary Welles

Washington – Yesterday, US Undersecretary of State Welles neither formally welcomed nor expressed dislike for the suggestion that the US and Japan should resolve the disputes in the Pacific so that both countries can concentrate on protecting their borders. Welles answered questions from reporters about mediating US-Japan relations and maintaining the status quo in East Asia within the realm of possibility, using gentle diplomatic language. When reporters asked Welles to express his opinion on suggestions that steps should be taken now to improve US-Japan relations, Welles replied that the US is always willing to improve relations with any country, but based on the US's policy towards other countries. The US and Japan often hold talks on the issue of China, such as protecting the interests of US citizens, but have not started any special new talks. "We always hope to improve US-Japan relations." Lippmann, a special writer for a certain newspaper, argued that the US should adjust its relationship with Japan because it is concerned about the situation in Europe. If the US is drawn into the whirlpool of the European war, it is clear that it wants to stabilize the situation in the Pacific, and Japan will end the Sino-Japanese war as soon as possible by restoring its economic power. Informed sources here predict that Japan may use the diplomatic balance of power to prevent the Axis powers from winning in order to avoid the Soviet Union and Germany cooperating to pressure Japan to return the German mandated islands and the rights of the Germans in Shandong after the British fleet is captured by Germany. But, fair sources claim, the US will not change its policy towards China or conclude contracts that hinder China's economic power, even if that idea expands, it will still take time before formal action is taken.

### Chinese Spokesman Makes Solemn Statement; No Word of Any Peace Proposals; No Peace Between China and Japan Until Japanese Troops Withdraw From Chinese Territory

Chongqing – Military Commission Spokesman Discusses Weekly War Situation (June 2 to 8). After the defeat in Hunan and Hubei, they gathered the remnants and invaded the west bank of the Xiang River. Although they have reached a crowd of 30,000, they will inevitably be completely destroyed in front of the strong wall of China. It is worth mentioning the following important battle results:

Henan-Hubei

The Chinese army continued the war results of last week and advanced on the remnants of the Japanese army near Zhaoyang by multiple routes, clearing places such as Huyang Town, Taiping Town, and Yangjiadang. Then they attacked Zhaoyang with fierce charges. The remnants of the Japanese army fled in multiple routes. The Chinese army recovered Zhaoyang on the 2nd and is now pursuing the victory.

In order to cover up the crushing defeat, the Japanese army crossed the river between Yicheng and Xiangyang on the evening of May 31 and invaded Xiangyang, Yicheng, and Nanzhang in multiple routes. After the Chinese army fought bravely, Xiangyang was immediately recovered. The Japanese who attacked Nanzhang were also forced to retreat to the southeast. The Chinese army pursued fiercely, killing many Japanese troops. Now the Japanese army that has crossed the river has reached more than 30,000. Seeing the fierce attacks by the Chinese army in recent days, the morale of the Japanese army is declining and will inevitably suffer another great defeat. At the same time, the Chinese armies on all routes are majestic and strong, which is enough to fundamentally shake the Japanese base on the Han River.

Guangdong-Guangxi

After the Japanese army invading northern and southern Guangdong strengthened their reinforcements and counterattacked last week, the Chinese army lured the Japanese reinforcements to the mountainous areas of Niubeiji and Liangkou in the northwest in order to annihilate them. Starting from the 1st, the Chinese army formed an encirclement and implemented a scissors-shaped tactic, attacking in multiple routes, and successively recovered Dongdong, Yayi Mountain, Meirongding, Baiwuhu, Erjiadong, Cudongwei, Fenshuiao, Huangniushan, and other places. On the 3rd, Liangkou was also recovered. Taking advantage of the momentum, the important strongholds of Shanshilingwei, Wugong Mountain, and Mibu were captured. The remnants of the Japanese army in Jilonggang were defeated and fled in disarray. At the moment, the Chinese army has advanced to Jiekou and is engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army. It is estimated that more than 6,000 Japanese troops have been killed. At the same time, the Japanese army invading from Zengcheng was also defeated. At the moment, there are no traces of the Japanese north of Zengcheng. Huaxian was recovered by the Chinese army on the 3rd. On the 4th, the Japanese reinforcements counterattacked, but were defeated by the Chinese army again. In the Xinhuai area, the Chinese army captured Muzhou, Gujing, Longquan, and other places on the 3rd, killing hundreds of Japanese troops and capturing the commander-in-chief of the puppet Southern Army, Fang Zhenghua, the battalion commander, Mo Fubiao, Japanese advisers, and more than 20 Japanese and puppet officers and soldiers, and seized a mountain gun, two mortars, and many machine guns.

The Chinese army has twice entered the Yanglousi railway station, and the Japanese losses have been extremely heavy. It has also recovered Mishan and burned the Japanese automobile station at Chaanling. On the evening of the 5th, several Japanese cars and tanks were destroyed near Yueyang, and more than 200 Japanese tank captains and soldiers were killed. The railways in Chang'an Station, Pingdiepu, and other places have been repeatedly destroyed, and even more Japanese troops have been killed.

The Japanese army in Shatang Port (east of Wuning) in northern Jiangxi was defeated by the Chinese army, and the Chinese army captured many artillery pieces and more than 100 guns. On the 2nd, a Chinese unit attacked Ruichang and killed the Japanese brigade commander and commander of the Jiujiang Garrison, Todo, and hundreds of others. On the same day, a part of the Japanese army invaded Wentou, southeast of Fengxin, and was repelled by the Chinese army. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. After the remnants of the Japanese army on the east bank of Poyang Lake were defeated by the Chinese army, they retreated to the vicinity of Hukou. The Chinese army is now pursuing them. The Chinese army has achieved significant success using the tactic of accumulating great victories from small victories.

Southern Shanxi

The Chinese army continued to exert its power and expand its war results this week. On the morning of the 1st, they captured Dongzhang (south of Changzhi) and other places in Nansong Village, and advanced to the North Song Zhao Village area. They encountered the Japanese army that was invading southward under the cover of more than ten tanks and many aircraft.

Another unit also occupied Anxi Village (south of Changzhi) and other places, cutting off the Changgao Highway, destroying more than 10 Japanese cars, and killing more than 500 Japanese troops. On the morning of the 3rd, the Japanese army in Dajingguan tried to break through and escape, and launched multiple attacks on the area of ​​Qianhougetao, but were all defeated. On the morning of the 4th, the Japanese army that attacked the Lian Tie Lu (southwest of Jincheng) was repelled.

### A Wave of "Neutrality" at the Beginning of the European War (4)

— Uncle Di

(4) Italy's "Non-Participation" (September 18th, London)

In terms of basic attitude, the countries outside the European belligerents are quite different from each other. In the previous two paragraphs, I have roughly described the attitudes of Romania and Turkey. In fact, Romania and Turkey can barely be classified into one category, because in terms of inclination, they are obviously leaning towards Britain and France. Here, Italy will be described first, and Spain will be described in the next paragraph. These two countries are just the opposite of Romania and Turkey. In terms of inclination, they are leaning towards Germany, and further, we might as well say that they are participating in Germany's battle against Britain and France in a way of "not participating in the war"—especially Italy.

I repeat, Italy is participating in Germany's war against Britain and France in a posture of "non-participation."

Originally, in a simple German-Polish war, Italy's conservative "neutrality" could have been judged long ago in the days before the war. However, in case Britain and France declared war on Germany, what would Italy's attitude be? This was something that no one dared to determine twenty days ago, and it was also the question that everyone was most concerned about.

At that time, in the midst of heavy doubts, the diplomatic contacts between Germany and Italy were stepped up. As a result, rumors became more and more rampant. Among them, the most worrying rumor for Britain and France was that in case Britain and France declared war on Germany, the Italian army would immediately attack France from the Alps, and as corroborating evidence of this rumor, the Italian army was massively concentrated in the Po River basin.

As a result, Britain and France also began diplomatic activities towards Italy. The main intention was to find out the general attitude of Italy in the event that Britain and France declared war on Germany. However, the result of the inquiry was that nothing was achieved.

Then there was the war between Germany and Poland; and then Britain and France went to war with Germany.

In this way, it came to the most critical moment of whether Italy would participate in the war or not.

At that time, although Hitler had said on the German side that Italy's participation in the war was not needed for the time being; but on the British and French side, according to our inference from the various expressions at that time, probably even if Italy participated in the war, Britain and France were prepared to deal with it. Therefore, before obtaining the guarantee that Italy would not join, Britain and France took the risk of fighting against Germany and Italy, and directly declared war on Germany, and at the same time took various preventive measures against Italy. The most notable was the widespread distribution of the British and French navies in the Mediterranean Sea, followed by the increase of British and French armies in Africa and the Near East.

However, at this critical moment, the attitude of Italy, which Britain and France had spent a lot of effort to find out, gradually began to be revealed in some other things: (1) The curfew imposed to prevent aerial night raids suddenly relaxed, and some places even lifted it. (2) The air-raid shelters that were rushed to build in Italian cities suddenly began to be dismantled everywhere. (3) The opening hours of pubs and clubs returned to normal, and nightlife resumed. (4) The Italian-French border, which had been temporarily closed, has now been reopened. (5) The suspended international traffic in Eastern Europe has also completely returned to its former state, from Paris in the west to the Balkans in the east, and passing through Italy in the middle. (6) The various routes of Italian navigation in the Mediterranean and the ocean have not only returned to their former state, but also stepped up their business and raised their market prices. For example, the price of ships to the Far East has generally increased by more than one time. …

It is by no means an accidental phenomenon that the above-mentioned trivial matters, which are casually cited, occurred simultaneously within a short period of three to five days. It is explaining an important thing: Italy will definitely not participate in the war at present. If the estimate is more precise, it will probably not take war actions before the spring of 1940.

### Amidst Preparations for War, the Dynamics of Italian Overseas Chinese Officials and Civilians in Shanghai: The Ambassador Suspends Summer Vacation to Handle Important Official Affairs; No Changes in the Italian Military Defense Zone in Western Shanghai

Italy's participation in the European war is imminent. All countries here are paying close attention to the future actions of the other party's military and government. After yesterday's visit, the dynamics of Italian overseas Chinese officials and civilians in Shanghai are recorded as follows. Italian Ambassador Ma Qiu, Consul General Na Nuni in Shanghai, and other officials of the embassy and consulate went to Beidaihe, Japan, and Dalian for summer vacation last summer, and returned to Shanghai one after another until September. Now it is summer again. The Italian consul originally planned to follow the example to go to other places for summer vacation. Now, because Italy's participation in the European war is becoming more and more imminent, according to frequent telegrams, Italy has deployed naval mines and all military measures in important areas of the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore, the Italian government officials stationed in Shanghai are staying in Shanghai and do not plan to go elsewhere. Whether they will leave Shanghai for summer vacation as usual in the near future depends on the dynamics of Italy in Europe before a decision can be made.

Ambassador's Advisor Arrives in Shanghai from Italy

Italian Ambassador's Advisor Shi Qu Nuo (C.A. Straneo) and Miss Xue Ge Nuo Lei, the niece of Robert Hart, the former Inspector General of the Chinese Customs, arrived in Shanghai last Friday on the Italian postal company's postal ship Kang Tuo Fo Tian. Shi's visit to Shanghai this time is to continue to serve as the ambassador's advisor. Amidst the tense situation in Europe, Shi's trip is attracting attention from the outside world.

The Embassy and Other Offices Are Still Working Yesterday

The Italian Embassy Office at No. 69, the Consulting Office, the Air Force Attaché Office, the First Secretary Office, the Second Secretary Office, the Counselor Office, the Consul General Office in Shanghai, the Consular Judge's Office, and the Italian Commercial Counselor Office at No. 26 The Bund, and the Italian Chamber of Commerce and other institutions were closed yesterday as it was Sunday as usual. However, in order to facilitate the receipt of information from the Italian government, only external office hours were suspended yesterday, while internal work was still handled by a part of the officials as usual.

Italian Troops in Western Shanghai Guard as Usual

Italy has a certain amount of interests in the concessions in Shanghai and Tianjin. Therefore, it has the same rights as Britain and France to have consuls and troops stationed there. The current Italian troops stationed in China are under the command of Sang Ma Ge. There are about 250 Italian troops stationed in the Italian concession in Tianjin. There are also about 250 people stationed in the western Shanghai area. The Da Guang reporter visited the Italian military defense zone yesterday and saw that the Italian barracks on Jiaozhou Road and the Italian military defense zone along Yaoshui Lane, Robert Sheng Road, Jiaozhou Road, Singapore Road, Caojiadu, and Fanwangdu were carrying out patrols and defense tasks as usual without any changes.

Even if Italy Participates in the War, It Will Not Affect the Concession

The Da Guang News Agency reporter learned from foreigners that people in China and abroad are paying close attention to the actions of Italian overseas Chinese amidst the preparations for Italy's participation in the war. Therefore, he specifically inquired from foreigners yesterday that the inherent rights of Italy in the Shanghai Public Concession will not be changed in any way even if Italy officially participates in the war in the future. At the same time, the British and American troops stationed there will cooperate to maintain the original state in order to maintain law and order. Moreover, Italian officials and civilians are staying in Shanghai as usual and have no plans to withdraw. The situation of Italian overseas Chinese in industry and commerce will also be operated as usual.

Appeal for Relief to European Refugees

As the European war expands, the areas where Belgium, the Netherlands, and northern France have fallen into the war zone are filled with refugees in France, reaching more than 5 million people, including 3 million refugees in northern France, 3 million Belgian refugees, and 100,000 refugees in the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Because they fled in a hurry, they did not even have time to bring ordinary clothes, and they are in dire need of clothing and supplies, which is pitiful. Mrs. Gothsmer, the French Ambassador, and Mrs. Orin, the French Consul General, have launched a campaign to collect items, including clothes, shoes, socks, and bedding for men, women, old and young. Anyone who wants to donate can send them to Mrs. Gothsmer at No. 2 Gongguan Road, Mrs. Orin, or Mrs. Ru Dan at No. 23, Lane 753, Haige Road, Mrs. Ba Luo at No. 783, Xiafei Road, Apartment 78, Sawa at No. 133, Shanzhong Road, Mrs. Mo Lai Si Te at the Sacred Heart Convent, Mrs. Ruo Bei, Mrs. Mei Li Ai at No. 1920, Xiafei Road, and the Sacred Heart Road at No. 622, Xiafei Road. If you do not have time to send them to the above locations, you can call 84062-3, the French Shanghai Daily, and students from the Sacred Heart Convent in uniform will be sent to pick them up.

In addition, the donations from Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai to help Dutch refugees have reached a total of 87,633 yuan in national currency and 240 US dollars as of recently.

French Defense Fund Donations Are Enthusiastic

The Western employees of the French Concession Public Works Bureau automatically donated to the French National Defense Fund, totaling 33,924.58 yuan in national currency, and sent a letter to the French Consul Orin on the 6th of this month to transfer it to the Ministry of Finance in Paris. Senior officials of the French Concession Patrol Room also automatically decided to donate 10% or 12% of their salaries each month, and requested that Consul General Orin transfer them monthly. The Chinese members of the French Concession Fire Brigade also automatically donated 10% of their salaries, totaling 562.82 yuan in national currency, and sent a letter to Consul Orin from Luo Yeer, the captain of the fire brigade, to collect and transfer them. Orin sent a letter to Bai Di'an, the general manager of the Public Works Bureau, Fa Po, the chief of the patrol room, and Luo Yeer, the president of the fire brigade, to express his gratitude to the members of their departments. It is also reported that the donations for comfort items raised by French overseas Chinese in Shanghai are very satisfactory. Many Frenchmen donate monthly. As of recently, a total of 81,990.27 yuan in national currency, 271,085 French francs, and 280 US dollars have been raised.

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Cherishes the Youth of Shanghai and Is Extremely Concerned About Compatriots in the Occupied Areas; Japanese Planes Bomb Chongqing, Further Strengthening the Will to Resist

According to a gentleman from Chongqing to Shanghai, Chongqing does not attach importance to the recent rumors in Shanghai about peace between China and Japan. This is a common trick of a certain party. Spreading such rumors is not the first time and is not worth mentioning at all. Talking about the Japanese planes attacking Chongqing for days, bombing indiscriminately, and indiscriminately bombing undefended areas, massacring civilians, and being inhuman, the people are not alarmed by the bombing of Japanese planes. Whenever they hear the alarm, women and children mostly flee into air-raid shelters first. At the same time, air-raid defense teams, fire brigades, and ambulance teams are also dispatched at any time, and the order is good. Although the Japanese planes bomb willfully, the general people are not only not intimidated, but also more determined to resist the war, and deeply believe that they will win the final victory, and this blood debt will surely be settled one day. Finally, the gentleman also told the reporter that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is very concerned about the compatriots in the occupied areas, especially the general youth in Shanghai, and has high hopes for them. During this national crisis, there are still some people who are distressed by the existence of dance halls and bars.

### Abe Convenes Japanese Consular Conference; Fu Xiaoan Has No Definite Affirmative Attitude on the "Special Police" Matter

According to reliable information obtained by the Da Guang News Agency reporter from foreigners, after the Japanese side sent Abe Nobuyuki and others to China, in order to understand all the circumstances of the military, political, and economic aspects of the occupied areas, Abe specifically convened a Japanese Consul General conference in various parts of China in the capacity of "Ambassador" to listen to reports for the purpose of making further preparations for invading China. It is heard that the meeting will be held on the 10th and 11th of this month in Nanjing. The Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura, went to attend by Japanese military plane yesterday morning.

Demanding Cooperation

The puppet "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan openly made a statement to Western reporters the day before yesterday, demanding that the authorities of the two concessions "cooperate closely" with him. It is said that the "Municipal Government" is now willing to implement "real cooperation" with the authorities of the two concessions. The relationship between the puppet "Municipal Government" and the Public Works Bureau does not seem to be very close. Therefore, he hopes that the authorities of the Public Concession can strengthen cooperation with it.

Special Police Issue

When talking about the "special police issue" on the extra-territorial roads, he hesitated and evaded the question. Regarding the establishment date of the "special police," he only said, "I hope it will be established in the near future." However, he indicated that there seem to be some other issues before the issue of police power on the extra-territorial roads can be resolved, and the opinions of both sides have not yet reached a consensus.

### Egyptian Minister to Japan Left Shanghai for Tokyo Yesterday

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that the newly appointed Egyptian Minister to Japan, Bey, left Shanghai on the 6th of this month. After staying for a few days, he is scheduled to take the President Coolidge liner on the night of the 9th to go to Japan to take up his new post.

### Inheritance Tax and Wartime Excess Profits Tax Will Be Levied Starting Next Month

The Ministry of Finance believes that the levy of direct taxes can best adapt to the taxpayer's ability to pay taxes, and is generally suitable for the tax principles discussed by scholars. Therefore, its position of residing can be seen as increasingly important. The income tax has not been established for a long time, and it has already achieved preliminary success. Therefore, a direct tax office has been established to handle the collection of various direct taxes. Now the inheritance tax and wartime excess profits tax are ready and will be implemented starting on the 1st of next month. (1) All preparations for the levy of inheritance tax are ready. For example, property investigation, uniform account names, and household registration are all under planning. The most difficult inheritance evaluation method and the application forms for collection have been determined. This direct good tax has been deeply supported by the people. In the future, we can follow this effort and echo the tax systems of advanced countries. (2) Wartime excess profits tax increases tax revenue to enrich war expenses, which is still in its decision, but its important significance lies in realizing the patriotic principle of paying money when you have money and balancing the social burden. Although this measure is a temporary measure during the war of resistance, it is actually an important page in the history of tax system reform and cannot be ignored.

### The Italian Ship Kang Tie Fo Tian Will Move to the Pontoon Today; The Decision to Load Passengers and Goods Will Be Handled by Customs Refund; Will Stay in Shanghai for a Considerable Period of Time

The Italian postal ship Kang Tie Fo Tian was ordered by the Roman government to stop all Italian mails traveling en route at neutral ports. The ship then stopped sailing back to Europe. It is now learned that the ship is scheduled to move from the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou to the Pujiang Pontoon today. Although the future actions have not been decided, the company's direction has decided to refund tickets and customs duties for all passengers and goods loaded to Europe. The Xinsheng News Agency reporter continued to record the details as follows:

Moving to the Pontoon

After Kang Dai Fo Tian Lun was ordered to temporarily dock at a neutral port to await orders, the company officially announced yesterday that the departure date had been changed, and said that it would be announced again after the date was determined. Yesterday, as of the evening, the ship was still berthed at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. However, according to the person in charge of the company, the company decided to move the ship to the Pujiang Pontoon today because the place is a British wharf, and then wait for orders quietly.

Ticket and Customs Refund

Regarding the goods that the ship has already contacted to be loaded and transported to Hong Kong, Nanyang, and various ports in Europe, and the passenger tickets that have been sold, the company has decided to refund all freight and passenger tickets because even if it is ordered to leave Shanghai, it will not stop at the countries along the way according to the original route. This notice will be published in one or two days. As for the more than 100 tons of goods transported to Shanghai a few days ago, they have been completely unloaded.

Temporarily Staying in Shanghai

As for the whereabouts of the ship in the future, the Italian Postal Company sent a telegram to the Roman government a few days ago, asking for instructions. As of last night, the company had not received a reply. Therefore, it cannot be decided where the ship will be berthed in the future. According to general observation, if the ship leaves Shanghai, it will inevitably pass through Hong Kong and the British territories in Nanyang. At present, navigation is not hindered in any way, but it cannot be reconciled with the order to dock at neutral ports. Therefore, the ship may stay in Shanghai for a considerable period of time.

Changing to US Dollars

According to shipping industry news, after the European situation became tense, the Italian ships sailing to the Americas and the Far East no longer used Italian currency but switched to US dollars. This time, when the Kang Tie Fo Tian Lun left Europe, passengers were required to purchase tickets in US dollars. The fares to China were uniformly sold at 170 US dollars for third-class tickets, which is equivalent to more than 3,000 Chinese yuan, which is unprecedentedly expensive. Food was also bought and sold on board in US dollars, and Italian currency could no longer be used. According to the crew, this is because the company also needs to purchase goods from various places in US dollars.

Captain's Statement

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that the Japanese "Mainland News" reported that the Italian postal ship Kang Tuo Fo Tian, which was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 9th and sail back to Genoa, Italy, has now postponed its departure and will be berthed indefinitely at a Japanese wharf instead of a British wharf. According to the captain of the ship, "The Mainland News" reporter said that although Italian cargo ships will maintain regular sailings, the Italian passenger ships sailing to Shanghai will probably be the last one of the Kang Tuo Fo Tian. As for the political significance of the ship's suspension of sailings, he cannot comment or explain. He believes that the ship's suspension of sailings is an indication that Italy is about to participate in the war. Now all matters are in the hands of the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and the Italian people are prepared to follow the orders of their leader.

German Peace Sailing Town

Italian merchant ships sailing within Chinese territorial waters are still sailing as usual. The German Peace Lun of the Italian merchant Zhongyi Company left Shanghai for Zhenhai at 5 pm yesterday. It is reported that this type of sailing ship is different because it sails within the territorial waters of neutral countries. Therefore, even if Italy participates in the war, it may not be affected in any way. Just like German merchant ships sailing in China, they will sail as usual.

### Tokyo Telegraphs Negotiated the Tianjin Issue; Japan Hopes that Britain Will Change its Entire North China Policy; Even if Silver is Resolved, It Is Difficult to Fill the Japanese People's Abyss of Desire

The Zi Lin West News on June 8, Tokyo Telegraphs, said that the British Ambassador here and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs both told reporters today that Britain and Japan can probably negotiate an agreement on the British Concession in Tianjin within two weeks. According to the British Embassy spokesperson, there are still some points that have not been resolved, but these outstanding cases are expected to be negotiated quickly. The issue of removing the Tianjin Concession blockade,

Seems Quite Ambiguous

The attitude that the Japanese side has held so far is that if Britain wants to cancel the blockade, it should change its policy on the entire North China issue and cooperate sincerely with the Japanese people. The Japanese Ministry of the Army said that the Japanese side generally has a tendency to temporarily not abolish the blockade. The point to be resolved is not only

The silver in the concession, but the Japanese side is also seeking the cooperation of Britain. The British Embassy spokesperson also said that he cannot断言 on the matter of the blockade being lifted, and the exact amount of silver in the concession has not been determined. If the blockade is not lifted, then the silver issue, even if it is negotiated, is still不得告知 .

Bilateral Negotiations

Of course, efforts have been made to delay the European war in London and Paris. However, at present, the difficulty of the situation is that the Japanese attitude has indeed slowed down. The agreement in the proposals of both sides stipulates that the British Concession will hand over silver worth 100,000 pounds in British gold and the French Concession will hand over silver worth 200,000 pounds in British gold.

Purchasing Australian Wheat

To relieve the people of North China, the remaining silver will be sealed by the British, Japanese, and French Japanese consultations. Sir 克莱琪, the British Ambassador to Japan, also seems to represent the French government. The Japanese Ministry of the Army told reporters that the negotiations do not involve the return of the concession. When the time for returning the concession arrives, Japan may take the lead in this.

### Polish Overseas Chinese Citizen Min Shi Broadcast the Night Before, Revealing German Propaganda Methods, the Fifth Column Secretly Deployed Everywhere

Polish overseas Chinese Pi Chen Shi broadcast the night before last at the French radio station in Shanghai, revealing how the Nazis trained the German people's fighting spirit and prepared to launch a war before the Second European War. The German authorities used various propaganda methods in advance to calm the hearts of the people in the civilized countries so that they would not suspect what actions the German side was preparing to take in the future. Pi Chen Shi specifically raised the views of the Nazi military theorist Pang Xi. Pang said that we are engaged in fighting with military, economic, and spiritual weapons, among which spiritual weapons are especially important. All social problems are still within the scope of spiritual problems based on the final analysis. Therefore, we must

Launching a war 对一 publicity matters, but we should not 为 为 岸月 can be收所 落良之宣传 after years of work, it must be创始侯 war started during peacetime, then we will see its significance immediately is the only 大 successful. Pang Xi also advocated the establishment of German overseas Chinese organizations in various parts of the world. All German overseas Chinese abroad were forced to participate. The organization is the总 source of all Nazis. The organization also established a "Fifth Column." In the Norwegian campaign, its horrific activities were evident. Pi Chen Shi continued to say that the Fifth Column is also one of the modern warfare methods, and its branches are located in various countries around the world. They first contacted the writers of various countries, and then used newspapers, movies, and radio broadcasts to exert the power of their propaganda. Other establishment of clubs, social groups, and reading rooms are also media to achieve the purpose of propaganda. Nazis

Foreign organizations are actually merged into German diplomatic agencies, and their activities enjoy diplomacy protection. Before 1937, the German authorities still pretended that they were not related to the Nazi Party's foreign organizations, but in January 1937, they formally recognized that the organizations had the right to manage the behavior of German foreigners in the country where they were located and other matters. In the summer of the same year, the relationship between German diplomatic authorities and foreign organizations became increasingly closer.

### Soldiers Injured in the War of Resistance are Called "Honorary Soldiers" and 除 are 行

The Ministry of Internal Affairs informed the governments of 各 cities and counties that the management office of the Central Government 兵 presented a report transferred by the參 General Staff 长 He and signed by Minister Chen of the Political Department. The report stated that soldiers injured in the War of Resistance were uniformly called 残废军人. We believe that this title will have an adverse impact on the morale of the soldiers and is not a way to respect the soldiers who fought in the War of Resistance. It is proposed that the words残废 should be abolished and changed to "Honorary Soldiers." The wound administration agencies named after 残废 should also be changed accordingly. "The case has been approved after the office drafted the renamed照表, the report said, and should be handled accordingly. It is hereby ordered that all wounded administration agencies should comply.

### Inferior Food Found in the French Concession: Milk is Infiltrated with Water and Drinks are Made with Dyes; Many Counterfeit Wines are Sold and are Heavily Punished

At the beginning of last month, the exchange rate in Shanghai changed drastically and prices soared. Many unscrupulous merchants who only sought profit擅 changed the instruments of weights and measures and used people to enrich themselves. In order to crack down on this illegal act, the French Concession authorities not only formulated a new system of weights and measures and announced implementation, but also severely punished merchants who violated the system and changed it privately. According to the平价 Committee of the French Concession, the inspection of food is as follows: (1) The following violations of meat were reported: seven cases of selling buffalo meat, nine cases of selling meat that was stamped and then wiped off, two cases of selling second-class meat, and three cases of selling meat that was not stamped. (2) For milk, three samples were extracted, and it was found that there was 5% infiltration of water, which was fined 300 yuan. (3) For bread, all the bread that was inspected was found to be consistent with the weight indicated. (4) For beverages, the crackdown on counterfeit beverages is still ongoing. 子, A certain number used dyes to manufacture beverages in large quantities and sold them in the name of wine and Shandong wine, and was fined 1,500 yuan.丑, A certain number used inferior alcohol to sell Hennessy brand brandy, and was fined 300 yuan.寅, A certain number sold alcohol that did not indicate the source, and was fined 100 yuan.

### Yesterday Afternoon's Major Fire on Yidingpan Road Spread to Forty or Fifty Buildings, Destroyed a Fire Engine, and Injured a Total of Eight People

Around 11:17 AM yesterday, a major fire suddenly broke out at the southeastern corner of Yidingpan Road, a road built beyond the boundary in western Shanghai, and extended to forty or fifty buildings. A fire engine was damaged by the flames, and five firefighters from various fire brigades were injured and sent to the Public Concession hospital for treatment. The fire was finally extinguished around 2:30 PM. The details of the affected properties are recorded as follows:

Raging Flames

Around 11:17 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out in the residential buildings east of Xidingpan Road. Black smoke billowed and flames raged, visible from a distance. The newly built houses along the road were mostly single-story wooden structures. Combined with the drought and dry weather, once ignited, the fire was difficult to control. The Local and Road Fire Brigade, the Central Fire Brigade, the Caojiadu Fire Brigade, and the News Fire Brigade all rushed pumper trucks to the scene to put out the fire. However, the fire spread rapidly, and their efforts were like a drop in the bucket. By 2:30 PM, the fire had not been completely extinguished, and more than a hundred households were affected.

Several People Injured

During the height of the fire, fire engine number 40, "Ceng Hai Ting," was damaged by the flames, and its machinery was damaged beyond repair. The arm of the car's driver was also burned. At the same time, firefighters from various districts bravely rescued people, resulting in injuries to five people, including those with numbers 501, 44, 360, 649, and 748, who suffered burns to their hands, arms, and heads. They were transported to the Public Concession Hospital. In addition, three residents were injured and sought treatment at the hospital on their own.

Affected Households

Information reveals that the affected households include the Wan Ronghua Coal Company at number 804 (entire building), the Da Xin Auto Repair Shop at number 806, and the Fu Yuan Pawnshop at numbers 808-810, the facade of which remained relatively intact, but the interior was completely destroyed, causing significant losses. The fire also spread to number 711 Xin Ji Hardware Store, number 707 Yuan He Lumber, Hua Tai Paint Store, Da Sheng Tea Shop, and Guang Sheng Sand Shop on Yidingpan Road, all of which were almost completely destroyed. Other businesses, such as barber shops, enamelware stores, flour shops, dyeing shops, and dozens of residences, were also affected. However, the shop signs and names were destroyed, making it difficult to identify them immediately. The fire lasted for more than four hours. As of 7:30 PM, the fire brigades were still sifting through the rubble. The police department is still conducting a thorough investigation into the cause of the fire and who was responsible.

### Kidnapping Incident on Hongqiao Road

At around 3:00 PM yesterday, a man, dressed in a light gray silk gown, wearing a straw hat and glasses, and appearing to be in his forties, was riding in a rickshaw on Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai, traveling from west to east. When he reached the intersection of Da Xi Road, three young men – two in Western suits and one in blue cloth shirt and pants – suddenly appeared with pistols and stopped him. They dragged the man from the rickshaw and kidnapped him, heading north (towards Huobi Road). The name of the kidnapped person and the original details could not be ascertained.

### Arrest of Old Yu Tai Hotel Owner and Others; Manager's Heavy Gambling Debts Neglecting Business; Customers' Large Orders of Shaoxing Wine Cannot Be Delivered

The Old Yu Tai Hotel at the intersection of Yunnan Road and Shantou Road was founded by Tang Jiapeng, also known as Tang A'yu, who was assassinated many years ago. The ownership of the hotel has changed hands several times. Last year, a Mr. Chen from Changzhou took over the business. Not long after, the owner fell ill and passed away. The business was managed by his son-in-law, Gong Guoliang from Suzhou, with Zhu Runan as assistant manager. They promoted the business, engaging not only in retail but also in wholesale of Shaoxing wine. Recently, Yong Fu Chang, Tong Feng Hao, Bi Hu Xuan, Zhang Yu Tang Zhang Wenzheng, Wu Chuan Zhong, Hua Gen Zhi, Ma Bai Tang, Shen Ai Tang and other ten firms ordered large quantities of Shaoxing wine from the Old Yu Tai Hotel through managers Gong Guoliang and Zhu Runan, worth tens of thousands of taels. They paid Gong and Zhu over 21,000 yuan as deposit. Both parties signed contracts, stamped with the Old Yu Tai seal, with delivery scheduled before the Dragon Boat Festival. However, Gong had been frequenting gambling dens in western Shanghai, incurring heavy losses. Unable to raise funds to fulfill the delivery, he left the store without saying goodbye. Upon discovering Gong's departure and the large wine orders, the hotel commissioned lawyer Yang Junlin to publish a statement in the newspaper, stating that Gong Guoliang's affairs were his sole responsibility and not related to the hotel. Seeing the notice, Yong Fu Chang and the other ten firms jointly commissioned lawyer Zhang Shibeng to publish a rebuttal in the newspaper and reported to the police that the hotel owner, the widow Mrs. Chen, and managers Gong and Zhu were engaged in a joint fraud. The police arrested only assistant manager Zhu Runan. Later, they collaborated with the French police to arrest the hotel owner and Mrs. Chen on Rue Paul Beau (蒲柏路), pending transfer to the court for prosecution. Meanwhile, they are searching for the absconding Gong Guoliang to bring him to justice.

### Two Convicted of Abducting Women Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment

Tong Rende, a well-known tourist guide from Ningbo and owner of the Shanghai Guang Tourist Guide Agency, recently established in Nanjing's Confucius Temple street, catered to clients seeking pleasure. He partnered with Wu Jincheng from Tongzhou, who specialized in luring women into prostitution. They opened room 25 in the Jiangxin Hotel at 40 North Shanxi Road. They lured ten women, including Mao Aidi and Lu Zhoushi, to the hotel, giving them tens of dollars each to stay in the room temporarily, falsely claiming they were looking for tourists. They did not explicitly mention going to Nanjing to engage in prostitution. It was only in late last month, when they were asked to obtain permits and take photos in a certain area of Hongkou, with the threat of immediate repayment of the money if they refused, that the women realized they had been deceived and had no choice but to obey Tong and Wu. On the morning of the 22nd, at 4:00 AM, just as they were about to depart for Nanjing, detectives Wu Dekui and Hao Shangqin from the Gordon Road police station uncovered the case and arrested Tong Rende and Wu Jincheng. The ten women, including Mao, were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Two of the women, Lu Didi from Ningbo and Li Qingmei and Li Qingxia from Jiangsu, were claimed by their mothers, Lu Ye and Li Wang. The others are temporarily staying at the Women and Children Relief Association. The case was further heard by Judge Huang Risheng in court the day before yesterday. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated that the families of Mao Aidi, Mao Juzhen, Wang Manna, and Yuan Genbao were present in court to claim them, while the others remained at the Relief Association, pending claim by their relatives. He requested punishment for the two defendants. Judge Huang, after questioning, sentenced Tong Rende and Wu Jincheng to six months imprisonment as a warning. Mao Aidi, Mao Juzhen, Wang Manna, and Yuan Genbao were allowed to be claimed by Wang Yanshi, Yuan Wangshi, and Yang Gushi (Mao's aunt), while Zhou Baiyun, Chen Cuiying, and Lu Zhoushi remained at the Women and Children Relief Association pending claim.

### Car Accident on Jing'an Temple Road Injured Three People

At approximately 6:40 PM yesterday, at the intersection of Jing'an Temple and Carter Road, a couple in their forties, along with a boy of about ten years old, were crossing the road from south to north when a black private car, number 19688, speeding from east to west, struck them. The couple were holding hands and hesitated upon seeing the car approaching, unable to avoid it. All three were knocked down and seriously injured, bleeding profusely. Nearby officers rushed to the scene, recorded the car's number, and sent the three injured people to the hospital for treatment. According to witnesses, the woman suffered the most severe head injuries.

### Defendants in Abortion Causing Death Case Await Sentencing

Peng Yangshi, a local woman residing at 120 Glen Road in Yangshupu, discovered that her eighteen-year-old daughter, Peng Genhuo, a worker at the China Soap Factory on Yangshupu Road, was pregnant despite being unmarried. Her mother, Peng Yangshi, discovered her daughter's secret on May 20th. Concerned about her reputation, she discussed an abortion with her uncle-in-law, Lu Delin, and entrusted Liu Huangshi, an obstetrician residing at 17 Lane 795 Pingliang Road, to perform the abortion for a fee of 40 yuan, with an initial payment of 20 yuan. Room 36 was booked at the Quan'an Hotel on Yangshupu Road. A tube of "duijie grass" was inserted into the daughter's private area, but due to unskilled surgery, the fetus did not descend, and Peng died on the night of the 23rd. The hotel staff reported to the Yulin Road police station, who sent detective Zhang Yunhong to take the body to the mortuary. Peng Yangshi, Lu Delin, Liu Huangshi, and an old woman, Huang Qishi, were arrested and sent to the First Special Court for trial. The case was further heard by Judge Liu in the Third Criminal Court the day before yesterday. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed charges according to the law, stating that during the adjournment, the court had received an anonymous letter alleging that the deceased had been strangled, and the police had been instructed to investigate. The investigation revealed that the marks on the deceased's neck were due to the "ti sha" (提痧) treatment performed by Huang Qishi and others to relieve her "fa sha" (發痧) ailment. The German medical report also stated that the death was caused by the abortion. When questioned, Liu Huangshi admitted to performing the abortion, while the other defendants gave evasive answers and hired lawyers such as Zheng Wenkai to defend them. The court ordered that the case be adjourned and sentenced next Wednesday.

### Opening of the Neuropsychiatric Treatment Center Yesterday

The Neuropsychiatric Treatment Center, jointly established by the World Red Swastika Society and the Shanghai Mental Hygiene Promotion Association, was officially opened yesterday at 3:00 PM at the Red Swastika Society Hospital at 1171 YuYuan Road. Guests included Mr. He Dekui from the Public Works Department, Dr. McCleary, President of the Medical School of St. John's University, Dr. Weisbrod, President of the Shanghai Mental Hygiene Promotion Association, Zhou Zongliang, the responsible president of the China General Association of the World Red Swastika Society, Li Tianzhen, Zhang Lanping, Ma Zhongwu, Zhao Daoci, Yang Yuanji, president of Da De Hospital, neurologists Zeng Jingchen, Han Fen, and Li Bangzheng, and other Chinese and foreign guests, about one hundred in total.

Subsequently, the society hosted all the guests for a photo session and tea party in the garden, which ended at 5:00 PM.

### The Second Special District Court Interrogated the Trafficking Case Yesterday, Alleging That the Abductors Carried Belts

In April, the Jiaxing Road police uncovered a major trafficking gang, arresting ten men and women, including the trafficker Ling Rongsen. It was found that they had abducted more than 150 boys and girls, who were sent to the First Special District Court for prosecution and sentenced to heavy prison terms. Because the gang had also committed similar abductions within the French Concession, the French police sent detectives to the First Special District Court to transfer the traffickers Ling Rongsen, Ling Zhangshi, Dai Lushi, Wang Lishi, Wang Wushi, Zhuge Qianshi, Zhuge Chun, Lu Wenzhong, Wang Zhangshi, and Cui Tengshi to the Second Special District Court for interrogation. The details have been reported in this newspaper. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Sun continued the hearing in the First Criminal Court. Police lawyer Chen Ming reported on the investigation and charged the defendants with abducting males under the age of sixteen from their families for the purpose of profit. Then, the investigating detective Yan Jinwen reported that the number of victims reported in this case exceeded one hundred. Six victims appeared in court today and requested to be questioned. The defendant Ling Rongsen confessed in court that he lived at 355 Baoding Road and sent the abducted children to Xiamen to be sold to Su Deshan, who lived at 29 Shuixian Road, for about 100 yuan per child. When questioned, the other defendants were evasive. The court also questioned the victims one by one. Due to the importance of the case and the need for further investigation, the hearing was adjourned to the 20th of this month. The defendants were taken into custody. After the court adjourned, the victims, filled with hatred for the defendants who had torn their families apart, followed and tried to bite them to vent their anger. They were stopped and dispersed by the French police and the bailiffs, and the defendants were able to escape to the detention center.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that Shandong and surrounding areas were clear with fog and southeast to southwest winds. The local area was cloudy and clear with southeast winds. The area south of Ma'an Island and east of the East China Sea will be cloudy and may experience rain or fog with northeast winds. Also, within the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the local temperature reached a high of 83.7 and a low of 61.0. On the same day last year, the high was 95.5 and the low was 67.5.

### The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education's Improvements to Wartime Local and Elementary Social Education (2): Regarding the Restoration of Educational Administrative Institutions in Occupied Counties

By the first semester of the 28th academic year, the attached elementary school of Shihuxian Teachers' School, such as the attached elementary school of Rushixian Teachers' School, and Futong Elementary School had successively resumed classes on their own. However, how to appropriately locate the schools and determine the number of grades to meet the needs of each area required re-adjustment based on the actual situation in each location. Therefore, at the beginning of this semester, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education changed the names of the affiliated elementary schools of the provincial Huaishi Rushixian Teachers' School, Haishi JieShouxian Teachers' School, Shihuxian Teachers' School, and Zaoyan Teachers' School, as well as the Luxun elementary schools in Nantong, to Provincial First to Eighth Temporary Elementary Schools. The Department considered the local situation, changed the location of the schools, and stipulated the number of grades. The Department also added a ninth provincial temporary elementary school in the Xu area and promulgated the Regulations for the Establishment of Provincial Temporary Elementary Schools in Jiangsu and the Guidelines for Central Work to each school for compliance.

(4) Running Elementary School Teacher Training Classes and War Zone Elementary School Teacher Training Groups. Elementary education in Jiangsu Province originally had a solid foundation. However, since the outbreak of the war, teachers have been displaced and relocated, and the quality of teachers has been uneven. Some teachers had been in service for many years and lacked motivation, while others lacked qualifications and filled positions without competence. The Jiangsu Department of Education, recognizing this and the urgent need to prepare for the promotion of national education, specially formulated temporary measures for elementary school teacher training classes in each county and temporary measures for mobile training groups for elementary school graduates in war zone counties in order to improve the quality of elementary school teachers and refresh the spirit of elementary education. These measures were ordered to be implemented in each county, and teachers were uniformly provided with short-term training to enhance their effectiveness in the war of resistance and national construction, thereby improving elementary schools in each county throughout the province and preparing for the promotion of national education. This measure has significant implications for the future of education in each county. (5) Restore the Dongtai Dafeng Reclamation Area Moral Education Experimental Zone. The Dongtai Dafeng Reclamation Area Moral Education Experimental Zone was originally headed by personnel from the Jiangsu Department of Education in the 26th year of the Republic. Later, after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Dongtai was occupied ten times, and Japanese troops harassed the towns in the reclamation area. The district was forced to temporarily suspend operations, and all education in the reclamation area was managed by the county education bureau. However, the area was located in a remote coastal area, making it inconvenient for the education bureau to manage. In order to meet the needs, the Jiangsu Department of Education specially restored the moral education experimental zone, establishing a management committee in March and appointing Ji Zhenru, the former director of the Dongtai Education Bureau, as the director of the district. From then on, the moral education in the district can gradually expand in an orderly manner.

(6) Vigorously Promote Compulsory Education. Investigations have found that more than a dozen counties in northern Jiangsu have increased the number of compulsory education classes this year, with 657 new classes added. In areas occupied and where compulsory education classes cannot be established, local people are encouraged to establish charity schools to implement compulsory education, and subsidies are provided according to their performance.

(7) Unify and Improve Private Tutoring Education. Before the war, government offices in various counties of Jiangsu Province had made various efforts to ban private tutoring schools. To date, the number of private tutoring schools in each county has not decreased much. In fact, if private tutoring schools are properly managed, it may not be impossible to transform the bad into the good, and the bitter fruit into sweet. Turning all private tutoring schools into standard elementary schools or charity schools is a matter of transition. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education specially issued the "General Outline of the Jiangsu Province's Plan to Unify and Improve Private Tutoring Education" this semester in order to actively improve private tutoring education in each county throughout the province and achieve the effectiveness of supplementing compulsory education. Temporary measures for guiding private tutoring schools in each county and temporary measures for teacher training classes in each county are also formulated. It is expected that after the summer vacation this year, not only can the progress of private tutoring education in each county be expected, but most of the tutors, after training, can be used as teacher resources for the future promotion of national education. Truly a win-win situation.

(8) Adjust Elementary School Teachers in Each County. Since the Great War, the supply and demand of elementary school teachers in northern Jiangsu has often been unable to meet the needs. In general, it is not easy to find adequate work for elementary school teachers in counties that have been heavily affected by the war. Recognizing this, the Jiangsu Department of Education specially formulated "Temporary Measures for Adjusting Elementary School Teachers in Each County" in order to ensure that the supply and demand of elementary school teachers in each county is suitable and the distribution is balanced. Before the start of each semester, the Education Bureau of each county should conduct a general registration of all elementary school teachers in the county and try to appoint all qualified teachers in the county. If there is a shortage, the lack of teachers should be reported to the Department for unified allocation. Since the implementation, there has been no phenomenon of surplus or shortage of teachers in each county.

(9) Plan and Promote National Education. Since the central government stipulated that national education will be implemented from August this year, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education is actively preparing in accordance with the steps stipulated by the Ministry of Education. The following has been carried out: (1) Printing and distributing the Outline for the Implementation of National Education promulgated by the Ministry of Education; (2) Formulating forms to investigate the population, number of townships and guarantees, number of schools, number of grades, number of students, funding and teacher resources in each county throughout the province, and setting a deadline for filling in the forms; (3) Formulating the "Jiangsu Province's Plan for Implementing National Education", which has been submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval, stipulating the steps for implementing national education in five years. At the same time, a plan for training and cultivating teachers is being drafted in order to store a large number of teacher resources for the preparation for the phased promotion of national education.

(10) Compile and Print Elementary School War of Resistance Teaching Materials. Because the traffic between the counties in northern Jiangsu and Shanghai is blocked, the students in schools in each county need textbooks at the beginning of the semester, and it is almost impossible to supply them. In addition to a few entrusting bookstores to find ways to purchase them, most of them are mimeographed by themselves or entrusted to printing houses for printing. Also, the content of the textbooks often loses its meaning of the times and does not meet the current needs. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education originally had a compilation and review office, which started editing this semester. The elementary school war of resistance teaching materials recently completed include the Chinese language common sense textbook for the middle grades of elementary school and the advanced Chinese language social textbook. The counties have now been notified and the number of copies needed in each county has been surveyed in order to count and print them. In addition to compiling the above-mentioned textbooks, the compilation and review office has also reviewed various literacy textbooks for the people submitted by each county, and the work is quite intense.

### Small Football Tournament a Complete Success: Tung Tze-lai Wins Group A Championship; Kau Lin's Physical Strength Proves Insufficient, Resulting in a 1-3 Loss; Jewish Club Wins Group B Championship

The second annual Aurora Cup small football tournament concluded successfully yesterday after the Group A and B finals. The competition lasted for a month and a half, with 38 teams participating, not including international matches. All championship titles have now been awarded, with only the Manfu Cup charity match to be held next Saturday. The championship winners are as follows:

International Cup Championship - China Team (donated by the Deputy Brazilian Consul in Shanghai, Carloni). Group A League Championship - Tung Tze-lai (donated by Aurora University). Group B League Championship - Jewish Club (donated by Mr. Tao Jinrong). Yesterday's two finals both produced unexpected results. The Russian expatriate team was defeated by the Jewish team, suffering a shutout. In the Group A championship battle between Kau Lin and Tung Tze-lai, the Kau Lin players suffered from inferior physical strength. Clever tactics could not overcome brute force, resulting in a painful 1-3 loss. This clearly demonstrates that in sports, physical strength is the key to success or failure, while technical skill is only a small part of the equation. After the matches, Mr. Tao Jinrong, donor of the Shun Kee Cup (Group B), and Father Li, representative of Aurora University, donor of the Aurora Cup (Group A), presented the awards. Kau Lin also received a Citibank Cup, while Tung Tze-lai, in addition to winning the overall championship, also received a "French Water Cup" donated by Mr. Tu Zhongbao. The match reports are as follows:

Kau Lin vs. Tung Tze-lai Dramatic Battle Report

Kau Lin suffered a significant loss in strength due to Chen Ji-zhi's inability to play. From the start, Tung Tze-lai launched a fierce attack, but Kau Lin's defense was effective, with Qin Bi-gao making numerous saves. The two sides were evenly matched, holding each other off for more than twenty minutes, with neither side able to score. In the twenty-fifth minute, Tung Tze-lai launched a fierce attack. Yue Renxiao, eager to defend, committed a foul in the penalty area. [ ] took the penalty kick. Kau Lin was fortunate to avoid [ ]. Tung Tze-lai took a 1-0 lead in the first half. Tung Tze-lai's Huang Mao Maikelade [ ], had already suffered an ankle injury in the previous final [ ]. Yesterday, the old injury recurred, and he was replaced by Austin. After switching sides, Kau Lin was still under pressure due to their inferior physical strength. After about ten minutes, Yue Renxiao missed a tackle, and Pal rushed into the gap [ ], headed the ball [ ], Tung Tze-lai volleyed the shot, Qin Bi-gao was unable to save it. Kau Lin conceded two goals in a row, and launched a counterattack, but unfortunately, every time they reached a critical moment, they were intercepted. Until the last five minutes, Gao Baozheng took a corner kick, sending the ball directly to the left side, 30 yards out. Yue Renxiao, without waiting for the ball to stop, volleyed it directly into the left corner. Mao Liesi was caught off guard, and Kau Lin pulled one back. Yue Renxiao's shot was met with thunderous applause. After this, Kau Lin's counterattack became more urgent, hoping to tie the game, but their luck was not good. Xiao Xintian and Gao Baozheng made two excellent tackles, but both shots flew high and wide of the right corner. With the entire team committed to the attack, the defense was exposed. Austin sent a long pass, and the Kau Lin players mistakenly thought it was offside and ignored it. Unexpectedly, Jielai rushed in like a flash of lightning. Qin Bi-gao was isolated and helpless and was shot into the empty net. Thus, Kau Lin's fate was sealed. Soon after, the whistle blew, and Tung Tze-lai won the Group A championship with a score of 3-1.

### How to Promote Foreign Trade: Summary of Records of a Seminar Jointly Organized by This Publication and the Economic Research Department of Global Trust Company

The previous issue has already published the two sections "International Trade and National Economy" (speakers included Chairman Lu Zhixue, Zhang Yifan, and Yao Qingsan) and "The Current Trade Environment in Our Country" (speakers included Chairman Yu Zhongkui, Zhang Yifan, Li Shifan, and Wu Yugan), as well as the insightful remarks by Chairman, Gan Dounan, and Nie Guangdi in the section "Promoting Trade and Finance." This issue continues to publish the rest of the article to complete the whole picture. (Editor's Note)

Wu Wenying, Xu Shimin, Yang Dehui

Li Shoulu: My brother and I once received an export order and requested a loan from the Huashang Bank. They said, "The interest on buying foreign exchange is much greater than the interest on lending," so they refused. On the contrary, foreign banks are sometimes willing to help us a little. The solution to this problem is only through government orders. The development of the export business can only be achieved with the help of Huashang Banks.

Lu Xilin: Banks do not completely refuse to provide credit loans. The reason why they cannot do so on a large scale is that banks themselves have many difficulties. Because financial fluctuations in Shanghai are severe and there are many risks involved in exports, banks have to tighten credit loans to the general industrial and commercial sectors. As for customers with a long history of dealing with the bank, they still do so. The industrial and commercial sectors are wronged when they blame the banks for not lending. It is absolutely impossible for banks not to lend. More imports lead to a reduction in foreign exchange. However, the reason for the current reduction in foreign exchange is not entirely due to more imports. The majority is due to speculation. If speculation does not stop, finance cannot be stabilized. If finance is not stable, banks cannot lend on a large scale. Therefore, the core issue is that the banking sector does not "settle forward foreign exchange" for speculators. Not settling forward foreign exchange can reduce speculation. However, it is not easy to do so in this special environment.

Gan Dounan: Promoting trade requires the help of banks to develop. Export trade is determined by foreigners to us. Even if the Chinese don't do it, foreign firms will still do it. If foreigners do it, the foreign exchange will fall into the hands of foreigners. Therefore, export businesses must be done directly by Chinese people and foreigners. Direct dealings require the help of banks to purchase raw materials needed for production. This is obviously different from speculation and hoarding.

Promoting Trade and the National Goods Industry

Chairman: Everyone has discussed the relationship between promoting trade and the financial sector in great detail. Now we have come to the national goods industry. Please discuss the advantages and disadvantages, difficulties, and solutions of our country's international trade from the perspective of national goods manufacturers and vendors of domestic raw materials.

Zhang Yifan: National goods manufacturers use domestic raw materials, so there is no risk of unstable foreign exchange. Is the purpose of the loan to buy raw materials? Therefore, the bank should investigate the purchasing merchant. Or after the manufacturer receives the raw materials, the bank directly pays for the goods. Or the raw material merchant introduces the bank to lend. Suppose there are no domestic raw materials or there are not enough, and you cannot buy them from foreign countries, you can also investigate. If you are afraid of losses due to foreign exchange fluctuations and do not lend, this seems unreasonable.

Yu Zhongkui: The financial sector itself does have its difficulties. Time deposits decrease, and demand deposits increase. Banks must be fully prepared. Therefore, lending is very difficult. The industrial sector has difficulties, and the banks also have difficulties. They have to pay interest on deposits, and they also have to lose interest on the reserve.

Zhang Yifan: If manufacturers import raw materials, they can directly borrow foreign exchange from the bank. In the future, they will also repay in foreign exchange, which is convenient for both parties.

Lu Xilin: All commercial banks are doing this.

Gan Dounan: The financial sector's difficulties are indeed a fact, so we must find ways to solve them. In short, loans to Chinese manufacturers should be done by Huashang Banks. If foreign banks can do it, but we cannot help ourselves, wouldn't that be a joke?

Li Shoulu: The reason why foreign banks can do it, but Chinese banks cannot, is because foreign banks have lower deposit interest rates, or even no interest at all. Huashang Banks generally have very high interest rates, such as 4% weekly interest for demand deposits and 7% for time deposits...

Yu Zhongkui: Depositors can use demand deposits to speculate at any time, but banks cannot use them for lending. Banks themselves also have to do business to survive.

You Boqun: These are all related to the environment, and there is no fundamental solution.

Chairman: All parties have their inherent difficulties. I would like to tell a joke here. On May 2nd, foreign exchange suddenly decreased sharply. Shops rushed to increase prices by several percent immediately. Therefore, everyone expressed dissatisfaction and thought that merchants were deliberately manipulating prices and harming society. However, according to the opinions of the shops, when foreign exchange decreases, the public will rush to buy and hoard goods. If the shops do not raise prices, their inventory will be bought out, and they will have nothing to sell. In this way, customers blame the shops for raising prices, and the shops blame the customers for hoarding goods. It is difficult to tell who is right and who is wrong. However, in fact, everyone is wrong. We are very happy today that everyone can sincerely discuss this in detail. Therefore, we have a better understanding of the difficulties faced by the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors. However, I believe that the development of national goods manufacturers and import and export businesses cannot be achieved without the help of the financial sector. And the financial sector needs the prosperity of industry and commerce to find a proper outlet. Therefore, in the face of difficulties for everyone, we must think of more proactive ways to understand and help each other to achieve mutual benefits.

Yu Zhongkui: It is also the fault of the buyers, and you cannot blame the shops for raising prices. If the shops do not raise prices, their goods will be bought out, and how can they continue to operate? In addition to closing down and having a big sale, the selling price must be slightly higher than the price of goods purchased at the time.

Promoting Trade and Import and Export Businesses

Chairman: Now let's discuss promoting trade and import and export businesses. Please express your opinions from the perspective of import and export merchants, overseas consumers, and overseas import and export companies.

Feng Hengqin: Regarding promoting export exchange, I wrote an article in 1933 advocating that the financial industry should provide special financing to export merchants as much as possible. The methods are as follows: (1) Advances, interest, and [ ], should be [ ] given to the amount of import [ ]. (2) Request foreign branches or agent banks to observe the sales trends of goods for export exchange done by the entrusted bank with an objective eye and prepare detailed reports at any time to be forwarded to export merchants so that they can know what to improve.

Now, not only export exchange should be supported, but also import exchange. In order to promote production, the financial industry should also provide convenience to legitimate national goods manufacturers who purchase raw materials abroad. However, the entire Shanghai market after the war has been shrouded in the power of hoarding and speculation. Although the financial industry has already provided some financing to import and export merchants, in fact, import and export merchants hope that the financial industry will provide much more assistance due to the large volume of trade. How should both parties cooperate? How should we adjust it as much as possible? This is indeed a problem worth discussing at present. Based on my personal feelings, there seem to be the following two methods for research:

(1) The financial industry should consolidate loans for ordinary goods and concentrate on investing in import and export trade. The method is: (1) Loans for various goods with speculative nature should be recalled and not lent to obtain a part of the funds that can be used. At the same time, prices can also fall considerably. (2) For loans for daily necessities, such as rice and coal, public organizations should come forward to raise funds to handle them. Private individuals or ordinary firms should not make pledges to silver firms and money changers to avoid the malpractices of manipulation and hoarding. (3) All financing related to legitimate import and export trade, regardless of exchange pledges or loans, should be undertaken as much as possible to provide convenience.

(2) The financial industry should set up special trust funds to be used for import and export trade. The method is: (1) The financial industry should collect special trust funds in accordance with trust investment methods for use in import and export trade. (2) This trust fund stipulates a certain guaranteed interest rate. A part of the profits from its use is obtained by import and export traders, a small part is obtained by the bank, and the rest is entirely obtained by the trustees. (3) This trust fund can be handled by one bank or jointly by several banks. (4) The method of financial institutions investing in import and export merchants can be negotiated at any time in accordance with the actual situation.

The above is only my personal temporary proposal, which seems like a fantasy. This matter is of great importance, and it seems that the financial industry and import and export merchants should have a corresponding organization to discuss it in the long term. I respectfully ask everyone for your guidance.

Wang Fuli: I would like to add an explanation to the third point: that is, the banking sector is not unwilling to lend to industry and commerce, but it differs depending on the location. The Shanghai area is almost a occupied area. The government is unwilling to lend at will and indirectly help others prosper, but in the interior, not only do they lend as usual, but the lending conditions are more favorable than before the war, and the interest rates are not increased. As far as I know, the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Office has allocated 30 million yuan from government banks to support industry and commerce; and the China Industrial Cooperative Society has recently borrowed 20 million yuan; in addition, industrialists and technicians who have practical plans to help increase production in the rear are loaned considerable funds after passing the examination, and even subsidies are added. These facts are obvious to everyone. I respectfully ask all enthusiastic entrepreneurs to bravely advance to the interior and not be confined to a corner of Shanghai!

I feel that the fourth point, while promoting foreign trade is quite important, if domestic goods are not sufficient, we must first start by enriching domestic goods. Just take cotton yarn as an example. There are 160 million spindles in the world, and the world population is 1.6 billion. On average, every ten people should have one spindle. My country has a population of 450 million, and according to this apportionment, there should be 45 million spindles, so that we will not suffer losses in the world. Before the July 7th Incident, my country also only had 2.8 million spindles, which was already far from enough. Now there are less than 700,000 spindles left. How serious is the problem of clothing? At this extraordinary time, traffic is very difficult, and it is by no means easy to import a large number of machines from foreign countries and set up many factories in the rear. We have no choice but to think of other ways to supplement it domestically. Currently, mechanically-assisted hand spinning is popular in the interior, such as 77 spinning, 31 spinning, Indian spinning, and Ye Jing spinning. They are springing up like mushrooms, which is caused by the situation and a good way to remedy it. I have worked with several comrades to conduct research and have recently developed a "super-large drawing small spinning machine" called the "New Farmer Type," which is now being manufactured in large quantities. The results are very good and orders are congested. In the future, there will be considerable subsidies for this industry. The details will be discussed in an article later. This is just an example of the insufficient domestic goods and does not mean that we can ignore [ ] all foreign trade.

Gao Shiheng: I think this issue is related to all parties to some extent. Generally speaking, all parties have difficulties. The government has its difficulties, the financial sector has its difficulties, the manufacturers have their difficulties, and the traders have their difficulties. We need to know that from the government's standpoint, Shanghai is not very important. However, from the perspective of Shanghai's 5 million people, Shanghai is the birthplace of talents and the financial center of the country. Future international trade cannot be separated from Shanghai. It is necessary to properly maintain Shanghai's industry! Being in this contradictory situation, our situation is very difficult. The cost of living is so high, which is not only the pain of some people, but the pain of all Shanghai people. Although [ ] some people become rich by buying and selling US dollars, their hearts are not necessarily happy.

Regarding the bank, we blame it. Why can foreign [ ] banks do things like exchange pledges and discounting? Why are Chinese banks unwilling to help us? But they also have their own difficulties. For example, as Mr. Yu just said, commercial banks cannot lend on a large scale due to the increase in demand deposits and the decrease in time deposits. As for state banks, the government does not want funds to remain in Shanghai. If you go to the interior to operate, you are very welcome! All banks will also give you as much convenience as possible!

Now national goods manufacturers cannot even talk about developing abroad! On this point, Mr. Zhu just said: "Because of foreign sales, prices have increased." But the reason for the surge in Shanghai is not because there is a shortage of goods, but entirely because of people's hearts. It must be known that there are 8 million overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia who welcome national goods, especially because of the foreign exchange relationship. Shanghai's goods are cheaper than those there. Therefore, the national goods trade there is as busy as [ ]. As long as we can endure hardship and be proactive, not only Southeast Asia needs our goods, but other countries also need our goods.

"We" cannot give up Shanghai because Shanghai is our base. But how can we develop foreign trade? The result is still financial cooperation. In countries around the world such as [ ] the United States and Japan, their overseas trade can be charged in large quantities, while the Chinese cannot. Isn't this a big impact? Why can they charge and we cannot? This is because they have the help of national banks and commercial banks, and we don't have it; even if we have it, it is very little. It must be known that the bills we receive are also the income of foreign exchange.

Foreign consumers welcome our Chinese goods as long as the quality meets the standards. But how can international trade be developed? All parties are related. The most important thing is that the financial sector and the industrial sector study a variable and beneficial method so that our international trade can flourish!

Wang Fuli: Recently, comrades in the national goods industry have repeatedly studied this issue and intend to achieve the following three things. I would like to reiterate them for your reference. (1) Please ask the government to ban futures trading to avoid speculation. (2) Please ask the government to issue 100 million yuan in exchange to provide working capital for Shanghai's industrial sector. (3) The law will sanction those who engage in futures trading and not be protected by law.

Ke Tianfu: Recently, the sales of national goods overseas have been expanding daily. However, my country's shipping industry is very backward. As for European and American ships, the number of ships coming to China is decreasing day by day due to the impact of the war. I am afraid that in the future, the situation of "there are goods but no ships to transport" may occur. I hope the government will pay due attention. Regarding the level of overseas Chinese investment in the motherland, the government should provide various conveniences and guidance. …

Epilogue

Chairman: Today's seminar started at 10:00 AM and it is now 4:00 PM. Thank you to the leaders from all walks of life for taking the time to attend and sharing your insights, sacrificing a long and valuable time. How to promote my country's international trade, in this state of domestic and foreign war, future events will depend on the changes in the future environment. Of course, no one can predetermine an immutable policy. However, in the grand theories expressed by the leaders of all circles today, we have a clear understanding of international trade and banks, foreign exchange, shipping costs, national goods merchants, import and export merchants, overseas markets, and government and people's cooperation. This is the necessary path to promote my country's international trade. Today's records, in addition to being published by the Shen Bao Economic Supplement on June 3rd and 10th, respectively, the Daily Economic Monthly published by our company will also publish a special issue on international trade. Shen Bao Jingzhuan and our company initiated this seminar to promote international trade, with the aim of soliciting opinions from all walks of life. We hope that leaders from all walks of life will work hard at any time to guide our country's international trade onto a smooth path, so that industry and commerce can have proper development, finance can have proper outlets, and the national economy and people's livelihood can benefit from it.

### Financial Pound Sterling Falls Again; Italian Participation in the War Becomes Clear; Indian Silver Trading is Remarkably Strong

An electric dispatch from New York on the 8th stated that the pound sterling exchange rate fell again due to the increasingly evident signs of Italian participation in the war in recent days, which triggered a small number of sellers. The opening price was 3 yuan 6 jiao 7 fen, but later recovered to 3 yuan 7 jiao 9 fen and a half due to active buying. However, the result was 3 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen, a drop of 7 fen compared to the previous day. The French franc exchange market also fell by 3 fen and a half following this.

Also, according to an electric dispatch from Bombay, the silver market situation was stable, but trading was remarkably strong. As a result, spot and June each rose by 3 annas, while July rose by 2 annas. A total of 300 orders were traded. In addition, both the British and American silver markets were closed, and there was no electric dispatch.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar is Tight Again

According to Dutch telecommunications, the sugar market picked up again yesterday because there were no ships available for loading in June, so people's minds were better. The spot price of No. 24 coarse white sugar was 70 yuan 3 jiao to 71 yuan at the local warehouse, and the price of foreign warehouse goods was 70 yuan to 71 yuan in the morning and still 71 yuan in the afternoon. However, transit goods were cheaper, with a spot price of 56 yuan 7 jiao and 57 yuan for orders on June 15th. Taikoo Crystal White B mark was 83 yuan, up 5 jiao. CW and CX marks are in short supply, and DY and HX marks also have few stocks, so there were no allocations. The H mark, raw sugar, and Dutch raw sugar both remained at the original price. The price of domestic refined sugar was 71 yuan, up 1 yuan. There was no change in domestic ice sugar. It is said that domestic sugar has been active in stomach clearance after the holiday, and there have been wholesale transactions.

### Coal: Smoke and Ash Stomach Clearance is Sluggish

The demand for various types of smoke coal and ash has been sluggish recently due to the warm weather. In addition, most factories in this port have switched to diesel and white coal to save fuel, resulting in an increasingly sluggish stomach clearance of smoke and ash. According to the dismantling prices of the industry, Kaiping No. 2 ash is 200 yuan per ton, Indian ash is 255 yuan, and Keelung ash is 180 yuan. The above are all prices from the warehouse, and street door shops add a small amount of handling fee.

### Food 無錫米價步高

Rice Price of Wuxi Rice Increases Step by Step

Due to scarce supply, rice prices in Wuxi have been rising step by step as hoarders purchase more. White japonica rice has reached thirty-seven yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), and japonica paddy rice is seventeen yuan and six jiao per dan (unit of weight). Furthermore, due to sunny weather during the rice planting season, there is a lack of rainfall. It is found that there are over 300,000 zu (unit of measure) of rice stored in various warehouses, which could originally have been used to supply the new harvest. However, a merchant has chartered to transport the rice out of the country. The county granary has limited stock. In the future, rice boats from the Wuyi production area may find it unprofitable to transport rice to Zhejiang Province and will instead turn to Wuxi. If the supply surges, rice prices may ease.

麵粉 Flour
陳貨有限、新粉出貨又微、致售價不一、零粉每包十四元五角、欲多購雖至十五元，亦難辦到、往年新貨上市、粉麥市必低落、目下市面失常、已入畸形狀態、

The supply of old flour is limited, and the output of new flour is also small, leading to varying selling prices. Retail flour is fourteen yuan and five jiao per bag. Even if willing to pay fifteen yuan for larger quantities, it is difficult to obtain. In previous years, the flour and wheat markets would fall when new products were released. Currently, the market is abnormal and has entered a distorted state.

小麥 Wheat
雖上市半月、而每日市上少至數十包、多至一二百包、民豐慶豐兩廠試過樣粉、造折尙佳、新杜小麥開過每包一百七十四斤價三十三元七角、客麥三十三元四五角、今歲收成雖勝往年、但行客對於門市鄕貨、產地販運河路雜費、限於資力、均審愼着手、錫地大小有十餘家、原料都仰本地收進、陳麥已絕跡、須待各路湧到、方有低落之望、（知）

Although it has been on the market for half a month, the daily supply is only a few dozen bags at a minimum, and one to two hundred bags at most. The Minfeng and Qingfeng factories have tested samples of the flour, and the processed quality is still good. New Du wheat was priced at thirty-three yuan and seven jiao per bag of 174 jin (unit of weight), and passenger wheat at thirty-three yuan, four or five jiao. Although this year's harvest is better than in previous years, merchants are cautious due to limited capital for transporting local goods from production areas to shops and river and road expenses. There are more than a dozen mills of varying sizes in Wuxi, all relying on local sources for raw materials. Old wheat has disappeared. A drop in price can only be expected when the supply from all regions surges. (Reported)

### The Transition of Woolen Cloth Sales

— Feng

After 1925, the woolen cloth sales suddenly shifted. Merchants from Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangdong saw a decline in procurement, mainly because they switched to purchasing from Hong Kong. Many of the demands from the Dalian merchants were re-exported goods because the woolen cloths had already been taxed in Shanghai. By shipping them to Dalian, they could claim the tax paid from the customs office. This was the so-called existing policy of storing goods for export. Now, this practice has been cancelled, thus, the representative offices of Dalian merchants in Shanghai are mostly closed. On the other hand, the purchasing power of Chongqing and Chengdu merchants is now stronger. Merchants from Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, Weihai and along the Yangtze River, especially those managed by people from the south, personally visit Shanghai to purchase goods twice a year, purchasing summer goods in the spring and winter goods in the autumn. The largest businesses managed by people from the north are Tianjin's Hua Xing and Dun Qing Long. (Tian Hua Xing's Shanghai office was founded by them.) After the goods are shipped to Tianjin, they are then sold to various smaller merchants.

In 1927, after the Northern Expedition united China and established the capital in Nanjing, woolen cloth sales shifted significantly again. The sales of merchants from Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Jinhua, Wenzhou, Ningbo and other inland regions, who had previously purchased small quantities, suddenly became brisk, especially those from Nanjing. At the same time, sales from the Northeast declined sharply. Many foreign firms established branches in Tianjin, so Tianjin merchants mostly placed orders directly, and fewer came to Shanghai to purchase goods. However, the sales of merchants from Changsha, Hankou, and Nanchang all improved. During this period, many South China merchant offices in Shanghai closed down, while the demand from merchants from Guizhou, Yunnan and Sichuan increased.

In 1932, after the January 28th Incident, woolen cloth sales naturally changed drastically again. Although the war ended soon after, northern merchants were hit hard. Merchants from the Northeast left Shanghai and went north. Famous northern merchant stores in Shanghai, such as Yong Feng Li, Yi Shun Heng, and Yi Shun Sheng, were reorganized one after another. The sales from the Northeast merchants suddenly dropped by half, but sales to the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Zhejiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei continued to increase. As a result, the average sales of woolen cloth did not decline and were even higher than before.

In 1937, when the Battle of Shanghai broke out on August 13th, the full-scale war of resistance began, progressing intensely. Due to inconvenient transportation, woolen cloth sales inevitably suffered a great blow. The postal services were intermittent. The delivery time was slow due to repeated transfers, so even though the merchants had sold out their stock and were eager to purchase goods from Shanghai, they were forced to do so due to the circumstances. Before Wuhan fell, many merchants resold goods via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Later, as the situation changed and the guerrilla areas expanded, water and land transportation became even more difficult. The sales of merchants across the country declined sharply. The merchant store Dachuan Tong closed down. Xiang Yu Gong was renamed Xiang Yu Gong. Yi He Yu was renamed Zhi Chang Xiang. Yong Feng Li was reorganized. New stores such as Bei Heng Mao and Yi Xin were established, forming a cycle of metabolism.

During this long war of resistance, woolen cloth sales decreased significantly in all regions. Recently, merchants from Peiping and Tianjin have become slightly more active, followed by merchants from Yunnan and Sichuan, then merchants from South China. Merchants from Wenzhou, Jinhua, and Ningbo in Zhejiang Province are also still active, but their sales have decreased by 60% compared to before the August 13th Incident. Considering the current situation, it is difficult for sales to merchants to improve. However, sales in this city have increased significantly due to the sharp increase in the population of the isolated island, exceeding more than half of the sales before the war. Therefore, the woolen cloth industry is now focusing on transactions in this city and temporarily does not seem to attach importance to business with merchants. (The End)

### A Study on the History of the Annexation of the Gorkhas (2)

The Gorkhas are short, strong, and fierce, with a population of about one million, and had no contact with China in ancient times. It was only in the ninth year of the Yongzheng reign that they began to offer local products with a gold leaf memorial. In the third month of the fifty-fifth year of the Qianlong reign, instigated by Shemarpa, the brother of the Panchen Lama of Tibet, they coveted the cultivation of Tibet and launched troops to invade the border. The Tangut troops could not resist, and urgently appealed to the central court. However, the imperial guards dispatched to suppress them, Generals Ba Zhong, E Hui, and Cheng De, mediated a bribed peace, secretly allowing the Tibetan Khambo (high ranking religious figures) to privately promise an annual tribute of 150,000 taels of gold. They held back their troops and did not fight, falsely reporting the Gorkhas as surrendered. They then persuaded the Gorkha chiefs to pay tribute and receive official titles. In July, the Gorkhas sent people to Tibet to pay tribute, and sent a letter to the resident minister in Tibet, requesting to continue the previous agreement. E Hui, fearing that the matter would be exposed, suppressed the information. The following year, the annual tribute to Tibet was once again not paid, and the Gorkha chiefs, using the debt as an excuse, once again invaded the Zhaxilhunbu area of Tibet. When the resident minister in Tibet, Bao Tai, heard of the arrival of the invaders, he moved the Panchen Lama to the front of Tibet, exaggerated the strength of the invaders, and requested to move the Dalai Lama to Xining and the Panchen Lama to Taining, intending to abandon the Tibetan territory to the invaders. The Lamas, Ji Zhong and Zhacang, then falsely claimed that the auspicious goddess did not favor battle, and the morale of the people collapsed. The invaders looted Zhaxilhunbu, and all of Tibet was greatly shocked! The two Grand Lamas sent urgent memorials. At this time, E Hui was the Governor-General of Sichuan, and Cheng De was the General of Sichuan, and all the blame was placed on Ba Zhong. The Emperor ordered the two to go to Tibet to suppress the invasion, but they advanced slowly.

### A Chronicle of Mr. Ding's Congee Gathering

— Zheng Yimei

In the past, there were many scholars who loved congee, such as Lu Cheng's chestnut congee, Lu You's taro congee, Dongpo's light congee, and Xiangshan's congee. There were also those who cooked congee with peach blossoms, simmered it with plum stamens, added shredded cinnamon and ginger, or used glutinous rice and beans. My predecessor, Mr. Ding Zhonghu, had profound knowledge of ancient culture and especially loved the "double-bow rice" (referring to rice grains). He promoted his fondness for it by hosting congee gatherings. Every Monday evening, he would hold one, and never missed a single one for decades. His persistent spirit is truly admirable. Last Monday, I also had the opportunity to participate. Young and old were gathered, men and women sat together. There were painters, calligraphers, poets, lyricists, medical practitioners, and connoisseurs. It can be said that there were many talented people. Guests were required to sign their names in a register, and their addresses and dates of birth were also listed in detail. At the beginning of the register, there were rules which stated: "In this Monday gathering, we do not value empty formalities. We do not greet guests upon arrival, nor do we see them off upon departure. There is no distinction between host and guest. There is no fixed seating arrangement. We value honesty and simplicity. Congee is served instead of rice, and water is served instead of tea. We chat about the past and present, and quietly appreciate calligraphy and paintings. We do not speak of right and wrong, nor do we discuss official matters. We act freely and forget ourselves. Our style is simple and detached. Our friendship is based on righteousness, and that is all. To display rich food and elaborate arrangements, to be insincere inwardly and artificially outward, to be concerned with self-interest, and to look at each other with hostility, is the way of worldly friendships, which we reject." It was modeled after Sima Wengong's sincerity gathering and borrowed some of its wording. The room was decorated with bronze Buddhas and porcelain pots, which were colorful and full of ancient charm. While we were talking and laughing, the servants came to set the table. There were two tables, and everyone sat around them. There were eight dishes, all of which were simple and elegant, making one imagine immortal sesame seeds. Mr. Zhong and I sat at the same table. He said that he had not eaten fish or meat for a long time. If he ate meat at will, his blood vessels would harden and his blood pressure would rise. It was a slow poisoning. Alas, how can the people of the world not abstain from gluttony? It is best to eat vegetables, such as soybeans, tomatoes, and cabbage, which are very nutritious. He eats more than ten oranges and bananas every morning and noon. He would rather eat less congee and rice than give up fruits and gourds. This is the way to health. Also, too much salt can stimulate the kidneys. Eating too much salt can gradually reduce the function of the kidneys. Lack of nutrition can make people thin and weak, but excessive nutrition is also harmful, causing people to age and die early. As the saying goes, too much is as bad as too little. I said that one night's conversation is better than ten years of books. Mr. Zhong smiled. When we left, the shops were all closed and the sounds of the city were gradually quiet.

### Recommendations for Several Summer Fabrics

— Junmei

Summer fabrics should first focus on being light and airy. However, this naturally allows imported goods to dominate the entire summer fabric market. In fact, domestic silk also has these characteristics. At a time when everything is rising in price, and the price of each foot of silk fabric is more than two or three yuan, I think Sheng Textile is still worth recommending:

電力紡 (Dianlifang/Electric Spun Silk) Dianlifang is the only new product from Sheng Textile in recent years. In the past, its raw materials used factory silk for both warp and weft, so it was tightly woven, thin, clean, smooth, and beautiful, making it the crown of all silks from Sheng Textile. After the war, due to the high price of factory silk, local silk has been used for both warp and weft. The appearance seems to have deteriorated somewhat, but its lightness, airiness, washability, and durability have not diminished. It is most suitable for making long and short shirts and trousers, undershirts, and the like. The width is 22 inches, and the price per foot is at most one yuan and two or three jiao, which is much cheaper than crepe de chine, Indian silk, etc.

光扣紡 (Guangkoufang/Bright Buckled Silk) Secondly, there is Guangkoufang. Dianlifang is woven by electric machines, while Guangkoufang is entirely woven by wooden machines and manual labor. Therefore, there is really no difference in quality and texture between the two. However, the evenness and smoothness of the Guangkoufang silk surface are not as beautiful as that of Dianlifang. The advantage of Sheng Textile is that the texture becomes finer and denser with each wash, and the color becomes more elegant with each wash. Guangkoufang is superior to Dianlifang in this regard. The width is about the same as Dianlifang, and the price per foot is about one yuan. A family of four or five can buy a bolt of Guangkoufang for fifty yuan, which is more than enough for summer clothes. There are also various stripes and checks, with quiet and elegant patterns, which are especially suitable for women.

生紡 (Shengfang/Raw Spun Silk) Wearing silk clothes in the summer seems to feel sticky when sweating. Although boiled silk does not have this problem, its high price is prohibitive. Then Shengfang can at least make up for this deficiency. Shengfang is made of finer warp and weft stripes. Although the texture and weight are not as heavy as the above two, it is not as fine as coarse summer cloth and wanzai cloth without being boiled. The price per foot is only five or six jiao. Although the width is narrower, only one foot and five inches, it is as cool and comfortable as boiled silk when used to make shirts.

### On Mosquito Nets

— Shen Xishen

As summer arrives, it is the season for mosquitoes to wreak havoc. Especially when sleeping at night, mosquitoes make a buzzing sound in your ear, which not only disturbs your dreams but also sucks your blood and spreads germs. It is truly a hateful little thing and a threat to human health.

To eliminate this threat, the only thing to do is hang a mosquito net over the bed. Put down the mosquito net when sleeping, so that mosquitoes cannot get in. You can sleep soundly inside the net.

The function of mosquito nets differs somewhat between Shanghai and inland areas. In Shanghai, mosquito nets are used purely to keep out mosquitoes, so they are rarely used except in summer and autumn. Because it is thought that they hinder air circulation and are not conducive to hygiene during sleep, most styles are western-style dome mosquito nets. They can be rolled up high during the day when not in use, and lowered over the entire bed before going to sleep at night. However, in most inland areas, people hang them on the bed year-round. That is our country's traditional style; rectangular and suitable for the size of the bed, with two pages in the front, like curtains, for easy entry and exit. In addition to protecting against mosquitoes in the summer, inland areas usually have old-fashioned houses. Some houses do not have ceilings, and the tiles are exposed, with dust flying around. Some walls are thin, and sunlight and rain may invade through the cracks. At night, the entire bed is protected by the mosquito net. Unlike the western-style houses in Shanghai, the walls are so thick that closing the doors and windows can isolate the room from the outside world, so there is no need to hang mosquito nets on the bed.

The materials of mosquito nets are usually made of foreign gauze, summer cloth, bamboo cloth, zhuluo gauze, etc. for Chinese style and mostly use zhuluo gauze for Western style; of course, zhuluo gauze is the most suitable because it is cool, breathable, and hygienic!

### Leather Rafts Navigating the Upper Reaches of the Yellow River

— Haizhiji

Leather rafts are the most common form of water transportation in the Northwest. Due to geographical reasons, the Northwest is not suitable for farming but is suitable for animal husbandry. They can most easily obtain things from animals. They use cowhide or sheepskin to make navigational tools. The method of making leather rafts is very simple, but the process takes a considerable amount of time. The first step is to soak the cowhide or sheepskin bags in oil for a long time, then tightly tie the heads, tails, and limbs, and inflate them with air. Several, a dozen, or dozens or hundreds of them are woven into a flat, square surface, and wooden frames are placed on top. Passengers or goods can be carried on the wooden frames. The heaviest of these leather rafts can carry more than 10,000 jin (unit of weight).

Each leather raft is operated by sailors. The number of sailors depends on the size of the raft. The sailors are called "bashis" (craftsmen), who are responsible for the oars at the front and rear. One of them is the leader, called "nashishi" (person in charge). The leader must have traveled the rivers for a long time, be proficient in water skills, and be an alert and decisive person. Most of these coolies are Hui people from Hezhou, Gansu. They do not eat opium, are physically strong, have a sense of responsibility, and are able to undertake this arduous task. Among them, there is a type called "xia bashis" (gorge craftsmen), who are even more proficient in water skills and familiar with water patterns. Originally, the Yellow River passes through Gansu Province. Sixty to seventy li (unit of distance) from Lanzhou, there is a "Great Gorge" sixty li long. The river surface is very narrow, and the water is rapid with huge beaches and nearly right-angle turns. As a result, a type of sailor who specializes in navigating the dangerous waters of the "Great Gorge" has emerged, called "xia bashis" (gorge craftsmen).

Leather rafts sailing on the Yellow River rely entirely on water patterns in calm waters. They choose the location of the main stream of the water pattern to navigate the raft on. Because the water of the main pattern is deeper and faster, there is no danger of running aground. Therefore, leather rafts dislike wind and rain the most. When the water patterns are disrupted, the leather raft can only stop moving forward. This backward means of transportation is indeed too weak to resist the oppression of nature.

Tianchu Recipe (17)

### (30) Cold Crab Roe (One of the Best Summer Dishes)

Ingredients: Soft tofu, fresh duck eggs, MSG, vinegar or spicy soy sauce

Preparation: Wash the soft tofu with cold boiled water, remove the edges, boil the fresh duck eggs in their shells, remove the shells, and then beat them. Mix with the soft tofu (the taste is even better if only the egg yolks are used). Add some MSG or Tianchu soy sauce extract, then add vinegar or spicy soy sauce. The taste is no different from crab roe, hence the name "Better than Crab Roe". It is very suitable for summer side dishes and is also very economical.

### Raisin Pudding

Ingredients: Raisins, flour, milk, lemon juice, white butter, white sugar, MSG

Method: Chop the butter into small pieces, mix with flour and raisins, add some milk, crystal MSG, lemon juice, and white sugar, and knead into a dough. Wrap it tightly with a clean cloth sprinkled with dry flour. Simmer for two and a half hours. Serve with fresh butter for an even better taste.

### A Week's Economic Menu

— Ms. Huaying

Today is the fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar, the traditional Dragon Boat Festival, which is another day for eating. As the saying goes: "Buy a yellow croaker for the Dragon Boat Festival." So eating yellow croaker on the Dragon Boat Festival is indispensable. Originally, the price of yellow croaker was relatively cheap, but in the past two days, because it was near the festival, the fishmongers hoarded the fish and raised the price. Of course, it will be even more expensive today. But because it is indispensable for the festival, one has to bear the pain and eat it. For families with a large number of people, buying a large yellow croaker and cutting it into two sections, adding some pickled vegetables, one bowl in the morning and one bowl at night, is enough to get by. To be more elaborate, then use sweet and sour and wine lees methods to make it more flavorful. To be even more elaborate, then debone it and make fish soup, add diced ham, diced bamboo shoots, sliced mushrooms, and amaranth. Sprinkle a little pepper when eating, and it will naturally be delicious. If you like soup, a ham and yellow croaker slice soup is so delicious. As for other meat and vegetable dishes, everything is expensive during the festival, but you can't not eat them. If there really is a Zhong Jinshi in this world, I would like to see him eat little devils.

### The Violet Hermitage Is Not a Grass

— Zhou Shoujuan

In the autumn of the year of Ji Mao (1939), I participated in the Shanghai Chinese-Western Flower Show with the chrysanthemums and small potted plants I had cultivated and was fortunate enough to win the Grand Prize, the Sir Peter Grantham Silver Cup. I wrote this poem to commemorate the occasion:

Every day, the Green Chapter pays tribute to the Eastern Emperor,
Do not let the wind aunt damage the fragrant flowers,
There is nowhere to find the Peach Garden outside the world,
Ten thousand flowers like the sea, deep in the eyes.

Inches of cinnabar dust stain the clear bones,
Following others, bowing and raising, the meaning is hard to calm,
One flower and one tree under the west window,
Not a beautiful eyebrow is also pleasing.

Rare flowers bloom brilliantly from Suzhou,
The crown of all flowers, the first class,
Let the yellow flowers occupy the chief seat,
The pink and green all lower their heads.

Occupying the head of the Ao Turtle, I smile,
The flowers and plants in Wu Palace, the eyebrows of E'e,
I want him, the overseas bearded guest,
To look at Guo Tuotuo with new eyes.

In the late spring of the year of Geng Chen (1940), I participated in the Chinese-Western Flower Show with aquascapes and flower and tree bonsai and won the Grand Prize again. Four poems:

The rosy clouds are steaming and the flowers are like embroidery,
Everywhere in Jiangcheng, spring is formed by itself,
It is absolutely pitiful to gather,
There is one person missing before the flower. (During the annual meeting in the autumn of last year, Mr. Chen Xuyuan came to appreciate the flowers with Mr. Zhang Yijun and his wife, and they laughed and talked happily. Unexpectedly, half a year later, there was a separation between the underworld. Thinking of it, I was in tears!)

Half a year of hard work is not in vain,
This time, I won the championship again,
But I am sad that the rivers and mountains are broken,
I can't bear to see some mountains in the pot. (There is a potted mountain in the exhibits, with a solitary cliff hanging, with flowing water below, and a boat returning to the shore in the reeds, as if I heard the sound of rowing. The viewers praised it, saying that it was full of poetic and pictorial meaning.)

The road to survival after the tribulation is not exhausted,
Watering the garden, I love the fragrant bushes,
I hope you will not despise the idle flowers and plants,
All nations worship at the foot. (I dare not boast of the small way of cultivating flowers. I only participate in international grand events and achieve success, which seems to be enough to bring glory to the country. This is what I am proud of.)

Small grasses and secluded flowers are charming,
With a calm mind, I forget greed, anger, and ignorance,
If I can see the prosperous world again,
The flower country is willing to be a non-rebellious minister. (The world is chaotic and I don't know where it will go. If I can get to the end of my troubles and see the prosperous world again, then I will spend my old age in my hometown, engaging in the life of an old gardener.)

### Sleep and Bedbugs

— Rulai

Sleep is as important as clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Many human ailments are often caused by lack of sleep. In the summer, considering the situation on the isolated island, most of the houses are small and crowded, and it is as hot as a steamer. Sleep is inevitably greatly hindered, so in the summer, one should give up gambling at night or engage in useless pastimes and go to bed early.

The most affected by sleep is the disturbance of bedbugs. Middle and lower-class families cannot avoid having bedbugs. The harder the working class, the more serious the problem. It is a pity that after working hard all day, are they even deprived of the right to sleep that is endowed by nature at night? Thinking from another perspective, we humans are the kings of animals, especially in this era of science. How can we deal with tiny bedbugs and still be helpless? I am afraid that the general scientific community has ignored this trivial problem too much. Perhaps they live in foreign-style houses and cannot feel this pain, and they are unwilling to put in the effort to study it.

Recently, I have tried a strong and effective medicinal water, which was invented by Dr. Sun Kejin. As long as the medicinal liquid is sprayed into the bed frame, palm mat, or wall crevices, it will immediately annihilate all adult insects and larvae in less than five minutes. Now they are sending many employees to visit families everywhere to conduct on-site experiments. After gaining the trust of users, they then promote their products to them. This method is also very commendable.

Spring and Autumn

### New Conditions for Renting a Garret

— Buddha

Yesterday, while waiting for a tram at a certain tram stop, I looked up and saw a newly posted, bright red rental notice on a utility pole. The original text was roughly as follows:

"Now available for rent: one garret, spacious and well-lit. Those wishing to rent are limited to a maximum of two or three people and must provide a guarantor to be considered."

After reading this, I couldn't help but feel a bit doubtful. If those wishing to rent are limited to a maximum of two or three people, I wonder what the minimum number of people is. Is it merely renting the space without allowing anyone to live there? And it also states that a guarantor is required, meaning that those wishing to rent the garret need not only a guarantor but also a deposit, like a tea server in a hotel who must provide both a person and money as collateral, which is quite strict.

Old second landlords typically have two common conditions for their tenants: one is that they don't rent to those with young children, and the other is that they don't rent to those without family. I think these two conditions are already quite "petty," and there are inevitable contradictions. If one has family, how can they be prevented from having children? If they have children, it violates their rules. Does this mean the second landlord will issue an eviction notice as soon as a child is born, or will the second landlord not allow them to raise the child? I think the second landlord must have a good solution.

Now, this rental notice is even more perfectly sound. It states a maximum of two or three people, but two or three is already the maximum, clearly indicating that it's only for one person. This is because one person will certainly not have young children, which aligns perfectly with the condition of not renting to those with young children. As for requiring a guarantor, the deposit amount, although not specified, must be considerable. The intention of requiring a deposit is probably due to the second landlord fearing that the tenant will lack rent money. However, with a guarantor, there's no need to worry about a shortage of rent.

If the guarantor is not there to guarantee the rent, then what is the guarantor guaranteeing? Are they guaranteeing that they won't become robbers? Are they guaranteeing that they won't take a wife or concubine? Are they guaranteeing that they won't have an affair? Assuming they have an affair or take a wife or concubine, they will inevitably have children, causing trouble for the second landlord. Therefore, a guarantor is indispensable. The second landlord's original conditions already seem the most demanding, and now these two additional conditions are added, seemingly making them even more thorough. Indeed, it's not easy being a second landlord. If so, I think a second landlord who is so worried should quickly tear down the rental notice and not be a second landlord. Otherwise, besides these four conditions, other unexpected dangers may arise.

### Houses Without Landlords

— Merchant

In the past three years, the repeated instances of rent disputes, other than ending up in court, seem to have no other proper solutions to achieve a normal resolution. Although the French Concession authorities recently have regulations prohibiting the collection of sub-rents, they still cannot regulate the height of rents because of various reasons, such as location, the newness or age of the houses, whether water is supplied, and others, making it impossible to price and mark them like goods.

In the past, the extremes of rent disputes were no more than the following two methods: the main landlord dealing with the second landlord was demolishing and rebuilding; the second landlord dealing with the tenant was selling the lease and changing the owner. The former is well known through the lawsuit between the Women's Bank and Qingyu Lane, and the latter is too numerous to list. However, after the lease of a house is sold, the new owner denies the transfer, which is truly an innovation. Yesterday, this newspaper carried an advertisement from lawyer Xuan Zhendong representing all the tenants of No. 9 Yingchunfang, Daxin Street, first telling us such a strange thing, the original text of which is as follows:

"Now, according to the aforementioned parties, they stated that their houses were leased from Hong Defan. Mr. Hong suddenly moved out of No. 9 and sold the lease to Dalu Company, forcibly demanding relocation, cutting off the electricity and water. The parties then sought legal remedies. Since Mr. Hong avoided appearing in court, the lawyer representing Dalu Company also denied the transfer. For several months, the parties have had to deposit the rent in the court and the Four Banks Savings Society. Therefore, we commissioned representatives to urge the person in charge of the house to come and collect it quickly to complete the procedures..."

From the phrases "forcibly demanding relocation, cutting off the electricity and water, the parties then sought legal remedies," it seems that this dispute is quite serious. However, "Mr. Hong avoided appearing in court, and the lawyer of Dalu Company also denied the transfer" makes people feel that this dispute is unfathomable, and it is clear that there must be twists and turns in it. We don't need to waste too much brainpower to speculate for the time being. In these few days, even if Hong does not come forward, the original landlord will definitely come out to reveal this mystery.

However, as a tenant, the author cannot help but have some complaints about this matter! For all disputes, everyone may as well make public announcements, and add the reasons for increasing the rent. The acts of renovating and selling the lease are not allowed! If a house has no owner, it is even more perplexing, as the saying goes, "can't grab the braid." But on the other hand, it is also the easiest to solve. If the tenants don't want to live in the house for free, they should simply donate the monthly rent to a charity and keep the receipt for future reference.

Hawthorne Case

### The Fate of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 1 "A Very Pretty Lady!"

There is a short wall in front of the house, with short iron fences with spikes installed on the wall. The door is made of flowered iron bars, with spikes at the top, all painted light green. As soon as we stepped into this iron bar door, we saw a small flower garden on the left, about eight or nine feet deep and more than fifteen feet wide. Some flowering plants were planted in the garden, among which several light red monthly roses were unusually small and thin. After being seduced by the night rain, they bloomed gracefully, both lovely and pitiful. Several porcelain pots are very delicate, but they are casually placed on the ground, and the surrounding of the porcelain surface has been splashed with mud, which shows that the owner of the house is not very interested in the work of seasonal flowers. On the right side, there is also a small open space, separated by short winter green trees, but most of it has been occupied by the doorman's small guardhouse, plus another palm tree, in fact, there is not much "space" left.

As I followed Hawthorne up the cement path where the morning sun was just beginning to dry, Inspector Ni Jinshou, a tall, slender man in a black silk padded robe, had already come out to greet us from inside.

"Mr. Hawthorne, Mr. Bao, thank you for your trouble. This matter is very strange—seems a bit troublesome."

Hawthorne smiled and replied: "In that case, I can't help but thank you first. You've given me another opportunity to broaden my horizons."

Ni Jinshou shook hands with us again, leading us up the three cement steps. Hawthorne's gaze wandered on the ground and around, showing that he was already using his superior observational skills. I saw some mud floating on the cement path, which was obviously washed over from the adjacent flower garden by the rain. (10)

### Dragon Boat Festival

— Zichang

"Clear payment by the first three festivals, no delays allowed," is the first settlement checkpoint of the year. May in the Gregorian calendar passes by languidly like a disease. In addition to money and accounts, there is also a mental "耿耿此懷" account, how can one avoid being vulgar!

May (lunar calendar), pomegranate flowers shine red, it's the season! The whole world is fighting for new life in red blood. Moreover, the Dragon Boat Festival is also a festival of insect birth and death, relying on our efforts to eliminate them. Although "worms die in soy sauce," it must conform to natural selection; and rectifying the soy sauce jar so that it no longer produces maggots is also a fundamental and urgent construction for all people after eliminating insect pests. In fact, it is more important than clearing accounts. "Things must rot before insects can breed" may be a cliche, but it is also a profound truth.
