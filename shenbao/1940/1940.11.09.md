### Gannady: Strong Supporter of Aiding Britain

Boston: U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Gannady, met with reporters here yesterday. Having witnessed the British Air Force's victory, he believes aircraft production is the most important defense measure. While supporting continued aid to Britain, he opposes U.S. entry into the war. Gannady expressed pessimism about immediate peace overseas and dismissed rumors of his resignation as unfounded. He plans to vacation in California and Florida and will return to London within 48 hours if needed. (Reuters, 8th)

### Pacific Joint Defense Issue: Agreement Established Between the U.S., Britain, and Australia; U.S. Navy to Use British and Australian Bases; Possible Blockade Against Japan in the Far East

London: Reliable sources claimed last night that Britain, the U.S., and Australia have agreed on a Pacific defense agreement to enable immediate emergency action. The core of the agreement concerns defense cooperation in the Pacific and the use of naval bases. However, whether the formidable Singapore naval base is included is unclear. The Pacific joint defense issue has been discussed extensively by U.S. President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, British Ambassador Lothian, Australian Minister Richard, and others, and is now nearing completion. Officials here are silent on the details of the new agreement. However, it is believed to stipulate that Britain, the U.S., and Australia mutually use each other's naval and air bases in the Pacific. This determination for joint action to resist continued aggression is prompted by Japan's signing of a military alliance with the Axis powers. According to the agreement, Britain, the U.S., and Australia, in case of emergency in the Far East, can impose a long-range naval blockade against Japan. (Associated Press, 8th)

Washington: It is expected that officials will announce details within days regarding the U.S. and Britain forming a common front in the Far East. Details must remain strictly confidential. However, informed sources believe that Singapore and Darwin are within the scope of the common front. The U.S. Navy will control the territorial waters of the Eastern Pacific. It is pointed out here that Britain can deploy a large naval fleet in European waters. Additionally, Britain may obtain multiple U.S. destroyers. It is now openly acknowledged that U.S.-British negotiations have been underway for several weeks. Therefore, Roosevelt's and Gannady's assurances that there are no secret agreements between the U.S. and Britain have now been proven to be electioneering tactics. Furthermore, the U.S. is simultaneously negotiating with Mexico to discuss U.S. use of Mexican naval and air bases. It is also learned that the oil issue between the U.S. and Mexico will also be discussed in these negotiations. (Haitong, 8th)

British and American Officials Remain Tight-Lipped

London: Regarding reports today that Britain, the U.S., and Australia have reached a general agreement on Pacific cooperation, officials here have no information. It is claimed that some time ago, officials from the U.S. State Department, the Australian Minister, and the British Ambassador exchanged opinions, but this exchange was entirely informal and only for mutual clarification. (Reuters, 8th)

Washington: The State Department last night denied reports from London that the U.S., Britain, and Australia have established an agreement on joint Pacific defense. A State Department spokesperson pointed out that diplomatic representatives from Britain and Australia had discussed the Pacific situation with Secretary of State Hull. However, according to the spokesperson, Secretary of State Hull refused to discuss details with them at the time. Hull has repeatedly told reporters that the U.S. has never made any commitments to British or Australian diplomatic representatives. However, there is widespread criticism here regarding rumors that the U.S. has already established an agreement with Britain and Australia in the Pacific, believing that such an agreement may already be in place. It is generally believed that this agreement includes the U.S. Navy borrowing British and Australian bases in the Far East, so that if Britain and the U.S. are attacked in the Pacific, the three countries can take joint action. (Taiwan Associated Press, 8th)

Anti-Aggression Policy Remains Consistent; U.S. Attitude Toward Japan to Become More Assertive

Washington: The world is delighted by President Roosevelt's re-election, except for the three Axis powers. This demonstrates that the Axis powers acknowledge that their acts of aggression cannot gain the sympathy of the four hemispheres. Even if the election results were different, such sympathy would not be forthcoming. However, if Wilkie had been elected, the Axis powers in Europe and Asia would have exploited the period of temporary pause in administrative handover between the current and new administrations in January to advance their schemes. Now that Roosevelt has been re-elected, the firmness displayed by U.S. policy in recent months will continue uninterrupted. It appears that Secretary of State Hull will remain in office. His views on aggression and the new order in Europe and Asia have been thoroughly expressed during the election campaign. The Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Suma, said that U.S. policy toward Japan should be revised. People here, regardless of party affiliation, believe this to be the case. However, the revisions to U.S. policy toward Japan should not be in the direction indicated by the Tokyo spokesperson. If Japan takes new aggressive actions, U.S. policy may be revised in another direction. Suma claims that U.S. policy is unfriendly to Japan. Observers here ask when Japanese policy has ever been friendly to U.S. interests since Japan began pursuing its national policy with weapons in 1921. People here are still closely monitoring Japan's withdrawal from Southern China to determine its underlying meaning. Some commentators suggest that the Japanese military will redeploy to the Dutch East Indies. However, those with a more moderate view believe that Japan cannot currently undertake such a large-scale risky operation because what Japan has bitten off in China is more than it can chew. It must now spit out some to avoid suffering from long-term lockjaw in China. (Reuters, 7th)

### Roosevelt Returns to the White House; Convenes Important Meetings; Discusses Steps to Intensify Aid to China and Britain

Washington: President Roosevelt returned victoriously here yesterday from his Hyde Park estate and immediately began discussions with the National Defense Committee. The President's discussions with the National Defense Committee lasted two hours and fifteen minutes. It is believed that this meeting has historical value, as the U.S. may immediately intensify aid to Britain. It is also believed that the proposal to ship 12,000 American aircraft to Britain may be put forward for commencement. After the meeting concluded, the President immediately convened a high-level meeting to decide what kind of military equipment could be sold without hindering the U.S.'s own self-defense procedures. It is believed that this committee is considering the President's proposal to ship 12,000 American military aircraft. Observers believe that President Roosevelt's first official announcement upon returning to Washington will be to accelerate the supply of military equipment to Britain. Some sources believe that the President is also determined to take similar action to increase aid to China. President Roosevelt, accompanied by Mrs. Roosevelt, returned to Washington yesterday, beaming with happiness because he had achieved an honor never before seen in American history. He told reporters, "Although we have returned here later than expected, we are very happy. You should know that we love rural life very much, but as far as cities are concerned, we love living in Washington more than any other city." (Associated Press, 8th)

Washington: Just hours after President Roosevelt returned to the U.S. capital yesterday, U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Gannady, and Secretary of State Hull visited him. It is rumored that the British purchasing delegation in the U.S. is currently meeting with the U.S. President, raising speculation that the President is now formally considering continuing aid to Britain. (Reuters, 8th)

### New U.S. Government to Take Office in January; Secretary of State Hull Expected to Remain; Interior Secretary Ickes Announces Resignation

Washington: The new U.S. government will take office in January. Rumors about the new government's composition are circulating here. Interior Secretary Ickes announced his resignation last night, and it is expected that other cabinet members will follow in Ickes' footsteps within the year. General attention is now focused on the State Department. When asked about his future, Secretary of State Hull responded very cautiously. However, it is believed that President Roosevelt will certainly retain him. It is known that Hull is eager to step down and may use old age as an excuse to retire. However, just months ago, Hull stated that in times of crisis, he was willing to make any necessary sacrifices for the national interest. Therefore, it is generally speculated that Hull may remain in office to ensure the consistency of U.S. policy. (Reuters, 8th)

Washington: U.S. Interior Secretary Ickes, who has served since March 4, 1933, announced last night that he has resigned so that President Roosevelt will have the freedom to allocate cabinet positions if he needs to change cabinet members. This is the only reason for his resignation. As for Mr. Roosevelt's re-election, he is very pleased. Ickes is 66 years old and has been practicing law. He was initially a staff member of a Chicago newspaper and has been dedicated to municipal reform politics since the age of 23. During the First European War, he went to France with the 35th Division of the American Expeditionary Forces to work for the YMCA. (Reuters, 8th)

### Roosevelt and Wilkie to Broadcast on Monday

Washington: News from last night indicates that President Roosevelt will deliver two radio addresses on Armistice Day on Monday. The first is scheduled for 11:00 AM, and the second for 3:30 PM. (Associated Press, 8th)

New York: The defeated Republican presidential candidate, Wilkie, announced last night that he will deliver a several-hour address to the nation next Monday night to articulate the policies that he and his countless followers will implement during President Roosevelt's third term. The address is scheduled for 11:30 PM (i.e., 11:30 AM on Tuesday in Shanghai). (Associated Press, 8th)

Washington: The Chairman of the U.S. Republican Committee, Martin, issued a statement yesterday, stating briefly that the Republican Party is prepared to support Roosevelt, but on the condition that it does not betray the various principles issued during the Republican campaign. The Republican Party recognizes Wilkie's leadership and is not influenced by conservatives such as Hoover and Landon. Martin hopes that the Republican Party will gain a leading position in the 1941 congressional elections. (Haitong, 8th)

Editorial

### This Year's Winter Relief

As time passes, the north wind gradually strengthens. There was a period of high pressure that once arrived, and many have already frozen to death. Fortunately, it is still deep autumn, which has turned mild again. However, the weather yesterday was a glimpse of early winter. Recalling last year's several cold spells, reports of deaths from extreme cold on the roadside were endless. Subsequently, the Charity Federation came forward to organize emergency relief, distributing bread daily at dusk to provide heat from the food to ward off the external cold. During the distribution, one saw the old supporting the young, and countless heads jostling. It is conceivable that the number of people awaiting relief and the effectiveness of the effort ensured that quite a few survived. This year's high prices and the general difficulty of life are certainly incomparable to last year. As a result, the number of displaced people on the streets and their miserable plight are even worse than before. And when one thinks of the expression, "Sitting in the sun on a sunny eave, warmth filling the robe," one the joy, the other the anxiety of being in the same harsh winter, the difference between joy and sorrow could not be more different. Therefore, if we must wait for a certain number of people to starve and freeze to death before thinking about relief, is this the intention of a benevolent person? Can they not worry and be concerned in advance?

Relief is a beautiful name, but it is often difficult to maintain consistently. Everyone has a heart of compassion, but they cannot see it in action. If one must wait for the name to be verified before being willing to make the effort for relief, then one will be searching for dried fish in the market. Therefore, those with good intentions should simply make good wishes. Good deeds should certainly be selective, but good names need not be for oneself. As for those who doubt that good deeds cannot be fully realized, keep their purses tightly closed, have no heart for compassion, and forget their duty to help each other in the community, this is not what the human heart should do. Therefore, in the past, there was "breaking money for merit," only seeking one's own charity, not caring about the reality of the situation. However, those who handle charitable deeds should do their best to live up to the wishes of the donors and ensure that "funds are not wasted and that things are practical." Be careful not to use the name of good to achieve evil, and do not use improper personnel and accumulate corruption. It is difficult to raise donations, and it is difficult to organize relief. Those with some experience in relief work all share this feeling.

Speaking of winter relief, it is emergency relief. Since it is called emergency relief, it should address what is urgent. If one must wait until the matter is at hand to launch it, then there will be people who freeze to death, and there will be people who starve to death. Historically, winter relief has included shelters to provide food and clothing, treat illnesses, and break addictions, so that displaced people have a place to stay and are free from the danger of wind and snow. This is a good deed. But it requires a lot of money, first. It is not easy to find a vacant place in the isolated city to set up a factory for accommodation, second. It must be organized and led by a group, third. And often limited by the number of places and funding, there is a feeling of admitting a few is better than admitting none, fourth. In addition, there is the distribution of clothing and rice tickets. Clothing tickets can be used to get clothes to keep warm, but when there is no food, the beard prefers to endure the cold rather than the hunger and pawns the clothing. This shows that food is very important. Therefore, there is the distribution of rice tickets. However, even if the very poor have rice tickets, they still have nothing to cook with, and they cannot eat it raw. Therefore, there is cooked relief. Cooked relief is difficult to organize. First, order is not easy to maintain. Second, the porridge must be thick enough to stand chopsticks in. Third, the porridge must be cooked before dawn and wait to be distributed. Unless the person in charge has enthusiasm and perseverance, it is often difficult to achieve success. It is not easy to find people to distribute porridge, and it is also difficult to find places to distribute porridge. Therefore, the Charity Federation distributed bread last year and first added ginger soup, because bread cannot ward off the cold like hot porridge, and it can be slightly adjusted with hot soup. In addition, it is better to distribute porridge tickets and meal tickets than to distribute rice tickets. Porridge tickets have long been issued by the Chinese Life-Saving Association, designating several porridge shops to provide porridge upon presentation of the ticket. However, meal tickets have not yet been organized. Even if there are organizers, they sell plain rice at a flat price. It is advisable to imitate the porridge tickets and designate several restaurants to issue rice upon presentation of the ticket and collect the rice money from the ticket-issuing organization. The advantage of porridge and meal tickets is that everyone issues them according to their own wishes, according to the thickness of their power, and purchases porridge and meal tickets from charitable organizations that issue tickets and distributes them to the poor. This is the so-called using the power of the people to relieve the people, which is more universal and thorough than relying solely on the power of charitable organizations. In view of the severity of this year's living pressure and the large number of poor people suffering from hunger and cold, we sincerely hope that benevolent people will prepare for relief early, without waiting for the height of winter, when hunger and cold lead to successive deaths on the road, before speaking of relief.

### Nanning: Reasons for Japanese Troop Withdrawal: Attempt to Conserve Troops, Unable to Sustain Economic Strain, Bai Chongxi's Report During Memorial Week

Chongqing: Bai Chongxi gave a report at the Central Memorial Week this Monday: (Why the Japanese withdrew from Nanning). He said, "Everyone has paid close attention to the Japanese withdrawal from Nanning over the past week. Based on my personal observation, I will give a simple report. Of course, there are reasons for the Japanese withdrawal from Nanning. According to Japanese newspaper propaganda, Nanning has lost its military importance and there is no need to occupy it for a long time. Although this is a lie, based on our objective observation, the Japanese withdrawal from Nanning shows their weakness, because they do not have enough troops and are trying to conserve troops and redeploy troops. The maximum number of troops that the Japanese can mobilize is seventy-five to eighty divisions. Since the start of the war, the most troops the Japanese have used in China reached forty-two divisions. If we include the nine Japanese divisions in the Northeast, then the Japanese have mobilized fifty-two divisions, accounting for two-thirds of the total number of troops they can mobilize. Under this large mobilization number, the number of Japanese troop losses is even more alarming. According to the Japanese Army Ministry's own announcement, over the past three years, they have lost over one million officers and soldiers, a quarter of whom are dead and three-quarters of whom are wounded. If we examine the Japanese mobilization figures and their casualties, we can see that their total military spending has reached 270 billion yen, a figure that exceeds the military expenditure of the Russo-Japanese War by tenfold. From this, we can know the seriousness of the Japanese economic crisis. (8th)

### Vigorous Morale of Greek Troops; Italian Main Attack Repulsed; Slight Retreat of Greek Troops on Coastal Front; Intense Fighting in Epirus

Athens, According to the Greek military communique released yesterday, local attacks by Italian forces on the Epirus front were all repelled. There was artillery activity on both sides along the entire front. Reports of a slight retreat by the Greek troops yesterday were purely local in nature; the overall situation remains satisfactory. Greek troops continue to capture military supplies in the central area where Italian troops are surrounded. The Greek troops' high morale for offensive and counter-offensive operations remains the same as at the beginning of the war. A Greek bomber was shot down by anti-aircraft fire at the front. On the evening of November 5th, Greek infantry and engineers carried out a courageous action, completely destroying nine enemy tanks that had been damaged by heavy artillery and direct fire two days earlier on the Epirus front. Yesterday's Italian air raids were limited to several small villages near the Albanian border, killing many sheep. Greek reservists of the 1929 class have been ordered to report, including over a hundred officers who were dismissed in 1935 for participating in a coup; they have now been reinstated. Patients with lung diseases at a certain Greek sanatorium wrote to the Greek Commander-in-Chief, Metaxas, volunteering to organize a suicide squad to make any sacrifice, because they feel they are not far from death anyway. (Reuters, 8th)

Athens, According to reliable sources in military circles with access to timely information, early this morning, Greece rushed its elite guard forces to the southern Epirus war front, as Italian invading forces on the Greek-Albanian front are attacking the Metaxas Line with all their mechanized units. The first large-scale all-out offensive by Fascist troops met with fierce resistance from Greek defense forces. A strategically important road in Albania is currently under large-scale Greek bombing. Tirana, the capital of Albania and the Italian military headquarters, is also under heavy bombardment. At the same time, major battles are now unfolding on two main fronts. One is in the western Epirus region, where Italian forces are sending large troops to attack Ioannina. The other is in the central Epirus region, where Greek forces within Albania are intensifying their attack on the Italian base in Korçë. (International Telegram, 8th)

London, According to informed circles here, Greek troops have made slight progress in the Slinnitsa area. As far as is known, Korçë is still in our hands.

Rome, The Italian military headquarters announced that fierce fighting is taking place on the Epirus front. Italian aircraft bombed roads near Lake Prespa and the Kofu Fortress, hitting several bombs. All Italian aircraft returned safely. Six British aircraft attacked Vlorë, four were shot down, and the remaining two are likely to have crashed as well. Several British pilots parachuted, and two were captured. In North Africa, Italian aircraft launched a fierce attack on the Sidi Barrani airfield, strafing at low altitude, causing heavy losses to the British forces. Two aircraft in the field were set on fire by bombs. British aircraft dropped three bombs on the Brindisi station between 3:00 AM and 4:30 AM this morning, and two incendiary bombs near the station. The railway, water pipes, and a freight car were destroyed by the bombs. A nearby civilian house was also set on fire by the bombing but was quickly extinguished, with no casualties. (Naval Telegram, 8th)

Rome, According to a military correspondent for "Il Popolo d'Italia," Greek fortresses are similar to the "Maginot Line" and are built with materials from Britain and France, but Italian tanks, artillery, and machine guns can immediately break through stubborn resistance. Greek troops lack food and weapons.

Sofia, According to Athens radio broadcasts received here, Greek Prime Minister Metaxas declared yesterday that Greece will continue to fight until final victory. Metaxas said, "The methods used by Italy only serve to encourage our people to fight bravely until final victory." (United Press, 8th)

Fierce Battles for Important Highways

Ohrid, The battles between Italian and Greek forces for two important highways became even more intense yesterday. Italian forces attacked the road to Kalpaki and the road from Albania to Ioannina yesterday but were repelled by Greek forces. It is reported that the Greek offensive on the Korçë to Bilisht highway has now weakened. The battle of Ioannina is taking place in the village of Vissani, 23 kilometers from the town. Fifty Italian soldiers, two officers, and two trucks were captured. Three Greek aircraft bombed the Italian base in Argyrokastro yesterday morning. The battle for the Korçë highway is concentrated on the northeast flank of Mount Morova, which overlooks a mountain pass through which the highway passes. On the other side of the pass is Mount Suha. The Greek Third Army is fighting to the death to break through the pass and advance towards the Italian forces on the highway from Kamenica to Korçë, which are now under concentrated artillery fire from the Greek forces. At the same time, the Greek artillery is also bombarding the heavily fortified positions around Mount Morova and Mount Suha. The sound of artillery fire can be heard clearly here. It is also reported that seven Italian troop transports, fully loaded with new troops, arrived at the port of Sarandë in Albania on Wednesday night. These new troops are believed to be going to reinforce the Korçë area. (United Press International, 8th)

Bitola, Yugoslavia, The heaviest artillery fire since the beginning of the war was heard from the Korçë area yesterday afternoon, rumbling here.

According to reports from the west bank of Lake Prespa (Albanian border), the artillery battle began at 2:00 PM and lasted for several hours, with the Greek forces gaining the upper hand. There is also fighting on the south bank of Lake Prespa. The Greek village of German, five kilometers east of the lake, has been completely destroyed by Italian aircraft. The fighting along the lake indicates that Italian forces are attempting to cross the lake and directly attack Greek territory on the other side. At the same time, Italian aircraft launched a large-scale bombing of Florina yesterday morning, and the people of the town have fled. (United Press International, 8th)

Italian Artillery Column Ambushed in Greek Mountains

Athens, Last night, the Greek High Command stated that Greek soldiers set up an ambush and completely annihilated an Italian artillery column that was passing through the Pindus Mountains to reinforce Ioannina, capturing over fifty mountain guns. After this recent great achievement by the brave Greek defense forces, the Greek forces that penetrated deep into Albania also occupied the hills overlooking the Korçë area. As a result, Korçë and 26 neighboring villages are all under Greek control. Italian forces plan to break through the highway to Ioannina, the Greek transportation hub, and strike at the Greek forces along the Ionian coast. However, reports indicate that the Greek forces on the Epirus front are placing them in a difficult situation. The Italian offensive seems to be gradually expanding, becoming the first major offensive since the start of the war. It is also reported that the vanguard of the Greek troops in skirts has advanced twelve miles north of Korçë and has begun to attack the rear of the defense forces in the area. There is also increased air activity around the city. (International Telegram, 8th)

British Aircraft Bomb Italian Air Force Base

Cairo, According to the British official report released here today, the bomber squadron under the British forces in the Near East attacked the real center point of the Italian invasion of Greece early yesterday morning, causing a major fire and turning the important Italian naval base of Brindisi into ruins. In addition, the mechanized unit of the Indian Army, supplemented by the British Air Force stationed in Sudan, has captured Gallabat, an important town on the Abyssinian border. This is the second major blow suffered by the Italian forces yesterday. Braving the raging anti-aircraft fire, British aircraft began to bomb Brindisi from late Wednesday night until yesterday morning. Hundreds of tons of high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs were dropped by British aircraft like rain, falling on naval shipyards, submarine bases, railway stations, and Italian military barracks. The sky over the entire area of this large port in the Adriatic Sea, between the various shipyards and railway yards, was filled with British bombers, and the number of fires was countless. It is believed that thousands of Italian soldiers concentrated in Brindisi, waiting for trains to the Albanian border, were all buried in this battle. (International News Agency, 8th)

London, A Reuters air force correspondent stated that British fighter planes have now begun to assist the Greek Air Force in protecting Greek cities and towns from Italian air raids. British aircraft patrolled Greek airspace on Wednesday and did not encounter Italian aircraft. On Tuesday, British aircraft assisted the Greek defense forces in repelling an Italian attack on Piraeus and shot down an Italian aircraft. The Italian city of Brindisi was raided by British aircraft on Tuesday night. The city is a major seaport for the Italian forces in Albania to receive supplies and reinforcements, and its importance is comparable to that of Bari. At the same time, the Central Air Force also conducted extensive reconnaissance in various Italian ports and along the coast. (Reuters, 8th)

Rome, An Italian military communiqué acknowledged that British aircraft had raided Brindisi and destroyed the military station there. (Reuters, 8th)

London, According to an official communiqué released here, a squadron of British bombers in Greece raided the Italian airfield in Vlorë on Wednesday, with great success. British aircraft dropped bombs on Italian aircraft parked on the ground and strafed with machine guns. A large number of Italian air force personnel stationed at the field were also attacked. Italian fighter planes took off to intercept, but without effect. All British aircraft returned to base safely. The leader of the British aircraft, upon returning, told people that our attack was completely unexpected by the enemy, so we were able to drop bombs smoothly and without hindrance. Our observers saw the bombs we dropped explode among the enemy aircraft parked on the ground, inflicting heavy damage. (Reuters, 8th)

Italian Aircraft Intensify Activities to Hinder Greek Offensive

Rome, According to a report released here, the superiority of the Italian Air Force is the most important factor in the war on the Greek front. Greek attempts to launch offensives in the Florina area, the Lake Prespa area, and the Capeshti Pass were all hindered by the swift action of the Italian Air Force. After the Italian military learned that the Greek military intended to attack in the Lake Prespa area, they immediately sent aircraft to attack Greek military positions and troop concentrations in the area, preventing the Greek offensive from materializing. Greek air defense equipment is incomplete, lacking anti-aircraft guns, so the machine guns used are very ineffective. In the Florina area, Italian aircraft attacked stations, railways, and highways, cutting off transportation. It is said that on the Kalamas front, due to recent heavy rains, the river has flooded, and the roads are muddy. Italian engineers are very busy preparing the roadbed so that artillery and ammunition can advance. (Haitong Telegram, 8th)

Greek Officials Deny Entry of British Troops Before the War

The British fleet only arrived in Crete several days after the start of the war. (Reuters, 8th)

### Southern Ireland Firmly Refuses; Britain to Lease Ports; De Valera Reaffirms Neutrality Policy; Northern Ireland's Prime Minister Laments for Britain

Dublin, The proposal to lease Irish Free State seaports to Britain for use was flatly rejected yesterday by Irish Prime Minister de Valera. De Valera also warned Britain that if Britain attempts to obtain it through pressure, it will "only lead to bloodshed." This Irish leader, born in New York, stated in a fiery speech in Parliament that Ireland is determined and prepared to protect its neutrality or independence, resorting to force if necessary. De Valera's speech was clearly a response to British Prime Minister Churchill's speech on Tuesday. De Valera also warned the people, "The crisis is coming." (Note: Churchill admitted during his speech that the German submarine warfare was indeed a more serious problem than the German air raids. Churchill also believed that the high number of British merchant ships lost to German submarines was due to the Anglo-Irish Treaty before the war. Government officials explained that this meant that the victory of the German submarine warfare was largely due to the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which prevented Britain from using key Irish ports as naval bases. During the last World War, Britain used Queenstown as a naval base, and since then, the place has been renamed Cobh.) De Valera denied in his speech yesterday that German submarines had ever used Ireland as a place to refuel. De Valera stated, "Any belligerent country, including Britain, that attempts to exert pressure on us will only cause bloodshed. The government will defend our rights as long as it is in office. While Ireland maintains its neutrality, our key ports cannot be leased or transferred." (International Telegram, 8th)

London, Northern Ireland's Prime Minister Craigavon expressed regret last night regarding Southern Ireland's Prime Minister de Valera's declaration that he would not grant Britain the convenience of Southern Irish ports. It is said that we deeply regret the attitude of the Southern Irish government, but those who have studied every stage of the Southern Irish policy are not surprised by this. Because Southern Ireland has always received concessions from Britain, but has never intended to repay them. At a time when the British Empire is fighting for its survival, the Southern Irish government is declaring neutrality towards the country that it relies on for its preservation, making it more difficult. In summary, de Valera's announcement is the culmination of a development that Northern Ireland has long anticipated. (Reuters, 8th)

### Soviet Union Celebrates Revolution Anniversary, Grand Parade in Red Square, National Defense Commissar Encourages National Unity, Red Army Fully Prepared to Repel the Enemy

Moscow: Yesterday marked the 23rd anniversary of the Soviet Union's October Revolution, celebrated enthusiastically by the entire nation. Streets were packed with people, and workers, employees, cultural figures, and students held solemn gatherings in their factories and schools. At ten o'clock, crowds streamed into Red Square to watch the military parade. Red Square was filled with people, including members of the Supreme Soviet, members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, Soviet heroes, Red Army soldiers, scientists, representatives from Lithuania and Estonia, and members of the diplomatic corps. Foreign journalists and the diplomatic corps occupied special seating. The troops participating in the parade were in impressive array. At eleven o'clock, Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, and Kalinin entered the square one after another, greeted by enthusiastic cheers from the crowd. Simultaneously, People's Commissar of Defense Marshal Timoshenko rode into the square, and the entire square erupted in thunderous applause. After listening to the report from General Turunaev, the parade commander, Marshal Timoshenko began the inspection. He then ascended the platform to deliver a speech, congratulating the workers, peasants, Soviets, Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians on the October Revolution on behalf of the Party and the government. When Marshal Timoshenko finished his speech and toasted Stalin's longevity, the entire square cheered for several minutes. At this time, the band played the Internationale, and artillery fired a salute.

The troops then began to advance, first the students of the Frunze Military Academy, followed by the students of the Lenin Military Political Academy and personnel from the Stalin Motor and Mechanical Academy. Their impressive appearance demonstrated their effective training. In addition, the Civil Aviation Corps, led by the Dean of the Civil Aviation Academy, also participated in the parade, including several female pilots. When the Baltic Fleet personnel passed the reviewing stand, the entire square stood up and cheered. Noteworthy was the new war weapon, manufactured by students from specialized schools, who will become excellent artillerymen in the Red Army. A team of armed Moscow laborers also participated in the parade, including veteran soldiers of advanced age and new soldiers about to join the Red Army. Furthermore, cavalry galloped across the square in an orderly fashion. The armored vehicles, tanks, and new artillery participating in the parade made a profound impression.

The parade lasted for an hour and a half, showcasing the great and impressive strength of the Red Army. During the military parade, various Soviet aircraft also flew over Red Square. Soviet pilots performed various amazing feats with their latest high-speed aircraft, leaving people speechless. There had been demonstrations in Moscow before, but none had been on such a large scale or with such broad sentiment. As the crowds entered Red Square, they cheered towards Stalin and Molotov. They marched shoulder to shoulder with other demonstrators, including countless enthusiastic young men, all of whom practiced parachute jumping and driving skills in addition to their daily work. This demonstration showed the Soviet people's determination to strengthen discipline and national defense. There were thousands of slogans in Red Square, all unanimously supporting Stalin and the Soviet government's wise diplomatic policy, which aims to consolidate peace and ensure the security of the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the representatives of the new republics were extremely popular yesterday, demonstrating the strong spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people and their loyalty to the great leader Stalin, the Soviet government, and the Communist Party.

Full Text of the National Defense Commissar's Speech

Moscow: During the military parade, National Defense Commissar Marshal Timoshenko delivered a speech, stating, "Comrades of the Red Army, representatives of workers and peasants, and Soviet Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian comrades, on behalf of the Soviet Communist Party Executive Committee and the Soviet government, I congratulate you on the 23rd anniversary of the October Revolution. Years of construction work by the Soviet people have passed, which will be a victory of the socialist era in the history of the October Revolution. This victory was achieved under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and the wise guidance of the great Stalin. With strong confidence, the Soviet people have implemented the great Third Five-Year Plan. We have achieved great achievements in the economy. Our socialist industry and agriculture are developing. The production of military equipment, machinery, oil, other daily necessities, and agricultural products has also increased. Labor discipline has been strengthened. Genuine Bolshevik orders have been implemented in factories and collective farms. The Stakhanovite movement is also expanding. In short, our country has multiplied its defense and economic strength. We celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the October Revolution at a time of extremely complex international circumstances. The war is expanding, and half of the world's population is currently affected. The war is extremely brutal, and millions of lives have been lost. Cultural and material losses are immeasurable. The wise Stalinist diplomatic policy (a policy of peace and security to guarantee national security) has achieved significant victories. The Soviet Union has not participated in the war. The Soviet government is committed to safeguarding the people's peaceful work. The Soviet Union's international position has also improved. Based on the strength of the Red Army, the Soviet Union has adopted peaceful methods to resolve the Soviet-Romanian disputes regarding Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. At the same time, the hated landlord and capitalist regime of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia has been destroyed. The people have regained their freedom and have been forever freed from hunger and poverty. They now enjoy a happy life. Under the radiant light of Stalin, the industry and agriculture of these states will continue to develop forever. To safeguard border security and national interests, the Soviet Union's borders have expanded to the Gulf of Finland, the Baltic Sea, and the Danube River. Capitalist countries have been forced to concede. All of these achievements have strengthened our country's national defense. However, we cannot be complacent about various achievements. We must be extra vigilant. Comrade Stalin once said, "We must always keep the entire nation mobilized and ready to respond to foreign attacks, so that the enemy's "accidents" and various tricks cannot be implemented." We must keep this instruction in mind. We must also strengthen the Red Army and the Navy in all aspects, further enhance our country's national defense and economic strength. The working masses of our country must also work harder, strengthen their discipline, and increase productivity. Their work will make the country even stronger. On the other hand, the Red Army is indeed the only guarantee of the working masses' peaceful work and the great achievements of the October Revolution, and is ready to fulfill its sacred mission at any time. Under the orders of the government and the Communist Party, the Red Army will defeat any enemy who dares to invade the sacred borders of the socialist state." (TASS dispatch, 8th)

### US Treasury Department Plans to Recommend Increasing Public Debt to Cover Defense Expenditures

Washington: US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told reporters that the Treasury Department will ask Congress to increase the statutory public debt limit by $150 billion to cover defense program expenses. If so, the Treasury Department will be able to support the 1942 fiscal year. When reporters asked if this increase would be sufficient for the next four years, the Treasury Secretary replied that it would not, because the United States is only just beginning to rearm. The Treasury Department will recommend to Congress that future government bond issuances also be taxed. He hopes that Congress can make central and local government bonds uniformly taxable, but this only refers to future issuances. The increase in public debt may coincide with an increase in taxes, but he does not believe that there is a possibility of establishing a tax base everywhere. Now that the defense program has been fully implemented, the problem of rising prices and possible inflation will arise, but he does not worry about inflation. After Morgenthau made this statement, the market situation was confirmed to be very strong. Wall Street insiders believe that this statement contains inflationary implications.

### Mrs. President Roosevelt

If Americans believe in fortune-telling, then Mrs. President Roosevelt must truly have the "luck of helping her husband." If you don't believe it, look at how she campaigned politically for her husband and how she organized various groups, enabling her husband to be re-elected president for three terms. We often say that a talented wife is a good helper, but this Mrs. Roosevelt can be called a "good helper both inside and outside."

Robert Blake, biographer of Mrs. President Roosevelt, "Eleanor Roosevelt," said: "If Republican candidate Willkie wants to be elected President of the United States, he has to defeat not just one Roosevelt, but two. Although President Roosevelt does not actually participate in the election campaign, that second Roosevelt is also very formidable."

Who is the second Roosevelt? It is undoubtedly Mrs. President Roosevelt. Her maiden name was also Roosevelt, and she married a husband who was also a Roosevelt. As a result, the nieces and nephews of the couple are all Roosevelts, which often confuses people. Willkie could not defeat the male Roosevelt, but he actually suffered quite a few losses at the hands of the female Roosevelt. The Roosevelt couple work together, and now they are securely in their third term as masters of the White House.

Mrs. President Roosevelt openly participating in the presidential election for her husband is very rare in history. In fact, this is just her surface work. Secretly, she had already completed many tasks quietly during normal times. Democratic Party veteran propaganda director Michelson has always disliked women in politics, but he has a different view of Mrs. Roosevelt, praising her as the greatest female politician in the world. Former Chairman Farley of the Democratic National Convention said that Mrs. Roosevelt is one of the top political figures, whether male or female.

Eleanor Roosevelt's "formidable" nature can be analyzed into the following four points:

(1) Her character: Eleanor Roosevelt can be said to be the most prestigious woman in the United States. She hosts the "My Day" column in the newspaper, writing articles every day. Although they have no political meaning, they are extremely influential. Millions of readers take her words and deeds as their model. From 1933 to 1934, those who called her "formidable" have now changed their attitude and have great respect for her.

(2) Her leadership position in the women's community: Not only during the election, she is the leader of the women's community, but also on weekdays, she does various preparatory work, and has always been a leader among women. Before her husband served as Governor of New York, she traveled around giving speeches, making women interested in their policies. As a result of her efforts, the Democratic Women's Department has become a politically powerful organization.

(3) She is a friend to young people: Among all the leaders in the United States, Eleanor Roosevelt spends the most time and energy thoroughly studying youth issues. She often extends rational sympathy to various youth movements, enabling President Roosevelt and the nation's youth to understand each other without any barriers. In this election, many young people of voting age supported Roosevelt, which was largely due to his wife's daily activities.

(4) Her political strategy: In every Democratic Party campaign over the years, there has not been one without her planning the overall strategy.

In addition, whenever there is an election, in addition to giving speeches everywhere herself, she also goes all out to encourage and comfort party members, raise funds, and study local conditions, becoming a pillar of the Democratic Party. As for her speaking ability, she can be said to be one of the best in the United States. After the launch of this election campaign, the Democratic Party representatives lobbied everywhere, and they all felt tired and bored. Because it was like this in the first election, like this in the second election, and now it was going to be like this in the third election. Everyone was almost unable to support it. So they all hoped that President Roosevelt could personally take the stage and give a shot in the arm, but the old man shook his feather fan leisurely and was slow to get started. Once, when Wallace was giving a speech, the audience suddenly became restless, and the audience responded to the speaker with hisses of contempt. Several representatives looked at each other, and no one could come up with an idea. At that time, Mrs. President Roosevelt was also in the audience, and someone suggested that Mrs. Roosevelt be invited to give a speech. Mrs. Roosevelt took the lead and went on stage at this critical moment. Strangely enough, she used just a few simple words to capture the hearts of the audience. In just a few minutes, everyone listened with sincerity, and there was not a sound in the audience. Of course, the reporters present all said that it was rare for the audience to be so moved by the speech.

Mrs. Roosevelt is also a champion in organizing women's groups and guiding women's movements in various places. Democratic women have established pro-Roosevelt President associations of all sizes in various places, and the momentum is so great that Willkie is at a loss.

Eleanor Roosevelt participated in political activities in 1922 for the sake of her husband and family. Until now, she still does not give up her political career for these two reasons. Her basic concept is that the town, the city, the state, and the country are all derived from the family and are just a reduced form of the family. If a woman is not interested in the government, then it is difficult to expect her to fulfill her responsibilities fully in the family. She instilled this idea everywhere in the minds of women. Regardless of wealth or poverty, she always used this theory to move them, calling on American women to come into contact with politics.

While Roosevelt was Governor of New York, his wife often went out with him on inspections. Later, Roosevelt became paralyzed and had difficulty walking. All inspections, prisons, schools, and other matters that required the governor to go were handled by Mrs. Roosevelt. At first, she couldn't get used to it and found it extremely annoying, but later she enjoyed it. Now she often says: "This is the best education I have ever received." After 1933, she became her husband's unofficial inspector, and all the affairs handled by the federal government were within her scope of inspection.

Everything she learns, she always imparts to others. Therefore, American women generally understand and recognize the relationship between the government, the government and the family, with children, and with their husbands' businesses more clearly than women in other countries. All of this must be attributed to Mrs. Roosevelt's instillation.

Regarding this election, she had a famous saying: "This matter concerns national safety. Every voter should clearly recognize "under which person, which party, can the country obtain the greatest safety" before the election. These words are truly said very thoroughly, no wonder everyone wants to follow her."

Mrs. Roosevelt likes to correspond with the general public in person, so that the public and the president have a good feeling. On the one hand, she conveys the desires of the people and the appeals of the lower classes, so that the president in the high halls and remote mansions can also thoroughly understand them, so that there is no danger of estrangement.

After Roosevelt recovered from paralysis, his mother asked him to move from the White House to his hometown of Hyde Park for quiet recuperation. This was a mother's love, and her affection was so sincere and meticulous. Mrs. Roosevelt believed that if Roosevelt could resume political life, his physical recovery would be faster. From then on, there were inevitable differences of opinion between the women. Roosevelt then asked his husband's personal physician, Dr. Treber, about this issue. Treber replied: "Does he still want to live, or die spiritually? If he wants life, then he can live on. All living people will feel tired, and the injury I suffer from fatigue will never exceed the fatigue caused by the injury." As a result, Mrs. Roosevelt won.

Mrs. President Roosevelt is energetic and clear-headed. She doesn't know how many things she does in a day, seeing guests, attending meetings, writing, busy non-stop. She herself said? The only key to dealing with various affairs without exhausting yourself is in "how to train yourself." One day, she was discussing with her comrades how to carry out the women's work program, and President Roosevelt suddenly called, wanting to discuss something with her. The two of them discussed another issue over the phone for a long time. After talking, she put down the telephone and continued to discuss the women's work case. She immediately continued the discussion from the point where the phone call interrupted, with her head in order and without any confusion. Her clarity of mind can be imagined.

For seven years, Mrs. Roosevelt has had extensive contact with all kinds of people in the government and the public, and she has a thorough understanding of the psychology of people from all walks of life. In addition, she obtained a lot of news from other sources. Of course, much of this news was not very "pleasant to hear," and she always told the President everything. She believes that her husband is the President, high above, surrounded by the high halls and mansions of the White House, and the close-by guards and detectives. Although there are many wise men around him, it is difficult to guarantee that there is no one who specializes in guessing the psychology of those in power, always saying "yes, yes, yes..." On the other hand, the President himself also knows that even his political enemies often refuse to talk frankly in person, so he often says: "Anyone will tell anything to Eleanor." The importance of Mrs. Roosevelt is fully revealed in her husband's understatement.

### Central Daily News Comments on the International Situation

Chongqing: Today's editorial in the Central Daily News stated that the current lull in the wars in Europe and the Far East is likely the calm before a major storm. The future development of the Far East depends on where the Japanese troops now withdrawing from China are sent. The future development of Europe depends on what steps Turkey takes in the Balkans. Now that President Roosevelt has been re-elected, and Germany and Italy's attempts to obtain aid from France have failed, it remains to be seen what actions Germany and Italy will take. Japan's usual trick is to hide behind others. When Germany and Italy take action again, its mask will surely be revealed. (Reuters, 8th)

### Physical Education Director of the YMCA, Mr. Bretall, Promotes New Type of Basketball Game. Bretall Talks About the Method and Characteristics of the Game. Universally Popular and Exceptionally Interesting.

Mr. Bretall, Physical Education Director of the local YMCA, returned to Shanghai before last month after his vacation in his home country. While in the United States, Bretall witnessed a new type of basketball game that is very popular there, called "GOAL-HI." After arriving in Shanghai, Bretall plans to promote this new sport and spread it throughout Shanghai. According to Mr. Bretall yesterday, this interesting, safe, and beneficial sport is most suitable for women or junior high school children, but it is also suitable for adults. The playing field is circular, with a common basket in the middle. Ordinary basketball games often have the ball going out of bounds after a shot, but this can be avoided in this game, and the game does not have to be interrupted. The field is divided into two circles. The smaller one is six feet from the basket, called the restricted circle, and the larger one is fifteen feet from this circle, called the free throw circle. Shots made outside the restricted circle but inside the free throw circle score one point. Shots made outside the free throw circle score two points, but shots inside the restricted circle are not allowed. The other rules are similar to those of ordinary basketball games. The game also has two special features: (1) The height of the basket can be raised or lowered at will, to eight feet for junior high school students, nine feet for senior high school students, and ten feet for university students. (2) There is no limit to the number of players. In schools, the entire class can participate in the game at the same time. Therefore, the nature of the game is very universal, and the fun is extraordinarily strong.

### Rising Tide of Domestic Debt

The over-the-counter securities market fluctuated quite a bit yesterday. It was heard that the First Special District had been occupied, and sentiment weakened for a time, but prices were raised again by the bulls, and Class A, D, and E all saw new highs again. Class A was relatively cheap, so the rise was stronger. Class C's market price was too high, so it only rose slightly. The bullish sentiment on the trading floor remained very strong, and it was not easy to fall back for the time being. Some bulls came out, while others were still buying. The general excitement had not diminished. Yesterday morning, Lianhe, Yitai, Jiufeng, Dahua, and Datong bought Class A, D, and E, and new highs were seen again. Some bulls at Tongkang came out, and Renchang also sold. The prices rose another 4 to 7 jiao before noon. In the afternoon, it was heard that the courthouse had been occupied, and the market opened sharply lower by 3 to 8 jiao. Later, the bulls raised prices again, and the market recovered slightly. Lianyi, Jiufeng, Gongmao, and Hongda all bought, while Xinhua and Xinfu sold heavily. Runli Shengda and Wanchun sold quite a bit. Class C broke through the 3 yuan mark, and after that, scattered retail investors covered their short positions, and the price was raised back to 3 yuan. As a result of the close, except for Class C, which fell 1 jiao, the others continued to rise by 1, 2, or up to 7 jiao. The transaction volume was about 2.4 to 2.5 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.

In stock trading, 100 shares of Great China Match were traded at a price of 94 yuan and 25 cents.

Yesterday, the stock market was affected by the sharp rise in US stocks, and almost all stocks saw new highs not seen in a long time. Brokers estimated that the amount of excessive floating profits this week must be not be small, and they were surprised that very few people made a final settlement yesterday. From this, it can be seen that the strength of new buyers is very strong. Among industrial stocks, the stocks that are often loved by the public led the way. Rubber stocks, after the announcement of dividends, have almost completely recovered their past confidence. Many stocks, including those of East India companies, were in demand.

London, 7th (Thursday): Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remained flat. Only bank stocks fluctuated slightly. Mercantile Bank shares rose 3 shillings and 9 pence, to 7 pounds, 1 shilling, and 3 pence. Chartered Bank shares fell 6 shillings and 3 pence, to 10 pounds, 1 shilling, and 3 pence.

### British Gold Needs to Shift to Guangdong

In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The British-American exchange rate in the unofficial market showed an uncertain trend.

### Evening Selling Pressure Emerged Suddenly, Gold Market Wanted to Rise But Stopped

Yesterday, the unofficial market for gold bars initially opened high, but as the foreign exchange market showed a soft trend, banks actively bought in, maintaining the price. Furthermore, the market opened firmly in the afternoon. Unexpectedly, selling pressure emerged in the evening, driving the price down. It was heard that securities firms and bullish gold and silver shops were selling. The closing price was only 5527 yuan, down 13 yuan from the previous day. There were 2500 taels traded throughout the day. The price of gold ornaments remained unchanged. Customs gold, etc., were stable.

Gold Bars Dropped 13 Yuan

Soon, the banks bought in and the price rebounded. Gold shops bought in 30 taels at 5545 yuan. Subsequently, the money changers' intention to sell suddenly emerged, and the upward trend was slightly frustrated. Securities firms sold 20 taels to gold shops, falling to 5528 yuan. Later, the banks continued to absorb some, and the exchange rate turned tight, coupled with optimistic news, and sentiment was firmer. Securities firms entered 20 taels into gold shops, rising to 5562 yuan. By the time of the noon closing, banks were trading 10 taels at 5960 yuan, and the market was very stable. The market continued to rise in the early afternoon. Banks entered gold shops with 10 taels at 5575 yuan. Before long, securities firms entered silver shops with 20 taels, rising another 10 yuan to a high price of 5580 yuan.

### More Foreign Rice Expected to Arrive This Morning; Foreign Rice Was Still Being Manipulated Yesterday

The China-Lun Foreign Firm's Haida vessel, carrying 17,000 bags of rice from Siam, was mentioned in yesterday's newspaper. According to the company, it is now scheduled to arrive at the port at 8:00 AM this morning and dock at the Bund pier on Beijing Road to unload. (Zhu)

Yesterday, the foreign rice market was dominated by monopoly, external manipulation, and blind following by speculators, leading to a chaotic market. Furthermore, foreign merchants stated that in addition to the difficulty in securing cargo ship berths, they recently had to increase water freight and military insurance fees, totaling more than 4 yuan per bag. Therefore, the price was immediately raised by 3 yuan. This was because ships transporting rice from Saigon were mostly controlled by French merchants, allowing them to do as they pleased. The recycled original bags in the market also took the opportunity to increase by 2-3 yuan. There were 1400-1500 tons of new transactions, and nearly 1000 tons of recycled rice. No. 1 Saigon rice, previously priced at 72 yuan for December delivery, reached 75 yuan yesterday. No. 2 rice, previously priced at 70 yuan, reached 73 yuan yesterday. No. 1 for immediate loading was also priced at 76.7-77 yuan. With the price increase, the spot price rose by half a yuan in the morning. Later, the street sales also competed to buy, making the situation even tighter, rising all the way up. The highest price was reached at midday, with No. 2 Pagoda Brand bank stock at 64.5 yuan, an increase of 1.5-2 yuan. Subsequently, most of the bulls saw that prices were high and buying interest waned. At the same time, a large number of original roots were thrown out, no less than 5000-6000 bags, and those who had been caged at high prices also came out in large numbers, gradually falling. By the close, the market price had decreased by nearly a yuan, so the resulting closing price actually increased by a yuan. However, in the afternoon, someone started to manipulate again, raising it by about 1 yuan.

New short-grain rice and wild rice of tea varieties are still in short supply, with only 1300-1400 piculs. Sellers were firm, and buyers were eager to buy, leading to a buoyant market with prices rising by a huge 1-2 yuan. Tuan New Short-Grain original bag was priced at 87.5 yuan, and closed at 84 yuan. The price per picul was seen at 82 yuan and closed at 79 yuan. Lu Rice was priced at 80 yuan and 79 yuan. Wild Rice Special was priced at 85 yuan and 84 yuan. Du Short-Grain original bag was priced at 76 yuan, and the price per picul was seen at 72-70 yuan. However, Lamb Short-Grain was flat due to the influence of foreign rice, with an original bag priced at 70 yuan and the price per picul seen at 67 yuan.

Glutinous rice is currently tight, and in addition to the real sales to wineries and food stalls, there were also large buyers absorbing, so the market was also rising by a yuan. National Glutinous rice opened at 76 yuan, and foreign glutinous rice at 74.5-72 yuan.

### Large Batch of Foreign Flour Rumored to Arrive in Shanghai

Trading in flour is still quiet, and the market remains flat. The price of No. 1 Flour Mill remains unchanged. In addition to supplying daily needs in the street, the sales to customers in Penang have not started, and the recycled goods of various brands are only quoted but not actually sold. The foreign flour market has secretly eased, as rumors spread that a large batch of foreign flour will arrive in Shanghai around the 15th, with only a few days left, and people's hearts are inevitably withering. It is heard that high-grade foreign flour is only selling for 18 yuan 8 jiao, and there are still no buyers for the whole amount. The two mills in the city sold a total of more than 8,000 bags, and 2,000-3,000 bags of foreign flour. The market is as quiet as usual.

The wheat market is still quiet. Japanese mills are buying at the original price, with 100-200 bags of wheat from the suburbs, while the market price must be 27 yuan, because it is very difficult to transport it into the concession, and various expenses are very high, so the difference is as high as 5-6 yuan. It is heard that the Chinese mills are not producing much at present, and there is no way to smoothly purchase raw materials, so they are also waiting and watching, causing the market to become sluggish again.

Yarn and Cotton

### Sales to Hong Kong Continue Uninterrupted; Cotton Yarn Prices Rise Sharply

The yarn market is firm, and the monthly price increase trend is gradually advancing. This is because, although there are no wholesale transactions in Hong Kong, the retail purchases continue uninterrupted. Therefore, there is a keen demand for 32-count and 42-count yarns, as well as 10-count coarse yarns, and the selling price is very high. According to this ratio, the price of 20-count yarn is relatively cheap, so a portion of people's minds are changing to be optimistic. It is also said that the inventory of 20-count yarn from the Double Horse factory with single chips in the market has decreased by about 5000-6000 bags, but if the sales of 20-count yarn do not expand at present, and until the actual sales rise, the market cannot rise.

The yarn market opened in the morning with a good tone due to the high sentiment in the afternoon of the previous day. The first price of 20-count Double Horse was 1220 yuan, rising slightly to 1228 yuan. At this time, it was argued that the US loan had another 800,000 established. This bearish news slightly increased the pressure of selling, falling to 1217 yuan. However, once the price eased, there was a lack of selling, and the sellers thought about making up for it, thereby tightening the inventory and rapidly rising the market price to 1234 yuan. Subsequently, profit-taking weakened slightly, and the closing price was 1231 yuan. According to statistics, 4415 bags were traded in half a day, and the price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 11 yuan. The amounts purchased by various guilds are listed as follows:

The afternoon yarn market continued to advance with a good rising tone. The market price of 20-count Double Horse in the yarn market exchange opened at 1237 yuan, with 40 bags traded. People's sentiments are solid. 590 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today.

### No Hope for Local Cotton Source

Although trading in spot cotton is rare, the general sentiment is optimistic. This is because the inventory of cotton is dwindling, and there is no hope for sources from various routes. What comes are all scattered amounts, but currently the manufacturers are eager to buy, and once the demand comes, the market price is likely to be seen higher.

Piece Goods

### Customer Groups Rush to Buy Hot-Selling Goods

The fabric market yesterday showed a strong trend with good sentiment. The local industry and hoarders were actively buying and selling. Customer groups selected hot-selling goods and searched for them. The selling price of fine cloth and fine twill were stable. The price of Ewo coarse cloth also leveled, while the price of the local mill's light and heavy weights fell by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao. The prices of bleached and dyed cloth varied slightly. Orders for spring yarn thread and net cloth have been placed one after another. The Hongzhang Mill's futures striped lining cloth was quoted at 1 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen per yard. The ready-made goods of Guangzhong and other mills were traded in the market. More than 600 pieces of various goods were traded in the local street. The Zhejiang, Wenzhou, and Ningbo customer groups bought more than 200 pieces of fine cloth, blue cloth, and flannel. The Fujian and Guangdong customer groups bought 200+ pieces of coarse cloth, twill, and colored cloth. 530 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong today.

### Camel's Wool Flannel Overcoats - Following Cavalry Twill -

The sales of woolen fabrics were very strong yesterday, but the Nanjing group is gradually experiencing shortages due to the difficulty of transporting woolen fabrics. It is heard that the Ewo Cavalry Twill, which sells for 23-24 yuan per yard in Shanghai, can be sold for 33-34 yuan in the Nanjing market. In light of this, many brokers carry 5-6 sets or 30-40 yards with them, traveling back and forth to sell every week or ten days.

Camel's wool flannel has recently become very popular, and the market is exceptionally firm. The current price for spot delivery of imported goods is 44 yuan per yard, and 45.5 yuan for those with Western characters woven on the edge. Local mill goods of Shanghai weaving sell for 24-25 yuan for ordinary goods and around 30 yuan for first-class goods. The market for Cavalry Twill is relatively flat and the trend is not as popular as Camel's wool flannel. Currently, Chinese and Western style overcoats are the same, and Camel's wool flannel is more popular than Cavalry Twill.

North-South Goods

### Black Melon Seeds Turn Down

Black melon seeds have recently seen sluggish sales and a decline in the downstream market, falling by varying amounts of 5-6 yuan. For example, large sliced Ji Kui seeds are now selling for 105 yuan, Xu Kui seeds for 96 yuan, and Chinese style seeds for around 90 yuan to 86-87 yuan. Dalian seeds are at 78 yuan.

Sugar Market

### Foreign Sugar Stockpiling Resurges

The sugar market trend continued to rise yesterday with new stockpiles being absorbed. The spot price of 24 coarse white sugar from the local warehouse was 71 yuan 5 jiao, while the price from outside warehouses was 71-71.3 yuan, up 3 jiao. The Swire Car White B Mark from the western warehouse was 72.3-72.5 yuan, and from the eastern warehouse was 71.5-71.7 yuan, up 7 jiao. The DY Mark from the eastern warehouse was 67.1-67.2 yuan, also up 7 jiao. The HX Mark from the western warehouse was 67 yuan, and from the eastern warehouse was 66.8 yuan, up 4 jiao. The MH Mark from the eastern warehouse was 63 yuan. The H Mark red sand from the eastern warehouse was 53 yuan. The Dutch cotton white high grade RA Mark was 71 yuan, and the delivery goods BS Mark was 68 yuan. The spot price of Dutch red sugar was 55-55.4 yuan, and the one for November 18th listing was 55.3-55.5 yuan, up 4-5 jiao. A total of more than 5000 bags were traded.

Coal

### Coal Balls Add Factory Price Again - 7 Yuan 6 Jiao per Load -

Due to the soaring price of raw materials recently, the new water freight of Yitai Hing coal balls reaches 33 shillings per ton (more than one legal currency silver dollar), and the cost is closely related. Therefore, the factory price has temporarily increased by 8 yuan from yesterday. The price for the same industry to pick up each ton is 140 yuan and the price delivered to the door is 152 yuan, 7 yuan and 6 jiao per load. As for raw materials, it is intended to find a way to recover the original state in order to make the ignition resistance the main one. It is heard that other small factories will also increase the price in the coming days.

Hardware

### Flat White Iron Rises Sharply, Tin Continues to Rise

The market for flat white iron has recently seen intermittent interest from local river traders, street stockpilers, and small-scale construction users, leading to unusually sharp price increases. Currently, 7-foot sizes are priced at 8.989 yuan, and 6-foot sizes at 7.78 yuan. Market inventories are limited, and overseas shipments have ceased, indicating a strong upward trend.

The tin market is affected by imports from Hong Kong, causing a noticeable shortage of spot goods in the local market. This has led to bullish sentiment among dealers, with standard prices trending upward. Yesterday, 99.99% pure tin was quoted at 1,500 yuan, with most demand coming from small-scale buyers in this district. Transactions from dealers and wholesalers are relatively rare.

### French Concession Court Seized, Foreign Ministry Lodges Serious Protest, French Side Should Bear Full Responsibility for Violating the Agreement, Protectors of Law Have All Withdrawn

The status of the French Concession Court has changed since yesterday. The Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court and the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court were forcibly taken over yesterday under the guard of the French police and the support of the Japanese military police. The French Consul General, M. Mager, has instructed Havas News Agency to issue a statement publicly announcing a compromise with the Japanese side, transferring the "jurisdiction" of the two courts. Thus, the fourteen articles of the Sino-French agreement on the French Concession Court, signed on July 28, 1931, have been unilaterally violated.

Foreign Ministry Statement, Solemn Position

Chongqing, 8th Dispatch: Regarding the seizure of the Chinese court in the Shanghai French Concession, the Foreign Ministry spokesman issued the following statement today: "The Ministry has just received a notification from the French side stating that the Shanghai French Concession authorities concluded an agreement on the 7th of this month, allowing a certain party to take over the Chinese court within the concession, and this has been implemented this morning." After investigation, we have repeatedly stated to the French side regarding this matter that if the Chinese court in the French Concession is seized, not only will the physical and property of Chinese residents be constrained, but also the rights and interests of foreigners will be endangered. We have repeatedly demanded that the French side strictly refuse and pay attention to the serious responsibility it bears for this matter. However, the French side has yielded and, at the cost of violating the Sino-French agreement on the establishment of the Chinese court in the Shanghai French Concession on July 28, 1931, illegally transferred it. The Ministry has lodged a serious protest with the French side. Under the above circumstances, our government has no choice but to order the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court and the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court to temporarily cease exercising their functions within the French Concession. Hereafter, any organization claiming to be a Chinese court within the French Concession is naturally illegal, and all its judgments and any other actions are invalid. The French side shall bear all responsibility."

First Invasion of the Higher Court Third Branch

At 10:20 AM yesterday, two cars of the French Concession Defense Forces with registration numbers 251 and 382, and three other black-plated cars suddenly drove to the entrance of Lane 23, West End Avenue, where the Higher Court Third Branch was located. The drivers were all wearing Japanese military police uniforms. Immediately, twelve Japanese plainclothes personnel and twenty other Chinese, including Qiao Wanxuan, the former Chief Prosecutor of the Higher Court Third Branch, and Sun Shaokang, the Chief Prosecutor of the Second Special Court, rushed into the Higher Court Third Branch. She Gen, the Chief Advisor of the Legal Advisory Office of the French Concession Council, had arrived at the court beforehand to wait.

President Begs for Help without Success

When these individuals arrived at the court, Zhan Jifeng also entered with them. It is rumored that Zhan is the so-called "Special Commissioner" for "receiving" the French Concession Court. It is also rumored that Geng Jiaki was also among them when he went to "receive" the court. In addition, there were many newly "appointed" "judges." At that time, Yang Peng, the President of the Higher Court Third Branch, was not at the court. After learning of the incident from his residence, he immediately called the French Concession authorities for help. However, the French Concession authorities were vague and evasive. After several negotiations, he failed to get any support.

Chief Prosecutor Impatiently Transfers Without Authorization

At that time, the French Concession had stationed ten Annamite soldiers and an armored car No. 32 at the entrance of the Higher Court Third Branch. In addition, there were a large number of armed police officers who did not prevent the forced takeover of the court. Qiao Wanxuan, the Chief Prosecutor who had not been to the court for a long time, took the liberty of handling the "transfer." At the same time, the receiving personnel took out more than ten pre-filled "appointment letters" and asked the judges of the court to accept the appointment. They did not leave until about 11:40 AM, and the Higher Court Third Branch changed in nature from then on.

Most Judges Upright and Unyielding

When these people carried out a "takeover" at the Higher Court Third Branch, they immediately notified the Second Court of the Special District by telephone in the name of the Higher Court Third Branch, instructing the President of the court, Chen Mao Xian, to go to the Higher Court Third Branch to handle the transfer. At that time, President Chen did not agree to go, but because of the adverse environment, he only agreed to wait at the Second Special Court. Before long, President Chen quietly left because the attitude of the French authorities was unclear and it was impossible to save the situation. Judges who left with President Chen included Liao Yan, Li Liang, Chen Ziguan, Yu Changzi, Sun Pengxian, Ma Yishu, Qiu Huan Ying, Zhu Chuzhe, Jiang Liquan, and others. It was also learned that at about 11:00 AM yesterday, the "clerk of the Higher Court Third Branch" called the Second Special Court, saying that they would come to "take over" in the afternoon.

Second Special Court Occupied in the Afternoon

At 1:10 PM, five cars drove to the front of the Second Special District Local Court, including the aforementioned two Defense Forces registered cars and three black-plated registered cars of Sun Shaokang with registration number 11103. Six Japanese plainclothes personnel and more than ten Chinese, including Sun Shaokang, rushed into the Second Special District Local Court. At that time, Sun Shaokang also hired a Xiang Sheng dispatch car with registration number 17073 to bring tea and refreshments to the court for hospitality. Thus, the Second Special Court, like the Higher Court Third Branch, also changed in nature.

Second Special Prison Changed Accordingly

The Second Special Court Prison, located near the Second Special Court, opposite the Legal Advisory Office of the French Concession Council on Massenet Road, was also requested by two Japanese, Huang Yaqiang, who served as the deputy warden in the court, and six or seven other Chinese, along with French police officers and Dugen, the Chief Advisor of the French Concession, to "transfer" the prison at about 3:00 PM yesterday. Warden Zhao Xinyu happened to be ill in bed and, forced by circumstances, "transferred" the seals, public funds, guard firearms, and prisoner lists. Huang Yaqiang was acting as the "Warden."

More People Will Withdraw Today

As for the "appointment letters" for this new location, (1) those on the Higher Court Third Branch side included Qiao Wanxuan as "President of the Higher Court Third Branch," Liu Zhaofu as "Chief Prosecutor," Wang Jian as "President of the Civil Court," and Tan Liming as "President of the Criminal Court." (2) Those on the Second Special Court side included Sun Shaokang as "President," Zhou Darin as "Chief Prosecutor," Zhang Mingsheng as "President of the Civil Court" (according to another source, Zhang left the court upon hearing the news), and Yuan Xiaogen as "President of the Criminal Court." In addition, the "judges" and "prosecutors" of the other two courts were also given pre-filled "appointment letters." However, it is not yet known who accepted these "appointments." It is widely believed that many judges and prosecutors will uphold the central government today and prepare to withdraw. The colleagues in the Second Special Prison will also withdraw from today. In addition, all the bailiffs of the Second Special Court expressed their unwillingness to continue in their positions yesterday.

Security Tightened, Searches Thorough

The French Concession authorities had long heard of the great changes that took place in the two courts in the French Concession yesterday and did not reject them. At that time, the French authorities stationed ten Annamite soldiers in addition to the original No. 32 heavy armored car at the lane entrance of the Higher Court Third Branch on West End Avenue. A large number of police officers were also stationed at both ends of West End Avenue, such as the intersection of Rue du Pere Froc and Avenue Albert, and searched pedestrians passing by. As for the front of the Second Special Court, an armored car No. 17 was parked. An armored car No. 23 was parked in front of the Second Special Prison at the intersection of Rue Massenet. In addition, a large number of armed police officers were stationed on the surrounding roads to guard and search vehicles and pedestrians.

American Newspaper Reporter Prevented from Taking Photos

When the Higher Court Third Branch was "taken over," Xu Huazhi, a reporter for the English-language China Press, went to investigate. When she passed by the court on West End Avenue, she was searched by the detectives guarding the court four times. Afterwards, when Xu took out her camera to take pictures of the court, she was stopped by the French police and arrested. She was taken to the police station and released after it was discovered that her photos had not been taken. However, when reporters from the Pingming News Agency went to inspect the Second Special Court on Rue Hua Li, they saw several Japanese newspaper reporters repeatedly taking pictures of the court, and the French police did not stop them.

### North Jiangxi Road Further Reinforced with Steel

Yesterday afternoon, Japanese marines were seen again erecting barbed wire along North Jiangxi Road.

### Yunnan-Burma Road Stops Commercial Cargo, Military Transport Frequent, Commercial Transport Temporarily Suspended

Since the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road on the 18th of this month, military transport has been frequent. A large number of military supplies and ordered military equipment detained in Rangoon are still awaiting shipment in batches. According to visitors from the Southwest, the transport vehicles on this road are serving day and night without stopping for a moment. Therefore, it is necessary to restrict the carriage of commercial goods to avoid hindering military affairs and to facilitate the inspection of contraband. Yesterday's report that the road restricted freight transport referred only to commercial goods and did not mean that general freight transport was generally restricted.

### Rumors of Ha Na and Fei Kang Liners Detained Again by Japanese Warships

Yesterday, news spread in the shipping industry that the Ha Na and Fei Kang liners were again detained by Japanese warships off the coast of Wenzhou. There has been no telegram from the Far Eastern Company and Lu Lin Yanghang, so it has not been confirmed.

### The Seventh Term of Low-Priced Rice Sales Ends Early; Rice Supply Insufficient, Ending One Day Early

The Shanghai Price Stabilization Committee has held six terms of low-priced foreign rice sales. The seventh term just started on the 1st of this month (originally each term was 20 days, but the rice supply for this term was only 28,000 bags, insufficient for 20 days). It was scheduled to end on the 19th, so the total number of bags for the seventh term is 208,000 bags (30,000 bags per term, with 180,000 bags already sold in the six terms, plus 28,000 bags for this term). It is estimated that each 30,000 bags can generate sales of 690,000 to 720,000 yuan, and the total sales for the seven terms will be 4,795,500 to 5,004,000 yuan. 400,000 poor people benefited each term, and over 2.8 million people benefited from the seven terms.

### Postal Remittance Limits in Pingjin, Henan, and Shandong; Remittances Limited to 200 Yuan Per Day in Each Region

Except for the Wusong, Songjiang, Taicang, Haimen, Chongming, and Kunshan bureaus, all inland branches under the Shanghai Postal Administration are not allowed to issue remittances to the following postal regions.

### British Community Donates for Armistice Day

Next Monday is Armistice Day, also known as Remembrance Day. The British community in Shanghai, under the order of the British United Services Association, will not hold any commemorative ceremonies. Half of the proceeds from the flower sale on that day will be transferred to the Central British War Fund for the use of the Red Cross. At 8:30 AM, wreaths will be laid at the Armistice Day Memorial. As for individual members of the British community, they will not lay wreaths separately, but will convert the price of the flowers they intended to lay into a donation to the Central British War Fund. No commemorative services will be held on that day, but a special ceremony will be held at the Community Church on Kiukiang Road the day before. All other gatherings, such as dinners and concerts, will be suspended. On that day, all British community members will wear flowers to commemorate the glorious martyrs.

### Japanese Side Implements Controls; Importers Must Pay a Security Deposit; Exporters Must Pay a Deposit

According to the English-language "Finance & Commerce," the Japanese will soon implement controls on import trade in Central China and Shanghai. Merchants can only purchase goods from Japanese groups, and they cannot be transported to occupied areas. Transactions must use Japanese military scrip, and merchants must pay a cash deposit to restrict the transportation of goods to various locations. Regarding export trade, the Japanese will also find ways to obtain the foreign exchange of exporters, and export trade must also pay a deposit. The reason for this is not yet clear, but under the current circumstances, it is unlikely to be implemented in Shanghai. However, Shanghai is surrounded by their control, and if merchants in Shanghai do not agree to the Japanese method, they will be isolated from the occupied areas and can only operate in a corner of the International Settlement. At the same time, the Japanese are planning to organize the "Far East Bristle Trading Company" with a capital of one million yuan to control the export trade of bristles in Central China. The export of bristles in North China has always been managed exclusively by Mitsui & Co., and foreign merchants of third-party nationalities have no way to obtain sufficient supply, and the foreign exchange from export is also pocketed by the Japanese. Central China will also follow the current method in North China, and a foreign exchange income will flow from the open market into the hands of the Japanese. If foreign merchants want to continue to engage in bristle trade, there must be other conditions for the disposal of the US dollars obtained from export. Currently, two-thirds of the exported bristles are shipped to the United States, and 25% are shipped to the United Kingdom.

### Promote National Savings for Reconstruction and Conscript Winter Clothing; Simultaneously Held in Shanghai; National Savings for Reconstruction Week Starts Tomorrow; The Weather Is Cold and Winter Clothing Is Urgently Needed

The National Savings for Reconstruction Movement Committee has issued an order to all parts of the country to hold a National Savings for Reconstruction Movement expanded publicity week from the 10th to the 16th of this month. Various groups in Shanghai have recently been ordered by the Central Party Headquarters to promote it unanimously in order to cultivate the virtue of thrift and achieve the goal of national reconstruction. However, due to the special environment of the Shanghai Settlement area, postal remittance bureaus and the four branches of the Central, Bank of China, Communications, and Agricultural Banks did not issue National Savings for Reconstruction Certificates.

Method of Purchasing Certificates

Therefore, citizens who want to purchase savings certificates can entrust various banks and bureaus to purchase them from Hong Kong. Those who want to open National Savings for Reconstruction accounts can directly apply to various banks and bureaus. National currency of one yuan or more can be used to open an account, and deposits can be made at any time thereafter. In addition to the respective banks and bureaus responsible for the savings money and certificates to the depositors, the government guarantees the safety of the principal and interest. The unit of the National Savings for Reconstruction Certificate is national currency, but savings may be stored in foreign currency and gold and silver. If stored in foreign currency at maturity, the principal and interest will still be repaid in foreign currency. If stored in gold and silver, it will be converted into legal tender according to the supplementary measures of the Ministry of Finance's exchange of legal tender, and a handling fee will be added and included in the principal. Savings certificates and deposit books are specially allowed to be used as substitutes when public officials pay security deposits. At the same time, the government specially allows exemption from income tax on interest income.

Winter Clothing Donation

The movement to raise money for winter clothing, launched by various circles in Shanghai, has been extended by one month to the end of this month after a joint request to extend the donation period and a telegram reply from the Chongqing Donation Headquarters. All circles are working harder than ever on fundraising, and various public associations, public and private organizations, schools, banks, and other collection agencies have been working more intensively recently. Given that the weather in Shanghai has turned cold recently, the severe cold in the future can be imagined. Therefore, based on the current situation of enthusiastic donations, the hope of exceeding one million yuan should be within expectations. All circles have also decided to expand the promotion of the National Savings for Reconstruction Movement on the 12th of this month, the anniversary of the birth of the national father, and the anniversary of the Western Withdrawal of the National Army three years later. This is so that the front-line soldiers can have winter clothes and equipment to get through the harsh winter.

In addition, since the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association published an appeal to all walks of life to solicit winter clothes, many people have responded and donated money. However, the severe cold has suddenly arrived, and the relief of the old and young refugees in the various shelters cannot be delayed. Therefore, the association hopes that enthusiastic people from all walks of life can continue to solicit donations to complete this great charitable cause.

### U.S. Marine Corps Anniversary; Birthday Banquet; Held This Afternoon

Tomorrow is the 165th anniversary of the founding of the U.S. Marine Corps. Every year on this day, the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai must hold a grand celebration and commemoration. The Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet and the Commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment will conduct a review. The soldiers of the team will also play a ball game with friendly teams to determine the annual championship. However, the situation this year is special. Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet, has gone to Nicaragua, so there is no commemorative ceremony. Even the exercises of the Fourth Marine Regiment are unlikely to be held. Because tomorrow is a Sunday, for the sake of convenience, a banquet will be held this afternoon at the Shanghai Volunteer Corps drill ground on Foochow Road to celebrate the Navy "Birthday Anniversary". All officers and soldiers of the U.S. Marine Corps will participate at that time. Colonel Baker, Rear Admiral Glassford, and the Commander-in-Chief and all members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will also be invited to participate. Senior officials of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department will also attend the banquet on time, and there will be boxing and other programs to add to the fun.

### Two Settlements; Expand Safety Movement; Excellent Results Last Year Reduced Accidents; This Year's Universal Publicity Seeks Greater Perfection

According to the "North-China Daily News," the police of the Public Settlement and the French Settlement are cooperating to carry out the "Safety First" movement in order to reduce traffic accidents in the settlements. The movement, which was originally scheduled to be held in June, has now been extended to start on the 18th of this month and end on the 27th. The implementation method is roughly the same as last year.

Screening Films for Propaganda

The authorities have newly filmed a "Safety First" film, which will be screened in various cinemas in the city, with explanations in the Shanghai dialect. A special truck has also been prepared, equipped with a projector and other equipment, to go to various factories to screen the "Safety First" film. At the same time, a phonograph record will be used to explain the meaning of each scene in the film so that workers can understand the purpose of the movement.

Distributing One Million Leaflets

In addition, propaganda banners will be posted in prominent locations in the settlement, and one million leaflets will be distributed to citizens. The Traffic Division of the police departments of the two settlements will also send letters to all car owners in the city, with a pamphlet explaining how to avoid accidents. Car owners will also attach a paper flag to the windshield and two long flags to the side windows, which must not be attached to the rear window.

Chinese Students Mobilized to Assist

The "Safety First" movement held by the two settlements last year achieved excellent results, with accidents and casualties reduced by 22%. The authorities hope that this year's movement will be even more perfect. A large number of Chinese students have volunteered to serve, and they will wear special armbands and stand at intersections to explain prevention methods to pedestrians in order to avoid accidental injuries. At the same time, slogan flags will be distributed to various rickshaws, bicycles, and other light vehicles and pasted in conspicuous places.

Radio Stations Will Also Cooperate

However, the propaganda posters printed this year are the same as those used last year, and their number is far less than last year, because they are only pasted in the shop windows of Nanjing Road and other thoroughfares. The authorities also plan to obtain the cooperation of Shanghai radio stations to broadcast and elaborate on the importance of "Safety First" in order to ensure the greatest success of the movement. The implementation procedures on the French Settlement side are exactly the same as those in the Public Settlement.

### French Tram Company; Rumor of Price Increase Tomorrow

Adding 30% to Current Prices: Since the French Electricity and Water Company had its water and electricity fees approved by the French Municipal Council, it has been implemented on the 6th of this month. It is rumored that the fare increase for trams has also been completed, and it is scheduled to be announced and implemented tomorrow (the 10th). The amount of the increase is 30% of the current fare. Currently, the lowest fare for the French tram is two cents for third class and three cents for first class. If the price increase is implemented, the lowest fare for first class will be four cents and three cents for third class.

### Group Rice Purchase; Responses Are Enthusiastic; Abundant Supply, Rice Prices Rise Instead; Hong Kong Approves Daily Shipment of 5,000 Bags

Yesterday, the rice market, despite abundant arrivals and full reserves, rebounded by more than one yuan per picul. The price of No. 1 Saigon rice per picul had already fallen to 61 yuan. After the rebound in the past two days, it has reached 64 yuan. The general public is worried. If the relevant authorities do not take measures to suppress it, the future of the people's food supply is worrying.

Hong Kong Exports

Yesterday, it was learned that although Hong Kong is not a rice-producing area, it is adjacent to Nanyang, making it a hub for foreign rice transportation. Previously, due to the tense situation, rice exports were prohibited. Later, as the situation eased slightly, the ban was lifted. Now, it is stipulated that the daily export quota for rice is 5,000 bags, and the amount shipped to Shanghai reaches more than 2,000 bags per day. It is transported only by the Nanyang liners of the British Taikoo and Jardine shipping companies, which greatly benefits the supply of rice in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's "Yuezhou" wheel, which arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, was loaded with 2,167 bags of foreign rice shipped from Hong Kong and unloaded at the Bund of the French Settlement yesterday.

Group Registration

The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association has been making every effort to promote group rice purchases in order to replenish the amount stored in Shanghai. Twenty-seven batches have already been handled. Yesterday, a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency learned that merchants have been flocking to the association on the third floor of the YMCA on Montauban Road to inquire about rice ordering procedures. It is said that the association is currently handling the 28th batch of group rice purchases so that they can order from overseas as soon as possible. The Ningbo Association in Shanghai has also persuaded its members to participate in group rice purchases. Many fellow villagers have gone to the association to collect registration forms and fill them out to order rice.

### Zhejiang Epidemic Prevention Personnel Arrive in Ningbo to Assist in Eradicating the Plague

(3) The Yin County government, in order to step up the implementation of epidemic prevention, specially convened a meeting of important officials and doctors from various hospitals at 4:00 PM yesterday to review the situation. Secretary Zhang Hongbin, the chairman, decided to establish an epidemic prevention office, and the staff members were assigned. Every day from 7:30 AM to 11:30 AM and from 1:30 PM to 5:30 PM, they will concentrate on working in the county government. If there are any emergencies, they will be convened temporarily.

### Insurance Industry and the Shanghai Municipal Council Commemorate Hu Yongqi

Yesterday, various groups such as the Shanghai University Youth Association and the Ningshao Insurance Company held a memorial service for Mr. Hu Yongqi, Chairman of the Shanghai Insurance Industry Association, at the Moore Memorial Church. There were many elegiac couplets sent by Yuan Ludeng, Fang Jiaobo, and various groups. After a religious ceremony, silent flower offering, singing, and scripture reading, the body was sent to the Hongqiao Cemetery for burial. The funeral was somber and grand with white horses and plain cars.

According to a special dispatch from Shanghai on the 8th by the United Press of America, Lieutenant Commander Jordan, the business officer of the American ship Luzon, married Miss Kirk at the home of U.S. Consul General Rawley here the day before yesterday.

### Gong Hongzhao Died of Illness; Concealed Assets While Gasping for Breath; Shen Zhujiu Opposes Limited Inheritance; Yesterday's Hearing Included Testimony and Verification

Xi Hongzhao, a native of Chongming and former principal of the Zhengxing Girls' Middle School on Qianfu Road, was the chairman of the Chongming Boji Pawnshop and practiced law in Shanghai. Xi and Shen Zhujiu, a wealthy merchant from Chongming, were related through marriage. Shen's eldest daughter, Yaomei, is twenty-eight years old this year and is Xi's cousin. Yaomei once worked as a teacher in Shanghai, and Xi was the principal of Zhengxing Girls' Middle School. They were both in the education field and

were of similar age.

The relationship between the cousins developed into a physical love affair. Xi already had a wife, Gu, and children. Yaomei, due to her entanglement with Xi, willingly became Xi's concubine. In July of the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, she stole ten gold pounds, several taels of jewelry, and a large sum of cash from her father and eloped with Xi. That year, a lawsuit was filed in the Second Special District Court, resulting in Xi Hongzhao being sentenced to three months in prison and his lawyer's license being revoked. Shen Zhujiu was also fined for defamation, but Yaomei continued to

cohabit with Gong.

Because Yaomei was of age, Shen Zhujiu could not interfere with her marriage. Xi Hongzhao died in his Shanghai residence on June 124th of last year. His household was managed by his wife, Gu. Although Yaomei lived in Xi's house, she was often ridiculed. On September 18th of last year, Gu suddenly petitioned the court for limited inheritance, claiming that Xi Hongzhao had few assets and only a 500 yuan share in the Boji Pawnshop. Shen Zhujiu, due to Xi Hongzhao owing him a considerable amount of debt, and his daughter Yao央 being unable to bear the ridicule, also

returned to the Gong family.

Therefore, Shen Zhujiu recently hired lawyer Yu Chengxiu to file a petition in the First Special District Court, requesting confirmation that Xi Gu氏's petition for limited inheritance of Xi Hongzhao's estate was invalid and that Gu had concealed Xi Hongzhao's assets. Judge Tao Dejun opened a civil court yesterday to summon the defendant, Xi Gu氏. Due to illness, Xi Gu氏 did not appear in court and appointed lawyer Lu Jiating to represent her. The plaintiff, Shen Zhujiu, along with lawyer Yu Chengxiu, appeared in court and stated that the deceased, Xi Hongzhao, had seduced and eloped with the plaintiff's daughter, Shen Yao, taking away gold pounds, gold bracelets, and cash. Although a lawsuit was filed in the Second Special District Court,

the items were not recovered.

The items taken away were hidden by Xi Hongzhao in a safe deposit box at the Four Banks Savings Society. Xi Hongzhao's personal assets were also hidden in that safe deposit box. The defendant, Xi Gu氏, petitioned for limited inheritance on September 18th of this year. Why did she repeatedly open the safe deposit box on November 3rd, 7th, 8th, and 28th of last year? Xi Hongzhao had a share capital of 8,000 yuan in the Boji Pawnshop. Why did she say it was only 500 yuan? It is evident that the defendant intended to conceal assets. The court verified the testimony and ordered a change to summon witnesses for further questioning.

### Son Ill and Unemployed; Mother and Daughter Commit Suicide; Both Die from Poisoning

Xu Yang氏, an old woman from Yangzhou, resided in the front room of Building 27, Alley 280, Sapore Road. She was sixty years old. Her son, Xiao Yun, had recently become unemployed and was bedridden at Guangci Hospital. He had been ill for a long time and was unable to make ends meet due to financial difficulties. Xu committed suicide with her twenty-two-year-old daughter, Xu Lubao, on the night of the seventh, taking poison together. At four o'clock yesterday morning, the male servant, Sun You, heard moaning sounds and entered the room to investigate. The smell of poison was overwhelming. There were two empty bottles on the table. Xu and her daughter were unconscious and pale. He immediately reported to the police, who sent them to Guangpu Hospital. However, they died before they could be treated. The patrol police sent the bodies to the coroner's office to await examination.

### Modern Girl Jumps to Her Death

Yesterday afternoon at four o'clock, a middle-aged man jumped to his death from a window on the very high floor of the building at No. 201, Maisi West Love Road in the Shazui Concession. He fell to the ground from a great height, instantly breaking his head, splattering his brains, and dying. Passersby discovered him and reported to the police. The police dispatched detectives to investigate and then transported the body to Guangci Hospital for examination.

Yesterday at 7:15 PM, a modern girl (in her twenties) suddenly jumped out of a window on the third floor of an apartment at No. 101, Mai Liangxi Love Road in the French Concession, attempting suicide. She fell into the road and suffered extremely severe head injuries, dying at the scene. Later, Chinese police arrived at the scene and rushed her to Guangci Hospital for examination. The detectives found a note on her person, which read "No. 5, Alley 534, Xiafei Road." The detectives immediately went to the address to investigate, but the people at that address said they did not know her. The police are still investigating the girl's name.

### Yin Junong, Owner of Lengxiang Pavilion, Sues Husband for Divorce; Demands Return of More Than 20,000 Yuan in Dowry; Both Parties Absent from Court, Hearing Adjourned

Yin Junong, nicknamed Si, the daughter of the late Shanghai pediatrician Yin Shoutian, is twenty-six years old. She resides at No. 3, Alley 65, Lei Shangda Road. She is a passionate Kunqu opera enthusiast and is known by her stage name "Owner of Lengxiang Pavilion." In January of the twenty-something year of the Republic of China, she was introduced by Xia Yingtang and Xie Zenghe and married Chen Zonghui (twenty-four years old this year, father's name is Qiongliang), the son of Chen Weiquan, a major antique and jewelry merchant from Nanke, at the New Asia Restaurant auditorium on North Sichuan Road. Initially, their love was strong, and they had two daughters, the elder named Qiulai (five years old) and the younger named Meimei (four years old). However, Junong spent

too much time indulging in Kunqu opera

outside the home, more than at home. Zonghui repeatedly advised her, but Yin acted insincerely, leading to disagreements. From then on, the couple's feelings gradually deteriorated, becoming irreconcilable. Yin returned to her mother's home. Although Chen rented a Western-style house at No. 593, Lafayette Road, to bring Yin home to live with him, she refused. Chen then frequented singing and dancing halls, developing an entanglement with Zhou Lianfang (nineteen years old, from Taizhou), a dancer at the Xianle Dance Hall. Yin discovered this and reported it to the French police at 5:30 AM on March 28th of this year,

who caught them in the act

and took them to the Criminal Court 8 of the Second Special Court. Judge Li Weiju sentenced Chen Zonghui for adultery and Zhou Lianfang for illicit sexual relations, each to three months in prison with a two-year suspended sentence. The appeal period has long passed, and the case is final. Therefore, Yin Junong recently hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against Chen Zonghui and his father, Chen Weiquan, for divorce, custody, and the return of her dowry. The claim is divided into three parts: (1) to approve the divorce of Chen Zonghui and Yin Junong; (2) the two daughters, Qiulai and Meimei, to be under the

plaintiff's custody;

(3) to return the dowry and all clothing. If they cannot be returned, the two defendants should jointly compensate 20,870.08 yuan in national currency. As for the alimony, the original intention was to request a payment of 126,000 yuan, but due to lack of funds for the litigation, the request was reserved. The court accepted the case, and Judge Li Liang opened Civil Court 7 yesterday morning to hear the case. The two defendants appointed lawyers to represent them in court and filed a counterclaim, requesting that the plaintiff's suit be dismissed and that Qiulai and Meimei be under Chen Zonghui's custody. The court verified the arguments, and because the two parties were not present, it ordered a rescheduling for the morning of the 19th for further hearing.

### Old Woman Encounters Robbery, Kills a Thief; Deceased Thief Had Been Sentenced Eight Times

At 8:30 yesterday morning, an old woman from Ningbo, Wang Zhou氏, was riding in a rickshaw when three robbers suddenly jumped out from the roadside as she passed the entrance of the Slaughterhouse Company at the intersection of Mintini Yin Road and Pi Shaonai Road. They stopped the rickshaw, and one robber used a gun to threaten her. They robbed the old woman of a gold ring on her hand (valued at more than 100 yuan) and fled together. Yang immediately shouted "Catch the thieves!" At that time, a Russian police officer No. 25 from the French police station happened to pass by and bravely chased after them. When he was about to catch up, one of the thieves tried to open fire to resist arrest. The Russian police officer immediately fired seven shots in succession, hitting the thief in the head, who fell to the ground and died. The other two thieves took the opportunity to escape into Alley 287 on Pi Shaonai Road and disappeared without a trace. The body of the deceased thief was taken to the coroner's office by the police station.

### Where are Women Going? (1) Women Should Return to the Home

— Qizhai

(II) Women and Psychology: In addition to the "special ability to give birth," women also have a "special ability for motherly love" psychologically. Like the "special ability to give birth," this is a kind of "racial instinct." If women did not have the "special ability for motherly love," mankind could not grow up and would become extinct. Women are impelled by the "special ability for motherly love" and naturally wish to give up everything and sacrifice everything to be the protectors of their children. Therefore, Dr. Wang Wanbai once called "Mothers are the first-class nurses in the world." This is a unique need of women's instincts, like drinking, eating, and sex, that cannot be stopped. Hollingworth and Poffenberger believe that "one of the most cruel punishments in life is solitary confinement." I dare say: "One of the most cruel punishments for women is not allowing women to love their children."

(III) Women and Society: Society is a group of people, and the unit of the group is the individual. Women are the people who produce many individuals who become a group, so women are the "mother of society." Since the unit of society is the individual, the good or bad of society depends entirely on the good or bad of the individual. If the "mother of society" cannot obtain a reasonable environment (an environment that meets the physiological and psychological needs of women), it will definitely affect the health and intelligence of children, and society will not be good.

### Women Should Go to Society

— Yi Hui

(II) Women and Psychology: There are no parents in the world who do not love their children. But many people think that loving children is a special ability of mothers. In fact, the reason why mothers seem to be especially protective of their children is mostly because mothers have more contact with their children than fathers do. Similarly, a mother loves her two biological children whom she cares for herself more than those cared for by a nanny. From a psychological point of view, every woman has her own different personality and strengths. We cannot assume that all mothers are good at raising children. A child's growth cannot rely solely on motherly love. Reasonable educational methods are just as important as motherly love. Moreover, women who are employed can still love their children. In the advanced countries that are most committed to the construction of nurseries, many places are posted with a slogan: "Nothing can replace a mother's milk and a mother's love!" The children in nurseries are not children in orphanages. After their parents finish their day's work, they can all go back to enjoy family happiness and parental love as much as possible. Who says that employed women cannot love their children?

(III) Women and Society: The good or bad of individuals can affect society. The good or bad of society can also affect individuals. Therefore, on the one hand, women must use excellent education to make children play a good role in society. On the other hand, she must also work hard to directly transform society, because a progressive society can have a good influence on children, and a dark society can also make children degenerate. As Mr. Wu said, society is composed of groups. But we must also remember that women themselves are part of the group. They account for half of the crowd. Their contribution to society is by no means merely indirect. They are the indispensable direct force to promote social progress.

### Younger Brother's Dream

— Liusha

Free Talk once published an article entitled "My Younger Brother." I was extremely moved by the progress of his younger brother's life. I couldn't help but start writing because I thought of my own younger brother. But to my shame, my younger brother is neither as smart nor as progressive as that younger brother. Moreover, he is a stupid young man with a lot of vanity and a strong spirit of Ah Q. I didn't want to expose him because it's a very undignified thing for me. However, reading Lei Xingjun's warning: "We hate the darkness, but we are not afraid of the darkness." made me feel that the regressive and harmful trend needs to be severely punished and constantly attacked. Therefore, my nonsense may be of some practical benefit to readers.

Without further ado, let me introduce my younger brother!

He is a middle school student, not very good at learning, and his physique is not very healthy either. However, he is very proud and loves to show off in public.

There was a time when he spent almost half the day admiring his own appearance. He once boasted that his face and hair not only closely resembled the movie star Mei Xi, but also somewhat resembled the literary hero Yu Dafu. His joy exceeded his age, but I could only secretly pity his naivety and frivolity.

He has great hopes, but they are just dreams. He has great ambitions, but his abilities and skills are pitifully low. He has dreamed of a happy heaven, fame, money, career, promotion… But the vicious reality shattered his sweet dreams and could not fulfill his wishes. But he kept dreaming. He often said: I have to work hard in the future, starting tomorrow. But he has never suffered, and he has never struggled resolutely.

His main flaw! is that he only has fantasies and never touches reality. We must recognize that in the process of the birth of a new China, this spirit will inevitably decline and be eliminated. The most tragic thing is that he is not alone. He represents the characteristics of a group of petty bourgeoisie and the typical spirit of Ah Q; and he is the direct blood and veins of most urban students. If he can be unbiased and open his eyes to face reality, he will not think that I am overstating it. This should be regarded as a serious problem, belonging to the mental illness aspect of society, worthy of attention and discussion by scholars.

How should we save this group of young people?

### We Are Still Young

— Yan Zheng

We are still young.

We are the crystallization of light, heat, and power. The fire of youth is burning in our hearts!

We sing praises, sing praises of freedom and justice. We must sing praises of the truth, the eternal and unchanging absolute truth!

We also criticize. We raise the gun of liberation, aiming at all the ugliness, violence, and shamelessness in the world…, and declare their death sentence in an instant!

We are singers of the universe. Also sharpshooters.

The progress of history is curvilinear and upward. Occasional storms and temporary darkness cannot make us depressed, decadent, or disappear.

Plants grow tortuously under the stones. We are the brave petrels in the storm! The patience of a camel, the ferocity of a lion, the agility of a monkey!…

Not the obedience of a sheep, the greed of a jackal, the carefulness of a bat!…

For ourselves, for the motherland, and for mankind!

We are still young.

Hawthorne Case

### Where the Dancing Queen Ends Up

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Ten The Shoe Problem

Ni Jinshou said to us: "Song Quan is currently in the West District Police Station. This news is very brief, and I don't know the details. Mr. Hawthorne, can you come with me to the police station to ask what's going on?"

Hawthorne pondered for a moment before saying, "I think I'll go back. If there's any news, let me know. I'm concerned about Hesheng."

Ni Jinshou nodded and said, "Okay, then I'll go back to the station first. As soon as I get news about Hesheng, I'll tell you." After saying that, he jumped into a rickshaw nearby.

When Hawthorne and I returned to No. 77, Aiwen Road, it was getting dark, and the street lights were on. As soon as we entered the office, Shi Gui handed Hawthorne a letter. Hawthorne took off his hat and coat and opened the letter under the electric light on his desk. I also leaned over to look. It was sent by Lu Jiansheng, and a check for 1,000 yuan was attached to the letter. Although the letter was only a few sentences, the wording was very humble.

The letter said:

"Mr. Hawthorne: Lilan died tragically. I feel very guilty. I am grateful that you are responsible for the investigation. I have already answered everything you asked this morning with sincerity. I sincerely hope that you will understand my humble feelings. If the real culprit can be brought to justice and the grievances of the deceased can be slightly cleared, I will be grateful for your great kindness. Attached is a small gift, which is not worth much. I will visit again to thank you in the near future. Sincerely, Lu Jiansheng, on this day" Hawthorne threw the letter on the desk at random, with a slight contemptuous smile on the corner of his mouth. He leaned back in the swivel chair, stretched, but did not express any opinion.

I smiled and said, "You don't need to pay for Ah Gen's expenses out of your own pocket anymore." (169)

Rehashing Old Stories

### Napoleon's Invasion of Italy

— Bitter Li

The greatness of music is universally acknowledged. It not only cultivates temperament but can even cure illnesses. Having just read the article "Memories of the Occupation of Oslo," I couldn't help but recall an old story about Napoleon's invasion of Italy. I remember a story in Feng Zikai's translation of "Children's Music" that shows the profound relationship between the power of music and military affairs.

Speaking of Napoleon, most people think of him as just a war expert, but it wasn't quite like that. When going to battle, he often ordered his soldiers, saying what kind of music was not allowed and what kind should be played loudly. So, Napoleon often chose the military music himself. When the enemy attacked, he specifically ordered his soldiers to play music loudly.

In 1797, he was about to cross the treacherous Alps and invade Italy. It is said that only two people in ancient times had invaded Italy: one was Hannibal, the great general of Carthage on the North African coast, 2,000 years ago; the other was Napoleon.

He had to cross snow-covered cliffs and precipices. Napoleon's troops were originally strong and brave, but when they reached really dangerous places, they couldn't move forward. Seeing this situation, Napoleon immediately chose lively music and ordered the musicians to play. The soldiers, hearing this interesting music, became a hundred times more courageous and finally were able to cross these dangerous mountains and attack Italy.

### "The Compassionate Doctor"

— Wangsun of Chu Water

Is a movie about a doctor, starring "Louis Calhern" and "Lana Turner," produced by "MGM," and showing at the "Dahua" cinema.

It tells the audience:

"Dr. Gillespie," a famous diagnostician at New York's Central Hospital, is a crippled doctor with a bad temper; everyone is afraid of him. Only a young doctor, "Dr. Kildare," is willing to get close to him, and he also believes that "Kildare" can be his "successor." Once, "Kildare" misdiagnosed a patient. "Gillespie" knew this was entirely due to lack of experience, so he sent "Kildare" to serve in a poor people's clinic, and sent a girl "Manny" along to report on his service status at any time. He served very well. One day, "Nick," who was mistakenly injured, asked him for treatment. He removed the bullet and treated him wholeheartedly. "Nick's" sister, "Rosalie," is very beautiful, and "Kildare" falls in love with her. Based on "Manny's" report, "Gillespie" knew that he was secretly treating "Nick," who may have committed a crime, so he advised him not to and to hand him over to the police immediately, otherwise the doctor's position would be revoked by the government. He refused. Later, he was tricked into going home. After he returned to New York to treat "Nick," "Nick" was arrested by the police, and he was also fired from the hospital. He believed that Nick was not a criminal, but he could not find the real culprit to clear his name. From "Nick's" mouth, he learned that a gangster was involved in the crime, so he tried to catch him and hand him over to the police. "Gillespie" was very happy to hear this news, because from then on "Kildare" could resume his "old life." He also knew that "Kildare" was obsessed with "Rosalie," so he visited this girl himself, only to find out that she did not love him. Just then, "Kildare" came to see her, and he suddenly realized something. He left "Rosalie," returned to his position as "Gillespie's" assistant, and immersed himself in the affection of his companion girl "Manny," immersed himself in sacred work.

I think the performance of "Lionel Barrymore" as "Gillespie" is better. The demeanor of that kind of doctor is very experienced and vivid! Especially in expressing "irascibility," the loud shouts and small movements are "pure perfection" everywhere. "Lana Turner's" "Rosalie" and "Laraine Day's" "Manny" are both appropriate. On the contrary, "Louis Calhern," who played "Kildare," did not achieve anything special, although he did not "fail his duty"!

What we should pay the most attention to is the technique of the director "Harold, S. Bucquet." Although it is extremely small and trivial actions, he never relaxes casually. He always puts in a lot of thought. After watching it, we feel light, vivid, and lively. We can imagine that "dozing off" during directing is absolutely impossible.

### "The Tragedy of Miss Lan"

Yesterday I went to the Qingyun Drama Society to watch the rehearsal of "The Tragedy of Miss Lan," and the results were very good. The role of Miss Lan is played by Miss Zhuang Zhong. It is said that since the first dialogue, she seems to have been obsessed with finding reference materials, studying and researching. Now it is almost the New Year, but she is still working hard with dissatisfaction. Indeed, her success is not accidental. Her acting skills have two advantages: (1) The control of breathing is very natural. (2) The dividing line between the expression of emotions is very clear. Especially in the third act, the blank expression when she killed Dick was truly profound. At the end, Miss Lan cried out miserably. The sound of crying was like a sharp knife piercing my heart, moving me to tears. Director Jiang Jingjun humbly asked me for criticism. In fact, what else can I say besides celebrating the future of the amateur theater troupe?

I heard that they have scheduled an experimental performance at the Lafayette Theater at 10:00 tomorrow morning.
