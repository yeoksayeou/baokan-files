### Large Numbers of Japanese Planes Raid Sichuan Yesterday Morning; Two Shot Down in Suburban Areas; Chinese Air Force Fights Bravely, Unleashing Fierce Fire; Japanese Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Non-Military Zones in Suburbs

Chongqing: 136 Japanese aircraft, divided into four groups, invaded Sichuan Province at 10:50 AM on the morning of the 26th. Two of the groups flew to Hejiang, Qijiang, and Yongchuan, wreaking havoc before being repelled by the Chinese Air Force, scattering in retreat. The other two groups, comprising 72 planes, intruded into the city's airspace at 1:30 PM in the afternoon. The Chinese Air Force, well-prepared, immediately engaged in a fierce encounter. The Japanese planes initially attempted to resist stubbornly, but were subjected to severe pressure from the Chinese high-altitude aircraft and ground fire. The Japanese indiscriminately dropped dozens of bombs on the outskirts of Chongqing before attempting to flee eastward. The brave Chinese airmen pursued and attacked the second plane in the Japanese formation. The Japanese concentrated their machine-gun fire, resulting in intense firepower. General Gao, showing great courage, increased the intensity of his attacks, damaging the Japanese aircraft. The crippled Japanese plane fell behind and fled southeast. Gao did not relent, pursuing it relentlessly until it reached Xiaoguanyin Bridge (40 kilometers southeast of Chongqing), where he accurately shot it down with machine-gun fire. The Japanese plane immediately exploded, scattering flames and crashing to the ground. Gao, satisfied that his mission was accomplished, returned to base. An inspection of his aircraft revealed that it had been hit by over forty bullets from the Japanese. His bravery and skill in battle were highly praised by the air force commanders. The remaining Japanese planes fled in disarray, pursued relentlessly by the Chinese airmen. As they reached the skies over Qianjiang, another large-scale air battle ensued. The Japanese scattered, seeking escape. The Chinese Air Force, with high morale and utilizing its advantageous position, engaged in a fierce attack, shooting down another Japanese heavy bomber. The surviving Japanese planes finally managed to escape. In this battle, the Chinese Air Force achieved victory, shooting down a total of two Japanese planes and returning safely to base.

Chongqing: At 2:00 PM this afternoon, 71 Japanese planes bombed the outskirts of Chongqing again, destroying many houses and killing over 200 civilians. This air raid was the most horrific since May 4th. The area most severely bombed was Hualong Bridge (transliteration), seven miles west of Chongqing. The exact number of dead and wounded is still unknown, as countless houses were flattened. Many residents were likely crushed or killed by collapsing walls. Red Cross ambulances and stretchers rushed to the bombed area, transporting the wounded to hospitals, working tirelessly through the night. The structures destroyed by the Japanese planes included three newspaper offices, one school, and many public facilities and private residences. There were no military installations in the area, and most of the residents were women and children. Fudan Middle School, which had relocated here from Shanghai, was also destroyed. However, some of the school's young students had left earlier, and the rest had sought shelter in air raid shelters when the alarm sounded. Therefore, no one was injured when the school was damaged. However, two soldiers stationed near the school were wounded by shrapnel. The Chongqing office of the Central Daily News, the printing house of another newspaper, and the courtyard of the Spanish News (transliteration) were all directly hit. Casualties were heaviest in this area. Most of the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes landed outside the city. Several civilian boats on the Jialing River were also sunk. Many officials of the National Government personally went to Hualong Bridge to inspect the disaster and assess the damage. United Press reporters learned that all the wounded had been taken to hospitals in the city, and Mayor Wu Guozhen of Chongqing personally supervised their care. Although the Japanese bombs did not land inside the city, residents of Chongqing were forced to remain in air raid shelters for over four hours. The Chongqing anti-aircraft artillery fired on the Japanese planes as they approached, driving them away. (United Press, 26th dispatch)

Chongqing: This afternoon, approximately one hundred Japanese planes heavily bombed the western suburbs of Chongqing, resulting in many civilian casualties. The city proper and its immediate surroundings were not bombed. An air raid alert was issued around 11:00 AM, reporting that several waves of Japanese planes were flying upriver toward Chongqing. Initially, people believed that the poor weather and visibility would prevent the Japanese planes from reaching Chongqing. However, half an hour later, Chinese reconnaissance planes were patrolling the city's airspace, and the first wave of 36 Japanese bombers was sighted. Around 1:00 PM, the second and third waves of Japanese planes arrived in succession. Visibility was still poor at the time. The Japanese planes were unable to drop bombs from high altitude and were afraid to descend due to anti-aircraft fire. Therefore, the hundred or so Japanese planes circled the city for two hours, waiting for the weather to improve. Shortly after 2:00 PM, the Japanese planes began diving in three waves, dropping bombs in the western suburbs. The Chinese anti-aircraft artillery immediately responded with heavy fire. One of the waves then flew back to its base along the Jialing River. The other two waves attacked Chongqing from the north and south. This was the first time that Japanese planes had dropped bombs within the city limits. (Reuters, 26th dispatch)

Chongqing: Japanese air raids on major cities in Sichuan Province intensified again today. Ninety-nine Japanese bombers flew to various cities in Sichuan Province to bomb them. The outskirts of Chongqing were also bombed, but there were no losses. Seventy-seven of the planes bombing Chongqing flew in two formations. After the Japanese planes were spotted, Chongqing responded with anti-aircraft fire, eventually driving them away completely. The air raid alert in Chongqing lasted for over four hours that day.

Editorial

### Culture and the War of Resistance

This war of resistance by China is a great achievement of the nationalist movement. Even the Japanese, who are our enemies, cannot deny this fact. The Chinese nationalist movement has deep and long-standing roots in history and society. The respect for the King and the expulsion of barbarians in the Spring and Autumn period, the determination of the generals of the Southern Song Dynasty to restore the country, and the efforts of scholars like Gu Yanwu and Huang Zongxi at the end of the Ming Dynasty to preserve what remained and delve into scholarship should all be regarded as specific and microcosmic examples of the early nationalist movement. Furthermore, the nationalist movement led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and his successors has been particularly effective in the recent situation of Chinese being invaded. The New Culture Movement of the past twenty years has made indelible contributions. This cultural movement has awakened the people from a state of ignorance and obscurantism, and has deeply rooted nationalist thought in all corners of society, resulting in China's first nationwide war against foreign aggression. At this time of war, when military affairs are pressing, we should not easily forget the great achievements of the past cultural movement. Moreover, there is a significant practical significance besides historical memories.

The relationship between culture and war, compared to the dark ages of the past and the civilized era of today, clearly shows a huge difference. In the past, wars depended on the physical strength of the people and simple weapons. Culture not only did not help military affairs, but sometimes formed a hateful obstacle. Therefore, at that time, civilized people were often no match for barbarian tribes, and culture itself inevitably suffered curses in war. As the era evolved, wars transformed from a pure contest of physical strength into a comparison of national power and the fruits of civilization. Culture then played an important role everywhere, forming an important condition for victory. Consequently, tribes that relied solely on physical strength were enslaved by so-called civilized countries. In the past forty years, examples such as the Boer War in South Africa, the rebellions in Morocco and Syria, and the recent Italian-Ethiopian War have all provided painful examples of this. Furthermore, from the perspective of modern scientific inventions, the manufacture of lighter-than-air balloons, the success of salt-making alkali, and the invention of tanks were all prompted by the needs of war. Now that the European war has expanded, reports of new and unusual German weapons have repeatedly appeared in newspapers. Although the degree of credibility is questionable, there is no doubt that scientists of the great powers are now exerting their intelligence to find ways to win. Other things, such as spiritual motivation and the promotion of hatred of the enemy, must be applied from the cultural perspective. These facts all prove that in modern warfare, cultural efforts are as important as military, political, and economic efforts.

From a modern perspective, China cannot deny its own backwardness; however, China is by no means the same as those countries without history or that do not seek progress. On one hand, the old national heritage has rich treasures, and on the other hand, the recent cultural and scientific movement also has glorious achievements. In this extraordinary era of survival, we should not only be content with following the old ways but should also polish ourselves, stimulate progress, promote and magnify the results, seek truth, seek practicality, and make efforts on each position to create a culture of the times to cooperate with the great task of resistance and construction. Of course, saving the country is more urgent than putting out a fire. In times of crisis, a nation's greatest strength should be directly used in the war of resistance. However, making scholars go to the front lines and letting artists charge into battle will not be as effective as a strong man from the fields. The gains in the research room and the creation of literature and art should not be underestimated. One Marseillaise has inspired French soldiers to hate the enemy, and the invention of the tank enabled the Allied countries to achieve decisive victory in the European War. This miracle may well be seen again in today's China.

For three years, all Chinese cultural practitioners, whether in the front lines, the rear areas, or the occupied areas, have made great efforts to contribute their hard-working spiritual work to the times and the nation. However, strictly speaking, this is naturally not enough. In front-line communications, one can often see the calls for spiritual food from the soldiers. Groundbreaking great contributions are still lacking in various departments, whether in thought, literature, or science. Naturally, we must urgently expect all cultural figures to make further efforts. At the same time, we must pay attention to relieving the difficulties they face. Society has rarely given strong encouragement to culture, and literary people have rarely been able to enjoy a decent life. Since prices have soared and paper and ink have become extraordinarily expensive, it is the literati who feel the most threatened directly, and it is culture that suffers the most indirectly. Except for the central government once appropriating 100,000 yuan to replenish the literary and artistic fund, the general society has always shown little concern for this. Even if we take Shanghai as an example, although it has lost its position as a political, economic, and cultural center, it has not reduced its decisive influence. Moreover, among the various places in the front lines and rear areas, Shanghai has suffered the least damage and disruption, and has relatively convenient conditions for cultural work. However, here we only see hundreds of millions of speculative capital deceiving the public, and those who make money from national calamities are complacent, while all cultural undertakings and cultural personnel are trapped in unprecedented difficulties, unable to obtain adequate social support and assistance. Even if the current situation is such that we are too busy saving the dying, a problem concerning the root of the nation cannot be allowed to grow freely. Moreover, culture has always been deeply resented by the invaders, who are trying to destroy and exterminate it. On the other hand, culture is also the spiritual fortress of the country and nation, and the main foundation for revival and nation-building. Today, this issue should be considered first.

### Weekly War Situation: May 19th to 25th

Chongqing: The spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission stated that the most intense battles this week were still in the Henan and Hubei areas. Our troops continued to encourage the remaining men, and to fight the enemy who reinforced and counterattacked, we accomplished a counter-encirclement, killing thousands. The other Japanese troops active on the other lines were also heavily damaged. The important war achievements are listed as follows:

Henan and Hubei

The enemy who retreated from Zaoyang in northern Hubei ventured deep into our area after being reinforced on the 19th, and on the midnight of the 21st entered the periphery of our area of planned annihilation. Our troops reaching the towns of Xinyie and Luyie northeast of Fancheng saw that the counter-encirclement net had been formed, and began a full-scale attack on the noon of the 22nd. After day and night of bloody fighting, by the noon of the 13th, all of the enemy had been defeated by us and fled in all directions. The Japanese that we had surrounded in Zaoyang began to retreat south. Our troops are now stepping up efforts to annihilate the remaining Japanese troops. Also, on the morning of the 18th, our troops who had launched a fierce attack on Xinyang in southern Honan fought the Japanese and by 1:00 in the afternoon, the recapture of Xinyang was announced. In total, thousands of Japanese were killed inside and outside the city, 11 Japanese planes, more than a hundred tanks, and more than 200 vehicles were destroyed, and over ten large and small guns and over two thousand rifles and machine guns were seized, accomplishing an enormous victory in southern Honan and northern Hubei.

Southern Shanxi

More than 20,000 Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery troops advanced north toward Xiangning, and were met with a fierce attack by our troops in the areas of Nanbei, Wuqin, Mabi, Yuguan, and Guanyu. After fighting bloodily for the entire day and night, by 6:00 PM of the 18th, more than a thousand Japanese had been annihilated. The Japanese retreated south, and the recapture of Xiangning was announced. Since the 20th, the Chinese troops in southeastern Shanxi have launched a full-scale attack, and the various strongholds on the periphery of Jincheng and Yangcheng have been captured by us. On the 23rd, Nan Cun and Chen Cun in Shadian west of Jincheng were captured. Over ten Japanese tanks and more than a hundred armored vehicles were destroyed. The Japanese in Jincheng are now under our control. The battle for the suburbs of Yangcheng is also extremely fierce, with the high ground northwest of the city being contested more than seven times. It was finally captured by the Chinese troops on the 23rd.

Hunan

The Chinese troops in northern Hunan have launched large-scale attacks for days, annihilating many Japanese. On the 19th, they achieved victory in attacking Yanglousi. On the evening of the 20th, they attacked Wulipai east of Linxiang. After fierce fighting until the morning of the 21st, they penetrated the Japanese lines, killing many Japanese. On the 23rd, they attacked Taolin, fighting fiercely with the Japanese, killing over a thousand Japanese, seizing over 200 guns, and destroying 40 kilometers of railway and over 20 bridges. The Japanese in northern Jiangxi have gathered thousands of troops on the east bank of Poyang Lake since the 17th and invaded in two directions. One route landed at Pingzhi in Duchang, comprising over six thousand troops, invading Majianqiao, but were fiercely attacked by us. By 3:00 PM of the 23rd, the remaining Japanese were defeated and retreated north to Caijialing. We immediately recovered Majianqiao. The other route invaded from Pengze and was still in battle against us at Mamagiao on the 23rd. We have a great advantage.

Southern Guangdong

Regarding the Japanese at Wugongshan in Conghua, our troops launched a fierce attack on the morning of the 22nd. By 2:00 in the afternoon, we had captured the area, and joined forces with the friendly troops at Gaoshadi Ding to attack the enemy. At noon on the 20th, another elite unit completely eliminated the remaining enemy at Shiliuhuading and Piaotianfengding. They are now continuing to encircle and annihilate the Japanese at Shichuangbei. In summary, the recent battles have resulted in the annihilation of over three thousand Japanese officers and soldiers and the seizure of countless military supplies.

Southwestern Shandong

The Japanese army of nine thousand soldiers from Jinan have invaded Chengwu and Caoxian, gathering over four thousand people. Attached to them were ten cannons, over twenty vehicles, and many tanks were fiercely attacked by us. After a day of intense fighting, we killed over two thousand Japanese, and the remaining Japanese are based in the areas of Houji and Yangzhuzhai.

Chinese Air Force

On the morning of the 20th, seven Japanese planes were shot down in the skies over Liangshan. On the 15th, our troops near Wushengguan shot down a Japanese heavy bomber. On the 22nd, our troops in eastern Jiangxi shot down a Japanese plane in the southeast of Hukou. On the same day, our troops in southern Chahar shot down a Japanese plane northeast of Yuxian. These were all significant gains. (26th dispatch)

### Chinese Troops Attack Huang'an City

Lingshan, 19th evening, Chinese troops stormed Kexi Mountain, about three miles north of Huang'an, killing countless Japanese soldiers. The Japanese in Huang'an, upon hearing the news, rushed to reinforce, but were intercepted by the Chinese in the mountainous area south of the suburbs. After three hours of fierce fighting, over two hundred Japanese soldiers were killed. The remaining Japanese troops retreated in defeat. The Chinese are now pressing their attack on Huang'an County.

### Disputes Expected in the Legation Quarter in Beiping

Beiping, as the number of European countries involved in the war increases, disputes are expected to arise in the Legation Quarter in Dongjiaomin Lane. This is because Dongjiaomin Lane is a special zone managed by an international organization composed of a number of embassy staff from various countries. Following the fall of the Netherlands and Belgium, the Dutch legation has notified the Germans in some Dutch properties in Dongjiaomin Lane to move out. However, the German school and the German Association are now moving people into the former Austrian legation, which was seized when Germany annexed Austria, and are expelling all Dutch residents as retaliation. However, the Germans have not yet taken over the Dutch and Belgian embassies, and it is questionable whether the Japanese will allow this to happen. It should be noted that there are no Norwegian or Danish embassies in Beiping. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Tianjin, a dispute occurred last night at the entrance to the blockade line of the Tianjin Concession. A car from the Italian consulate, driven by a Chinese chauffeur, was wearing an Italian police uniform. When he passed a Japanese sentry post, he did not stop for inspection, so the Japanese sentry stepped forward to stop him and slapped him. The chauffeur refused to endure this and fought back. The Japanese authorities considered the situation serious and immediately arrested the chauffeur. At that time, the newly appointed Italian Consul in Tianjin, Brighi, was passing by in another car. He immediately got out of the car and went to the Japanese barracks with the Japanese soldiers and the chauffeur to demand the release of the chauffeur. Negotiations lasted for several hours.

### Mechanization of Soviet Coal Mining. Output Ranks First in the World

TASS Special Article, in the two five-year plans, Soviet coal mines have become the most mechanized industry. In terms of coal mining mechanization, the Soviet Union ranks first in the world. At the beginning of the first five-year plan, the Soviet Union stopped buying coal mining machinery from abroad. 84% of the work of dragging to the ground has been mechanized, and coal transportation is also handled by special electric vehicles. In 1939, a total of 1,258 electric vehicles were used in Dunazhi and Gusnazhik. Due to the success of mechanization, Soviet coal production has greatly increased, reaching 132,900,000 tons in 1938, which is four and a half times more than in 1913. The third five-year plan stipulates that coal production in 1942 will be 243,000,000 tons, and all excavation work will be carried out with new methods and new machinery.

### Allied Forces Launch Counter-Offensive. War Situation Gradually Becoming Favorable. German Troops Fail to Attack New Allied Positions in the North. French Troops Recapture Several Strongholds Along the Somme River

Paris, the General Headquarters issued a war report stating that the enemy forces in the north of our country have repeatedly attacked our army's positions, but have not succeeded. Our army has launched an offensive in certain areas along the Somme River and has been quite successful, having already captured several new strongholds. The artillery forces of both sides are quite active between the Aisne and Meuse rivers. In addition, the enemy forces have repeatedly attacked fiercely along the line of Montmédy and Arras, but have been repelled by our army. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Paris, responsible military officials here recently released the following news on the war situation on the front line: (1) In the Courtrai area of southern Belgium, German troops have repeatedly launched fierce attacks without success, and were subsequently repelled by the counter-offensive of French and Belgian troops. (2) The war situation is calm along the line of Valenciennes, Cambrai, and Arras in northern France. German tank units and mechanized units have been reinforced northwest of Arras, but there is not much activity. (3) On the English Channel side, the German army is still quite far south of the port of Calais, and the fighting is extremely fierce. The enemy has suffered heavy losses, especially the air force. As for the port of Boulogne, as of noon today, it is still in the hands of the French army. (4) East of Amiens, the French army is conducting mopping-up operations along the Somme River valley and has recovered several strongholds along the river. (5) On the eastern front, the French artillery fiercely bombarded German positions in the Upper Argonne area, inflicting heavy damage. (6) In the Houthulst area, the German army's attempt to forcibly cross the Scheldt River failed. (7) There is nothing worth mentioning between the Aisne and Meuse rivers and between the Lys and Somme rivers. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Paris, a French military spokesman claimed last night that Boulogne was still in the hands of the Allied forces before dusk yesterday, and Calais was being firmly defended by the French army. The spokesman summarized the war situation as follows:

German troops in the north attacked the new positions of the British and French forces, and the Belgian army has launched a counter-offensive. The fighting in the areas of Valenciennes, Cambrai, and Arras is becoming more intense. German armored vehicles and mechanized units are advancing west of the "gap" in the province of Pas-de-Calais and have occupied several ridges northwest of Arras. The fighting in the Saint-Omer area is continuing. German troops are currently attacking Boulogne, but have not been able to occupy the city as of yesterday evening. The French army continues to have local battles along the Somme River and has been quite successful. In summary, there is no need to be pessimistic. In fact, we can feel a certain confidence. However, it must be stated that the Allied forces in the north have not been surrounded and maintain all traffic in the area and receive sufficient military supplies. All the claims made by the German side are inaccurate. The German armored vehicle units that have broken into the pocket area between Arras and Amiens are attacking the west side of the Allied forces concentrated in the north and have been blocked at Saint-Omer and can only reach several ridges northwest of Arras. The most famous of these is Vimy Ridge. The German troops fighting in the "gap" in Pas-de-Calais are currently only mobile units, armored vehicles, and mechanized infantry. The infantry division has not invaded this "gap." (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

German War Report

Hitler's Headquarters, the German High Command issued a war report today stating that our army continues to advance towards the provinces of Flanders and Artois, reducing the area of activity of the enemy army within the encirclement line. However, the enemy army is still trying to resist stubbornly. In order to quickly destroy the enemy army's resistance, our army sent aircraft to assist in the battle and bombed its combat strongholds. The coastal ports of Belgium and France, such as Ostend and Dunkirk, were all bombed by our aircraft. The ammunition depot in Ostend caught fire after being hit, and a transport ship was also destroyed. On the night of the 24th, our air force bombed the east coast and southeast coast of England and achieved considerable results. Two small freighters and one warship were destroyed near Calais. Two other merchant ships (each of 5,000 tons) were also destroyed by bombs. Yesterday, the enemy lost 59 aircraft, and 11 of our air force aircraft were missing. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)

Over a thousand prisoners were sent to the rear, and the German army discovered a French regimental commander in a certain place who committed suicide because of the defeat. The German army praised his loyalty and buried him. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)

Germany Claims New Weapons Will Be Used to Attack England. Three Belgian Coastal Cities Bombed to the Ground

Berlin, German sources here claimed yesterday that the annihilation of the British, French, Belgian, and Dutch troops trapped in southern Belgium and northern France is beyond doubt. Authoritative sources recently indicated that Germany will use a top-secret weapon in future operations against England, "It is predicted that there will be amazing miracles." They said that the contents of this secret weapon could not be disclosed at the moment, "But England will soon see the results." German bombers launched a large-scale attack on the English Channel ports of Ostend, Dunkirk, and Bruges yesterday. German military sources said that these cities have been bombed into "ruins." Therefore, the retreat of approximately 500,000 troops from the French 1st, 7th, and 9th armies, the remnants of the Belgian army, and the British expeditionary force is now hopeless, and the rear transportation of these troops has also been completely blocked. It is reported that Calais was surrounded by German troops yesterday and is about to fall. The current advance of the German army has occupied two-thirds of the land in Flanders and Picardy held by the Allied forces. The German army is attempting to break through the Vimy Ridge of Gravelines, cross the north, and cut off the Allied troops to the English Channel. The German Air Force continues to bomb troop concentration points and anti-aircraft gun positions on the French and Belgian coasts. Oil tanks, shipyards, docks, and artillery positions were also bombed at the same time. One destroyer and seven merchant transport ships totaling 10,000 tons have reportedly been destroyed. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

French Coastal Villages Enveloped in Flames. Mr. Walter Directs Destruction Work

Paris, according to military sources received here last night, the Allied forces yesterday prevented the German army from advancing from Boulogne and Calais. The Allied forces in the center advanced northward, heading straight for the German corridor to the English Channel, almost able to see the besieged Allied forces in the north. Military sources predict that the northern gap will soon be closed, isolating the German army in the Channel. The German army's lifeline to the ports of the Channel, 12 miles wide, was heavily bombarded by Allied artillery fire last night, making it impossible for the German army to use the corridor to retreat its threatened tank divisions or send reinforcements. Behind the French army's positions, a German army corps under the command of General Walter, a friend of Hitler and a senior member of the Reichstag, is active. Some of the mechanized units of this army have been cut off from the rear supply station, and some have been captured or destroyed. The German tanks and motorized units active around Saint-Omer and behind Calais and Boulogne turned north last night, and it is believed that they are trying to return to the "pocket" on the Belgian front. Yesterday's fighting in northern France actually involved two different operational situations. One was General Weygand's attempt to connect with the northern army and concentrate it on the plains of Flanders. The second was the army of General Walter harassing the French countryside, burning villages, destroying fields, factories, mines, roads, railways, and bridges, so that the Allied forces could not maintain their lines of communication. Motorized units with machine guns, armored cars, and tanks have roamed the coastal villages between Dieppe and Boulogne. These villages have become scorched earth after being passed by General Walter's troops, desolate and desolate. Thousands of farmhouses have been burned down, and countless villages are completely enveloped in flames. The dark night sky is also dyed red by the fire, and the fire is spreading very widely and can be seen from the coast of England. Millions of civilians are fleeing in panic when the German army approaches, as if they were the vanguard of the German army. In the coastal areas where German motorized units were discovered, all small boats were sunk by artillery fire. The entire coastal area has been razed to the ground by German bombers, tanks, and infantry riding in armored vehicles. Although the German bombers systematically destroyed the coastal areas with their incendiary bombs, they did not destroy the important docks, warehouses, and other large coastal ports of Boulogne and Calais. This is truly unusual. The commander of this army responsible for the destruction work is one of the famous figures in the German General Staff. He was one of the initiators of Hitler's National Socialism. Before Hitler came to power, Walter had been colluding with him for a long time. After the Nazi Party gained power, Walter was favored, and the other members of the General Staff, who were all jealous of him, called him "the Nazi general." However, Walter finally entered the General Staff and became a soldier. According to military sources here, after the German command learned that General Walter's army was surrounded by the Allied forces and was in danger, it repeatedly tried to break through the Allied encirclement. However, despite fierce attacks on the lines of the British, French, and Belgian armies, the German army made no progress except at Ghent. In Ghent, the left wing of the Allied forces has gradually retreated towards the Lys River line of Zulte. The German army also claimed to have occupied Doornik, but this news has been denied by the Belgian army. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

### German Operations on the Western Front: New Weapons Emerge Endlessly; Utilizing "Sound Terror" Methods Shows No Surprising Effect

Paris: A French military communique stated that the German side has recently employed "sound terror" methods, including "sharp-sounding aircraft" that generate ear-splitting noise like numerous air raid sirens when diving. Another is "screaming bombs" equipped with cardboard containing drilled holes, which emit piercing shrieking sounds as they fall. The Allied forces are now completely accustomed to these methods, and even if they once had any surprising effect, it has now completely failed. (Reuters, 26th)

### British Bomber Squadrons on the Front Lines Assisting Allied Forces in Operations: Destroying Transportation, Bombing German Tank Columns

London: Yesterday, the Ministry of Aviation announced that on the previous evening, British bombers conducted raids in northeastern France, southern Belgium, and German territory. As a result, they destroyed transport vehicles, troop concentrations, road and railway intersections, bridges, and trains. In several locations, enemy transportation lines have been thrown into chaos, with fires breaking out in multiple places, causing significant damage. Three British aircraft did not return. Today, British bomber squadrons are continuously assisting British, French, and Belgian forces in operations on various front lines. British fighter squadrons are still patrolling the airspace over various war zones and the French and Belgian coasts. According to this morning's report, twelve enemy aircraft have been shot down or severely damaged, while the British side only lost one Hurricane fighter. On Friday, a squadron of British Blenheim bombers discovered German mechanized units along coastal roads near Boulogne and immediately subjected them to intense bombing. Although some British aircraft were hit by enemy anti-aircraft fire, there were no casualties among the crew. In the evening, a large squadron of British bombers, under heavy anti-aircraft fire, destroyed a crucial canal bridge, dropping no fewer than three hundred bombs. All British aircraft returned safely, with only one pilot suffering minor injuries. Furthermore, forty German motorcycles were attacked by British Blenheim bombers, sustaining multiple hits. On Friday evening, enemy anti-aircraft positions not far from the coast were subjected to intense British air attacks, and several German armored vehicles were destroyed. (Reuters, 26th)

### National Churches in England Pray for Victory

The King in Military Attire; Even with Protective Gear, He Personally Attends the Cathedral

London: King George VI designated today as a day of prayer for the British Empire and its Allied nations. Consequently, the entire country responded. Churches in major cities and small villages, as well as households, all engaged in sincere prayer. The King and Queen of the Netherlands both attended the service at Westminster Abbey, along with the Prime Minister and many cabinet members. Churches and all synagogues across the country also opened their doors for this special prayer service. When Bishop Hensley Henson was delivering his radio broadcast sermon at Westminster Abbey, a woman shouted "Peace!" The broadcast was briefly interrupted, and the woman was escorted out of the church. The Bishop continued his sermon, seemingly unaffected by the interruption. The Archbishop of Canterbury also preached at Westminster Abbey, describing the fierce and brutal advance of demonic forces. He continued, saying that a spirit of quiet confidence can break through the darkness. In this abbey, which is also a shrine to the nation's history, surrounded by memorials to heroes who faced and overcame other dangers, mere panic and unmoving worry are unacceptable. From ancient times, the German rulers have prepared for years to carry out their evil schemes with impressive, powerful machines. However, the strength of humans always surpasses that of any machine, and the spirit of free people will prove stronger than those who use machines. This can only slow down the machines. The King, wearing the uniform of the Royal Air Force, had a gas mask slung over his shoulder. The Queen also had a gas mask hanging from her shoulder. The King and Queen sat with the Queen of the Netherlands in a special pew south of the altar. The abbey was packed, with many people who arrived late standing outside. As the King, Queen, Prime Minister Churchill, and other cabinet members left the abbey, the crowd outside cheered. According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, only one woman disrupted Bishop Henson's radio broadcast sermon, which was due to the overwhelming emotion induced by the religious ceremony. The Archbishop of Canterbury later broadcast his entire speech during a family prayer service. (Reuters, 26th)

They will undoubtedly persevere to the end. When the German army attacked on the tenth of this month, our country had a total of 700,000 soldiers. As of now, a large number of young men are undergoing training in southern France. Once completed, the total strength will reach over a million. (Havas, 26th)

The newspapers largely predict that the British and French empires are about to cease to exist. (Havas, 26th)

Rome: Rumors that Italy will join Germany in the war have become more widespread yesterday, based on the development of four situations. First, the Vatican Secretary of State sent letters to consulates and embassies, inquiring whether they would seek refuge in Vatican City should war break out between their countries and Italy. Second, all Italian ocean liners to the Atlantic have been postponed until June 10th, and it is announced that there will be no further schedules to the Far East and the Near East published.

Rome: The semi-official "International Relations Magazine" published an article today openly advocating for national participation in the war, stating, "Germany's goals are nearly achieved, and so are Italy's. The shackles on the Italian nation in the Mediterranean Sea must be removed, thereby achieving maritime freedom. Regarding this, since Britain and France insist on opposing and refusing to change, the Italian nation cannot realize its legitimate aspirations without the use of force. In short, the decisive moment has arrived. In today's world, cowards or those 'obsessed with moral precepts' have no place to stand. Therefore, the Italian nation is currently awaiting Prime Minister Mussolini's orders, preparing to pave a new path for the security and development of the empire." (Havas, 25th)

### Italy Reaffirms Guarantee Not to Invade the Balkans; Yugoslavia Adopts Security Measures; US Hopes Hungary Will Maintain Peace

Capital of Yugoslavia: It is heard that Italy has renewed its guarantees to the governments of the Balkan countries, stating that it does not plan to take any action in the Balkans. The semi-official Vreme newspaper carries a dispatch from Rome, saying that according to reliable sources, the Italian government has instructed its envoys to the Balkan countries to inform the governments where they are stationed that rumors of Italy having military plans in the Balkans are completely unfounded, and that Italy has firmly decided to make every effort to prevent the war from spreading to the Balkans and to continue to maintain relations with all countries on the basis of existing treaties. According to well-informed sources in Yugoslavia, the above news is quite accurate in general sense and confirms the documents received by the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Allied observers here are now comparing the recent firm attitude taken by the Soviet Union with this guarantee from Italy. The recent attitude of the Soviet Union can be reflected in the remarks of Moscow leaders, that the current situation in Southeastern Europe must not be changed. (Reuters, 26th)

Capital of Yugoslavia: According to information received here, Italy has concentrated 150,000 troops in Albania in the past few days. Also, the port of Zara on the Adriatic coast, which is Italy's base within Yugoslav territory, has concentrated 5,000 troops. The people along the coast of Dalmatia Province are extremely anxious upon learning of this. Observers here are deeply concerned that Italy may attack southern Serbia Province, thereby cutting off Yugoslavia's communication with Greece and Yugoslavia's communication with the Mediterranean. Due to these reasons, the Yugoslav military authorities have taken necessary steps to ensure security. On the Italian side, it is said that these measures are only precautionary in nature, in order to protect Italian interests in case Britain and France take any action in Yugoslavia or the Thessaloniki Province of Greece. (Havas, 26th)

Furthermore, the ambassadors of both countries have been summoned back to their respective countries and have not yet returned to their posts. They are about to return to their posts separately, because Italy urgently wants to stabilize relations with the Soviet Union before going to war against Britain and France, and wants that country to take responsibility for maintaining peace in the Balkan Peninsula, so it is trying to get closer. German officials have neither confirmed nor denied the above rumors, saying only that Germany helped broker relations between Italy and the Soviet Union some time ago. (Havas, 26th)

### Review of the Second Week of Fighting on the Western Front: Allied Strategy Fails, Germans Claim to Have Gained the Upper Hand

Berlin: General Steel Fried, a military correspondent for Reuters, recently described the second week of fighting on the Western Front, stating that from May 18th to 24th, the German army created a decisive situation in the war. The area where we broke through the Maginot Line is over 100 kilometers long. Armored divisions have advanced from Amiens to the coast of the English Channel, encircling the enemy in Flanders Province from the north. The British, French, and Belgian troops currently surrounded have no chance of self-rescue. The initial operational goal of the German army was to break through the southern defenses of Namur and strike directly at the English Channel via Amiens. The constant movement of the main force of armored divisions and motorized units to that location, coupled with large reinforcements being sent to supplement that direction, is a fact. Because our army must supplement its advance to the west step by step, our southern wing is extended and its strength is empty, it will inevitably be attacked by the French army. However, at that time, the French army's strength south of the Sambre River was extremely weak. The French army, perhaps at the request of the British army, was unable to firmly refuse and concentrated its main force in the area from Valenciennes to Namur, directly protecting the coasts of the Netherlands and Belgium. The British and French commanders made this great mistake, apparently failing to properly estimate the power of the German offensive and the speed of its progress. General Gamelin thus believed that he could calmly organize countermeasures. As a result, the German armored divisions and motorized divisions advanced step by step, as easily as splitting bamboo. Saint-Quentin and Arras were occupied on May 18th, and on the 20th they advanced to Amiens and Abbeville. At this point, the communication between Flanders Province and the enemy forces within France was cut off, completing the encirclement. If German reinforcements could have quickly arrived at that time to secure the occupied positions, the fate of the British, French, and Belgian troops there could have been decided earlier. However, at that time, the French army did not immediately launch a counterattack from the south. The German army was able to consolidate its advances. Thus, General Gamelin's plan became impossible to implement. In addition, the German air force engaged in destroying railway lines, preventing French reinforcements from reaching the north. Therefore, the German army was able to maintain its positions along the Somme River and also advance to the north. Saint-Pol and Étaples fell successively. On May 22nd, the German army continued to advance towards Calais and Saint-Omer. On May 24th, after advancing to the Saint-Pol defense line between Saint-Omer and Aire, it besieged Calais and occupied Boulogne. At this point, France recalled General Weygand, commander-in-chief of the Allied forces in the Near East, to replace General Gamelin. However, after General Weygand took office, the shocking news occurred that General Giraud, commander of the French Ninth Army, was captured. This may be because General Weygand's reputation led the French army and British armored units to attempt to break through the heavy German encirclement. Fierce battles occurred in the areas of Maubeuge, Valenciennes, Saint-Pol, Arras, and Cambrai on the 20th, but the British and French forces failed to break through. Until May 24th, the German army advanced from the southeast in two directions, and the fighting in that area finally ended. On May 19th, the northern flank of the British and French Allied forces had retreated to the defense line east of Ghent, along the Scheldt River to the Franco-Belgian border. However, the German army broke through this defense line near Tournai (east of Lille) on the 23rd and immediately occupied the city of Ghent and the city of Courtrai. This was the initial situation of the breakthrough south of Ghent across the Lys River on the 24th. In addition, the German front line has advanced north along the Somme River towards Montmédy. The forts in the Maginot Line there have been attacked, but the German commander does not appear to be launching an attack there. The final decisive battle may occur first in Flanders Province.

### Sweden Issues National Defense Bonds; New Swedish Pursuit Aircraft First Appear in the Sky

Capital of Sweden: A rally was held in Skansen, Sweden, last night to solicit five hundred million Swedish kronor for national defense bonds. Crown Prince Gustaf of Sweden and Swedish Defense Minister Sköld delivered speeches in succession. The Crown Prince said briefly, "Sweden is fortunate to be outside the war. We have no grievances against the people of any country, but in order to maintain the country's freedom and independence, we will spare no sacrifice." The Defense Minister said in his speech, "Sweden is a small country with limited capacity, so it must maintain its consistent policies of the past." During the rally yesterday, the new Swedish pursuit aircraft appeared in the sky for the first time. Out of the five hundred million bonds, two hundred and ten million kronor were raised on yesterday alone. (Reuter, 26th)

### French Air Force Commander-in-Chief Encourages Troops to Maintain Historical Glory

Paris: General Vuillemin, commander-in-chief of the French Air Force, issued an order encouraging the entire army, saying, "Since the outbreak of the war, you have strived day and night in the two weeks of major battles to resist the numerically superior enemy and have achieved victory. I know I can rely on you. The time for decisive battle has come today. We must ensure that our skies still belong to France. Our planes and the planes of our allies will fly wing to wing in the sky filled with glory, fly in the sky of Guynemer (the most famous French aviator in the last war). Following the example of our predecessors, win new victories to commemorate your merits." (Reuters, 26th)

### British Youth Eagerly Register for Service; Since the Implementation of Conscription, More Than Two Million People Have Enlisted

London: According to official announcement, on Friday, those who registered under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act included 326,000 men born in 1912 and those who turned 20 on April 28th. This is the largest number of people registered in a single day. The number of people who provisionally registered as conscientious objectors was 3,400 (0.105 percent). This is the lowest percentage since the start of conscription. By the end of April, 1.85 million people had been conscripted. Including the number registered on Friday, more than two million people have enlisted. (Reuters, 26th)

London: The British War Office announced last night that it has decided to add several squadrons to some battalions of the Home Guard, to perform special tasks in the UK. Their age is limited to 18 to 19 and a half years. They are to be transferred to battle-trained army units when they reach the age of 20. Those who are engaged in manufacturing munitions, ships, and producing military supplies should continue their work. (Reuters, 26th)

### British Munitions Factories Accelerate Work

London: The "National Service Column" promoted by Ernest Bevin, Minister of Labor and National Service, has begun its large-scale movement today as munitions factories are accelerating work. Transport authorities are also participating in the cooperation to enable thousands of workers, who are accustomed to sleeping in a little longer on Sundays, to go out to work as usual. They all got up early, the same as on working days, and went to the factories by train and bus. The sound of the machines turning and the clang of hammers were mixed with the sound of church bells. (Reuters, 26th)

### Reorganization of Bulgarian Army

Sofia: Bulgarian Minister of National Defense Daskalov yesterday submitted a broad military bill to parliament, stipulating the complete reorganization of the Bulgarian army, setting the conscription age from 17 to 65, and establishing military schools to train officers. (Reuter, 26th)

### Province Establishment: Wartime Special Goods Public Sales Office to Regulate Sales and Ensure Supply and Demand Balance; Trial Implementation of Several Items, to be Expanded in the Future

Nancheng Correspondence: Jiangxi, located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, has always relied on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the Nanxun Railway, which connects to the Yangtze River, as its main transportation routes. After the fall of Hangzhou and the demolition of the eastern section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the Nanxun line in northern Jiangxi also suffered the same fate. As a result, transportation in Jiangxi Province became extremely difficult, and the supply and demand of various goods could not be balanced. Major exports such as rice, porcelain, tea, paper, and bamboo and wood were difficult to regulate, and essential imported goods such as cotton yarn, cloth, kerosene, , hardware, pigments, and Western medicine were also difficult to obtain. Even when small quantities were imported, they were controlled by capitalists and war profiteers. Prices soared like a kite with a cut string. In order to stabilize foreign exchange and regulate prices, the provincial government, in addition to the monopoly of tungsten sand and other items by the Resources Commission, also established a wartime trade department. Its main business included: (A) Exports: (1) pig bristles; (2) leather and other items that could earn foreign exchange; (3) rice, paper, sugar, and other items urgently needed by neighboring provinces. Items (1) and (2) were prohibited from free trade by the public. (B) Imports: mainly cigarettes, hardware, cotton yarn, Western medicine, electrical materials, etc., which were distributed to merchants after import. However, the strength of the trade department was limited, and merchants took advantage of the situation, manipulating most of the goods, causing prices to rise sharply, of course, varying from morning to night. Currently, taking Ji'an as the standard, ordinary cotton yarn is priced at 2,300 to 2,400 yuan per bale, raw cotton is 210 yuan per 100 jin, blue cloth is 1 yuan per foot, and quinine pills are 15 cents each. Other prices can be imagined. To further control the market, the trade department has established a wartime goods public sales office, with a general office in Ji'an and branch offices in Ganzhou, Nancheng, Jingdezhen, Linchuan, and Shangrao. For the time being, cigarettes, matches, liquid fuels (gasoline, diesel, kerosene), hardware, and pigments are designated as items for public sale. All of the above items must be purchased and sold publicly by the office, and private sales by the public are prohibited. If the trial run yields good results, it will be expanded to include other items.

### Jinghu and Huhu-Hangzhou Railways Repeatedly Damaged; Japanese Side Uses Inducements to Protect Farmers

Suzhou Correspondence: The Jinghu and Huhu-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have been occupied and opened to traffic by the Japanese for more than two years. However, Chinese troops constantly damaged them, causing the Japanese side to suffer losses. Recently, the Japanese side used various methods to induce farmers along the two railways to protect the railways. Within two kilometers on both sides of the railway, Baojia (local security system) was established, and after completion, it would be extended to within five kilometers, to be completed within August. Farmers were responsible for reporting the whereabouts of Chinese troops and were subject to joint liability. If the railway was damaged, they had to report it beforehand and assist in the repair afterwards, and were not allowed to escape. All trees in the villages had to be cut down, and high ridges and hills had to be leveled. If this was implemented, villagers along the railway would be allowed to ride the train for free, and free medical treatment would be available at each station, with mobile medical vehicles and mobile low-priced sales vehicles. Priority would be given to the transportation of goods, and free agricultural seeds and vegetable seedlings would be distributed. However, the farmers, deeply aware of righteousness, ignored these inducements.

### Japanese and Puppet Troops Building Road in Gaoyou Lake; Landmines Kill Dozens

Xinghua Correspondence: On the 17th of this month, two Japanese shallow-water submarines and six speedboats, carrying over 300 Japanese and puppet soldiers and hundreds of civilian laborers, landed near Chexiemba in Gaoyou Lake to build a road. Chinese troops had previously laid landmines in the area. After the Japanese and puppet soldiers landed, they triggered the landmines, killing seventy or eighty Japanese soldiers and over a hundred puppet pacification troops. While the Japanese and puppet soldiers were in panic and chaos, Chinese troops launched a fierce attack, inflicting over a hundred more casualties despite the stubborn resistance of the Japanese and puppet forces. After a fierce battle lasting six hours, the Japanese and puppet forces were defeated and fled.

### Treatment of Spermatorrhea in Men and Menstrual Disorders in Women

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

Our doctors, when studying the causes of spermatorrhea, can divide them into two major reasons: one is purely due to congenital weakness, and the other is entirely due to acquired injuries. Congenital weakness is caused by abnormal maternal health, while acquired injuries are caused by masturbation, indulgence, and overwork. Those with the above-mentioned faults will inevitably suffer from spermatorrhea, and masturbation only leads to unnatural daydreams, forced fantasies , so it is very easy to weaken attention and reasoning power, and spermatorrhea is unavoidable. Just imagine that if semen is discharged incessantly by masturbation, plus the threat of spermatorrhea, the semen produced by the human body will inevitably be exhausted. After spermatorrhea, there is a sign of weakness. If spermatorrhea is not treated early, neurasthenia will follow, and at the same time, troublesome diseases such as premature ejaculation, impotence, and incomplete development are inevitable.

When treating spermatorrhea, avoid using harsh medicines. In addition to clearing the mind and reducing desires, take the German testicular essence preparation for men, "Bu Ti Kang," to nourish deficiencies, increase sperm, and replenish blood, so that both congenital weakness and acquired injuries can be turned from weak to strong. Then, take three tablets of "Nai Er Shi Spermatorrhea Tablets" before going to bed every night, and spermatorrhea can be completely cured. The two medicines taken together have miraculous effects.

As for the menstrual disorders commonly suffered by women, they are also related to health. Such as irregular menstruation, abdominal pain during menstruation, excessive or insufficient menstrual flow, etc., are all pathological conditions. Those with this kind of disease, first, hinder fertility, and infertility is unavoidable; second, physical and mental discomfort. Such women often shorten their lifespan. The method of treatment lies in adjusting menstruation. Taking female "Bu Ti Kang" can achieve the effect of regulating menstruation and promoting development, relieving anemia and kidney deficiency. The ingredients of female "Bu Ti Kang" are entirely derived from ovarian secretions, and it also contains brain-boosting, blood-replenishing, and kidney-tonifying minerals, so its efficacy is accurate and it is praised as a masterpiece in gynecology.

### Cured Case of Masturbation and Spermatorrhea

— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

Patient Zhang Yunming, 23 years old, works as a clerk in a printing house. (Self-reported) — He mistakenly committed masturbation during development. At first, he was seduced by bad friends, and later it became a natural habit. He masturbated once every night, and even in the morning he had to masturbate for temporary pleasure, resulting in a sallow complexion, neurasthenia, spermatorrhea, and nocturnal emission, all gathered in one body. He was weak in doing things, and his development was also hindered. Sometimes, although he stopped masturbating, he would inevitably experience spermatorrhea during sleep, and he would be drowsy in the morning and uncomfortable all day long. His body became more and more depleted, and he begged for treatment. (Treatment process) First, he was instructed to take the German strong animal testicular essence preparation for men, "Bu Ti Kang," three times a day to nourish deficiencies, and then electrotherapy was performed to strengthen the sperm barrier. Three tablets of "Nai Er Shi Spermatorrhea Tablets" were also given before going to bed to stop spermatorrhea. With such three-pronged treatment, in less than three months, all the symptoms suffered by Zhang Yunming were completely cured, and his weight also increased by five or six pounds.

### Special Attention Should Be Paid to Acute Gonorrhea

— Dr. Wang Kechun, German Medical Doctor

Acute gonorrhea can be divided into the following stages: incubation period, mucous period or prodromal period, purulent discharge period or peak period, and remission period. The gonococci in the incubation period are latent in the navicular fossa of the urethra and other places, carrying out division and proliferation. The place is inflamed due to the stimulation of gonococci and toxins. The gonococci working in this latent urethral part have no phenomenon, and when its inflammation occurs outside, it is a sign of the onset of the disease. As this inflammation gradually becomes serious, a kind of mucus is secreted. At this time, if examined under a microscope, it can be seen that in addition to epithelial cells, there are also multinucleated white blood cells and many gonococci mixed in. After that, it enters the peak period, and this symptom is generally seen in two or three days. The outflow fluid changes from a milky mucus-purulent liquid to a gradually thick yellow pus. By the second week, it becomes a green pus with a small amount of blood. The inflammation burns like fire, and the glans and foreskin are swollen, urination is not smooth, and the pain is very severe. After another week or so, the secretion gradually decreases, the pain gradually eases, and it enters the remission period. However, if it is still not cured at this time, it will inevitably turn into a chronic disease, and various complications will occur. Therefore, attention must be paid to its treatment at this time. I have been engaged in the treatment of gonorrhea for many years, and I use "Ke Lin Nong," a medicine invented by German Dr. Peter, as an oral agent, which can immediately kill gonococci and prevent them from invading the deep parts of the body. On the other hand, using "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally to wash the urine according to the method is even more wonderful. As for female gonorrhea leukorrhea, "Ka Er Xue Di Vaginal Tablets" can be used externally as suppositories, and taking "Ke Lin Nong" internally also has the same effect. Using these special medicines for treatment, the efficacy can be expected soon.

### Gonorrhea Lecture

— Narrated by Dr. Yao Ju

Clinic: Ningbo Road, No. 9, at the intersection of Sichuan Road

Why Are Gonococci Active in Summer?

Seasons and Bacteria

There is a great relationship between the seasons and the survival of bacteria, so many seasonal diseases are quite prevalent in a certain season, but they are rarely seen in a certain season. This is because the effectiveness of climate activity is inextricably linked. Now, let’s talk about the activity of gonococci. The transmission of gonorrhea is not limited to climate and seasons, but it cannot be said that the activity of gonococci has nothing to do with the climate. When spring goes and summer comes, all things are thriving, and we also move more actively than in other seasons due to the heat of summer. Therefore, the long-dormant gonococci inevitably take the opportunity to move out and act wantonly, so there are cases where chronic gonorrhea that has not been cured often recurs in summer, and the reason lies in this. There is another reason that is also an element of gonorrhea's licentiousness, that is, we need more sexual desire in summer than in other seasons. Therefore, it is also the main reason for the spread of gonorrhea.

Easy Curing Opportunity

However, we should turn back and say that this season, when gonococci are most active, is also the season when gonorrhea is easiest to cure. Because at this time, gonococci have been dormant for a long time and are thinking about moving, and they have the potential to come and attack with all their strength. Therefore, taking advantage of their full activity to eradicate them all at once is really a one-shot-kill thing. According to my experience, only "New Ke Lin Nong" (available at Wing On Company), the holy medicine for gonorrhea, is the best. Because the bactericidal effect of "New Ke Lin Nong" is meticulous. It is even better to use German electrostatic therapy and X-ray electrotherapy alternately. As a result, the latent gonococci are quickly eliminated, so the new summer season is actually the best opportunity to eradicate gonorrhea, and don't miss this good opportunity.

### Hemoptysis Should Be Cured Quickly

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Regarding hemoptysis caused by tuberculosis, the blood vessels in the diseased part are fragile, and due to movement and coughing, the blood vessels rupture and cause hemoptysis symptoms. Tuberculosis is a chronic disease, and the process of all disease changes is extremely slow. However, hemoptysis is a sudden event, so effective measures must be taken and absolutely no negligence is allowed. However, in terms of theory and experience, hemoptysis is not an absolutely critical disease. But it cannot be regarded as a minor symptom. According to my many years of experience, "Bu Nao Er" is the most effective in terms of oral medicine. It can not only cure hemoptysis, but also cure the root cause of hemoptysis. I am not afraid of pulmonary tuberculosis and hemoptysis, and the reason lies in this. Moreover, "Bu Nao Er" has the miraculous effect of killing pulmonary tuberculosis bacteria, so it is the most effective internal medicine for pulmonary tuberculosis and hemoptysis.

### Various Belligerent Countries Such as England, France, and Germany Are Conducting Propaganda Offensives in Shanghai; Publishing Various Publications to Expand Propaganda; American Magazine Says Italy Will Not Participate in the War

The recently published Millard's Review once carried an article recording the unusually active situation of the German "Fifth Column" in Shanghai. This kind of psychological warfare waged by belligerent countries in Shanghai is indeed worthy of attention. According to reporter investigations, in order to counteract it, the British and French sides also often issue pamphlets in Chinese and Japanese, distributing them to all parties, and using radio broadcasts to expand propaganda. The determination of their will cannot be overwhelmed by the temporary military victories of the German side. And the activities of the German "Fifth Column" are becoming more and more active. In addition to the lone struggle of the Huitong News Agency, it is heard that it is trying its best to make the English publications issued in this port attack England and France. The German newspaper issues an English extra once every afternoon, originally one page, but now it has been expanded to four pages. In addition, the German consulate stipulates that it will entertain Chinese and foreign reporters once a week to explain Germany's position. The German school on Da Xi Road shows a film once a week. The German side has recently issued a Chinese version of the Far East Pictorial, using pictures for propaganda. It can be said that Germany and England and France have already engaged in short-range combat in Shanghai in terms of psychological warfare.

Italy Will Not Participate in the War for the Time Being

According to an article by Mr. Woolf published in the famous American magazine "Modern History," Italy will certainly not participate in the European war recently. The longer the European war lasts, the more opportunities Italy has to bargain with Germany or the Allies. The more financial resources, manpower, and material resources the two warring countries in Europe spend, the stronger Italy's naval and military strength is than other countries. The longer the European war lasts, the more say Mussolini will have at the future peace conference. At that time, other powers will have fought to the point of exhaustion, while Italy will still be the only strong country in Europe, unaffected by economic panic and social revolution. A politician who can achieve his goals without launching a war is the most successful in the world. Hitler, Stalin, Chamberlain, and Daladier had to engage in war to meet the needs of their countries. Mussolini is currently enjoying enthusiastic support from the public in Italy, because Italy can still be the only major "non-belligerent" country when the European war is at its most intense. Therefore, as the European war continues to develop, Italy, with its status as a non-belligerent country, may be the only victorious country.

Outstanding Achievements of Young British Overseas Chinese

Thomas, the son of Mr. Devitt, a British overseas Chinese and manager of the printing department of the Shanghai North-China Daily News & Herald, joined the British Royal Air Force in August last year and served on the front line. He has achieved outstanding results. Recently, his family received a telegram informing them that Thomas has received a special air force medal. When he was in Shanghai, he studied at a church school and was fond of sports. He left Shanghai for England in 1934 and studied at Magdalen College in Oxford.

### Daylight Saving Time Can Be Achieved

Hong Kong and Xiamen Will Also Follow Suit

According to the Continental News, the daylight saving time suggested by the Shanghai Public Concession’s Municipal Council has been enthusiastically supported by Chinese and foreign circles along the Chinese coast. Even the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, which initially expressed dissatisfaction, has also stated its support. Therefore, it is expected that this city and major coastal cities such as Hong Kong and Xiamen will uniformly move their clocks forward one hour from the afternoon of the 11th of this month. After the Municipal Council adopted the principle of daylight saving time, it immediately sent letters to the French Concession and the authorities of various coastal ports. It is heard that Hong Kong has replied, stating its full agreement. Although this statement has not been officially confirmed, well-informed sources say that the French Concession authorities have already expressed their readiness to implement daylight saving time within the concession. It is expected that the Municipal Council directors will pass the daylight saving time measure without reservation at a special meeting to be held next Wednesday.

### June 3rd Opium Suppression Day: Anti-Drug Movement

Unanimous Response from All Circles

This year's June 3rd Opium Suppression Day has been stipulated by the central government, and the national anti-smoking movement will be promoted uniformly in order to eradicate the scourge of drugs and promote national health. Since the withdrawal of the national army from Shanghai and the loss of political guidelines, the opium ban has been abolished. To this day, sales are openly organized and smoking is common in the alleys. The harm is unprecedented. Therefore, all circles will unanimously respond to the anti-drug movement at that time, widely publicize it, and persuade gentlemen in the sea of sin to turn back quickly, in order to correct the situation and maintain public security.

### Silver and Money Industry Ordered to Stop Doing Warehousing Receipt Loans

The Silver and Money Industry Association has received an order from the Ministry of Finance that banks and money shops are not allowed to make warehousing receipt or warehouse receipt loans in the future, so as to avoid indirectly helping merchants hoard goods. It is heard that these loans are limited to daily necessities, such as food, coal balls, yarn, cloth, soap, and matches. The banks and money shops have now complied with the order.

### Far East Route: Beautiful Journey

Italian Cargo Ships Sail to Shanghai as Usual

After the US Mail Steamship Company planned to stop the ships traveling between Europe and Asia due to the US government's imminent participation in the European war, it was learned from the reporter of the New Voice News Agency that ships of other neutral countries will continue to maintain navigation between Europe and the Far East. The transportation and loading of goods will not be affected by the suspension of Italian merchant ships.

The Italian cargo ship "Quirico Gluck" is currently berthed at the company's dock with empty cargo. However, the ship and the "Telamone" will continue to carry cargo to Europe. The "Quirico Gluck" is scheduled to sail to South China within the week, and the "Telamone" will come to Shanghai in the first week of next month. After a short stay in Shanghai, it will continue to sail to Europe. The various President ships of the American President Lines have decided to continue sailing between the Far East and Europe, maintaining normal navigation. The New Voice News Agency learned from the American

President Lines that the company's Adams, Garfield, Harrison, and Baker will come to Shanghai one after another this summer. The Garfield will set sail from Europe via the Suez Canal on June 15 to China. The Adams is scheduled to depart for China on July 17, the Harrison at the end of July, and the Baker on September 12. It is heard that the company also has three ships, the Hibaas, Mongolia, and Bayard, which will no longer pass through the Suez Canal in the future, but will instead take the Cape of Good Hope and travel between New York and the Far East via Manila, Hong Kong, and Singapore. It is also stipulated that these three ships will not call at Shanghai.

### Strict Crackdown on Rice Mixed with Inferior Goods

Violators Will Be Punished According to Regulations

Previously, Shanghai's rice market was monopolized and manipulated by rice merchants, resulting in soaring prices. Some unscrupulous merchants still mixed inferior goods into high-quality rice, deceiving buyers and selling them at high prices, making profits that were indeed unscrupulous. The authorities of the two concessions have repeatedly strictly prohibited this. Now, most rice merchants have followed the regulations, but there are still many who ignore them. Recently, the authorities decided to strictly crack down on them. If the same incident occurs again in the future, they will be punished according to the regulations.

### Shanghai Trade Unions Send Joint Telegram to Salute Soldiers in Henan and Hubei; Successful Use of Novel Strategy Achieves Unprecedented Success; Growing Confidence that the Foundation for Final Victory is Solidified

The Shanghai trade unions believed that the battle of Henan and Hubei, in which we achieved an unprecedented victory, was of great importance to the entire war situation. Therefore, yesterday, they sent a joint telegram to Commander Li Zongren and the soldiers on the front line to express their congratulations and condolences. The original telegram said: Commander Li Zongren De Lin, and transferred to all the officers and soldiers on the front line, Jianjian, in the battle of Henan and Hubei, we deployed our troops for thousands of miles, annihilated tens of thousands of enemies, and achieved unprecedented success with a novel strategy. The foundation for final victory has been further consolidated. When the good news came, the whole country rejoiced. The Shanghai trade unions, on behalf of their 800,000 members, send a remote telegram to express their congratulations and give the highest respect. Shanghai trade unions kowtow. Please note.

### Japanese Indulgence and Entertainment: A Sign of Decline; Japanese Youths in Hongkou Revel in Drinking and Singing; Domestic Poverty and War Fatigue; Soviet Far East Defenses Strengthen

According to yesterday's Japanese-language *Continental News*, Aikawa, Deputy Director of the Japanese-Asia Institute's Central China Liaison Department, stated that Japanese youths residing in the Hongkou area of Shanghai have recently indulged in entertainment, reveling in drinking and singing, forgetting the hardships at the front lines and the perilous state of the nation. This kind of behavior, like the madness and decline of the fin de siècle, is not a good omen. Therefore, he issued a statement urging these people to reflect. According to yesterday's *Mainichi Shimbun* statistics, there are 70,000 Japanese residents in Shanghai, with 330 restaurants, 54 cafes, and 25 high-end restaurants. It can be seen that this kind of business is thriving. The Japanese people's frugality was once known throughout the world, but recently the atmosphere has suddenly changed.

According to someone who recently came to Shanghai from Japan, this kind of decadent atmosphere is also a general phenomenon in Japan. Since the invasion of China three years ago, the decline in foreign trade and the domestic economy approaching collapse have been undeniable facts. After the defeats of the Japanese army in northern Guangdong, Guangxi, northern Jiangxi, and northern Hubei, they could no longer count on military victories.

Politically,

the intention was to use the puppet "government" to resolve the China Incident, but this yielded no results. When Abe Nobuyuki was dispatched to China this time, he had great missions and hopes, but now he is heartbroken at the sight of the lack of prospects, which was completely unexpected. Therefore, Abe has closed his doors to guests in Nanjing, refusing to meet even important figures from the puppet regime, leading to

rumors that Abe

had already gone to Vietnam. Due to the above circumstances, the Japanese people feel the futility of the costly war of aggression and are oppressed by increasingly impoverished daily lives. Their war-weariness is deep, but they dare not openly oppose the war. Their hearts are filled with anxiety, and with no way to express it, they indulge in entertainment and drown their sorrows in alcohol as a form of anesthesia. This tragic scene is one that people both at home and abroad view with immense sympathy.

The Soviet Union Fully Defends Against Japan

Recently, a Westerner came to Shanghai from Harbin and reported that although the Soviet Union is paying close attention to the European war, it has not relaxed its defenses against Japan in the slightest. The Soviet Union has not only strengthened the necessary military defenses along its Far Eastern border, but is also actively enriching its economic construction, striving to make the Far East self-sufficient and self-reliant, so that in the event of a need to fight on both the eastern and western fronts, the Far East will not have to rely on supplies from elsewhere in the country. The

heavy industry in the Far East is currently being rapidly expanded. For example, the large-scale ironworks in Somolysk, the ironworks in Chaote, and other factories under construction will all complete their construction ahead of schedule (according to the Third Five-Year Plan, they should be completed in 1942). The

arsenals and military supply factories in Khabarovsk are busy increasing production and stockpiling raw materials. The oil refinery in Khabarovsk has also begun operations. Regarding military transportation, the construction of a railway and its branch lines that run parallel to Siberia, winding westward for about 1,300 miles, is proceeding in great secrecy, but it is not far from complete. Regarding food, mechanization of agriculture is underway, and immigration is encouraged, with excellent results. The fact that some immigrants come from as far away as Ukraine shows the Soviet Union's active development of agriculture in the Far East. According to the Westerner's observation, although Japan and the Soviet Union both have a desire for rapprochement, the conflict of interests between them has become a barrier that is difficult to eliminate. Therefore, they both have to prepare to win in a possible future military conflict.

### Domestically Produced Goods Shipped to Southeast Asia: Sales Double

Overseas Chinese in Europe Relocate and Do Business; Patriotic Support and Promotion of Domestically Produced Goods

A reporter from the *New Voice News* learned yesterday from domestic goods organizations in this city that after the European war intensified, overseas Chinese residing in Europe have been flocking to various territories in Southeast Asia to do business. With a strong sense of patriotism, they are sparing no effort to boycott Japanese goods, vigorously promote domestic goods, assist local merchants, and strongly encourage the use of domestic goods. Whenever someone purchases domestic goods, they explain in detail the exquisite quality and durability of domestic goods. As a result, the shipping and sales of domestic goods to Southeast Asia have doubled, and they are quite popular with the local people. This greatly benefits the war of resistance and national reconstruction. It is understood that electrical appliances, enamelware, cotton textiles, and knitwear are the main products sold in the area. At a time when domestic factories are struggling to sell their products, the only outlet is to develop overseas markets, because overseas Chinese support domestic goods as much as people in the country do.

### Two Labor Disputes

Slowdown at Jingxin Printing House; Workers at Bada Factory on Hunger Strike

Jingxin Bookstore

All workers at the Jingxin Printing House at 94 Glock Road went on strike due to unmet demands for improved treatment. It is understood that all workers at the printing house requested a 20 yuan increase in allowance in writing on the 21st of this month, because their wages were insufficient to maintain a livelihood. They also requested bathing facilities due to the hot weather. The employer did not reply, so the workers began a slowdown on the 24th. Yesterday, the employer notified all workers through a lawyer to complete the handover procedures, allegedly to replace them with new workers. However, all workers are still continuing to negotiate frankly with the employer in order to break the deadlock.

Bada Silk Factory

More than 70 workers went on a hunger strike after their request for a wage increase was denied. The Bada Silk Factory on Haining Road, Henan Road, is quite large, employing more than 150 people. Recently, as prices have risen even higher, the female workers in the preparation department and the machine operators found that their daily wages of 60-70 cents were not enough to live on. When their request to the employer was denied and they had nowhere to turn, more than 70 of them went on a hunger strike in the factory to awaken the employer. They also plan to ask the Industrial Section of the Municipal Council to mediate as soon as possible.

### Municipal Council Staff Preparing for Salary Increase

Personnel Committee Meeting Discussed

Due to soaring prices and difficult living conditions, Chinese and Western staff of the Shanghai Municipal Council are preparing for a salary increase. A reporter from *Pingming News* inquired about this matter with the Municipal Council. It is understood that the Municipal Council is quite aware of the common desire of its Chinese and foreign staff for a salary increase. However, as of recently, the Council staff has not made any collective formal demands or proposals. The Municipal Council is now considering it. The Municipal Council Personnel Committee held a meeting in the conference room at 5 p.m. the day before yesterday.

### Another Agency Established to Control Vegetables and Local Produce

In addition to the "Central Market" at the bridgehead of Xizang Road and the "Food Market" on Wusong Road, the Japanese puppet organization controlling vegetables and local produce in the city has recently created a "Shanghai Market," leading to intensified competition. Local vegetable and produce merchants are already facing ubiquitous traps and are in dire straits. The control methods of the "Shanghai Market" are similar to those of the "Food Market" on Wusong Road, levying a 3% tax on the cargo price "to allow merchants to operate freely." Its control extends to local produce transported to Shanghai via the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways. Transportation companies have immense power after transporting goods, and local produce merchants on both routes are caught in their net. Now that the "markets" are encroaching on each other, it is the general cargo merchants who suffer.

### Quakers' Friendship Society Shelters Homeless Children; Remarkable Success in Psychological Treatment; Unhappy Children Enjoy New Lives

According to *Continental News*, the Quakers' Friendship Society, observing that street children are forced by circumstances to become petty thieves, established a "Reception Center" at No. 8, Lane 1086, Yu Yuan Road, to shelter homeless children and provide them with psychological "treatment." A reporter recently visited the center, which currently houses 17 children who are treated with great kindness. During the day, they either sit around a round table reading and writing, or gather in groups on the sunny lawn,

jumping and playing. Those who are ill receive medical treatment, and the bedding on the beds is clean and tidy. The matron of the center, Ms. Bella Hannah, is kind and friendly. When speaking with the reporter, she was wiping a child's wound. According to Ms. Bella, one-third of the homeless children have wounds on their bodies when they enter the center. They are first brought to the police station by the police, and are extremely frightened and dare not speak. After being sent to the "Reception Center," they are soothed with gentle words.

Their accounts of how they ended up on the streets are almost identical: either they were separated from their parents during the Shanghai war in 1937, or they were abused at home and ran away on their own, ending up on the streets, destitute and helpless, for several months before being sent here by the police. However, they refuse to say how they managed to survive for months on the streets. After arriving at the center, they see that everyone is friendly, and their anxieties disappear, and they happily begin their new lives. According to Ms. Chen, the caregiver at the center, there are no difficulties in accommodating these homeless children. If they are treated properly, then

they can easily be educated. The most difficult thing is to get the children to clean themselves when they first arrive at the center. The following incident can represent the past experiences of each of the children. There is a boy named Kong Hedi (transliteration), who is only seven years old. His appearance already shows signs of hardship. There are dark blue marks of beatings on his legs and body, which shows that he was severely treated by his stepmother at home. Unable to bear the suffering, he ran away and became a street child, and was soon

arrested by the police and sent to the "Reception Center." He will be sent back home after staying for about two weeks. The child claims that his home is near the No. 2 bus station and a butcher shop on Qiujiang Road. People from the Municipal Council's Child Protection Section will search for it according to the address and visit the "Reception Center" regularly. If the child's parents do not want him to return home, then he will be sent to an orphanage,

taught a skill, and be able to support himself. Now, in the "Reception Center," they are made to forget their criminal tendencies and encouraged to love cleanliness and self-sufficiency, such as making their beds and cleaning their bedrooms, and they are taught daily lessons. After two weeks, they are sent back home. As for the child's future, it will depend on himself.

### Ningbo Native Association Solicits Donations for Low-Priced Grain

The Ningbo Shanghai Native Association has established a fundraising committee to relieve the famine in its hometown. It has decided to raise one million yuan, divided into special donations and industry donations, soliciting donations from individuals and various industries. Kui Yanfang, Zhang Lianfang, Ding Fangyuan, Chen Qingzhao, Le Rucheng, Liu Liangcai, Ge Weian, and other seven people have been appointed as general managers from the standing committee, and they will be at the meeting every day to preside over the fundraising matters. They are soliciting donations separately every day, and donors are very enthusiastic.

The Three-North low-priced grain business is being managed diligently by the Three-North Shanghai Native Low-Priced Grain Association. Zhang Chude, representative of 560,000 people in northern Yao, sent a letter yesterday thanking Yu Qiaqing for his sincere concern for disaster relief. There were also letters from natives in northern Ci to Yu accusing village chiefs of deducting low-priced grain. According to a member of the low-priced grain association, the organization was originally founded by Yu Zhiqing and Shen Weiting, giants from the Three-North area in Shanghai. When the hometown was hit by a rice shortage and the village chiefs from various towns sent letters to Yu asking for low-priced relief, they enthusiastically donated in Shanghai Native Association. When they were hoping to continue purchasing rice for low-priced relief, they suddenly received letters from the people of northern Ci accusing the few village chiefs of taking the opportunity to deduct the quantity of low-priced rice, which was in violation of the original intention of five kilograms per person. For example, (1) Rong Shaopang, chief of Huodong Township in northern Ci, sold only three kilograms to each villager, privately selling the remaining two kilograms for personal gain; (2) Yu Ruizhang, chief of Huxi Township in northern Ci, sold only three kilograms and four taels or half a kilogram to each person; (3) Yang Qian, second village chief of Fuhai Township in northern Ci, sold only four kilograms and eight taels out of the five kilograms per person. If true, please send a letter directly to the local military and police authorities to arrest and punish them as a warning.

### Ningbo Port Import and Export Duty; Ningbo Has Already Stopped Collecting; Ningbo Shanghai Native Association Has Received Reply Telegram

The Ningbo Party Bureau previously promulgated a method to raise funds for poor people's food. All cargo transported by commercial ships entering and leaving Ningbo Port and stored in warehouses would be subject to a relief fee of 5%. The Ningbo Shanghai Native Association sent two telegrams requesting a postponement, as the matter was tantamount to disguised additional taxes. According to a message from the association yesterday, the Ningbo side had been requested to raise funds for poor people's relief by other means and to cancel the 5% tax on goods. A reply telegram had been received from the Ningbo side, especially to stop it.

### Tap Water Surcharge to Increase Again Next Month; City's Hot Water Shops Request Preferential Treatment

In view of soaring prices and increasing expenses, the Shanghai Waterworks Company has attached a revised budget for this year and submitted it to the Municipal Council last month, requesting that the current 50% surcharge on tap water be increased to 110% starting June 1st. The Council's Public Utilities Committee put it forward for discussion at its first meeting on the 9th of this month and it has been approved. After the news became public, users were shocked. According to inquiries made by a reporter from the *New Voice News*, the city's more than 500 hot water shops have always had preferential treatment for monthly water consumption, and the company has a very harmonious and close relationship with the shops. However, this time, the increase in water fees seems to have disregarded the preferential treatment for the hot water shops, so the shop owners are very apprehensive and have separately sent letters to the Shanghai Hot Water Industry Association, requesting them to prepare a document for negotiation in order to reduce the expenditure. It is understood that the reasons for their request are nothing more than the high price of coal, rising prices of all goods, and the difficulty in covering daily operating expenses. If the water price is doubled again, they will have to close their doors. For the sake of their future and the health of the citizens, they have no choice but to take this action, so they hope that the company will approve it within a possible range.

Investigation of Evidence Not Permitted; Judge Recusal Requested

### Soviet Union Emphasizes Children's Education

Book Publications More Than Six Times Higher Than Before; National Experts Write for Children

(TASS) The Soviet Union places exceptional emphasis on children's education. In 1939, a total of 1,643 types of children's books were published, totaling 41 million copies, more than six times the number of books published during the Tsarist era.

These children's books are both beautiful and informative. The authors tell readers about reality and develop their will, creativity, and collective spirit. The style of famous Soviet writers such as Mayakovsky is all aimed at this goal.

Most children's books are about the evolution of civilization, natural history, and industrial development. Writers are not limited to famous writers, but also include scientists, inventors, and explorers, all of whom write for children. For example, Papernin wrote a children's book describing his experiences exploring the Arctic. In addition, Chkalov and others also wrote books describing their journey flying over North America to the Arctic.

Mythology also occupies an important position in children's literature. Many works by Pushkin and Shakespeare are published.

There are 55 children's newspapers and 120,000 children's libraries.

### Sichuan Province Provides Relief to Elementary School Teachers, Promotes "One Dou of Rice" Campaign

One Dou of Rice Per Month in Addition to Salary

(Weiyuan Correspondence) The salaries of elementary school teachers in Weiyuan County were extremely low. Only after the establishment of the Education Subsidy Fundraising Committee this year were they modestly increased. The monthly salary for elementary school principals is 22 yuan, the monthly salary for elementary school teachers and short course elementary school principals is 20 yuan, and the monthly salary for elementary school teachers is 18 yuan, all paid according to the December standard. Although this is double the amount paid in the first half of 1939, the soaring prices have made the teachers' plight ten times worse than before. Due to budget constraints, the government has no additional funds to raise, and the teachers have no rice to cook, which will inevitably lead to the closure of schools, with far-reaching effects. Local party and government organs and community organizations in the county seat have launched a "One Dou of Rice" campaign as a remedy. County Magistrate Cheng personally wrote to the heads of various Lianbao (joint security units) to earnestly promote the campaign. The method involves the Lianbao heads convening meetings of local gentry and students' families to solicit donations, with the goal of providing each teacher in each school with one dou of rice per month in addition to their original salary. It is reported that several townships have widely promoted the campaign, and progress is proceeding smoothly.

### Zong Jing Cup Table Tennis Semifinals: Huayi A Holds Absolute Advantage

Qingyun A Loses Again, Championship Hopes Dashed; Upset Occurs, Qingyun Xin Defeats Youbang

In the first match of the Zong Jing Cup table tennis semifinals the day before yesterday, Qingyun Xin pulled off another upset against Youbang. It was unexpected as Youbang had a strong lineup and was considered a top contender, but due to the absence of Rong Deneng, they suffered a 3-4 defeat against Qingyun Xin, which had an impact on their championship prospects. Youbang still has three matches remaining against Qingyun A, Post Office A, and Huayi A. If they can win all three matches, they will still need to compete with Huayi A in the final to determine the champion. In the first match, Huayi A easily defeated Gonghua 5-2. Yesterday evening at 7:00 PM, Huayi A played against Qingyun A. This match was crucial for both sides. If Qingyun A won, then Huayi A and Youbang would each have lost once, giving them hope for the championship. At the start of the match, Qingyun A took the lead with a burst of energy, winning three consecutive games. However, Huayi A did not lose heart and relied on their overall strength to reverse the situation and win 4-3, which was no easy feat. Huayi A has now won four matches in a row and holds an absolute advantage. The only team that can compete with them is Youbang. If Youbang can defeat Post Office A and Qingyun A in succession, they can still compete with Huayi A for the championship. Otherwise, even if Huayi A loses to Youbang, they will still be able to win the championship. The results are as follows:

Qingyun Xin defeats Youbang 4-3

Huayi A defeats Gonghua 5-2

Huayi A defeats Qingyun A 4-3

On the Lido side, Yan Shixin was limited by a foot injury and played goalkeeper, while Zheng Tongyu was active on the front lines. Under the leadership of Sun Jinshun, Lido, together with Meng Yiliang and Zheng Tongyu, formed a formidable offensive line. Shortly after the start of the match, Meng Yiliang scored, and Sun scored again, piercing the steel gate. Zheng Tongyu received a pass from Ah Cai and poked the ball into the upper right corner. The first half ended with Lido leading by three goals. After the switch, Meng Yiliang broke through the center, making it four to zero. After the big victory, Lido inevitably became negligent, and Jim managed to pass two goals. As a result, Lido won 4-2.

Yan Shixin, Jiang Chao, Zhang Lingen (up), Meng Yiliang (down), Cai Zhisen, Sun Jinshun, Meng Yiliang (up), Zhang Lingen (down), Zheng Tongyu

Youyou Defeats Baimen

Youyou and Baimen played very politely. Baimen has a lot of players, and they used them all. The lineup was new again yesterday. They temporarily pulled in the judge Zhang Le to make up the numbers. Both sides made it clear that if a goal was scored, it would not be counted. In the first half, Youyou only scored one goal by Hu Boyong, taking the lead 1-0. At the start of the second half, Baimen's midfielder Luo Lu scored, tying the game at 1-1. Youyou brought in new players, Zhou Qilin and Cao Qinfang, who scored two goals in a row, and Youyou won 3-1.

### From the Suspension of the Dutch Guilder in Shanghai to Foreign Currency Deposits

— Mu Shensi

Since the German army invaded Dutch territory, the Shanghai Dutch guilder exchange market has been suspended (May 13th). Anyone holding Dutch guilder remittances or deposits, because there is no exchange rate to convert them into legal tender or other currencies, is temporarily unable to use them, which is tantamount to being detained. The damage suffered can be imagined. Furthermore, prior to the Dutch guilder, there was also the German mark, which had already been suspended last year (September 4th) due to the outbreak of the European war, and it has been nine months now. Fortunately, the trading of Dutch and German currencies in Shanghai was not significant, and the damage suffered was limited. Also, because few people knew about it, the general public did not pay much attention to it. However, the seriousness of its significance cannot be ignored. If the Dutch guilder and German mark have been suspended one after another, then due to the shift in the situation, how can we determine that other foreign currencies have no possibility of suspension? In the past, people in our country took storing domestic currency as a principle, and few people stored foreign currencies except for import and export merchants. But now it is different. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Nationalists have been scrambling to purchase foreign exchange. Initially, it was only for the escape of funds by the wealthy. Later, the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange shrunk, and those with weak wills mistakenly believed that the foundation of the legal tender was shaking. As soon as they had any assets, they rushed to purchase foreign currencies, thinking it was a good deal. It has come to the point where they are willing to purchase and store foreign currencies at four or five times the price, and the danger is something that those people cannot anticipate. I am not smart, but I have to speak out about what I think is dangerous, express my humble opinions, and hope to discuss it with readers:

The escape of funds is an unavoidable phenomenon during wartime, but at that time, there was only the Sino-Japanese War, and other countries were peaceful. Purchasing and storing foreign currencies may have been justifiable. Now, the European war is increasingly expanding, and our country may be affected. Once the situation changes and a certain currency is suspended, then those who have stored that currency will inevitably be caught off guard, be subject to being frozen, and it will be too late to regret. Those who have foreign currencies should consider this, this is the first point.

In this uncertain world situation, "exchange control" and "currency devaluation" are not only natural phenomena for losing countries, but also possible measures for winning countries. In other words, they are not only suitable for countries with financial difficulties, but also for countries with superior economies. For example, Italy has implemented exchange control, and Italian currency cannot be remitted abroad, which has been the case for several years. Another example is the US dollar, the currency of the wealthiest country in the world, which has already devalued by 59.06%, and there are widespread rumors that it may be devalued again due to the sharp drop in the British-American exchange rate. The "external value of a country's currency, whether too high or too low, is not appropriate." The so-called "control" and "devaluation" are the application of modern economic policies. This is the second point.

Some people think that depositing a certain currency in a local foreign bank is actually still deposited locally. This is a psychological illusion. According to the facts, all foreign currency deposits have already been remitted abroad. If an incident occurs in a certain country and the local currency is suspended as a result, then the money will inevitably be unable to be converted back into domestic currency. In other words, it will not be possible to withdraw the deposit, because it has been blocked by the foreign country. This must be known, this is the third point.

Some people say that buying and storing foreign banknotes is better than depositing foreign exchange, but everyone knows that any country's banknotes are only used domestically, and their value abroad is because of the exchange rate. Once a currency is suspended, the banknote will lose its value in the same way. The current Dutch banknote is a clear example. In the past, the victims of the bankruptcy of the Mark and Ruble were those who held them abroad, while Germany and Russia each had considerable gains. In addition, the value of banknotes is lower than the value of exchange, because interest, transportation, and insurance costs must be deducted. This is the case in peacetime, let alone during wartime when traffic is obstructed, and everyone suffers losses, especially with so few holdings.

Some people say that buying and storing gold bars is ultimately a tangible asset, which is the best way to go, but unbeknownst to you, gold has already been nationalized. The Shanghai environment is special, and the government's decrees are temporarily not in place, so there is a black market for gold, and its value has soared, exceeding the legal price of the central bank by several times. Even if the government does not confiscate it after the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, but collects it at the legal price, the loss to the buyer is already considerable. Moreover, the United States is currently experiencing a panic over too much gold, and there are frequent arguments for lowering the price of gold. Those who have gold should also consider this, this is the fifth point.

Furthermore, recently the trend of foreign exchange is likely to rise. The main factors can be considered as four: (1) A certain party specializing in manipulating foreign exchange is now a supplier. It is said that this is to convert it into legal tender in order to collect local goods for export, so the sale of foreign exchange does not require purchase, and it can be supplied from this source. This is evidenced by the fact that a certain foreign bank has been selling spot goods and shorting futures for days, and this statement seems credible. (2) The world situation is deteriorating, and the funds of various countries' Far East territories, as well as the deposits of overseas Chinese in various places, are afraid of being controlled by the authorities, and they are coming to Shanghai for refuge in large numbers. (3) Banks of various countries that are currently involved in the European war, as well as banks in certain countries that are rumored to be about to join the war, will inevitably sell foreign exchange and convert it into legal tender to meet the withdrawals of depositors. (4) According to experts, the imports to Shanghai are decreasing and the outstanding foreign exchange is few. On the other hand, the peak season for exports has arrived, and in the future, the foreign exchange market will inevitably have excess demand. In addition to the above four points, the recent unprecedented victory in the Battle of Henan-Hubei has further strengthened the confidence of the people in the legal tender, which is another reason why foreign exchange is likely to fall and is difficult to rise in the future. Those who are good at speculating in foreign exchange have already seen this, and there is no need for me to elaborate. However, the general public has no connection with foreign exchange, does not know what foreign exchange is, and lacks economic common sense, let alone the reality and evolution of the world economic situation. These people may be confused by the profits of speculation, or injured by rumors, blindly follow the crowd, and rush to purchase foreign exchange or foreign banknotes, which is really reckless. Even if their foreign currency is fortunate enough not to encounter "suspension of exchange" or "devaluation," once the completion of the War of Resistance is achieved, the black market will end, and it will inevitably be settled at the legal exchange rate (one shilling and two and a half pence for British pound, twenty yuan for US dollar), then their assets will have already lost 70% to 80%. Why not, in today's situation where our country's military is progressing smoothly, convert the foreign currency into legal tender, invest in the Southwest under the leadership of the national bank, seek construction for the country, and create happiness for future generations, so that you can enjoy the rights of "guaranteed interest" and "profit sharing" (see the recent newspaper reports). Compared with storing foreign currency, using valuable financial resources to be used exclusively by foreigners, and being in an extremely dangerous world situation, where it is easy to suffer the risk of partial or total loss, is this not an obvious choice between wisdom and foolishness?

Furthermore, the first paragraph of the ninth section was published in the previous issue. For the convenience of readers, it is republished here for consistency.

"Natural Level" and "Artificial Level"

There may be many people who are currently studying: "Is the current rate of three and a half pence per British pound and four yuan six eight seven five per US dollar the new natural level?" Some may even be trying to figure out, "How long will this level remain stable?"

According to their speculative experience, general speculators imagine that the so-called "natural level" must be a lower exchange rate than before. Therefore, every time there is a trend in the black exchange market, a new so-called "natural level" is produced; and each new "natural level" always causes the black exchange price to shrink by 10% to 20%. I think this is an insult to the "natural level." The spokesman of the Ministry of Finance often hopes that the black exchange market will generate a "natural level" in free fluctuations. If he also regards a lower exchange rate as a "natural level," it is also an unparalleled mistake.

According to the above-mentioned key factors in determining international exchange rates: the main factor in international exchange rates is not whether the monetary elements and currency values are balanced, but whether the trade in goods is balanced. To discuss the trend of trade balance, one should observe the trend of wartime trade according to the legal exchange rate of one shilling and two and a half pence. If the black exchange price is used to calculate, then the result obtained is only a monetary phenomenon, only a price phenomenon, not the truth of trade in goods. Only from the truth of trade in goods can we discover how the main factors determining the exchange rate are changing, so we can judge whether the current black exchange market is reasonable? Is it in line with the meaning of the so-called "natural level?"

If this theory is correct, then the trend of trade balance in our country during the war is not only not worse than before the war, but also has made great progress compared with before the war. This progress is by no means a wild boast, because the new construction during the war is enough to offset part of the destruction under the flames of artillery fire, and high prices naturally save part of the consumption. If the situation in the interior is not enough to represent the situation in the whole country, then let's take a step back and take Shanghai's foreign trade in the occupied areas as an example. Shanghai's trade has always accounted for more than half of the total trade in the country. Then, the actual performance of Shanghai's trade balance should powerfully affect the trend of international exchange rates.

Shanghai's foreign trade has always shown a deficit of more than 200 million to 500 million yuan. But since the start of the war, the deficit has gradually been reduced. For example, in the 26th year of the Republic [1937], it was reduced to 105 million yuan, in the 27th year [1938] it was reduced to 47 million yuan, and in the 28th year [1939], it changed from a deficit to a surplus of more than 11 million yuan. Although this does not include private imports, the quantity of private exports is probably even greater than private imports. The progress of this trade balance is precisely the best condition reflected in the foreign exchange market. So if we want to talk about the "natural level," it should be a higher exchange rate, not a lower exchange rate. And the current exchange rate? It can only be said to be an "artificial level."

From the actual balance of trade in goods: this "artificial level" has clearly created the effect of suppressing imports. But from the perspective of monetary phenomena: it has caused great losses to importers. That is, they pay a lot of money, but import less goods than in the past. Therefore, from the monetary phenomenon, that is, according to the black exchange price to observe Shanghai's current trade balance, it is not only still a deficit, but also an unprecedentedly large deficit. The currency value of the deficit in the 28th year [1939] is as high as 850 million yuan.

Trade in goods is actually a surplus, but the reflection on the monetary balance sheet forms an unprecedented deficit. The unreasonableness of this monetary phenomenon can be imagined: the black exchange market has created this unreasonable phenomenon. Therefore, if people want to ensure your wealth, there is only one way: do not contact the black exchange market. Therefore, when the government implements a low exchange rate policy towards the black exchange market in order to adjust the international balance of payments, those who are hit are only the Japanese and puppets who try to buy up our foreign exchange. Because the target of the government's attack under this policy is the Japanese and puppets, not the general public. If someone thinks that the legal tender is depreciating because of entering and exiting the black exchange market, in fact, the general legal tender has not depreciated. What has depreciated is only the legal tender that enters and exits the black exchange market. This is self-inflicted, and they can only blame themselves. If the Japanese and puppets' buying and speculators' activities in the black exchange market stop, then the black exchange price will inevitably rise naturally in the trade balance that is determined by trade in goods. This is the "natural level" in the black exchange market. In short: as long as the artificial pressure on the black market is reduced, then it will jump up.

Foreign Currency Value and Speculative Profits

With the fall of the black exchange price, the value of foreign currencies seems to have risen sharply on the surface. Those who hoard foreign exchange also seem to have made a lot of money on the surface. For example, if they bought US$5.75 with 100 yuan of legal tender on May 1st, and on May 3rd, the US dollar has shrunk to 4.3125 yuan. Then his US$5.75 can buy 133.3432 yuan of legal tender. It seems that he has earned more than 33 yuan out of thin air. But unbeknownst to them, those US$5.75 were only worth 15.15 yuan of legal tender in the 2nd year. When he bought those US$5.75 with 100 yuan of legal tender, he actually lost more than 80 yuan of legal tender. If he now saves the 133.3432 yuan of legal tender he gets back, he will be able to buy more than 40 US dollars in the future. If you have to go to the United States to study right away, then with the approval of the Ministry of Education, the central bank can still sell you 20 to 30 US dollars right away after deducting the balance fee. So you seem to be making money by entering and exiting the black exchange market, but in reality, you are losing your capital greatly. The more times your legal tender enters and exits the black exchange market, the greater the loss to your actual property.

If you can understand historical facts, then you must remember: if a country's government has already destroyed foreign exchange, I will. Once it acts, it can restore the original state immediately. Like Germany and the Soviet Union, no matter how many millions of times the value of their rubles and marks has fallen below zero, as soon as their policies change, they will be reorganized in an instant. Moreover, the legal tender of China has not experienced currency inflation at all. China's human, material, and financial resources are much more abundant than those of Germany and the Soviet Union, so it is even easier to restore the original state. Can you say that the national spirit of China is not as good as that of Germany and the Soviet Union? What's more, China's war target is a paper tiger that is about to be torn apart. Compared to the enemies that Germany and the Soviet Union encountered at that time, it is simply insignificant.

Not only is the restoration of the true value of the legal tender inevitable, but the true value of foreign currencies is also about to be "revealed." The rise in foreign currencies in the black exchange market is not an increase in the true value of foreign currencies, but is reflected by the apparent depreciation of the legal tender in the black exchange market. The consequences of this reflection have added another layer of serious blow to the commercial status of European and American countries in China in addition to the exclusion of Japan. Look at the table below: In the import trade of China in the 26th and 28th years of the Republic [1937 and 1939], the proportion occupied by each country has only increased from 17.36% to 34.39% for Japan alone, and almost all others have decreased significantly. For example, the United Kingdom has decreased sharply from 11.68% to 5.80%: the United States has decreased sharply from 19.75% to 15.94%; France has decreased sharply from 1.58% to 0.84%; even Germany and Italy are being rejected in the same way. Germany has dropped from 15.31% to 6.49%, and Italy has also dropped from 1.04% to 0.83%. Except for Japan, no other country will be satisfied with this phenomenon. In other words: the existence of the black exchange market is a big loss for European and American groups and China, except for the convenience of Japan. However, European and American countries can temporarily take comfort in the fact that they can exchange a small number of goods for valuable prices for the time being. However, in the current drastic changes in the international political situation, countries that change monetary policies for political, military, and other reasons will probably emerge like bamboo shoots after a rain. The currencies of European warring countries are in danger, which goes without saying. Even the US dollar, how can it be unique? In the "European War Expansion and the Future of the US Dollar" section, it was pointed out that "the United States may not necessarily join the war immediately, but economic assistance to the Allied forces is necessary." Judging from the stability of the British-American exchange rate today, which is no longer as rapidly changing as before, it is probably a way for him to assist the Allied forces?

The Maximum Extent of Japanese and Puppet Sabotage

As for the sabotage of the Japanese and puppets, it is not to be feared. Because they are already "willing but unable." Everyone knows: to sabotage, you need to have the strength to sabotage; the so-called strength is that you must first prepare a huge amount of legal tender capital before you can jump into the black market and snatch wildly. In the past: he used guns to force the people of North China to hand over legal tender, and the handed over legal tender has already been looted and has been exhausted by him, and the hoarded legal tender has been hoarded to the point where he cannot loot it. Therefore, one of the sources for him to obtain large amounts of legal tender has now disappeared. As for Central and Southern China, because the foundation of the legal tender among the people is deeper, he has to abandon his dream of "eliminating the legal tender" and adopt the policy of "using the legal tender." In this way, although he obtains legal tender by exporting to China, in order to plunder China's native products, he still has to spit out legal tender. Therefore, the possibility of collecting legal tender from the trade aspect is far less than what people generally imagine. It is true that the customs duties have been seized, and more than 10 million yuan of legal tender can be obtained every month. But precisely because they have already learned not to "use the legal tender," therefore all of this legal tender has not been used to buy up foreign exchange. Therefore, although they have been planning to buy up foreign exchange, they are in fact restricted by the legal tender. In the past, every time they snatched foreign exchange, they had to go through a considerable period of time to prepare for the gathering of legal tender. In the future, this preparation time will of course be longer than in the past. No matter how long it takes him to collect legal tender, when he starts to buy up foreign exchange, if speculative Chinese merchants do not follow him to buy up at the same time, then his sabotage power will inevitably be weaker. Restraining the machine and following the Japanese and puppets to buy up foreign exchange is only helping the Japanese and puppets to boost the momentum of sabotaging the foreign exchange market; and it is also asking for trouble. Because the government has temporarily suspended supply in order to prevent the Japanese and puppets from buying up, and the original target of the attack is the Japanese and puppets. Speculators follow the Japanese and puppets to buy up, wouldn't they be asking for losses themselves? If only the Japanese and puppets are buying up and speculators do not follow, then although the situation will be temporarily tight due to the government's temporary suspension of supply, the tight situation will not be greater, and the rebounding force after the pressure is released will definitely be greater. This can be imagined.

Similarly; in order to satisfy his desire to "get promoted and make a fortune," the puppet side does have the intention of wantonly issuing small exchangeable banknotes to facilitate his plan to squeeze the people's fat and cream. However, the failures of "joint banknotes" and "China coupons" are precedents. This kind of waste paper does not help his pockets, so why bother? The reason why the puppet "central bank" has no opening date is this. However, since they came to power through looting, they will definitely do it regardless of success or failure as long as there is a possibility of looting. But it is harmless to the legal tender and harmless to foreign exchange, which is already obvious.

### A Way Out of the Impending Demise of Speculation

— Cao Zhenzhao

Since the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation abandoned maintaining the exchange rate of 4 1/8 on the second of this month, the British and American exchange rates have reached new peaks again. The black market premium reached 7,300 yuan. Foreign stocks have also risen to an extreme, with some exceeding ten or twenty times their face value. Within a single day, the market price of daily necessities has increased by more than 20%, and there are even doubts about changes to the legal tender's status. Therefore, in addition to the black market, there is also a gray market. In addition to official quotations, there are also unofficial quotations. The situation is erratic, beyond the power of words to describe. However, within just one week, Germany suddenly launched a blitzkrieg, entering France through the Netherlands and Belgium. The world economy underwent a major change. The British and American exchange rates once fell below 2.9 yuan, and American stocks plummeted for days, especially industrial stocks, which fell to an average of over 20 pounds. As a result, the Shanghai foreign exchange market suddenly lengthened, and the various foreign stocks of public associations fell sharply. Other markets also fluctuated erratically, without any fixed timing. The rise and fall of foreign exchange rates depend on the volume of import and export goods, and the high and low of stock prices depend on the development of the business itself, which no one can control. However, the various markets in Shanghai have become places monopolized by speculators. When domestic and international situations change, speculators take the opportunity to fuel the flames, manipulating the market. The general public, unaware of the dangers, mistakenly fall into their trap, suffering huge losses. On March 25th, I published an article in the economic supplement of this newspaper, analyzing the situation of foreign exchange premiums and stocks, and warned against speculation, intending it as a loyal admonition, which readers should still be able to recall. Unexpectedly, in less than two months, the positions of bulls and bears have already changed. In all fairness, the key to today's various markets in Shanghai lies in the current international situation. For example, when HSBC abandoned the 4 1/8 exchange rate, the U.S. dollar naturally tended to contract, but its momentum was not rapid. The speculators caused it to contract rapidly. When Germany used military force in France, all U.S. markets fell, and the U.S. dollar naturally lengthened, but its momentum was not rapid. The speculators also caused it to lengthen rapidly. Therefore, the so-called stocks, premiums, and various goods, whether high or low, are all determined by the trend of speculators. Once the speculators make a move, the general public follows suit. However, the opportunity for victory or defeat is determined in an instant. Often, speculators have already turned short into long, while the general public still sees short. Speculators have already turned long into short, while the general public still holds long. The difference between buying and selling is vast, beyond the expectation of the general public. It should be known that China uses legal tender as its standard. Since successive victories have been reported from the front lines, the status of legal tender has been invisibly elevated, and it has no relationship with the black market foreign exchange. Even the need to purchase foreign exchange for imported foreign goods is only a temporary need. Given the current treacherous international situation and frequent requisitions of foreign ships, international trade will gradually decrease in the future, and the need for foreign exchange will also gradually decrease. Anyone who is not engaged in import business must not purchase foreign exchange again, hastening their demise. Even those who have already purchased various goods should consider the market situation and not hoard them again. As for gold, it will inevitably be purchased by the state in the future, and there is no interest to speak of, while foreign stocks that can receive interest should not be underestimated. If one can maintain a firm principle and not give speculators an opportunity to exploit, the market will stabilize and finance will be secure. Although speculators are tigers, the floating capital is what makes them strong. According to external statistics, this kind of floating capital is indeed over 500 million yuan, a large part of which comes from mainland Chinese who have taken refuge in Shanghai. In this time of rising living costs and great difficulty in living, relying solely on deposits to earn meager interest from banks is not enough to maintain livelihood. Occasionally engaging in speculation to make a small profit is understandable. If there is a truly profitable path, they would not resort to risky and侥幸计策.

As for the general salaried class, seeing the daily increase in the cost of living, dazzled by high profits, forgetting the dangers, blindly following, if they are lucky enough to profit, the gains are minimal. If they are unfortunate enough to lose, they will inevitably be ruined and still not have enough, then their situation is even more pitiful. I believe that the way to health is to cultivate self-discipline, view wealth and status as fleeting clouds, and never be drawn into the whirlpool again, bringing trouble upon oneself, and especially not to turn long into short again, repeating the same mistakes. As for those who have cash or foreign exchange on hand but have no way to use it, one, it is best to deposit foreign exchange in the bank for a fixed period to earn interest, which can both ensure safety and generate interest. The bank will give preferential interest rates depending on the length of the fixed deposit. Two, if suffering from excess floating capital, the bank can open a special trust department to introduce investments in mainland factories, or provide planning and operational methods on preferential terms, and operate various mainland businesses on their behalf, and the bank or government can guarantee interest, transforming useless floating capital into useful capital. Three, if transferring funds to the mainland for deposit, the bank can offer preferential water rates and deposit interest rates according to the market. If the interest is to be used as living expenses, the matured interest can still be remitted to Shanghai at the original remittance fee and paid in legal tender. If, after a certain period of fixed deposit, one still wishes to withdraw funds in Shanghai, the bank can also remit the funds in full, subject to minimal restrictions. Moreover, if the remittance fee is longer than before, it can be calculated according to the new remittance fee, and vice versa, it can be calculated according to the old remittance fee, to show preferential treatment. The above points are just a brief outline, and the detailed plan should be carefully discussed by various economic experts. As for arbitrage with thick Taiwan interest rates, it is enough to promote the wind of speculation, and if the difference is too large, the risk is extremely high, and it should not be done. If floating capital can have a stable home, then the various industries and markets in Shanghai will be stable, and the production businesses in the mainland will also prosper. Those who possess floating capital, in this sound of rising exchange rates, falling gold prices, and falling goods prices, learning from past mistakes, should know where to go and what to do, without needing my verbose advice.

To Mr. Qu: Your letter has been forwarded to the China National Economic Research Institute. Where should the institute's publications be sent? Please let me know. Sincerely, Zhang Yifan

Commercial News

### Silver Inflation Intensifies

Bombay, 25th - The Indian silver market is strong, with spot and afternoon monthly contracts each rising sharply by 19 annas compared to the previous day. July contracts also rose by 18 annas. A total of 150 contracts were traded. The British and American silver markets are closed for the weekend as usual.

### Sugar Continues to Fall

Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained soft. The guild's spot price for 24 crude white goods ex-godown was 65 yuan 8 jiao to 9 jiao, a slight increase of 3-4 jiao. Transshipment goods arriving on June 1st were 53 yuan 8 jiao to 5 jiao, and those with godown receipts dated May 28th were 52 yuan 6 jiao, both rising by 2-3 jiao. Taikoo refined white sugar continued to decline, with little activity in B-mark transactions. The actual market price is unlikely to exceed 80 yuan. The sales of national sugar are also low, and the company still has goods on hand, so there are no new offers. It is said that activity may only resume after the festival.

### Orchid Rice Price is High

According to letters from the orchid rice producing areas, the price is relatively high due to demand from Hong Kong, so there have been no shipments to Shanghai for a long time. Judging from the production price, it is almost 20 yuan higher than the previous price in the Shanghai market, so there have been no further arrivals. Checks show that the grade A stock has run out, and only grade B goods remain, but they are not very marketable.

### Yantai Shrimp Tails are Fresh

New Yantai Longxu Island shrimp tails have already appeared on the market. Several pieces have arrived recently. The opening price for the first batch was 320 yuan. Yesterday, two more pieces arrived, with excellent quality and color, priced at 360 yuan. Both parties are in discussion and have not yet reached a deal.

### Pepper Continues to Fall

Recently, the exchange rate for pepper has risen sharply, and the inventory here is also quite full, so the market is seeing a continued decline. Currently, black pepper and number one pepper are both sold for 118 yuan, and white pepper is sold for 205 yuan to 190 yuan, a further small decrease of 5 yuan compared to the previous price.

### Binding Wire Prices Soar, New Discs Remain Firm and Expensive

Binding Wire: The binding wire market is exceptionally strong due to the lack of new arrivals and low inventory. Holders are unwilling to sell at low prices due to environmental factors, and the market situation is excellent. Buyers remain enthusiastic, including construction gangs, machinery factories, and Tianjin merchants. As a result, due to cost and market trends, prices have soared, rising from 62 yuan to 65 yuan per dan, and then from 65 yuan to 68 yuan. It is estimated that 300-400 dan were traded yesterday.

New Discs: Most new discs come from countries such as Britain, Belgium, Germany, and the United States. Since the expansion of the European war, the routes from the first three countries have been cut off. Currently, only the United States can ship to Shanghai, but transportation is quite difficult, and freight rates have doubled. The market price after arrival in Shanghai will undoubtedly increase. Although trading in recent shipments has been very quiet, standards remain firm and expensive. The reason for this is undoubtedly as described above. The current asking price is around 70 yuan per dan.

### Wool Prices Remain Firm and Expensive

On May 2nd, the black market exchange rate rose sharply, pushing from 4 offices to nearly 3 offices, causing significant changes in prices throughout the city. Wool, being an imported product, was also affected. On one hand, Western-style clothing customers and tailors rushed to buy from wool merchants, and on the other hand, wool merchants also hurriedly announced price increases. Yifeng announced a 30% increase, Lianxing announced a 25% increase, and Meifa, Yida, Lianyi, etc., also announced separate price increases of 20% for new spring samples. Although the surface appeared tense and panicked, business actually improved greatly compared to the previous day, with daily transaction figures exceeding 10,000 yuan between the 2nd and 4th.

In the past few days, several Italian ships arriving from Europe have brought in a lot of wool yardage, such as panpiqu, fan'erding, ma jiaobu, and various thin summer wool fabrics. Suddenly, the entire wool market, which had been filled with simple old goods, was given a fresh look. This should have been a time of increasingly frequent wholesale transactions, but the black market exchange rate in Shanghai suddenly turned, first gradually easing, and then as yarn, flowers, gold, etc., gradually fell back, all parties seemed to unanimously hope that the wool market price would ease. However, no matter how eager the hope was, the market price remained firm and expensive, without any signs of easing. Inquiries with industry insiders revealed that the European war is only expanding, and transportation of European goods will become more difficult in the future, with no increase. If Italy declares war, wool will almost disappear from the Far East. It is difficult to expect prices to fall.

Currently, general market prices are as follows: American Sijigen requires around 30 yuan per yard, and ordinary panpiqu generally costs more than 30 yuan per yard. Fan'erding is nearly 40 yuan per yard, and single-width majiaobu is around 20 yuan per yard, generally five or six times higher than the same period last year, which can be said to be dramatic.

### Water Ghost

South of the Red Bridge outside Xumen, a boatman named Jia, nicknamed "Water Ghost," was so named because he was good at swimming. On the 20th of last month, due to the continuous spring rain, the river suddenly flooded, and the fish in the harbor were submerged by the water. Jia took off his clothes and entered the water to arrange things, but he had just gone into the water when he suddenly jumped up, looking embarrassed and hesitant, appearing quite frightened. When asked the reason, he said that there was a ghost haunting the place, with immense power, difficult to fight against. After getting up, people gave him wine to calm his nerves and mocked him, saying, "I have heard of people being afraid of ghosts, but I have never heard of ghosts being afraid of ghosts. Your name is Water Ghost, but you are afraid of the ghost in the water. That is not living up to your name, and you will be laughed at not only by people but also by ghosts." At that time, someone was already drunk. Hearing this, he suddenly got up and jumped into the water. The boat was afraid of accidents, and they quickly followed him, but there was no trace of either of them. The next day, someone's body was found in the position of the fish , with the eyes, ears, mouth, and nose all blocked with mud.

### Gas Lamp Leaks

At 10 o'clock on the fifth night, the Jin Guixuan Theater was performing a drama when the gas lamp at the second entrance suddenly dimmed and brightened. It was found that the iron pipe was cracked, and the gas company was immediately notified to repair it and the main gas valve was closed. After that, nothing happened, but at that time, the audience was already panic-stricken.

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### The Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation of the Dutch

— Tong Dai

The Netherlands, this low-lying country, has now fallen due to the German invasion. Here, what I want to talk about is the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of the Dutch. Because the customs of the Dutch in these aspects are different from those of other countries.

Clothing: The clothing of Dutch farmers and fishermen varies greatly depending on the region. The world-famous old-fashioned Dutch clothing, such as wooden shoes, big-legged trousers, laced aprons, wind hoods with high fronts, and small hats with upturned sides, can often be seen in the coastal provinces, especially on the islands. However, after the war, even the young people in those places have a tendency to reject the national-style clothing.

Food: The coastal areas of the Netherlands have fertile land in the farms and produce a lot of products, so the Dutch can't eat all the sugarcane, sweet potatoes, and beans. Because cattle farming is quite developed in the Netherlands, butter and cheese are produced in large quantities every year and have become common foods for the Dutch. Fresh or canned milk can be bought everywhere. Poultry is also quite abundant. In short, the Dutch people are very comfortable in terms of food. There is an annual banquet held on a fixed date. On that day, it is even more lively, and everyone will eat a big meal!

Housing: Although the Netherlands does not produce stone materials, it has built many solemn and magnificent houses and other buildings. The capital, The Hague, has elegant scenery and a bureaucratic atmosphere. The streets are wide, the waterways are crisscrossed, and the royal palace, parliament, and government are all located there. There are also many wealthy residences. Amsterdam is the most internationally styled city in the Netherlands, and new modern buildings can be seen everywhere. The large shipyard in this place is very famous. The Dutch nation has three components: the Frisians living in the coastal provinces, the Saxons living in the east, and the Franks living in the south, each with slightly different characteristics.

Transportation: Transportation in the Netherlands, whether by water or land, is very convenient, especially the industry, which is quite developed. Modern means of transportation, such as ships, trains, and cars, can be seen everywhere. What is particularly noteworthy is that bicycles can be seen everywhere. The Wenningen seaside resort, three miles from The Hague, is a famous place in Europe, with neat, tree-lined avenues leading to The Hague. However, Rotterdam, the first commercial city, has streets that are not very clean, and compared with Amsterdam, it is far behind and has a Dutch style.

### Improvement of Men's Summer Clothing

— Er Dong

Recently, the Youth Association issued a notice soliciting improved styles of men's summer clothing. The reason is that women's clothing all over the world is light and comfortable, while men wear suits with stiff collars, and Chinese men wear long robes that drag on the ground. These are extremely unsuitable for summer wear. Therefore, there is this proposal. The principles are: comfort, beauty, elegance, and economy. The procedure is: draw a new clothing design, with address and phone number, and submit it to the Qunyubu of the Youth Association before June 30th. The department will adopt the design and award prizes.

Indeed, existing summer clothing is extremely cumbersome to wear, especially when going out for social occasions. Wearing a suit or Chinese attire is undoubtedly extremely uncomfortable, but it is unavoidable. In the past, some people advocated a movement to shorten long robes, but it was unsuccessful and soon became silent. This time, the Youth Association has come out with a proposal. If there is a perfect style, it will be easier to see results. We sincerely place our hopes on it.

Let's examine the four principles: economy should be the first priority, so that it can indirectly reduce the difficulty for poor scholars to prepare expensive silk clothes, while at the same time not harming their appearance. A suit costs at least dozens of yuan, and the situation is the same. As for comfort, it should be based on spaciousness. I think beauty and elegance should be said in reverse, as long as it is not ugly.

However, men's clothing has rarely changed, so this improvement will be very difficult. This depends on the efforts of the promoters, and the style that is agreeable to the public depends on how well it is designed.

### The Great Xu Garden

— A Letter from Willow Seed Village, Holland

I wish you could transform into countless incarnations, radiating light on "clothing, food, housing, and transportation."

Three lifetimes of quiet grass dreaming of Hangzhou. Playing as immortals, butterflies with Zhuang Zhou. Dew-covered trees in the Cold Food Festival, weeping tears. Suddenly, teaching green to fill all of Western Europe. (Xu Garden passed away in the drizzle of March 24th, the twenty-ninth year of the Republic, and old friend Shou Juan went to see him off. The news reached Western Europe, and the flowers and trees in the courtyard, just touched by the green of the overnight rain, felt it ten thousand miles away, responding like an echo.) Zipi's wealth was said to be unmatched. Chen Shuo's literary talent excelled in foreign studies. Science as the soul, art as the bones. New opportunities bloom like strange flowers in the sea. (The Invincible brand tooth powder and cosmetics produced by the family industry society, striving to protect rights and interests, are praised far and wide. The scientific papers specially written on clothing, food, housing, and transportation possess people with exquisite and insightful artistic talent.)

Together with Guan Zhong and Yi Ya, they were passed down. Clouds and rosy clouds crossing the sea, extraordinary talent. Cities, landscapes, the abode of Ding Ling. When will you return, transformed into a crane, writing poetry? (Tian Xu, I, born traveling in Yunnan, composed four poems expressing feelings and responding to his son, with the line "Wading into gardens, I willingly enter dreams.") This journey may lead to Pan Lanshi. In the next life, become another Thomas Edison. Let's wait and see China emulate France and America. Crab-walking script reciting the name of Xu Garden. (French and English are both written horizontally, and "crab-walking script," if translated into English derived from Latin, can be called CancerScript). Thanks to Mr. Shou Juan's invitation to a feast, I had the opportunity in December of the fourteenth year of the Republic to catch a glimpse of Xu Garden's demeanor. (Xu Garden recorded this event, which appeared in the Shanghai Pictorial on December 6th of that year.) Xu Garden's wit and charm were somewhat similar to Mr. Zhou Bonian, the former supervisor of the World Society before the founding of the Republic. The two men were of similar age and came from similar backgrounds, and both held positions in Shanghai as cultural pioneers. A feeling of empathy naturally arose. Xu Garden's planning was meticulous and his experience was extensive. He first created the Cuili Company in Baoshu Fang in Hangzhou, where culture was flourishing, setting a precedent for our cultural men's national goods enterprise. He also joined forces with Pan Lanshi and others, lyricists from Guilin and the sea, to publish magazines that explored literature and art. Amidst laughter and music, peach and plum trees filled his courtyard, and looking at him was like seeing an immortal. However, his ambition ultimately lay in seclusion and introspection, regretting that he never presided over the forum of a world-class city. He traveled back and forth between Shanghai and Hangzhou many times, and when his ambitions finally succeeded and his skills flourished over the years, those who loved him were even more delighted. Therefore, I say that Xu Garden's struggling journey, in our revitalizing China, should be emulated by countless young people seeking a way out. Indeed, China's greatest problems are the three major diseases of poverty, ignorance, and weakness. Summarizing Xu Garden's life, there are three noteworthy characteristics. He was able to revitalize industry to alleviate poverty, first. He was able to pursue science to cure ignorance, second. He was proficient in poetry and prose, and like Dongfang Shuo, he had a broad knowledge of foreign books. All of his writings were able to fully express the "three-dimensional" nature and powerful characteristics of Chinese characters, surpassing the young people who mistakenly treated Chinese as a foreign language and only knew how to draw out "long hemp threads." He, who did not know foreign languages, was able to demonstrate the value of science with such skill, never showing weakness, third.

In the past, during the great chaos of the Five Dynasties, someone looked up to a dog and silently prayed, saying, "I wish for a sage to be born soon." Today, China suffers from poverty, ignorance, and weak will and ability. If someone considers the rise and prosperity of the country's future, they will surely say, "I wish Heaven would give birth to countless more like Xu Garden, to advance the promotion of saving the country through science." The most important thing about a country's talent is to avoid gold being concentrated in one corner, unable to spread far and evenly. The sixteen-character motto of guidance and education for the two-poem singing guest Chen Lifu, namely "self-confidence and belief, self-governance and management, self-nurturing and nurturing others, self-defense and defending the country," can only be achieved if people in the field each live according to Xu Garden's mandate, so that the court and the field can cooperate and complement each other. Zhejiang has two Chens, and their principles are the same.

Moreover, I have often read the histories, reports, and annals of advanced countries. Western writers cannot avoid bias in their appreciation of famous figures, ancient and modern. At the extreme, they would say, "Powerful countries have people, while outside of powerful countries, there are mostly no people." One day, when China strengthens itself and eliminates the three major diseases of poverty, ignorance, and weakness, then Xu Garden's name will not only be written in crab-walking script and valued by foreign historians, but he will also transform into countless incarnations, spreading throughout the country, like Edison across the Pacific Ocean, rising to illuminate modern science.

What is even more remarkable is that I heard that Xu Garden was able to predict his own death at 10:00 AM. This is truly a unique event in the history of science, and should be explained from a scientific perspective. Today's Western medical experts, based on statistics, deeply believe that the time and season of death can be predicted like a barometer. Dr. F. Nettesheim's theory differs slightly from others, stating that the most dangerous time for a person to die is the first hour after midnight. (i.e., the beginning of Zi Zheng and Chou in Chinese time). The next most dangerous time is from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. (Yi Zheng until Wei Chu). The third most dangerous time is from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM. (from You Chu to Xu Zheng). Conversely, one hour before these dangerous times is the safest time with the fewest deaths. Xu Garden's passing, unfortunately coinciding with the predicted 10:00 AM, and my nostalgic poem from the sixteenth year, "Clouds dreary, wind dark at 1:00 PM," are both coincidences with the law of the next most dangerous time. Furthermore, according to Dr. Luo An's estimation, December and January in the Gregorian calendar are the most dangerous seasons for deaths in European countries. Conversely, April, June, and September are the three months with the fewest deaths. However, examining the world's weather, conditions vary greatly from place to place. The humidity of the earth's atmosphere most significantly affects the weather, and the weather can thereby increase or decrease diseases and deaths. The ancients' so-called miasma, dismissed as absurd by microbiologists, is now gradually seen to be reliable and evident when comparing statistics of diseases and deaths. However, the old Chinese saying that deaths are most numerous in the seven days, three days before and four days after the twenty-four solar terms, remains a mystery that science has yet to unravel. Recently, [someone]'s passing occurred four days after the Spring Equinox, coincidentally aligning with the Chinese saying. It is a pity that the wise man has passed away, and I cannot share [this understanding] with him, discussing this matter together.

Attached is Ms. Gu Qingyao's poem mourning her teacher, Xu Garden:

The mountain collapses, the tree decays, writing mournful words. Crying aloud, losing my respected teacher at the bedroom door. His surviving writings are worthy of being passed down like the Nine Tripod Cauldrons. His established words are revered like the Tai Qiu Stele. Trying to surpass Yang Ming's learning of a generation, (The teacher's "New Explanation of the Great Learning" sought to criticize Zhu Zi by examining bamboo like Yang Ming. In fact, without sincerely seeking knowledge, one cannot investigate the principles of things.) Faintly like Bai Juyi writing poetry in his later years. Knowing the "Book of Changes," one should know there is no regret. Passing on the torch, his children and grandchildren have virtuous heirs. Wearing white mourning clothes like snow, expressing heartfelt grief. Shedding tears, three thousand disciples walk in mourning. Upright qi exists between heaven and earth. The landscape will sense the vicissitudes of life from now on. A master of the literary world, respecting the teacher's model. A national defense, his industrial achievements have fallen. It is difficult to recall the events of the past with wine and music. The spring lanterns and literary games at the high hall. Not lamenting the unicorn's misfortune or resenting the poverty of the Way. Compiling annals is even better than Du Fu. Creating deep and great achievements that are also reorganizing. After the cataclysm, the family garden is half-abandoned. Few people in this chaotic world are like Tao Yuanming. His unwavering heart can be compared to Zhuang Zhou throughout the ages. The dragon has left the tripod, leaving the bow behind. Sorrowfully remembering the rain of enlightenment in those years. Twenty years of deleted drafts, treasures in the box. Personally bearing the scarlet curtain, bestowed with fine wine. Asking about characters, he strictly taught the details of prosody. Discussing poetry, he especially permitted the truth of the soul. Having experienced separation and chaos, compiling new grass, (The teacher recently compiled "Grass Amidst Separation and Chaos" for publication.) Awakening to emptiness, opening up the dust of the cataclysm. (The teacher foretold his departure from the world at 10:00 AM to his family in the morning of his passing.) Leaving behind a ten-thousand-mile pen south of the sky. Rarely recording sorrow and hardship with a broad mind.

### Economic Menu for a Week

— Ms. Hua Ying

Don't say that the prices of meat dishes like chicken, duck, and fish have skyrocketed: even the vegetables these days are exceptionally expensive, truly leading to a trend where people only eat white rice without vegetables. Look at the most ordinary water spinach, costing as much as 30 cents per pound, amaranth has been on the market for a long time, and it still costs 20 cents per pound, broad beans, although only cost 8 cents per pound, are in pods, taking up half the weight, and cannot be considered cheap. The relatively cheap option is cabbage at 12 cents per pound. My family originally loves to eat cabbage, so we eat cabbage three or four days a week. For meat dishes, stir-fry with sliced or diced pork, sometimes chopping the pork and using large cabbage leaves to wrap it like a quilt to eat. For vegetarian dishes, either stir-fry alone or add bamboo shoots, shiitake mushrooms, wheat gluten, sweet potatoes, etc., to make vegetarian "Ten Delights." In short, living is difficult these days, so we can only choose relatively cheap things to eat.

Monday

Cabbage with Sliced Pork, Sweet and Sour Mandarin Fish, Diced Broad Beans, Tofu with Chinese Toon

Tuesday

Celery Beef, Yellow Croaker with Vegetables, Pan-fried Tofu with Vegetables, Stir-fried Water Spinach

Wednesday

Stir-fried Shredded Pork, Clear Stewed Carp Soup, Braised Vegetarian Ten Delights, Stinky Tofu

Thursday

Tomato Beef Soup, Braised Small Carp, Yellow Bean Sprouts with Cabbage, Stir-fried Cellophane Noodles with Vegetables

Friday

Cabbage Wrapped Pork, Sweet and Sour Fried Hairtail, Celery and Bean Sprouts, Stir-fried Wheat Gluten with Seaweed

Saturday

Fermented Bean Curd Braised Beef, Braised Fresh Carp, Scallion Crab Red Bean Paste, Mugwort Braised Tofu

Sunday

### The Plague of Bedbugs

— Yun

Bedbugs suck human blood and disturb peace, causing sleepless nights, leading to mental exhaustion, affecting health and daytime work. This is a major threat to the lives of the general public—especially the working masses—during the summer. Methods to eliminate bedbugs, such as pyrethrum powder, injecting kerosene or gasoline or stinky liquid, or injecting other water-like insecticidal liquids, are only effective in treating the symptoms. The effective range is limited to the moment when the bedbug touches the powder or liquid. The ideal method of eradicating bedbugs should focus on complete extermination. Recently, the "Climb Not Bedbug Self-Extermination Powder," which is popular on the market, only requires a small amount of powder to be poured into a paper bag and placed on the four corners of the bed before going to bed, which can attract bedbugs and cause them to die on their own, just like a bug-catching lamp that attracts moths to the fire, causing the bugs to come on their own and die on their own. It saves time and labor. Moreover, "Climb Not Bedbug Powder" can be used continuously, gradually reducing bedbugs and eventually achieving the effect of complete eradication. It is truly a pesticide with perfect efficacy.

Spring and Autumn

### Before Summer Vacation: Difficulty in Further Education, Greater Difficulty in Employment, Difficulty in Studying, Even Greater Difficulty in Graduating

— Ren Ming

It is not easy to be a middle school student for six years. Parents have put in a lot of effort, paying tuition for twelve semesters, and one has also studied diligently under the window for six years, enduring all kinds of hardships, and finally made it to graduation.

Graduation, in this day and age, is not something to be optimistic about. The future prospects are very uncertain, further education is difficult, and employment is even more difficult. However, these are problems after graduation. Who knew that the exams have not yet been held, and seeing the notices from the academic affairs office and the student union these days, I realized that there is still a hurdle to overcome before graduating, which is a large sum of money.

At a time when the cost of living is rising daily, the cost of books and stationery is already difficult to bear. Now, at the time of graduation, it is even more impossible to raise this sum of money temporarily, and the use of this money does not have much value. However, because it is stipulated by the school authorities and the student union, although one does not agree, one cannot violate the whole, so it has become an indispensable expense!

The estimated amount is at least forty dollars, and the items for payment are as follows:

Regulations from the school side: (1) Pay a graduation certificate fee of five yuan; (2) Four semi-body photos (need to take half a dozen two-inch photos)

Regulations from the student union side: (1) Eight yuan for a farewell dinner; (2) Five yuan for the graduation yearbook (this is a beautifully printed booklet, the content of which, in addition to inscriptions from teachers, is to select a better article from each person's composition book for publication. Now that printing costs have risen, five dollars is not enough, and I am afraid we will have to pay another one or two yuan); (3) Two yuan for group photos; (4) Three yuan for the graduation souvenir ring; (5) Three cents for the directory of all teachers and students (originally intended to be attached to the yearbook, but because it took up too much space, fearing that it would increase paper and printing costs, it was changed to a mimeographed booklet); (6) Graduating students should jointly send a souvenir to the alma mater as a permanent memento (no purchase has been made yet, but five yuan has been collected temporarily)

In private, some students are exchanging photos and giving souvenirs, which, of course, I am also a part of, and it is difficult to refuse. In addition, there are students going to the interior, and everyone has to send them off.

Some people think that this expense is nothing, and besides, graduation is a major event, rarely encountered in a lifetime, and it is worth spending a few dollars to commemorate it. However, for students from poorer families, the expenses for each semester are budgeted and cannot be overspent. This expense is unexpected, and of course it is difficult to take out the money.

Everyone laments that education is built on money. To enter the gates of school, one must have money, but even when graduating, to get a diploma and leave school, one still needs money. "Studying is difficult," but who would have thought that "graduation is difficult too!"

### Graduation Fees

— Mao Chun

I have a younger brother who is studying at a certain primary school in Wangjiesha Garden on Carter Road in this city. This semester is his sixth grade, and he will graduate before this summer vacation.

Today he ran home and asked his father for seven dollars, and his father asked him what it was for. He said it was a "graduation fee."

His father had rarely heard of "graduation" requiring a "fee" and thought his younger brother was lying, so he borrowed a telephone and called the school to inquire. The principal in the school personally listened to the phone and told his father very frankly that it was true, and the reason was very simple: "Paper prices are soaring, there are many graduating students, and the school cannot afford the graduation certificates. Therefore, to graduate, one must pay a graduation fee."

After his father returned home, he was very angry, but finally opened the trunk and reluctantly took out seven dollars to give to his younger brother. But I am very skeptical, does a graduation diploma really require seven dollars? Have paper prices really risen to this point?

To be honest, the school must also know this. They are taking advantage of the difficulty of graduating to try to rip off the students, so they are even demanding an amount that is almost the same as tuition. I think there must be many schools in Shanghai that "set up various pretexts" to collect fees. I hope that people with a sense of justice in society will come out and punish them together!

### The Way to Hygiene

— A Certain Person

Summer has just begun, and people living in pigeon lofts are already feeling the heat. In a few more weeks, they will naturally have to copy old articles, carry broken mats, and sleep on the streets again. Seeing the air-conditioning equipment in tall buildings, with fans running non-stop, is of course endlessly enviable. Even passing by the door of an ice cream shop, one can't help but salivate.

But being envious is useless. It is still important to pay attention to one's own hygiene within the possible range. The lives of the poor are not worth much, but excessive enjoyment is not necessarily happiness.

Air-conditioning equipment and fans running non-stop are indeed comfortable to live in, but the outdoor climate cannot be changed. This disparity between cold and heat often makes it easy to encounter the invasion of terrible diseases when going in and out. At the same time, according to doctors, it is necessary to sweat in the summer, otherwise the body will not be smooth, and cold drinks stimulate the stomach, which is also harmful and unprofitable. This is not Ah Q's "You are my son," just as we have a healthy body, why envy those expensive tonics.

The most important condition in summer is to pay attention to diet. The "Do not eat unclean things, do not drink unboiled water" that is often seen on electric poles truly encompasses the way to hygiene in the summer.

Don't be envious of the rich's enjoyment, just pay attention to your own health. If you unfortunately get sick, the lives of the poor are not worth much.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianqing

Chapter 24: Lakes and Mountains Each Have Their Own Charms, Scholars and Ladies Joyfully Call Out "Long Live" Together

On this day, Jin Danyang and Mrs. Su Liya discussed opening two family touring cars to go to Freedom Village. The reason was that many people from Shanghai wanted to visit Freedom Village. One part was Lin Jiancheng, Jin Danyang's friend, and even the architect who built the factory building for the He family's two young ladies was also included. One part was Mrs. Su Liya's friends, and there were also several, all of whom had lived in China for a long time and had a close friendship with the Chinese. Originally, because of the rain, many people were hesitant, but now that they saw that the atmosphere was clear, everyone wanted to go. There was also Mr. Jiang Jingrong, who, for the He family's young ladies' silk factory, had the groundbreaking ceremony on that day, and the two young ladies insisted on inviting Elder Jiang to the scene, so he also hitched a ride in the family touring car. This car went straight to Freedom Village, without stopping along the way. As for Wu Junsu and her party, they went directly from Suzhou. Lao Zhang the doctor and his party went directly from Anle Town, which was very convenient. Zhu Airen had arrived at Freedom Village the day before, helping her grandfather and mother manage everything. Fortunately, there were many people in the countryside who could handle things, and it was easy with everyone's help, so Village Chief Zhu did not have to work very hard. There was also one more thing, the He family's young ladies had written a letter to Zhu Airen two days earlier. That was to have them take care of the lunch on that day, because that day was the groundbreaking ceremony for their silk factory, and they should treat their guests. However, the place had to borrow the village hall. Their factory, as well as their residence, were being built in Freedom Village, and they were now all members of the village. However, on that day, because there were foreign guests in attendance, the dishes seemed to have to be better prepared, and I was afraid that no one in Freedom Village could handle such a large banquet. But Zhu Airen said: There is no need to worry about this, Freedom Village is not far from Suzhou, and when the time comes, hire a kitchen to handle it here. But you have to prepare how many guests, so that they can prepare. The He family's young ladies said that 300 guests would be enough, right? They were preparing to feast the guests and the people of Freedom Village on this day. Zhu Airen said: No matter what, we won't need 300 guests, half that number, 150 guests should be enough. Zhu Airen was always planning to be thrifty and did not want to waste a single bit. She hired a kitchen in advance to handle it properly. The place for the banquet was also discussed and arranged with her grandfather. When tomorrow came, many people had already gotten up at the break of dawn. The first major thing to do was to see what the weather was like today. At first, it still felt a bit hazy with morning mist, but gradually a round red sun broke through the clouds, and the overnight mist was completely cleared, illuminating the earth. At that time, there was a burst of cheers, and everyone said: "Today is a good day! Not only is everyone's spirits lifted, but even all the flowers and trees have been revitalized. (287)

### Pen, Ink, Paper

— Qiang Gong

I wrote this topic, meaning that I want to advocate for domestic products in front of people who use pen, ink, and paper. The consumption of these things nationwide—especially in Shanghai—is truly considerable.

Most of the pens, ink, and paper used daily are foreign goods. Nowadays, prices are expensive for everything, and of course pens, ink, and paper cannot be exceptions. Therefore, switching to Chinese pens, ink, and paper, even if the price cannot be much cheaper, at least the rights and interests will not flow out.

Now schools and businesses almost all use fountain pens, foreign ink, and foreign paper. If they can switch to using brushes and Chinese paper, then it will also be a small supplement to the increase in national power.

Our country has always used brushes to write formal documents, and the documents used by government agencies are also written with brushes on Chinese paper. However, at present, elementary, middle, and universities use fountain pens to write on foreign paper for their homework. Therefore, once out of school, they simply cannot hold a brush to write documents, which seems a bit contradictory.

Writing the same text, expressing the same meaning, why not use a brush but a fountain pen? This is probably due to the trend. A fountain pen represents being well-versed in both Chinese and Western learning. Even if you cannot be well-versed in both Chinese and Western learning, you must be able to hang it on your clothes to show "登樣一." In terms of appearance, fountain pens are certainly more "fashionable," but in terms of practical application or when you leave school in the future, brushes will be difficult for you everywhere. I hope that the current students in universities, middle schools, and elementary schools can also pay a little attention to brushes, Chinese paper, ink, and other items.

This article does not have any exaggerated praise for Chinese pens, ink, and paper. However, in fact, brushes and other items are still everywhere in Chinese society. Because modern young students have too neglected these things, which they will still have to use in the future and regard as good friends, I have made some casual comments about them.

### Take It or Leave It

— Locke

Ten years ago, according to a bookstore owner, booksellers should aim for middle school students; because elementary school students do not yet know the importance of reading, university students love to go to dance halls to play and do not want to read, only middle school students are really reading.

Now, according to an educator, university students go to dance halls, and many middle school students are also going to dance halls. There are also a large number of people in movie theaters, and even more are taking advantage of the fact that most of the schools on the current isolated island do not have physical education and are going to ice skating rinks. They, like university students, do not want to read, only elementary school students are really reading.

### From Fear to Courage

What we need today is courage, and what our daily life demands is also courage. A person born in this era, if without the mental and spiritual power, can never cope with the difficulties of life. Perhaps you have talent and learning, but without courage, your achievements will be very limited. If you cannot discover the source of courage in your own life, you will feel that your thoughts and talents are useless. How many people today, in disappointment and despair, say to themselves, "It's useless, useless, this kind of battle is not worth fighting for us, public opinion is too opposed to us, we lack the main force required by life." Behind this attitude are countless kinds of fears. From our childhood, these kinds of fears have only increased and expanded. When we were children, we were afraid of the dark, afraid of strong classmates bigger than us, afraid of failing homework and exams. A little older, the fear is even greater. Some people fear that their social status and economy will be in danger. Some fathers fear that they will not be able to maintain the lives of their families. Some young men and women want to get married, but they don't know how to manage economically. We are surrounded by all kinds of fears. Material fears, such as having no money to spend, fearing unemployment, etc. In short, in daily life, no one does not experience fear, and what is the result? Mental decay, feeling full of pain, panic, and failure. Our fears hinder our progress and block our talents. In despair, we shout loudly, "Who can save us from this body of death?" What people need is to get rid of fear and overcome all the boredom that corrupts personality. There is a great prophet in the Bible who teaches us courage. His words were originally spoken to the exiled Hebrews, who were cruelly exiled from their homeland by other nations to foreign countries with different cultures and religions to be prisoners, serving their masters. They were originally a nation of great courage, who had discovered the secret of faith that gave them strength, comfort, and power. (To be continued) For detailed study, please write to P.O.
