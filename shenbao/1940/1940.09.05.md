### Vietnamese Governor-General Assures China: No Japanese Troops Allowed to Pass Through to Invade Yunnan; Hong Kong Reports Japanese Troops Preparing to Land in Vietnam Tomorrow; Vietnamese and Chinese Governments Have Agreed on Response Measures

Hong Kong: According to sources from Chinese in Kwangchow Bay, the Japanese fleet is currently cruising off the coast of Vietnam, blockading the entire northeast coast. Haiphong has become an active center. French and indigenous troops are being deployed to defend key coastal points. The French authorities are preparing to evacuate French women and children from coastal towns. The French authorities have imposed strict censorship on telegrams. Furthermore, according to Chinese sources, the Vietnamese authorities have agreed with the Chongqing government on a plan to be adopted in the event of a Vietnamese invasion. It is reported that Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux has assured Chongqing that, under no circumstances, will Japanese armed forces be allowed to pass through Vietnam to invade Yunnan, nor will Japan be allowed to establish a base in Vietnam.

Hong Kong: According to information received here from well-informed sources, the Japanese ultimatum demanding permission for troops to pass through Vietnam has now been withdrawn. It is reported that discussions between the French authorities and the Japanese inspection team are continuing today in Hanoi. However, the tension caused by the French rejection of the Japanese demand remains acute. Last night, Saigon radio announced the temporary suspension of scheduled railway services. According to a reliable observer who arrived in Hong Kong from Vietnam yesterday, the Japanese had previously notified the Vietnamese authorities that Japanese troops would land there on Friday, September 6th. The leader of the Japanese inspection team in Vietnam, Nishihara, informed the Vietnamese government that, after the unsatisfactory response from Vichy regarding Japan's demands, Japan must take the initiative in landing troops. This action would be tantamount to an invasion. According to sources from Chinese in Kwangchow Bay, Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux has agreed with the Chinese government on measures to be taken by the Chinese and French authorities in the event of such an invasion.

Rangoon: The Vietnamese French authorities and Japanese representatives resumed negotiations in Hanoi today. It is reported that the chairman of the Japanese delegation, General Nishihara, has not insisted that Vietnam accept the terms of the Japanese ultimatum. According to a Saigon communiqué issued yesterday, Japan presented an ultimatum on Sunday demanding permission for Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam, which the Vietnamese French authorities rejected. Subsequently, dispatches from Hong Kong reported that Japanese troops were preparing to land in Vietnam on September 6th. (Reuters, 4th)

Hong Kong: It is reported that Japan is now preparing to send troops to land in Vietnam on September 6th. According to news obtained from travelers arriving here today, the head of the Japanese mission sent to Vietnam, General Nishihara, has notified the Vietnamese government that, after receiving an unsatisfactory response from Vichy regarding Japan's demands, Japan has decided to take preliminary action on September 6th by sending troops to land. According to a Saigon official gazette published yesterday, Japan presented an ultimatum on the 1st of this month demanding permission for Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam, which has been rejected by the Vietnamese French authorities. (Reuters, 4th)

Chongqing: This morning, all newspapers prominently published the official announcement that Japan has presented Vietnam with an ultimatum demanding that troops be allowed to pass through. All Chinese are eagerly awaiting further developments. It is recalled that Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui issued a declaration on August 28th stating that if Japanese troops landed in Vietnam, the Chinese authorities were determined to take defensive measures and send troops into Vietnam. At the time, as there were no reports of extraordinary developments, this declaration caused some surprise. However, in order to clarify China's attitude towards a possible Japanese invasion of Vietnam, China decided to issue this declaration. The only Chinese news regarding the Japanese-Vietnamese negotiations stated that the Vietnamese authorities agreed to supply Japan with rice, coal, rubber, and other raw materials, but demanded in exchange the restoration of French railway transport and a guarantee that Japan would not take any military action in Vietnam. It is reported that Japan had proposed several conditions before agreeing to restore railway commercial freight, which are currently under discussion. Since the news of the Japanese ultimatum has been confirmed, the situation in Vietnam has completely changed. People here are concerned that if Japan invades Vietnam, the war may quickly spread to the South China Sea. Although the Chinese authorities hope that the outcome of this ultimatum will not lead to war between Japan and Vietnam, they believe that a peaceful resolution is unlikely, as the issue is now beyond the control of the Vietnamese authorities. It is believed here that if Vietnam allows Japanese troops to pass through, Chinese troops will enter Vietnam to defend the border. However, on the other hand, if Vietnam rejects Japan's demands, Japanese troops will land on September 6th. At that time, regardless of what decision the Vietnamese authorities make, war within Vietnam will be difficult to avoid. Details of China's plans to deal with the situation have not yet been announced, but it is reported that the Supreme Command has long since completed preparations. Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin recently flew to Yunnan Province to confer with the provincial chairman, Long Yun, regarding the military measures to be taken in the event of a Japanese invasion of Vietnam. (Reuters, 4th)

The Franco-Japanese Negotiations Have Not Reached a Breaking Point

Saigon: After the Vietnamese French authorities rejected the Japanese demand to allow troops to pass through Vietnam, the entire situation in Vietnam suddenly became tense. Due to strict censorship, it is impossible to ascertain the current situation accurately, or what events will occur in the near future. However, it seems that a breaking point has not yet been reached, because although the Japanese demand has been openly rejected, negotiations between the two sides are still proceeding in a superficially friendly and reasonable manner. Nishihara is still in Vietnam. (Reuters, 4th)

Vichy: A semi-official French source quoted a responsible document as saying that negotiations between the French and Japanese governments regarding their respective interests in the Far East have continued for some time and have not been interrupted. (Reuters, 4th)

Vichy: Responsible sources here have recently confirmed that the French and Japanese governments are continuing negotiations regarding their respective interests in the Far East. Rumors from foreign sources that the negotiations have been interrupted are untrue. (Havas, 4th)

Japan Denies Issuing Ultimatum to Vietnam

Tokyo: The Japanese Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy recently stated that they had no knowledge of the news reported from Saigon that Japan had sent an ultimatum demanding passage through Vietnam to invade Yunnan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that negotiations between the Japanese delegation in Hanoi and the French authorities were still in progress and had made some progress, but had not yet been completed. Furthermore, French sources here stated that, to their knowledge, the situation had not changed. (Associated Press, 4th)

Tokyo: The Army Department today denied rumors that Japan had presented Vietnam with an ultimatum demanding that Japanese troops pass through Vietnam. A spokesman for the Army Department stated that Japan is currently conducting negotiations with the Vichy government of Pétain regarding various issues related to Vietnam. The fact that the news of this Japanese ultimatum originated in London shows Britain's concern about the outcome of the current Franco-Japanese negotiations. The rumor also stated that the French authorities in Vietnam had rejected Japan's demands. (Associated Press, 4th)

Tokyo: Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma stated today when meeting with newspaper reporters that, "We hope that French Indochina will be peaceful and well-governed. Various rumors to the contrary are not credible. We hope that matters can be settled amicably within a few days." He had not received any news of a rebellion in Vietnam. When asked about the negotiations between Japan and the Pétain government, the spokesman replied that the negotiations were currently in progress but had not yet reached the final stage.

### Zhou Enlai Talks to Reporters: The Entire Nation, Under the Leadership of its Leader, is Growing Stronger in Unity; Northern Warfare Has Been Unfolding for Nearly Half a Month; The Purpose is to Tie Down Japanese Military Strength

Chongqing: Zhou Enlai, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the General Headquarters, invited many Chinese reporters today to a tea party and gave a speech, stating that the entire nation, under the leadership of its leader, is becoming increasingly resolute in its determination to resist the Japanese, and that unity is becoming more and more consolidated. Regarding rumors that the Japanese army will launch a fall offensive, he observed that the Japanese army is placing its main force on the Sichuan front, which is quite possible. However, the situation from Yichang to Chongqing is different from that from Wuhu to Hankou in the past. It is necessary to have extremely large forces to encircle and outflank on both sides of the Yangtze River in order to succeed. If the Chinese army on all fronts takes a consistent offensive, tying down the Japanese army, then their attempts will inevitably be shattered. Currently, the northern war has been unfolding for nearly half a month. Traffic on the Tianjin-Pukou, Pinghan, Pingsui, Zhengtai, and Datong-Puzhou five railways and eleven highways has been cut off, especially the Zhengtai Railway. This kind of action will be long-term and planned, and its purpose is to tie down Japanese military strength so that they will not be able to prepare to cross the river, let alone draw troops south. (Havas, 5th)

Editorial

### Ideals and Sacrifice

Besides the many well-known reasons for the defeat of Britain and France by Germany this summer, one point that must be pointed out is the difference in the mental state of the two sides; All the different diplomatic applications and the disparity in military mobilization should be analyzed from a mental perspective to find an accurate explanation. For the past twenty-five years, Germany's only ideal has been how to get rid of the shackles of Versailles, recover lost homeland, and realize the unity of the Germanic nation. Because of this, the German people willingly endured the severe rule of the Nazis; and the Nazi authorities, in order to express their ambitions and ideals, did not hesitate to use all means to achieve them. This situation is in stark contrast to the hesitation and wavering of Britain and France. In particular, in the past ten years, the foreign policies of Britain and France have almost completely lacked unified and consistent steps and stances; their response to Germany and Italy has been sometimes appeasement and sometimes sanctions. They lacked firm confidence in establishing a peace front, and they lacked substantial preparation for the prospects of a major war. Their people were even more accustomed to enjoying pleasure and comfort, relying on the aftermath of victory. This situation was especially true in France, so France suffered the most terrible defeat in the war. These extreme drawbacks of realistic spirit are the main reasons why Britain and France suffered disastrous defeats before.

Since France surrendered and Britain fell into a lonely struggle, the United States felt deeply stimulated, and its military build-up began to be promoted on an unprecedented scale and speed. In addition to material construction, considerable attention has also been paid to the mental aspects. In his opening speech at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park on the 2nd of this month, President Roosevelt specifically addressed the above-mentioned weaknesses and loudly appealed that those who specialize in ridiculing ideals, despising sacrifices, and are satisfied with merely satisfying their current lives are tantamount to enemies hidden in the country. Roosevelt's statement, on the one hand, was indeed a punishment for the failures of Britain and France, but on the other hand, it was also because the same weaknesses existed in the United States itself. In the United States, so-called isolationists are actually another form of realists. The mockers of ideals and despisers of sacrifices that President Roosevelt criticized are undoubtedly mainly aimed at isolationists. Although these people in the international community are not as obviously sinful as the policy of appeasement, they are also major enemies of justice and security.

Progress is an important factor for human survival, and ideals are the beacons that lead human progress, and the extinction of ideals will inevitably lead to social stagnation and even regression. However, in the process of promoting the realization of ideals, it is inevitable that a considerable price must be paid. In feudal times and religious life, ideals were supremely revered, and sacrifice was a precious virtue. Since the industrial revolution, individualism has developed along with capitalist economy. The social institutions of the old era have collapsed, and the ideology of the world has also undergone changes. As a result, money has banished ideals and creeds, enjoyment has replaced the spirit of martyrdom, and those who are addicted to ideals and justice have often become the object of ridicule. In this way, personal happiness has indeed increased to double the previous era, but the interests of the entire population have been eroded invisibly. The industrial revolution originally represented the progress of human socio-economic conditions, but only the above point is a side that can be cursed. When this phenomenon is further reflected in the political arena, it forms realism and appeasement policy. Everything is only focused on current interests, regardless of right and wrong in principle, and pursues momentary security, regardless of future interests. Over the past decade, the entire world has fallen into war and the previously established foundation of security has been completely lost. The cause and effect have been clearly demonstrated in the eyes of the people; but in fact, it has not yet been finally settled. Therefore, today, the spirit of martyrdom that is willing to sacrifice everything for the pursuit of the highest ideal has a special need to be emphasized.

It is said that the reason why ideals are often criticized and despised is nothing more than because they are empty and have no practical relevance; in fact, if that is the case, it can only be regarded as fantasy rather than ideal. The so-called ideal must have rationality and practicality, and it is definitely not an aerial castle that is formed by thinking alone. But on the other hand, all ideals must be revisions and even reforms of reality, so they will inevitably encounter resistance, and sacrifice becomes necessary. The reason why people ridicule ideals, in a word, is simply because of their fear of sacrifice. In fact, everything in the world needs to pay a considerable price. The more extravagant the hope, the greater the price. It is not only the pursuit of lofty principles that is true. If you are lazy and afraid of difficulties, and only want to gain without effort, the only future is bound to be a tragic failure or decline. The same is true for individuals and countries. The rise and fall of Germany and France has provided a very obvious example. In addition to the serious warning from the President of the United States, not only Americans, but all people and politicians in the world should learn from this. And in China, which is fighting for freedom and independence, if there are also those who covet security, fear sacrifice, and despise lofty ideals, it is hoped that they can wake up with a start.

### Epoch-Making Grand Action: US and UK Sign Naval Agreement: Exchanging Destroyers for Leases on British Territories: Strengthening Defenses without Threatening Other Countries

Washington: President Roosevelt sent a message to Congress announcing the lease of naval and air bases in British territories in the Western Hemisphere in exchange for fifty US destroyers exceeding their service life. He stated that this matter does not hinder the United States' position of not knowing war, and it is not a threat to any country. This is an epoch-making grand action in the defense preparations of the Americas in the face of a serious crisis. The preparation of defense is a privilege that no sovereign country gives up. The use of this privilege in the current environment is necessary to maintain our security. The United States has adopted a national defense plan since the Louisiana Purchase (referring to the United States' purchase of the French territory west of the Mississippi River from Napoleon), which, like today, is based on the consideration of American security and protection against foreign attacks. Today's move is the most important act of the plan. The value of the American coastal security outpost line to the Western Hemisphere is incalculable. All those responsible for regulating and organizing the sea and land defenses of the United States have long recognized the need for this outpost line, because it is necessary to protect the Panama Canal, Central and South America, and the coasts of the Antilles, Canada, and the Gulf of Mexico. Its important relationship with Western Hemisphere defense is very clear. For this reason, I am taking this opportunity to obtain it.

### US-UK Agreement Can Be Implemented Immediately, No Need to Pass Through US Congress

The President, in his message, announced the opinion of Attorney General Jackson on the President's authority to implement this agreement. According to rumors here, this agreement can be implemented immediately without the need for Congressional legislation. President Roosevelt said on his way to Washington that the main value of this naval observation base is that the United States can keep the enemy out of the door. The President declined to comment on the possibility of taking further steps in the future to acquire distant bases to protect the Western Hemisphere. When reporters asked whether the current US-UK agreement would be the prelude to the establishment of US bases in Greenland, the President replied that he believed that reporters should not publish comments that other events would originate from this. The President also said that US destroyers will be handed over to the UK in a reasonably short period of time. When reporters asked whether some destroyers were already on their way to the UK, the President replied that he did not want to say, and that he did not know where the ships were currently located. The United States cannot send the ships to the UK. The President's last statement was probably to explain that the destroyers must be sailed to the UK by British or Canadian crew members. British Prime Minister Churchill's announcement, through his ambassador to the United States, that Britain would never abandon or sink the British fleet, has prompted reporters to speculate on whether the bases now acquired by the United States could be used by British ships in the future. President Roosevelt was unwilling to discuss this, saying only that he believed that the British fleet would go wherever defense required. (Reuters, 4th)

Washington: President Roosevelt said when reporting the resale of warships to Congress that the bases in Newfoundland and Bermuda had been generously granted by Britain, and that the other bases had been exchanged for fifty destroyers. In this agreement with Britain, the United States obtained the right to lease Newfoundland, Bermuda, the Bahamas, Jamaica, St. Lucia, Antigua, and British Guiana. The lease term for the above bases is ninety-nine years. (Associated Press, 4th)

### London Announces Treaty Contents, Sends Experts to Demarcate Boundaries Immediately

London: This official site recently stated that the British-American naval treaty was signed in Washington on September 2, stipulating that 50 US destroyers would be delivered to the UK immediately, and that the UK would lease some naval and air bases in British territories off the North American coast to the United States for a period of ninety-nine years. The agreement is attached to a document stating that the British and American governments have discovered a practical method during negotiations that can materially and efficiently assist the defense needs of both parties. Reuters learned that British crew members will sail these destroyers across the Atlantic to the UK. On September 2, British Ambassador to the United States Lothian sent a public letter to US Secretary of State Hull, stating that since the British government has a basic friendship with the United States and a sympathetic concern for American security, and wants to strengthen the US government With the practical cooperation of the United States and other American countries, we can strengthen the ability to consolidate the defense of the Western Hemisphere, so we are unconstrained and have no worries. We are willing to grant the United States the right to lease. It is said that the United States will immediately establish a naval and air base on the Avalon Peninsula, the south coast of Newfoundland, and the east coast and Great Bay of Bermuda. Enjoy the convenience of entering and leaving each of these places for protection. The British government also recognizes the United States' desire to continue to acquire naval and air bases in the Caribbean Sea and in British Guiana. It allows the United States to immediately establish and enjoy a naval and air base in the eastern Bahamas, the south coast of Jamaica, the west coast of St. Lucia, the west coast of Trinidad, Ballya Bay, Antigua, and British Guiana within 50 miles of Georgetown. The British government does not want to place a monetary or transactional value on the many obvious and hidden rights and assets related to this, but wants to exchange it for the military equipment and raw materials that the United States will give to the British government. The lease term for the above bases is ninety-nine years. Except for the compensation for private landlords agreed upon by both parties, rent and other expenses are exempted. In the lease to be agreed upon by both parties, the British government is willing to allow the United States to enjoy various rights in the territorial sea and territorial scope necessary for access to and protection of the bases it leases and near these bases. The exact location and boundaries of each base will be determined through changes. The British government is ready to send experts immediately to work with American experts to handle this matter. US Secretary of State Hull gladly accepted the British proposal in his reply, and declared that the US government was willing to immediately hand over to the British government 50 US naval destroyers of what is generally called the 1,200-ton type. (Reuters, 3rd)

### US to Expand Leasing Scope, Destroyer Transfer to Begin Next Week

Charlestown: President Roosevelt hinted to the outside world yesterday that, after the establishment of this British-American agreement, there will be a future expansion of the scope of leasing, so that the number of naval and air force bases in the Western Hemisphere will be more numerous, and the defense of the United States will be strengthened. (Associated Press, 4th)

Washington: US Secretary of State Hull recently stated that the British government will receive the first batch of 50 destroyers promised to be transferred by the United States within a few days. (Associated Press, 4th)

Ottawa: The Canadian Department of National Defence recently announced that the transfer of 50 US destroyers to Britain will soon be held in various Canadian ports. (Associated Press, 4th)

Washington: The US destroyers handed over to Britain under the British-American naval treaty will be handed over immediately. According to the announcement of the US Navy Department, of the 50 destroyers, the first eight to be handed over to Britain are already in Boston and should be ready for handover next Friday. These eight will be sailed to Canada by current crew members, and then received by British crew members. Thereafter, batches of destroyers, each with eight, will be handed over successively every half month. The ships will be fully armed, such as guns, cannons, torpedo tubes, anti-aircraft guns, machine guns, etc. will be handed over. At current prices, the value of the destroyers is US$85 million. The US naval tactician Stark has proven that the transfer of US destroyers and the acquisition of defensive bases not only do not reduce but strengthen US defense. Therefore, the legal procedures required for the disposal of destroyers have now been fulfilled. US naval officer Forrestal has appointed a committee of seven to work with British experts to determine the exact location of the bases provided by Britain. (Reuters, 4th)

### Similar Negotiations Taking Place Between the US and Canada: Canada Actively Developing Military Industry

London (Reuters Dispatch) – A diplomatic correspondent for Reuters says that the establishment of the Anglo-American naval agreement is sure to garner immense satisfaction from all levels of British society. Britain will obtain the destroyers it needs for escort duty, to cope with submarines and keep shipping lanes open. The United States will gain the convenience of naval and air bases in places like the Panama Canal Zone for 99 years. This kind of lease does not infringe upon sovereignty, as the British Prime Minister has previously stated. The United States and Canada are conducting similar negotiations regarding ***[unclear text in original]***. This Anglo-American agreement can be said to achieve three primary objectives: (1) The British Navy promptly receives fresh reinforcements to carry out its mission of maintaining Atlantic traffic. (2) It aids American security, which the people of the British Empire consider extremely important. (3) It strengthens the defenses of the Western Hemisphere. This agreement is extremely important and could not have been achieved without mutual trust and goodwill from both sides. Therefore, it can be regarded as proof of democratic nations safeguarding their common interests. (Reuters, 4th)

Ottawa – The general public in Canada has expressed its pleasure with the Anglo-American naval agreement, and believes that this agreement will enable the United States to gain a clearer understanding of the problems faced by the British Empire in its war against totalitarianism. Many people in Canada say that this recent move is the best action the United States could take to aid the Allied war effort, short of sending an expeditionary force. With the United States establishing forward bases in the Western Hemisphere and forming a permanent joint defense committee to study US-Canadian joint defense, Canada, like Britain, will quickly become an impregnable fortress, able to produce war materials without obstruction and send expeditionary forces to attack Hitler's controlled territories. Canadian Minister of Munitions and Supply Howe stated today that Canada is rapidly expanding its industrial development program to meet wartime demands for guns, artillery, and materials. Soon, approximately 17.5 million dollars will be spent to build three new factories, which will begin operations next year, employing tens of thousands of people to manufacture chemicals, artillery, and rifles. (Reuters, 4th)

### Many US Legislators Express Approval

Washington – With the exception of a small number of isolationists, members of Congress have largely commented on the Anglo-American naval agreement with approval. Democratic Senator Swartz stated, "Britain is currently fighting for us, so I support giving them any assistance we can." Senator Minton stated, "This agreement not only helps Britain but also gives us the bases we desperately need." Senator Barkley stated that the Anglo-American agreement does not require Congressional approval and anticipates that the public will fully support this approach. Isolationist Senator Nye, referring to the opinion expressed by the Attorney General that Congressional legislation is not required for passage, stated that American leaders are gradually adopting dictatorial practices, disregarding laws and treaties in the name of urgency. Senator Clark stated that the transfer of destroyers is tantamount to an act of war. Congressman Waizwei stated that while Congress acknowledges the value of the new bases, it will not allow the transfer of destroyers. Other isolationist legislators have all criticized President Roosevelt for failing to consult with Congress beforehand. (Reuters, 4th)

### British Government to Make a Statement

London – A Reuters correspondent in the Parliamentary lobbies states that the government will make a statement on the Anglo-American naval agreement in both Houses tomorrow. It is expected that there will be lengthy statements in the House of Commons, emphasizing the historically significant meaning of the goodwill between the two countries. This will likely be followed by a brief debate, with prominent members possibly making critical remarks about the agreement and other war-related events. (Reuters, 4th)

London – First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander recently made a statement expressing his delight and satisfaction with the agreement under which Britain will acquire fifty destroyers from the United States, stating that these warships will be of immense value in escorting convoys and protecting our coasts against invasion at a time when our destroyers are insufficient. (Reuters, 4th)

London – Today, all British newspapers praised the Anglo-American naval agreement as the most welcome development in the war. The newspapers emphasized that the transfer of destroyers to Britain by the United States not only represents a significant increase in British strength but also signifies the extent to which the United States is assisting. (Reuters, 4th)

### German and Italian Criticism and Ridicule of Britain

Berlin – A spokesperson for the German Foreign Ministry stated today that regarding the sale of fifty destroyers from the United States to Britain, Britain is sacrificing its valuable land in exchange for outdated warships.

(Reuters, 4th)

Milan – Italian newspapers today all published articles commenting on the Anglo-American agreement, making every effort to ridicule it. The *Sera* newspaper stated that this new agreement can be seen as convincing evidence that the British Empire will rapidly disintegrate. Britain's prestige and self-esteem are declining, and Britain is willing to give its British naval and air bases to the United States in exchange for fifty outdated torpedo boats. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Vichy – Regarding the news that the United States will transfer fifty destroyers to Britain, the French capital is very surprised and believes that this move will make the Anglo-German war even more difficult to resolve. Political circles in this region of France have strongly attacked this measure to prolong the war. (United Press Dispatch, 4th)

### Strong Public Resentment Against Territorial Cession: Tense Situation in Romania: Patriotic Soldiers Willing to Fight for Freedom: Serious Border Conflicts Again Arise Between Hungary and Romania

New York – The *New York Times*'s dispatch from Rome states that the situation in Romania is becoming increasingly tense, and all telephone communications have been cut off. (Reuters, 4th)

Grus – Yesterday, as a result of the opposition of Romanians throughout Outer Transylvania to ceding territory to Hungary, conflicts occurred in several small towns in the Satu Mare region south of the Romanian-Soviet border in Ruthenia. As a result, 80 Romanian soldiers and farmers died, and 100 Hungarians died. Senior Romanian officials here regard this conflict as a localized incident, and they believe that Romanian resistance will soon be extinguished. According to members of the royal family residing here, Hungarian troops have entered Outer Transylvania from the far north of Satu Mare, but have not yet advanced to the location where the two armies are engaged in battle. Meanwhile, over a hundred members of the 87th Romanian Infantry Regiment, carrying rifles and machine guns, who were left behind here, are currently leading guerrilla warfare. In addition, another group of 25 soldiers deserted their ranks to join the ranks of 100 members of the 817th Infantry Regiment. According to the captain, they will fight for the freedom of Outer Transylvania. It is said that many Romanian officials have also submitted their resignations in order to join the "rebels" in battle, but this has not been permitted by the authorities. Romanian soldiers carrying automatic rifles and machine guns established a circular line of defense in the workers' district of Grus yesterday, which accounts for over 15% of the city's population. This measure was taken because the authorities received information that Communist leaders are currently leading demonstrations against the government and the royal family. Armed soldiers closely guarded a certain shoe store, because it was reported that the store was actually a Communist base. At the same time, a Hungarian journalist, Karli Ritztai, was shot and killed on Monday evening, but he had first opened fire on a Romanian major general. It is said that Karli Ritztai, lying in a transport vehicle, opened fire on Romanian soldiers who were trying to arrest him, and the Romanian soldiers returned fire, killing him. (United Press, 4th)

Rome – The unease and opposition caused by the Vienna arbitration on the cession of Romanian territory gradually subsided yesterday, but reports of conflicts occurred on the northwestern frontier. Hungarian troops crossed into Romanian territory to assist Hungarian nationals in conflicts with Romanians. Details are still unreported. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Demonstrations Spread Across the Country: Leaflets Distributed Urging the King to Abdicate

Rome – Yesterday, countless people in the city distributed leaflets in the streets demanding the abdication of Romanian King Carol. Prior to this, someone fired several shots with a handgun at the guards in front of the palace to express resistance to the government. Reliable sources stated that the shooting occurred in front of the palace, but the rioters did not intend to attack the Romanian king. Two guards were immediately injured. Police stated that they immediately brought the situation under control afterwards. Reliable sources also stated that Iron Guard leader Horia Sima had recently returned from Berlin and joined the cabinet. It is rumored that the actions against the government are naturally led by him. Reliable sources further stated that the demonstrations have now spread throughout the country. The date on the leaflets is September 1, and the paper is very large. It states, "Abdication is the call of the entire country." Demonstrators were dispersed by police patrols carrying rifles and machine guns. A journalist told a United Press reporter that he feared that this reaction would spread to Grus and Brasov, because the telephone lines between the capital and the two cities had been cut off. The leaflets stated that the Iron Guard had decided to continue to extend the rule of the royal family, but Prince Michael must come forward as the monarch. The article also expressed attachment to the Axis powers. (United Press, 4th)

Berlin – Regarding the lies broadcast by certain news agencies about an armed revolution occurring in Romania and an assassination attempt on King Carol, the Romanian Prime Minister's Office declared that during the demonstrations, the telephone company and radio station were occupied by the demonstrators for some time, before they were driven out by the military police, and many people were arrested. The rumors that the demonstrators fired several shots in front of the palace to attempt to assassinate the king originated from this misunderstanding. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Iron Guard Members Arrogant and Unruly: Government Able to Control the Overall Situation

Rome – After extremist elements of the Iron Guard attempted to seize important locations here last night, troops have assembled and are on standby, and all public buildings are heavily guarded. Although Rome appears quite peaceful on the surface, it is extremely tense beneath the surface. Air raid sirens sounded inexplicably at 1:30 AM. In the evening, leaflets issued by the Iron Guard were found in various streets and markets. The government has issued a new order prohibiting the organization of political parties and demonstrations, and violators will be immediately detained in concentration camps. (Reuters, 4th)

Rome – A correspondent in Rome reported that someone distributed leaflets in the streets of Rome last night demanding the abdication of King Carol, signed by Horia Sima, a prominent member of the Iron Guard. However, the authorities immediately took action to stop the distribution of these leaflets. Today, the Romanian government has been able to control the overall situation and restore order. It is believed that although many members of the Iron Guard support these near-rebellious acts, not all members have adopted this attitude. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Germany Quietly Observes the Development of the Situation: Still Concerned About the Soviet Union

Rome – Senior German figures here told a United Press reporter last night that German troops will not enter Outer Transylvania unless a real war breaks out between Romania and Hungary. These figures stated, "We do not regard the current conflict as a war." Hungarian figures here assured a United Press reporter that "Hungarian troops will definitely not risk going to war against Romania." They stated, "Hungary has accepted the arbitration of the Axis powers, and the negotiations should naturally be carried out by the Axis powers." At the same time, demonstrations by Romanian nationalists have reached their peak. On Monday evening, demonstrators again stormed the German consulate in Brasov. According to eyewitnesses, these people tore down a German flag from a German official vehicle from the car. A Romanian cabinet member told a United Press reporter that he doubted whether the Romanian authorities could stop the anti-German and anti-Italian demonstrations. He admitted, "If the government cannot stop this movement, German troops may occupy Outer Transylvania." When asked how he guessed the Soviet Union's attitude would react when German troops occupied Outer Transylvania, he said, "You must know that the Soviet Union is not asleep, wait and see."

### Japan Plans to Establish a General Council: Promoting the New Political System Movement

Tokyo – The ultimate goal of the New Political System contains the establishment of a national organization within the scope of the constitutional provisions, but existing political parties and national entities will be asked to dissolve themselves and join the New Political System Movement. Before the organization is established, a New Political System National Council will be established, chaired by Prime Minister Konoe, with headquarters in Tokyo and district branches in each county and city. The General Council will have 300 members, divided into ten departments: General Affairs, Political Affairs, Organization, Parliamentary Affairs, Economy, Culture, Youth, Training, Propaganda, and Eastern Affairs. Headquarters and district branches will serve as a medium of contact between the people and the government, and between the people and the National Diet, county councils, and city councils. The current system will not be changed. The Japanese Emperor will oversee all national affairs. In addition, it is also planned to establish a Supreme Economic Committee and a Supreme Cultural Committee, directly controlled by the Prime Minister. These two committees will be the core of the proposed national organization. (Reuters, 4th)

### Japanese Navy Minister Resigns

Hong Kong – According to a Tokyo dispatch, Navy Minister Yoshida has requested to resign due to illness. Yoshida has served as Navy Minister in three consecutive cabinets since taking office on August 30 last year. Yoshida is currently suffering from stomach and heart ailments and was admitted to the Navy Medical School-affiliated hospital for treatment yesterday. (Dispatch, 4th)

### Soviet Union Recruits New Soldiers

Moscow – The authorities have ordered the continued conscription of people, including all those born in 1920, most of those born in 1921, and those born in 1922 who have received ten years of schooling. Older grades that were not previously conscripted have also been called up. (Reuters, 4th)

### Britain Assures US: Fleet Will Never Surrender: Enables US to Maintain Pacific Strength, Respond to Possible Crises in the Far East

Washington – According to sources here, Britain has declared to the United States that if British warships cannot defend the British Isles and the seas around them, Britain will never allow its fleet to surrender or be scuttled. It is said that Secretary of State Hull sent a letter to British Ambassador Lothian on August 19, asking whether the report that Britain had declared that it would never allow its fleet to be scuttled or surrender was accurate. The British ambassador replied that it was indeed the case. (Reuters, 4th)

Washington – It is widely believed that Britain's assurance to the United States that its fleet would never surrender or be scuttled was a major factor in the US's exchange of destroyers for bases. This allows the United States to maintain its navy in the Pacific, strengthening its ability to respond to possible crises in the Far East. Naval authorities here indicated that once the United States begins to occupy the new bases, Britain may deem it unnecessary to maintain a protective navy in the relevant areas, and British ships can then be transferred to other places in need. Although the use of naval bases must await agreement on restricted locations, it is reported that the US destroyers currently engaged in patrolling may enter them and periodic patrol flights will also begin. According to authorities, all bases have port facilities for cruisers and destroyers, and some already have air bases. The inclusion of US Army officers in the US committee sent to Bermuda indicates that the army may also be stationed in some bases. As for the joint management of the bases by the two countries, it is not a question. Once the United States takes over, the British Navy can only use it within the scope of international law, which stipulates the use of seaports for belligerents. A senior naval officer stated that due to the above restrictions, Britain seems to intend to redistribute its navy in the Atlantic. (Reuters, 4th)

Causes and Remedies for Marital Tragedy

The best family system in civilized society is monogamy. A couple, man strong and woman healthy, each fulfills their function. In rural society, the man farms and the woman weaves. In urban society, the man goes out to manage business or industry, and the woman manages household affairs at home. The love between husband and wife is intimate and tender, and the children born are lively and clever. This is of course a harmonious and healthy family. Such a healthy family not only enjoys happiness and joy, but it is also a good and stable foundation for society, which is of great importance to the nation. In our physiological and psychological research, a man and a woman are married because of their physiological needs, and they should harmonize their household, with deep love and joy. Why does tragedy have to happen in the family?

There are many causes of family tragedy, but apart from the man being too greedy, taking one wife, and then wanting a concubine or hiding another in a golden house, as the saying goes, "If you want discord in the family, take a concubine." In addition to adding women and creating chaos, the most common cause is the weakness of the man's sexual function. In our research on female psychology, unless she doesn't marry him, if she marries him, she gives her whole body and mind to him. As long as he can give her full joy and comfort, she will feel that he is the only one who can understand her in her life, so it is said that devoted women are betrayed by heartless men, and women are mostly devoted. However, if a man has committed masturbation or nocturnal emission in his early years, or has been indulgent and promiscuous after marriage, resulting in exhaustion of essence and blood, pathological changes occur in sexual function. In the brain, spinal cord, and nerves, he often feels head swelling, brain pain, forgetfulness, insomnia, tinnitus, blurred vision, mental disorder, back pain, and limb fatigue. How can such a man receive his wife's enthusiasm in marital life? To have one's enthusiasm betrayed is a heartbreaking thing! If she is sacrificed for a long time, how can she not become angry! Perform all kinds of tragedies in the family! In today's society, it is often heard that wives have relationships with others, or openly confront their husbands in court and file for divorce with eloquent words. When such a husband suffers this tragedy, his inner pain, if we think from his perspective, can we not shed tears? At the same time, due to physical weakness, how can he withstand such a serious stimulus? If he is too sad, he may form premature aging, or even die young!

However, smart men, we know that the above-mentioned diseases are not incurable. If treated according to the symptoms, health can be restored. According to world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, it is generally agreed that taking the "Reproductive Hormone," a preparation made from the gonads of strong animals, is the most effective treatment. This agent can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish nerves within one day and night after taking it. If it can be taken continuously, it can completely cure the above-mentioned diseases. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Simito's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gate and prevent leakage, and the effect will be even faster.

### Seminal Emission is the Most Harmful Disease to the Body

— Venereology Specialist Physician Zhan Nian-zeng

Because semen is the source of our life, seminal emission is the most harmful disease to the body. Now let us analyze it in the following points: The semen in a person's body is extracted from the most valuable nutrients in food, and through various subtle physical and chemical processes in physiology, it is produced by the testicles and flows into the seminal vesicles. If the flow is too much, it will indeed present a state of excessive heat and lead to spermatorrhea. Approximately healthy unmarried adult men may experience it once or twice a month. This is physiological and cannot be considered pathological. However, many people develop pathological seminal emission from spermatorrhea through masturbation, or from masturbation or other lustful thoughts. This must be prevented with caution. In short, unless semen is discharged through intercourse, (but excessive indulgence is also not advisable, as excessive indulgence has various drawbacks,) the deep retention of semen in the body is of great benefit to the body. This is because it functions to regulate metabolism, promote development, nourish various nerves, and has various uses such as strengthening the brain and kidneys, and increasing energy. If a young person has seminal emission, or if seminal emission deteriorates into spermatorrhea, then the semen in the body cannot be stored, inevitably leading to depletion of sperm and blood. This results in reduced metabolism, and in the body's various tissues, only old cells die while few new cells are produced, leading to a sallow complexion and thin physique, and reduced vitality. If this continues, premature aging may occur, development may be hindered, leading to short stature and small genitals like a child. In addition, the brain, spinal cord, and sexual nerves will also fall into a state of weakness, often experiencing mental fatigue, forgetfulness, insomnia, tinnitus, blurred vision, back pain, and physical fatigue. Kidney deficiency and impotence may occur, and sperm leakage may lead to loss of focus. Furthermore, the continuous leakage of semen and the body's inability to produce enough semen can lead to a lack of sperm or even complete absence of sperm, resulting in infertility. ... From all of this, we can see that seminal emission not only harms the body but can also lead to infertility, so its danger is significant! As for sexual weakness, which makes marital life unfulfilling, it will create a great tragedy in life! According to world-renowned doctors and my own experience, the only treatment for this condition is to take "Hemetol Pills for Semen Consolidation," which is the most effective. After taking it, it can immediately consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, and eliminate evil thoughts, and seminal emission can be completely eradicated. However, if seminal emission has already caused the above-mentioned symptoms, it is necessary to also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadotropin" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, nourish the nerves, regulate metabolism, and promote development. With continued use, health can be fully restored soon.

### Look! How Important the Breasts Are

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

They actually control a woman's life and destiny

"No matter how beautiful a peony is, it all depends on the green leaves for support." No matter how beautiful a woman is, if she doesn't have a pair of prominent breasts and plump hips to reveal her curvaceous beauty, then even if she wears a brocade robe (cheongsam), adorns herself with precious jewelry, wears sheer stockings, and applies lipstick and makeup, she will still feel that something is missing, just like a peony without green leaves. Not only will she be unable to confidently show off her beauty in social gatherings and will be laughed at, but also in the private life between husband and wife, imagine the appearance of a flat and featureless chest suddenly entering your husband's eyes. What will you feel in your heart at this time? What will your husband feel? I know that even if your husband doesn't say it to your face, his love for you will gradually cool down, or he may even constantly go out to sing and dance, and patronize prostitutes. Although you will be very unhappy, when you think of your own shortcomings, you will have to suffer in silence and feel depressed. Moreover, as a result of breast atrophy, the function of the ovaries, which is related to a woman's overall health, will inevitably become impaired, and the ability of metabolism will also be disrupted. As a result, menstrual irregularities, vaginal discharge, cold uterus and infertility, and decreased libido will inevitably follow one after another, leading to difficult childbirth and ultimately not being able to conceive. Even with millions in assets, you will have to hand them over to others. Thinking about this, breasts are really very important for a woman's happiness.

So, is there really no way to make up for this kind of defect? According to the unanimous opinion of world-renowned physiologist and beauty expert Kang Delin and gynecologist Tang Posheng, if a woman suffers from breast atrophy, small hips, menstrual irregularities, excessive discharge and infertility, and decreased libido, she can take the ovarian preparation for women "Gonadotropin" invented by Austrian Dr. Kidana, which is the most effective treatment for these symptoms. This preparation is made from the essence of animal ovaries through scientific refining. Just imagine: supplementing the ovaries of women with impaired ovarian function with the essence of healthy animal ovaries, no wonder it can exert its great medicinal power overnight after taking it, boosting metabolism, regulating menstruation, warming the uterus and stopping discharge. With continued use, it can make the atrophied breasts gradually become prominent, and the thin hips become plump, and it can also increase blood circulation, making the complexion and skin glow with a fresh red color from the moisturized and fair skin.

Do you want your leucorrhea to get better soon?

When we deal with any matter in society, before we get our hands on it, we may think that this matter is very difficult and not easy to deal with, but the result is that it is resolved very smoothly. There are also times when, before we get our hands on it, we feel that this matter is very clear and can be handled quickly, but the result is that not only can we not get the matter done, but we can't even find a clue. Therefore, I believe that there is absolutely nothing easy or absolutely nothing difficult in the world. This is not only true for any matter in society, but also for the treatment of leucorrhea. For example, many people think that sexual leucorrhea is easy to treat, but there are still so many people suffering from chronic leucorrhea. Have they all gone through the acute phase? As for saying that chronic leucorrhea is difficult to treat, but as far as I am concerned, I have cured no less than six thousand out of every ten people. All of them have been proven to be non-toxic by the health authorities, and they have never relapsed. In short, whether it is acute or chronic, if the physician has rich experience, exquisite surgery, keen eyesight, outstanding equipment, does not exaggerate to deceive people, serves with sincerity, diagnoses accurately, and prescribes the right medicine, even if the symptoms are extremely severe, he can still be sure of success. I guarantee that it will be completely resolved in as little as two weeks or as long as five weeks, and there is absolutely no need to worry about recurrence. If the physician's skills are clumsy, the equipment is incomplete, and he fails to serve with sincerity, then even the first appearance of new leucorrhea, hum; I am afraid that you can forget about getting better in time.

### British Planes Fly Across the Strait, Fiercely Bombarding the French Coast, Bomb Explosions Clearly Audible Across the Sea, Berlin Area Continues to Be Raided by Royal Air Force

By our correspondent at Wangfo, Yesterday afternoon, anti-aircraft guns were as dense as a string of pearls, with deafening sounds, lasting for more than an hour. I heard that these gun sounds came from the French coast across the Strait, interspersed with a loud bang, which was clearly the sound of bomb explosions. It turned out that the British Royal Air Force was concentrating its bombardment on German gun positions and German forces along the French coast. The sound of explosions in the Calais and Pirodon areas on the other side of the Strait gradually increased, even affecting 20 miles along the French coast. After the sound of explosions stopped, British bombers returned to their bombing targets again to carry out attacks, about sixteen or eighteen times. (United Press International report from the 4th)

London, The Air Ministry stated that yesterday the German Air Force twice attempted to break through the defenses of southeastern England but could not withstand the resistance of British fighter planes. A total of 25 German planes were shot down in British airspace. The target of the German planes' two attacks seemed to be British airfields. In the first attack, about 100 to 150 German planes attacked at high altitude over the Thames Estuary. During the first air raid, a newly formed Czech squadron in the British Air Force shot down seven German planes, while the squadron only lost one Czech pilot. It is understood that the squadron has shot down a total of sixteen German planes so far. (Reuters report from the 4th)

London, The Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security announced that German planes carried out air raids on Britain last night on a small scale.

There were few casualties in the northwest and northeast. It is also heard that a small number of high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs fell in the Bristol Channel area, but there were no casualties and the losses were also minimal. German planes were also quite active over Wales, but there were no civilian casualties. The air raid alarm was sounded in the London area at 8:20 this morning and was lifted 20 minutes later. Fierce fighting occurred at an altitude of 15,000 feet off the southeastern coast. A large number of enemy planes were attacked by British fighter planes. The enemy planes' formation was disrupted and they fled towards the French coast. (Reuters report from the 4th)

### Chinese Troops in Shanxi, Repeatedly Capture Strongholds

Xingji, On the evening of the 27th of last month, the Chinese general Bei Hai-du (north of Xiyang) recovered. On the evening of the 28th, he also occupied Yaodi, capturing many enemy soldiers. On the morning of the 29th, two units of Japanese troops from Xiyang launched an attack and engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army in the Yangjiafeng area. Zanggangkou, north of Liaoxian, was also captured by the Chinese on the evening of the 27th. The Chinese army also launched an attack on the northern suburbs of the county seat, annihilating many Japanese soldiers and capturing one Japanese soldier. (Telegram from the 3rd)

Luoyang, In recent weeks, the Chinese troops in Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei have achieved great results, especially in the border area of Shanxi and Hebei, where they have won an unprecedented victory, dealing a great blow to the Japanese troops in North China. Since the Chinese army launched a counterattack on the Pinghan and Zhengtai lines, they have destroyed more than a dozen iron bridges south of Baoding on the Pinghan line, as well as many rails and power lines, and have also captured Fangshunqiao Station. At the same time, they cut off the highways on both sides of the railway and launched a converging attack on the Japanese strongholds, killing more than a thousand Japanese soldiers. The Zhengtai Chinese army has also been very active recently. On the evening of the 20th, they launched a fierce attack on Niangziguan, fighting bloodily for several days and nights. They finally recovered the pass on the morning of the 23rd and completely destroyed the Jingxing coal mine, blowing up all the mine shafts and machinery. The Japanese industry has suffered a major blow. The Chinese army west of Zhengtai took the opportunity to launch a large-scale attack on the Japanese troops in Pingding, Yangquan, and Shouyang, fighting fiercely for days. The Japanese troops were attacked from both east and west and were unable to hold out. The Chinese army then captured Potou and Shitong stations in one fell swoop and recovered the nearby strongholds one after another. The Japanese army, seeing the serious situation, urgently transferred troops from southern Shanxi to reinforce. The Chinese army is still continuing to attack the Japanese troops. The heavy damage caused by this large-scale counterattack on the Pinghan and Zhengtai lines has not been seen in months. The Japanese transportation has been cut off and has not been able to resume for many days. Although there have been no fierce battles in southern Shanxi in recent days, there have been small skirmishes almost every day. The Japanese troops east of Wenxi and Xiaxian have been swept away by the Chinese army. At the same time, the encirclement of the Japanese troops on the Zhangmao Highway has yielded quite a few gains. Most of the Japanese troops in northern Henan are still concentrated in the Qinbo area. A unit had previously moved north to reinforce Pinghan. In recent days, the Chinese army has carried out flanking attacks in the western section of the Daoqing Railway and attacked the Japanese troops in Qinbo. In eastern Henan, the fighting has been silent recently. The main forces of the Chinese and Japanese armies are still holding their original positions. Overall, the Chinese army has an absolute advantage in Shanxi and Henan. They have been able to make thorough deployments and agile actions in various strongholds and carry out decisive counterattacks. Therefore, the evolution of the war situation will become more and more favorable to China. (Telegram from the 3rd)

They have now been incorporated and trained, awaiting orders to serve the country. (Telegram from the 3rd)

Random Talks on the European War (2)

### The Down-and-Out Youth Hitler

After his mother's burial, he took the remaining money and returned to Vienna. In a few months, this young man, who was unwilling to obey his father's order to become a government official, became increasingly degenerate, reaching the lowest levels of the economy and society. From the age of twenty to twenty-three, the young Hitler lived a vagrant life. He stayed in a small inn in Vienna, and every day he went to the church for a bowl of free soup. In the winter, he swept snow for others. His enemies later exaggerated and embellished how miserable he was during this down-and-out period. Some people heard that he had worked as a bookbinder or a painter, and some even said that he had some physiological defects and was like an idiot, and that he might go crazy at any time. In fact, these were nothing more than made-up jokes. In short, at this time, he was very unsuccessful, failing at everything he did, and often blaming others. He became more and more dissatisfied with the world, which was the truth.

In the months before he began his vagrant life, he had worked as a brick carrier for a construction company in Vienna. At that time, he told himself and those who were willing to listen to him with a proud attitude that he was willing to do this job well and work his way up to become an architect. He dressed like a student and had the appearance of "a crane standing among chickens." His companions asked him to join the union, but he refused. At meal times, he ate only milk, bread, and cheese, and did not drink beer. The other workers found him very strange and used many words to test the truth about him. They explained their political ideas on national affairs and diplomacy. From the workers' point of view, they were all socialists who were not very clear about their own ideas. They attacked capitalists and bureaucrats; they also discussed religion and various moral issues.

Hitler's understanding of their arguments was rather vague, which was not surprising, because he was still a young man with limited knowledge. He opposed the middle class, opposed the dictatorship of the common people, or a workers' government, but did not know what he believed in. He dreamed of a strong and great German Federation so that he would not be ashamed to be a citizen of this country. At lunchtime, he would often squat on the scaffolding, silently listening to the workers' arguments. Suddenly, in a state of excitement and with nervous emotions triggered by a hateful psychology, he would give a loud speech to the workers. Although he tried his best to convey his deep and strong emotions, he always failed to express himself clearly. Simply because he was only twenty years old, did not read much, had no central ideas, and did not know how to stir people up, he did not arouse anyone's attention. Soon, the workers not only ridiculed him but also showed their dislike for him. One day, he was giving a torrent of speech when he was interrupted by his companions, who told him to leave immediately and not come back, otherwise they would beat him off the scaffolding. He was rejected by this group of first-time listeners and had to leave.

His vagrant life began from then on. However, the period of Hitler's diligent reading in his life also began at this time. Because he was humiliated by the workers on the scaffolding, his reading had its own unique perspective: first, he wanted to restore his self-esteem and use facts and rational principles to support his emotions; second, he wanted to realize the idea of a Greater Germany in his mind and did not want to end his life as a vagrant or an ordinary worker. He advocated reading for practical purposes. This young Adolf buried himself in hard reading every day, using his companions in the small inn as opponents for debate. His personal view of the world gradually took shape from this, and he regarded it as his own savior of self-esteem. He was penniless and starving. Once he started his self-study work, he first read Marx's works and concluded that the mastermind behind the union was the Communist Party. He hated the union deeply. Later, he read books about Jews; he thought that the Jews were the mastermind behind the Communist Party. The middle class he hated, with its bureaucratic habits, and the educational system they set, which prevented him from becoming an architect, were all the fault of these Jews. What he read and thought about was mostly like this.

Hitler lived in a small inn, making a living by painting postcards sporadically, which a friend helped him sell on the street. Sometimes, he painted a large watercolor painting and put it next to the stove in the public room to dry it, which not only made the paint dry easily but also covered the picture with a layer of yellow, making it look like an ancient painting from many years ago. He randomly chose the name of a painter who was not very famous for decades and signed it in the corner of the painting, and his friend would then take it to the beer hall and sell it to tourists at a high price.

The residents in the small inn were always people who talked a lot. This was the case in any country or any place in the world. The "gentlemen" here were all underfed and poorly clothed; at night, they slept on hard wire mattresses and were only covered with a thin blanket. They took off the clothes they wore during the day, rolled them up, and put them under their heads as pillows. If this group of people were told not to talk, wouldn't they be suffocated? The young Hitler was the most talkative among them. He didn't just talk about politics; he had a lot of topics to talk about. Many friends also liked to listen to his wonderful arguments. Because no matter what, it was better than being hungry and helpless in the corner; and it could also relieve boredom. Hitler told them how they should cooperate with his guidance. He arranged for someone to learn painting, someone to design advertisements, someone to specialize in painting signs, and the rest to go out and sell these things. In this way, everyone could make a living.

He was quick-witted and had many ideas. According to his companion, Mr. So-and-so, Hitler's interesting stories are as follows: One day, Hitler saw an advertisement for hair tonic in the newspaper, which showed a woman with long hair on the ground. The text began by saying, "I, Anna, Kexila... used to be bald, but how I grew a head of black hair by using this hair tonic, so I tried my best to introduce this reliable thing to the public." Hitler's friends took this as the center of discussion, to study whether there was a woman named Anna Kexila, and whether her hair had actually grown back by using this hair tonic. Hitler thought this was obviously a scam, but his friends were a little doubtful, thinking that if the manufacturer of the hair tonic was not sure, how could they come up with an Anna Kexila and say that the hair tonic was effective?

Hitler was indeed clever. He said without a doubt that this advertisement was a scam. He said that if his friends agreed, he would also do such a trick to earn some money for them. When they heard this, they couldn't help but light up and hurriedly asked how to do it. Hitler said, "Well, you go and get some old horseshoe-shaped iron cans, fill them with glue, and sell them to the shops, telling them to put the glue on the large glass windows, so that the glass will not crack in cold weather." His friends laughed at him after hearing this. They said, "Where does the glue come from? Don't you need money for glue?" Hitler said, "Don't worry, you can use anything to pretend to be glue - the soup in the kitchen, or more simply, get some lime from the brickyard, mix it with water, and you're done." His friends retorted, "Then it's not glue, how can it prevent the glass from cracking in winter?" Hitler said, "We can sell it in the summer. And tell the shopkeepers that things used in winter are much cheaper if you buy them in summer."

One idea came to Hitler, and another idea came up. He said that banknotes should be made smaller and put in a clear box so that they would be easy to use and not easily broken. His friends said that this was "inconceivable." After everyone talked a lot like this, they prepared to go to sleep. First, they took off their shirts and socks to wash them in preparation for wearing them dry in the morning. Some of them washed their clothes every night, while others washed them occasionally. Hitler was one of those who washed them occasionally. At that time, there was a companion who was a farmer's son from the countryside of Saxony, who often joked, "Hitler is washing his shirt, it must be sunny tomorrow." (To be continued)

### French Concession Under Tight Security, Maintaining Order Within its Borders, Taking the Same Steps as the International Settlement, Rumored to Continue Until September 18th

The police authorities of the British and French concessions in this city decided to jointly take special security measures at twelve o'clock the night before last, and immediately carried out various security arrangements overnight, which were completed by dawn. By yesterday, iron wire barriers had been placed at all important road intersections in the two concessions, and additional detectives were stationed at the missing places to strictly inspect pedestrians and vehicles. At the same time, patrol teams and armored vehicles from the two concessions were also dispatched one after another, patrolling the roads within the concessions without stopping, so that petty criminals could not move around. All measures were the same as on important commemorative days, and the security measures in the French Concession were even more stringent. The International Settlement, on the other hand, was more moderate. According to informed sources, this security measure will continue for several weeks because the "September 18th" anniversary is approaching. The details are as follows:

French Police Department Explains the Meaning

According to a spokesperson for the French Concession Police Department, the measures taken by the French Concession to set up barbed wire at important intersections have no special significance. The general public in this city has been arguing endlessly about the French Concession's repeated erection of barbed wire obstacles, but the spokesperson solemnly stated that the special security period around the third anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai achieved very good results. Therefore, this is a repeat of those actions. The spokesperson finally stated that the French Concession authorities have no special purpose in re-adopting this measure.

Its function is only to facilitate the search work of the police.

Reasons for Security Measures as Reported by Western Newspapers

The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Bao" stated that the police authorities of the French Concession and the International Settlement have taken security measures within their borders from midnight to today (the 4th), without respite. Reliable sources in this city believe that the reason why the police authorities have taken these security measures is because a certain group intends to carry out retaliatory violence today after the assassination of Liu Na'ou. Shortly after midnight, barbed wire was erected across many thoroughfares in the two concessions, and the number of patrol officers and search teams was greatly increased. They carried out strict searches at night and continued to perform their duties until this morning. It is understood that Liu Na'ou was assassinated at the Jinghua Restaurant on Fuzhou Road at 2:15 p.m. yesterday (the 3rd). It is reported that the police have now detained two suspects who witnessed the shooting.

Temporary Decision Based on Information Obtained

The claim that a certain group intends to carry out retaliatory violence was confirmed this morning by an official from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department. He said that the police authorities took security measures after receiving information. An official from the French Concession Police Department first said that the security measures taken were "only routine duties," but then immediately admitted that they had cooperated with the police of the International Settlement yesterday evening and taken this action. The reporter then asked Shi Maoru, the deputy police chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council, to explain the reasons for the security measures. Shi admitted that the police department had taken this action after obtaining information, but the information obtained was very concise, and he did not say anything else.

Shops and Lanes Prepared for Search

Although the security measures in the French Concession began on the 31st of last month, they reached an unprecedented level of stringency yesterday. The French defense forces and the French patrolmen and police officers were almost fully mobilized and deployed at the gaps in various roads to strictly enforce the inspection of pedestrians and vehicles. Armored vehicles were more active than before, and patrol teams of five or six people patrolled everywhere from time to time, all armed with live ammunition and fully equipped. Detectives set off to conduct searches in various shops and lanes based on real-time intelligence. In addition, the French Overseas Volunteers, etc., were waiting for orders to be dispatched at any time. All preparations have been completed to fulfill the responsibility of protecting the security of the concession.

The Western District of the International Settlement is the Most Strict

As for the International Settlement, patrolmen have been dispatched to all important roads, such as the gaps along Edward Road and the southern entrances of various bridges on the Suzhou River, to strictly defend them. Patrol teams and armored vehicles have also begun to move around, patrolling everywhere and selectively inspecting pedestrians and vehicles. Yesterday, the area where the security measures were most stringent in the International Settlement was the western district, with a large number of detectives stationed at the road intersections adjacent to the "badlands" of western Shanghai to strictly search pedestrians. Red security vehicles also gathered in the western district to maintain order. There were no reports of foreign defense forces being dispatched in the International Settlement, but the Shanghai Volunteer Corps was on duty as usual.

Iron Wire Obstacles Widely Distributed

All roads in the French Concession along Edward Road have been equipped with barbed wire obstacles, with gaps left only at the Bund, Catholic Church Street, Great World, Ma Huo Road, Sacred Heart Road, Albert Road, and other places to maintain traffic. Henan Road and Dongxinqiao Street, which have never been closed, were also blocked yesterday. In addition, more barbed wire obstacles have been added to various non-essential roads in the central area of the French Concession for immediate use and search. Yesterday, Luban Road and Kangti Road were also barricaded, and the atmosphere in the area remained extremely tense. In the International Settlement, gaps were blocked only at Edward Road, the Bund, Jiangxi Road, Fujian Road, Great World, and other places. There were no changes in other areas.

Armed Japanese Soldiers Enter the French Concession

At around 10:00 a.m. yesterday, six Japanese military police officers wearing yellow cloth uniforms with "Suzuki" signs on their chests were discovered in the Mintiniyin Road area of the French Concession, led by a Japanese person wearing a dark blue suit. Among them, four military police officers had command knives hanging from their waists and wore yellow puttees, while the other two had knives hanging from their waists and water bottles on their backs, and wore yellow cloth leggings. When the French-Vietnamese patrolmen stationed near the Great World saw this, the Fourth Vietnamese patrolman stopped them near the tram stop for questioning. At the same time, the French patrolmen telegraphed the Lujiawan Police Station to request instructions. It was not until half an hour later that they headed south, took the tenth tram at Baxianqiao, and turned west towards Pinban Road. At around 11:00 a.m., the group of seven people returned via French Main Street from the Zhubaoshan Road area. Also, at 10:40 a.m. yesterday, a large contingent of Japanese troops in the Nanshi area boarded ten Japanese military trucks, each carrying about forty or fifty people, and sped north from the Ximen Heping Road through the Nanyang Bridge Iron Gate, Mintiniyin Road, the Great World, and Yu Qiaqing Road, and turned towards Hongkou. It is reported that these Japanese troops were stationed in the Longhua, Minhang, Xujiahui, and Huazhuang areas of Nanshi and were being transferred to Hongkou and Zhabei.

### Admiral Hart Arrives in Shanghai Under City-Wide Security Alert; Sudden Trip, Reasons Unknown; Asiatic Fleet to Concentrate in Shanghai Again

The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Bao" reported that Admiral Hart, commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, unexpectedly arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao on the US light cruiser Marblehead at 1:00 p.m. today (the 4th). The reason for Admiral Hart's sudden arrival in Shanghai has not been disclosed. It is also expected that the flagship of the Asiatic Fleet, the Augusta, will arrive here in the latter half of this month, and it is expected that other US ships will also come south soon. It is reported that Admiral Hart went to the US Navy Office at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road at around 3:00 p.m. and had a long meeting with Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet, and Colonel Baker, commander of the Shanghai defense forces. The content of the meeting is unknown, but it is generally believed that it must be related to the situation in the concession in this city. Residents of Shanghai have been experiencing a series of assassinations and kidnappings, and it seems that it is not easy to succeed without strengthening the strength of the defense forces of neutral countries and taking strict security measures. Therefore, upon learning of Admiral Hart's arrival in Shanghai, they all expressed their warm and heartfelt joy.

### Jardine Matheson's Tai Sang Arrives in Shanghai from Haiphong Yesterday

Jardine Matheson's Tai Sang arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. The ship left Haiphong after the blockade on the 26th without being hindered and carried more than 100 passengers from Haiphong to Hong Kong and Shanghai. According to one passenger, he did not see any Japanese ships stationed there when he left Haiphong. The ship is scheduled to sail to Tianjin and other places on the 6th.

### German Ship Jiangding Suddenly Detained Yesterday Morning; Forced to Sail and Dock Along the Gaocangmiao River; Reasons for Detention Not Announced by Either Party

The German merchant ship Jiangding, with a load of 198 tons, was chartered by the Tongxing Shipping Company on the second floor of the Hongsheng Building on Sichuan Road, and sailed to the ports of Beisha, Haimen, and Qidong along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. It had participated in direct shipping to Shanghai and Ningbo once.

(It stopped the day before yesterday) at Pier No. 14 on the Bund of Renji Road, loaded more than 150 tons of sugar, cotton cloth, groceries, etc., and was scheduled to sail to Qinglong Port yesterday morning.

The truth about the ship's detention is being kept strictly secret by Lihe and Tongxing, and they refuse to announce it.

### Rumors of Telephone Price Increase; Decision Expected by the End of the Month; Whether it Can Be Implemented is Questionable

In recent days, there have been rumors that the Shanghai Telephone Company will increase telephone rates again. A reporter from Pingming News inquired with the company yesterday afternoon and learned that the company authorities have indeed considered this, and a decision on the price increase will be made before the end of this month. However, the amount of the increase and whether the price increase will be uniform for business, household, and company telephones have not yet been determined. According to sources, since the Shanghai war, Shanghai's blind industries have developed abnormally, and speculative activities are extremely rampant. As a result, the number of telephone users has increased year by year. Recently, the company claimed that the telephone directories have often been revised in a few months. If the price increase is true, whether the municipal authorities will allow it is still questionable.

### Daylight Saving Time to End on a Specific Date; Termination on October 12th

### Speculative Rice Merchants Disregard Price Limits; Actually Use Gold Prices as a Basis; Disregard Price Limits as Insignificant

Norwegian-owned "Pulin" ship delivered around 26,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, arrived in Shanghai yesterday, of which 10,000 bags were ordered by the Price Stabilization Committee. Stockpiling of foreign rice in Hong Kong has not been interrupted. For days still shipping to Shanghai in response to the market.

Price Stabilization Deadline

The fifth phase of cheap broken rice, started on the 20th of last month, is 20 days up to the 8th of this month. It was decided to follow the established method, with 20 days as a phase, so the fifth phase of price stabilization will end on that day. The sixth phase of price stabilization is awaiting the official decision of the committee.

Yesterday's Market Tight

The market situation at yesterday morning's rice shop tea party was still quite tight. Although the Price Evaluation Committee announced the implementation of new price limits, the buying and selling of foreign rice in various stalls seemed to be exceeding the price limits, and the "scalping" trend was quite rampant. If the entire rice market continues in this way, the future troubles will be difficult to resolve. It is heard that the market buying and selling prices are based on the daily gold trading prices. If gold rises, the opening price is higher, and if the gold price is small, the opening price is slightly lower.

### Shanghai Bank Deposits Transferred to the Interior to Increase Interest; Shanghai Banks Pay Interest Without Remittance; Credit Deposits Distribute Profits

Shanghai's floating capital is a disaster, competing for opportunities. In addition to open trading, there are dark trading, and in addition to black markets, there are dark markets, resulting in daily changes in commodity prices and difficulties in people's livelihoods. The government authorities are extremely concerned about the situation in Shanghai. It is learned that the authorities have accepted expert advice and are planning to implement the following two points to encourage the transfer of floating capital to the interior: (1) The four banks of the China Farmer Bank, or other major banks, promote deposits and increase interest rates. Depositors specify the transfer to a certain place in the interior, but the interest is paid by the Shanghai bank without remittance. (2) A consortium organizes West-North-South industrial companies in Shanghai to specialize in credit deposits, with a weekly interest rate of 7%. If there is a surplus, the consortium and the depositors share it equally. Experts pointed out that the above methods are beneficial to the livelihood assets of Shanghai citizens and the future of national construction, so the authorities have decided to implement them.

### Three Shanghai Ships Arrive Safely at Songmen and Fuqing

### Industry After the Start of Autumn is Gradually Becoming Active; The Trend of Speculation Has Declined; Some Manufacturers Feel Distressed

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial Section's August report, the trend of purchasing goods for speculation in this city since May has been suppressed. No such incidents were found last month. Most factories have suffered losses due to the delayed shipments of general speculative buyers, because the current sales price of these inventories is lower than the recent manufacturing price. According to yarn factory operators, the government's change in the commercial exchange rate on August 1 and the gradual decline in the exchange rate, coupled with the reduction in interest rates, may prevent the current situation from worsening. The work of several industries is relatively slack in the summer and awaits purchases after the autumn harvest. However, there are also many types of goods that can continue to be shipped and sold to the interior. Cigarette factories have returned to their original state of work. Factories that manufacture nails, needles, door locks, hinges, clock hands, fountain pens, zippers, etc. are busy. Hosiery and other clothing factories are able to maintain the situation of their respective products. Hand-woven fabrics for export are also very active. There are six silk factories in operation, only two of which have obtained fresh supplies. The rayon weaving industry is in a downturn. Of the 21 paint spraying factories, those whose work was in danger ceased operations last month. The total number of these factories that have ceased operations is 43. Another five have hired qualified engineers to be responsible for designing and correcting equipment. Due to factors such as reduced work and high living costs, industrial disputes still occur frequently. Last month, the Industrial Section explained a total of nine such disputes, including five due to reduced work, one due to requests for increased rice subsidies, and three due to requests for improved treatment. There were three strike incidents in the disputes, affecting 1,370 workers and four factories.

### Large Quantities of Military Supplies Seized in Xujiahui

The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Bao" reported that the British Supreme Court for China, the oldest foreign court in China, is celebrating its 75th anniversary today (the 4th). In these 75 years, it has achieved outstanding success in protecting the vast commercial interests of the British in China. It is understood that the British Supreme Court for China was established by Sir Hope on September 4, 1865. At that time, China was still isolated from the world, Shanghai was just a village, and the houses along the Huangpu River were sparsely populated. Most of the remaining land was fields for planting cotton and grain, interspersed with small houses built by foreigners. The eight judges of the British Supreme Court for China have personally witnessed Shanghai's development from a small village to a large city in these 75 years. The most important decision of the court in its early days was that the Shanghai Municipal Council had legal status and the right of self-government. Today, the only foreign courts in China representing foreign countries are the British and American Supreme Courts. Sir Mosso, the British Supreme Court Judge, has 25 years of legal experience in China and has held this position since 1933.

### Dismissed Detective Arrested for Kidnapping Dies of Syphilis: Case Unresolved, Dies in Hospital

Peng Guangyuan, also known as Bu Guangquan, a native of Jiangbei residing at 294 Kangti Road in the French Concession, was 24 years old this year. He was formerly a detective in the French police force but was dismissed for misconduct.

### Unified Enrollment of Public Colleges and Universities This Year: More than 5,600 Students Admitted, Engineering is the Most Popular, Followed by Law and Commerce

Chongqing, 4th) This year's unified enrollment of public colleges and universities was held simultaneously in 16 examination districts and 17 branches across the country. A total of 38 colleges and universities are enrolling. Except for the three examination districts of Luoyang, Taihe, and Shanghai, the registration numbers from all districts have been received, totaling 15,513 applicants. The actual number of examinees was 14,672. Currently, the results of each district have been reviewed, and a total of 5,627 new university students, 1,117 students in the university preparatory class, and 180 new students from schools that need to be recruited on their behalf have been admitted. All have been assigned to various colleges and universities for enrollment based on the candidates' aspirations, grades, and region, and with reference to the enrollment quota of each school. The list was posted in Chongqing by the Ministry on September 3. This year, the number of admissions based on candidates' aspirations is the largest for engineering, followed by law and commerce, then liberal arts and teachers' colleges, while science, agriculture, and medicine are relatively few. The admission standards are carefully formulated with reference to national needs and the level of universities in order to adapt to the quality and performance of this year's candidates. Because of the strict restrictions on equivalent qualifications, the level is more uniform. Last year, those who applied with secondary school graduation qualifications accounted for 75%, and those with equivalent qualifications accounted for 25%. This year, those applying with high school graduation qualifications account for only 6%. The quality of candidates should be better than last year. Last year, the ratio of applicants to admissions was four to one, and this year it is about three to one. Superficially, this year seems to be inferior, but in fact, the quality of this year's candidates is better, and the level is naturally more uniform. This year, the average score in each district increased by two points compared to last year, which can be seen from this. As for the students who have not been admitted, in addition to some who can be employed, various vocational schools, private universities, and military schools are currently recruiting. Students still have the opportunity to apply, so they will not lose their education, it is said.

### Gold Market Swayed by Rumors, Wildly Fluctuating

Yesterday, after soaring on the black market, spot gold fell again. Due to confusing news, trading was intense, with countless ups and downs. In the early morning, with continued optimism, the market jumped 60 yuan at the opening to 6350 yuan. Shortly after, a sharp weakening in foreign exchange triggered a large buying wave, especially with bullion houses adding to their long positions, pushing the price up to 6440 yuan. However, this was influenced by securities firms and retail investors taking profits at high prices. At the same time, negative rumors suddenly prevailed, leading to more sellers and pushing the price down to 6310 yuan. The market eventually closed at 6330 yuan, a 40 yuan increase from the previous day's settlement. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. Off-exchange trading was initially weak but then recovered, with rumors of Japanese troops landing at the coastal defense, driving the price to around 6370-6380 yuan. Trading was quite active in the first half of the day, with about 3,000 taels changing hands. Gold shops eventually raised the price of jewelry by 10 yuan, while customs duties remained unchanged.

Spot Gold Rises by 40 Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (10 taels) initially jumped 60 yuan at the opening to 6350 yuan due to tight exchange rates and continued firm sentiment, with all parties initially calling for buying. Subsequently, the price rose another 20 yuan due to continued strong buying, with bullion houses buying 20 taels for securities firms at 6370 yuan. Later, bullion houses and other parties sold off, and Yinyi also sold off, causing a temporary decline. Qiankuang also sold 30 taels of gold, falling to 6335 yuan. Afterwards, due to increased tightness in the exchange market, a certain bullion house added to its long positions, and another bullion house also bought over 1,000 taels. Soon, the buying frenzy pushed the price up by 105 yuan, with bullion houses buying 50 taels from jewelry stores at a new recent high of 6440 yuan. Later, some retail investors took profits at high prices. Shortly after, a certain securities firm with a large long position suddenly sold off, and the long position company of the bullion house also sold off, causing the market to suddenly reverse and fall to within 6400 yuan. At the same time, rumors of negative news from within the country spread in the market, leading to a gradual increase in selling pressure. The certain bullion house that had been aggressively buying initially also started to sell off, eventually reaching a low of 6310 yuan before the afternoon close. However, the market recovered slightly at the close, ending at 6330 yuan, still up 40 yuan from the previous day. Off-exchange trading was flat and weak after the close, with transactions at 6310 yuan. However, off-exchange trading recovered in the afternoon due to rumors of Japanese troops landing at the coastal defense, rising to 6370-6380 yuan. There was a total fluctuation of 130 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold at bullion houses was about a dozen yuan higher than the actual gold price, while the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan.

### More Foreign Currencies Rise Than Fall

Trading in British gold notes gradually decreased, with the market price stabilizing. The US dollar note once reached 19.36 yuan, but then suddenly fell to 19.1 yuan near noon due to rumors that Soong Tzu-wen was to be appointed Minister of Finance. In the afternoon, rumors of Japanese troops landing at the coastal defense caused it to rise again to 19.2 yuan, ultimately rising by 0.28 yuan from the previous day. The Hong Kong dollar note continued to rise along with the exchange rates between Hong Kong and Shanghai. The Singapore dollar note was slightly in demand, causing the market price to rise slightly. The Japanese yen note continued to decline, falling to 1.6 yuan in the evening market, down another 0.065 yuan from the previous day. The Korean won note was also oversupplied, falling to 1.17 yuan in the evening market.

### Bank of Issue Should Indicate Whether Fractional Notes are Genuine or Counterfeit

Since this newspaper first reported the discovery of 5-cent counterfeit notes in the market, most stores have been paying attention. Today's newspaper reports that a reporter from Pingming News Agency gave a detailed explanation of the differences between genuine and counterfeit 5-cent notes, which is more convenient for those who receive and pay with fractional notes to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit notes. However, the first point raised by the agency: "The English at the end of the reverse side of a genuine note is (UNION PUBLISHERS&PRINTERS, FED. INC. U.S.A.), while the counterfeit note is (UNIONPRINTING CO. U.S.A.)." This reporter compared it with a 1-cent auxiliary note and found that both types of English appear at the end of the reverse side of the 1-cent note. The former paper is smooth, while the latter paper is slightly rougher. The former color is deep and glossy, while the latter is light and dull. The former has English letters on both the left and right ends of the number, while the latter only has an English letter on the left side. However, the versions are very clear, fine, and precise, and the sizes are the same, making it impossible to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit notes. It is believed that 1-cent notes should not be counterfeited, perhaps due to batch printing. (I am attaching two types of fractional notes for the editor to review.)

The discovery of counterfeit fractional notes has attracted widespread attention in society. The responsible issuing bank should not turn a deaf ear and remain silent about whether they are genuine or counterfeit. Although the points raised by Pingming News Agency can distinguish between genuine and counterfeit notes, the above-mentioned 1-cent note seems to still be questionable. It is hoped that the bank will provide an accurate statement to know what to do. (Junmei)

### Grain Prices: Foreign Rice Soars Due to Zhao's Assessment, Unscrupulous Merchants Remain Unsubdued... Though Foreign Rice Arrives, Surge Continues, New Shipments Arrive Gradually... Transportation Relies Solely on Bicycles

Yesterday, the market for foreign rice was relatively firm. Trading started actively, followed by customers from inland villages competing for purchases. In an instant, all prices reached parity. With the market lacking room for adjustment, many bullish traders were still planning to absorb large quantities, employing a strategy of deliberate suppression followed by advancement to confuse the market. Consequently, the situation became increasingly chaotic. Rumors suggested that closing prices, while ostensibly adhering to limits, were secretly circumventing them, with actual transactions exceeding official rates by one or two yuan. There were also reports of No. 1 Saigon parboiled rice being traded off-exchange at 63 or 64 yuan. Many parties had fueled the market with Vietnamese rumors since morning, and cargo owners became reluctant to sell at lower prices. The market was also enlivened by speculative activity from Shantou and other inland groups, showing a vigorous atmosphere. However, due to the continuation of price limits and a reduction of five cents on smaller bags, formal trading was largely limited to substituting inferior goods for superior ones. For example, original packages from the British-Chinese Company, with a limit price of 70 yuan, were only formally traded at 65 yuan, while the black market saw deals of 300 to 400 tons at 72 or 73 yuan. The total volume of foreign rice traded openly and secretly yesterday reached 13,000 to 14,000 bags, mostly acquired by hoarders.

Amidst this large-scale manipulation by rice merchants, significant shipments of foreign rice continued to arrive in Shanghai. The Wah Lun Shipping Company's Da Pu vessel arrived yesterday morning from Saigon, carrying 25,982 bags of foreign rice, and docked at the Hongxing Wharf in Pudong for unloading. (Ancestor)

Over 1,000 bags of domestic Japonica and glutinous rice arrived yesterday. Amidst this chaotic situation, both open and black market trading were reportedly extremely volatile. Cargo owners hoarded and demanded high prices, while customers blindly sought supplies, causing prices to surge by one or two yuan. Original packages mostly exceeded the 70 yuan mark. Specifically, common ordinary white Japonica rice from Changzhou was 74 yuan, exceptionally clear Japonica rice reached 76 yuan, Wuxi clear Japonica rice was 73 or 74 yuan, Changzhou Su Kun Japonica rice was 72 or 73 yuan, and lower grades were around 70 yuan. Green husk thin rice was 72 yuan, original packages of early rice from Nangang were 71.5 yuan, and husked rice was 68 yuan. As for glutinous rice, Jin Li special grade was 68 or 69 yuan, Dan cargo was 66 or 67 yuan, similar to Hong Kong glutinous rice.

New Japonica rice continued to arrive from Zhoupu, listed for the 35th time. However, supplies were limited as they were mainly transported by bicycle, amounting to only eight *dan*. The quality was better than the new Japonica rice from Zhoupu. It coincided with the soaring prices of other goods, the limited supply was insufficient to meet demand, and the price opened at 68 yuan. New Japonica rice from Zhoupu also sold well, opening at 67 or 68 yuan, a significant increase of one or two yuan. Although new pointed rice from Taicang continued to arrive, the inconvenient inland transportation meant that only small amounts could be transported by bicycle, making them sell quickly. Only twelve *dan* arrived, opening at 64 yuan.

### Flour Market Remains Tight, Fuxin and Fufeng Supply Only Half

Flour: Yesterday, the market for spot flour continued to be tight. Following Fufeng Mill's reduction in supply by half, Fuxin Mill also reduced its supply. While factory prices remained unchanged, returned goods were sold at 15.20 yuan. At the same time, Sanxin Mill also restricted the supply of spot flour. Although the price was only 14.50 yuan, there was a shortage of goods for purchase. Therefore, hoarding of Phoenix brand flour in October was quite active, with the price rising from 15.20 yuan to 15.28 yuan, and 5,000 to 6,000 bags were traded. Foreign flour and inland firm varieties did not open.

Wheat: Yesterday's trading remained unremarkable. Due to the poor quality of raw materials, Chinese mills not only reduced supply but also tried to purchase wheat as much as possible. However, it was difficult to bring wheat into the concession, so even with price increases, there was no significant amount available. Yesterday, 400 to 500 bags of wheat were collected from Jiading Luodian, with the highest price at 25 yuan, and medium grades at 24.50 to 24 yuan. Japanese mills continued to be stringent in their purchases, mostly directly allocating goods, and the price was still only around 21 yuan. In reality, these were all prices for delivery to the mills, with no formal market.

### Bonds: Fluctuations in Domestic Debt, Conflicting Rumors

The over-the-counter market for bonds initially saw a decline of 30 to 50 cents due to excessive short selling, but then rebounded. In the afternoon, there was a sudden surge, with Class C bonds exceeding 4 yuan and Class A bonds surpassing 3 yuan, trending upward. The market was rife with rumors, both positive and negative. Some said that Song Ziwen had obtained a loan of 100 million US dollars from the United States, while others said that Ambassador Cole's visit to Chongqing was related to peace talks. Others said that there were problems with the French Concession, or that the situation in Haiphong was becoming tense. The rumors were unreliable, but with extremely loose credit, the bond market was not easily underestimated. During yesterday's market activity, the morning started weak but then gained momentum. Class C bonds reached a high of 54.10 yuan, and other types also reached new highs. The largest buyers were Companies 16 and Tong Kang. Lianhe, Dahua, Shuntai, Xiehe and Yuan all had substantial purchases. Hongda and Jiufeng had considerable sales. Tiansheng, Xinchang, Lianyi, and Dayuan also had sales. As a result, Class A and C were slightly lower, Class D and E continued to rise, and Class B was flat. The total transaction volume was estimated to be over 1.5 million yuan. A summary table is provided below:

Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
Class A National Bonds | 63.10 | 62.70 | 62.90 | Down 0.05
Class B National Bonds | 57.425 | 57.00 | 57.20 | Flat
Class C National Bonds | 54.10 | 51.35 | 53.75 | Down 0.05
Class D National Bonds | 52.80 | 52.70 | 52.80 | Up 0.20
Class E National Bonds | 53.85 | 53.25 | 53.60 | Up 0.10

Stock Trading: 45 shares of Zhonghua Book Company were traded at a price of 30.01 yuan per share.

Yesterday, the stock market fluctuated. The opening trend was weak, but then rose slightly. However, due to excessive profit-taking, firm prices could not be maintained for long, and the closing trend softened again. Rubber stocks were again subject to selling pressure, but prices remained relatively good.

London, 3rd (Tuesday) Dispatch: Today, company stock quotations remained flat. Only HSBC shares continued to improve, with UK-registered shares rising another £3 to £67, and Hong Kong-registered shares also rising £2 to £71. Exchange rates were unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Fluctuates

The yarn market continued to rise, but with fluctuations changing several times a day, it is conceivable that traders are also uncertain. In fact, the rise in gold prices and the continued contraction of foreign exchange have spurred buying, but actual business is still affected by blockades on various routes, making large-scale development difficult. Therefore, when the rise is severe, those who profit will sell off, and the market will loosen. When foreign exchange tightens, buyers will follow. Judging from this situation, the current market has completely become speculative.

The spot yarn market opened calmly in the morning, with 20-count Double Horse yarn priced at 1,025 yuan. It soon fell to 1,017 yuan. Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange market opened tighter and gold prices soared, suddenly exciting people and causing buying to surge to 1,038, 1,039, and 1,040 yuan. A small number of deals were made. Upon hearing that foreign exchange had eased, the price quickly fell to 1,030 yuan. After closing, it was impossible to sell at 1,030 yuan. According to half-day transaction statistics, 10,945 bales were traded, with 20-count Double Horse yarn rising by 8 yuan. Today, 2,180 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount of yarn purchased by various groups is listed below:

Same Trade: 2,680 Bales | Hong Kong: 255
Ningbo: 10 Bales | Total: 2,945 Bales

### Japanese Merchants Purchase New Cotton, US and Indian Cotton Markets Active

The spot cotton trade was weaker than yesterday, but market sentiment remained tight. Factory demand has not yet materialized, but it is much easier for Japanese merchants to obtain and use removal permits when purchasing new cotton.

According to other news, the international cotton market in New York was quite active, and the spot market was also very lively. At the same time, due to the good prices of stocks on Wall Street, the cotton market was very firm. As a result, closing prices rose by seven or eight points compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market initially rose yesterday due to some short covering, and then there were widespread rumors that the British government had ordered 5,831,700 burlap sacks in India to be filled with sand for air defense purposes, causing the cotton market to soar. As a result, including forecasts, the market rose by a massive 14 rupees compared to yesterday.

International cotton trading in Shanghai has been quite lively recently. However, due to the limited inventory in the market, prices are quite high, and traders are unwilling to show samples, because everyone knows the difficulty of ordering and transporting international cotton. Under these circumstances, cotton prices will rise day by day.

### Coal: Large Quantities of Vietnamese Coal En Route, Tongdeli Coal Arrives with Over 6,000 Tons

Amidst the blockade of Vietnam, white coal from there is en route in large quantities and will arrive successively. Yesterday, it was reported that a certain firm had just received 6,250 tons of Tongdeli white coal, which was being unloaded at the dock, causing a stir in the soaring market, slightly calming the market and reassuring people. The black market is said to be declining.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: New Western Sea Cucumber Arrives, First Batch Sold

A new batch of Western red jade sea cucumber has arrived, with a full range of grades. The first batch has already been sold, as detailed below. The prices are as follows: Luzon-produced jade: 359 to 361 yuan; No. 1: 337 to 343 yuan; No. 2: 333 to 339 yuan; No. 3: 293 to 317 yuan; No. 4: 273 to 295 yuan; Longya selected strips jade: 500 yuan; Produced jade: 480 yuan; No. 1: 470 yuan; No. 2: 457 yuan; No. 3: 440 yuan; Medium jade: 402 yuan; Makassar selected strips: 470 to 486 yuan; No. 1: 444 to 417 to 411 yuan; No. 2: 373 to 404 to 430 yuan; No. 3: 356 to 379 to 402 yuan; No. 4: 333 to 341 to 378 yuan; No. 5: 328 to 338 to 357 yuan; Small jade: 227 to 277 to 280 yuan; Xianda Port produced jade: 465 yuan; No. 1: 436 yuan; Large No. 2: 416 yuan; No. 2: 398 yuan; No. 3: 379 yuan; No. 4: 369 yuan. In total, current prices are higher than the previous market, with the top three grades of jade sea cucumber increasing by nearly 100 yuan, and the next grades increasing by about 20 to 50 yuan, while the increase in red sea cucumber is only slightly noticeable.

After the Jiangnan Provincial Examination, the practice of raiding banquets has been prevalent for a long time. The reason for this is that when rural areas hired servants for the examinations, in addition to providing supplies, all the equipment should be taken back by those who were responsible. However, servants and followers often took the opportunity to seize items, so it was necessary to send more staff to wait nearby. As soon as the banquet was over, they would immediately collect the items. At this time, with many people and hands, the servants still inevitably seized items by force, hence the name "banquet raid." Initially, they were afraid of official investigation, but as the excuses for raiding became more and more rampant, the practice has been perpetuated. Up to now, even before the banquet guests have risen, seven or eight hands, with bared teeth and brandished claws, already surround the area, waiting to strike. As soon as the diners stand up, fingers reach down to grab items from the table, overturning soup and clanging bowls and cups. In a very short time, the table is completely empty, even before the officials have stood firmly. It is not known that the Deer Cry Banquet is the court's intention to honor the worthy, and the ceremony is grand and important. Therefore, when the banquet was held on the 30th of last month, Military Commissioner Shen deeply hated this long-standing custom and issued a strict prohibition in advance, stating that anyone who continued to follow the old ways and raided the banquet would be punished according to military law. The banquet was moved to the examination hall, and orders were given to the magistrates of the upper and lower Jiang counties to guard the gates, and no unauthorized persons were allowed to enter. Therefore, on that day, there were a total of eight scholars attending the banquet, and all the rituals were carried out in an orderly and measured manner, unlike the perfunctory manner of previous examinations.

### Can't Live Anymore

-- Wan Jiachun

Because I am quite busy with life, I have no chance for leisurely strolls. However, I leave early and return late every day, and due to my job, I often run around on the streets (or rather, walk quickly). Although my feet are tired, I treat it as a stroll, so my steps become lighter.

I originally treated all walking as a stroll. As I walked, I saw six corpses wrapped in straw mats in a row, which greatly diminished my interest in strolling. But I did not reduce my courage to face reality: continuing to slip past my feet was a middle-aged woman. She sat on the ground, holding a child in her arms, with another lying beside her, crying, "Mom: I want to eat sesame cake!" The woman only stared blankly at the four words "Can't live anymore" written in chalk on the pavement.

This hasty stroll had already reached the end of Route Père Robert. Many children and passersby raised their heads to look at a window on the third floor. I also stopped to watch; I saw a foreigner standing by the window, pinching two fingers and throwing golden coins (probably coins for "slot machines") onto the road. The children scrambled to grab them, and the more they scrambled, the more he threw. Seeing a car pass by, he threw out even larger batches. I realized that this building was the clubhouse of some foreign soldiers, and that foreigners, in addition to drinking, dancing, and making merry, were now taking the lives of poor Chinese children to amuse themselves!

Walking on the crowded streets, I often encountered people distributing drug advertisements. As anyone walked past them, leaflets would be handed from their fingers, rustling softly, very pleasant to hear. If one was greedy for small gains and wanted to take an advertisement paper back to start a coal stove, and accepted it, then they would ask you to buy a package of drugs. At this time, they would surround you, and you would have to buy it. The drugs you bought were more expensive than in pharmacies. These rustling sounds also solved the livelihood of a small number of people.

The sun was setting in the west, and I was about to go home. As I "strolled" to Guizhou Road, a pair of delicate jade hands suddenly encircled my neck, accompanied by a melodious voice: "Spend three dimes and go sit and relax for a while!" She did not specify where to "sit" with three dimes, but I was determined not to go. So I said: I haven't had dinner yet, let's go sit in a while! "No, no, you won't come later." But I gently took her by surprise and slipped into a store. ... After talking with the boss for a while, it suddenly started raining. The "wild chickens" on the street all turned into drowned chickens. I thought of what had just happened and asked the boss: "They probably don't get many customers, right?" The boss replied: "No! They always get one or two every day." I also asked, "Each customer only spends two or three dimes, right!" He answered: "Hmph! At least seven or eight dollars, maybe they'll "go white and cold" if they have money in their pocket." "Uh!" - But what do they get from selling their flesh, these poor creatures!

### The Headmistress

-- Pei Ling

There is a small school in our alley, the headmaster of which died early, and now the headmistress continues.

This headmistress, according to our landlady, is "uneducated." I'm afraid even she herself can't explain what this means. But in fact, her four sons all graduated from that small school, and the youngest, Mao Mao, is now in the third grade, so they have all received the "educational influence" of the headmistress. The so-called "uneducated" probably refers to not having property.

She certainly doesn't have much property, even if she has a small school, it is just an alley school. The courtyard is used as a playground, and the box room is used as the administrative office. The house is small, but she tries hard to attract business: so that six students share one table. Recently, she added a kindergarten in the kitchen, so "although the sparrow is small," it is "fully equipped." Speaking of which, the headmistress should be given the most credit.

Because we have a dozen children studying there, she considers them her "big customers," so during the summer vacation, she often comes to play, and when enough people gather, they play mahjong at the landlord's house. After eight rounds, the headmistress pushed the tiles: "How about this? Headmistress Xu, you won 18,000, consider it Mao Feng's tuition!"

"Okay, okay." Headmistress Xu is also happy to have one less expense.

After mahjong, they start chatting, and the headmistress asks:

"What was drawn in the lottery last night?"

"Hanyun;" Headmistress Wang was regretting forgetting to bet.

"Oh; really Hanyun? I dreamed of a cow the night before, and I was born in the year of the ox, why didn't I bet on Hanyun?" The headmistress recalled her dream the night before. She thought, if she had won, she could have set up a scholarship!"

As I put down my pen, the headmistress called out again:

"Headmistress Wang, how about four rounds?"

Note: "Hanyun" is one of the thirty-six doors of the flower society, said to be "ox spirit"

Huo Sang Detective Story

### The Dancer's Fate

-- Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Six Dangerous Experiences

Huo Sang continued: "I increased the speed of the car, chased it to within ten yards of the car in front, and then followed the speed ahead, keeping a distance. The car passed Guizhou Road, Xizang Road, and then went west all the way to Xuhui Road, without stopping along the way. Near the end of Xuhui Road, it suddenly turned around. Fortunately, I was quick-eyed and quickly turned into a side road, avoiding his line of sight. Guess where he stopped the car after he drove back east?"

I replied, "But did he still return to the Astor House Hotel?"

Huo Sang glanced at me suddenly and nodded. "That's right, Bao Lang, your reasoning ability is indeed good. He still lives in the Astor House."

"Then, do you already know his room number?"

Huo Sang frowned suddenly and sighed slightly. "No, that's what I call the failure point. Because his car stopped at the west side entrance of the Astor House, he got out of the car and walked into the Astor House. Of course, I followed. At that time, I had already temporarily disguised myself, and my coat was also in the car. When he walked into the western elevator hall, I could have caught up to enter. But because I was too careful, I was afraid of being seen through, so I didn't dare to take the same elevator with him. I had no choice but to wait in front of the phone room. When the elevator came back down, I rushed in to ask the driver. Although the driver had a slight impression of the previous guest, he was not very clear. He said that the man with the beard seemed to have gotten off the elevator on the fifth floor. I believe that this person really lives on the fifth floor, or at least is in the Astor House. So I plan to come back and discuss it with Jin Shou, and then go to find out his real room number."

Ni Jinshou made a suspicious sound: "He wouldn't go up from one elevator and down from another, using a snake's sloughing method to sell you out, would he?"

Huo Sang shook his head and said, "No, I was very careful when I followed him in the car and never aroused his suspicion. Even if he saw me and wanted to sell me out, he could have found other opportunities when the car was circling around. Why return to the Astor House? You always know that criminals often abide by the saying: "The scene of the crime is the best hiding place." He must think this location is very safe."

"Do you believe he won't move away again?"

"No, he believes that I have been shot and does not know that I have followed him. Moreover, when I left the hotel, the 80844 car also drove away. I think he may not leave the hotel for a while." (97)

### Changed

-- Fengzi

Friend, I can call you friend now, because you are right, we have indeed "changed." Although it has only been three short years, I have deeply experienced the taste of life. In this great city's melting pot, I see the seeds of evil flourishing in every dark corner, I hear the oppressed people groaning under the low pressure. At the same time, as I gradually see through the bottom of this beautiful city, I also see the shocking flames of war of the invaders. The continuous sound of gunfire! It still seems to be echoing in my ears. Friend, if at this time, I no longer "change"! Could I still be considered a "Chinese youth"?

The past is like a terrible nightmare, and I have thrown it away without any nostalgia. Now, I can no longer silently endure: this reality made of iron and blood has taught me how to resist. Friend, my "change" is by no means a miracle, just like your "change."

"Change," this blessable "change"! It has not only "changed" our two weak youths into such tough ones, it has not only "changed" many other youths into the vanguards of the country and the pillars of society, but also will cause more people to "change" in the future. Yes, in this great era, we should "change" from a parasite into a fierce tiger, we should "change" from a piece of waste into a boulder. Friend, even our country is gradually "changing" from weak to strong! So, let us be pioneers of "change"!

### The Wasting of Life

— Zhou Wu

I took some time to visit an old classmate who has already entered the workforce, asking what he does for amusement in his free time. He shook his head, shrugged his shoulders, and said, "Nothing much! Sitting, sleeping, going out to play when I feel like it."

I was momentarily speechless, truly feeling sorry for such a young man. But the most regrettable thing is that in this era, countless young people are wasting precious time just like my friend, which is truly the wasting of life!

Many young people, after entering the workforce, consider their job duties as something they ought to do, while they squander and fritter away their free time; they think of this as the "rest" they deserve after work. They may all be dreaming of a great future, hoping for significant career development, but their actions contradict their aspirations.

After entering the workforce, one should certainly work extraordinarily hard and do one's best in their duties, but even so, at best, one is merely a capable and diligent clerk. If one hopes for development and promotion, one should use one's spare time outside of office hours to improve and enrich oneself. Adequate rest after work is necessary, but the remaining time should be well-utilized to achieve one's aspirations. Simply "sitting," "sleeping," and "playing" when one is free—isn't this just gradually wasting one's precious life?

I remember a famous saying: "We often curse the brevity of life, but our actions are as if life is endless!"

And perhaps those young people who are wasting their lives each have lofty ambitions, but they think of heading east while walking west. I deeply hope they can awaken and stop being wasters of life.

Entertainment World

### Tokyo Dancers Change Profession to Tailors

— Hua Zhi

The entertainment industry in Tokyo has been very depressed since the "Sino-Japanese War." Recently, the "anti-entertainment movement" has intensified, with all entertainment businesses, such as movies, horse racing, pachinko, and even reading pornographic movie magazines, being restricted. Furthermore, all dance halls are scheduled to close on October 1st. The general dance performers suddenly feel the panic of unemployment.

Investigations reveal that the dance halls in Tokyo have undergone several eliminations over the years, and only eight remain: "Teito," "Kyobashi," "Florida," "Union," "Izumibashi," "Nichibei," "Kowa," and "Ginza," employing 360 dancers and 109 musicians. Their situation was already not good, merely enough to make a living. Many of them intended to follow the example of their predecessors and seek alternative routes in China, but thinking that the better positions have already been taken, they have hesitated to act.

However, according to a manager of a Ginza dance hall, the future of Tokyo dancers is not entirely pessimistic. Some of them are taking precautions and have already learned sewing techniques, and will soon change their profession to tailoring; others plan to work as hostesses in bars to become skilled. As for the unemployed musicians, because jazz music will also be strictly prohibited, it will not be easy for them to find suitable outlets.

### Wu Suqiu Comes to Shanghai to Perform Again

— Plum Blossom Hall Master

Wu Suqiu and her troupe, hired by the Gengxin Stage, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning aboard the Shengjing liner. Suqiu has brought more than twenty supporting actors this time. Brief biographies of each member are listed below:

Chi Shigong: Plays male roles. He is the eldest grandson of the old actor Chi Zijun. A graduate of the "Shi" class of the Fuliancheng Opera School, he is talented and young. When I went to Beijing last autumn, I watched his plays several times and considered him a promising talent. However, due to the weather at that time, his foundation was insufficient, so his pronunciation was not yet perfect. At the beginning of spring, I received a letter from my friend Ha Shaohuang from Beijing, stating that Shigong's voice had gradually developed since entering spring, possessing high, wide, and low tones. After performing various plays such as "Silang Visits His Mother," "Empty City Stratagem," "Catching and Releasing Cao," and "Zhu Lian Zhai," the audience unanimously praised him, and there were many articles of praise in the newspapers. Mr. Ha is skilled at discussing plays, so what he says is credible.

Chuan Dewei: A graduate of the first class of the Chinese Opera School, specializing in martial arts roles. He has profound skills and extensive repertoire, with a standard appearance and bearing. After graduating, he has performed in various troupes, assisting Wu Suqiu the most often. I have watched his plays "Changban Slope" and "Evil Tiger Village." His elaborate and simple martial arts performances were satisfactory. His talent can be compared with Yang Shengchun.

Li Debin: Plays young male roles, also a graduate of the Opera School. He is excellent in civil plays and has a foundation in martial arts. Plays such as "Exploring the Village," "Zhenzhou," "Yaguan Tower," and "Linjiang Meeting" are particularly wonderful. He came south with Xin Yanqiu last time, and the audience unanimously praised him, saying that among the rising young male actors, Debin is the only one who is proficient in both civil and martial arts. This statement is certainly not exaggerated. My friend Yu Zhenfei also said that Debin's martial arts young male plays are currently considered the best in the Liyuan world.

Guan Dexian: Also a graduate of the first class of the Opera School, specializing in the bearded male roles. He has a wide repertoire and beautiful talent. After graduating, he ended up as a supporting actor, which is a pity. I have seen many of Dexian's plays, with "Chunxiang's Uproar at School" as Chen Zuiliang, "Silang Visits His Mother" as Yang Yanzhao, "Zhu Lian Zhai" as Cheng Jingsi, and "Yu Tang Chun" as Liu Bingyi being the most satisfying. He has worked with Wu Suqiu for the longest time and is particularly familiar with her small plays. Suqiu's bringing him along this time is a wise decision.

Jia Duocai: A master of comic female roles, especially skilled at playing old women. This person has come to Shanghai several times, and the people of Shanghai are familiar with him. The female lead Wang Xiuwen is a rising talent, but I have not seen her in person. In addition, there is also a supporting male role, Hong Deyou, who also graduated from the Opera School. The play "Jinsha Beach" is Deyou's masterpiece.

### Zhou Xinfang's Condition

According to Wu Xingzai, the owner of the Carlton Hotel, speaking to a reporter from the Haixing News Agency: President Zhou Xinfang of the Yifeng Society has not improved, even if he recovers within a few days, he will still need a considerable period of rest. To maintain the troupe's livelihood, they may invite Gao Baisui and Wang Xichun to take the lead and perform first. As for Zhang Yipeng substituting for Xinfang, it is probably impossible.

### The Sale of the Great Shanghai Theater is Completed

Confirmed news: It has been said for some time that the Great Shanghai Theater, directly under the Rongrong Company, would be sold. After two months of deliberation, it has become a reality. The buyer is the Xingyi Company. The price is 510,000 national currency. A deposit of 10% has been paid today, and the transfer will take place in one month. The owner of Xingyi is Yan Chuntang. From now on, the public screenings of Yihua's new films will no longer suffer from being squeezed out. The Great Shanghai's magnificent architecture is second to none among the five national film first-run theaters.

### About "The Female Emperor"

— Yongzi

Yihua's new film "The Female Emperor" can be considered one of the major films of the year. It is also the first film for Nan Guo Film Queen Li Qinian after coming to Shanghai. There is no doubt that it will be a great success. "The Female Emperor" is not an ordinary film. The story tells a historical fact during the Five Barbarian Invasions of China. It is based on historical research and is not the usual unofficial history. The Yihua Propaganda Department distributed copies of the story of "The Female Emperor" to the press and cultural circles at home and abroad yesterday, showing how serious Yihua is about producing "The Female Emperor."

After a month of production, the film will be completed in five or six days. Yihua also plans to hire several experts to conduct a rigorous review and will pay special attention to editing. "The Female Emperor" will be a miracle in the art world and will leave a glorious page in the history of Chinese cinema.

### Louise Rainer

— Shawi

Louise Rainer, the actress who laid the foundation for her fame with "The Great Ziegfeld," has won several "Oscar" awards and has hundreds of thousands of fans. She is a very popular movie star. Since her "The Great Waltz," "The Good Earth," and "The Toy Wife" met us, news about her seems to have been very quiet. Until recently, I heard that a new film had arrived in Shanghai, tentatively translated as "The Parisian Virgin."

It is said that Louise's background is not very good. Before she became famous, she often worried about having enough to eat, so when she played those poor girls in the movies, she was more realistic than others.

And because she comes from a poor background, she is very sympathetic to the suffering of poor people and often helps them with what she can afford.

For this reason, some people say that she is a Communist, and some even say that she is a Communist, so she often plays ordinary people in her films. If that is really the case, it is very wrong. Aren't the roles that Louise plays assigned to her by the film company?

She stepped onto the stage at the age of sixteen. At first, she didn't want to be on the screen until she saw a famous film starring Helen Hayes, and became interested in it, and signed a contract with MGM. When she first arrived in Hollywood (Louise was originally Austrian), her English was not very good, so she hired a teacher there to make her English fluent before appearing on the screen.

She is indeed a very good actor among the stars of Hollywood. She once said, "To be an actor, his or her skin must be as thick as rubber," which can express her past inner pain and can also be said to be her secret to success. As for her award-winning works, they are "The Great Ziegfeld" and "The Good Earth."
