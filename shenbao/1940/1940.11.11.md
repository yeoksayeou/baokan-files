### China Loses a Good Friend, Piddock Dies of Illness Yesterday, Former British Prime Minister Chamberlain Also Passes Away

Reno, Nevada: Senator Piddock, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and one of China's most loyal friends, passed away at 11:30 this morning at Washoe County General Hospital due to heart disease. This famous Democratic senator's advocacy for China and the embargo against Japan is well known throughout the country. This 68-year-old senator was admitted to the hospital the night before last, after his Republican opponent, Pollard, failed in the congressional election and he was re-elected. This Nevada Democrat was placed in an oxygen room after feeling heart discomfort yesterday, but ultimately succumbed to the illness. Piddock became Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1933. Before serving as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he had many accomplishments regarding the silver issue. Because of his involvement in the silver plan, he was naturally a person of great interest in the eyes of the Chinese government, as China had long relied on the United States to purchase Chinese silver. At that time, he was elected as a senator. At that time, there was Senator Nixon, whose term was to expire on March 7, 1917, but Nixon resigned before the end of his term, and his vacancy was filled by Piddock. Since then, Piddock has been repeatedly elected. Piddock's father was William Bradford Piddock, and his mother was Catherine Piddock. He was taught by private tutors in his childhood, and later attended Southwestern Presbyterian University, Washington University, and Nevada University, eventually earning a doctorate in literature. In 1892, he began practicing law in Seattle, but his adventurous spirit was very strong. In 1897, he joined a group going to Klondike, Alaska to mine gold. In 1928, he served as Chairman of the Democratic Party's platform proposal committee at the Democratic National Convention and was nominated by the convention as the Democratic Party's candidate for president. On March 9, 1933, he became Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. On June 12 of the same year, he was appointed by the US President as the American representative to the London Monetary and Economic Conference. He fought for the silver plan for 30 years and achieved success in both the London Conference and the Senate plenary session. This career of his made him familiar to silver-using countries in the East, feeling that he was more familiar than any other American senator. His reputation in the Far East was expanded by his support for Philippine independence. Chamberlain, former Prime Minister of Britain, has passed away last night, at the age of 71. According to his doctor, Chamberlain was quite calm when in danger. (United Press International, 10th)

London: Former Prime Minister Chamberlain passed away last night at his country villa at the age of 71. He was born on March 18, 1869. His father and brother were both politicians. After studying at Rugby and Mason College, he transferred to the business world, going to the Bahamas for seven years before returning to England. He then served in the Birmingham City Council, serving as Chairman of the City Planning Committee. In 1915, he became Mayor of Birmingham. In the 1918 general election, he was elected as a member of Parliament. For the first four years, he was quite unknown. On the 18th, he succeeded Baldwin as Prime Minister, at a time when the international situation was already quite tense. He insisted on prudence in diplomatic events. In order to prevent the expansion of the Spanish Civil War, he tried his best to improve relations with Germany and Italy. Foreign Minister Eden expressed his dissatisfaction with this and resigned immediately. He appointed Halifax as Foreign Minister. The Anglo-Italian Agreement was signed in Rome on April 16, 1938. In September 1938, he flew to Germany three times due to the Sudetenland incident to prevent Hitler from using troops against Czechoslovakia. Finally, on the 30th of that month, the Munich Agreement was signed by Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and other countries, with Britain and France guaranteeing the border of Czechoslovakia from aggression. He and Hitler also signed a declaration that Germany and Britain would never go to war.

Washington: According to news obtained from diplomatic circles here, the United States may obtain naval and air bases on the east and west coasts of Mexico to resolve some of the general political and economic relations between the two countries. If the United States can enjoy special base privileges in Veracruz and Acapulco to make the defense of the Panama Canal stronger, military strategists in the country will certainly welcome it. US Undersecretary of State Welles and Mexican Ambassador to the United States Najera have discussed important disputes between the two countries several times to seek complete solutions to benefit Pan-American unity and Western Hemisphere defense. Welles also discussed with Roosevelt for a long time. Welles said that he did not hear about the proposal of Mexico's bases. However, diplomatic circles know that Washington officials and Mexico City are considering a general solution, which includes the following: (1) The United States leases several base locations on one or two coasts from Mexico, on the condition that Mexico's sovereignty in the leased area is not damaged. (2) The rent paid by the United States must provide Mexico with sufficient US dollar foreign exchange, with a surplus after repaying the long-sought purchase price of farmland from the United States. (3) After Camacho took office as President of Mexico, he published a statement announcing the reopening of negotiations between Mexico and Shell Oil Company and Mobil Oil Company to resolve the demands arising from the requisition of their properties in Mexico. (4) The income obtained from leasing the bases to the United States is used by Mexico to pay to the two oil companies. If the difference is determined to be made up for with oil, then it is made up for with oil. (International News, 10th)

Piddock was the chairman of the Senate Silver Committee. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, his actions had made the Chinese people recognize him as the most sympathetic to China's resistance. He advocated adopting a strong embargo plan to resist Japan and also supported Congress authorizing the president to declare a ban on the shipment of all raw materials to Japan. He firmly supported the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, under which China benefited greatly from the US government's purchase of silver. He openly endorsed Britain's war with Germany and Italy, and he was also in an important active position regarding the implementation of the US National Defense Program and the expansion of US aid to Britain. As the chairman of the Internal Affairs Committee, his words and actions were sufficient to influence the entire committee, enabling the committee to tend to adopt plans that were beneficial to China and Britain. He was born on September 19, 1872, in Vicksburg, Mississippi. In 1912, he went to mining with commoners. Piddock served as a common miner for two years and then became a member of a certain political system committee in Alaska. In 1900, he married Ms. Mims. In January 1902, he returned to Tonopah, Nevada. At that time, in addition to engaging in activities to become a senator, he did not hope to hold any public office. In 1912, he was elected as a senator, filling the seat of Senator Nixon, who did not complete his term. Subsequently, on November 6, 1916, 1922, and 1934, he was re-elected. From 1913 to 1917, he served as the secretary of the Senate Democratic Party primary election committee. At the Democratic National Conventions of the 66th, 67th, 68th, 69th, 70th, and 72nd sessions, he was the temporary secretary of the conference for electing candidates for president. In 1924, as the secretary of the platform and proposal committee of the Democratic National Convention, he was the main person responsible for the establishment of the party. When he attended the London Economic Conference in June 1933, most of the negotiations were about international agreements to promote the restoration of normalcy in the silver industry. Mexico, the world's leading silver-producing country, has permanently engraved this fact in its heart and has set up a silver festival to commemorate this Nevada senator. In the 72nd plenary session of the Congress, the matters he managed included the American-Cuban treaty, the Pan-American treaty, the American-Mexican treaty, and the non-aggression treaty concluded by the United States with Argentine Foreign Minister Lamas. The above treaties have been approved. People in the Senate recognize him as a clever tactician, because every time he achieves his wishes, it is based on clever techniques, not on the pressure of speeches. (United Press International, 10th)

Chamberlain

London: Advocated for the appeasement policy, which was criticized by the world. Before resigning from the Privy Council, he joined the government as Postmaster General after the collapse of the coalition government led by Lloyd George. Because of his rich financial knowledge, he was transferred to the post of Minister of Finance in 1923, but before he could present the budget, the Conservative government had already failed. The Baldwin cabinet was established at the end of 1924, and he served as Minister of Health, with considerable achievements, until his resignation in 1929. In 1931, the first national government was established. His father served as Minister of Health, but in October of that year, he was transferred to Minister of Finance. In May 1937, Hitler unexpectedly violated his promise and annexed Czechoslovakia. In January 1939, he and Foreign Minister Halifax went to Rome to meet with Mussolini to discuss non-interference in the Western War and the tense relations between Italy and France. On September 1 of the same year, Germany began to invade Poland. In order to fulfill its promise to Poland, Britain declared war on Germany on the 3rd. After the outbreak of the war, he reported on the war situation in the House of Commons from time to time, attended the Supreme Military Conference, and personally went to the front to congratulate the British Expeditionary Force, until his resignation. After Churchill succeeded as Prime Minister, he served as Lord President of the Council, and later resigned due to illness. (Reuters, 10th)

### US and Mexico Conduct Negotiations

Regarding the suggestion of land, nothing was heard. However, diplomatic circles knew that Washington officials and Mexican officials were considering a general solution, which included the following: (1) The United States leased several base locations on one or two coasts from Mexico, on the condition that Mexico's sovereignty in the leased area was not damaged. (2) The rent paid by the United States must provide Mexico with sufficient US dollar foreign exchange, with a surplus after repaying the long-sought purchase price of farmland from the United States.

### The Chronic Problem of the Thai-Vietnamese Dispute

According to news in recent days: the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, which has lasted for two months, has recently become increasingly worse; both sides' defense forces have been moving to the border, the national border has been sealed off, and small-scale clashes have occurred. According to unconfirmed reports: Japanese troops in Vietnam are currently negotiating with Thailand about stationing troops or passing through, and Japanese representative to Vietnam Kakuta protested to Vietnamese Governor Decoux on the 2nd of this month about the "anti-Japanese" trend in Saigon. Combining the above situations, it is enough to show that a new crisis is brewing in the South Asian situation, and the Thai-Vietnamese dispute is like a fatal cancer among them.

This "dispute" began to be exposed on September 13, just when the Japanese-Vietnamese negotiations were protracted and unresolved, and the Japanese side mobilized its forces to implement coercion against French Vietnam: The Thai side suddenly submitted a note to the French Minister to Thailand, requesting three things: 1. Define the deepest part of the Mekong River as the national border, and implement the return of the 43 small islands of lost Thai land that France had agreed to cede to the Thai side; 2. Define the area of ​​Luang Prabang and part of North Sa where Thai people live to Thailand; 3. If the French government is unable to rule Vietnam, the Thai government requests the return of the land of Laos that was lost in the past. The Thai side also stated that if the French-Vietnamese authorities do not give a satisfactory answer, they will abandon the Franco-Thai Non-Aggression Pact concluded on June 12 of this year. At that time, French-Vietnam was suffering from dealing with Japanese demands, and only had the ability to deal with Thailand perfunctorily and delay, while the Thai side was aggressive and threatened with war preparations. It was not until the Japanese-Vietnamese negotiations came to a temporary end that the Vichy side submitted a reply on October 14, rejecting the Thai side's territorial demands based on the provisions of the 1907 treaty between the two countries regarding avoiding the submission of any new territorial demands, and stated that it would approve the non-aggression treaty with Thailand, but agreed to establish a mixed commission in accordance with the provisions of the non-aggression treaty to resolve the Mekong River issue. The anti-French-Vietnamese mass movement of the Thai side reached a heated state in mid-October. Recently, French military commander in Vietnam General Martin resigned and returned home, and he was invited by the Thai Prime Minister to travel to Bangkok to meet with him on his return journey, which seemed to be a side use of the Thai side to seek a solution; and because the French side's minister to Thailand advocated accepting the Thai side's demands, he was ordered to return home, which again showed the French attitude of firmness, with little room for concession. Although Vichy special envoy Calon recently went to Bangkok for contact and expressed optimism, but looking at the development in recent days, there is no sign of any solution. At a time when the situation in the South Pacific is becoming increasingly tense, the long-term lack of resolution of this dispute is a great misfortune for France, Vietnam, Thailand, and all countries that have close interests in South Asia; only those who attempt to profit from it fear that the world will not be in chaos. Looking at the so-called Indochina Peninsula, although it is divided into three parts: Vietnam, Siam, and Burma, its area is only one million square kilometers, but the ethnic differences and historical complexities are by no means simpler than the Baltic Sea coast or the Balkan Peninsula in Europe; and the evolution of the separation and combination of the countries and the succession of territorial affiliations are difficult even for historians to understand; therefore, it is difficult to judge the fundamental right and wrong of the disputes about this territorial issue: This is never an appropriate time to resolve such historical disputes when the Far East is full of crises. The Thai people's concept of never forgetting lost land is originally worthy of sympathy, but the cession of this territory is now nearly forty years ago, and there have been previous statements to France that there will be no more territorial demands, but recently, it suddenly regards this as a problem that can no longer be tolerated, and insists on immediately achieving the goal of restoring the land, which is naturally due to the Thai government's vigorous implementation of nationalist policies, and the "friendly country" that has been deeply associated with Thailand for many years is exerting pressure on French Vietnam, and even if the Thai land demands on French Vietnam are instigated by its "friendly country," it will inevitably receive its strong support to echo it and coerce French Vietnam to fulfill its great desire to encompass Vietnam. Therefore, the objective task played by Thailand here is similar to that of Poland and Hungary in the Sudetenland negotiations, and Thailand's own situation and its future are very similar to Poland's in those days. Frankly speaking, the Thai side is of course not completely unaware of the current crisis-ridden situation, such as the recent Thai special envoy group went to Japan for contact, and it is reported that "the affairs it is engaged in have achieved excellent results"; but at the same time, the Thai Minister of Justice led another delegation of five people to visit British Malaya and Burma, India, and Australia to promote their goodwill mission, and the separate contact between the two delegations and Britain and Japan is enough to show the painstaking efforts of the Thai authorities to re-establish a new balance between Japan and the Central Government on the Indochina Peninsula after the defeat of France. For example, the news that Thailand planned to join the Three-Power Alliance, and the rumor that the Japanese army used Thai territory to attack the Burma Road, were immediately denied by the Thai authorities, expressing their neutral stance. By analogy, it is enough to show that even if the so-called Japanese army intends to station troops or pass through Thailand, the Thai side may not easily agree to it for its own safety. But if the current dispute with French Vietnam persists, or even turns to war, then third parties will inevitably take further action on the pretext of the "New Order in East Asia"; this view has been publicly touted in a certain newspaper some time ago. Therefore, Thailand's insistence on land demands proves to be extremely unwise.

From another point of view, the French-Vietnamese authorities' maintenance of the integrity of Vietnam's territorial sovereignty has completely succumbed to the strong beams, and they have resolutely rejected the Thai side's relatively reasonable demands, which is undoubtedly to convince the Thai people. At present, in addition to hoping that both the Thai and French sides can understand the great difficulties in the future, rein in the horse on the cliff, make concessions to each other, and do not go too far, it is also hoped that both sides will try to arbitrate so that the sparks of the stars will not eventually lead to a prairie fire.

### Japanese Troops Retreating South on Yongqin Road Heavily Attacked by Chinese Army, Part of the Remaining Japanese Troops Cover the Retreat, Japanese Aircraft Escort Japanese Military Officers

Nanning: After the Chinese army conquered important strongholds south of Pingleqiao on the Yongqin Road, a part of the remaining Japanese troops occupied Height 25 and are trying to cover the retreat. The Chinese army is taking advantage of the victory to launch a fierce attack. (10th)

Hong Kong: According to the war report of the Chinese Command in Liuzhou, the Japanese army, which has been retreating south along the Yongqin Highway from Nanning since November 1, has encountered Chinese guerrillas on the southern border of the Shiwan Mountains. The war in other stars is still going on. A large number of Japanese aircraft are now escorting the retreating Japanese army and officials loyal to Nanjing. Japanese aircraft bombed the villagers, claiming that they were all guerrillas, but at night, the real guerrillas rose up to attack the retreating Japanese army, and the Chinese mobile troops also engaged in battle with the Japanese army. It is reported that more than 100 Japanese soldiers were killed and many were injured. According to Japanese sources, Japanese aircraft bombed the Chinese army advancing towards Nanning on October 25 and 27, which proves that the Japanese army's retreat from Nanning was due to the Chinese army's pressure from north to south. Two divisions of the Guangdong army participated in the counterattack against Nanning, most of whom had participated in the Battle of the Longhai Railway and had fought on the front line in Jiangxi under the command of General Li Hanhun. They are now under the command of General Zhang Fakui, Commander-in-Chief of Guangxi. People here believe that the Japanese army withdrawing from Nanning may first be transferred to Hainan Island for a short rest and then transferred abroad for service. However, senior Chinese generals in Shaoguan predict that these Japanese troops may return to Guangdong and advance with Xu Guan (transliteration). A small number of Japanese troops, who have participated in many battles, may be repatriated to Japan. (International News Service, 10th)

Athens: A large number of Italian soldiers surrounded in the Pindus Mountains were under intense pressure from the Greek army last night and are rapidly retreating. It has been confirmed that these Italian troops are Mussolini's famous "Puma Division," with approximately 15,000 men. Their commander and hundreds of soldiers have been captured by the Greek side, and the complete annihilation of the entire army is not far off. Italian reinforcements have launched three desperate attacks to rescue the surrounded Italian troops, but all have been repelled by the Greek army. At the same time, Italian forces, under the cover of dive bombers and artillery, have repeatedly attacked Greek positions near Ioannina. (International News Agency Report on the 10th)

Budapest: The Greek radio station broadcast last night that the Greek army repelled the Italian army's attacks from Florina and Korçë yesterday, achieving a great victory in the area. It is said that thousands of Italian soldiers, including officers, have been captured by the Greek army. It is also said that Italian forces at certain data points have been "completely defeated" by the Greek army, and the Greek army has captured countless artillery pieces and other vehicles. The radio station also stated that countless Italian soldiers in certain war zones abandoned their weapons and fled due to the overwhelming firepower of the Greek artillery. Yesterday's victory has put the Greek army in an unprecedentedly advantageous position in the war. (United Press Report on the 10th)

Change of Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Front

Italy Uses Paratroopers for the First Time to Rescue Surrounded Italian Troops in Mountain Areas

Ohrid: According to late-arriving news from the border, Italian forces in the mountains of Korçë used paratroopers for the first time. It is reported that their purpose was twofold: one to rescue the trapped Italian troops in the mountains, and the other to deliver new orders from the highest Italian authorities. According to news, Italian commander General Badoglio has arrived in a certain zone on the Greek front. Badoglio is a highly respected commander who was previously summoned by Mussolini to lead the three armies in Albania. On the Greek side, a mechanized force departed from Bikelishta yesterday morning and joined another column departing from Progai, unexpectedly launching a surprise attack on the Italian forces in the Qiaoboke Mountains. It is reported that the Italian division has been cut off. In the Kurvelesh area of southern Albania, 300 Albanian soldiers loyal to Greece ambushed an Italian motorcycle team near Savini Village on Friday night. The Italian team had a total of 40 men, and seven were killed. It is reported that the Greek army recaptured Grabush Village yesterday, capturing 55 Italian soldiers, including three officers. The Greek army also seized a large amount of ammunition and machine guns. Italian aircraft bombed Ioannina and three small villages to the west on Friday night, causing significant loss of life and property. (United Press Report on the 10th)

Greece Completes National Mobilization: 500,000 Troops Defend Against the Enemy

London: A Reuters correspondent in Greece reports that Greece's mobilization is now complete, with 500,000 troops engaged in defense. The Greek military authorities are very satisfied with this achievement in the first half-month since the outbreak of the war. So far, those in contact on the battlefield have been Greek outposts and a larger number of Italian troops who lack the will to fight. It is now expected that there will not be a major battle before next week. The Italian army has made slight progress on the main Greek defense line only in Western Epirus, but the Greek defense line there was not originally planned to defend the basin. The Greek army's advance and retreat are entirely in accordance with strategic plans. The Greek outposts in the Florina area have improved their position by capturing a plateau, which can control Koriça and its important transportation lines. More than 2,000 Italian Alpine soldiers were captured when they broke into the core defense line. Although the Greek air force is small in number, it is very brave in combat. Together with the land-based anti-aircraft artillery and British aircraft, it has made remarkable achievements. Currently, the ratio of air force losses between the two sides is nine Italian to one British/Greek. Italian aircraft now dare not fly low to directly attack any military targets.

### German Authorities Consider Evacuating Nationals from Greece: Continued Italian Defeats Damage Axis Prestige; May Assist in Attacking Greece to Reverse the Decline

Thessaloniki: German authorities have proposed that all German nationals in Greece leave the country. No reason has been officially given for the departure, but observers generally believe that this is a prelude to the Nazi Party assisting Italy in attacking Greece. The slow progress of the Italian attack on Greece has already greatly damaged the reputation of the Axis powers' blitzkrieg. Therefore, observers have long speculated that Hitler will assist Italy in order to restore the credibility of the Axis powers. (United Press Report on the 10th)

### British Convoy Attacked: Minor Losses; British Admiralty Issues Statement

London: The British Admiralty has issued a statement refuting the German headquarters' claim that German naval raiders destroyed a British convoy of 86,000 tons in the North Atlantic, saying that on November 5th, a British ship team was attacked by a surface enemy raider. It can now be said that many British ships escaped safely, but the remaining details are not yet known due to the need to maintain radio silence. Another Admiralty statement said that according to the report of the British submarine "Catfish," while patrolling the sea and ambushing coastal enemy ships, it saw two enemy supply ships and attacked and destroyed them. A third naval report said that two enemy Junkers dive bombers that attacked ships in the Thames Estuary on Friday were destroyed by the fire of the British ship "Winchester." At that time, one British 900-ton empty ship was sunk by enemy aircraft, and another merchant ship of 2,700 tons was injured but remained safely in port. No other British ships were damaged. The British submarine H49 is overdue and may have been lost. (Reuters Report on the 10th)

### Canadian Mail Ship "Empress of Japan" Reported Bombed

New York: According to unconfirmed news from Japan, the 26,000-ton "Empress of Japan" of the Changxing Shipping Company was bombed in the North Atlantic, and the ship was damaged and unable to sail. The ship, which regularly travels between the Far East and Vancouver, is well known in the Far East. (Reuters Report on the 10th)

Stockholm: According to news from New York, a Japanese ship received a distress signal from the "Empress of Britain," which has a displacement of 26,032 tons. Therefore, it is generally believed that the 25,000-ton merchant ship mentioned in the German war report as having been hit by a bomb may be the "Empress of Japan," but it is still difficult to determine.

### Free French Troops Land in Gabon, French Congo: "Battle of Dakar Port" Re-enacted; French Submarine Scuttled Itself

Vichy: Outside the major Atlantic port of Libreville in French Congo, a second "Battle of Dakar Port" reportedly re-enacted last night, as the "Free French Expeditionary Force," protected by British warships, landed near the city on the African coast. The Vichy government's colonial ministry announced that troops belonging to General de Gaulle have landed in the Gabon region of the Congo, part of Equatorial Africa. The landing force was "covered by a light fleet." Although the battle is underway, the details have not been learned. Government circles expressed extreme tension over the outcome of General de Gaulle's forces' battle with the French colonies in Africa loyal to the Vichy government, as this is the second attempt by the Free French to occupy the French colonies loyal to the Vichy government in Africa by force. The first attempt to land at Dakar Port was unsuccessful. The British government said that the British and "Free French" forces did not want to fight the French, so they retreated as soon as they encountered resistance. However, British newspapers have heavily criticized this move as a "major failure of Dakar Port." (International News Agency Report on the 10th)

London: According to news from Brazzaville, Africa, the Vichy government's submarine Poncelet scuttled itself near Gabon port yesterday when the Free French forces arrived. There was no war between the two sides, and all the crew members were rescued. It is reported that the Free French forces are currently patrolling the area around Libreville. Of all the ports in French Equatorial Africa that are still under the control of the Vichy government, only Libreville remains. The Admiralty issued a statement denying reports that British warships shelled Libreville, saying that the Vichy government's announcement that the British fleet shelled Libreville and assisted the Free French forces in landing was completely untrue. The only action related to the British fleet was to resist the French submarine Poncelet's attempt to sink a British ship without warning. The submarine surfaced and scuttled itself after the British fleet took retaliatory action. (Reuters Report on the 10th)

### Young Reveals Japanese Secrets in US Speech: Friction Between Army and Navy; Difficulties in Invading China; German-Japanese Treaty Cannot Last

Washington: Mr. Young, a foreign reporter who had been stationed in Tokyo for many years, sent news that the Japanese army was dissatisfied with to the United States, resulting in him being imprisoned for 61 days. Young said in a speech to the public in Baltimore yesterday that Japan is afraid of the United States and the Soviet Union, and Japan is not a threat to the United States. The so-called new order in Japan is just a new stench, with the smell of bombing, bribery, speculation, and narcotics. Some people think that Japan is united, but this is not the case. What makes up this complex Japan are five warlords, two major political parties, a newspaper with good sales and a tendency toward democracy, a public that expresses resentment, and merchants who are kept to support the war. Young also said that the Japanese police have fourth-rate knowledge. They arrest you and want to know what you are thinking. If you do not express your thoughts, they detain you for continued interrogation. If you express your thoughts, they will detain you for six months or a year. Young spoke about German-Japanese trade relations, saying that Germany and Japan are deceiving each other and do not trust each other. Even if there is a treaty, it will not last. Young also detailed the friction between the Japanese army and navy and the difficulties in Japan's war against China, saying that many Chinese leaders, if they could save face, would like to clean up the mess and return to their country as soon as possible, because China will never surrender to Japan. Young praised the work of US Ambassador to Japan Grew, saying that the position of ambassador to Japan is extremely difficult. Grew maintained his position as an envoy and resisted the public. He is a first-rate person. Young also described to the audience the situation of his 61 days in a Tokyo prison. (Reuters Report on the 10th)

### British Air Force Displays Power: Bombing German and Italian Territories, Munich in Flames Reaching the Sky, Italian Industrial Areas Suffer Major Damage

London - On Friday night and Saturday morning, British Air Force bombers bombed the railway transportation center of Munich, destroying railway lines, hitting locomotive depots, and starting a large fire in the marshalling yard. The British Air Force's attack on this one target was perhaps the most intense. The attack began shortly after 8:30 p.m. British planes dropped high-explosive and incendiary bombs on the four-mile-long marshalling yard and railway workshops in batches, as dense as raindrops, lasting for two hours. The workshop is the nerve center of Bavaria's extensive electrified railway network. The British planes took off from England, traveled 600 miles to reach Munich. The weather conditions were extremely suitable for bombing, with the bright moonlight quickly finding the tracks, and then dropping bombs. Within minutes, multiple explosions and fires were seen, spreading and burning fiercely. During the first hour of the British air raid, the crisscrossing tracks near the main station, both ends of the six workshops, and long rows of locomotive depots were hit by heavy bombs. Several nearby buildings were damaged by the force of the explosions. When the British bomber crews arrived over Augsburg afterwards, they saw the flames of Munich reaching the sky. On Friday night, British aircraft activity was not limited to long-range attacks and large-scale bombing of Munich, but also bombed many important targets in Germany and the occupied territories. For example, an oil refinery in Gelsenkirchen in the Ruhr area was attacked. Within two minutes of the first batch of bombs being dropped, several explosions were seen, flashes of white light, followed by a large fire extending 1,500 yards. Two hours later, another oil refinery in the area was hit. Oil depots on the south bank of the Rhine near Frankfurt, and extensive railway targets in Germany, as well as freight yards in Hamm and Cologne, were all heavily bombed. The main railway line outside Saarbrücken was hit, starting a large fire. Buildings near railway sidings in Stuttgart were also hit and exploded. Many other industrial targets were heavily bombed. British aircraft made a low-altitude attack on a large factory in Ulm, seeing it catch fire and billowing smoke. An hour later, a British bomber, on its way back, passed over the area again and saw the large fire still burning. Another large factory near Überlingen on Lake Constance was bombed and damaged. The Siemens-Schuckert plant in Nuremberg was subjected to an hour of intense bombing by British aircraft. When British aircraft attacked the inland port of Duisburg, bombs hit the dock area, and explosions occurred among the ships next to the docks. On the same night, British aircraft launched separate attacks, bombing or strafing twenty enemy airfields. A bomb hit an aircraft hangar at the Tübingen airfield. After the bombing of the airfield in Aust in the Netherlands, smoke rose to a height of 8,000 feet, indicating that the oil depots had been hit and were on fire. When British aircraft attacked the Deelen airfield, they flew low and used machine-gun fire to extinguish the lights, and heavily bombed an enemy plane about to take off. Enemy coastal bases that were attacked at night included Amsterdam, Harlingen, and Vlissingen. A large fire broke out in the Vlissingen shipyard. Harlingen was bombed twice, with bombs hitting ships and buildings. A batch of bombs landed on the nearby railway yard, causing a violent explosion, the force of which greatly shook the British aircraft in the sky. Also on Friday night, a Coastal Command Blenheim bomber heavily bombed Lorient, which had already been severely damaged. The British aircraft flew intermittently to attack, and with clear visibility, finding the targets was not difficult. The bombs dropped hit the docks and naval shipyards, causing successive explosions. (Reuters, 10th)

### British Isles Continue to Suffer Air Raids, Axis Powers Threaten to Retaliate Against Britain

Rome - Italian journalist Gayda stated yesterday in "Italian News" that since British planes are bombing Italian civilians, the Italian Air Force will retaliate, taking the same measures against Britain and its allies. (Haitong Telegram, 10th)

### Full Text of Hitler's Speech (Continued)

Re-arming, I then resolved that unless Germany had not a single soldier, Germany would be at the forefront of the world. I made thorough preparations. Seven million Germans have thus returned to work. The German currency has thus been stabilized. Everyone's life is full. Output has surged. Everything is done according to the principles laid down by the National Socialist Party. The most effective thing in economics is the talent for work and organization. The foundation of the German currency is not gold but production. One day, Churchill will be gone, but Germany will have countless submarines. Churchill's use of the Air Force to fight against the people is the greatest fool in the military world. The air force used by Britain and its bases are the weakest weapons of Britain, and the external environment in terms of geography is also the worst. The German position extends from northern Norway to the coast of Spain. Churchill's use of the Air Force to fight against civilians will never destroy the morale of the German people. In terms of soldiers, we do not need to use reserves. Today's German military appearance is very different from the First World War. Whether it is the navy, army, air force or its weapons, it cannot be compared with 1914. The ammunition we consume is only the amount produced in one month, so the ammunition in storage is extremely large. I had no choice but to order a halt to manufacturing. Have you heard threatening words? The population of Australia, including aborigines, is only six or seven million, but they exaggerated that they would build eight times as many German aircraft. Canada, with only nine million people, will build twelve times as many German aircraft. In terms of US production, it cannot be described with astronomical figures. Regarding this level, I do not want to compete with others.

Industrial Mobilization But there is one thing I can tell you, that is, Germany's output will be the largest in the world, because today the strength we can mobilize is not only Germany, but almost the whole of Europe. I want to develop this strength in the industrial area. You can believe it. For several years, we have been preparing for industrial mobilization, but large-scale production will have to wait for a year or two. We are preparing for the future. In terms of material and personnel preparation, we are constantly improving the world's most distinctive military institution, waiting for the opportunity to strike and achieve the same great results as before. At that time, those who conquer the world with words will encounter our military force. Germany and its allies, in any case, are sufficient to cope with any united force in the world. No force can defeat our force. Our peacetime preparations have now borne fruit. Our four-year plan has now been extended for another four years, which will give us unlimited supplies. This plan makes any blockade a failure. Please see who will be blockaded, us or the enemy? Half a year ago, Churchill said, "We have destroyed half of the enemy's submarines, and after a few months, what the enemy has left will be reduced to 30% and 10%." This lie is not worth arguing about. Now the world has recognized that our submarines are increasing day by day, and the enemy has no way of knowing where they come from. We still have to fight against the liars of international capitalism. There will come a day when Churchill will lose his existence, and the submarines of the Soviet Union will appear there.

Launching the Air Force Implementing the air force strategy is Churchill's ideal. In fact, the strength of the British Air Force is weaker than our country. You all know that I suggested to the world several years ago that we should stop the air force from bombing, allowing it to bomb civilians, but Britain went its own way. However, I still strive not to fight against civilians. As in the Polish War, I did not carry out night raids on Polish cities, but only bombed their military targets during the day. Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, France - in the previous battles, German aircraft only targeted military equipment. British Prime Minister Churchill, after the British Air Force failed to intrude into Germany during the day, suddenly carried out night raids, bombing German civilians. I quietly watched enemy planes bombing civilians in the Rhine area for eight days. After the end of the Western Front battles, I once again expressed my attitude to Britain, but Germany suffered more and more bombings. Halifax has become like a crazy person. The bombing became more and more intense every day, but I still held a wait-and-see attitude. Many of my colleagues asked me how long I would tolerate it. They would never stop automatically. After watching quietly for three months, I could no longer tolerate it, so one day I issued the following order: Britain needs bombing. Britain wants to destroy Germany with air warfare. I have now decided to treat others in the same way.

Belief in Victory See who will be destroyed. Churchill made this great mistake in the military, which cannot be done by soldiers. Although I am not the strongest person in Germany in decades or even hundreds of years, I absolutely believe in my success and firmly believe that this war will achieve the same results in Germany as my struggle in the country. I participated in the previous World War and suffered the deception of the victors, so the end of this war will not be the same as the previous one. This is my unwavering determination.

Exaggerated War Achievements When I addressed you last year, the German army had just begun to fight Poland. As a result, the Polish army collapsed in just eighteen days. At first, other countries thought that the German-Polish war could last for six months or even ten months. The combat power of the German army would be exhausted. During this period, the Western Front could reorganize its army and prepare for war. In the summer of 1940, the Allied forces of Britain and France on the Western Front could take the path of the Netherlands and Belgium and directly advance towards the Ruhr border, gradually controlling Germany's fate. They also predicted that a revolution would occur in Germany. In short, they have been intimidating people with threats for many years, thinking that Germany is also a jackal of the same tribe, but they do not know that Germany has already made full preparations. On November 8 last year, the German army conquered Poland, proving that the enemy's first prediction was not accurate. At the same time, it proved the success of Germany. Today, I have several achievements that can be reported. The German army not only destroyed the enemy in the West in a few weeks, but also occupied part of Norway. It can be said that there is a strong and united front from Kirkenes to the Spanish border. The hopes of the British who are fond of boasting can be said to be completely shattered. They tried to cut off Germany's important transportation lines and gradually starve Germany to death. Unexpectedly, the opposite is true. After Europe understands its own interests, it gradually mobilizes to fight against the enemies of Europe. In a few months, Germany made Europe free. Britain tried to make Europe Balkanized. This plan cannot now be realized. In other words, what Britain wants is to divide or destroy the organization of Europe, while what Germany and Italy want is to organize Europe.

Struggling to the End If Britain wants to say "the war must continue," I also think it doesn't matter, because the war can only continue until we end the war. You can believe that we have the certainty to end the war and achieve victory. In addition, I cannot but say that I do not intend to make predictions. Why? If I had announced to the British on January 1 this year, "(1) The German army will enter Norway, and Britain will not be able to stand in Norway, (2) This summer the British will not be able to live in the Netherlands or come to the Netherlands, and the Germans will occupy it, (3) Belgium and France will be completely changed or no longer exist," the British would unanimously scold me for being a lunatic. Therefore, I still adhere to the policy of not making predictions, and only intend to tell the German people that the war has created unprecedented results. Judging from the number of people killed in this war, the mortality rate is lower than that of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, only half of the number of those killed at that time. When Chamberlain made a peace proposal to me in Munich in 1938, he had already decided to declare immediately after returning to Britain, "I have gained considerable time, and we can expand our military to attack Germany." We know very well that the current truce is only a truce. They may hope that after a few years, I will no longer be the German head of state and can launch another war. Therefore, my unchangeable determination will be to continue fighting and achieve a clear decision. They need war, and the German people will fight to the end.

Seeking to Achieve the Goal The crisis of reopening the war in a year or two must be eliminated. The German people must live in peace. This peace will allow them to work and not allow international thugs to instigate other countries to fight against Germany and use war as a strategy for profit. I am not fighting for material interests. I think that war is dangerous and costly, wasting our time and working ability. If we can continue to work, I will be very happy. National Socialism has produced the spirit of German military victory. psychological. The pre-conditions of morality and material. The current German army is a revolutionary army. German soldiers not only remember the past Germany, but also yearn for the future Germany. They fight to realize a better Germany and complete our national and social movement.

Remembering the Martyrs

Germany's current achievements are all thanks to those who started the uprising in 1923 and those who sacrificed. They first shed blood for the National Socialist movement. In the following decade, domestic and foreign revolutionaries followed the sixteen martyrs and sacrificed hundreds of people for the country, and the struggles in Austria and the Sudetenland were magnificent. These struggles all originated on November 8 and 9, 1923. We sincerely commemorate the martyrs and realize the will of the martyrs. Germany will win the final victory in the current European war.

### When Japanese Troops Occupied Nanning, Foreign Missionaries' External Communications Were Cut Off, Letters, Books, Magazines, Etc. Were All Confiscated, French Bishop Did Not Know the Current Situation in France

Nanning - During the Japanese occupation of Nanning, pressure was exerted on foreign missionaries residing in the city. All contact with the outside world was strictly prohibited. All incoming and outgoing letters, telegrams, and various informative books and magazines were confiscated. When the Vietnam issue arose, the Japanese troops even regarded French Bishop Shen Shijie of the Catholic Church, Father Peng Junyi, and Tang Yuqiu as prisoners. When the Yunnan-Burma Road opened, they insulted British pastor Ou Xian Guang of the Gospel Church and British doctor Huang Jue Min of the church's affiliated hospital. For eleven months, their lives were like being in prison, and their movements were restricted. When the reporter visited Bishop Shen and talked about the French defeat and the invasion of Vietnam, he still knew nothing about it. He couldn't help but cry when he heard the news. According to reports, when the county seat fell, Mr. Shen sheltered 360 righteous people in the Catholic Church, and the pastor of Fuxiang Church also sheltered more than 130 people. Until the Chinese army entered the city, these righteous people still lived safely in the church. Their enthusiasm is admirable. (Telegram, 10th)

(A Glimpse of Nanning City After the Calamity)

In the imagination of the general reader, after eleven months and six days of trampling by iron hooves, after two destructions of artillery fire during the fall and recapture, and finally after the destruction and burning by the retreating Japanese, Nanning must be in a terrible state. At the same time, in the imagination of another group of readers, Nanning is the only big city in southern Guangxi. Under the long-term rule of the Japanese, it has become a large smuggling port. In order to ensure the dumping of its goods and to attract corrupt merchants, the Japanese would dress up the city like a flower, and anesthetize the obedient people as docile as cattle and sheep. Even when the Japanese withdrew, there was bound to be a mess. However, the centipede dies but does not fall, and even though the essence is damaged, the scene is still there. Therefore, in the imagination of the general reader, the recaptured Nanning must still be quite prosperous, and even if it is a bit deserted, it can be restored immediately. These two ideas are correct in common sense. The reporter and all other travelers had thought so before entering Nanning, thinking that it would not go beyond the above two points. But in fact, the current Nanning appeared in a third posture: emptiness, decay, and desolation, which is a fitting portrayal of this posture.

Yes, at any time, morning, noon, or dusk, when you walk through Zhongshan Road, Delin Road, Renai Road, and all other roads, you will not find a scene of rubble, let alone the atmosphere of prosperity. You can't even meet a dog or a cat. What you see are rows of tall or short, empty houses covered with inches of dust, and piles of garbage, swarms of flies and mosquitoes. If it is at night, you will also hear the chirping of insects and the mournful cries of birds. At this time, you will doubt that you are in a remote mountain wilderness. Almost all the damp ground that is open is covered with white flowers, and there are reeds that are one or two feet long. The doors of some tall courtyards are also completely open, and the inside is full of empty cans and scraps of paper. That is where the Japanese once lived.

It is not only empty, decayed, and desolate here. On some streets and in some residences, there is also terror. Because when people retreated, they buried a lot of landmines. In some places, they would deliberately play tricks, lifting a piece of floating soil on the ground and inserting an iron wire, causing you to have a dangerous panic. In some exquisite houses, they placed valuable food or other things, tempting people to take them. Facts have proved that there are indeed landmines in these places. A squad leader of a certain division found a house with biscuits piled up in the window. The window was tied, and the door was closed, but not locked. At this time, he became very witty, walked away more than ten steps, lay down on the ground, and used a long bamboo pole to push the door. With a bang, the door was blown to pieces, and the house was filled with smoke and biscuit fragments. He laughed, and then in two minutes, he picked up the biscuits in the house. These memorable foods must have been tasted. A female colleague even collected a package and prepared to send it back to her relatives and friends.

Now, a week after we entered the city, the situation has changed. The dirt and filth in the streets and courtyards have been partially cleaned. After the general search by the engineers, the words "(Danger cleared)" are written in white on the front of each house. Some shop signs are starting to be painted, and some are writing on the door panels that someone has returned, or asking someone to go home quickly, etc. These are all enthusiastic but poignant summons.

Nanning was a ghost world ten days ago, and a dead city a week ago. After the blood transfusion of thousands of male and female athletes, it has begun to recover. After December 28, except for the five hundred and ten righteous people who took refuge in the Catholic Church and the Gospel Church, there was no Chinese in the entire city. This is a phenomenon that no city occupied by the Japanese has experienced.

The Japanese expelled the citizens of Nanning City, and at the same time suffocated themselves. Because I couldn't find anything to eat in Nanning City. Due to the frequent illnesses of the soldiers, even if there was something, they didn't dare to eat it. Therefore, all food, even water, relied on overseas aid.

Where did the expelled citizens go? Is the so-called Japanese special rule to rule this city? It turns out that the Japanese have opened up another (new provincial capital). That place is Yingxin Market, thirteen kilometers northwest of Nanning. This place is not big, but it has become a substitute for Nanning, becoming the political and economic center of the Japanese rule of Nanning. All the citizens who were expelled from Nanning were imprisoned there for the Japanese to mock.

Yingxin Market is located on the north bank of the Yongjiang River, west of Yongwu Road, and parallel to Santang on Yongwu Road from east to west. There are more than a hundred civilian houses and two rows of houses in the market, forming a street. The market is surrounded by barbed wire. It is said that on his prosperous Daishan Street, everything is sold. Japanese goods are everywhere, and many corrupt merchants are smuggling, all of which are traded there. The armed forces under the wings of the Japanese are responsible for armed delivery.

Yingxin Market is the political and economic center of the Japanese in Nanning, then Nanning is the military center of the Japanese. In fact, it is so. After expelling the citizens, Nanning is only allowed to station troops and is not allowed to engage in any commerce. In the Nanning area, in addition to three or five Japanese-run restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and comfort stations for soldiers' entertainment, all Japanese merchants who operate businesses under military protection are limited to trading in Yingxin Market. (Of course, the digestion of Yingxin Market is terribly small, and it does not trust Nanning City. What does this mean? This means that after the failure of the Japanese plan to prosper Nanning City, they no longer attach importance to the marketability of the Guinan occupied area. This is also the economic factor behind the later withdrawal of the Japanese from the Guinan battlefield. (Central News Agency Telegram, 10th, Liu Zhuzhou)

Sexual Hygiene

### The Principles of Love Between Men and Women

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

The Flourishing of Reproductive Glands is of Utmost Importance

The principle of love between men and women can be said to stem from the physiological and psychological integration. If the development of the reproductive organs is incomplete, then sexual desire also lacks soundness. The purpose of the reproductive function is to allow the sperm of a man to combine with the egg of a woman to produce a new individual, and the principle of love between men and women lies therein. However, upon careful observation of humans, the development of sexual desire and reproductive organs is often not well-coordinated. Humans experience feelings of love and sexual desire long before their reproductive organs mature. Children whose reproductive organs have not yet matured frequently develop feelings of love for the opposite sex, which is evident. It is a strange phenomenon that children whose reproductive organs have not matured already know to love the opposite sex, so it is not surprising that children masturbate. However, this greatly affects their physical and mental health, as it is caused by engaging in sexual behavior before the reproductive organs have matured.

If one masturbates or indulges in excessive sexual activity during development, the reproductive glands will be greatly damaged, resulting in conditions such as spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation. Early marriage is also the same. Such people experience various problems in their proper sexual life, the common ones being premature ejaculation, impotence, and incomplete development. Consequently, harmonious marriages are often ruined. Therefore, one should practice restraint during development and avoid licentiousness. If you feel physically weak and your health level is low, you should supplement it with "Körpertonikum" (Body Tonic), a German reproductive gland hormone preparation for men. The ingredients of "Körpertonikum" are entirely extracted from the reproductive glands of animals, their essence extracted using scientific methods, and mixed with mineral and plant ingredients beneficial to the human body. It has the effects of nourishing the brain, blood, kidneys, and essence. If you are injured by masturbation, taking this preparation can restore your original strength, guaranteeing essence replenishment and kidney nourishment within 24 hours. The elderly who take this have the effect of rejuvenating. The women's "Körpertonikum" is a highly effective medicine for treating irregular menstruation, anemia, and premature aging, and is truly a treasure for health!

### Proven Treatment for Masturbation and Licentiousness

— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

Patient Ling Qichun, 25 years old, from Yibo, works in a hotel. (Self-report) Due to my weak willpower, I started masturbating at the age of seventeen, and it became a habit over time. Later, I experienced frequent spermatorrhea and a pale complexion. Later, I had an affair with a promiscuous woman from my hometown, which made my body even more battered. Although we have separated now, I have already contracted kidney deficiency and other illnesses. (Symptoms) Poor appetite, spermatorrhea three or four times a week, foggy mind, premature ejaculation, small local size. (Treatment) 15 minutes of electrotherapy daily, taking "Nervines Spermatorrhea Pills" to stop spermatorrhea, and actively purchasing and taking the testicular essence preparation "Körpertonikum" to nourish the deficiencies and treat neurasthenia and kidney deficiency. After taking it for a month, I felt refreshed, energetic, and the spermatorrhea had stopped. By the second month, my appetite had increased, my complexion was rosy, and premature ejaculation was gone. By the third month, all symptoms had disappeared. Upon checking my weight, I had gained nine pounds, and my erectile power was strong. Theoretically, I could stop taking it, but Mr. Ling, seeing the great nourishing power of "Körpertonikum," continued to take it to nourish his deficiencies. In total, he took it for half a year, and his weight reached 118 pounds. Mr. Ling weighed only 101 pounds before treatment.

### A Painful History of the European War (2) – The Great Tragedy of France

Since May 16th, the British military authorities had felt indignant towards the Allied Headquarters. When General Weygand took over, General Ironside, the British Chief of Staff, while expressing his acceptance, stated that the situation was serious and that he had to consider independent action to protect the British forces in the Flanders area. On May 20th, five German armored divisions and several mechanized divisions had crossed the Meuse River. At that time, General Ironside was returning to London from France, holding meetings with staff in the War Office. Several French military liaison officers sat on iron beds, next to General Ironside's desk, simply wanting to never leave the maps and telephones, even in their dreams. General Ironside's large leather boots were also placed at the foot of the bed, ready to be worn at any time. A map of Flanders was laid out on the table, with two photos placed on either side: one of Mrs. Ironside's beautiful portrait, and one of the general's beautiful young daughter. It was at this time and place that General Ironside decided to launch a major counter-offensive along the Somme River. The French officers nodded in agreement, and said that General Blanchard's mechanized division and part of the First Army could assist the attack on the left flank.

With no worries about the rear, the German army prepared to attack the Somme River front line without stopping for a moment. From the first day, Weygand called this battle "The Battle of France." On May 29th, at a cabinet meeting, he openly stated that the Battle of the Somme was the final battle, and that he was prepared to use all reserves and mobilize all manpower and material resources to make a desperate gamble. There could be no further retreat after this. Weygand explained to the ministers: "In modern warfare, a retreating army is a defeated army, because the pursuing army advances faster than the retreating army. Retreat cannot preserve weapons, nor can it maintain a continuous front line. In modern warfare, if you don't retreat, that's fine, but once you retreat, it's impossible to recover."

On June 1st, when Churchill flew to Paris to participate in the Allied Supreme Council, Weygand reiterated this statement. He pressured Churchill for greater assistance. On June 4th, Dunkirk fell, and at dawn that day, the German army's major offensive on the Somme River began.

On the first day, the French army was able to hold the entire line despite incredibly intense artillery fire. Weygand expressed satisfaction. Reynaud used "a glimmer of hope" as the title of his broadcast. On June 6th, most French people still believed that France would be able to recreate a miracle in history, stop the enemy, and achieve final victory.

At the same time, Reynaud eliminated all the weak elements in the cabinet, starting with Daladier. He promoted Baudouin to Foreign Minister, and appointed the fifty-year-old General Touchon as Minister of War. Baudouin was a behind-the-scenes figure with great potential influence, who had been involved in politics and business for fifty years without being tainted by the bad habits of the political world. General Touchon, on the other hand, had always been a believer in mechanized armored divisions and offensive air power, and had only been promoted to the rank of general twelve days prior.

However, after inspecting the front lines, General Weygand had devised another plan, on a grander scale, by which the Flanders army could perhaps be saved entirely. To this end, he had to mobilize all the reserves. When he heard that a portion of the troops he urgently needed had to assist Ironside's operational plan, and that French General Billotte had also agreed, he stamped his feet in anger, scolding Billotte for making a decision without authorization. At the same time, he declared to the British army that the French army had other uses and could not assist, and asked them not to attempt a lone attack. Unfortunately, it was too late, and the British army's offensive had already begun. This offensive was initially quite successful, but soon encountered strong resistance, and the British army was forced to retreat, even behind its original line.

On May 23rd, Billotte told King Leopold III of Belgium and British General Gort about Weygand's plan in Ypres. The plan stipulated that the French army would be in the north and the British army in the south, launching a joint attack on May 26th in order to cross the Somme River and re-establish contact between the British and French armies. Although this plan was extremely dangerous, it was probably the only way to save France. Unfortunately, General Billotte, who was responsible for commanding the northern campaign, died in a car accident on May 28th. On May 25th, the Belgian army also retreated from north to south, saying that they were being excessively pressured by the German army. Fearing complete isolation from its allies, the British army sent two divisions to occupy the border towns of Belgium in order to maintain contact with General Blanchard, who had replaced Billotte. Blanchard told Gort: "The Belgian army is preparing to retreat." Gort immediately informed Ironside. Ironside instructed Gort to "prepare on your own."

A few hours before the British and French armies began their counter-offensive, Belgium surrendered. At eight o'clock in the morning on May 28th, Reynaud reported briefly on the radio: "Leopold of Belgium first sought help from me, but now, in the midst of battle, he has surrendered to the enemy without a word to Britain and France. The road to Dunkirk is now wide open." The first batch of British troops began to withdraw from the Lys River, boarding ships between Ostend and Dunkirk. Unable to support itself, the French army also had to decide to find a way to board ships and withdraw. They abandoned all their guns, equipment, and even the mechanical equipment of the mechanized divisions.

An optimistic atmosphere continued until June 9th. During these few days, Reynaud sent his first urgent telegram to President Roosevelt, requesting American assistance. Weygand even declared in a military order: "The enemy has suffered heavy losses and is exhausted. Our army has reached the last quarter of an hour of the battle. Hold on!"

However, Weygand had exhausted all his resources, mobilizing troops from behind the Maginot Line, and disregarding the threat of the Italian army, mobilizing the front-line troops from the Alsace area. In total, he had only about forty divisions. The number of German troops, however, increased day by day, reaching more than one hundred divisions, concentrated on a one-hundred-mile-long front line. The German army had forty divisions on the Vas River side, ten divisions opposite Soissons, and forty divisions on the upper reaches of the Aisne River and in the Champagne area, not counting the armored divisions guarding the Siegfried Line and preparing to launch an offensive on the Swiss border.

Day and night, the French army defended against the German army without closing their eyes. The battle never ceased, and every morning they saw a fresh wave of German troops surging in. The French army finally collapsed. The German army broke through Abbeville, and the defending troops there, a Scottish division, the last British division stationed in France, also collapsed. In despair, Weygand attempted to build a new line of defense, but it was to no avail. He warned the government to leave Paris immediately. On the evening of June 9th, thousands of trucks moved important files from various departments. Government officials took their families with them. The vehicles snaked endlessly. Those who did not escape to Tours by car traveled by special train. Even the General Headquarters moved 120 miles to the south.

On June 10th, Reynaud accompanied Weygand to inspect the front lines. Two days later, these two military and political leaders returned to the General Headquarters in the village of Briare on the Loire River. They argued fiercely, and finally Weygand said: "Everything is over. We must stop the war immediately to avoid the worst possible outcome."

On June 11th, Italy declared war on France. But Mussolini's move no longer affected the course of events, and the French side was indifferent to it. On June 12th, Reynaud returned to Tours, refusing to compromise, saying, "The soul of France has not been extinguished!" He had a long talk with Pétain, trying to get him to be his comrade. But Pétain was even more determined than Weygand, saying: "Since there is no longer any hope militarily, we have no choice but to stop the war."

Reynaud picked up the phone and asked Churchill to come quickly, and at the same time convened a cabinet, holding an emergency meeting at the police station. The ministers looked flustered, anxious, and extraordinarily impatient. They shook hands with each other, and before they could finish their greetings, they rushed to talk to others. As the meeting began, bombs exploded all around Tours.

Reynaud announced to the cabinet that they would fight to the end at any cost. Mandel and General Touchon both expressed their support. Touchon even suggested moving the government to Brighton, so that "the French army could hold the line there, and there would be a way to the sea, so they could get overseas supplies." But no one agreed with this proposal. Navy Minister Campinchi and Aviation Minister Laurent-Eynac advocated moving to the North African colonies.

Before long, Pétain slowly stood up and said: "All these speeches are of no practical use. The time is past. The deeper the German army advances, the harsher the conditions will be. While our navy is still intact, part of the army has not yet collapsed, and the Maginot Line has not yet fallen, it is better to ask for a truce immediately. If we delay any longer, we will have to obey the victors in everything." Information Minister Frossard and Chautemps both agreed with Pétain's opinion, as did Baudouin.

In the midst of the discussion, it was suddenly reported that Churchill had arrived, and the meeting was temporarily interrupted. Churchill was shocked when he heard the report. He pleaded: "Hold on for another forty-eight hours. Tomorrow night, I will send a thousand bombers to help, and I will send troops and equipment as soon as possible." (Two nights later, five hundred British bombers did attack the German advance, but to no effect.)

Another meeting was held that night, presided over by President Lebrun himself. It was pitch black along the streets, and the refugees were crowded. The ministers sat in cars, driving windingly from Tours to the Château de Cangé, a few miles away, which was temporarily serving as the presidential residence. Weygand stepped into the meeting room, his face pale, his nerves agitated, and spoke in silence:

"Gentlemen, standing before you is a disgraced soldier, a defeated general. We have no choice but to surrender." When the French authorities heard this great man's call for an armistice, they felt the weight of their responsibilities and could not help but tremble in fear. Frossard even burst into tears, and the others were also tearful.

The meeting lasted all night, only deciding to declare Paris an open city, because even if they tried their best to defend it, it would only turn the famous city into scorched earth, and only stop the German army for a day or two. Soon, Tours was also threatened, and the government decided to relocate once again, moving to Bordeaux on June 14th, while the German army took Paris by surprise. (To be continued)

Tung Wah kicked off, and there were attacks and defenses on both sides. After eight minutes, Youliang kicked into the goal, Kehou headed it, and Tai caught it, dribbled a few steps, and shot fiercely, scoring a goal successfully! 1-0! Applause thunderously erupted from all four sides. The Portuguese merchants launched a fierce counterattack. Three minutes later, they actually came to the city walls. Li Ning, eager to rescue, fouled, resulting in a penalty kick. Unexpectedly, Tung Wah was blessed by the heavens, and Costa missed the shot, hitting the crossbar. Tung Wah narrowly escaped. Two minutes later, Huang Kehou passed to Wan Jin, who passed to Youliang, eventually reaching the feet of the strange-footed Li Yichen. With the distance so close, Su Ruo had no way to save it. The score increased to 2-0. In the first half, Tung Wah maintained a 2-0 lead.

(Cutting Through Three Barriers)

Continuing the battle, Guião launched a surprise attack, but fortunately it was unsuccessful. Not long after, Qin Bi Gao saved another dangerous shot. At that time, the Portuguese army surrounded the penalty area. Fortunately, Bi Gao defended strongly without losing. After 18 minutes of stalemate, Tai got a wonderful pass from Kehou, turned to the right, and shot from 30 yards outside the right corner, hitting the right corner of the goal with extreme clarity, to the delight of the spectators. Tung Wah thus cut through three barriers in a row. The Portuguese merchants counterattacked desperately, but fortunately no accidents occurred. Time flew by like an arrow. There were only two minutes left, hoping to reach the end safely, but unexpectedly, after Han Longhai kicked a corner kick, Plata kicked it at an excellent angle, causing it to hit the post and bounce into the net. Bi Gao was caught off guard, and the Portuguese merchants managed to pull back one goal, making it 1-2, thus avoiding total annihilation. After the kick-off in the center line, the whistle had already blown before long. Tung Wah won 3-1!

### Recent Developments in Soviet Sports - 26 World Weightlifting Records Created - Many New Swimming Records Also Created

(TASS) In weightlifting, there are a total of 35 world records, of which 26 were created by Soviet athletes. Germany accounts for 5 of the remaining 9, and the UK, France, Japan, and Egypt each account for 1. Weightlifting is extremely popular in the Soviet Union, with no fewer than 25,000 participants.

The Soviet women's lightweight sports meeting javelin champion achieved a score of 38.46 meters (TASS)

The Soviet summer sports have ended, and the final program was the Voroshilov cross-country race. Eleven years ago, only 126 people participated in this race, but currently the number of participants has reached 100,000, which is enough to show the speed of Soviet sports development. This year's cross-country race was 10 kilometers long, and the champion was Red Army soldier Fan Ning, with a score of 31 minutes and 24 seconds, breaking last year's record. Also, in the summer sports, Soviet athletes created a total of 39 national records and 2 European records (long jump 7.46 meters, pole vault 4.26 meters).

As for swimming, Bauzhengo broke the world record for the 200-meter breaststroke with a time of 2 minutes 33.7 seconds. Soviet swimmers also set a new world record in the 400-meter relay with a time of 3 minutes 57 seconds. In addition, Mashakov's 100-meter freestyle swim was 57.5 seconds, which athletes from various countries around the world have failed to break in the past few years.

Most of the outstanding Soviet athletes are Red Army personnel. They all excel in stamina, which is enough to prove their strength in prolonged battles. In 1937, five Red Army soldiers patrolled the Soviet border by bicycle, covering a distance of 30,878 kilometers in 268 days. Also, last summer, naval personnel traveled by rowing boat from Murmansk to Baku, crossing the White Sea and the Caspian Sea, a total distance of 5,600 kilometers, taking 38 days. In shooting, the Red Army created two world records, and in weightlifting, they repeatedly set ten world records. As for swimming, Red Army and naval personnel can enter the water in any climate and river. Bauzhengo's 100-meter breaststroke was 1 minute 6.8 seconds, and the 200-meter was 2 minutes 33.7 seconds, exceeding the records created by the American Huth and Kastleh.

### How to Adjust Wartime Finance

— Yu Xielin

To seek victory in war, it is necessary to first consolidate the domestic economy. The maintenance of industry, the promotion of trade, the sufficiency of finance, the management of funds, and the control of prices are all important strategies for the wartime economy. This is true for all countries in the world. However, to seek the effectiveness of the above policies, it is necessary to first seek the proper handling of financial measures. In the three years of our country's war, the government authorities have strived for stability in wartime finance, such as restricting withdrawals, handling discounts, improving local finance, reorganizing local trade, controlling foreign exchange, and promoting frugal savings. Encouraging financial institutions to lend to industry and commerce, organizing the Four Joint Offices, expanding the financial network, and restricting domestic remittances and managing bank funds, etc., the measures taken can be said to be detailed and appropriate. However, due to environmental factors, it has not been possible to fully exert its effectiveness and achieve the goal of financial stability.

The Pathological State of Our Country's Wartime Finance

Now, let's first discuss the difficulties in the financial control of our country's wartime: First, the financial organization is not yet perfect, such as the proliferation of small banks and the improper use of bank funds, so the authorities feel quite difficult to implement financial policies. Second, our country's financial institutions and industrial and commercial enterprises are concentrated in the coastal provinces. Since Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Hankou were successively abandoned, the government authorities have failed to directly and strictly control the financial institutions and floating capital there. Third, the rear is short of funds, resources have not yet been developed, and financial institutions have not yet been widely established. Although the government authorities have tried to remedy this by setting up branches of the National Bank and expanding the organization of the financial network, and encouraging the Shanghai Commercial Bank to add branches, the number of banks in the rear has increased sharply, but it is still difficult to achieve significant results in the short term in regulating the finance of the rear and developing the industry of the rear.

Our country's wartime finance is in such an environment, and naturally, it suffers from various pathological conditions. First, let's discuss the issue of floating capital. If social floating capital is not used for proper purposes, it will flood the market and cause great harm. Shanghai is in a situation of temporary peace, and the population has increased sharply, and funds have also concentrated accordingly. Since the European War, the flooding of floating capital in Shanghai has become even more prominent. The funds that escaped in the past have returned one after another, and funds from the Nanyang area have also flowed to Shanghai in large numbers. According to the Shanghai Bank's business report for the 28th year, from the outbreak of the European War to the end of last year, the funds flowing into Shanghai from Hong Kong alone reached a huge amount of 150 million yuan. From this, it can be seen that the number of funds coming to Shanghai is quite considerable. Furthermore, observing the business reports of various banks, time deposits have decreased while demand deposits have increased sharply. It can also be seen that the issue of floating capital in Shanghai has reached a serious stage. The abundance of floating capital is not a blessing for Shanghai's finance.

Now that Shanghai's floating capital has increased sharply, let's look at Shanghai's need for funds. The prosperous industrial and commercial area of ​​the Southeast has been devastated by the war, and only a corner of the concession remains. The investment of large enterprises in the past has suffered greatly. The industries that have fallen into enemy hands have all been controlled by the Japanese puppets. Therefore, the use of funds has been shrinking day by day. Even in the Shanghai concession, capitalists dare not invest in large enterprises to build large-scale factories because, in the current situation of temporary peace, future changes are still difficult to predict. Therefore, the industries that have been built after the war are all small-scale.

Shanghai's need for funds is less than before the war, but the concentration of funds is greater than before the war. Since funds have no normal channels to accommodate them, they flood the market and flow into speculation. Initially, the target of speculation was still foreign exchange and margin trading, which had already damaged the country's strength, but did not threaten the people's livelihood. Since the European War, the target of speculation has been extended to foreign stocks and goods. As for the hoarding of goods, it was initially limited to metals, cotton yarn, and medicines, etc., and later extended to general daily necessities of the people, such as rice, flour, and coal, etc. The price doubled in just a few days, and the impact on the people's livelihood can be imagined. Although speculators suffered a serious blow in mid-May, with considerable losses, speculation flourished again within a few months, and the hoarding of goods was even more rampant than before. This is really due to the lack of good outlets for floating capital.

In short, the abundance of floating capital and speculative hoarding not only harms the development of the national economy and increases the threat to the people's livelihood, but also affects the future of the war. Therefore, the pathological state of our country's wartime finance should be adjusted as soon as possible. I hope that the government authorities will continue to work hard. I will not hesitate to present a few points that should be reformed below, and I hope that knowledgeable people in the country will not hesitate to correct them.

To rationalize our country's wartime finance, nothing is better than first strengthening the organization of banks. At present, there are only a little over ten banks in our country that have strong capital and excellent credit. The rest of the banks have small capital and weak activity; or due to poor management, their credit is poor. Such banks are naturally unable to shoulder the heavy burden of wartime finance. Moreover, the deposits of banks are increasing rapidly in large banks, and there is still a phenomenon of outflow in small banks from time to time. The deposits of small banks are obtained by high interest rates. If they are now confused by speculation to gamble for a temporary fortune, why would they be willing to transfer capital to the rear? Speculation is a risky business, and if it unfortunately fails, it is bound to lead to bankruptcy. The development of the banking industry was originally intended to promote financial stability and national economic prosperity. Now, the proliferation of small banks is a deformed development, which instead disrupts finance and promotes the decline of the national economy. Therefore, bank mergers are an important task for our country's wartime finance. The benefits of mergers are as follows: First, after bank mergers, they will not be as scattered as they are now, and government management will naturally be easier. From this, the attitude of banks that have always been outwardly compliant but inwardly disobedient can be eliminated. Second, after bank mergers, the scale will be large and the credit will be strong, which can shoulder the heavy responsibility of wartime finance. Third, after bank mergers, the financial resources will be strong, which can help the authorities combat speculation and transfer capital to the rear. However, I believe that bank mergers do not mean merging all the banks in the country into one or two large banks to manipulate the country's finance, but merging those with similar nature to improve the organization of banks.

### Increase Deposit Interest Rates to Absorb Social

— Floating Capital

The deposit interest rates of our country's banks are already too high, with demand deposits above 4% and time deposits above 7%. In peacetime, the burden of banks is already too heavy. Moreover, at a time when deposits are increasing sharply and loans are decreasing, banks are in a state of distress for the use of deposits. Therefore, in order to reduce their own burden, there have recently been moves to reduce interest rates. From the perspective of the banks themselves, this seems to be reasonable, but from the perspective of the national economy, it is harmful and not beneficial. After the interest rate reduction, the impact on the psychology of depositors is quite large, which is enough to prompt depositors to urgently seek the use of funds and return the deposits in the bank to the market for speculative activities. Therefore, at the present time, it is unwise for banks to implement interest rate reductions, and it violates the measures for national financial stability. Compared with the high profits of speculation and deposit interest rates, even such high interest rates cannot help but feel small. Depositors are confused by speculation, so they have changed time deposits to demand deposits, and increased the liquidity of demand deposits. The business reports of various banks show that time deposits have decreased and demand deposits have increased, which is clear evidence. From this, it can be seen that although the deposit interest rates of our country's banks are high, they no longer have the ability to absorb social floating capital. At present, to stabilize floating capital, the only way is to increase deposit interest rates, so that demand deposits can weaken their circulation rate, and even a part of unnecessary demand deposits can be induced by high interest rates and return to time deposits. At present, foreign exchange is trending down, margin trading is falling, and commodity prices are stabilizing. General small speculators have felt that there is no profit to be made. This city is a good time to increase deposit interest rates to stabilize floating capital. If floating capital tends to stabilize, the speculation in the market can be greatly reduced. Recently, the newspaper reported that the Ministry of Finance issued an order to increase the interest rates of simple savings and national construction savings of the Four Banks. If it can be promoted nationwide, it will be the prelude to solving the problem of floating capital.

Managing Bank Funds

Our country's banks have developed abnormally under speculation. Before the legal currency system, the operating basis of banks was public bonds, margin trading, and real estate. Therefore, in the 23rd and 24th years, when the financial crisis broke out, it was almost impossible to recover. After the implementation of the legal currency system, although the business of banks has improved, such as lending to industry and commerce, expanding agricultural loans, and investing in transportation projects, the main use of bank funds is still inseparable from speculation. For example, the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange crisis and the soaring prices of public bonds on the eve of the war. Since the war moved west and Shanghai recovered its prosperity, banks have paid more attention to speculation. The operation of dark exchange, near-term and far-term arbitrage, the trading of margin trading, and the hoarding of goods are more profitable than any investment. By this spring, speculation in foreign stocks and foreign securities has also reached unprecedented levels. But the good times did not last long. The reaction in mid-May this year gave the banking industry a serious lesson. Under the complicated international situation at present, speculation cannot proceed as smoothly as in the past, but banks are still suffering from the lack of good outlets for funds and cannot break away from speculation. Although our country has had banks for decades and their development is very rapid, they have contributed very little to the improvement of the national economy. This is because our government has not strictly supervised and guided the use of bank funds, which has led to the development of banks on the wrong track and sometimes harmed the development of the national economy. This point should be corrected as soon as possible, which is not only conducive to the stability of wartime finance, but also has great assistance to the recovery of the economy after the war. The Ministry of Finance issued ten articles of the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Banks in Extraordinary Times" on August 7 this year, which stipulated that the deposit reserve of each bank must be deposited in the National Bank, and strictly prohibited the bank's own speculative and hoarding activities, and restricted mortgage lending, etc. The purpose is to manage the use of bank funds and have the effect of curbing speculation. If these measures can be effectively implemented, they will have a great effect on combating speculation and hoarding. Although Shanghai is an area beyond the reach of the law, the banking industry should also shoulder the responsibility of stabilizing finance, and can adopt the method of automatic restriction, stop self-operated speculation, and reduce dealings with those who speculate and hoard. Promoting speculation and hoarding is not a good outlet for bank funds. Now, for the sake of national interests and the interests of the banks themselves, we should stop self-operated speculation and cut off the supply to speculators as soon as possible. Although it will reduce profits at present, it can avoid a serious crisis in the future.

In order to achieve the goal of "using war to support war," the Japanese have adopted various means of exploitation to squeeze the occupied areas. The categories of its means can be summarized into the following five categories:

1.  Monopoly: The Japanese have considerable experience in monopoly. Its implementation in Taiwan, Korea, and Japan has achieved considerable results. Monopoly is actually a kind of indirect taxation, embedding taxation in the selling price of goods. Its implementation in its own country is a good system for financial revenue and the national economy, but its implementation in the invaded area can invisibly exploit the people of that area as much as possible. Those who are exploited often do not know who is exploiting them. For example, the rice on the Beijing-Hangzhou lines must be purchased by Japanese foreign firms, and then resold to rice merchants by Japanese foreign firms. However, after the rice has passed through the transitional turnover of Japanese foreign firms, the original selling price has increased by more than double. The ruthlessness of the squeezing is chilling. The so-called Japanese foreign firms are certainly not ordinary commercial firms, but political institutions.

2.  Control: The silk cocoons of Zhejiang and Anhui, the mint of Haimen, Jiangsu, etc., all those that can be exchanged for foreign exchange are controlled and exported by them. We must deliberately make things difficult and not allow them to be shipped.

3.  Heavy taxes: Taking advantage of unscrupulous merchants to contract taxes, no item is exempt from taxes on consumption needs, and the amount of taxes is either heavy or stacked.

4.  Military tickets: Exchanging legal currency with worthless military tickets and joint banknotes, or directly using military tickets to purchase local goods in the occupied areas and requisitioning labor.

5.  Others: Occupying production industries and public utilities to control the consumption of people in the occupied areas and engage in exploitation.

After reading the above, we can get a general understanding of the Japanese exploitation in the occupied areas, and we can also know that the Japanese have used point-line forces to extend to the inner layers and want to dominate the entire occupied area economy. Therefore, the point-line problem does not allow us to cling to the old idea of ​​"not worth mentioning." We should confirm its seriousness and jointly devise countermeasures.

Proper Outlet for Floating Capital

If bank funds can be managed and the trend of speculation can be greatly curbed; after deposit interest rates are increased, floating capital can also be gradually stabilized. If funds still lack a good outlet, wouldn't it be just adding to the burden of banks, and bank funds will flow back into speculation to maintain their own interests. The effect of bank management will certainly not last long. Shanghai feels that there is an excess of floating capital because Shanghai's funds lack an outlet, so it must be moved to the rear to develop the vast west. So that it can cooperate with construction work. Although the call for the transfer of capital to the interior is high, the amount of capital transferred to the interior is still small. The reasons for this are nothing more than the following: First, more than 70% of bank deposits are demand deposits. If the bank implements the transfer to the interior, depositors will panic, which will cause a run on deposits. Second, Shanghai is a den of speculation, who would be willing to abandon it and enter the rear? Third, the economy of the rear has not yet developed, and industries have not yet been built, so there are very few investment targets. Fourth, after the funds flow into the rear, they are subject to domestic remittance restrictions. If they want to flow out again, it will be quite troublesome, so floating capital is also unwilling to move inland rashly. If the difficulties mentioned in the first and second items above can be properly managed, small problems can be solved. But if the other difficulties are not removed, our country's floating capital problem will certainly not be solved. Before implementing the transfer of floating capital to the interior, there are four prerequisite problems that should be solved first. First, the government authorities should guide the outlet of the capital transferred to the interior. Second, the resources of the rear are still to be developed. Using the transferred capital to open up wasteland, the success or failure of the project is difficult to predict. Therefore, the floating capital that is content with speculation in Shanghai will not be willing to do this difficult work, so the government authorities must use interest guarantee methods to encourage it. Third, the capital transferred to the interior is not subject to domestic remittance restrictions, so that its flow is free. Fourth, the application for the purchase of foreign exchange for the transferred capital should be relaxed, and if it is appropriate, the China and Transportation Banks should supply it as much as possible according to the merchant exchange rate.

### Economic Extraction and Feudal Economy

— Zhou Meiyi

More than a year has passed since the Battle of Wuhan. During this period, except for the battles of Changsha and Nanchang, no large-scale fierce war has occurred. Both China and Japan have mostly engaged in economic contention. In the form of economic contention, Japan often takes the initiative, while China is in a passive position. The most obvious ones are the prohibition of traffic between Yunnan and Vietnam, the suspension of navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo, and the past embargo between Yunnan and Myanmar. In addition, there are also the bombing of industrial and commercial areas by Japanese aircraft. The former's embargo and suspension of navigation are intended to cut off the supply of materials to the rear, and the latter's bombing is intended to destroy the rear's productive forces, so as to make our economy fall into poverty and collapse, and the war effort is unable to continue. In the occupied areas, the policy of "using war to support war" is implemented, and our people and materials are exploited as much as possible for use, or transported for export in exchange for foreign exchange. The foreign exchange is used to purchase military supplies from overseas, or directly transported to Japan to supply shortages. All similar to the above are the Japanese's vicious economic tactics.

"Feudal economy" can be adopted as a countermeasure against "using war to support war." The so-called feudal economy is a product brought about by past political separatism. In the past, warlords and other feudal lords often used it to cultivate wealth and consolidate their territories. For example, the self-issued banknotes in Shanxi and Guangdong, the control of local products leaving the province, the interception of donations, and the development of production industries are all aimed at self-sufficiency, so that the economic relationship between the province and the central government is broken. In this way, the economy within his feudal territory can be free from external control. This kind of means is naturally extremely harmful to a government that truly represents the people. On the one hand, it affects its financial revenue, and on the other hand, it aggravates the difficulties in the unification work, hindering political progress. But today, it is implemented in the occupied areas to combat the vicious plan of "using war to support war" and to fight against the exploitation of the people by the monsters. It is the supreme strategy.

In many places in the occupied areas, the economic struggle is obviously not strong enough. Most of them only focus on objective blockades such as prohibiting imports and exports and the circulation of military banknotes, and have not established subjective self-sufficiency, and have not organized the economy. Because of this main defect, the blockade is easily broken through by the Japanese's large-scale use of unscrupulous merchants to smuggle in and out, and in fact, it has not broken away from the urban economy (the city is the point of the point-line) and cannot get rid of being exploited by it. From now on, the occupied areas should strengthen feudalization to the cities, and establish many feudal economic units in the occupied areas. In each unit, investigate the population, estimate the consumption of daily necessities, promote handicrafts, improve local methods, develop production, and plant all kinds of needed crops extensively, not specializing in the planting of a certain crop. (For example, Tonghai and other places produce a large amount of cotton and mint.) Promote self-sufficiency, and then combine it with an objective embargo, then you can achieve the effect of sealing off the city, and at the same time stabilize the lives of the people in the occupied areas. The scope of the organized unit should be as small as possible, and cultivate the habit of the people to organize their own units, because after the Japanese discover this kind of group that economically conflicts with them, they will destroy it with military laws. The small scope of the unit means that those who are destroyed are only limited to a small range and have nothing to do with other units and are not affected. Moreover, the Japanese have limited manpower. The occupied villages are often abandoned soon after they are occupied. After they leave, the people in the unit, based on the organizational habits they have developed in the past, and because this kind of group activity can stabilize their lives and eliminate the exploitation by the Japanese, will be happy to quickly resume their activities for the sake of their own interests.

If we can do the above steps, we will not only have strangled the throat of "using war to support war," but also because the people's lives are stable, we can also reduce many people who are forced by clothing and food to become Japanese puppets.

### Opening a Silver Firm or Bank

— Wu Mengdie

Answer to Mr. Qu Dongsheng

Regarding the seven questions you asked, here are my detailed answers:

(1) "Futures" is the opposite of "spot," and "nearby term" is the opposite of "distant term." Any transaction to be settled within the current month is called "nearby term"; a transaction to be settled next month or in several months is called "distant term"; and a transaction that can be settled on the same day is called "spot." A "short" is a customer who sells first and then buys to cover, because they have a "short position." A "long" is a customer who buys first and then prepares to sell. "Selling" and "buying" are self-explanatory, so there is no need to explain them.

(2) Ordinary silver firms do not have fixed standards for trading margins. Please refer to the previous issue's article on the gold market for information on ×× Firm and its relationship with the Joint Exchange Association.

(3) Whether opening a silver firm as a partnership or a limited liability company, the procedures are the same as opening a general business. However, the operation of such a firm is subject to the restrictions of the Banking Law, but the Banking Law has not yet been fully implemented.

(4) ×× Foreign Firm, etc., are brokers who trade on behalf of customers. They are formal businesses. It's like a rice shop being a formal store, but a rice shop manipulating rice prices is like a rice weevil.

(5) According to the Banking Law, both banks and silver firms fall under Article 1 of the Banking Law: "Anyone engaged in one of the following businesses is a bank: 1. Accepting deposits and making loans; 2. Discounting bills; 3. Remittance or documentary credit. Anyone engaged in one of the preceding businesses without being a bank is regarded as a bank." However, the reason why there are so many silver firms in Shanghai is that silver firms are, in name, financial institutions outside of banks and native banks, and thus can operate without restrictions. Remittance business is a banking business. Whether trading on behalf of customers is legal depends on the circumstances. If one trades cotton yarn on behalf of customers, it is naturally illegal. The recently enacted "Special Period Management of Banking Law" has explicitly prohibited this.

(6) The Central Bank is a national bank, and its exchange rate postings are formal. Before the war, the exchange rate postings of HSBC were based on the Central Bank's postings, just like the postings of small native banks on Sichuan Road, which copied HSBC's postings. After the war, due to China's management of foreign exchange, the Central Bank's postings became nominal prices, while HSBC's postings reflected the actual black market trading prices. Because HSBC is a commercial bank with semi-official British status, black market foreign exchange trading is concentrated there.

(7) Banks do not have special storage for customers' purchases of public bonds. There are currently no futures for public bonds in the black market. As for whether the prices of futures and spot goods are high or low, it depends on the financial situation and commodity circulation situation of the current month and the next month.

### Electricity Bill Calculation Method

— Huang Yunjian

Since the recent increase in electricity rates, general users, not understanding the calculation methods, have often overlooked the electricity cost component in the cost of ordinary manufactured goods, resulting in inaccurate calculations. Therefore, I will explain my calculation method below.

For example, if 63 kilowatt-hours of electricity are used for lighting, costing 7 taels, 5 mace, and 6 fen of silver, with a surcharge of 180.97%, the cost per kilowatt-hour is 3 fen, 3 li, 7 hao, 1 si, 6 hu, 4 xu, 0 yi of silver. Using a tariff of 0.715, the cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour is 4 jiao, 7 fen, 1 li, 5 hao, 5 si, 6 hu in national currency.

The cost of electricity for ordinary power users is much lower than that for lighting. Each kilowatt-hour costs only 4 fen and 5 li of silver, which is 3 fen and 2 li, 9 hao in national currency. Now, with a surcharge rate of 355.87%, the cost has increased considerably compared to before. However, the cost per kilowatt-hour is still only 1 qian and 5 li, 1 hao, 4 si, 1 hu, which is 1 jiao, 8 fen, 6 li, 9 hao in national currency. For example, if 1488 kilowatt-hours of ordinary power are used, costing 66 taels, 9 mace, and 6 fen of silver, with a surcharge of 355.87%, the cost per kilowatt-hour is 1 qian and 5 li, 1 hao, 4 si, 1 hu of silver. Using a tariff of 0.715, the cost of ordinary power per kilowatt-hour should be 2 jiao, 8 fen, 6 li, 9 hao.

### Financial Review

— Sheng Kaiqiong

—November 9th— Economic Construction in Sichuan and Kangding

After entering the second stage of the Sino-Japanese War, it has shifted from a military war to an economic war. Currently, the provinces of Sichuan and Kangding in China are important bases for resisting Japan and building the nation. To strengthen the power of economic warfare, we must actively and effectively promote the various facilities and organization of agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, transportation, and finance in these two provinces. Therefore, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the Sichuan-Kangding Economic Construction Committee was formally established in Chengdu on November 2nd. The committee brings together the power of the government and the people, concentrates the leaders of the Party, government, military, and civilians in Sichuan and Kangding, as well as prominent scholars from within and outside the provinces. On the day of its establishment, it convened its first general meeting, which lasted for three days. The meeting passed more than seventy motions. Following the draft outline of the Sichuan-Kangding Economic Construction Plan proposed by Chairman Chiang, the draft three-year Sichuan Economic Construction Plan of the Sichuan Provincial Production Planning Committee, and the Outline of Kangding Economic Construction proposed by the Kangding Provincial Government, the meeting formulated a complete and concrete Sichuan-Kangding Economic Construction Plan. At the same time, it was decided to expand funding and quickly establish the Sichuan-Kangding Industrial Development Company as an institution to practically promote economic construction. Sichuan Province has abundant resources and has long been known as the "Land of Abundance," which shows the great potential of its economy. After the war of resistance began, it became the rear center of China. To meet the needs of national defense and lay the foundation for people's livelihood, economic construction must naturally be coordinated with politics and military affairs, with Sichuan Province as the center. As for Kangding, which is adjacent to Sichuan, although it is a newly established province, it has many treasures. Except for the inconvenience in transportation, everything is suitable for economic construction. We should place the greatest hope on this new province and must not waste its resources.

Since the start of the war, the central government has invested more than 30 million yuan in Sichuan to manage steel, fuel, public utilities, electricity, and power supply industries related to national defense. It has also assisted private enterprises such as the steel industry, chemical industry, paper industry, match industry, fuel industry, machinery industry, power industry, and textile industry, with a total investment of more than 30 million yuan. In terms of agricultural loans, the accurate total is more than 40 million yuan, accounting for one-third of the total agricultural loans in the country. As for the establishment of Kangding Province, the industrial construction has also made considerable progress in the past year. Woolen mills have been established in Kangding and Ya'an, using the cattle and sheep hides produced in Kangding and Ganzi. A larger leather factory has been specially established in Ya'an, using new methods to manufacture leather; a paper mill has been established using the white bamboo produced in Ya'an; and a wood dry distillation plant has been established somewhere on the eastern slope of Daxue Mountain, utilizing the rich forests. At the same time, a hydroelectric power plant has been established to meet the needs of Ya'an's industry, providing industrial power. These are only a part of the economic construction of Sichuan and Kangding. There are still many other businesses that can be developed and urgently need to be developed, requiring continued efforts in many aspects. (To be continued)

### Sugar Prices Continue to Rise Sharply

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to advance, with a stronger upward trend. The association's board set the price of spot white sugar at 72.5 yuan for Ben Zhan and 72 yuan for Wai Zhan, both up 5 jiao; Dutch cotton white BS mark at 69 yuan, KA mark at 72.5 yuan, up about 1 yuan; Dutch red spot at 56 yuan to 56.1 yuan, up 3 jiao; Taikoo TK mark fine sand at 73 yuan to 73.2 yuan; and Che Bai B mark at 71.5 yuan to 71.8 yuan initially for the West Zhan, later rising to 74.2 yuan, up 1.2 yuan; East Zhan at 73.5 yuan, up 1 yuan; DY mark at 68.3 yuan for the West Zhan and 68 yuan for the East Zhan, up 6 jiao; HX mark at 68.2 yuan for the West Zhan and 67.5 yuan to 67.8 yuan for the East Zhan, up 8 jiao; Ben Yi Hao ice at 92.5 yuan, Jing Ming ice at 94 yuan, both up 1 yuan.

### Raw Peanuts Firm

The market price of raw peanuts has gradually become firmer recently. The latest opening prices are listed below: Qingdao peanuts 50 yuan, Bengbu peanuts 46-47 yuan, Jiangbei peanuts 45-46 yuan, Xuzhou peanuts 43-44 yuan, Jiangbei peanuts 40 yuan.

### 7,000 Tons of Hebei Coal Arrive, Not Yet Open for Trading

Since 7,000 tons of new Hebei white coal were loaded last month, the bustling market atmosphere in the upper wharves of Pudong has been stabilized, indicating that there is no need to worry about a shortage of coal for stoves this winter. Unexpectedly, to this day, due to internal disputes among the managers and dealers, the market has not yet opened, and there have been no transactions. It is said that the incoming price is very cheap, only over 140 yuan per ton, plus water freight and tariffs, the opening price should be within 200 yuan.

### Flat White Iron Rises Again and Again

The market condition of flat white iron has been very good recently. The reason is that the circulating goods in the market are extremely scarce, and those who want to buy are worried that there is no goods to buy. Moreover, merchants from the inland rivers often search for goods, and the transactions of construction workers and retail buyers in this street are also very lively, and the hoarders also hoarding for profit, so there is not enough spot goods to distribute for a time, so the industry peers who hold the goods are quite prosperous.

### Tomorrow is the Anniversary of the Premier's Birth: The Whole City Will Celebrate by Hanging National Flags; Emulate the Premier's Personality and Support National Policies; Donate Winter Clothing Funds and Actively Promote

Tomorrow is the anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen. All sectors deeply admire the Premier's great achievements and devotion to the revolution, because it was the Premier's birth that led to the establishment of the Republic of China. At that time, flags will be hung to express celebration. Government agencies, public organizations, schools, and silver and money industries will also take a holiday as usual. The Bureau of Public Works and all its subordinate offices will also close for one day. In order to support national policies and complete the great cause of national construction, all sectors have decided to expand the promotion of frugal national construction savings, promote production and construction, and continue to donate funds for winter clothing to comfort the soldiers and rescue the refugees. The authorities of the two concessions believe that tomorrow is the anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation, and the day after tomorrow is the third anniversary of the withdrawal of Chinese troops to the west. In order to maintain security within the concessions, they will be on high alert from tomorrow onwards to strengthen defenses.

Holiday Celebrations for Chinese and Foreign Institutions

The embassies and consulates of the Central, American, French, German, Italian, and other countries in this city, as well as the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession and the Municipal Council of the French Concession, will all be closed for one day to celebrate the Premier's birthday. A notice has been issued to all foreign residents of these countries. Except for temporary emergencies, all official business will resume on the 13th. The courts, customs, post offices, and other institutions and groups, schools at all levels, factories, banks, and money shops in this city will also follow the central government's regulations and close for one day, in addition to hanging flags according to the law, in order to celebrate.

Strict Precautions and Strict Enforcement of Curfew

The police authorities of the two concessions have, in addition to explicitly prohibiting gatherings, associations, parades, demonstrations, and other activities since the 7th, and strictly enforcing curfew laws, also started to tighten security from yesterday onwards to prevent illegal activities by bad elements. The authorities of the Public Concession have also increased posts in the west and north districts, and dispatched more patrol and search teams to check passing vehicles and pedestrians, and dispatched police cars to patrol in separate districts. On the French Concession side, from 7:00 am to 11:00 pm, armed patrol teams composed of French, Chinese, and Vietnamese police officers patrolled the roads. If they encountered suspicious pedestrians or vehicles, they were stopped and checked. As for road traffic, it is said that there are no plans to close it.

Active Promotion of Winter Clothing Donations

The Lide Fellowship Society issued a notice to all its members yesterday, because tomorrow is the anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation, urging them to emulate the Father of the Nation's spirit of struggle and make further efforts to promote the movement of national construction savings, donations, and winter clothing donations in all sectors. Based on the experience of the National Day fundraising, the society notified all members to pay attention to two points: (1) According to the statistics of the previous resolution, most of the savings, donations, and winter clothing donations come from salaried classes. It is believed that the patriotism of the wealthy classes and large enterprises in Shanghai is not behind others. All members should strive to promote in this direction in order to achieve great results. (2) A few members are unable to actively promote due to fear of interference from the concession authorities, but they must know that the fundraising work will not affect the security of the concession. Everyone has a motherland, and the concession authorities love their countries as well. As civilized human beings, they will never suppress the minimum patriotic actions of the citizens. Do not be timid and discouraged, and neglect to promote it.

### Establishment of the Fundraising Committee of the China Relief Association for Women and Children

The China Relief Association for Women and Children has established a fundraising committee due to insufficient relief funds. Yu Qiaqing was appointed as the honorary chairman, and Wen Lantin, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Jiqing, Zhao Jinqing, and Zhu Zikui were appointed as honorary vice-chairmen. Xu Qianlin was appointed as the chairman, Lin Kanghou was appointed as the chairman of the committee, Xu Xiaochu and Xu Guanqun were appointed as the vice-chairmen, and Huang Yuzhai and Li Wenjie were appointed as the directors of finance. A letter was issued to the citizens of all circles yesterday, appealing to all sectors to donate funds.

### Good News from Chinese Troops in Wujiang County

According to a person from Wujiang County, at the end of last month, the troops of the Chinese guerrilla team led by Chen Yaozong, who were moving in the vicinity of Shangta and Xinta, were suddenly attacked by a large number of Japanese troops and miscellaneous troops totaling more than 200 people. The Chinese side was prepared and immediately attacked from the east and west, surrounding the enemy on all sides, and using light and heavy machine guns to sweep the Japanese troops in close formation. After five or six hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese troops had no target and could not land, suffering heavy casualties and retreating in defeat. Unexpectedly, the next morning, a large number of Japanese troops arrived from the direction of Qingpu Jiaoli, intending to retaliate. So the two sides fought fiercely again. From about 9:00 am to 6:00 pm, the Japanese troops were finally defeated by the Chinese troops' irresistible force, and retreated due to the approaching dusk. According to nearby villagers, the two sides fought for as long as ten hours in this battle. The Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties and had their weapons damaged. A speedboat was sunk by the Chinese troops with small mortars. As for the Chinese side, due to proper concealment and the protection of dozens of machine gun emplacements, the casualties were very slight.

### After the Seizure of the Two Courts, the National Government Lodges a Protest, Officially Delivered to the French Ambassador

Chongqing, November 10 (Haitong News Agency). The Chinese National Government in Chongqing yesterday delivered a protest to the French Ambassador, protesting against the transfer of the Second Special District Local Court and the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Provincial High Court to the "Nanjing Government" by the authorities of the French Concession in Shanghai. On the other hand, the Chinese government has instructed the two courts to cease operations. At the same time, it was announced that the courts set up by the "Nanjing Government" in Shanghai were illegal.

### Promotional Activities for Frugal Savings Movement to be Held from Yesterday; Universally Advise Relatives and Friends to Actively Save; Cultivate the Virtue of Thrift and Complete National Construction

Since the National Frugal National Construction Savings Movement Committee stipulated that the period from November 10th to 16th should be the National Expanded Frugal Savings Movement Promotion Week, various groups in Shanghai have been ordered to comply. However, due to the special situation of the Shanghai concession area, no public ceremonies will be held, and efforts will be made to participate in the Frugal National Construction Savings Movement, purchase savings bonds, or open accounts at the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the National Agricultural Bank, and the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau to save money, and universally advise relatives and friends to actively save, in order to cultivate the virtue of thrift and achieve the purpose of frugal national construction. Frugal savings is the only way to absorb idle funds, increase production, balance prices, and stabilize society.

(Savings) Frugal National Construction Savings are accepted by government officials, businesses, banks, and postal remittance bureaus throughout the country, and the safety of principal and interest is guaranteed by the government. National currency of one yuan or more can be used to open an account, and depositors can deposit money at any time. The principal and interest can only be withdrawn after five years. Banks that accept National Construction Savings must apply to the Ministry of Finance for approval in advance and be given a higher interest rate than ordinary savings. The accounting is completely independent and is not mixed with the profits and losses of the business. The use of savings is limited to land reclamation, water conservancy construction, national defense production, mining development, and investment in economic construction projects.

(Bonds) The Central Trust Bureau, the Bank of Communications, the National Commercial Bank of China, and the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, issue Frugal National Construction Savings Bonds, which are divided into two types, A and B. Type A is purchased by saving according to the face value, and interest and dividends are given when the bonds are redeemed upon maturity. Type B is redeemed at face value after maturity with interest estimated at the time of purchase. Type A earns 6% weekly interest after six months, 7% weekly interest after one year, 7.5% weekly interest from the second year, and compound interest every six months, with dividends added at the end of the fifth year. Type B estimates interest at 7% weekly interest for one year, 7.5% weekly interest for two years, 8% weekly interest for three to five years, and 8.5% weekly interest for more than five years.

### Notice from the Chamber of Commerce and Silver and Money Industries: Strictly Absorb Deposits

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Silver and Money Industries Association, following the instruction No. 17922 from the Ministry of Finance in Chongqing, strictly prohibit general commercial firms from concurrently engaging in absorbing deposits or handling remittances. It has recently notified member associations and banks and money shops to comply with and handle matters in accordance with the instructions, and to reward those who report violations and strictly investigate and deal with them.

### Vacancies for Foreign Police Officers in the Police Department: Promotion of Chinese Officers Recommended by the Economic Committee

The Special Economic Committee of the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession has recently completed its review of the economic situation of various departments of the Public Works Bureau. Regarding the police department, the committee believes that it is difficult to restrain or reform the police department under the current situation, because the number of cases in the concession is accumulating, and personnel and expenses cannot be reduced.

Promotion of Chinese Officers to Fill Vacancies for Foreign Police Officers

It is learned that the committee has made the following recommendations to the police department: The vacancies for foreign police officers in the first and second sections and the Indian police section should be filled as soon as possible to reach the budgeted number of people. The vacancies for foreign police officers should be filled by promoting senior Chinese officers (those with higher ranks of "Deputy Inspector"). The Indian police section should be supplemented by promoting or recruiting junior officers (constables and sergeants). The salaries and allowances should all be paid in local currency.

Akaki Report: Committee's Opinion

When the committee was conducting the investigation of the police department, Akira Akaki, the Japanese special police chief, submitted a report on the second section of the foreign police department and proposed a reorganization plan. However, the committee has not yet expressed any opinion on Akaki's report, but believes that any police officer, regardless of nationality, should be able to be promoted to the highest position if they can prove their competence. As far as Japanese police officers are concerned, when the new "E district" planned by the police department is established, experienced police officers will also have the opportunity to be promoted.

### Accounts of the Poor Children's Relief Center to be Submitted to the Competent Authority

The accounts of the Poor Children's Out-of-School Relief Center in this city, after being investigated by the chairman of the board, Shou Yong, the supervisors Wu Yunzhai and Dai Chunfeng, and the director Sun Choucheng, have been compiled and submitted to the competent authority for verification by the board of directors, which includes the usual income and expenses, the broadcast income and expenses, and the audited accounts of the accountant. Therefore, the truth will be revealed to the public soon.

### As the European Bloody War is in Full Swing, Peace Prayers are Offered Today; Flowers are Offered Before the Goddess of Peace; British Residents Offer the Cost of Buying Flowers to the Motherland

Twenty-three years ago today was the day the European War ceased. The words of the Treaty of Versailles are still in existence, but unexpectedly a second war has broken out. When commemorating the peace of today, and recalling the future evolution of the situation, there are two kinds of feelings. The British, American, and French people here will offer flowers before the goddess of peace this morning to express their sorrow.

The Money for Buying Flowers is Used as War Funds

In previous years, the British residents in Shanghai, under the leadership of the British Victory Association, held a grand flower offering ceremony. The wreaths were even brought from London. In addition to everyone wearing white flowers on their lapels, they were publicly exhibited at the British Victory Association Hall. A thousand British residents visited, and the money from the sale of all the wreaths was remitted to the motherland to be used for the families of the disabled soldiers in the war during the war, and part of it was designated for use in Shanghai. Therefore, the value of each flower or wreath was considerable. However, this year, the funds for offering wreaths will be used to support the national war fund.

British Residents Hold Flower Offering Ceremony

Usually on this day of commemorating peace, in addition to the British residents, the commander of the British troops stationed here presides over the flower offering ceremony. This year's situation is different from previous years. The British troops have withdrawn, and the British Victory Association and the British Legion will be in charge of everything. The pastor will hold a prayer at 8:30 am this morning before the goddess of peace at the corner of Edward Road. However, the time will be short and the ceremony will be simple. All private dinners, dances, and all-night gatherings will not be held this year. Only a peace prayer was held at the American church yesterday morning.

Celebration Banquet for the US Marine Corps

On the anniversary of the US Fourth Marine Corps, a musical program and hymns are usually held at the Grand Theater. However, yesterday at 9:00 am, in commemoration of the first European war peace, the pastor of the corps presided over the event. Yesterday was also the 165th anniversary of the establishment of the US Marine Corps. At 8:00 pm last night, US Marine Corps Commander Baker, US Consul General Lockhead, US China Assessor Justice Hailmilk, US Yangtze Fleet Commander Rear Admiral Glassford, and senior officers of the Fourth Marine Corps held a banquet at the consulate on Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road to celebrate. The leaders of the American community in this port, the senior officials of the Public Works Bureau, and the senior officers of the International Volunteer Corps were all invited.

US Military Pastor Prays for Peace

The US naval authorities in Shanghai cannot fail to express their views on the annual commemoration of the end of the European War. Therefore, it was also decided that at 11:00 am today, Colonel Baker of the Fourth Marine Corps would lead all officers to make a similar flower offering ceremony before the god of peace. The accompanying pastor will pray for peace. Today is the commemoration of the European War Peace, and tomorrow is the Premier's birthday. The US Consulate will be closed for one day.

### French Tramway and Bus Fares to Increase Regularly, Effective the 13th, Increase of One Cent Per Stop

Regarding the rumored increase in fares for French tramways, which was said to take effect yesterday (the 10th), tram fares on all lines in the French Concession remained unchanged from previously set prices. According to inquiries by a Pingming News Agency reporter, the French Water and Electricity Company, after being approved by the French Municipal Council to increase various water and electricity fees, implemented the increase on the 6th of this month. However, the tramway portion required further assessment, so the fare increase could not be implemented simultaneously. It is now heard that the tramway fare increase will take effect the day after tomorrow (the 13th), with an increase of 25% to 50% per mile, or one cent per stop. The French bus lines will also increase fares at the same time.

### Bank of China Continues to Accept British Banknotes

Since the British government ordered a ban on the circulation of Bank of England banknotes outside the UK, the Chinese Ministry of Finance, to protect the interests of Chinese citizens holding these banknotes, designated Bank of China branches as the agency for collecting and exchanging these banknotes for remittance to the UK. This was originally scheduled to end on August 28th. Now, due to transportation difficulties for those in the interior holding these banknotes, who were unable to exchange them within the deadline, the Ministry of Finance has, after consultation with the British authorities, ordered the Bank of China to continue accepting these banknotes to avoid losses for Chinese holders. The Bank of China head office has already notified all branches to comply.

### Second US Evacuation Ship to Leave Shanghai Tonight, Expected to Arrive Here at 11 AM Today, Destination After Korea Unknown

The second US evacuation ship, the "Mariposa," was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 9th. According to an announcement by the American President Lines, the ship's telegram stated that it would be delayed until 11 AM today, docking at buoys 11 and 12. The ship will depart Shanghai at midnight due to the tight schedule, via Qinhuangdao, Chemulpo, Kobe, and Honolulu. American nationals from various parts of North China will board the ship in Qinhuangdao and Chemulpo. The "Mariposa" is scheduled to depart from Qinhuangdao on the 13th of this month. American nationals there have already booked 100 first-class tickets and 125 second- and third-class tickets. American President Lines officials could not yet comment on how many American nationals would be evacuated from Korea or what the ship's actions would be after leaving Busan.

Already Evacuated Women and Children Total Over a Thousand

It is estimated that over 700 American nationals have been evacuated from Shanghai so far, including 328 on the first evacuation ship, 94 on the Changxing Company's "Asia Queen," 190 on the American President Lines' "Coolidge," and 90 on the "President Pierce." Combined with the 85 scheduled to be evacuated on the second special ship "Mariposa" and the 600 on the third special ship "Washington," the total number is 1,387. In addition, those who left Shanghai on Japanese ships are not included in this number. It is heard that many American nationals are unwilling to evacuate on the special ships dispatched by the State Department, partly because it takes too much time and partly because the fares are too high.

Three More Ships to Arrive This Month

As for the third evacuation ship, the "Washington," it is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 17th and depart on the 21st. It is heard that there are still many vacant cabins. In addition, ships on regular routes can also be used to evacuate American nationals. This month, the American President Lines' "Taft" is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 21st, and the Changxing Company's "Asia Queen" is scheduled to depart on the 1st of next month.

Far East Situation Cloudy, But No Rain Yet

Since President Roosevelt's victory in the election, the isolationist and appeasement policies at home have been suppressed, and a stronger policy is about to be adopted in the Far East and Europe to oppose aggression and protect American interests. However, when this will be put into action is not yet clear. A reporter met with an observer yesterday to inquire about his opinion. According to his observation, it will be after the United States completes the evacuation of women and children from the Far East. Considering that the second evacuation ship will leave Shanghai on the 21st and go to San Francisco via Manila, the timeframe is not far off. There may be new developments next month. Recently, the Far East appears calm on the surface, but judging from the Japanese army's withdrawal from Nanning and troop movements, its ambition to advance south has not been quelled. The United States is also watching intently and actively preparing, as if waiting for Japan to start a conflict. The fact that the evacuation of American nationals in the Far East is limited to women and children who have no need to stay in Shanghai shows that the United States is determined to protect its interests in the Far East and will not easily give up unless absolutely necessary.

### Former Central Bank Site Sold to Foreign Merchants, Occupation Plan Likely to Encounter Difficulties, Building Has Important Historical Significance

The "North-China Daily News" reported that the Central Bank building at the corner of Jiujiang Road and the Bund was taken over yesterday (the 9th) in the presence of officers from the Public Concession Police and the Japanese Military Police. The ultimate purpose of this move is still unknown.

Japanese Side Notified of Decision to Take Over

However, according to reliable sources, the building will be used to open a "Central Bank." Before the takeover, the Japanese Military Police notified the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council of their intention to take over the property. Just after 9 AM, officers from the Central Police Station were dispatched to the building to open it and inspect it before leaving near noon. The building had been vacant for some time, and there was no one in charge, only a few guards. In the afternoon, the building was taken over.

Observing the Situation, Repairs Seem Likely

The so-called important personnel have not yet entered the building, but there was activity in the left courtyard. Looking through the locked courtyard gate, many armed "political police" were seen, some in black uniforms and some in plain clothes, moving back and forth in the courtyard. The exact number is unknown. Several Public Concession police officers were stationed in front of the building, under orders not to allow idlers inside. Judging from the activity inside the building yesterday, it seems that repairs will be carried out first, and then personnel will move in. Yesterday morning, many laborers were engaged in cleaning.

Rumored That the Building Is Owned by Foreign Merchants

The Central Bank of the Nationalist Government has long since withdrawn from the building, and a Municipal Council school was temporarily opened there. However, the school recently moved to Great Western Road, so the building is unoccupied. It is rumored that the Chongqing government has sold the building to foreign merchants. If this is true, the plan to use the building will likely encounter difficulties. The Central Bank building is the original site of the defunct Russo-Asiatic Bank and has important historical significance.

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Once Visited

After the Nationalist Government obtained the property, it was used as the official Central Bank's office. High-ranking government officials visited the building, such as Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and Song Ziwen, who is currently in the United States, both of whom served as Presidents of the Central Bank and had offices there. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also visited the building to personally see Kong Xiangxi off to England to attend the coronation of the British monarch. Therefore, the transfer of the building is of great importance to the Chinese side.

### Shanghai Branch of Nanjing Bank to Resume Business, Deposits to be Paid in Full

The Shanghai branch of the Nanjing Commercial Savings Bank, which temporarily suspended business on June 17th of this year, had planned a settlement plan through the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Now, with the approval of the Chongqing head office, it will resume business on the 14th of this month (Thursday). It is stipulated that all types of deposits at the bank, whether fixed or current, and those holding the bank's promissory notes and transfer orders, will be paid in full in cash from the date of resumption of business. Ding Shangui has been newly appointed as manager, and in addition to Zhu Kaiguan as deputy manager, Qian Jiazhen has also been appointed. The bank has reported this to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Association for filing.

### Mediation of Tungho Bank Debt Established

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce held a third mediation session for the commercial department debt of Tungho Commercial Savings Bank at the Hong Kong Road Banking Association Club at 3 PM yesterday. Creditors representing 80% of the debt attended and approved the settlement plan proposed by the bank, which includes: (1) The directors and supervisors of the bank will be responsible for raising 20% of the cash, with 10% to be returned within one month after the settlement is established, and the remaining 10% to be returned by the end of the lunar year at the latest; (2) The remaining debt, including principal and interest of 300,000 national currency, is secured by the bank's mortgage rights to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which will be transferred to all creditors of the bank's commercial department, and five representatives elected by the creditors will be in charge of it, which will be used for full debt repayment. Dong Yu, Zhang Yiping, Xu Zuyan, Cheng Kefan, and Zhang Enhai were elected as representatives to sign the settlement terms and as custodians. The meeting adjourned satisfactorily at 4:30 PM.

### Detained Goods in Vietnam Protested

Regarding the Shanghai-Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou joint transportation of passengers and goods detained in Vietnam, after the Vietnamese governor canceled the order to return them to Shanghai and Hong Kong, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs and other departments for negotiations. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Chamber of Commerce yesterday that the Chamber of Commerce had received a telegram from the Chinese Consulate in Saigon stating, "When your Chamber of Commerce's telegram of October 30th was received, this consulate had already issued a protest." Also, the Saigon Cholon Chamber of Commerce telegraphed Shanghai, "This matter has been mediated."

### Difficult Children's Calligraphy and Painting Chrysanthemum Exhibition Held Closing Ceremony Yesterday

The Shanghai Difficult Children's Education and Welfare Institute's calligraphy and painting chrysanthemum exhibition, which opened on November 17th at the Continental Swimming Pool, has been running for two weeks. Yesterday was the last day, and the closing ceremony was held at 3 PM. More than 700 guests attended. Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the institute, presided over the ceremony, and an award ceremony was held until 4 PM.

People from all walks of life have competed to buy chrysanthemums, calligraphy, and paintings to contribute to charity. It is heard that the total revenue for the two weeks is close to 10,000 yuan, which will all be used for the institute's expenses.

### Russian Stamp Society News

The Russian Stamp Society announces that, from November 4, 1940, it has moved to 1053 Avenue Foch, at the intersection of Route Hude. The public exhibition hours remain the same, and the auction will still be held every Tuesday.

According to a telegram from Ningbo, the situation regarding plague prevention and control is as follows: (1) The Central Anti-Epidemic Team will arrive in Ningbo from Jinhua today to assist the Yin County Epidemic Prevention Office in carrying out plague eradication and prevention work. (2) The Yin County government has decided to inoculate households in the vicinity of the epidemic area. In addition, in the Class A quarantine hospital, eight more patients yesterday were in critical condition and their lives were in danger. Their symptoms were redness, headache, high fever, red spots all over the body, and even some vomiting blood. The Class B quarantine hospital had 26 patients and admitted ten new patients yesterday. (3) The epidemic prevention team searched and found twelve patients who had escaped from the epidemic area yesterday, all of whom were sent to the Class B quarantine hospital. A black dog infected with the plague was also found on Kaiming Street, shot dead, and buried by the burial team. The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai, in view of the serious plague in Ningbo, although prevention and control is appropriate and has not spread, the deaths of people in the epidemic area are successive, the situation is tragic, and medical treatment and burial expenses are high, has decided to convene a committee meeting in the coming days to discuss raising funds for disaster relief in Ningbo to benefit their hometown.

Telegram Appeal for Disaster Relief Funds

November 9th, telegram from Ningbo: Mr. Yu Qiaqing, in confidence, a plague has occurred in Ningbo, with successive deaths. The East Avenue area from No. 224 to No. 268 is now strictly sealed off. Residents in the area are moved to quarantine wards. Fortunately, the epidemic has not spread beyond the epidemic area in recent days. To eradicate it thoroughly, the houses and debris in the epidemic area must be burned, and the affected households should be provided with relief.

### Mercenary Soldiers Near Suzhou Revolt

According to people coming from Suzhou, since the Japanese army launched its autumn offensive, the Japanese army has been transferred out of the Jinghu area, and the defense is left to mercenary soldiers, and they are ordered to carry out so-called "sweeping" operations to strengthen their momentum. Therefore, recently, a large number of "troops" from Nanjing have been stationed in various towns near Suzhou, oppressing the people in every way. Two weeks ago, a large team of "Guards Brigade" from Nanjing was also stationed in Jiaozhi Town. However, these mercenary soldiers, in view of the fact that the

Guerrilla Commander Hu Zhaoyu in the area is deeply loved by the people, and the local market is more prosperous than the Japanese-occupied area, the people live and work in peace, and the cooperation between the army and the people is something they cannot do. Among the lower-level personnel of this team, there are also many who understand the general situation. Seeing this scene, they were greatly moved, and then sent representatives to contact Commander Hu to revolt, requesting to be given a chance to rehabilitate themselves. On the night of the next day,

they led their troops to surrender, bringing with them six machine guns, hundreds of Italian-made rifles, and countless ammunition. When the remnants heard the news, they fled in panic. They were ambushed by Commander Hu's troops, and many were killed or wounded. They fled towards Suzhou in a panic. In order to show their sincerity in participating in the work of national construction, the revolting troops requested Commander Hu to send troops to suppress the "Pacification Army" in Likou on the second day, and

were willing to act as scouts and guides. Commander Hu immediately approved the request and sent troops to surround and attack fiercely, and immediately defeated a large team, seizing countless guns and ammunition. Therefore, in recent days, the mercenary soldiers in the suburbs of Suzhou are all afraid of themselves and have fled to the urban area.

### Iron Nets Still Set Up at Alley Entrances on Yu Yuan Road, Public Buses Stopped as Before

The "Shanghai Times" reported that the Municipal Council authorities, in view of the successive criminal cases that have occurred in the western district of the Public Concession in the past few days, added many barbed wire obstacles at the entrances of alleys along Yu Yuan Road and the border area of the Public Concession yesterday (the 9th) morning. Public buses traveling along Yu Yuan Road are still being blocked by the Japanese. Although there are rumors that all obstacles will be gradually removed, the situation in the western district of Shanghai yesterday remained the same. Regarding the re-establishment of barbed wire by the Japanese Military Police in the western Hongkou district, it is said that the Japanese authorities consider this a necessary measure because this measure is not within the scope of the recently concluded temporary agreement between the Japanese side and the Municipal Council.

### Two Native Place Associations Group Purchase Rice

The Shaoxing Seven Counties Native Place Association in Shanghai believes that the rising rice prices in the city, although due to complex reasons, are mainly due to weak reserves. Therefore, it believes that group rice purchases can increase reserves and stop the rice prices from soaring. In view of this, the association has formulated regulations and entrusted the Tongrun Money Shop in Jiyi Lane, Tianjin Road, to collect rice funds, with each household purchasing five bags of No. 2 Xian rice as the starting unit. More purchases are allowed, and fellow countrymen in Shanghai are encouraged to participate in this charitable cause. The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai, in order to expand the group rice purchase of fellow countrymen, issued a respectful notice to the fellow countrymen in Shanghai, stating the crux of the rising rice prices in Shanghai and the benefits of group rice purchase for the entire people's food.

### The Circumstances of the Shooting Death of General Zhu Qinglan's Eldest Son, Vietnamese Police Arbitrarily Opened Fire, Unreasonable to Describe, Zhu's Family Has Hired a French Lawyer, Filed a Public Prosecution with the French Concession Authorities

Zhu Hua, a third-year architecture student at Soochow University in Shanghai, and his younger brother, Zhu Shu, are the sons of General Zhu Qinglan. Some time ago (the 5th), Zhu Hua's younger brother, Zhu Shu, went out to shop for a long time, and he did not return home, and Zhu Hua also went out to look for him. As he walked to Rue Ladu, he saw his younger brother quarreling with Vietnamese police and hooligans in front. At that time, another Vietnamese policeman passed by, and Zhu Hua asked him to mediate. This Vietnamese policeman did not ask about the truth, and shot him once, the bullet pierced through his abdomen, and he was sent to Guangci Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he died on the morning of the 6th. Now Zhu's family has hired a French lawyer and filed a public prosecution with the French Concession authorities. A reporter from the Dachung News Agency drove to visit Zhu's family yesterday afternoon to inquire about the beginning and end of the accident. I would like to provide the following details:

The Accident Happened At about 7 PM on November 5th, the student Zhu Shu (with his brother Hua, who lived in Tao's house, No. 10 Remy Lane), went out to buy fruit after dinner. After buying it at the intersection of Rue Ladu and Rue Remy, he went to the fruit stand at the intersection of Avenue Auguste Savy and Rue Ladu to inquire about the price. At that time, a girl of fourteen or five years old walked past, and several people made indecent jokes with the girl, saying filthy words. Zhu Shu

Seeing the injustice of the road, he glared at these rascals. These people then turned to scolding Zhu Shu. Zhu Shu, feeling that he was being insulted for no reason, questioned them. These people were unreasonable, and they gathered around Zhu Shu to cause trouble. At this time, another rogue punched Zhu Shu in the back, and the punch happened to hit the hunting knife Zhu Shu was wearing on his waist. (This hunting knife was a souvenir from Zhu Shu's time in the Boy Scouts, it was not sharpened, had no blood grooves, and the road police were asked if it could be worn) He shouted to his companions, "This person is carrying a 'dagger'", so a dozen rascals gathered together to rob it. Zhu Shu was outnumbered, and the hunting knife was

stolen by the rascals, but Zhu Shu still held onto the sleeves of the two rascals and called for the police, and asked the Vietnamese police (A) to return the hunting knife. Zhu Shu then asked the Vietnamese police to take all the people to the police station. The Vietnamese police repeatedly said "Okay, okay". Zhu Shu's brother, Zhu Hua (23 years old, studied in the Architecture Department of Soochow University for three years, with a pure and peaceful personality, always ranked excellent in every exam), was at home and missed his younger brother Zhu Shu, who had been out shopping for a long time and had not returned. He went out to look for him and saw the police (A) and his younger brother and many people walking north when he arrived at Rue Ladu (on the east sidewalk).

He hurried up to ask what was going on and scolded his younger brother for not arguing with others, but the Vietnamese police (A) did not know that Zhu Hua and Zhu Shu were brothers, and used a stick to drive him away. Zhu Hua felt that it was unreasonable to describe, and hurried away. At this time, another Vietnamese police (B) came from behind on a bicycle (wearing a round hat near the west sidewalk). Zhu Hua thought that this person must be of a slightly higher position than the Vietnamese police (A), and hurried to tell him, asking him to mediate. Who knew that this Vietnamese police (B) thought that Zhu Hua was also one of the people who helped to cause trouble, not only did he not listen, but also hit Zhu Hua several times. Zhu Hua retreated after being beaten. This Vietnamese police (B) rushed forward and pulled Zhu Hua,

Walking and Hitting

Zhu Hua had nothing to do with this matter, and because he was unreasonable, he still retreated. At that time, the Vietnamese police (B) and Zhu Hua had walked to the corner of the west sidewalk of Rue Ladu and Avenue Lafayette. The Vietnamese police (B) was like a lunatic, holding Zhu Hua's right hand in one hand, and firing a shot at Zhu Hua's left rib, the bullet pierced through his abdomen. Zhu Hua was shot and fell to the ground. Later, an ambulance arrived and sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor's diagnosis, the bullet entered from the front left rib and exited from the back, with multiple perforations in the internal organs, liver, stomach, and intestines. It was impossible to save him, and he died at exactly 9:10 on the morning of the

(6th).

### Robbers Attempt to Steal Gun, Shot Hits Abdomen, Injuries Are Quite Serious, Gun is Eventually Taken by Force

Lu Guocheng, a 43-year-old guard of Rue Pére Labouré, was on duty at around 6 PM yesterday when three robbers suddenly approached him, surrounded him, and threatened him with a gun, wanting to steal the official gun he was wearing. The guard resisted, and the robbers fired a shot at the guard, the bullet hitting his left lower abdomen. He was injured and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The robbers then forcibly took his official gun (containing six bullets) and fled in different directions without a trace. Later, nearby Chinese police arrived at the scene, and the injured Lu Guocheng was taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment by car. It is said that the injuries are serious and his life is in danger.

### Car for Business Trip Robbed, Picked Up Gamblers in the Nanshi

A No. 17943 car for business trip of Xinzha Automobile Company, No. 391 Route des Soeurs, was driving empty through the intersection of Airdrome Road and Zhoujiazui Road in eastern Shanghai at 11:10 AM yesterday when two robbers suddenly blocked the way. One robber threatened the driver, Mr. A, with a gun and ordered him to get out of the car. The two robbers jumped into the car and drove west at high speed. Afterwards, the driver reported the incident to the police station in charge and requested an investigation. It is now heard that the car has been found in the Nanshi. It was picking up gamblers at the Xiyuan gambling den at the intersection of Zhonghua Road all day yesterday (She Wen News Agency).

### Robbery on Wuchang Road, Losses Exceed 10,000 Yuan

At 6:10 PM on the 9th, seven young robbers suddenly broke into the home of Cheng Qin Guan (47 years old), No. 4 Xinkang Lane, Wuchang Road. Four of them were carrying guns and forced them to hand over the safe key. Cheng Qin Guan was not at home, and there was no key left. The robbers then wanted to kidnap Cheng's two sons, Cheng Zugang (13 years old) and Cheng Zuhong (10 years old), and told them to redeem them for 40,000 yuan. Just as they were about to leave, Cheng returned home from outside. The robbers then asked him for the key and took all the cash, about 13,000 yuan, as well as rings, watches, etc., and put them in their bags. Cheng urgently wanted to report to the police station by telephone, but unexpectedly, the robbers had cut it off early. So he borrowed a phone from his neighbor and reported to the Hongkou Police Station. By the time the detectives arrived, the robbers had disappeared. They investigated the matter and made a strict investigation.

### Lawsuit over 240,000 Yuan Leather Coat: Judge Personally Inspects, Case Deemed Complex and Important, Further Hearing Ordered

Zhou Zishan, the eldest grandson of the deceased wealthy salt merchant Zhou Fujiu, married Mei Yihui (57 years old this year, from Ji'an, Jiangxi, residing at No. 20, Lane 400, Avenue Road, Public Concession). After Zishan passed away, he left behind millions in assets, all managed by Mei. This includes items held on behalf of his cousin, Zhou Pengling (22 years old this year, son of Zhou Fu-jiu's fifth son, Zhou Caicheng). When Caicheng and his wife passed away, Pengling was only eight years old. The belongings were also maintained by Mei.

Zhou Pengling has now come of age and is seeking the return of his stored leather coat boxes from Mei. Mei claims they have been used to offset debts and refuses to return them. Therefore, Zhou Pengling, alleging that Zhou Mei is bullying an orphan, recently engaged lawyer Dan Yuhua to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court's Civil Division. He seeks a judgment ordering Zhou Mei to return twenty-three boxes of leather coats or, alternatively, to compensate him with 240,000 yuan in national currency at the current market price. The case has been repeatedly heard by Judge Guo. Due to the complexity of the case, it was decided to reschedule the hearing for further testimony. Judge Guo presided over a continued hearing in the Second Civil Court. The defendant was represented by lawyer Lu Shaozong, while the plaintiff, accompanied by lawyer Dan Yuhua, strongly stated that after the plaintiff's parents passed away while he was still a child, relatives and friends inventoried and sealed over three hundred boxes of personal property, originally stored at the residence of the defendant Zhou Mei's husband, Zhou Zishan. This included twenty-three boxes of leather coats and sixteen boxes of other items. Two hundred and forty-nine boxes were stored with the second and sixth branches of the family. Due to relocation, the second and sixth branches transferred these one hundred and forty-nine boxes of stored items back to Zhou Zishan (i.e., the eldest branch). This situation can be testified to by Yang, Tianren, and Zhou Weibin. They requested that the court directly question them. Subsequently, old woman Tian Yang appeared in court and testified that Zhou Pengling's parents left behind several hundred boxes of clothing, which were later transferred to Zhou Zishan's residence. The exact number of boxes was unclear, and the box numbers were even less clear. The plaintiff's side also stated to the court that thirty-nine boxes of clothing were originally stored with the defendant. The defendant countered that eighteen boxes of leather coats were used to offset debts that Zhou Zishan had paid on behalf of the plaintiff's deceased father, eight boxes were auctioned off, and the remaining thirteen boxes were returned to the plaintiff. However, regarding the debt offsetting, the defendant was engaging in deception. The auctioned items were not from the original thirty-nine boxes stored at the defendant's residence, as can be verified by handwritten records by Zeng Duhui. Furthermore, the thirteen boxes that were retrieved were also not from the original thirty-nine boxes. The original boxes can be checked. These thirteen boxes and the auctioned items were from the two hundred and forty-nine boxes that the second and sixth branches had transferred to the defendant's residence. The court reviewed the statements and deemed it necessary to inspect the thirteen boxes that the plaintiff claimed to have retrieved. It was decided to have both parties travel by car with the judge and court clerk to the plaintiff's residence for inspection. Due to the importance of the case, it was decided to reschedule the hearing.

Lost and Found Automobile Items: Yesterday (June 6th) at approximately 8:40 PM, a black automobile traveling west on Jing'an Temple Road lost a round copper hubcap from its rear wheel near the entrance of the Temple Lane. The hubcap had the English words "Studebaker" on it. Neither the driver nor the passengers noticed. When I picked it up, the car had already driven away. The loser can claim it within ten days, every morning at No. 1624, East End of Temple Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, at Xin Taichang Store, from Mr. Zhou.

### Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor,

According to Ms. Wang Weizhen, my client, she was previously involved in a divorce lawsuit with Zhao Juzhang due to certain unfortunate circumstances. The matter was later resolved through reconciliation by relatives and friends. However, I have found that the newspaper headlines reporting on the court hearings (October 23rd and 30th) stated, "Classmate Romance Ends in Abandonment," which significantly deviates from the truth. This is because reporters cater to the general reader's interest in sensational social news, thus exaggerating the facts. Little do they know that such reporting is sufficient to damage my client's reputation. Even though the case has long been concluded, it is strange why major newspapers continue to carry such reports. I hereby request that you instruct your legal representatives to send letters to various newspapers to correct the record and restore credibility. I am sending this letter on behalf of my client, and I hope you will promptly publish it in your esteemed newspaper for clarification.

Respectfully,

Lawyer Zheng Lin-tong, November 10th

### "The Mysterious Illness"

— Shui Rong

I don't know when it started, maybe when I heard the news of the American evacuation of overseas Chinese from the Far East, our protagonist suddenly realized that something had been dug out of his body. Or maybe it's the heart. Because he vaguely felt an unusual emptiness there, probably dug up and nothing left.

From that time on, our protagonist began to secretly seek ways to fill that void. He didn't consult a doctor, because he thought that most doctors were unreliable. Their so-called "cut-flesh hearts" are only used to exploit patients, how can they cure diseases? It's better to heal yourself! He thought about going to Hong Kong, no, Manila, for a month or two. He first thought he could take everything with him, but then he thought: no! What about those real estate properties? Manila can't go. He can't go anywhere!

Isn't playing mahjong and watching dramas here also a kind of mental therapy? He "had no choice but to seek a compromise." There are plenty of mahjong partners: our protagonist has plenty of friends, social friends. There are also "subordinates"! If the boss wants to relax, the "subordinates have no choice but to accompany him. There are "experts" among the "retainers" to accompany him to watch dramas. But he's having bad luck! He loses every time he plays mahjong. The "old mahjong player" made a few jokes: grabbing a flower and forgetting to grab the "head"! The symphony of gongs, drums, and suonas seemed like something from another world to him. He only felt that the void seemed to be expanding, expanding. Before long, he became disgusted with the one hundred and thirty-six tiles and the "expert".

This development, because it was latent, was not discovered by anyone, even by our protagonist's wife, who was a confidante, and he did not want to be discovered. When receiving friends, he still laughed loudly. Maybe the laughter seemed more uninhibited than before, but this was not enough to attract the attention of his friends. When those friends thought about the increase in land prices, they thought they guessed the reason for his laughter, and echoed it with an embarrassed knowing smile. When meeting with subordinates, he still "applied both kindness and strictness". Or maybe he spoke a little louder. As for his family, he was still serious, kind, and always maintained a considerable distance from them.

But that void seemed to be gradually expanding, until one day at a banquet. That day he was particularly excited: he drank half a glass of "whiskey", and his appetite suddenly became very good. Regardless of etiquette, he ate all ten or so dishes until the bottom of the plates was visible. While wiping his mouth with a napkin, he stroked his heart with satisfaction: "Great! Great!" Suddenly, he noticed that the person sitting next to him was smiling at him, so he said peacefully: "I mean today's dishes are great. Aren't they?"

That night, when he returned home, he fell asleep soundly. Maybe it was because he was tired, or maybe that void had been filled. In short, our protagonist had a sweet sleep that he hadn't had for a long time.

The next day, when the morning light was dim, he woke up. The first action was to press his hand on his heart. The hand fell down weakly. That "mysterious illness" returned with the morning light!

He jumped out of bed, pressed the doorbell, and ordered the servants to bring breakfast. Without brushing his teeth, he began to devour it. He complained that the servants had made the breakfast too exquisite: too little bread and only a little milk. The servants were surprised and added two more servings for him.

He ate until he was out of breath, and stroked his heart. But "God bless"! "What are you doing standing here?" he roared at the stunned servant.

In this way, our protagonist continued to constantly seek ways to fill that void. Look: he is frowning alone, one hand pressed on his heart, thinking, thinking about that method...

### Seen, Heard, and Felt

— Xin Fang

One day, I ran into the public reading room of the Shanghai Municipal Council Library on Beijing Road and saw a notice in English on the newspaper rack, roughly meaning, "Each person can read a certain newspaper for no more than ten minutes, and must hand it over to others who need to read it." That can give some warning to the general selfish readers of public libraries, right?

### Escape the Sea of Suffering and Reach the Other Shore Together; Willing to Assist Those with Aspirations to Abstain from Addictions

— Yang Shaoqing

In my early years, I became addicted to smoking due to illness. After the Incident, prices soared, and living expenses continued to increase, causing me both mental and economic distress. Therefore, I made a firm decision to quit. However, at first, due to improper methods, I suffered greatly and did not succeed. This spring, through a friend's introduction, I underwent treatment at the Chinese Anti-Smoking Sanatorium. Director Jin Xuegao carefully examined my physical condition and applied both tonic and detoxifying methods, treating the disease and eliminating the addiction at the same time. In just over a month, I quit smoking without any pain, and my chronic illness was also cured. After being discharged from the hospital, my diet and weight both increased, and my body is now healthy and my mind is full of energy, a complete transformation. Since escaping the sea of suffering, I have greatly reduced my expenses, and my mind and body are at ease. I am also able to concentrate on my business operations without being afraid of complexity or hardship. The benefits to the economic aspect are certainly not small. In addition to my private joy, I am thinking of the young and promising people in society who suffer from the same illness as I did. There are quite a few people who are misled by bad habits and suffer endless harm. Those who are determined to quit are either limited by economic conditions or have not found good methods, resulting in procrastination and failure to extricate themselves. Not only is their future ruined, but society and the country also suffer losses as a result. Thinking of this, I am deeply moved. Therefore, based on the principle of establishing oneself and helping others, I am planning to rescue the hungry and the drowning. I am willing to use the money saved after quitting smoking to help those with aspirations to quit their addictions. Director Jin has also been enthusiastically supporting me, agreeing to fully fulfill his obligations in terms of technology. All expenses for medicine, food, etc., will be borne and paid by me. However, my family is not wealthy, and I can only support two people per month. All young people who are addicted to smoking, are determined to quit, and have no economic means can seek a reliable guarantor and submit a letter to Tong Taixing at No. 9 Xingsheng Street, French Concession, for registration. After passing the examination, they can be admitted to the hospital for treatment (the hospital is located at No. 454 Malang Road). The above-mentioned measures are provisionally set for one year. I know that this small amount will have a very limited effect and will not enable all compatriots who are mired in the darkness to reach the other shore. However, one person's ability is limited, and I am only doing my best. I hope that people from all walks of life will follow suit and expand and popularize it, so that the poisonous atmosphere will be eliminated, directly benefiting compatriots in the sea of suffering, and indirectly nourishing the vitality of the country and the nation. This is what I sincerely pray for.

Yang Shaoqing respectfully

Hawthorne Detective Agency

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 11 Zhao Boxiong's Confession

Shi Gui reported: "Mr. Hawthorne, there's an old man who wants to see you, he looks very strange. I asked him for a business card, but he couldn't produce one, and he wouldn't say his name."

Hawthorne stopped walking and nodded, saying, "Alright, please let him in." He then turned on the two electric lamps on the mantelpiece.

Before long, an old man with white hair and a white beard, a face full of wrinkles, wearing a wide black silk robe, walked in slowly with his head down and his back bent. The old man's shoulders were quite broad, and if his back wasn't bent, his height would probably exceed Hawthorne's. As soon as he came in, he seemed very familiar, cupping his hands repeatedly towards Hawthorne, making rough, hoarse sounds. "Mr. Hawthorne." He then turned around and cupped his hands towards me. "Mr. Bao."

I felt that the old man's manners were very attentive, and in my opinion, I had to return the courtesies. I hurriedly stood up and bowed, and just as I was about to ask his name, Hawthorne suddenly bent over and spoke before I could.

"Mr. Zhao, please sit down."

The old man's body trembled slightly. This same instinctive movement immediately affected me. Mr. Zhao? Zhao Boxiong? My hand involuntarily reached into my pocket.

Hawthorne's eyes clearly saw my action, and he said gently, "Bao Lang, take it easy. This is Mr. Zhao Boxiong. -- But this is only his temporarily assumed name. Mr. Zhao, isn't it?"

The old man suddenly chuckled. He was no longer surprised, nor did he appear flustered. "Mr. Hawthorne, I can't help but admire your eyesight. You are truly capable!" As he spoke, he sat down on a sofa in front of the desk.

Hawthorne also sat down and replied coldly, "So, your purpose in dressing like this is to give my eyes a chance to be tested?"

The fake old man Zhao Boxiong quickly interjected, "No, Mr. Hawthorne, you misunderstand. To be honest, I wouldn't dare come out of Fengtai without this disguise, for fear of encountering unnecessary trouble. The thin man you sent to follow me is indeed very capable. I only realized that someone was watching outside the store when I arrived at Fengtai. I admire him. He followed me all the way, and I didn't even notice." (16)

### Are Cosmetics a Waste?

— Li

Some people say that buying cosmetics is a waste, but in fact, it is not absolutely accurate.

Of course, if we imitate many European and American women and put a group of cosmetics on the dressing table, and bandage the face and neck at night as if someone has suffered an accidental injury, it is not necessary. However, by using cosmetics to express inherent advantages and conceal unattractive flaws, it seems that women can retain this right.

A woman in love, through the help of cosmetics, becomes a lifelong companion with her lover, gives birth to promising children, and is able to do some work for the country, then this kind of beauty work is very meaningful.

A clever wife, using cosmetics to maintain her beauty for a long time, so that her husband will not go out and wander, then the price paid for cosmetics becomes a useful investment.

Moreover, according to the true principles of beauty, the entire part of beauty work also includes the two necessary conditions of health and cleanliness. To obtain the true effect of beauty, the first step is to ensure that there is no dirt in the pores of our skin, and that each cell of our skin is full of vitality. This basic work is very important for the health of our whole body, so because the use of cosmetics, the implementation of beauty indirectly promotes the health of the body, the benefits obtained are more than the money spent.

Therefore, if we recognize the goal and do not buy blindly, cosmetics are not a waste. And the publication of this magazine is not a waste of ink either.

### Psychological Beauty Work

— Fangfei

Don't let the pain of life be depicted on your face

In this complex era of personnel affairs, it is not enough to carry out beauty work only from the surface, because there is also a psychological aspect that cannot be ignored.

No matter how young and beautiful you are, everyday life will often leave a deep phenomenon on your face. We mostly have a special facial expression, and let our emotions—troubles, fears, or joys—show on the face. Just look at those middle-aged women, there are often many wrinkles on their faces, so never think that you are in the best period of youth, prevention is a very important work.

The beauty of youth on the face is expressed in the eyes, so you must not ignore the beauty of the eyes. Don't narrow your eyes when looking at things, because this action easily forms an aging appearance.

Don't often frown, because after getting used to it, it will not only damage your appearance, but also harm your character. Squinting should also be avoided. If you need it under the light, then it doesn't matter to wear glasses, don't squint your eyes. If you read a lot or do delicate handicrafts, you should have enough light.

If you are often frowning, you should develop the habit of smiling, because smiling can remove wrinkles on your forehead. Many people tend to wrinkle their nose when they smile, which is irrelevant when they are young, or even beautiful, but at a certain time, unpleasant lines will appear on the nose.

Now let's talk about the mouth: Do you deliberately manipulate your lips when you speak or listen to others? Or make all kinds of gestures with your mouth? Or bite your lip? These situations should not be allowed to continue, because they will change the texture of your mouth.

It is best to study yourself every so often, and you will have many discoveries: Are you feeling tired? Are you unwilling to attend any banquets? You should think about increasing your energy, or because you lack a certain vitamin. In this case, it is best to see a doctor, because many people often lose their beauty due to physical weakness.

Sometimes when you are researching, you will find that the decline in facial beauty is due to the feet. According to scientific records, wearing a pair of shoes that are too tight will often show a painful appearance on the face, and this pain is also very harmful to the nervous system.

Speaking of nerves, you may become restless because of disappointment or stimulation, and thus become irritable and sleepless at night. This phenomenon can immediately be expressed on your face. Of course, we cannot restrain emotions and prevent them from being expressed on the face, but it is actually possible to find ways to reduce this pain.

Troubles can cause wrinkles around the eyes, and sorrow often shows its existence from the mouth and eyes. The most damaging thing to appearance is fear. To avoid these emotions of trouble, sorrow, and fear, you can analyze the facts. There are really many things that are not worth worrying, being sad, or being afraid of.

Therefore, to obtain true beauty, in addition to using appropriate cosmetics, it is also necessary to maintain a healthy body and restrain emotions that damage beauty.

### Talking about Skin Nutrition

— Ling Naiping

If the metabolism of your subcutaneous cells is abnormal, then the appearance of your skin will inevitably be loose, wrinkled, dry, rough, and dark. Even due to the decline in skin color, even though you are still young, you will lose your youthful grace. But in this current era of 20th-century scientific omnipotence, there is no need to worry, because nutritional and healthy skin beauty products have been launched. For example, "Pehchaolin," the latest product of Changbeikang Cosmetics Co., Ltd., is a skin agent specially designed to nourish skin cells, supply subcutaneous fat, cleanse the dirt in pores, and shrink pores. According to experience, it is best to apply "Pehchaolin" all over the face and hands before going to bed, because its pore-cleansing work can exert its effectiveness even more. For daytime application, it can be used as a foundation, and at the same time, it can protect against the invasion of climate and prevent the skin from being stimulated by sun and wind. This will not only nourish and protect your skin, but also promote the foundation of your beauty—fair skin and creamy texture, so that your youth will last forever, even if you are older, your grace must not

### Talking about Perming

— Jing

If someone says to you: "Your hair is permed as if it were natural," this is really not a compliment. Because a truly beautiful perm should be natural. To make the results of a perm good, there are several prerequisites: First, the hair must be in perfect condition. Before perming, there should be several days of combing, brushing, and applying oil; Second, the shampoo used when washing hair before perming is also very important. The nature of this shampoo should not be too strong, because after being too strong, it will wash away the oil in the scalp, and this oil is very precious.

Many people think that hair will return to its original state after being permed, but this is not the case. A well-permed hair can remain curly for a long time. Of course, the hair is growing, so the curly part droops down and is soon cut off. There are several types of perming machines, and the latest one can avoid contact with hair, which is called "wireless perm." Using chemicals, placing them on the hair, after a considerable period of time, the hair becomes wavy.

The time required for perming has been greatly reduced. Thirty years ago, Charles Nestle, who first invented the first perming machine, used it for the first time in London. It took eight to ten hours to perm the hair of a woman, so he only permed 72 times from 1905 to 1909. The current rate is different. In various countries of England and America, 37.5 million perms are performed every year. In the beginning, many members of the royal family had suffered eight to ten hours of torture under Nestle's hands, and the price of each perm was 250 US dollars. Compared with the present, that is a world of difference.

After perming, hairbrushes should be used every day, which can make the curly shape more beautiful and make the hair softer and prevent hair loss. But be sure not to use hot water to comb your hair. The proper way is to use hair oil. Secondly, when perming, you may wish to do some experimental work and try your hair to see which style is best for perming.

### Wartime Beauty Products for German Women

In wartime Germany, women are no longer allowed to use soap, creams, or milk for beauty treatments. However, the preservation of women's beauty has not been neglected. Ms. Luo Mei, a beauty expert from the German Labor Front, has provided the following items for German women:

1.  Since soap cannot be used, ivy leaves are a good substitute because they can be used for outdoor bathing.

2.  Washing the face with milk is no longer possible. This can be replaced with rainwater mixed with wild chestnut juice. The method involves peeling the wild chestnuts, drying them in the sun, grinding them, cooking them, and adding water to create an excellent face wash.

3.  As for the vitamins needed by the body, one can eat cabbage, carrots, celery, and apples.

### Various Perfumes

— Wei Min

Among cosmetics, perfume occupies a very important position. Making perfume is truly an art rather than a science. If two printers print the same photograph, the results will never be the same. Similarly, if two perfume makers use the same raw materials, they will never produce the same perfume.

Because perfume production is not easy, the cost of perfume is very high. For example, with jasmine, the flowers must be picked in the morning while the early dew is still on them. Then, the petals are placed in a dish lined with wax. The next day, the petals are discarded, and newly picked petals are added. This process is repeated every day for an entire season. Then, the flower oil is extracted from the wax. To make two pounds of flower oil, 25,000 pounds of fresh flowers are needed. Therefore, the value of these two pounds of flower oil can reach US$700 to $800. This type of oil is often placed in metal boxes and preserved like jewelry.

Many people apply perfume directly to their skin, but this is not appropriate because some people's skin is acidic. When perfume touches the skin, a chemical reaction occurs, and the fragrance immediately disappears. Therefore, it is best to apply perfume to clothing. The lapel and cuffs are very suitable places. Never apply perfume to the hair because the oils in some people's hair cannot mix with the oils in the perfume. This is the same principle as why perfume should not be applied to fur.

After purchasing perfume, its preservation is very important. Each bottle should be tightly stoppered to avoid light and heat. Otherwise, your perfume will disappear invisibly in a very short period. If you find that the perfume has a cloudy appearance, then you can be sure that someone has stolen some and added water.

### Beauty Tidbits

Here are many methods that may be useful for reference:

To make teeth white, in addition to daily toothpaste, you can use lemon juice and salt to brush your teeth once a week. When using lipstick, if you use a deep red lipstick, it can make your teeth appear very white.

When the skin on your hands appears purple or brown, you can rub it with sweet potato to make the skin white and tender immediately.

Brief News: Lincoln Medicinal Toothpaste, well-known in the market, has been sold in China for nearly three years. Because of its low price and high quality, it is popular everywhere and praised by word of mouth. Recently, the company initiated a "brushing teeth before bedtime movement," widely advocating it through letters, which is very beneficial for oral hygiene.

Yesterday, I happened to meet Mr. Zhu, the Chinese manager of the company, who informed me that Lincoln Little Tuo Rouge, which the company has been preparing for a long time, will also be launched on the market within the next ten days. In addition, soaps, powders, hair wax, and cold creams for both winter and summer will also be available to the public one after another.

The snow creams popular on the market are often crudely made, and it is difficult to distinguish their quality and fragrance. Only the Sister Cream produced by the Jiangsheng Chemical Factory has a particularly great effect. After washing the face and before going to bed, once applied, the skin immediately becomes moisturized and delicate. If you then apply the Four Blessings Brand Modern Fragrant Powder produced by the same factory, it will be absorbed and adhered, making your face radiant. It is sold at department stores and pharmacies in various cities.

When you want to put on makeup, have you ever thought about who taught you how to do it? Now, I would like to introduce you to a book called "The Book of Beauty." There is a "Beauty Memorandum" in it that will teach you complete and practical makeup methods. Furthermore, this book also contains ten kinds of exquisite cosmetics, such as creams, powders, lipsticks, and eyebrow pencils, for you to experiment with (because this book is also a novel cosmetic case). Then, you will surely be able to apply makeup in a very charming way!

### Hollywood Beauty Experts Tell You How to Measure Your Face

Whether your face meets the standards is perhaps a question you are very eager to know. Now, Hollywood beauty expert Weiss Moore has developed a method for you. Why not try it?

Take a Photo

The first step is to take a photo. When taking the photo, you should look straight at the camera (or choose an appropriate one from all your photos, but do not choose a photo with the face turned diagonally or upward, because it is very difficult to do measurements with a non-frontal photo).

The second step is to draw two straight lines and three horizontal lines on the first picture on the left. You can then see the entire area of your face.

Is Your Forehead Too High?

After you have drawn the lines on your photo, you can see if your forehead is too high. If it is too high, then you can comb your hair lower, covering part of the forehead with hair.

If the distance between your eyes and hair is less than the distance between your eyes and lips, then you should comb your hair higher.

Is Your Mouth Too Narrow or Too Wide?

To judge whether your mouth is too narrow or too wide, you can smile in front of a mirror. The corners of your mouth when smiling should align with the center of your pupils (see the second picture). If the mouth is too narrow or too wide, you can use lipstick to remedy the natural shortcomings.

People with lips that are too wide can apply lipstick thicker in the middle of the mouth and then fade it outward. If the mouth is too narrow, then you can apply lipstick more narrowly.

Do Not Let the Lines Droop

In the third picture, you can see the lines of the face: eyebrows, eyes, or lips. When applying makeup, never let these lines droop, because after drooping, it will show a look of worry, which will cause unlimited damage to the beauty of the entire face.
