### Britain Officially Notifies Japan: Reopening of the Burma Road on the 18th; Churchill Simultaneously Announces in the House of Commons: Anglo-Japanese Relations Will Undergo a Sharp Change

London – Prime Minister Churchill, during his speech in the House of Commons today regarding the war situation, stated that upon the expiration of the current Anglo-Japanese agreement to blockade the Burma Road, the road will be reopened. He said, "Three months ago, we were asked to blockade this road because we sincerely wished to provide an opportunity for the Chinese and Japanese governments to reach a fair resolution to their long-standing dispute. Therefore, we agreed. Unfortunately, such a resolution has not been achieved, and the prolonged war of conquest by the Japanese against the Chinese nation continues unabated. Although we deeply regret the missed opportunity, the British government, under all circumstances, insists on maintaining the agreement until October 17th. However, beyond this date, we see no reason for its continuation." He also stated that Japan's recent accession to the Tripartite Pact seems quite unfavorable to Japan. He wondered if there might be some secret clauses. It is difficult to understand how Germany and Italy will assist Japan. This pact is directly aimed at the United States, and secondarily at the Soviet Union, but Britain and the United States never yield to threats. (Reuters, 8th)

Today, Britain formally notified Japan that it has decided to reopen the Burma Road on October 18th. The Foreign Ministry announced at 5 PM that British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie, acting on instructions from his government, paid a special visit to Foreign Minister Matsuoka. It is said that the British government sees no reason why it should not reopen the Burma Road after the expiration of the Anglo-Japanese agreement on the blockade of the Burma Road. Regarding this point, all parties believe that Anglo-Japanese relations will undergo a rapid change. Since Japan has already signed the Tripartite Alliance and declared its determination to suppress countries aiding China, Britain's reopening of this important trade route to China will inevitably be seen as a hostile act towards Japan. It is also expressed here that the reopening of the Burma Road will also worsen Japanese-American relations. The Japanese believe that Britain's attitude is provoking America, and the U.S. cannot escape its responsibility. (Associated Press, 8th)

Tokyo – According to a statement released by the Foreign Ministry, British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie met with Foreign Minister Matsuoka this morning to inform him that Britain would not continue the agreement to blockade the Burma Road. The statement was very brief, and officials declined to comment, but a formal protest is expected. It is noted that last week, Japanese newspapers strongly hinted at the possibility of Japanese aircraft bombing the Burma Road from bases in Vietnam. The Japanese all believe that Britain's notice to reopen the Burma Road will not affect Britain's ban on military and other supplies from passing through Hong Kong to China. The Japan Times believes that Britain's decision to reopen the only remaining artery for supplies to Chongqing is intended to save face before the Chinese and to assist Chongqing as a force to resist Japan jointly with the United States. It is generally expected that Japan's reasons for protesting Britain's decision will be that it violates the spirit of the three-month blockade agreement between the two countries, as its content contained a tacit understanding regarding the possibility of extending the blockade. Japan may further consider this move to be a violation of the letter and spirit of the Arita-Craigie Agreement of last year, according to which Britain recognized Japan's special position and needs in China and declared no intention of assisting Japan's enemies.

British Ambassador Visits Soviet Foreign Minister to Review the Entire Far Eastern Situation

London – Reuters learned last night that British Prime Minister Churchill will deliver a speech on the Burma Road issue in the coming days. The Anglo-Japanese agreement, which expires on October 17th, stipulates that during the effective period of this agreement, efforts should be made to achieve a general resolution to the Far Eastern question. Now that Japan is not moving in this direction but is advancing into Vietnam in an attempt to attack China from the side, and has formed a Tripartite Alliance against Britain,

### U.S. Intensifies Economic Sanctions Against Japan

Tokyo – According to the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun," after the United States bans the import of copper, steel, coal, oil, and other items to Japan, it will ban the import of Japanese raw silk to the United States. However, Japanese-American relations will not necessarily break down because of this. This measure only constitutes one element in the various factors leading to a severance of Japanese-American relations. The newspaper hopes that India and Australia will join the Far Eastern economic bloc. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)

New York – Starting today, voters in all cities in the United States (except those with a population of less than 5,000) will begin the registration process. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)the British government, while studying the path that Britain should take after the expiration of the existing agreement, has been in close contact with the United States. It is generally recognized that most of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance is aimed at the United States. The rumor that the Japanese side requested an extension of the agreement period has not been confirmed. Tokyo has recently issued statements believing that it is possible for the Japanese army to conduct military operations from Vietnam, and the Burma Road is within the bombing range, so this road cannot be used. It is therefore suspicious that British Prime Minister Churchill will announce the opening of the Burma Road when the agreement expires. Since the policies of Britain and the United States toward the Far East are the same, and the governments of the two countries are constantly exchanging views, it can now be concluded that Britain has notified the United States of its opinion on reopening the Burma Road. (Reuters, 8th)

London – It was announced here last night that British Ambassador to Moscow Sir Stafford Cripps held a lengthy discussion with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on Friday night of last week. It is believed that the British Ambassador expressed to the Soviet Foreign Minister that the British government has decided to reopen the Yunnan-Burma Road on October 17th. It is also speculated that these diplomats will also review the entire Far Eastern situation after Japan joined the Tripartite Alliance. (Associated Press, 8th)

London – Japanese Ambassador to Britain Mamoru Shigemitsu had a long conversation with British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Rab Butler yesterday. This was Mamoru Shigemitsu's first visit to the British Foreign Office since Japan signed the Tripartite Alliance Treaty. It is generally understood that the matters discussed between the two did not go beyond the scope of the Tripartite Alliance and Anglo-Japanese relations. It is believed that Rab Butler informed the Japanese Ambassador of Britain's decision to reopen the Yunnan-Burma Road, but the formal official notification will be delivered to the Japanese government by British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie. (Associated Press, 8th)

### Roosevelt to Announce U.S. Foreign Policy on the Weekend; British Ambassador Has Long Talk with U.S. Secretary of State; Plans for Cooperation Between the Two Countries in the Far East Determined

After the meeting, the British Ambassador told reporters that he and Mr. Hull had "fully exchanged information on the world situation," but he declined to disclose the content of the discussion. Some observers believe that yesterday's meeting was to make the final decision on the plan for cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East. This plan may be announced this week by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill. President Roosevelt will issue an important statement on American foreign policy this Saturday, and Prime Minister Churchill is also preparing to speak to the House of Commons this week. The British Ambassador told reporters yesterday that he has not yet received official notification of Britain's decision to reopen the Yunnan-Burma Road in order to transport war materials to the Chongqing government. (Associated Press, 8th)

Washington – Yesterday, diplomatic activities here focused on the Far Eastern situation. After British Ambassador Lord Lothian went to the State Department to talk with Hull, he was unwilling to disclose what they discussed, including whether it included the Burma Road opening issue. Shortly thereafter, Under Secretary of State Welles received French Ambassador Henry-Haye, while Secretary of the Navy Knox visited U.S. Naval Commander-in-Chief Richardson, reportedly to discuss "routine naval events," but these events are of course related to the Pacific. (Reuters, 8th)

Washington – U.S. Fleet Commander-in-Chief Admiral Richardson, after arriving here by plane from San Francisco, met here yesterday with Secretary of the Navy Knox. Afterwards, Secretary Knox told people that what he had received was "the fleet's daily report." Knox said, "We also discussed the situation in the Pacific and all matters concerning the expansion of the U.S. Navy." Also participating in the meeting were Under Secretary of the Navy Forrestal and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Compton. (Associated Press, 8th)

Washington – U.S. Navy leaders at sea and on land met with Secretary of the Navy Knox yesterday to discuss the urgent situation in the Pacific and the procedures for expanding the two-ocean fleet. Secretary of State Hull, who holds meetings almost daily, and the leaders of the British and Australian embassies also held a meeting yesterday, given the importance of the Far Eastern situation. After Knox and his subordinates finished their discussions, officials said, "The fleet's routine reports have been received, the Pacific situation has been discussed, and matters concerning naval expansion have also been discussed." At the same time, it was heard from official sources that the Axis powers will immediately take new actions in the Far East, but what kind of actions they are is still unclear. (International News Service, 7th)

Tokyo – The Asahi Shimbun published an editorial today stating that since Japan announced the New Order in East Asia, Britain and the United States have maintained strong opposition, which is well known to everyone. We naturally do not want to cause unnecessary conflicts, but it is also certain that our process will never succeed because of this opposition. The Tripartite Alliance is indeed what we urgently need. (Reuters, 8th)

Tokyo – Japanese newspapers today reiterated Japan's determination to "disregard" British and American "interference" in the Far East and to promote Japan's "Greater East Asia New Order" plan, regardless of the consequences. The Asahi Shimbun expressed its approval of Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka's speech here yesterday. The Foreign Minister said, "Japan will never let the obstacles of Britain and the United States defeat our purpose." The newspaper said, "What we can do is only to move forward purposefully and never allow anyone to stop us." The newspaper also said that after Japan expressed its intention to establish a "New Order in East Asia," Britain immediately decided on its actions based on its "deep-rooted theory of maintaining the status quo." The newspaper continued, "Why the work of coexistence and co-prosperity that Japan is carrying out in this region is so strongly opposed by Britain and the United States is really puzzling."

### U.S.-Soviet Talks Continue: Discussing Improving Relations Between the Two Countries

Washington – The talks between U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles and Soviet Ambassador to the United States Oumansky, which began in August, suddenly continued last night, arousing a new speculation that the Soviet Union may not approve of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance. These talks began two months ago, and Welles had discussed reforming Soviet-American relations with the Soviet Ambassador several times, but then stopped. (Reuters, 8th)

Editorial

### Reviewing the Attitude of the Soviet Union

The international situation has developed to its current stage. The conflict will inevitably erupt into a world war. But observing the situation on all sides, although the tensions are close to the extreme, a world war is not imminent at the moment. This is because the actual preparations and arrangements of various countries have not yet been completed; and the evolution of the Soviet Union from its current attitude to a clear state cannot be expected too hastily. The Soviet Union is extremely cautious, and the countries are taking the Soviet Union as the core of their pursuit: probably the day the pursuit becomes clear will be the time when the war begins!

No one can predict what attitude the Soviet Union will take until the eve of the start of the war, but we might as well review from the beginning and analyze from the side to try to understand the truth. It is not necessary to say it too far. From the conclusion of the so-called Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany and Japan in November 1926, one year later to the participation of Italy in the agreement in November of the following year: in the past three or four years, the Soviet Union's diplomatic dealings with these three countries can be said to be step by step success. Originally, after Stalin took over, the Soviet Union devoted itself wholeheartedly to domestic construction, and what he urgently needed was peace. Germany, Italy, and Japan were awed and concluded an anti-communist pact, intending to cooperate with each other and prevent the destructive work of the Third International; that is, the Soviet Union's activities in the international arena, while winning the sympathy of anti-Soviet elements in Britain and the United States, to cover up its growing military aggression. The Soviet Union saw through this point, and in order to protect its own existence, it could not be excluded from the international stage, and waited for the anti-Soviet front to become strong and consolidated. It could not sit and wait for the final offensive; therefore, it also became active in various ways diplomatically. Over the past three or four years, the Soviet Union has actively developed its functions under various slogans such as "peace diplomacy," "collective security," "aid to just wars," and "opposition to imperialist wars," and has passively avoided crises in its foreign relations. Until today, its gains are: (1) The Soviet Union has still not been dragged into the wars in Asia and Europe. (2) Its own strong material foundation has been laid firmly and consolidated. (3) It has established a sincere and trustworthy friendly foundation with China in the East and Turkey in the South; moreover, it has built a strong outer line on its border, from the Arctic Ocean all the way to the Black Sea. (4) From an isolated and dangerous situation, it has, through the years, and through several transformations, reached a position of importance, becoming the target of pursuit by all parties. These four points alone, even those who deeply hate it, cannot help but admire its success! How did it achieve this success? It can (1) take advantage of the contradictions between "having" colonial countries and "not having" colonial countries. (2) Play up the contradictions between aggressors and small and weak countries. (3) Especially important is to grasp the contradictions "having" colonial powers and "not having" colonial powers. In simple terms, the victory of Soviet diplomacy over the past three or four years has been completely entrusted to the multifaceted complexity of the entire international relationship in space, and the staggered circumstances in time.

At this stage, Germany, Italy, and Japan have formally announced their alliance. At least in the next few years (not necessarily ten), the three countries will inevitably advance and retreat together, simplifying an important link in the complexity of the international situation. The Soviet Union's actions and policies toward these three countries will be forced to gradually converge; there will eventually be a time when it will not be a full friend or an enemy to the three countries. Following behind the three countries, joining the group, and becoming one of the partners in the spoils; helping them create a rural environment that fundamentally violates the basic principles of one's own founding, but isolating oneself in the extreme right-wing fire, eventually turning against each other and becoming the final fate. What is comprehensive "neutrality"? If the three countries gradually gain power, they will inevitably demand that the Soviet Union stop aiding China, sever friendly relations with Turkey, and cut off the connection between the United States and the Soviet Union. At that time, if the Soviet Union takes temporary security as a good plan and still touts "neutrality," then the day it accepts the demands will immediately be tantamount to willingly withdrawing from the international stage, and then sitting and waiting for others to determine the outcome and then bowing down to accept the judgment against oneself.

The above two paths are by no means an overestimation, nor a dangerous statement. There is indeed rich potential in between. Some say that the Soviet Union is not only extremely cautious but also extremely smart. He has superhuman foresight and ingenious calculations: for example, now it may be possible to promote the infighting of the capitalist world from the side, and at the appropriate time, easily reap greater benefits; is this not the best strategy? Why bother to distinguish between friends and enemies now? The key lies in the strength of the Soviet Union in the front? Transcending national boundaries, the comments of social war its rights or wrongs. But, when a country has launched or is facing a national war, social war is eliminated by national consciousness: Therefore, the possibility of world revolution is smaller than the possibility of a world war. This will at least be the case for the next decade or two. In small terms, the Soviet-Finnish War last year can be a good example. The Soviet Union has long discovered this theory, that revolution is not something that can be transplanted; it is impossible for a country to have a revolution by external force alone, let alone make the whole world! It can be seen that taking over and making plans for the Soviet Union is absolutely impossible.

If the previous argument is not wrong, then the future between the Soviet Union and Germany, Italy, and Japan must conclude with complete hostility. On the fundamental direction of hostility, will the Soviet Union join hands with Britain and the United States, or partially join hands? Join hands immediately, or join hands in the future? This is the only remaining fork in the road at the moment!

Japan Plans Expansion: Vietnam Occupied Areas; Five Vietnamese Generals Dismissed; French Commander Martin Also Included; France Explains Relations with Thailand: Will Cede Some Fertile Islands

Hanoi – Japanese military authorities here stated last night that Japan may soon find it necessary to request an increase in the scope of use of Vietnamese airports, and Japanese officials also stated that Japanese troops in Vietnam will request credit loans from Vietnam to maintain the Japanese garrison there. Regarding these two points, the French authorities believe that Japan has already violated the Franco-Japanese agreement, and Japan's intentions will naturally be put into action. At present, the Japanese army in Vietnam has already concentrated 40 aircraft at the Gia Lam airfield and stationed 60 mechanical infantrymen there as local garrison troops. From here to Haiphong, electric wires have been installed to strengthen communications. The French authorities pointed out that Japan has actually controlled the entire Tonkin region. In addition, the French side has denied reports that Thai troops have crossed the Vietnamese border. (Associated Press, 8th)

Vichy – The Secretary-General of the French Foreign Ministry yesterday explained to this agency's Vichy correspondent the relationship between France and Thailand, saying that the French government has notified Thailand's representative in Paris that the Mekong River is the natural border between Thailand and Vietnam, and what should be negotiated is about the northern part of the Mekong River. France has expressed its willingness to cede some very fertile islands to Thailand, although France is still willing to sign a non-aggression treaty with Thailand due to the tensions between the two countries. The request to cede the lower Mekong River and Cambodian provinces is unacceptable to France. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)

Vichy – A semi-official document declared that the Vichy government rejected Thailand's new demands earlier this month, including the cession of all British territory on the right bank of the Mekong River, and guaranteed that if French sovereignty over the two protectorates of Laos and Cambodia were to be transferred to a third country, the two territories would be ceded to Thailand. Previously, Thailand only requested the transfer of some Mekong River islands.

The French side claimed that the victim was Vietnamese. (Reuters, 8th)

### U.S. Advises Far East Nationals to Withdraw, Saying It Is a Precautionary Measure; Most U.S. Nationals in Japan Voluntarily Leaving; China Believes the U.S. and Japan Will Eventually Clash

Washington. Today, the official announcement stated that the U.S. Department of State has instructed all U.S. consulates in the Far East to notify all U.S. nationals in China, Japan, "Manchukuo," Hong Kong, and Vietnam to return home as soon as possible. The Department of State confirmed that all American men, women, and children, if they do not have necessary and urgent business, will be advised to leave the Far East. It is reported that U.S. consulates in the Far East will issue this notice in the middle of this week. This action by the U.S. Department of State is purely a precautionary plan and is not due to any special situation. It is also reported that the U.S. Asiatic Fleet will also instruct the families of all naval officers to return to the U.S. as soon as possible. (Associated Press telegram from the 8th)

Tokyo. According to investigations, U.S. nationals in Japan have not yet been notified by the U.S. authorities to withdraw, but most Americans have already left Japan voluntarily or are preparing to return to the U.S. (Associated Press telegram from the 8th)

Manila. U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, recently commented on the U.S. State Department's order to U.S. consulates in China, Japan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, etc., to notify Americans to evacuate the Far East, saying that this should not be regarded as an indication of serious difficulties to come. This is merely a precautionary measure to avoid unnecessary difficulties for Americans in the event of an accident. (Associated Press telegram from the 8th)

Chongqing. People here recently believe that the U.S. State Department's decision to evacuate U.S. nationals in the Far East is the prelude to a future war between Japan and the U.S. Well-informed sources said that tensions between the U.S. and Japan have reached a point where any unfortunate event could happen at any time. The news that U.S. consulates in various parts of China will soon notify U.S. nationals to evacuate has attracted much attention here. (Associated Press telegram from the 8th)

Chongqing. Observers here believe that the U.S. and Japan will inevitably clash, and it is only a matter of time, either after the November general election or next spring. It is generally believed that the outcome of the U.S. presidential election may not have any impact on developments in the Far East, because American public opinion is united on foreign policy, regardless of whether the ruling party is Republican or Democratic. General public opinion here believes that international developments are now gradually favoring China. The U.S. is superior to Japan in terms of resources, as well as naval and air force strength. If Japan and the U.S. go to war, the resolution will be very rapid. The outcome can be decided by only a few naval battles in the Pacific. The editorial of the Central Daily News pointed out that the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan is an alliance of aggression, whose main purpose is to destroy British interests in China. The newspaper said that one of the most important reasons for the alliance is that Germany and Japan want to create shocking moves to divert the attention of their people and cover up their failure to attack Britain and their unfavorable war against China. As for the third clause of the alliance, the countries outside the war that can influence the outcome of the war are the U.S. and the Soviet Union. (Judging from its text, it is aimed at the United States, and judging from its intention, it is also to prevent the Soviet Union from participating in the war on the side of the Allied countries, in order to concentrate its efforts to deal with China, Britain, and the United States. Germany, Italy, and Japan are now trying to appease the Soviet Union. Their first task is to prevent the United States from participating in the war, and the second is to prevent the Soviet Union from assisting China and Britain.) According to predictions by observers here, the reopening of the Burma Road on October 17 will be the starting point for the rapid and decisive development of the Far East situation. Japan will definitely exert maximum pressure on British and American land and interests in the Far East, or may take action against Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. At the same time, Japan will also use the settlement of Vietnam and Luoluo to attack Burma, in order to block the passage of supplies to China, and to spy on Singapore, the most important naval port in the Far East. At that time, Chinese troops may be transferred to Burma to help Britain defend, and the U.S. fleet will definitely impose sanctions on Japan to ensure the safety of Singapore. (Reuters telegram from the 6th)

### Manila Stock Prices Fall; U.S. Withdrawal of Nationals from the Far East Has Made a Deep Impression

Manila. This afternoon, the news that the U.S. authorities will advise American nationals in Japan, China, Hong Kong, Manchuria, Korea, etc., to return home has already made a deep impression. The stock market fell sharply at closing, reaching as much as half. The families of naval and military personnel are all discussing this with each other. However, spokespersons from both the navy and the army said that the families of U.S. troops here may not have to evacuate immediately, but those living in China are very likely. Also, most of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet is currently anchored here. (Associated Press telegram from the 8th)

### Various Chinese Agencies in Hong Kong Stop Withdrawing to the Philippines

Hong Kong. Some Chinese government agencies, banks, and other enterprises here had planned to withdraw to Manila, but since the establishment of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, Manila is no longer considered a safer place than Hong Kong or Singapore. Therefore, the original plan has been abandoned by the Tripartite Pact. When the Japanese army occupied Shenzhen twice last August and this July, threatening Hong Kong, the Chinese side considered the Philippines to be a safe place in the East. Some Chinese government agencies have already established branches in Manila. If it were not for the Axis powers, they would have all moved there long ago. Chinese opinion here is that the new alliance treaty is fundamentally and directly aimed at the United States. Therefore, if war breaks out in the Pacific, the Philippines will be in a dangerous situation. It is generally believed that Hong Kong's land defenses are stronger than those of the Philippines, and aggressors will have to pay a higher price to attack. It is possible that part of the U.S. fleet in Hawaii may be dispatched to the Philippines. However, at that time, war in the Philippines is more likely to break out, and the place will not be a haven for Chinese capital and business. Chinese capital had previously flowed into the Philippines, but now Filipinos are not very enthusiastic about welcoming Chinese capital because of the development of Chinese businesses. At the same time, with the establishment of a new alliance of totalitarian states, the inflow of Chinese capital into the Philippines has now stopped.

### German Planes Again Launch Massive Attacks on Britain Yesterday; 13 Districts of London Are Badly Bombed; German Air Force Changes Strategy and Engages in Extensive Activities; British Air Force Raids Berlin for Four Hours

London. Last night, London was subjected to extremely heavy bombing again. Although the momentum of the attack subsided slightly after midnight, last night's air raid was the most intense since the start of the war. Yesterday, at least 13 areas in the city of London and at least several areas in the outskirts of London were bombed. A large department store in London was hit by a "Molotov breadbasket" containing countless bombs and suffered very severe damage. Last night, as the German raiders approached London, British fighter planes were patrolling the skies around London. However, the German planes immediately dispersed and flew all over the sky over the outskirts. Some of the raiders managed to break through into the city and drop bombs in many places. According to British military officers, the anti-aircraft fire fired by British artillery at that time was the most intense since the war. Countless searchlights were also heavily active, illuminating German planes over the city center from afar. British fighter planes were fighting with newly arrived squadrons of German planes in the skies over the outskirts. At the same time, bombs fell in a certain area in southeastern Scotland, a certain town in Scotland, and various towns behind the northeastern coast, and a certain inland area. The German planes bombing these places hovered in the sky for a long time without fear of fierce anti-aircraft fire. Last night's aerial activity in London was most intense in the hours before the German planes launched their attack. However, after midnight, the momentum of the raiders suddenly decreased. After 1:00 AM, only occasional sounds of German planes flying could be heard. The German planes first launched a blitz air war against Britain on September 7. Therefore, yesterday's frenzy was exactly the first day after the one-month anniversary of the blitz air war. According to an announcement by the Air Ministry at 8:00 PM yesterday, 27 German planes had been shot down over England yesterday, while the British lost 13 planes. Six of the airmen were safe. Shortly after the air raid sirens sounded last night, two large high-explosive bombs fell in the area around a certain famous intersection in London. Although houses were bombed and collapsed, no one was injured. Traffic was also not obstructed by the piles of debris. At 8:00 PM, another residential area was hit by four bombs. The four bombs made a sharp, strange noise when they landed, as if they were dropped by a single German plane outside the range of British searchlights. At 7:55 PM, many incendiary bombs fell in a certain area in central London, but the fire caused by the bombs was brought under control within minutes. German planes concentrated over central London at one time, flying very high and beyond the reach of searchlights. These German planes flew in from all directions and arrived in central London in groups of three or five, then released large quantities of lethal and destructive straight-drop bombs. There were some casualties in yesterday's daylight air raid. At that time, a bomb fell almost directly into a public air-raid shelter in a certain town in the west. Various residential areas of London were also bombed during the daylight air raid. According to a joint communique from the Air Ministry and the Department of Internal Security yesterday evening, German planes attempted to raid London five times yesterday, with a total of 450 planes participating. Large squadrons of British fighter planes fought with the scattered enemy planes. German planes broke into London twice, but dropped very few bombs. According to reports as of 5:00 PM, several houses in the eastern and southern parts of London have been destroyed. Although several people were bombed to death, the casualties did not seem to be very heavy. There was also some minor damage and casualties in several towns and cities in Eastbourne, Dover, and Canterbury. This afternoon, southwestern England was attacked twice. According to British newspapers, a single German plane machine-gunned the streets of Eastbourne during the scattered air raid by German planes yesterday, flying very low when it carried out the attack, but no one was injured. Several of the German planes were fighter planes, each carrying one bomb. After dropping their bombs, these planes, which combined fighting and bombing, released their speed and demonstrated their fighter plane capabilities. (Associated Press telegram from the 8th)

Berlin. From Monday night to Tuesday morning, British bombers broke through strong anti-aircraft fire, causing German warehouses and railway buildings to suffer terrible air strikes. Although dozens of cannons on the ground in Berlin fired simultaneously, shaking with sound, the British planes still crossed the thick fire net and rushed into the skies over Berlin, making the German capital the longest attack since the start of the war, causing fires in several areas of the vast area. The British plane squadrons flew swiftly over Berlin around midnight and began dropping incendiary bombs and exploding bombs. The British planes moved nimbly, so the German defense aircraft failed to drive them away. The all-clear was not sounded until four hours and forty-three minutes later.

### Axis Powers Attempt to Encircle Britain in a Pincer Movement; German Influence Gradually Extends Towards the Black Sea; Soviet Interests Are at Stake and Cannot Be Ignored

Berlin. It was announced here today that large squadrons of German troops have entered Romania. According to semi-official opinions here, because German mechanized units and large numbers of infantry are moving in southeastern Europe, and Italian troops are relying on Egypt to advance towards the Suez Canal, it seems that large-scale military operations in the Mediterranean region are imminent. Military observers here predict that the cooperation of German and Italian troops on various fronts is intended to launch a huge pincer offensive to squeeze the British, squeezing them out of Gibraltar, starting from the Mediterranean Sea and the Dardanelles Strait. It is alleged that Germany is actually gradually controlling the Romanian army to prevent "any accidents" in the Black Sea region. (International News Agency telegram from the 8th)

New York. According to wireless reports, responsible parties in Berlin admitted that German troops are currently en route to Romania, and said that the dispatch of German troops is in accordance with the guarantee terms given by Germany to Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu. (Reuters telegram from the 8th)

Bucharest. More German troops entered Romania by plane yesterday. So far, there are about 15,000 German troops in Romania. According to unconfirmed reports last night, two more German divisions, about 30,000 men, will be dispatched to this place within this week. It is reported that the Romanian government has allowed German troops to enter the country to protect the oil-producing areas and reorganize the Romanian army. (Associated Press telegram from the 8th)

London. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that although rumors of German troops entering Romania have not been confirmed by the relevant parties, London believes that they are not unfounded. Well-informed sources believe that this move by the German side is a very serious development in the overall situation in the Balkan Peninsula. All countries in the Balkan Peninsula and countries with some relationship to the region are significantly affected. The German side's claim that it needs to send two or three divisions of troops to protect the oil fields to prevent sabotage is too naive to deceive people. The entry of German troops into Romania is actually the starting point for the German side to occupy Romania and tighten control over the lower reaches of the Danube River. From this, it can be seen that the German side does not have much confidence in the Iron Guard's ability to control the overall situation. It is also noteworthy that this move by the German side is the first consequence of the Brenner Pass Conference. What is most concerning in the current situation is the reaction of the Soviet Union. Moscow may not take any obvious action or criticism to express its emotions. However, nothing is more contrary to the wishes of the Soviet Union than seeing Germany establish a foothold in the Black Sea. The natural consequence of the German side's occupation of Romania will have a significant impact on the countries of the Near East, or will eventually cause the urgent problem of the Dardanelles Strait. Bulgaria is now in danger of being immediately subjected to pressure from the German side, which is also not welcome by the Soviet Union. Since the German side has taken action, it is not surprising that the Italian side will follow suit and take parallel actions. If so, it would prove the saying that the Brenner Conference agreed on a plan to deal with the Balkan Peninsula. (Reuters telegram from the 8th)

Britain Pays Attention to Developments in Romania

London. The British Foreign Office took a firm stance today on the dispute with Romania caused by the arrest of five Britons. Diplomatic circles are closely watching the development of the situation in Romania. Well-informed sources believe that the entry of German troops into Romania is a new offensive launched by the Axis powers against Turkey, whose ultimate goal is to obtain the rich oil fields of Iraq and Iran. It is said that all sectors of the Soviet Union are quite disturbed by the recent changes in the situation. (International News Agency telegram from the 8th)

Vinogradov had not met with any other foreign diplomats in Turkey since his arrival. Political figures here say that the lengthy meeting between Vinogradov and von Papen demonstrates the friendly attitude between Germany and the Soviet Union and proves that the claim that the former Soviet Ambassador to Turkey, Terentyev, was recalled because he was too close to the German Ambassador, is completely unfounded.

### America Invents a Powerful Weapon for Air Combat – New Type of Dive Bomber – Unparalleled Speed and Dense Armament – Maximum Range of 1,800 Miles

New York – The Republic Aircraft Factory on Long Island, USA, is currently manufacturing a new type of dive bomber. When diving towards the ground at a speed of 370 miles per hour, it can drop three-quarters of a ton of high-explosive bombs. According to factory officials, the aircraft's speed and dense armament are unparalleled, and it can rotate in all directions for combat on both sides. The aircraft carries three-quarters of a ton of bombs, including one 750-pound bomb and six 100-pound small bombs. The aircraft is equipped with a special bomb-dropping mechanism that prevents the bombs from touching the propeller. The nose is equipped with two 30mm rapid-fire machine guns, whose bullets can pass through the gaps in the propeller. The tail is equipped with one 30mm flexible machine gun. The aircraft's armament potential is not limited to this; two rapid-fire machine guns can also be installed inside the wings, and there is room on the wings to install 30mm machine guns for strafing enemy troops during dives. After dropping all the bombs, the aircraft can intercept enemy fighter planes. The aircraft is made entirely of metal and is equipped with a 1,000-horsepower or more duplex Wasp engine. Its maximum range is 1,800 miles. It can be said to be a long range for a single-engine aircraft. After the bombs are dropped, its rate of climb reaches 3,000 feet per minute, and its maximum altitude is 30,000 feet. (International News Agency Telegraph, 8th)

### Germany and Italy Lure Bulgaria to Join the Axis Front – Macedonian Nationalists Call for Independence – Greece Opposes the Dismemberment of Territory

Budapest – Diplomatic circles in Sofia are circulating rumors that Bulgaria will join the German-Italian-Japanese alliance. The news of German troops entering Romania was followed shortly by Bulgaria's entry into the Axis powers. This move indicates that Greece will be divided sooner, or that Yugoslavia may lose its territory. It is expected that Italy will invite representatives from the governments of Greece, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia to Rome to peacefully resolve the territorial demands of Bulgaria and Albania. Bulgaria is demanding an outlet through Thrace to the Aegean Sea, while Albania is demanding the northwestern part of Greece. At the same time, Macedonian nationalists are calling for independence or demanding that the Macedonian people merge with Bulgaria. If this happens, a small part of Yugoslavia will be annexed. It is rumored that Greece is still firmly opposed to any territorial concessions. Albania has concentrated 150,000 troops on its border. It is generally expected that Greece will succumb to the military force of the Axis powers and the pressure from Bulgaria. (International Telegraph, 8th)

Casual War Talks (2)(10)

### A Brief History of the Construction of the German Air Force

Although the German Air Force does not have a long history, its organization, changes, progress, and the main figures in charge of its construction are all worthy of attention. The following is a translation of the records from the New York Times and Time magazine: 1. The importance of the German Air Force in this war cannot be overestimated, but it has clearly leapt from an auxiliary position to become the main weapon for today's independent attack on Britain. Five years ago, Hitler tasked Goering with building the Air Force. Goering was originally an aviation veteran in the last European war, serving as the commander of the famous "Richthofen" squadron. He nurtured and promoted it with the greatest effort, and finally created today's unparalleled air combat weapon. The initial and only goal of the German Air Force was to attack the enemy, to destroy all transportation, supplies, and production centers in the enemy's rear in one fell swoop, so that when the army advanced, it could achieve the effect of a sweeping wind.

The German Air Force no longer needs to cooperate with the army and can complete its independent tasks. Today's large-scale German attack on Britain is a demonstration of this style. There is not a single German soldier on British soil, but the German Air Force is disregarding everything and launching a decisive attack. Whether it is possible to determine the military victory or defeat of the two countries by relying solely on the Air Force is still unknown. However, according to the opinions of German military observers, the continuous bombing of Britain can shake the enemy's resistance before the army lands.

In order to create its independent combat position, the German Air Force adopted a self-sufficient method in its organization. All the necessary equipment for air force operations should be available. The German Air Force has its own communications team, its own medical equipment, and even "Air Force infantry," who use parachutes to carry out combat in the enemy's rear, holding strongholds until the main force arrives. These are all unique features of the German Air Force.

The German Air Force's achievement of its current position should be attributed to Goering and others. The brewing began ten years ago, but the actual training of personnel or the manufacture of machinery began in 1935. Therefore, the history of the construction of the German Air Force is only five years. The person in charge was Goering, and his confidant Milch. Goering was the designer, Hitler was the supporter, and Milch was the implementer and organizer, so his contribution was also great.

Goering and Milch met at the beginning of the Nazi Party's organization. Goering served in Baron Richthofen's famous air squadron in the last war. Milch was initially an artillery officer and later became the president of the state-owned airline. He is short in stature and full of energy. Judging from his appearance, he has the air of a shrewd and capable American businessman. In the early days of its creation, it was difficult and painstaking. Germany was originally a poor country, and was bound by the Treaty of Versailles at the time, and could not establish an air force. In 1933, the Nazi Party came to power, and Aviation Minister Goering appointed Milch as the Director of Air Transportation. Milch ordered the brave general Udet to leave the film industry and join the Ministry of Aviation to establish a model for the Air Force. Afterwards, he began to train 100,000 young aviation personnel and 1,100 personnel for air raid defense. Some colleagues also opposed it. His way of doing things has a bit of a businessman's "seeking quick profits" style, and lacks the special style of a German soldier. His character is not as strict and resolute as a military man, but has a bit of gentleness. Milch also has two colleagues who are also outstanding talents, one is Kesselring, and the other is Sperrle. They and Goering and Milch are all generals. Kesselring was an artillery officer in the last war, the same as Milch. In 1935, he changed to the Ministry of Aviation. He participated in the invasion of Poland and commanded the first air force operation. He is tall and lively, originally from Bavaria, and can be said to be one of the most important senior generals in the German Air Force.

Sperrle is completely of Prussian military color - solid, serious, simple and decisive. In the last war, he was shot down in a plane and seriously injured. During the Spanish Civil War, he led the Air Force to assist Franco in combat, and hundreds of elite German pilots practiced tactics under his guidance. In addition, there is also a central figure in the German Air Force, General Geibona, who succeeded General Wever as the Chief of Staff of the German Air Force in 1937.

Outsiders do not know the actual strength of the German Air Force at present. According to pre-war estimates, at the end of 1939, the German Air Force had 8,000 to 10,000 aircraft in the first line. In the past four years, the German aircraft production volume has increased rapidly. Since the start of the war, it has not been reduced. Therefore, the above number should not be insufficient, and may even be exceeded.

Nanyang had no way to enter. Liangxi's game against Paramount, for the first thirty minutes, was unexpectedly tense and exciting. Liangxi took the lead with 6 points first. Later, Paramount could only lead by one or two points. Until the last ten minutes, the entire Liangxi army disintegrated. Liangxi's offense and defense were excellent last night, and the ball was not wasted, so that Paramount could not use its skills. It is a pity that the basketball skills are too poor, and it is impossible to win.

Unprecedented High Price for Auctioning the Game Ball

Last night, because there were two good games, the audience was only slightly less than the game between Shanghai Star and Paramount. The order was very good. During the half-time break, Yuan Ludeng, the chairman of the Nanjing Academy, auctioned the game ball. It was first opened at 100 yuan, and after increasing to 600 yuan, Mr. Zhou Junxian suddenly opened an amazing high price of 1,000 yuan. Mr. Li Hengzhai did not want to be outdone in doing good deeds, and finally purchased it at an unprecedented high price of 1,100 yuan. His benevolence and righteousness are admirable.

Nanyang Loses to Xiqing Giants

Nanyang vs. Giants took the stage first. Nanyang recently won the United Cup A2 Group Championship, and its momentum is strong. The Giants are tall and strong. At the beginning of the game, Han Longhai scored first, and the Giant Sha Sijin returned the favor. Xie Luoyun threw a belt penalty, and reversed to lead 4-2. Since then, the Giants have been going smoothly, and instantly led 10-2. Seeing the situation was not good, Nanyang cooperated to counterattack. The first half ended, and Nanyang was 4-12 behind. After changing baskets, Nanyang quickly caught up. Han Longhai was extremely active and scored points one after another. They once chased to 16-18, only two points behind. However, the Giant Sha Sijin threw one and penalized one, adding three points again. When Han Longhai threw it in, the statutory time had arrived, and Nanyang finally lost miserably by a difference of three points with 18-21. This game was presented with two pennants by the Youyou Sports Association. The Giants and Nanyang each won one. The scores of both sides are as follows:

Paramount Wins Against Liangxi Again

The Paramount vs. Liangxi game continued. Paramount took the field with Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xianglong, Feng Nianhua, Zhang Shaoqing, and Lu Zhongen. Liangxi took the field with Wang Nanqun, Liang Yunming, Zou Ziren, Zhang Shikui, and Zhuo Guorong. Referee Liu Hesheng blew a silver whistle and started the battle. Liangxi rose sharply. After Li Zhenzhong opened the scoring, Zhuo Liang and Wang each scored a goal, and instantly took the lead 6-2. Paramount chased hard, and Feng Li and Zhang had to shoot and hit, creating an 8-8 tie. Later, it became a difficult 10-10 and 12-12 situation. At this time, Liangxi Wang Nanqun unfortunately injured his foot and left the field. Gao Baosheng replaced him, and the situation plummeted. Paramount Chen Xianglong took a shot and chased out with 14-12. When Wang Nanqun re-entered the field, the first half ended, and Liangxi was at a disadvantage with 10-17. It has been said that it is the world of Paramount, and Liangxi has never recovered from this. The generals of Paramount are like entering a no-man's land, and suddenly lead with 25-15. Since then, there have been changes in the line of both sides, but Liangxi has not improved. Only in the end, Zhang Liangxiong scored three points. In conclusion, Paramount lost to Liangxi with 33-18, and has formed a situation of four consecutive victories. The scores are as follows:

Initially, speculators and Chinese banks sold heavily, causing the current British pound to stiffen to 3 shillings 7.75 pence. Citibank's current US dollar reached 5.8125 yuan, during which futures were allowed to loosen. The market atmosphere began to turn in the afternoon because there were favorable rumors in the market, and the Hong Kong telegram arrived, indicating foreign banks were taking advantage of the low prices to frequently absorb. Therefore, by the evening, the closing price had returned to 3 shillings 6.875 pence and 5.71875 yuan, resulting in a slight loosening of 0.03125 compared to the previous day's British pound. The US dollar, however, showed no clear gain or loss.

HSBC then took advantage of the low prices to absorb slightly, and it became stable. Sassoon and Co. absorbed the US dollar for October delivery at 5.8125 yuan. Although it weakened again, foreign banks were happy to absorb at low prices, so the market momentum was slightly flat. At noon, HSBC issued the British pound for November delivery to its peers at 3 shillings 7.5 pence. The closing price was 3 shillings 7.1875 pence for the British pound and 5.75 yuan for the US dollar.

The Market Was Eager to Buy in the Afternoon

In the afternoon, the market turned tight due to favorable rumors. The Hong Kong telegram suddenly arrived, and foreign banks offered 5.71875 yuan for the US dollar spot. Later, they were eager to eat and digest, absorbing speculators' US dollar for October delivery at 5.71875 yuan. At that time, the current US dollar would soften to 5.6875 yuan.

### New Multi-Activity: Gold Prices Wanted to Fall but Stopped

Yesterday, the spot gold market was weak in the morning but recovered with the tightening of the exchange market, and the market atmosphere became firm and stable. As a result, it slightly rose. Initially, due to the weak atmosphere of the previous day and the lengthening of the exchange market, both openly and secretly, the selling atmosphere was quite strong for a time. The Qian-Dui industry and banking groups competed to sell short. At one point, a new recent low of 5,575 yuan was created. Fortunately, the foreign exchange rate tightened, and new multi-buyers became active. Seeing the situation, securities companies and banks covered their shorts. Rumors spread that the US Atlantic garrison was withdrawing to its original defense positions. Therefore, by the evening, it rose to 5,725 yuan. The closing price also had 5,715 yuan, which was 10 yuan higher than the previous day. More than 4,000 taels were traded throughout the day. The price of jewelry gold at the gold shops ultimately remained flat. The customs gold price remained fixed.

The Spot Gold Rose by 10 Yuan

The exchange market loosened in the early morning, and the market momentum was weak. The opening price was 55 yuan lower. The silver firm offered 10 taels of gold,逊逊(unreadable) was 5,650 yuan. As securities companies and banks sold heavily, and the foreign exchange rate loosened for a time, buyers were reluctant. It fell into the 5,600 yuan mark, retreating to 5,590 yuan. Later, the exchange market stabilized slightly, and buyers began to become active. The supply was felt to be greater than demand for the amount. The securities companies covered their shorts and the bank's new multi-purchases accounted for more, and it suddenly rose to 5,660 yuan. However, because the exchange market loosened again, gold shops and Qian-Dui industries competed to sell. At this time, another silver firm suddenly came to sell short a lot, and it was re-suppressed to the low price of 5,570 yuan. After 11:00, the foreign exchange rate stopped loosening and recovered slightly, and the market momentum reappeared hardening. The bank bulls increased their bets, and the securities companies came to cover their shorts. Before the close, it rose again to 5,660 yuan. However, the noon closing price fell slightly, to 5,645 yuan. The market opened in the afternoon, and there were very few sellers, so it was raised to 5,670 yuan. Although Qian-Dui industries and securities companies released, it fell to 5,645 yuan. But not long after, the exchange market reported a tight market, and the buying trend rose sharply. Banks and gangs absorbed it, and it rose to 5,710 yuan. After this, the buying wind stopped for a time, and it fell to 5,680 yuan. However, the exchange market continued to weaken, and securities companies and banks furiously covered their shorts. A few even turned from short to long. The multiple parties took the opportunity to pick up prices, and then rose to 5,725 yuan. Before the close, the floating multiples were slightly settled, and they fell back 30 yuan. However, people's hearts seemed to have turned better, and there were many buyers at low prices, so the evening closing price rose to 5,715 yuan. As a result, it rose by 10 yuan compared to the previous day. The whole day rose and fell by 150 yuan. The cash number's own brand gold selling price was more than ten yuan higher than the spot gold price. The purchase was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is little trading.

Jewelry Gold Fell and Then Returned

The gold jewelry at the silver shops, for each tael sold, hung small ten yuan at 10:30, and returned to ten yuan at 3:30 in the afternoon. As a result, the major peers still suspended 590 yuan, and the new peers were similar to the previous price. The purchase was reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Fell and Then Returned

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: The spot gold fell and then rose. The British and American gold pounds also fell first and then returned flat. The British gold ticket fell by five jiao because the black market British pound and US dollar were long. The US gold ticket initially retreated to 16.85 yuan. Later, because of widespread reports that the international situation had improved, people's hearts revived, and it was raised to 17.30 yuan in the afternoon, but it was still five fen lower than the previous day. The Hong Kong ticket fell sharply as the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate fell, and the supply from all parties was quite strong. The Japanese gold ticket supply and demand were uniform, and the market price stood flat. The evening market still stood at the original price of 1.45 yuan. The Korean ticket slightly weakened, and the evening market was 1.15 yuan.

### Grains: Imported Rice Rose and Fell Frequently, New Japonica Rice Arrival Not Weak

The rice market turned into a hovering situation. Yesterday, the initial opening was due to the tired momentum of the previous afternoon, and people's hearts were still weak. Floating households continued to come out, and the sales field was called lonely. In addition, the goods on the way arrived in Shanghai one after another, and large ticket orders could arrive in port in the near future. Moreover, the exchange rate loosened again, and continued planning. The market was weak with people's hearts, and the price of the new Japonica rice that arrived continued to fall by one yuan to one yuan and thirty-five jiao. At the lowest time, No. 2 Saigon opened at only 65 yuan, No. 2 Luojia at 63 yuan, and small fine grain at 62.5 yuan. However, after this drop, there was quite a low-price activity. Not only the shorts, but also the general actual sales, did more procurement. Suddenly, the buying atmosphere turned strong, and the market color returned tighter. As a result, it was only slightly depreciated. The price of No. 1 Saigon was 71.5 yuan, No. 2 Saigon was 66 yuan, then 65.5 yuan, No. 2 Luojia was 64.5 yuan, 64 yuan, small fine grain was 63.5 yuan, 63 yuan, rice chaff was 54.8 yuan, 64 yuan, and Wuhu pointed grain was 62 yuan. However, because the exchange rate shrank in the afternoon, the goods were unwilling to lightly trade, and there was a Shantou gang who inquired, so the original package of No. 2 Saigon, which had once opened at 77.5 yuan in the morning, was then raised to 78 yuan, and after the year to 78.5 yuan. The current rice also followed by five or six jiao, and as a result, it was still seven or eight jiao smaller than the previous market. No. 1 Saigon opened at 71.5 yuan, 71 yuan, middle at 69.5 yuan, No. 2 at 65.8 yuan to 64.5 yuan, Luojia No. 2 at 63.5 yuan to 62.7 yuan, fire fine grain at 71.5 yuan to 70 yuan, and small fine grain at 63 yuan to 62.5 yuan. A total of 5,000 bags of current rice and 200 tons of original bags were opened and traded throughout the day.

Imported Rice Has Arrived in Shanghai Again: The Taikoo Company's Anhui ship arrived at the port the night before last (7th) at about 7:00, loaded with 2,764 bags from Hong Kong, and was berthed at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession to unload.

The supply and demand of both domestic and foreign glutinous rice were similar, and there was no gain or loss. Although the thick and thin broken japonica rice has been exhausted, the market is also scarce, but because the price is extremely expensive, it is not easy to sell. Moreover, it is 相相(unreadable) by other goods, resulting in a drop of one yuan. The early rice of Nanhang opened at 87 yuan, then 85 yuan.

The arrival of new japonica pointed rice and cellar seed rice continued to have two or three thousand shih, but the Middle Yang pointed rice suddenly heard of being out of stock, so the Yang pointed rice had no market. The arrival of Du pointed rice was limited and flat, selling for 70 yuan, then 65.5 yuan. The new japonica rice and cellar seed rice were tired because the arrival and sales were uneven, with a drop of one yuan. The Minhang new japonica rice opened at 79 yuan to 77 yuan, and the Xitang cellar seed opened at 78 yuan, 77.5 yuan. The Jiaolixiang japonica rice was also on the market yesterday, opening at 82 yuan.

### Large Quantities of Imported Flour Will Arrive

Flour: Yesterday's market turned from firm to flat. It was found that the amount of imported wheat set by the factory was limited, so production was insufficient, and the quantity allocated was still scarce, which was not enough to meet the needs of this street. Therefore, the situation of rolling spot was already formed. Yesterday, the wholesale price of this street was still 16.5 yuan for the original market, while the customer market needed 18.5 yuan. The customers slightly added to the procurement, but the amount was also small. As for the transaction of recycled old car flour, because a large number of imported flour was about to arrive, people's hearts gradually became quieter, so the buying and selling became quiet again. The imported flour also loosened by two or three jiao, and the price was 18.45 yuan.

Wheat: Yesterday, the price of wheat was clearly fixed and secretly discounted, because road transportation was difficult, and the arrival of cars and ships was scattered. The Japanese factory still limited the purchase price to 21 yuan, and the Chinese factory was also reluctant to release prices to absorb because the goods were scarce. As for the concession, because there were inland gangs and hoarders procuring, the asking price once reached 27 yuan, but there was no agreement. The situation is still brewing.

### Yarn and Cotton: Speculation Unanimously Leaned Towards Buying, Yarn Prices Not Easy to Fall

The yarn market entered a roundabout route again, but people's hearts were still considered good, because the Hong Kong gang's demand for 10-count coarse yarn was still not weakening. At the same time, speculation had a unanimous tendency to purchase, so although the exchange rate was lengthening step by step, the buyer's morale did not show a decline. According to the current situation, most of them are doing more and seeing higher. Therefore, the market is not easy to relax. Checking the situation on the market, it is said that some people are doing it, only seeing the big, not the small. Today, 595 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

The spot yarn opened in the morning, and the popularity in the market did not show weakness. The general opinion was that the decline still tended to drag in, so although the asking price was small, there were still very few sellers. The first market price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,170 yuan. Suddenly, it was heard that it rose to 1,185 yuan. Then, it was heard that the US dollar was lengthening greatly, and the gold companies and grab-hat companies released one after another, and the market disk returned to fall, falling to 1,155 yuan. However, those who profited from the low price covered, and more parties were active again, and the market disk gradually rebounded to 1,167 yuan. After closing, it rose by another ten yuan. According to the statistics of transactions in half a day, 5,355 bales were traded, and the market price fell by ten yuan. The amount of purchases by each gang is listed as follows: 同同行(Unreadable) 4,400 Hong Kong 955 Statistics 5,355

### Fellow Traders Were Hoarding, Cotton Had a Market but No Sales

The spot cotton transaction was like a standstill. This was because the exchange rate was lengthening day by day, but the yarn market rose and fell from time to time, resulting in uneven morale. However, recently, the amount of yarn prices that have risen is not small. The proportion of flower prices is fresher than yarn, so the holders are extremely unwilling to let go, and then there is a market but no sales.

康笛許(Unreadable) 219.00 永記德(Unreadable) 10 pieces

Another message: The foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, was uneven. Because all parties were waiting for the government to announce the field report tomorrow, there was a slight southern 套賣(Unreadable) yesterday. As a result, the closing price was one or two pounds lower than the previous day's tone. The India-linked price rose by one rupee.

The Shanghai foreign cotton transaction was slightly quiet yesterday. In fact, the market has insufficient inventory, fellow traders have a high mindset, and they are all unwilling to sell samples. The factory's purchasing intentions were quite strong, but it was difficult to buy. The loosening of the exchange rate did not affect the cotton market and instead saw a high price.

### Securities: C Stocks Drawn to More Than Ten Percent, Returned to Original Price in Two Hours

Six-Li-Li British Gold Bonds Drawn by Lot, Foreign Stocks Fell First and Then Rose

Yesterday's securities dark market, the market situation was flat and slightly tired in the morning, but Dingzhong was only small, and the price was the same as the even drawn lottery price in the morning, which shows that the demand was suddenly hot after the lottery was drawn. In the afternoon, the buying atmosphere of No. 41 was extremely strong, and it was impossible to suppress the market. Yesterday morning, the selling atmosphere was more surging, and No. 24 sold more than 200,000. Lianyi also sold off, but Xinchang Jufeng bought in, and the market price was 之殃象(Unreadable). At that time, the selling atmosphere of No. 41 was extremely strong, and Renchang also sold a lot, but the buyers felt even more enthusiastic. Tongsheng Tongkang Runde Shunchang Lianyi Hongda absorbed one after another. The C stocks still穿(Unreadable) out eight yuan. After an interval of two hours, the drawing corner, the B stocks rose by two jiao. The transaction was about 2 million yuan. A brief summary is listed below.

A total of 100 50-pound bonds, 200 100-pound bonds, and 49 1,000-pound bonds were drawn, with a total principal of 54,000 British gold pounds to be repaid.

In the stock transaction, 100 shares of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 16.3 yuan.

Yesterday, the opening of the public stock market was still soft, and the price was slightly lower than the previous close. Soon, the bulls settled again like a tide, and the prices of the stocks fell again. The decline of Jardine Matheson was particularly fierce, and the lowest price was 66 yuan. Until the midday, because the news was better and the exchange market tended to tighten, the price began to turn around. After a very short-lived profit settlement in the afternoon, the market situation improved even more. At the close, the stocks all had good buyers. Jardine Matheson retreated sharply and rose rapidly, returning to 74.5 yuan at the close. Other famous stocks also had a considerable rebound. The rubber stocks were particularly good, and the stocks of various Dutch companies were traded in large quantities.

London, 7th (Monday) Telegram: Today, the listed market prices of Chinese foreign debts and Far East business companies' stocks are still flat and sluggish. Only the HSBC Bank shares show a rise, with the British registration rising by one pound, priced at 67 pounds, and the Hong Kong registration rising by three pounds, priced at 74 pounds. The rest remain unchanged.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Market Momentum Shakes

Recently, the soybean market situation has been driven by the oil price, and the exit is not lonely, so the market atmosphere is quite handsome. However, in the past two days, the sales market on this street has been replenished by the source of the near countryside, and there has been a slight return in the market. The oil price has also挫小(Unreadable), and the wall has been shaken. According to statistics, 400 bags of Qingdao beans were opened, priced at 36.6 yuan, 200 bags of new beans, priced at 41 yuan, and more than 50 bags of Dachang beans, priced at 34 yuan to 35.3 yuan.

### Piece Goods: Cloth is Being Purchased Again

Yesterday's cloth market, with the vigorous absorption of the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs, the morale was revitalized, and the hoarders also stopped selling and buying. The morning market of the cloth was flat, and in the afternoon, the price rose by 2.5 jiao per piece. More than 500 pieces of grey cloth, bleached and dyed cloth 絨(Unreadable)and coarse cloth were traded in this street.

Eastern Cloth: Fell first and then rose, the market momentum turned firm. The 12-pound Longtou fine cloth closed in the morning at a price of 35.9 yuan per piece.

It was heard that 78 points of white factory had sold at a new low price of 5,050 yuan, a huge drop of 200 yuan from last week. The situation between Japan and the United States is dangerous, the price of gold is falling, and Sino-US transportation may become a problem, so there is this decline.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Step Down

Yesterday's sugar market had a more suitable price due to the lengthening of the foreign exchange rate. The association's drawing plate was loosening even more. The spot price of 24 coarse white 本棧(Unreadable) was 77.9 half, small five jiao, 外棧(Unreadable) 76.5 yuan, a drop of one yuan, the transit goods were called 60.5 yuan, also small one yuan, and there was still a lack of transactions.

The trend is still soft, and the subsequent loosening is still prevented.

### North and South Goods: Preserved Red Dates from Fuzhou Turn Downward

Since the new crop of preserved red dates from Fuzhou has arrived, and due to relatively large shipments, prices have turned soft. Yesterday's opening price for higher-quality goods was 40 yuan, with subsequent reductions.

### US State Department Issues Instructions: Advising Overseas Chinese in the Far East to Evacuate; US Policy Towards the Far East Becomes Increasingly Firm; American Nationals in Shanghai Await Official Notification

According to reliable sources from Western circles yesterday, the State Department in Washington has instructed all US consulates in the Far East to urge American nationals residing in China (including the Northeast), Hong Kong, and Vietnam to return to their country as soon as possible. It is understood that American nationals, especially women and children, have been ordered to evacuate quickly. Chinese circles in Shanghai believe that this development may be a prelude to the US entering the European war. Chinese sources further stated that this development should not be taken lightly, as Socony-Vacuum and Texaco issued suggestions just three days ago, advising families of American staff to return to the US as soon as possible. It was also said at the time that staff of Chase Bank and Citibank had also received similar advice.

Official Circular Soon to Arrive in Shanghai

It is understood that, regarding travel and residence of US citizens, the State Department has equated the Far East with Europe, and that this action is a precautionary step, not based on any particular development in the Far East, but arising from general instability. Currently, the difficulty faced by families of Socony-Vacuum and Texaco staff is the issue of transpacific travel. It is anticipated that American merchant ships may be diverted to Chinese waters to assist the evacuation of American nationals. A formal advisory circular is expected to reach American nationals in China within the next few days. It is generally believed that families of officers in the Asiatic Fleet currently residing in China will also be affected by this new action. American sources say that the actions of American commercial firms in Shanghai will follow the lead of Socony-Vacuum and Texaco.

The United States Has Given a De Facto Response

The English-language "China Press" carried a commentary yesterday by the well-known commentator Woodhead, stating that the US has maintained a neutral policy towards the current European war, and although it has provided material assistance to the Allied countries as much as possible, it has not yet sent a single soldier to Europe to fight. However, whether the US will continue to maintain its neutrality in the future will depend on the decisions made by Germany, Italy, or Japan.

The United States Will Not Adopt Criminal Policies

Japanese Prime Minister Konoe, in a recent statement to journalists, openly threatened the US, stating that if the US does not recognize the demands of the Axis powers (including Japan) and actively cooperate with Japan in building a "New Order in East Asia," Japan will "not hesitate to fight." From the US point of view, such a request is tantamount to inviting the US to be an accomplice in a grave international crime. In fact, regardless of which party is in power in the US, it will never adopt a policy of cooperating with Japan to commit such a crime.

The Whole Country Unanimously Supports China

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, US policy towards the Far East has been extremely firm, and today, US policy is even firmer than before. The Roosevelt administration has openly supported a free China, and even Roosevelt's political rival (Willkie) has publicly advocated doing everything possible to help the Chongqing government. Konoe's threat has had the impact on US public opinion that we had anticipated.

Konoe's Threat Provokes a Strong Reaction

The US has now made it clear that the US government will not allow Konoe or any other Japanese official to undermine the newly implemented policy. The first response of the US to Konoe's threat was the call-up of 27,000 naval reservists. When announcing this decision, the Secretary of the Navy warned his country that the "time of testing" for the Axis powers was near. The Japanese government should be aware of the current position of the US.

Most of Humanity Awaits Salvation

Dictators in Europe and militarist warlords in the Far East "are determined to build their 'New Order.'" All freedom-loving people oppose this "New Order." Under this "New Order," countless people are sacrificed. The realization of the "New Order" is tantamount to imposing despair and misery on most of humanity. Looking at the people of Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Abyssinia, and the occupied territories of France and China, can it be said that there is any joy in life under the "New Order"? These people endure humiliation and live only in the hope of salvation by those who uphold justice, and the restoration of their lost freedom.

### US Embassy Secretary and Others Return to the US for Vacation in Succession

The President Cleveland, a mail steamer of the US President Lines, set sail from Shanghai on the afternoon of the previous day. It is understood that Mr. and Mrs. Grindle, Secretary of the US Embassy in Beijing, and Mr. Feder, US Consul in Chongqing and Xiamen, all boarded the ship to return to the US for vacation in succession. They will return to China upon the expiration of their leave.

### British Admiral Knoble Passes Through Shanghai and Embarks on a Voyage Back to His Country, With a Stopover in Canada

According to official sources yesterday, Admiral Knoble, the former commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, relinquished his post in Hong Kong and handed over his duties to Admiral Leighton. He arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 7th aboard the Empress of Russia. It is understood that Knoble boarded the same ship the night before last and sailed to the United Kingdom via Canada. It is currently unknown whether he will be assigned to a new position after arriving in the UK. Chinese newspapers reported yesterday that Knoble held a meeting with Admiral Hart of the US Asiatic Fleet during his brief stay in Shanghai, but British authorities here claim they are unaware of any such meeting. However, they continued to say that Knoble may have paid a private friendly visit to Admiral Hart.

### Tomorrow, the Whole City Will Enthusiastically Celebrate National Day by Displaying Flags; Various Organizations Send Telegrams to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to Express Respect; Unanimously Promoting the National Day Donation and Construction Movement

Tomorrow is the Double Tenth National Day Anniversary. All sectors of the city, in addition to celebrating by displaying flags in accordance with the eight-day flag display method agreed upon by various public organizations and the concession authorities, all agencies, public organizations, schools, as well as the banking and money industries, and various market places will be closed as usual. All sectors, in order to support national policy and enhance the foundation of the country, will unanimously promote National Day donations, collect winter clothing donations, national construction savings, and frugality and disaster relief movements. The National Day Winter Clothing Donation Movement Week, advocated by the city's Fundraising and慰勞 (comforting/supporting) 代金 (substitute money) Committee, is also scheduled to begin tomorrow. All companies, shops, and factories will hold charity sales for a week. Individuals will contribute one day's income as winter clothing substitute money, striving to achieve the target of raising one million yuan for winter clothing substitute money, to be presented with doubled respect. The two concession authorities, in order to prevent unscrupulous elements from engaging in activities during the National Day Anniversary, have implemented joint security measures since yesterday. All non-essential roads and lanes have been scheduled to be blocked off from midnight today to cut off traffic. The police in both concessions will dispatch additional detectives and patrol teams tomorrow morning to patrol the roads to ensure strict prevention.

Telegrams to Chairman Chiang to Offer Comfort and Respect

The Shanghai Lide Fellowship Association, the Wuxi Shanghai Alumni Association, the Wujin Shanghai Alumni Association, the Dechong Sports Association, the Riri Service Society, the Mutual Aid Fellowship Association of Primary and Secondary School Teachers, the Qingpu Shanghai Alumni Association, the National Products Sales Society, the United Association of Factory Partners, the Women's Triple Education Association, the Taixing Shanghai Alumni Association, the Ning Shao Shanghai Alumni Association, the Electrical Workers Fellowship Association, and other groups, in light of tomorrow being the National Day holiday, and in view of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's supervision of the war of resistance, with frequent news of victories, hard work and great achievements, and the prospect of victory in sight, have sent telegrams to Chongqing to express their highest respect.

Various Sectors Stipulate Methods for Frugality and Construction

The Lide Fellowship Association yesterday announced to all sectors and its members that on National Day, each will donate one day's income, and stipulated that from October 10th to October 16th, it will be a Frugality and Construction Savings Movement Week, instructing each member to promote it separately. In order to adapt to the Shanghai environment, the following methods have been specifically formulated: (1) Each member should unite ten non-member relatives and friends to form a Frugality and National Construction Savings Group; (2) The savings of each group can open a public account name and be deposited into a bank monthly; (3) Each country should appoint one director to be responsible for collecting savings and keeping the deposit book; (4) Each member should determine the amount of silver they are willing to save each month according to their ability, and should not reduce or stop it midway; (5) This savings is to be deposited into the bank using a zero-deposit, lump-sum withdrawal method, with a fixed period of at least two years; (6) After the term expires, each group will decide on a method of use under the major goal of national construction work that is beneficial. The association also believes that this method is an excellent opportunity for citizens in the concessions to express their patriotic enthusiasm automatically in an extraordinary environment, so it requests all sectors to strive to imitate and promote it, and deeply hopes that every citizen will not be confused by the smog and haze, and not be intoxicated by the bright lights and fine wines, but should quickly strictly adhere to their posts, practice frugality, and preserve vitality for their children and grandchildren, and not be sinners of the nation.

Foreign Ships in the Huangpu River Display Flags to Celebrate Together

The US flagship Augusta and a small ship, as well as two British and French shallow-water gunboats, are docked in the Huangpu River. On this day, except for Japanese ships, all foreign ships and customs ships will uniformly display flags to celebrate China's National Day. At that time, colorful flags will fly on each ship, fluttering in the wind, greatly enhancing the color of the Huangpu River, which is enough to symbolize the revival of China.

Japanese Troops in the Suburbs of Shanghai Increase Patrols

Although the people in the western suburbs of this port are in a bad environment, they deeply expect resistance and national construction. Therefore, the mood on this day is also very excited. However, the Japanese garrison in the suburbs has recently felt uneasy due to the active guerrilla teams in the suburbs, and has doubled the number of posts on the important streets and dispatched teams to patrol back and forth to inspect pedestrians.

### The Singapore Naval Base Is Immensely Powerful; Foreign Reporters Visit the Facilities; A Mass of Cranes and Hoists Are Amazing

A certain American reporter, who recently visited the British military base in Singapore and then transferred to Shanghai, said that they had obtained permission from the British military authorities to visit the British military base in Singapore. There were more than 20 reporters from Australia and the United States. Due to military relations, the equipment there could not be fully revealed. But for those who opened their eyes, it was already greatly strengthened. It is worthy of being a world's large naval base. Among the naval bases, the size of the docks and the number of ships are unprecedented. Hundreds of Malay sailors are being trained there. Generally, the officers are looking forward to this non-seaman, who will be able to form a "Royal Malay Navy." At that time, most of the regular naval teams were ordered to go to sea, and the resident troops were practicing artillery firing, using the assumed target of the ocean as an enemy battleship to aim and sink. They then visited the air force base, and they were very interested in the new type of air defense weapons. Everyone said that the British military base in Singapore is indeed, as King George VI said, a symbol of Britain's determination to maintain peace. The so-called maintaining peace means eliminating aggression and pacifying chaos. Now that Germany, Italy, and Japan have formed a military alliance, and the United Kingdom and the United States feel threatened by the Axis powers, it is expected that the British military base in Singapore will soon be able to exert its power, with British and American fleets concentrated to guard it, so that invaders in the Far East dare not face it directly.

### American National Mayer Returns Swindled Money; American Authorities Still Investigate and Prosecute; However, Criminal Conviction Is Expected to Be Reduced

The Shanghai Times reported that Mayer, an American national living in Shanghai, recently suggested to the French national Heiman Tingge that he be commissioned with a ship, thereby swindling him out of 10,000 yuan. After Heiman sued the US Consular Court in China, an arrest warrant was issued. It was recently heard that Mayer had entrusted someone to transfer the 10,000 yuan to Heiman on Sunday in the hope of settling the case privately. However, the US authorities are still issuing an arrest warrant for Mayer, because according to American law, Mayer's return of the swindled money does not eliminate the crime he committed. Once Mayer is arrested and brought to justice, he will still be prosecuted for the fraud case. However, since the swindled money has been returned, his punishment may be reduced. If Mayer or his allies (who are not American and not subject to the jurisdiction of the Consular Court) do not appear in court to prove Mayer's fraudulent behavior, then this case may be dismissed. Also, the Great Evening News reported that the rumor that Mayer had escaped to Ningbo could not be confirmed. According to the US authorities, Mayer's arrest, or even his surrender, is only a matter of time. At present, all ports in the Far East are implementing strict regulations. Mayer wants to leave Shanghai and escape elsewhere, which is impossible. According to reports, Mayer is the younger brother of Mayer Lewis, a shareholder of the American MGM Film Company.

### Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Food Committee Issues Opinions on the Rice Market; Explains Criticisms from All Parties; Believes That Limiting Rice Brokers Does Not Help the Situation

Mr. Marshall, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Food Committee, yesterday issued his opinions on the rice market in this port. First, he said that it is rare for the various committees of the Municipal Council to make public announcements in the name of the chairman, but in view of the fact that this committee is not a normal committee of the Municipal Council, and because the Director-General and Director-General/President have repeatedly insisted, he wrote an article to express his opinions as follows.

Repeatedly Contacted and Coordinated with the Japanese Side

The first thing to be stated is that I do not want to criticize other authorities, because they have suffered special difficulties. What I want to express is limited to the policies adopted by this committee and its opinions on the rice market. The measures taken by the Municipal Council for the rice market are based on the recommendations of this committee. Recently, rice prices have soared, and the outside world believes that the Municipal Council has not taken appropriate measures and cannot stop the rise in rice prices, which has been criticized quite a lot. Furthermore, due to the recent remarks of "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an in his interview with the North China Daily News reporter, some people's minds may have an impression that the Municipal Council not only stood idly by, but also was unwilling to cooperate with the authorities in the neighboring areas. Therefore, it is necessary to solemnly explain in order to correct the record.

The Municipal Council has requested the Japanese authorities to find ways to clear up the source of domestic rice more than once, and has repeatedly expressed its willingness to cooperate fully with all relevant parties in order to ensure that domestic rice can be transported to Shanghai smoothly and without obstruction. In July of this year, "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an suggested to the Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council that the three municipal authorities send representatives to jointly review the food problem in this port. The Municipal Council agreed with the above suggestion and sent myself and the secretary of this committee, etc., on July 16th to attend a meeting in the city center to discuss how to improve the rice market and decided to organize a joint committee to study ways to improve the rice market and resolved that "Mayor" Chuan should convene a second meeting. On the 20th of the same month, the Municipal Council appointed committee member Mr. Merlo, Secretary Mr. Pisley, and myself as the Municipal Council representatives. At the same time, the French Municipal Council also appointed several representatives, but "Mayor" Chuan never convened a meeting afterwards.

Only Hope That the Rice Market Will Stop Raising Prices

The transportation of domestic rice from the producing areas to Shanghai has been subject to various restrictions and cannot be transported to Shanghai smoothly, so that the residents of the concession have to rely on the supply of foreign rice. This committee believes that if the selling price of foreign rice is restricted, it cannot exceed its cost plus a reasonable profit, which will not only be of no help, but will also be harmful. We must recognize the fact that it is better to obtain rice at a high price than to have no rice to buy, because if merchants trade without profit, they will inevitably stop purchasing. This committee hopes to stop raising prices, but believes that restricting the selling price below its cost will cause many dangers. Therefore, it is willing to invite outside criticism rather than recommending such erroneous steps to the Municipal Council.

This committee is not unaware that some people are hoarding rice and selling it at a high price, but hoarding rice is not only in danger of mildew, but also in danger of suffering significant losses due to falling rice prices, especially when the mainland relaxes its ban and domestic rice floods in. In the current turbulent world situation, the most urgent task is to store sufficient rice to prevent shipping from being blocked. Any crude regulations will only stop the ordering of foreign rice. As for the general merchants' pre-storage of goods, we really have nothing to object to, because they must rely on their inventory to supply the market continuously.

Since the Municipal Council has no way to control the source of domestic rice, nor can it order large quantities of foreign rice to transport to Shanghai to aid the market, the disposal of the rice market must be carefully planned to avoid hindering the ordering of foreign rice by merchants or individuals.

### Japanese Troops' Failed Attack on Yangcheng Lake; Have Retreated to Suzhou

At 9:00 am on September 29th, more than 100 Japanese troops, traveling in four motorboats, attacked Yangcheng Lake. At Nitan Port, southeast of Taiping Bridge, they encountered the garrison of Hu Zhaohan's troops and engaged in a fierce battle for two hours. Fourteen Japanese soldiers were killed, and many were injured. Eighteen rifles were seized. Unable to withstand the attack, they retreated to Suzhou. It is heard that the Japanese troops in Suzhou are very weak, and the garrisons in the small strongholds have been withdrawn.

### Police Authority in the Western District; Negotiations Have Not Been Resumed; Negotiations Have Stalled

According to a Shanghai Municipal Council spokesperson's statement to Western reporters yesterday, the negotiations on the issue of police authority in the areas outside the boundaries of the roads have reached a standstill. After receiving the opinion letter presented by Major Bowman, Chief Superintendent of the Police Department, the Municipal Council invited Fu Xiao'an to instruct Lu Ying to meet with representatives of the Police Department to discuss this issue, but Fu Xiao'an has not yet arranged for Lu Ying to meet with representatives of the Police Department, so that the two sides have had no opportunity to talk.

### The Wounded Soldiers of the Isolated Battalion; Life in the Camp Is As Stable As Ever

According to a Shanghai Municipal Council spokesperson's statement to reporters yesterday, Ding Guoshun, the soldier of the isolated battalion who was injured in the attack the day before yesterday (the 7th), is now in Renji Hospital, and his injuries have made satisfactory progress. The spokesperson said that after this incident, the situation in the isolated battalion camp was calm and there were no disputes. The spokesperson did not know the details of the injuries of the other injured Chinese man and woman, because they were taken away by a certain ambulance. However, according to the English-language American Great Evening News, the two Chinese civilians who were hit by stray bullets only suffered minor injuries and were discharged from the hospital after being bandaged.

### Labor Dispute at French Company Stalled Again; Two More Ticket Inspectors Were Kidnapped

The labor dispute between the French Electric and Water Company's tram and bus workers has been deadlocked for thirteen days. The opinions of both labor and management sometimes approach, and sometimes they are suddenly blocked. According to news received yesterday, the negotiations on the afternoon of the 7th broke down again. In addition to agreeing to add 5.5 yuan for rice subsidies and recognize the labor representatives, the management firmly refused to accept the newly formed labor union and a 60% increase in wages, so no solution could be reached. Yesterday, in addition to the labor representatives discussing countermeasures, the two sides did not continue negotiations. It was also learned that at 3 pm yesterday, Huang Yuanji, the ticket inspector No. 18 (from Nanxiang, living on Dagu Road) and Lu Hongjun, the ticket writer No. 27 (living in Xinxin Lane, Dapu Bridge, Rue du Père Froc), were kidnapped at the company's iron gate. It has been found that the company's ticket inspectors and ticket writers have been kidnapped eight times, and their whereabouts are still unknown. It was also reported that the No. 22 bus is still running in the French Concession. According to the company authorities, if the strike continues and is not resolved, they will increase the number of trams and buses and hire new workers to drive them to facilitate transportation. The French police are continuing to investigate the five kidnapped workers, but there are still no clues.

### American Soldier Assaulted and Insulted; Japan Has Officially Replied; Both Sides Do Not Disclose the Contents of the Reply; American Navy Says It Will Issue Another Announcement

The English-language American Great News reported that the American naval authorities in this city disclosed today (the 8th) that regarding the incident of a crew member of the American ship Augusta being assaulted and insulted by Japanese military police, the Japanese naval and military police authorities stationed in Shanghai replied yesterday (the 7th) to Admiral Haddock, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet. The reply from the Japanese Navy was signed by Lieutenant General Shimada, Commander of the Japanese Third Fleet stationed in China. The reply from the Japanese military police was signed by Major General Miura, Commander of the Japanese Military Police stationed in Shanghai. This morning, both the American and Japanese authorities refused to disclose the contents of the reply, but American naval officers said that a detailed announcement about this matter may be issued within a few days. According to reports, the incident of the American sailor being assaulted and insulted occurred on September 28 in the Bank of Communications Building at No. 14 The Bund. The relevant authorities have not issued an official announcement about this matter.

Official News

However, the Japanese authorities stated last week that this matter was a "minor drunken quarrel." The Japanese side had received a letter from an officer of the US Navy shore patrol that evening, explaining that the American sailor mistakenly believed that the Japanese military police headquarters in the Bank of Communications Building was a hotel and expressed regret. However, the US naval authorities said that the shore patrol officer's reply was made before he fully understood what had happened. Then, the American authorities in this area sent a note to the Japanese Navy and military police authorities, stating that the case should be further investigated. The Japanese side sent out a reply yesterday.

### Japanese Officer Shot; Died of Serious Injuries

The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now heard that the officer died yesterday due to the severity of his injuries.

### French Ambassador Cosme Finances Chinese Students; Establishes a Grant at Aurora University; Gifts 1,000 Yuan to the Top Students in Each Department

### French Concession Chinese Inspector Gong Bida Was Shot; Two Bullets Did Not Penetrate, and His Injuries Were Very Serious; The Gunman Escaped, and the Reason Is Awaiting Investigation

At the entrance of Ri Hui Li, Rue du Père Froc, in the French Concession, Deputy Chinese Inspector Gong Bida was suddenly shot by a rioter yesterday afternoon. Two shots hit his back, and his injuries were very serious. The perpetrator took the opportunity to escape without a trace. The details are listed below:

Served for a Long Time

Deputy Inspector Gong Bida (No. 210) of the Lukouwan Police Station is from Hubei and is 45 years old. He has served in the police station for 15 years. He rents at No. 25 Ri Hui Li, Xinxin Street, Rue du Père Froc, and is a second landlord. He and his wife, Ms. Mou, are inseparable and have a strong relationship. At about 12:30 pm yesterday, Gong was off duty in his dark blue uniform and was returning to his residence for lunch by rickshaw.

Hit by Two Bullets

Unexpectedly, just as the rickshaw arrived at the entrance of Ri Hui Li, a rioter wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants also came after him on a bicycle. Without asking the reason, he drew a gun and shot him twice. At that time, although Xi was wearing a police pistol, he was caught off guard and was shot in the back. The bullets did not penetrate, and he fainted and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Seeing that the goal had been achieved, the rioter hurriedly put away the gun and escaped on a bicycle.

Taken to the Hospital

After the incident, witnesses in the lane immediately reported to his family. When his wife rushed over, she saw Gong had fallen to the ground. She immediately called the police on duty and summoned an ambulance to the scene to take him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Because the police station was nearby, after hearing the alarm, they quickly drove a police car to the scene of the incident to arrest the perpetrator, but the perpetrator had disappeared. They picked up two bullet casings and took them back to the police station for inspection.

Reason Unknown

It is reported that although Gong's injuries were serious after being admitted to the hospital, he was still conscious. The doctor was preparing to perform surgery to remove the bullets, but due to excessive blood loss, his life could not be predicted. It is also learned that the police station is because Gong is diligent in his work and shrewd and capable. The reason why he was shot by a gangster this time is unknown. Now the police chief has ordered Chinese and Western police officers to track down the rioter and bring him to justice.

### Hong Kong's Freight Transportation to the Soviet Union Is Exceptionally Developed; The British Government Prevents Transshipment to Germany; Chinese Authorities' Certification Is Required

Since the Sino-Soviet barter trade agreement, China's trade with the Soviet Union has used Hong Kong as a transshipment center, and then transshipped to Vladivostok for sale to the Soviet Union. However, in order to strengthen the blockade, the British government has certain restrictions on exports to the Soviet Union to prevent transshipment from the Soviet Union to Germany. For Chinese native products transported from Hong Kong to the Soviet Union, an export certificate from the Chinese trade authority must be obtained before they can be loaded on a ship and exported from Hong Kong. It is learned that Hong Kong's trade with the Soviet Union is booming. From January to August this year, Hong Kong's trade with the Soviet Union totaled HK$53,274,690, more than doubling the same period last year. Compared with more than 6 million yuan in the same period of the previous year, the increase is even greater. Almost all the goods exported from Hong Kong to the Soviet Union are Chinese native products, with tea being the largest item, totaling 14.7 million yuan, an increase of more than 5 million yuan compared with 9 million yuan last year. The second largest item is ore, totaling more than 11 million yuan, of which tin ore, tungsten ore, and antimony ore are the most numerous, an increase of more than 20 times compared with last year. The next largest item is tung oil, which is 2.6 million yuan, and bristles and raw hides rank fourth, with 2.3 million yuan. As for the goods transported from the Soviet Union to Hong Kong, they total only 4.7 million yuan. The goods transported from the Soviet Union to China are all transported to China via the Sino-Soviet Highway. Recently, the China-Italy Company's Grand Wheel was rented to a Russian merchant to load a large amount of tea and tung oil in Hong Kong and transport them to Vladivostok for transshipment to the Soviet Union. The ship departed from Hong Kong yesterday and went to Keelung to load coal before heading straight to Vladivostok.

### Gold Bonds and National Defense Bonds Will Be Repaid and Interest Paid on Schedule

### Younger Brother Plots to Kill Older Brother, Both Confess to Crimes; Zhu Qitai Found to Have No Involvement and Granted Release

Zhou Xiude, a Chaozhou native residing at No. 49, Fengyu Lane, Sapo Sai Road in the French Concession, recently became addicted to gambling, and his family's financial resources were extremely meager. Overwhelmed with debt, he conceived a sinister idea because his older brother, Zhou Xiuzheng, held the important position of treasurer at the Liyuan Customs Brokerage at No. 19, Gongguan Road in the French Concession. He plotted to kill him and seize his wealth. Therefore, he colluded with Tao Defeng from Tongzhou, Ni Binqi from Haimen, and Tao's mistress, Wang Xiuzhen, a guide at the Queen's Tourist Agency on Shantou Road. On the night of August 24th, Zhou Xiude lured his brother Xiuzheng to room 528 of the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. First, he plied Xiuzheng with wine and women to get him drunk. Then, taking advantage of his inebriated state, they strangled Xiuzheng with a rope, obtained the key to the Liyuan silver box from the deceased's person, and went to the brokerage, stealing US$580 in banknotes and checks for $2600 before fleeing. However, the matter was discovered by Liu Junjie, a Chinese detective, and detective Zhang Bingchun from the Lao Zha Gate Police Station. They apprehended the aforementioned individuals and a suspect, Zhu Qitai, and handed them over to the Special No. 1 Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen continued the trial in the Criminal Division. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated the case, prosecuting Zhou Xiude under Article 272 of the Criminal Law for the crime of killing a direct relative. Tao Defeng, Ni Baoqi, and Wang Xiuzhen were prosecuted under Article 271 of the same law for murder. As for Zhu Qitai, he was found to have no involvement, and a request was made for his release. After questioning by Judge Xiao, all the accused confessed to their crimes without denial. As a result, the court ordered a postponement for further verification, released Zhu Qitai, and remanded the others in custody.

### Training Boiler Operators to Reduce Public Housing Expenses

The Industrial Section of the Public Works Department, in order to reduce the cost of hot water equipment in various public housing this winter, has suggested the following two measures to the owners of apartments located east of Jing'an Temple to the Bund: (1) According to the regulations of the Public Works Department, any boiler must have a formal inspection certificate. This certificate should be issued by a registered boiler inspection engineer. Apartment owners whose boilers have already undergone inspection this year should immediately request the inspection engineer to conduct an inspection and find ways to modify and improve them in order to save maintenance costs and maximize their efficiency. A list of approved registered inspection engineers can be obtained from the Industrial Section. (2) The Industrial Section plans to organize a training class for boiler operators, specifically for training boiler operators in apartments located in the aforementioned areas. The location is set at the Health Sub-Office at No. 340 Hankou Road, with classes scheduled to begin on October 21st, twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays, starting at 7:00 PM. A registered Chinese engineer will be the instructor, paying special attention to economical and safe methods of burning boilers. The course is expected to last five weeks. Apartment owners who wish to send their boiler operators to the class can register in writing with the Industrial Section from now on. The section is scheduled to handle the registration of trainees at No. 340 Hankou Road at 7:00 PM on the 14th of this month.

### Robbery at Heng De Li

At 11:10 AM yesterday, a robber suddenly entered the Guangdong Road 288 branch of Heng De Li Watch & Clock Shop in the Public Concession. He placed a round paper package on the counter. The shop assistant, seeing the package, suspected it contained a hand grenade and dared not resist. The robber then stole two watches and $78 in cash before fleeing. The shop assistant followed and reported the incident to the police, who apprehended the robber and recovered the stolen goods and the paper package. Upon opening it, it was found to contain a tin can.

### This Year's Epidemic Patients Far More Than Last Year

According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency's inquiry with Mr. Deng Qingshan, the medical director of the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, the situation of this year's epidemic is as follows: From the start of free consultations at the hospital's epidemic department on July 1st to September 30th, the total number of outpatient visits was 35,028, the number of regular outpatient visits was 19,185, and the number of hospitalized epidemic patients was 2,581. As for true cholera, there were 328 cases. The total number of epidemic patients was 56,800, a figure far higher than last year. Currently, true cholera has not yet disappeared, with two to six patients seeking treatment every day. Therefore, residents should still be cautious about their health.

### Taxed Foreign Goods Remade Subject to Domestic Goods Tax

The Ministry of Finance, in order to rectify transit taxes, has stipulated that all goods manufactured or constructed domestically from taxed foreign raw materials, or foreign goods that have been adulterated or diluted after import, or whose original state has been altered by other means, shall be regarded as domestic goods. They shall be subject to transit tax uniformly upon re-export. Regarding the procedures for collecting transit tax on domestic goods: (1) In areas where customs offices are established, transit tax shall still be collected by the customs. (2) In provinces where customs offices were originally established, transit tax shall be collected by the freight inspection branch offices until the previously withdrawn checkpoints are restored. (3) In places where no customs checkpoints are established, transit tax shall be temporarily collected by the freight inspection office until customs offices are established.

### YWCA Appeals for Winter Clothing

The Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) has recently noted that, even before the height of winter, the number of people coming to seek discarded winter clothing has been increasing daily. However, their old stock is depleted, making it difficult to provide widespread assistance. Fearing that they will be unable to cope when the severe cold arrives, they are taking precautionary measures by appealing to all sectors of society for a large quantity of worn-out clothing, garments, quilts, and bedding. They hope that enthusiastic individuals will provide strong support and benefit the poor. If donations are made in cash, the YWCA can also purchase and prepare items on behalf of donors.

Life Sketch

### One Day of a Pay Raise

— Bai Xi

As the hour hand on the clock approached five o'clock, people who had been sitting blankly in the office all day began to become active; the monotonous and unpleasant harmony of abacuses and typewriters stopped, replaced by noisy conversations and intermittent laughter.

"Old Zhang, I got a 20% bonus today, let's go have a good meal."

"Okay, Western food or Chinese food?"

"I think Western food is better, let's go for cheap eats, okay?"

"Good, with this rainy weather, the restaurants aren't doing business, so the side dishes must be especially authentic, maybe even extra."

"Old Wang, now that I'm full of energy, I can go dancing all night to get my fill!"

"What you're saying all costs money. Only I have a good way to eat and play without spending money. If you're happy, you can come with me."

"Hmm. Needless to say, you're going to the same old place, right? Sitting in a car, eating free food, who wouldn't be happy? But you have to be careful, a fifty-dollar allowance isn't enough for two slaps!"

"Old Qian, did you cover your Citibank short position?"

"No, I still have to watch the situation! Now that the Sino-American loan is established, the news is bad, so it's really good to short it!"

"The exchange rate is dropping, but things are getting more expensive, and foreign Xian rice has risen to more than seventy yuan a dan! Alas, what's the use of this 20% subsidy? It's really hard to live on Liangxiang chestnuts!"

"That's right, only people like Lao Shen in the manager's office can survive. They beg this and beg that, and finally get the foreigners to take pity and agree to give everyone a 20% raise, but what everyone gets is always five or six yuan, not enough to buy a dou of rice. Lao Shen doesn't spend any effort, but he gets a full seventy old yuan all at once, really has a way!"

"Do you know that the foreigners themselves got a 50% raise this month?"

"Things in the world are originally like this! Fairness is simply empty talk. People with rice hoard white rice to fatten the mice, watching the poor scratch their bellies in hunger!"

While everyone was gathered in a group talking and laughing, an ordinary clerk sitting in the corner of the office was still constantly flipping through the heavy ledger, circling in the pile of numbers. Although he didn't say anything, the conversations of others were heard in his ears, and chaotic thoughts surged in his mind. Just now, when others received a subsidy for a dan of rice, he was lucky enough to receive five yuan, which was only enough to buy five sheng of rice. He thought of the sad faces of his family suffering from hunger, and heavily took the five yuan, just like a long-awaited rain. He thought that he could sell five sheng of rice today, and everyone could eat porridge for two days; but then he thought that his wife had been groaning in bed for more than ten days, and he should take her to see a doctor and take medicine... Interrupting his thoughts were the sounds of the clock striking five o'clock. He raised his head and looked out the window. The rainstorm was raging, like thousands of troops galloping.

"Who wants to take a car, eight jiao a person, the group bus is very comfortable!"

He silently took off his shoes and socks in the corner, rolled up his trousers high, ready to fight the heavy rain!

### Small Statistics

— Yuan Shan

According to the report of Xie Qi from the dance hall group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Widow Encouragement Committee: From August 1st to 30th, Class A dance halls raised 7,714 yuan; based on the calculation that this amount is one jiao for every yuan donated by widows, then its original amount is 77,140 yuan. Class B dance halls raised 1,863 yuan and 2.5 jiao; based on the calculation that this amount is five fen for every yuan donated by widows, then its original amount is 37,265 yuan. Adding the two amounts together, it totals 114,405 yuan; and this amount only refers to the two dance halls mentioned in the report. Combining all the income of all dance halls in Shanghai, it should be more than this amount. Disregarding the spirit and time consumed for this and not mentioning it, if we simply take this amount to do beneficial undertakings, it is certainly not difficult to definitely discover considerable achievements.

### Believe It or Not, If Rice Gets More Expensive

— Ji

If rice gets more expensive: Friends of the small salary class, their monthly income will not even be able to buy one liter of rice!

If rice gets more expensive: Shanghai landlords who sublet, not to mention they can't come up with another increase in rent like before; even if they are willing to give people a 50% discount on the original rent, I'm afraid no one would dare to accept it, because at this time everyone will be going to other places to find a way to make a living.

If rice gets more expensive: The wealthy and well-fed people of Shanghai will not have to use their property in relief efforts, but will have to use it entirely to protect their safety!

If rice gets more expensive: The court will have to issue such a notice: "From now on, in all criminal and civil cases, the food for prisoners during the period of imprisonment will be borne entirely by the plaintiff."

Hawthorne Case

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Nine: Astonishing News

Yu Gantang replied: "Although I only saw the shape of his back, I definitely won't be mistaken. At that time, I became suspicious, but because that female classmate was beside me and it was raining heavily, it was inconvenient to stop the car. After I returned to the dormitory, the more I thought about it, the more suspicious I became, and I really couldn't sleep, so I came out of the dormitory again and went to Lilan's house, wanting to see if there had been any changes. When I arrived at her house, there was no light in the downstairs parlor, but the electric light in the dining room was still on, and Jinmei was also downstairs, not asleep. I knew something was wrong. When I was about to go in, Jinmei happened to walk out of the dining room, saw me, and waved to me. So I didn't go in."

Hawthorne nodded secretly, saying to himself, "This woman is really not easy to deal with. She may still hold the key to this secret case." He looked at me, and I nodded slightly as well, indicating that I had the same suspicions about this maid. He then continued to ask: "Did you talk to Jinmei at that time?"

The young man said: "No, she just waved to me from inside, and I got her signal, feeling that there must be something inconvenient to go in, so of course I didn't have the chance to talk to her. Then I returned to the dormitory, knowing clearly in my heart that something must have happened to Lilan, so I couldn't close my eyes. Early this morning, I rushed to my friend Song Zhaoqi's house in Changmingli, wanting to discuss it with him and then decide on a course of action. Zhaoqi hadn't gotten up yet, and after waiting for a long time, I was able to start a secret conversation with him. I told him the whole situation, but he advised me not to be involved in this matter. He guessed that something might become big, and it wasn't worth it for me to get involved. Thinking about it now, his advice was indeed very meaningful. But at the time, I just felt that he wasn't being a good friend and wasn't willing to help me. I argued with him for a long time, but there was no result. I was determined to go to Lilan's house again, but he tried his best to stop me, and also kept me at his place for breakfast. After thinking about it again and again, I felt that no matter what, I couldn't stand by. So I finally didn't listen to Zhaoqi's advice, and I went to Qingpu Road. When I arrived at her house, Lilan's body was just being carried out of the door. I did risk opening the quilt a little to take a look, and only then did I know that Lilan had really been beaten to death—had been beaten to death by Zhao Boxiong.

Yu Gantang paused slightly. The light of anger shot out from his eyes, stared at Hawthorne, and then shifted his gaze away, as if the following words were a little difficult to say. Hawthorne seemed to have seen through his thoughts, so he took over for him. Hawthorne said: "At that time, since you had already determined that Zhao Boxiong had beaten Lilan to death, you decided to avenge her; you went to see Song Zhaoqi again, insisting on borrowing a handgun from him: he still refused to agree, trying his best to dissuade you, and you even started arguing like you were going crazy, and insisted on borrowing it; he had no choice but to lend you an empty handgun without bullets—"

### The Cost of a Manuscript

— Wanli

When each manuscript is submitted, the cost spent by the author is only slightly less than the royalties he receives. If you don’t believe it, let’s temporarily calculate the royalties we receive at an average of two yuan per thousand words (some are less than two yuan), then each thousand words costs at least three sheets of manuscript paper, averaging two fen per sheet, three sheets cost six fen (not counting drafts and mistakes): one envelope, three fen; four fen for postage; although other expenses such as ink and pen nibs are limited, they are ultimately expenses and damages. After the manuscript is sent out, every day you have to get up earlier to buy a newspaper to see if your article has been published. If it takes five days to a week to be published, the cost will be even greater. Fortunately, it is published, but the royalties can only be obtained next month, and when you go to collect the royalties, you have to spend some money on transportation. After spending so much time and energy, stretching your neck, you finally get these rewards, and whether it is published or not is still a question.

### Starting with Liang Hongyu

— Tourist Reporter

The story of Liang Hongyu has long been passed down in history books. The deeds of this female national hero of a generation, brought to the screen at this time and place, I think it does contain extremely profound and positive meanings.

After "Mulan Joins the Army," the Shanghai film industry once mistakenly entered the wrong path of folk tale films. Among them, Jin Xing's "Li Xiangjun" naturally gave the audience a good impression. Now, Hua Xi's "Liang Hongyu" also gives us a new feeling. In terms of content, the material of "Liang Hongyu" is not only more intentional and profound than the aforementioned two films, but also feels very intimate and intuitive compared with the plays "Last Regret of the Ming Dynasty" and "Motherland."

We oppose yellow films that humiliate our own culture, but we also bravely give enthusiastic sympathy to films with positive content. Like "Liang Hongyu," it tells the audience—national interests are above all else. She, for the sake of her husband Han Shizhong's mistake in losing a military opportunity and letting the criminals escape, felt that reason should overcome love. She returned to the Song court alone to impeach her husband and request that he be punished as he deserved. Although that was hundreds of years ago, the spirit of Liang Hongyu is still worthy of inheritance, learning and promotion by the Chinese children of today.

I am happy to recommend films like "Liang Hongyu" to the audience.

### The Civet Cat Harms the Hibiscus Grass (Part 2)

— New Voice

Bad Luck Ends and Good Fortune Comes Late in Life

The facts are as follows: Since the Civet Cat for Crown Prince was discontinued, the Da Chan stage has gradually declined, with each day worse than the last. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Furongcao resigned from the troupe and soon returned to her hometown in Beiping. Fortunately, she had mixed in Shanghai for several years and had quite a bit of money on hand, enough to live a hard life without worrying about food and clothing. At that time, the pear garden industry in the old capital was very developed, with dozens of male and female actor troupes. They found Furongcao's performance skills to be good, and everyone was vying to hire him. Furongcao adhered to realism, agreeing to whoever came. As a result, Furongcao's reputation suddenly expanded. It was also his fate to become successful. Whenever female actors came to Shanghai, they would desperately bring Furongcao with them. First, they could borrow some strength; second, he could temporarily explain plays that they didn't know. The pay started from 1,200 yuan and went all the way up to more than 3,000 yuan, which was considered quite a big deal. Later, whenever leading female roles came to Shanghai to perform, almost all of them couldn't do without him. A casual saying was, "Is Furongcao going?" Can you see how much Qi Ti Si is? Huangjin Changju, knowing that Furongcao was an indispensable red role for female roles, had the idea of ​​"long-term employment". First, they could save money on the plate; second, they could reduce the number of sentences; third, they could reduce the trouble of picking up and dropping off each time; fourth, they could limit the gradual increase in pay; (the pay for red roles is bound to increase every time,) this plan achieves four goals with one move, it's really thanks to them for thinking it up. Once the idea was decided, they began to discuss with Furongcao. He initially wanted 30,000 yuan, but after a lot of talking, it ended up with a long-term agreement of 20,000 yuan. From then on, the role of Furongcao became Huangjin's exclusive product. However, Furongcao also had his own plans. One, the female roles who came to Shanghai were not necessarily there every month, and even if they were, they might not necessarily be able to bring him along; second, he and his wife were people with hobbies, and smokers were most inconvenient for long-distance travel. Now, living in Shanghai for a long time can not only reduce a lot of trouble, but also avoid inspections by police officers at various wharves. For these reasons, when Huangjin's representative contacted him, he agreed very simply.

The Zhiyuan Drama Society is a powerful force among the student drama groups in Shanghai. It was established in Zhenru, and after "August 13th," the members revived it in the concession. It has performed nine public performances successively, like a wave, making its own contribution to pushing the waves of the entire drama movement. This time, they are preparing to hold their tenth public performance on the National Day of Double Tenth at the Russian Art Theater. The script for the public performance is the famous Mr. Yu Ling's "Women's Apartment", directed by Mr. Ye Min.

The script of "Women's Apartment" is almost known to everyone. In the past, quite a few drama troupes have performed this play. It has also been made into a movie, causing a sensation for a time. The actors of the Zhiyuan Drama Society, based on the serious and learning attitude that their students should have, coupled with the leadership of famous directors, will definitely capture the essence of every previous lesson" and crystallize higher art. I wish the Zhiyuan Drama Society an artistic victory on the Ren Shi Festival National Day!

### Calligraphy, Painting, and Chrysanthemum Exhibition by the Orphanage for Refugee Children

— Organized

With Various Amusements to Add to the Entertainment

Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Shanghai Relief and Education Center for Refugee Children, oversees more than 600 refugee children in the orphanage. There are no dedicated funds for their care, and all expenses rely on generous donations from all sectors of society. Now that the weather is getting colder, funds for winter clothing are still lacking. He convened people from all walks of life to discuss solutions. It was unanimously agreed that since Shanghai has become an isolated island, theaters and dance halls are thriving, but refined entertainment such as flower viewing and book reading is rarely seen. Why not take this opportunity to promote and refresh the senses? Therefore, a calligraphy, painting, and chrysanthemum exhibition was initiated. The venue has been borrowed from the Continental Swimming Pool on Jing'an Temple Road and has been approved. The date is set from the 24th of this month to the 3rd of November. Immediately, personnel were sent to collectors, calligraphers, painters, and chrysanthemum growers to contact them separately. Over a thousand pieces of calligraphy and paintings by famous figures, both ancient and modern, have been received, covering all dynasties from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing. In terms of calligraphy, all styles of regular, cursive, clerical, and seal scripts are available. In terms of painting, there is no lack of figures, birds, flowers, landscapes, and so on. There are over six thousand pots of various chrysanthemums, with countless shapes and forms, supplemented by bonsai and fish birds. Various entertainers, famous amateurs, and celebrities are also invited to perform amusements to add to the entertainment. Admission tickets are priced at fifty cents each, and voucher tickets are divided into one yuan and five yuan denominations. These vouchers can be used to purchase calligraphy, paintings, and chrysanthemums inside, according to the standard legal tender, without discount. All proceeds from the tickets will be used to fund winter clothing for refugee children. This event brings together the essence of artistic endeavors to create a grand occasion, showcasing the exquisite beauty of chrysanthemums and the treasures of art. Investing in the purchase of tickets not only provides various artistic pleasures to admire, delighting the heart and mind, but also helps refugee children, allowing them to avoid the danger of freezing and starvation. It is a win-win situation, why not do it?
