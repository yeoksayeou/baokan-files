### Details of the Chinese Army's Attack on Baotou: Intercepting Japanese Army's Telegram for Assistance, Then Attacking, Guerrilla Forces Disrupting the Japanese Rear as Assistance

Chongqing: Detailed information about the Chinese army's attack on Baotou has just arrived here from Suiyuan. It is said that the purpose of the Chinese army's attack was to recover Baotou in order to disrupt the Japanese army's plan to advance further west after the Yellow River freezes. A special circumstance in this decisive battle was the lack of convenient transportation in the Mongolian plains. According to the Sui West Chinese Army Headquarters, the Chinese army launched its attack on Baotou after intercepting a Japanese radio message issued from Baotou on December 18 requesting reinforcements. According to a letter issued on December 21 from Shangbai (transliteration) in Sui West, the Chinese army, under the personal leadership of General Fu Zuoyi, Chairman of Sui, launched a multi-pronged attack on December 12. It is reported that a squadron of the Chinese Air Force heavily bombed the Ping Sui Railway and the Japanese barracks east of Baotou before the Chinese army launched its offensive. When the Chinese regular army launched its offensive, guerrilla forces disrupted the Japanese rear, providing active assistance. The first route of the Chinese army advanced eastward from Sui West towards Baotou on December 12. The second route attacked Saqi from Sui South. The third route cut off the railway to Datong northwest of Sui East. The Chinese army on the Chahar border also advanced to the railway line near Zhangjiakou. A squadron of Hui cavalry went to the Mongolian grasslands north of Baotou to protect the flanks of the Chinese army. The Chinese army secretly detoured, passing through 300 kilometers of Mongolian territory, hiding during the day and traveling at night. When they traveled through the Mongolian grasslands at full speed, they did not carry tents or cooking stoves. Each soldier carried several pounds of flatbread. Water was scarce along the way, and water bottles were useless in temperatures of minus 30 degrees Celsius. Therefore, each soldier drank water only once every 24 hours on average.

They were intercepted by the Chinese army en route. After a fierce battle into the night, more than 500 Japanese soldiers were killed, and many war trophies were captured. (11th dispatch)

Chongqing: The attention of the Chinese in this area to the Sino-Japanese war is still focused on South China. It is generally expected that the war in that area will soon restart. There are two reasons for this: (1) The Chinese army is stepping up its offensive in the Nanning area. (2) It is rumored that Wang Jingwei is planning to establish a puppet government in Guangzhou. According to telegrams from the Chinese army in front of Nanning, the Chinese army is now preparing to launch another offensive northeast of Nanning. The traffic between Nanning and Kunlun Pass, which was cut off by the Chinese army in late December, was once restored by the Japanese army, but it has now been cut off again by the Chinese army. It is reported that after a fierce attack, the Chinese army has recovered Wutang, 17 miles southeast of Nanning, and Qitang, 23 miles away. At the same time, according to Chinese sources, Japanese aircraft have heavily bombed various cities in Guinan. Yesterday, Guilin had air raid alerts all day. The extent of the damage has not yet been reported in detail. It is also reported that the Japanese are currently rushing reinforcements into the Nanning area. It is reported that the construction of a port by the Japanese at Longmen near Qinzhou has been completed. Chinese sources generally expect that after the Japanese have completed the construction of the port, they will begin landing large-scale troops and equipment. It is said that the arrival of Japanese reinforcements can now be seen at various points north of Nanning. (11th Reuters dispatch)

### Cantonese Chinese Army Marches Directly Towards Xinjie

Zhaoqing: A few days ago, the Chinese army launched attacks across the river from two routes. One route marched directly towards Xinjie along Yinzhan'ao, and the other route detoured through Shijiao and Guotai, copying out Chi and Baini.

One force of about 3,000 people is currently being annihilated by the Chinese in the area between Yinzhan'ao and Shijiao. (11th dispatch)

Wengyuan: At 10:00 this morning, the Chinese army killed many Japanese soldiers in Conghua. The remaining Japanese forces retreated in disarray towards Guangzhou. The Chinese are taking advantage of the victory to search forward. (11th dispatch)

A dispatch from a certain location in Northern Guangdong: The Japanese army retreating from Qinglonggang is continuing to retreat. There is now definitely no trace of the Japanese north of Qinglonggang. The Chinese army is pursuing them. (Central 10th dispatch)

It is reported that the authorities have issued a commendation order. (11th dispatch)

### Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Solemnly Denies Rumors

Chongqing: At a reception for news reporters this afternoon, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson solemnly denied rumors that the "New Central Government" plan had reached an understanding with the Chongqing National Government. The spokesperson also strongly stated that the National Government has no relationship with any puppet regime, either in fact or in law. (11th Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing: Well-informed Chinese sources here generally expect that a puppet government will soon be established in Guangzhou. It is rumored that the Japanese army has recently launched a northward attack on Shaoguan along the railway in Guangdong, with the intention of preparing for the establishment of a puppet regime in South China. The failure of the Japanese army's offensive will likely affect this plan. Gu Mengyu's recent arrival in Chongqing has also dealt a blow to this plan. Gu arrived in Chongqing by air from Hong Kong last month and is reported to have made a firm statement opposing the peace movement. Gu had very successful talks with various government leaders and flew back to Hong Kong on December 14. (11th Reuters dispatch)

### Chinese Army in Northern Jiangxi Captures Mahui Ridge

Xiushui: Starting on the evening of the 9th, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on Mahui Ridge, Qiujin, and Guilin Bridge from three routes. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, they finally recovered Mahui Ridge and Qiujin this morning, and destroyed the railway between De'an and Jiujiang. On one side they besieged De'an and on the other they advanced towards Jiujiang Xingzi. In this battle, more than 700 Japanese soldiers were annihilated, and the Chinese captured countless weapons and ammunition. (11th dispatch)

Editorial

### Mr. Volleys' Proposal

Yesterday's newspaper carried a Washington dispatch, reporting that Democratic Congressman Volleys expressed his views on the Far East issue, advocating that "the United States, Japan, and other countries stationing troops within China should agree to withdraw all of them, so that the Chinese can handle everything themselves without interference from other countries, which is the reasonable solution to various difficulties in the Far East." Mr. Volleys' implication is that he believes this proposal is a perceptive and insightful view of the Far East situation and has a constructive nature. Therefore, he plans to exchange views with the U.S. authorities in the near future. If international relations seek long-term peace and stability, and if disputes are ultimately resolved based on common sense and reason, then we firmly believe that Mr. Volleys' proposal will be adopted by all parties. Even today, the simplest and most reasonable way to resolve the difficulties in the Far East is to promote the realization of Mr. Volleys' proposal. We would like to elaborate further on Mr. Volleys' proposal.

The stationing of troops in China by various countries, based on treaties, is a legacy of the 19th century. China has always respected treaties, so even though it knows that it is unreasonable for foreign troops to be stationed within its borders, it has never demanded that various countries withdraw their troops. The rights of various countries in China are also best guaranteed by China's respect for treaties, and are by no means dependent on the stationing of troops. Therefore, in terms of the relationship between China and various countries, there is fundamentally no need to station troops. As for troops outside the treaties, their nature and actions can only be interpreted as aggression. China must resist aggressor troops when they attack, and must drive them away when they are stationary. This inevitably leads to a state of war. Ending the war requires either the defeat and collapse of the aggressor troops or their withdrawal. Therefore, in terms of the facts, at least troop withdrawal is the inevitable outcome. If aggressor troops attempt to obtain treaty-based justification for continuing to be stationed within Chinese borders, this is a treaty that the Chinese people and government will absolutely not accept. To reiterate, the impossibility of this kind of attempt is like trying to revert the 20th century back to the 19th century, equally impossible. If aggressors say that treaties require the stationing of troops, it is tantamount to saying that aggression is indispensable, that continuing the war is indispensable. Resistance is originally something China does not shrink from, but it is far from the aggressors' hoped-for resolution of the dispute!

Mr. Volleys hopes that the Japanese will not disregard his suggestion. We assert that Japan's aggression is ultimately doomed to failure, so it will ultimately be unable to disregard Mr. Volleys' suggestion, but that is not what we are talking about today. Today, the Japanese consciousness is in a state of turmoil, its actions are in a state of perversity, and its consciousness and actions are in a state of contradiction. Therefore, toward China, it flaunts morality but continues to plunder, hopes for peace but continues to wage war, and is exhausted and weakened but remains ambitious. Toward the international community, Britain, the United States, Germany, and the Soviet Union, it does not know what to do, and toward the United States it cries, laughs, complains, and flatters, and still does not know what to do. Domestically, there are recent politically confused political upheavals. In the case of such a Japan, how is Mr. Volleys' hope that it will not disregard his suggestion any different from expecting a madman to accept reason? Or has Mr. Volleys ever diagnosed the symptoms? If a tranquilizer were administered at the beginning of his madness, it could be expected that he would return to tranquility. If his diet were cut off at the beginning of his madness, it could be expected that he would quickly conform. Unfortunately, the international community at the beginning not only failed to use treaties and justice to tranquilize him, but also used politeness to encourage his arrogance, and used arms and raw materials to enhance his strength, and thus he has been mad for a long time until today. Now he is both mad and exhausted. For the plan today, how should effective sanctions be launched from various aspects of diplomacy and economy to weaken his mad strength, to restrict his mad behavior, and thereby to promote the restoration of his reason? We believe that what Mr. Volleys proposes are the conditions for resolving the Far East dispute after Japan has restored its reason. To promote its restoration of reason, the U.S. Congress must first take action in diplomacy and economy. Is Mr. Volleys speaking nonsense?

### Former U.S. Secretary of State Stimson Advocates Banning Arms and Raw Materials to Japan, Advocates that the U.S. Should Refuse to Mediate in the Sino-Japanese War, Most U.S. Congressmen Tend to Sanction Japan, Various Chinese Universities Urge the U.S. Not to Aid Aggression

New York: Former U.S. Secretary of State Stimson wrote a letter to the New York Times today, stating that in order for Japan to recognize the U.S.'s true feelings toward Japan, he advocated legislation to ban the export of arms, ammunition, and all raw materials that can be used for combat to Japan. "Only in this way can we show the world how much we value just international relations, especially respect for treaties and the integrity, sovereignty, and independence of Chinese territory. At the same time, it can make the Japanese understand that our claims are by no means a game for children." According to Stimson, U.S. merchants supply Japan with ore seedlings, scrap iron, scrap steel, kerosene, and other items. Although the number has been relatively small in the past three years, the U.S. State Department may be able to impose a mental embargo on these items. However, in order to make the Japanese understand the feelings of the American people on this issue, it seems that Congress should legislate to let Japan know the true attitude of the American people on this issue. This kind of expression from the U.S. will certainly enable Japanese militarists to abandon their current policies. If Japan's policies do not change, then the balance of power in East Asia, the balance of power that the U.S. is most concerned about and that is now threatened by Japan, will inevitably be unable to stabilize. Stimson also said that this policy of the U.S. can strengthen the excellent results since the abolition of the arms embargo. At the same time, it can show that the American people "inherently have the courage to clearly distinguish between right and wrong." Stimson continued that this bill of the U.S. will definitely not lead to war, because "war against the U.S. is what the Japanese government least wants." This can be clearly demonstrated by the fact that the U.S. declared the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which did not cause any trouble. Stimson also said, "At present, there are quite a few parties that hope the U.S. will come forward to mediate the Sino-Japanese war, but these parties, if you seek common clues, are clearly Japan." He also said that what the U.S. is concerned about in the Far East is not just narrow commercial interests at present, but that it hopes that both China and Japan, and even the Soviet Union, can be independent of each other and not devour each other. As for the recent Japanese military force, it has become weaker, while China's self-confidence has become stronger, so he asked the American people to strictly reject the Japanese side's invitation for the U.S. to come forward to mediate, "because I deeply believe that this mediation work will not only be doomed to failure, but will also make the U.S. lose credibility with China and discredit itself in the Far East, because this move will completely abandon the principles that the U.S. has strived to uphold in the Far East for half a century. Finally, the interests of the U.S. in the entire Far East region will suffer a serious blow." (11th United Press dispatch)

New York: After former Secretary of State Stimson wrote a letter to the New York Times advocating banning the transportation of arms and various raw materials to Japan, the newspaper recently published an article commenting on it, saying: "We believe that the vast majority of the American people share the same feelings as Mr. Stimson. In other words, the fact that Japan has launched an act of aggression against China without provocation is very obvious, and the tactics adopted by Japan are extremely crude, and its goal is clearly to plunder Chinese land and conquer the Chinese nation. We believe that before the U.S. individually prohibits the transportation of certain goods, such as gasoline and iron ore, to Japan, it should contact the governments of other countries to learn to what extent those countries are willing to cooperate with the U.S. in cutting off Japan's supplies, because after the U.S. bans the transportation of various goods to Japan, whether Japanese militarists will turn to other markets to obtain various items, and whether the other signatory countries of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty are willing to support the U.S. in spirit in preserving China's territorial integrity. We must know the above two aspects." (11th Havas dispatch)

Washington: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman stated again yesterday that before the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation is abolished, he will temporarily not take action on the resolution to ban exports to Japan. Pittman also said that in the first meeting of the Foreign Relations Committee yesterday, he did not mention the issue of U.S.-Japan relations. The meeting was of a secret nature and only involved the appointment of new diplomatic personnel, but Congress generally advocates implementing a ban on the transportation of military supplies to Japan. Even Republican Senator Kappa, who has always been known to be pro-Japanese, has changed his attitude of opposition and expressed sympathy for the case. In addition, Democratic Senator Swedenbar said that even if Japan respects the interests of the U.S. in China, he also advocates sanctioning Japan. He also pointed out that the people on the west coast of the U.S. unanimously oppose Japan's aggression in China. At the same time, the isolationists in the Senate still oppose the embargo on goods to Japan. (11th United Press dispatch)

Chongqing: The presidents of 22 Chinese universities (two-thirds of whom are American returnees) jointly sent a telegram to U.S. Vice President Garner and members of the U.S. Congress today, stating that if the U.S. continues to sign a new commercial treaty with Japan now, then its previous declaration of abolishing the commercial treaty will become a meaningless move. What is more, if the U.S. signs a new commercial treaty with Japan, Japan will become even more elated and intensify its aggression against China. As a result, it will inevitably force the U.S. to withdraw from the Far East. This kind of policy that only cares about immediate interests is incompatible with the broad vision of the U.S. government and people. In short, if the U.S. takes a tough stance, it will definitely deal a fatal blow to Japan's economic institutions and promote the collapse of Japan's military institutions. (11th United Press dispatch)

### Abe Cabinet Prepares to Resign, Submits Resignation After Approving the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement, The Military Prefers Konoe as the Successor Prime Minister

Hong Kong: Tokyo dispatch, according to the Daily News, there will be the most important developments in the political situation on the 14th or 15th. Abe has given up the idea of dealing with the parliament with a tough attitude because he sees that the intentions of politicians with status in the military and political circles are becoming worse. Abe will attend a Privy Council meeting on the 13th, at which time the protocol of the provisional Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement will be submitted for discussion. That afternoon, the heads of the five major political parties will be invited to a meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence to report on the government's basic political program toward China (the new regime). The Asahi Shimbun summarized the achievements of the three cabinets of Konoe, Hiranuma, and Abe, and criticized the important political figures, saying that the powerful cabinet (unanimously supported by the whole country) that they organized was only in name. They hoped that they would be able to form a powerful cabinet with a firm determination and with the greatest strength this time. (11th dispatch)

Tokyo: This morning, all the newspapers said that Prime Minister Abe will resign and step down after the Privy Council approves the provisional Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement on Saturday. If Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Yuasa and Privy Councilor Konoe can find a successor who can be accepted by the army, navy, political circles, financial circles, and business circles, then Abe's resignation will be submitted on Sunday or Monday. The Asahi Shimbun mentioned this matter and said that all relevant parties, including senior politicians close to the Emperor and military and political circles, now have their own hopes and are making their own speculations, which is very chaotic. Before these hopes and speculations are unified, all kinds of ups and downs are inevitable. It is expected that a special cabinet meeting will be held on January 15, at which time Abe will express his determination to resign. According to the speculation of informed sources, the new prime minister may be a retired soldier, but it is also possible for a current officer to take on the work of forming a cabinet. The responsibility for recommending a new prime minister to the Emperor now rests with Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Yuasa, but he may still need to consult with elder statesman Saionji. (11th Reuters dispatch)

Tokyo: As the issue of a new beginning in the political situation becomes increasingly urgent, the actions of Prince Konoe, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Yuasa, and Lord Haraa Kumao have suddenly become more active. From the military's point of view, after a new beginning in the political situation, Prince Konoe is the only one who can solve the problems, so Prince Konoe's assumption of office is the most appropriate. All parties are paying close attention to this at present. (11th Allied Press dispatch)

### Intensifying Internal Strife Between Japanese Military and Civilian Factions; Japanese Army in North China Opposes the Puppet New Regime

Manila: The "Manila Bulletin" commented today that the Japanese army in North China has hinted at its opposition to the "new central government" headed by Wang Jingwei, indicating an intensification of internal strife between the Japanese military and civilian factions regarding the war in China. If the Japanese army, or influential elements within it, openly oppose the "Wang regime," then the "Wang regime" will certainly not last. News from Beiping further proves that the attitude of the North China army towards the Tokyo authorities is becoming increasingly independent or resistant. The attitude of the North China army will increase the difficulty of establishing a "Wang regime" under the control of Tokyo and will ultimately lead to the failure of this effort. (United Press International dispatch of the 11th)

There are no restrictions on the redemption of principal and interest; upon maturity, certificate holders can apply to post offices in the mainland for redemption. (Dispatch of the 11th)

### Random Notes on British and German Navies

The British Navy currently has eleven battleships, three battlecruisers, thirteen heavy cruisers, forty-eight light cruisers, six aircraft carriers, two hundred and fifteen destroyers, fifty-six submarines, and three hundred and eighty-six other vessels, for a total of seven hundred and thirty-eight ships. Its primary mission is to protect Britain from enemy invasion, its second mission is to blockade Germany, and its third mission is to counter German warships and submarine attacks and protect Britain's maritime shipping.

Since 1652, the British Navy has not been defeated once. Historical British naval admirals such as Hawkins, Drake, Blake, and Howe are still admired by naval officers. Admiral Nelson, who defeated Napoleon, is revered as a sacred figure. British naval officers are familiar with the ocean and skilled in navigation, far surpassing naval officers of any other country in the world. This is the result of centuries of dedicated training. British naval officers are tenured for life, receive strict training, and emphasize book knowledge over creative ability. This is the so-called "Dartmouth System." Dartmouth is the only school in Britain that trains naval officers, selecting forty-five students at the age of thirteen each year. Each student's parents must guarantee that their child will pursue the navy as a lifelong career; failure to do so will result in a significant fine. Each prospective student is disqualified if they are missing seven or more teeth, have teeth that cannot be repaired, suffer from enuresis, or are too obese. The curriculum includes mathematics, science, engineering, French, English, history, and geography. They must also study the Bible and navigation for two hours each week. They must wake up at 7:00 AM every day and live at Dartmouth for three years and eight months, remaining a student until the age of twenty. Approximately three-quarters of British naval officers of the rank of colonel and above are graduates of Dartmouth. There have been slight changes recently; the Admiralty now selects one hundred seventeen-year-old students from various public schools as students each year, but the conservatism of the naval officer school remains.

The problems faced by the British Navy are different from those of other countries. The navies of other countries only need to protect one country, while the British Navy must protect almost half the globe. Its warships cannot be far from naval ports. British naval strategy focuses on concentrating the majority of warships in areas of dangerous weather to respond effectively. British warships are constructed to be able to operate anywhere in the world. While the combat power of each ship may not be as great as that of any other country, they often prevail through numerical superiority.

British general policy is often economics-oriented, and in peacetime, it is unwilling to easily increase the burden on the people by expanding the army and navy to enhance national prestige. It was not until 1935, after Italy annexed Abyssinia, that it awoke and rushed to build warships. Currently under construction are at least five aircraft carriers, hundreds of destroyers and light cruisers, and nine battleships, including five of 35,000 tons and four of 40,000 tons, each equipped with 14-inch and 16-inch guns. In addition, two more battleships have also been ordered.

As for German warships, they have historically aimed at guerrilla warfare. In the last European war, they sank 246 British warships and 815 auxiliary ships. Merchant ships were sunk at an average of 60 ships (250,000 tons) per month. The most famous at the time was the light cruiser Emden, which, under the command of the late Admiral Spee, attacked British commerce in the Indian Ocean with great success, bringing British shipping, especially in the Bay of Bengal, to a complete standstill. In addition, during the last European war, approximately ten armed cargo ships disguised as merchant ships attacked the shipping of the Allied powers. Only two completed their missions and returned home safely. One famous ship was the "Wolf," which slipped out of the Kiel naval port in 1916 and roamed the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans for fifteen months. The Allied warships were helpless, making it the most mysterious and unpredictable adventure in modern history. In this European war, Germany is still using the same strategy to counter the superior navies of Britain and France. However, the biggest problem with this kind of naval guerrilla warfare is the supply of fuel and food. The German naval authorities must have a precise plan for this matter, but how long it can be sustained remains to be proven. – A glimpse of the British Fleet from American Life and Reader's Digest magazines.

### German Aircraft Active at Sea; Two British Ships Sunk; Fierce Air Battle Between British and German Air Forces Over North Sea; German Aircraft Flying to British East Coast Repulsed

London: As a result of German air attacks yesterday, the British merchant ships "Oakland" (1,895 tons) and "Upminster" (1,013 tons) were sunk. "Northburn" (1,146 tons) was also attacked. The number of casualties on the "Oakland" is not yet known, but it is believed that 20 crew members have landed. The "Upminster" was attacked in the North Sea, and the captain and two sailors are feared dead. Ten of the thirteen crew members survived, including two seriously injured. They landed at a port on the east coast last night. The ship's second mate was also among the survivors and described the situation of the attack by two German planes: "The German planes swooped down, first with machine guns, then with bombs, frequently attacking us. The ship was not equipped with cannons or wireless." Other survivors also said that when they fled to the lifeboats, the German planes swooped down on the deck and strafed with machine guns, and when the lifeboats rowed away, they were attacked again. The "Northburn" was attacked by two bombers off the east coast. According to the crew, the German planes dropped no fewer than 40 bombs on the ship, but all missed. They then strafed with machine guns, but no one on board was hit. It is reported that one German plane was hit near the wing by a Lewis machine gun on the "Northburn," and both planes flew away. It is also reported that the Danish ships "Ivan Frotrup" (2,396 tons) and "Ferdie" (955 tons), which were previously reported sunk by German planes, are still floating and can hopefully be towed into port. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)

London: A squadron of British aircraft flew into the North Sea yesterday for reconnaissance and encountered several German long-range fighters, resulting in a chase battle lasting half an hour. According to the Air Ministry, a Messerschmitt Bf 110 German aircraft was seen crashing into the sea, and another German aircraft was forced to land in Denmark. One British aircraft was lost, but the remaining British aircraft continued their eastward reconnaissance after repelling the enemy aircraft and safely returned. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)

Copenhagen: The German aircraft that was forced to land in Toender last night is reportedly unrelated to the battle between the British squadron and German Messerschmitt aircraft over the North Sea yesterday. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)

London: When German aircraft flew over the coast near Newcastle today, anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, and British fighter patrols also scrambled to intercept. The German aircraft immediately flew out to sea without dropping bombs, but one house was slightly damaged by shrapnel from anti-aircraft shells. No alarm was sounded at the time. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)

London: According to news from London this morning, the rumors that the British Air Force had repeatedly carried out daytime air raids on the island of Heligoland are completely unfounded. Officials stated that the British Air Force's air raid on the Heligoland area, as reported in last night's communique, took place at night. British aircraft dropped bombs near the island of Heligoland yesterday morning, but the results are still difficult to determine. As for the report that the Hindenburgdamm was bombed, it has not yet been confirmed. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)

### German Warships Cruising Near the Equator, Waiting to Escort German Merchant Ships Carrying Goods from Brazil Back to Germany

New York: According to a dispatch from the "New York Times" correspondent in the capital of Brazil, several German warships are currently cruising near the equator, presumably waiting to escort German merchant ships departing from Brazilian ports. It is reported that seven German ships have received final departure notices, all fully loaded with coffee, cotton, iron ore, tobacco, and beef, preparing to sail away. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)

### US Decides Not to Detain Crew Members of Self-Sunk German Mail Ship

New York: The United States has decided not to detain the crew members of the German mail ship "Columbus" (32,565 tons), which has already been scuttled. Preparations have now been completed to send 400 crew members of military age back to Germany via San Francisco, Japan, and Siberia. Approximately 150 people of non-military age will be temporarily detained on Ellis Island, waiting to board neutral ships to cross the Atlantic and return to their country. The "Columbus" was the third largest German merchant ship. On December 19, to avoid encountering or being captured by Allied warships outside neutral waters, it was scuttled off Cape Henry, Virginia, USA. The crew was rescued by the US destroyer "Tuscaloosa." (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)

### France Reaffirms Determination to Fight to the End; Peace Can Only Be Discussed After Restoring Trust; Herriot Speaks in the Chamber of Deputies

Paris: The Chamber of Deputies continued its meeting this afternoon. Speaker Herriot, representing the newly elected Presidium, delivered a speech reaffirming the determination to fight to the end. His words were as follows: "That ridiculous dictator, who is attempting to relive the dreams of Frederick II and Peter the Great, is actually accusing us of being imperialists. Isn't that ridiculous? The goals of Britain and France in this war, as US President Roosevelt said on the 3rd of this month, are to uphold freedom, conscience, moral laws, and the most progressive political systems of mankind, namely democracy. However, war has not yet occurred on French territory, thanks to the strength of the British and French armies and the expeditionary forces of the British Empire's autonomous territories. We must still strengthen our rear defenses, just as we have strengthened our front-line defenses, because the enemy is currently working to alienate our country's rear populace. We must guard against this and prevent all enemy propaganda from entering the country. As for our country's peace goals, they are nothing more than the following: (1) To stabilize the international situation, (2) To establish international law based on past lessons, (3) To ensure that all countries can meet their legitimate needs in the future through normal and peaceful means, (4) To revive moral concepts and ensure that the world recognizes that there can be no true civilization without respecting promises. In short, international law must be based on moral laws and supplemented by appropriate security systems to be effective. As for the war between Finland and the Soviet Union, the Finnish nation is currently fighting bravely. The country's victory is in fact a victory of spirit over matter, a victory of human values over violence. Therefore, whether for moral or for practical reasons, we must do everything we can to help them." (Havas dispatch of the 11th)

### Head of Soviet Aviation Industry Replaced

Moscow: The People's Commissar of the Soviet Aviation Industry, Kaganovich, has been relieved of his post due to other appointments and replaced by Shakhalin. At the same time, Yakovlev and Fanlonin were appointed as assistants to Shakhalin to develop the aircraft manufacturing industry. (TASS dispatch of the 10th)

### Britain Begins Conscripting Young Men; Registration is Very Enthusiastic

London: The authorities have begun to call up the first batch of men aged 22 to 23, who registered last December, when there was talk of a new year's call-up. The total number is approximately 240,000, and it will take several weeks to complete the call-up. As for men aged 23 to 27, they are unlikely to be called up for registration until at least March. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)

### British-Soviet Relations Hanging by a Thread; Ambassador Seeds Unlikely to Return to His Post; British Government to Publish White Paper Describing Failure of Trilateral Negotiations

London: The British, French, and Soviet governments conducted negotiations last spring to negotiate a mutual assistance treaty, which was unsuccessful. To clarify the truth to the world, the British government has compiled a White Paper containing various historical materials related to these negotiations, which will be published as soon as Parliament reconvenes on the 16th of this month. (Havas dispatch of the 10th)

London: British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds returned home on leave and arrived here today. Political figures believe that the ambassador is unlikely to return to his post in the future. In his speech yesterday, Prime Minister Chamberlain referred to the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland as an "act of piracy." From this, it can be seen that unless the Soviet Union ceases its aggression against Finland, the current tense situation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union cannot be eased. As for the Soviet Union, according to various sources, it has decided to continue its use of force against Finland, regardless of the consequences. The question is, how long can the current relationship between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union be maintained? It is said that the Soviet Union, due to its unfavorable military situation, is unwilling to openly become hostile to Britain and France, especially since the possibility of reconciliation between Britain, France, and Germany has not yet completely disappeared. The Soviet Union does not want to act rashly and invite trouble. However, some people believe that since there is no room for compromise between Britain and France and Germany, it is possible that Germany and the Soviet Union will eventually form an alliance treaty. As indicated by Soviet official figures here, the Soviet government will "try its best" to maintain neutrality regarding the Western Front war, but the situation would be different if the assistance of Britain and France to Finland is tantamount to open intervention. It can be seen that the country's attitude currently still leaves room for maneuver. As for British officials, although they have said in the past that Britain should assist Finland as much as possible within the scope permitted by neutrality, this kind of reservation is no longer seen today. In other words, it can be asserted that Britain and France will in the future provide substantial assistance to Finland to the extent permitted by their own surplus military strength, without other concerns. As for the methods of assistance, there are only two: one is to sell military supplies to Sweden, and then Sweden will use them to supply Finland; the other is to directly transport military supplies to Finland through the Scandinavian peninsula countries. Although Germany previously threatened Sweden, forcing it to prevent military supplies from being transported to Finland through its territory, it did not succeed. Now that the Swedish government knows that if Germany and the Soviet Union dare to invade, Britain and France will definitely not stand idly by, it will certainly be even less concerned about this kind of threat.

### Another Earthquake in Turkey

Istanbul: Reports from various districts of Anatolia yesterday stated that another major earthquake occurred. The tremors were severe in Burdur, Isparta, Samsun, and Gemerek. The extent of the damage is not yet known. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 11th)

Istanbul: According to an official statement issued today by the Turkish Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Health, the Turkish earthquake has resulted in 25,000 deaths and 8,000 injuries. 3,000 buildings have been destroyed. (United Press International dispatch of the 11th)

### Large Soviet Army Assembled on Northeastern Finnish Front; To Attack Finnish Positions Again

London: Finnish sources in London claim that a large Soviet army has assembled in the areas of Salla and Lake Kiantajärvi, in astonishing numbers, and is expected to attack Finnish positions again soon. According to recent Finnish communiques, the Karelian Isthmus was relatively calm yesterday, with only artillery and patrol activities. It is reported that the Soviet army is still strengthening its defenses. Finnish troops on the Suomussalmi front have advanced to the border, clearing the Soviet army from the area. This is the fourth location where Soviet troops have been driven back into Soviet territory after crossing the border. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)

Helsinki: The Soviet army began an offensive near Ruhtinaansaari on the 9th, and the fighting north of Lake Ladoga has intensified. According to Finnish sources, the Soviet army has a large number of reinforcements, attempting to compensate for the defeat in the Suomussalmi area. According to military observers, the Soviet army on the Karelian front is digging trenches and consolidating its positions. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 11th)

Moscow: According to a communique issued by the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, there were no significant developments on the front yesterday, except for artillery fire and reconnaissance activities in some areas. At the same time, due to inclement weather, the Soviet Air Force only conducted reconnaissance flights. (TASS dispatch of the 11th)

Brussels: Belgian military expert General Balthazar, who went to Finland last April to assist the Finnish government in building fortifications on the Karelian Isthmus, has returned here and praised the Finnish army's bravery and skill. As for the Finnish defenses, new-style bunkers have been built everywhere, making it impossible to cross the line. In addition, the Mannerheim Line is densely covered with barbed wire and obstacles. When the enemy attacks, the Finnish army fires machine guns when they approach within 200 meters, causing heavy casualties and making it impossible for the enemy to advance. (Havas dispatch of the 10th)

### Britain and France to Order 10,000 Military Aircraft from US in Next 18 Months; To Achieve Absolute Air Superiority Over German Air Force; US Aircraft Production Now at Peak

Washington: Allied procurement officials in the US are currently discussing aircraft orders for delivery in 1940 and 1941. Therefore, it is expected that US-made aircraft, especially bombers, will fly across the Atlantic to Britain and France in large numbers, far exceeding Germany's claimed air superiority. It is reported that Allied procurement officials have stated to the US aviation industry that at least 10,000 more US aircraft must be obtained in the next 18 months. Although US officials have not made any comments, it is reported that the aviation industry believes that the number of 10,000 is quite accurate. Britain and France have currently ordered 2,010 warplanes and may order another 3,300 this year. This is approximately the limit of the US manufacturing capacity. However, in early 1941, US manufacturers will definitely be able to supply the Allies with 1,000 aircraft per month. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)

### Italy Resolves to Back Hungary with All Its Military Strength; Seeking Fair Resolution of All Issues Based on the Spirit of the Venice Talks

Budapest: The "Pesti Lloyd" commented on the Italian-Hungarian talks in Venice, stating, "Italy and Hungary now share weal and woe, and the world knows that Italy is backing Hungary with all its military strength." The newspaper also stated that all issues of major concern to Hungary must be resolved in a fair spirit, but Hungary will choose a time to handle them. This is not only in the interest of Hungary but also in the interest of all of Europe. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)

London: According to a wireless broadcast from Rome to New York received here, Italy has undertaken to provide military support to Hungary in the event that Hungary is threatened by Soviet aggression. At the same time, Hungary has agreed to temporarily shelve its claims to Outer Transylvania, in view of the fact that the threat of communism is of more immediate concern than the Outer Transylvania issue. However, it is believed that if Finland can continue to resist, the threat of communism felt by Hungary will not become acute. Outer Transylvania was formerly part of Hungary and was ceded to Romania after the Great War. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)

Berlin: The German official news agency reports from Budapest that Hungarian officials have categorically denied reports that Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky will soon visit Italy again to continue discussions with Italian political leaders. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)

### German-Dutch Border: Political Kidnapping - According to the Testimony of Two Englishmen, Germany is Preparing a Report

Amsterdam - The secret police, led by Himmler of Germany, are currently drafting a report based on the "shocking testimony" of two Englishmen, Stephens and Best, who were secretly kidnapped on the Dutch-German border on November 8th of last year. This report is intended to respond to the Dutch protests regarding the border kidnapping incident. The content of the report is currently kept secret, but according to Berlin's hints, it contains "shocking events that would horrify the Dutch." It is reported that the two Englishmen are currently residing somewhere in Berlin, in good health, but are still being interrogated. It is understood that the two Englishmen traveled from the Netherlands to Germany in a Dutch car, hoping to contact Germany to explore the possibility of peace talks. However, before they entered the German border, they were kidnapped by the German secret police. At that time, Lieutenant Klopp of the Dutch military intelligence agency, who was traveling with the two Englishmen, was shot and killed by the Germans. Subsequently, a car drove out from the German territory, dragging the Dutch car, along with the driver, the two Englishmen, and the deceased Dutch officer, into the German territory. (Reuters, 11th)

### US Fortification of Guam Arouses Japanese Resentment: This Case Will Become a Focus of Debate in the US Congress

Hong Kong - Tokyo dispatch: A spokesperson for the Ministry of the Navy, in response to an interview with foreign reporters, claimed that the new US naval plan, which aims to increase US naval power by 25%, is being watched by all countries, and Japan is no exception. The United States' intention is clearly to maintain its superior ratio over Japan even after the dissolution of the Washington Treaty. The Japanese navy cannot ignore this. When asked whether Japan would create a new ship plan to counter the US plan if it were passed by the US Congress, the spokesperson replied that if such a situation occurred, Japan would be extremely concerned about the US naval plan, and one could imagine the actions it would take. The British reporter immediately suggested that, in order to avoid an arms race, it would be best for the naval powers to exchange information on shipbuilding with each other. The spokesperson said that the method proposed by the reporter might be effective, but Japan could not exchange such information with other countries. Regarding the US plan to build a 52,000-ton warship, the spokesperson said that this morning's editorial in the Yomiuri Shimbun stated that Japan had automatically decided to open the Yangtze River below Nanjing, but the United States responded by announcing a plan to build a 52,000-ton giant ship. The spokesperson then humorously said that such a huge warship could not enter the Yangtze River. When asked about the exact date for the opening of the Yangtze River, the spokesperson replied that it was not yet possible to determine the exact date. The opening of the Yangtze River would depend on the local situation. When asked whether the date of the opening of the Yangtze River was related to the US attitude, the spokesperson said that the opening of the Yangtze River was a decision made by Japan independently. (11th)

Washington - Vincent, Chairman of the US House Naval Affairs Committee, insisted yesterday that the Navy Department must obtain the approval of the House Naval Affairs Committee before using $4,000,000 to improve the naval facilities on Guam; otherwise, it must not use the funds. Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, stated yesterday at his third appearance before the Naval Affairs Committee that the United States has the legal right to fortify islands in the Pacific under existing treaties. The United States considers the Nine-Power Treaty, which prohibits the fortification of islands in the Pacific, to exist only technically, as the treaty also guarantees China's territorial integrity. Stark continued that Japan took a better chess move than the United States by adding a clause to the Nine-Power Treaty prohibiting the fortification of Guam. He told the House Naval Affairs Committee yesterday that a 25% increase in US naval power cannot guarantee the safety of the United States against a combined attack by the Soviet Union, Japan, Italy, and Germany. The United States must prepare early for a "combined offensive" by the dictatorial countries against the Western Hemisphere. According to the current naval strength, we cannot defend southern Brazil while defending against attacks from both sides of the Pacific; therefore, we may have to temporarily sacrifice southern Brazil. (United Press, 11th)

Washington - Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, delivered a speech yesterday to the House Naval Affairs Committee, stating that the Navy Department plans to request an appropriation of $4 million to improve the dock facilities on Guam in order to gradually establish naval and air bases on the island. It is generally expected that the issue of fortifying Guam will once again become the focus of debate in Congress. Last year, the House of Representatives voted 205 to 168 to reject the Guam fortification proposal. Although members of Congress still have divergent views on this matter, since Japan has continued to exclude US interests in the Far East in the past year, there will likely be fewer members of Congress opposing the fortification of Guam than before. It is generally believed that the government will not propose a special bill for the fortification of the island, but will include the fortification expenses in the budget of the Fourteenth Naval District of the Hawaiian Islands. (Havas, 10th)

Tokyo - Japanese newspapers have reacted strongly to the US naval shipbuilding plan. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun recently published an editorial stating that the US Navy still wants to force Japan to accept the unfair five-to-three ratio and wants to realize a strategy across the Pacific Ocean and control Japanese territorial waters. This is intentionally provocative. "In short, if the United States ignores Japan's peaceful naval plan and still wants to maintain an unreasonable advantage, then Japan will have no choice but to expand its naval power to cope with this threat." (Havas, 11th)

Tokyo - According to a Japanese naval spokesperson, the US Navy's reconsideration of the Guam fortification plan is a very "unbeautiful" attitude. He also said that in the last Congress, the United States abandoned the plan. Currently, the US's new consideration of fortifying Guam is strongly opposed by Japan. The spokesperson further stated, "The recent appointment of former US Naval Commander Black as commander of the Fourteenth Naval District of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii is a sign of the United States strengthening its navy to deal with Japan. It is rumored that the United States may build a 50,000-ton battleship. This matter will not only concern Japan but also other countries." (United Press, 11th)

### National Government Plans to Send a Delegation to Burma

Chongqing - The National Government is currently considering selecting a delegation of 3,000 young men and women to go to Burma in early March of this year, following the suggestion of the recent Burmese goodwill delegation to China. It is reported that the delegation will include women's basketball and volleyball teams, as well as men's and women's theater groups. After arriving in Rangoon, they will have friendly matches with local young men and women. The theater groups will perform Chinese wartime life. Wang Zhengting, President of the Amateur Athletic Federation of the Republic of China, will lead the delegation. The trip will take about a month. The Burmese goodwill delegation also plans to send a similar delegation from Burma to China in the near future. (Reuters, 11th)

Chongqing - The Secretariat of the China-Burma Cultural Association recently received confirmation that since the Burmese delegation returned to their country, the friendship between China and Burma has become even closer. The inaugural meeting of the China-Burma Cultural Association was held in Burma on January 5th, with over 400 people from China, Burma, and Britain gathering together, making it a grand occasion. One president and three vice presidents were elected. The president is U Ba Lwin, and the vice presidents are one each from China, Burma, and Britain, with Li Wenhan representing China. (11th)

### Chinese Military Spokesperson Claims Japanese Casualties Last Year Averaged 40,000 Per Month; Japanese Offensive Goals This Year Have No Possibility of Being Achieved

Chongqing - According to a Chinese military spokesperson today, Chinese troops on the Hunan-Guangdong Railway south of Hubei, after capturing several stations along the line, entered Puchi on Tuesday and fought fiercely with Japanese troops all day. In the fierce fighting, two Chinese military barracks were burned down, and the Japanese troops were severely damaged. From this, it can be seen that it is becoming increasingly difficult for Japanese troops to maintain their position. Although the Chinese troops withdrew from Puchi that evening, fierce fighting continued in the eastern suburbs of Puchi until yesterday. On the Guangdong front, Japanese troops on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway continued to retreat. When retreating, Japanese troops used trucks. Japanese troops in northern Guangdong have been retreating south since the failure of the "Christmas Offensive." The current Japanese front line is north of Longmen and Conghua, that is, on the railway line 86 miles north of Guangzhou. On the Zhongtiao Mountain in Shanxi, the Japanese side launched a new offensive, which is the twelfth offensive by the Japanese troops in that area. However, as of yesterday, the Japanese plan had failed again and was forced to retreat to the northwest of Zhongtiao Mountain. It is reported that the Japanese offensive against Zhongtiao Mountain was launched on January 7th, when they used aircraft and artillery to show their power, but the result was still a failure. According to the Chinese military spokesperson's prediction, even if the Japanese side still has offensive goals in the military this year, there is no possibility of achieving these goals. The Japanese troops advanced at a very high speed in 1937, which decreased sharply in 1938, and there was almost no talk of advancing in 1939. Entering this year, all their offensive goals will become "desirable but unattainable." In the past year, the Japanese side has increased its troops in China by as many as eleven divisions, but the Japanese troops still suffered great defeats in central Hubei, northern Hunan, Zhongtiao Mountain, and northern Guangdong. Also, in the past year, the Japanese side only achieved two victories: the capture of Nanchang and the capture of Nanning. At the same time, in the past year, the Japanese army's monthly casualties were 40,000. The Japanese troops currently in North China, Central China, and South China number no less than one million, all stationed between various points and lines, unable to move. Therefore, in the new offensive after January 1st, the Japanese side can use no more than two or three divisions. As for the Chinese troops, since mid-December last year, they have entered Nanchang three times, Hangzhou once, Taiyuan once, and Guangzhou once. The number of times they have entered smaller cities is even countless. Because the Japanese troops are surrounded by enemies on all sides, they have no choice but to station more troops to maintain the security of the rear transportation. Also, in Yichang, an exhibition of war trophies is currently being held, including an exhibition of war trophies recently captured in the Han River basin. There are no less than 30,000 visitors. (United Press, 11th)

### Commercial Stagnation in Guangzhou City

Guangzhou - Today, all Chinese businesses in the city have ceased operations because shop owners, merchants, and restaurants are not accepting Guangdong provincial banknotes, and the legal tender is now only worth 60% of the Japanese military scrip. In addition, exchange shops are unwilling to accept transactions that exchange Guangdong currency and legal tender for Japanese yen. As a result, the market is becoming increasingly chaotic. If the authorities do not quickly implement remedial measures, the Chinese people will soon be in a very difficult situation, as they will be unable to purchase rice and other daily necessities.

### Japanese Troops Make All-Out Assault on Shaoguan; Three Routes of Japanese Troops Initially Arrive with Fierce Momentum; Chinese Troops Repel Japanese Troops After Reinforcements Arrive

Shantou communication: Since the latter half of last month, Japanese troops have mobilized their forces stationed in Guangdong Province and launched an all-out attack on Shaoguan. The fighting is very fierce. The battle situation is recorded as follows:

Three Routes of Japanese Troops Advance

The Japanese right wing, advancing north from Zengcheng, along the mountainous area of the Zeng River, numbers about 10,000 or more. The Japanese units on this route are the Nemoto, Horikawa, Kubo, Nakamiya, Tamura, and Koyama battalions. Chinese troops in that area are fighting from Longmen and Xinfeng. However, Japanese aircraft are wantonly bombing, forcing the Chinese troops to withdraw. On the 28th, the Japanese troops continued to advance northwest, but their rear was held back by our troops, who attacked them in the middle. The Japanese left wing, advancing north along the Yuehan Railway, on the left bank of the North River, includes the Matsuno, Nakano, Masaki, Hayashi, Ikeda, Ohashi, Sasaki, Ikuta, Yuya, and Kawaguchi units, numbering 30,000, arriving with fierce momentum. Artillery concentrated on firing shells, replacing rifles in the battle. Before dawn on the 28th, they used artillery to cover their crossing of the river, firing 2,000 shells per hour. The Sasaki, Nabeshima, Noguchi, and Matsuki Four Sky Squads (each squad with 1,200 or more men) crossed the right bank of the Beijiang River at Pa Zhukou and advanced towards Lyutianxu. On the 29th, over 1,000 Masaki Cavalry Artillery troops attacked Shatin. Seven hundred cavalry troops raided the Quan Shuikeng north of Shatin, firing 30 cannons fiercely at Da Shuikeng. Chinese troops also counterattacked with artillery. The fierce battle continued until the morning of the 31st and was still raging in Lyutian Da Shuikeng. The central route of the Japanese army, advancing from Conghua north to Wengyuan and Fogang, is the Ushijima, Kakuta, Tsuboi, Kasama, Fukahori, Morinaga, Fukuda, and Matsumoto Yoshida battalions, numbering about 10,000 or more. Chinese troops fought fiercely with the Japanese troops between Yingde and the south of Fogang, encircling each other. On the evening of the 28th, the battle shifted to Lianjiangkou. It was reported that Wengyuan had fallen. On the 29th, the Japanese Ping Tian and Nabeshima mountain combat corps reached the Chaziwei and Shatin areas of Xinfeng and engaged in bloody battles with Chinese troops again. There was also a sky battle north of Liangko圩. The Japanese troops fighting against Chinese troops were the Saga and Ishida units. On the 30th, the Japanese Sasaki, Koga, Noguchi, Masaki, and Nabeshima units attacked Lianjiangkou. At 4 p.m., Sasaki invaded Yingde City and a street battle broke out. On the 31st, in the battle situation in northern Guangdong, the Japanese right wing took a large encirclement, with the vanguard only 40 miles from southern Jiangxi.

Japanese Casualties Exceed 30,000

Since New Year's Day, the elite troops of the Chinese side have rushed from southern Jiangxi to Xinfeng and Longmen, heading straight for the upstream of the Dong River to attack the right wing of the Japanese army. The strongholds lost ten days ago have been recovered one after another. On the same day, the Chinese air force dispatched aircraft to assist in the battle. The Japanese troops who had sneaked into Yingde had already collapsed. The new forces of the Chinese side were sweeping towards Lianjiangkou in a whirlwind. The Japanese troops who had sneaked into Wengyuan County also suffered flank attacks and suffered heavy losses. The war vehicles and war horses abandoned on the mountain paths blocked the roads. On the 2nd, the Japanese army at Lianjiangkou retreated to Guantou and was also attacked on both sides by the Chinese army, breaking through the encirclement and fleeing south. A brigade of the Konoe Division guarded Liangko圩, covering the retreat of the Japanese army. Liangko was besieged by the Chinese army for four days, and the entire brigade was almost wiped out. According to military reconnaissance reports from Xingning, on the 24th of last month, the Japanese right wing adopted a large roundabout tactics, sneaking into Wengyuan via Zengcheng, Conghua, Longmen, and Xinfeng. The area along the way is a dangerous mountainous area, but it has always been taboo by military strategists, because the terrain in northern Guangdong is high in the north and low in the south. The Japanese army's move is equivalent to an uphill attack. In the ten days of fighting, there have been more than 40 battles, large and small, averaging three or four times a day with almost no rest. The Japanese right wing suffered about 4,500 casualties. On the 29th, in the battle on the outskirts of Wengyuan City, the main force of the Japanese army was detained by the Chinese artillery in Meikeng Huilong and could not pass. They changed their attack on Shilongtou and Shanghedong. More than 700 Japanese soldiers died. From the evening of the 31st to the morning of New Year's Day, the artillery of the Chinese side in Meikeng displayed its power. The Japanese army then detoured to Guihu, on the border between Wengyuan and Yingde. At Guantou and near Liulixu, they engaged in mixed battles with the Chinese defending army, repeatedly fighting in blood. The Chinese army never retreated. When reinforcements arrived at the front line one after another, they began to carry out a mopping-up operation from New Year's Day. Niu Bei Ridge Meikeng (between Wengyuan and Xinfeng), Fenshui Ao Zi Etan Baishiao (between Conghua and Zengcheng) and other strongholds were successively recovered. The casualties of the Japanese army this time were at least more than 30,000. Cannons, war vehicles, and military equipment were abandoned all over the road. The number of losses is countless. Therefore, the war situation in Guangdong Province has completely turned into a better situation.

The Miserable Situation of Japanese Aircraft Bombing in Henan Province (Continued) Zheng County, Luoyang, Xinyang, and Nanyang Suffer the Greatest Damage; Remote Rural Villages Are Also Difficult to Avoid Japanese Aircraft Bombing

C. Overview of Henan Province's Passive Air Defense and Air Raid Warning Facilities

(1) Warning Facilities: In Henan Province, Luoyang and Zheng County are larger cities with larger populations. Therefore, in addition to setting up electric and hand-cranked sirens, auxiliary sirens are also set up. Other counties, cities, towns, and villages also have warning equipment such as steel rails and cast bells. In addition, the air observation teams and sentries inside and outside the province are equipped quite tightly. Therefore, when Japanese aircraft attack, they can immediately issue warnings. Even the counties along the Longhai Railway, which are very close to the Japanese defense zone, have never missed a warning. When the alarm is issued, people can take refuge in time.

(2) Evacuation Facilities: Evacuation facilities are the guarantee for people's safety under air raids. The geology of Henan Province is solid and the water level is low. Digging air-raid shelters and air-raid trenches to avoid bombing has been very effective. Following the regulations of the air defense department, we have tried our best to supervise and order the administrative authorities in various places to mobilize members of the protection group and the police to dig widely. A total of 4,231 underground shelters have been completed. Air-raid trenches and wells are scattered throughout the cities, counties, and larger towns in the province. Therefore, since the War of Resistance, although the province has been bombed more than 500 times, the number of casualties has been relatively small.

(3) Protection Situation: In order to cope with Japanese aircraft bombing and reduce all the damage it causes, the protection organization is naturally the top priority. After careful planning and strict supervision by the air defense department, each city and county now has a protection organization. Even larger villages and towns also have protection groups. In the event of an air raid, each member of the protection group can work bravely in the tragic environment under the threat of Japanese aircraft. This is also one of the reasons for reducing damage.

(4) Enriching Firefighting: The brutal acts of Japanese aircraft have recently intensified, and they often drop incendiary bombs on various cities. The air defense department has seen this and has ordered the county governments to organize fire brigades one after another. The fire-fighting equipment of each team is also quite substantial. Currently, although there are incidents of Japanese aircraft dropping incendiary bombs in various parts of Henan Province from time to time, they can be put out in time, and the spread of fires is still rare.

(5) Evacuation Situation: Because the Japanese army has been unable to make military progress in recent years, it has turned to indiscriminately bombing defenseless cities in the rear of the Chinese army. In order to maintain the manpower and material resources for a long-term war of resistance, the Chinese authorities ordered the evacuation of the population and resources of the cities. After separate supervision by the air defense department, the counties of Henan have evacuated within a time limit and have achieved good results. In the future, when Japanese aircraft attack, although the loss of buildings is factually inevitable, it will not be easy to harm the people in the rear. (End)

### French Concession Increases Various Taxes; Land Taxes Are Divided into Three Districts and Collected in Different Grades; Police Taxes Will Increase to 15%; Business Licenses for Freelancers Will Also Be Collected

The North China Daily News reported that the budget for the current fiscal year of the French Concession has increased from 11,988,000 yuan to 16,800,000 yuan. Therefore, it has no choice but to increase revenue through taxes, licenses, and other methods to cope with the situation. The main reason for the budget increase is the low price of legal tender and the high value of imported materials. Therefore, since January 1st of this year, major revisions have been made in tax collection, especially land taxes and licenses for certain businesses and other places. In order to facilitate the collection of land taxes, the French Concession authorities have divided the concession into three districts: (1) From the Bund to Avenue Mentiigny, the land tax remains at 8 per thousand; (2) From Avenue Mentiigny to Avenue du Père Robert and Avenue de la Cathédrale, the land tax is changed to 9 per thousand; (3) The areas west of Avenue du Père Robert and Avenue de la Cathédrale, the land tax is changed to　per thousand. These taxes are still subject to a surtax of 1 per thousand. As for the house tax (commonly known as the police tax), it has increased from 13% to 15%, plus the current surtax of 2%, totaling 17%. The license fees for most commercial venues have also been adjusted. Starting from January 1st, ordinary business licenses for freelancers will also be collected. The license fees for cars and other vehicles have also been increased. Once the current budget is approved, it will be jointly handled with the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement. The defense tax implemented two years ago will continue to be collected as usual.



### Post Office Shooting of Foreign Constable Case – Chinese Constable Accidentally Fires Gun – Chinese Constable Feared Bowbede Would Shoot and Resist Arrest – Preemptive Strike Unexpectedly Injures Foreign Constable

On the 10th at noon, inside the North Suzhou Road Post Office Administration, a dispute arose between the furnace room worker Weng Yongxing and Ma Ade, a worker from the Far East Cleaning Company, over boiling water, leading to a quarrel and physical altercation. This resulted in Foreign Constable 克蘭克, number 23 of the Public Concession Police Department, being shot in the abdomen. He is currently receiving treatment at the Country Hospital. Details have already been reported in the newspapers. Currently, the police department has detained the following two individuals in connection with the shooting: (1) Bowbede, manager of the Far East Cleaning Company, a Ningbo native, age 34; and (2) Shen Zhijing, a Chinese constable from Hebei, number 1289, who entered the post office with the foreign constable at the time, age 37. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police department's lawyer, Qian Juchiu, stated that the incident occurred because the price of coal near the furnace room inside the post office had skyrocketed. Therefore, workers from the Far East Cleaning Company, contracted by the post office to wipe windows and wash floors, were required to boil their own water outside the furnace room, except for the post office's own staff. At that time, Weng Yongxing, the furnace room manager, and seven workers from the cleaning company, including Ma Ade, Lin Youwei, and Wang Jinyu, engaged in a dispute while obtaining hot water, leading to a quarrel and physical altercation. Subsequently, the cleaning company foreman, the defendant Bowbede, arrived with a .25 caliber self-defense pistol licensed by the Public Works Department to question Weng Yongxing. Unexpectedly, a large number of workers inside the post office surrounded him. Bowbede, frightened and fearing violence, drew his .25 caliber pistol and fired a warning shot into the ground. At that moment, Foreign Constable 克蘭克, who was injured, and Chinese Constable Shen Zhijing, number 1289, the defendant,

Heard the alarm and entered to investigate who had fired the gun. They learned it was the defendant Bowbede. They grabbed him. Bowbede, wearing a Western suit, inserted one hand into his coat pocket, intending to hand over the pistol. However, Chinese Constable Shen Zhijing, seeing this and fearing that he would shoot and resist arrest, drew his own .38 caliber pistol and fired a shot at Bowbede's right wrist, accidentally hitting the foreign constable in the abdomen. Dr. 愛特生 from the Country Hospital removed a .38 caliber bullet from the foreign constable's abdomen yesterday afternoon at 8 p.m. and, together with another doctor, is treating him. His life is hopefully saved. The case requests that both Bowbede and Shen be

Temporarily Detained pending further investigation based on whether there are any changes in the injured foreign constable's condition, etc. Presiding Judge Liu Yugui interrogated Bowbede, the manager of the Far East Cleaning Company, and Shen Zhijing, Chinese Constable number 1289. Constable Shen admitted to firing a shot, unexpectedly injuring Foreign Constable 克蘭克 in the abdomen, etc. The court ordered them to be detained and rescheduled the hearing for further investigation.

### Meidi Foreign Firm Warehouse – Six Barrels of Tobacco Leaves Stolen – Value Exceeds 10,000 Yuan – Multiple Suspects Arrested

On the 30th of last month, six barrels of tobacco leaves, valued at 13,184 yuan, were stolen from the Meidi Foreign Firm warehouse at 823 倍開爾 Road in East Shanghai.

### Seventy-Year-Old Man – Chops His Daughter-in-Law

A bizarre case of an old man chopping his daughter-in-law occurred in Dongchang Road, Pudong, the other night.

### Young Woman Suddenly Changes Behavior – Leaves Her Husband – Husband Sues for Cohabitation

Li Rende, a Ningbo native and the young owner of the Li Xinji Copper Shop on Caishi Road in the French Concession (age 26, residing at 1 Lane 762, Lafayette Road), married Xu Jiaodi, a woman from his hometown (age 23 this year), through a matchmaker at an early age. They were initially at peace after their marriage. Unexpectedly, starting around November of last year, Jiaodi suddenly changed her behavior, often going out and wandering around. Li repeatedly advised her, but not only did she refuse to listen, but she became angry out of shame and suddenly left home on the 13th of last month, entrusting lawyer Zhou Liangfu to send a letter demanding 5,400 yuan in alimony.

Her husband is blind and does not work, relying entirely on her labor for their livelihood. The situation is very bleak. With the high cost of everything, how can a meager income support a family?

### Grain – Flour Actually Opens at a High Price of 10 Yuan – Trading Suspended Yesterday Due to Buying and Selling Disputes – Flour Merchants Ultimately Get Their Wish

Yesterday, the spot market for flour was quite high. Although the base price for No. 2 flour was still 9.4 yuan, the sellers were actually offering the "Green Cannon" brand at a peak of 10 yuan. The price of flour selling at 10 yuan per bag is unprecedented, but there has been talk of this on the market for months, that flour would not be traded unless it reached 10 yuan. We were unwilling to publicize it in the newspapers, but now it has become a reality. The price of "Warship" and "Tian Zhu" brands was reduced by 1 jiao, but they still cost 9.9 yuan. Both the northern and southern merchants enthusiastically prepared for the New Year. The combined transactions before and yesterday totaled nearly 100,000 bags. There were also more than 10,000 bags of retail transactions on this street. Since the futures of Japanese-made flour have been heavily speculated on, the market has fluctuated like trading on the stock exchange. Yesterday morning, trading was suspended due to buying and selling disputes and would only resume after the matter was resolved. Furthermore, 4,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Xiamen today, and another 1,000 bags will be shipped to Hong Kong.

Wheat was consistently strong yesterday. Because the seller's price for flour had reached a peak of 10 yuan, the wheat market was also offering prices of 16 yuan beyond the border. However, Chinese factories considered the price too high and were unwilling to release more prices to buy. As a result, it was again presented to the trading bureau. It is reported that one lot of Changzhou wheat warehouse receipts was traded, with the price still at 16 yuan.

Regarding miscellaneous grains and goods, 1,400 bags of beans, 5,300 bean cakes, and 1,556 bags of sesame seeds will be shipped to Xiamen today. Another 1,010 bags of beans and 2,180 bags of raw peanuts will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Rice Market Flat

Recently, the supply from the interior has been steadily flowing out of the Hongkou district. Various goods on the market have gradually become abundant. However, recently, a certain party has been monopolizing the market again, and there have been some problems with transferring goods from that district. Fortunately, the warehouse stocks are already plentiful, and the market is stable. Furthermore, the implementation of subsidized rice sales is imminent, which will inevitably have a slight impact on retail sales in stores. Therefore, the operators are unwilling to do much more. As a result, from morning to noon, the market has been flat. Among the intermediaries, there is no shortage of those holding goods with the intention of finding opportunities, but in the end, the other party's willingness to buy is also uncertain, resulting in few overall transactions, no more than 4,000 to 5,000 bags. As a result, the market prices are similar to those of the previous market.

After the arrival of a new batch of foreign rice, more is expected to arrive soon, and the subsidized sales will begin soon. Local shops on this street have significantly reduced their intake, and demand from rural customers has also weakened. Therefore, after the market opened in the morning, it gradually weakened. High Saigon opened at 36.5 yuan, and high broken rice at 32.8 yuan. However, the orders telegraphed back to the station yesterday stated that No. 2 Saigon required 42.78 yuan, and No. 1 was even more difficult to clear. A parcel of broken rice on the road sold for 34.15 yuan.

### Securities – Bond Market Rally Unabated

The grey market for securities was fiercely contested by bulls and bears yesterday. The environment was bullish, and the bears appeared weak, leading to an expansion of the hedging operations. The bears specifically believed that in the previous two sessions, there would be rumors whenever the dividend payment was approaching, and since there was no need to borrow interest at the moment, they considered the news to be unfounded. The bulls relied on the fact that the semi-annual interest was included in the market price, making it very suitable for investment. Therefore, the trend was to increase rather than decrease. Class E bonds even broke through the 50 yuan mark, and various other bonds also reached their recent high prices. Even if there are changes in the future, it feels easier to rise than to fall. Yesterday morning, trading was quiet, with little difference between buyers and sellers. Most purchases were small, and sales were mostly large. However, the market price was slightly firmer than before. In the afternoon, Jiu Feng covered short positions, and Eleventh and Daqing were bought aggressively. Maotai Lianyi had frequent ins and outs, Jiu Fu had slightly increased long positions, and prices gradually rose again. Class E bonds briefly broke through the 5.10 yuan mark, the most recent new price. As a result, it turned up from 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. The total volume of transactions was about 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock Trading: 50 shares of Bank of China stock were traded at a price of 57 yuan.

The British-owned 别发洋行 of this port decided at yesterday's board meeting to distribute an interim dividend of 0.5 yuan per share (國幣) for the year ending February 29, 1940 on January 23.

Yesterday, the stock market of the Zhongye Public Institute opened in the afternoon with good buying interest. The trends of Shanghai Silver Company shares and Ewo Cotton Mills shares were particularly strong, trading mutually at prices of 15.6 yuan and 31.5 yuan. Rubber shares continued to be very firm.

### Finance Uneven News of Bearish and Bullish Factors, Most Foreign Exchange Observers Remain Cautious

Yesterday in the foreign exchange market, the HSBC listing showed no change. In the grey market for British and American exchange, news reports mentioned interest rates, leading to both bearish and bullish possibilities. One report stated that the British Straits Settlements government had issued prohibitions and restrictions on the import of goods from non-British countries, which would inevitably affect Shanghai's exports. Another report claimed that the Abe cabinet in Japan was destined to fall, making the question of who would succeed him the focus of public speculation. However, because the truth of these reports was unclear, most operators remained cautious, waiting for the situation to clarify. Consequently, the day's fluctuations were narrow, trending first looser and then tighter. The final result was slightly softer than the previous day. The morning started flat, but then hardened due to the Hong Kong Electric Company and exporters selling. Foreign banks absorbed offers at 4/8 90625 and 8.125 yuan. At that time, 4/8 75 and 8.0625 yuan could have been closed out. However, sellers disappeared, and the market gradually returned to flat. At one point, it was difficult to close out U.S. dollars for the current month. Later, Huaxing Bank sold some, stabilizing the situation. Around 11:00 AM, a few scattered settlements occurred, and shortly after, Sassoon also purchased forward contracts. In addition, a certain American bank also had an appetite, so the market reversed and softened. By the close, only 4/8 84375 and 7.96875 yuan were reported. The afternoon situation was even more sluggish, with no changes until the late close. The price remained similar to the afternoon close, resulting in a slight tightening of 0.015625 and 0.03125. The trend for futures was the same as for spot.

It was estimated that the Hong Kong Electric Company sold spot British gold at 4/8 890625 to foreign banks. Subsequently, exporters also sold spot U.S. dollars at 8.125 yuan to Banque Belge pour l'Étranger. At that time, foreign banks' selling prices were soliciting 4/8 875 and 8.0625 yuan.

The Market Was Particularly Quiet in the Afternoon

No Major Fluctuations in the Gold Market

Yesterday, the grey market situation for spot gold showed no activity throughout the day, with minimal fluctuations. This was because the exchange market's changes were narrow, and trading was slow. The situation changed from weak to firm due to the exchange market being first loose and then tight. The initial opening showed a decrease of 8 yuan, to 4,070 yuan. This was because the exchange market reported loosening, and silver shops were selling, along with some cash shops. This pushed the price down to a low of 4,070 yuan. After 11:00 AM, the exchange market softened, and a certain money exchange also bought a significant amount, raising the price to 4,081 yuan. The closing price was 4,080 yuan. In the afternoon, the initial opening was weak because a money exchange lowered the price and sold, and buyers were temporarily waiting. This forced the price down by 10 yuan. Later, a certain silver firm took advantage of the low price to buy over 200 taels for customers, raising the closing price to 4,081 yuan. As a result, the price rose by 3 yuan, and the total trading volume decreased to only 600-700 taels. Silver jewelry remained stable. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.

Spot Gold Rebounds by 3 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (10 taels), the initial opening was that the exchange market hardened, and silver shops came to sell, causing the market to open down 8 yuan. A silver shop sold 10 taels to a securities shop for 4,070 yuan. Shortly after, gold shops took advantage of the low price to buy in, and the exchange market stopped loosening and returned to flat. Soon, a certain money exchange followed suit and bought in, gradually raising the price. A gold shop purchased 20 taels from a securities shop for 4,080 yuan. Subsequently, silver shops and cash shops sold together, and buyers' appetite weakened, causing the price to fall again. A cash shop sold 20 taels to a money exchange for 4,070 yuan. After this, the market was quiet for quite some time. Around 11:30 AM, the exchange market reversed and tightened, triggering a buying wind. A certain money exchange again aggressively bought over 100 taels, raising the price by 10 yuan. Then, a certain silver firm purchased 10 taels from a securities shop for 4,081 yuan. Later, a securities shop sold 20 taels to a money exchange for 4,080 yuan as the noon closing price.

A certain silver firm and money exchange each purchased 10 taels from a money exchange for 4,081 yuan as the late closing price. As a result, the price rebounded by 3 yuan.

### U.S. Dollar Notes Show Only Weakening

Yesterday, foreign currencies were stable. The supply and demand for British and American gold pounds was not strong, and market prices did not change. British and American gold notes initially showed no difference. Transactions gradually increased in the afternoon. Because the pound price was strong, U.S. dollar notes alone declined. The evening price was 12 yuan, 5 jiao, and 6 fen. Hong Kong notes and French franc notes absorbed small amounts, and market prices were slightly firmer. Annam notes were scarce, and market prices were slightly higher. The demand for Japanese gold notes trended smoothly, and market prices were slightly better.

The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association remained at 1 jiao and 5 fen for both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Yarn and Cotton: Actual Sales are Declining, Yarn Prices are Falling Daily

The yarn market continued to decline, and the falling trend intensified. This was because actual demand was too weak, leading to an increase in inventory for domestic merchants. In addition, the amount of yarn released by factories was very large, and payments were due, making it inevitable to clear out inventory. At the same time, exchange rates were at a stable level, further dampening the enthusiasm of speculators. In this situation, it was difficult for long positions to remain stable. Many short positions were being closed out. However, large players such as a certain company were still unwilling to close out their positions, and the market was still developing.

The current yarn market opened in the morning with little activity. Although various parties tried hard to support it and shouted loudly, buyers lacked enthusiasm. 20-count Shuang Ma yarn opened at 723 yuan, down 3.5 yuan from the previous day. Shortly after, there was news that exchange rates continued to rise, but the market remained firm, and efforts to tighten the market did not cease. The price fell slightly to 21 yuan. After support from long positions, it returned to 723 yuan. At this time, transactions were very thin. At the close, the price fell again. According to half-day transaction statistics, 1,335 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn fell by 6 yuan, Tian Nv yarn fell by 6 yuan, and Shuang Di Qiu yarn fell by 7 yuan. Today, 120 pieces of yarn were shipped to Xiamen. The amounts purchased by various groups are listed below: Internal Trade: 1,250 bales; Hong Kong: 220 bales; Xiamen: 30 bales; Fuzhou: 10 bales; Tianjin: 10 bales; Mainland: 5 bales. Total: 1,335 bales.

### Quiet Cotton Market

Trading in native cotton has become quiet. Trading among firms is also less active than in the past. Factory demand has also stagnated, and purchases have been sluggish. In reality, yarn sales have declined, inventories have increased, and the end of the year is approaching, leading to a weaker market sentiment. Arrivals from Northern Jiangsu include 4,476 bales of Tong Hua cotton, and 3,870 bales from Beisha. The current situation for native cotton is listed below: Huo Ji Hua cotton, 162.50 yuan, 180 bales purchased by firms; Huo Ji Hua cotton, 163.00 yuan, 200 bales purchased by firms; Changshu Hua cotton, 171.50 yuan, 100 bales purchased by firms; Bei Tai cotton, 169.50 yuan, 320 bales purchased by firms; Huo Mu Jia cotton, 160.00 yuan, 280 bales purchased by firms; Chong Tong cotton, 163.00 yuan, 175 bales purchased by firms; Huo Ji Hua cotton, 170.50 yuan, 2,000 bales purchased by Tong Yi Factory; Tong Hua cotton, 171.00 yuan, 200 bales purchased by firms; Tong Hua cotton, 172.00 yuan, 180 bales purchased by firms.

Another report: Foreign cotton prices, the New York cotton market opened yesterday morning in a weak state due to selling by overseas cotton merchants. Later, due to purchases by industry peers and some short covering, the market turned firm. The closing price rebounded, and prices rose by 2-3 pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton futures fell by five rupees. Egyptian cotton fell by over twenty pounds. The Liverpool market situation was relatively stable.

Trading in Shanghai's foreign cotton market has been quiet recently. However, there are signs of slight activity because exchange rates have been more stable recently, and industry peers are considering making purchases after a long period of inactivity. Japanese manufacturers have been inactive for a long time. It is generally predicted that they will start purchasing American cotton soon. The following are the mill prices for yesterday's cotton, converted at an exchange rate of 8 yuan per U.S. dollar: 20-count American middling cotton, 138.00 yuan; 20-count American middling low grade, 223.85 yuan; 32-count American cotton, 240.50 yuan; 32-count American middling low grade, 224.50 yuan; 42-count American cotton, 245.00 yuan; 42-count American middling low grade, 236.80 yuan.

### Coal: Indian Coal is in Short Supply, Interbank Lending Rates Rise by Another 5 Yuan

Since the European War, Indian Calcutta bituminous coal has been difficult to obtain due to the long distance and soaring freight costs. Most importers are unwilling to take the risk, so there have been no arrivals in Shanghai for the past few months. The market has been relying on existing inventories. Although various docks in Pudong still have over 20,000 tons of old inventory, the owners are taking advantage of the recent shortage to drive up prices. Yesterday, interbank lending rates rose by another 5 yuan. Lump coal is 130 yuan per ton, and coal dust is 118 yuan. Transactions at the docks are for cash only, and only a few are willing to sell. On this street, Calcutta lump coal is 136 yuan per ton, and coal dust is 124 yuan. Delivered to customers, with transportation costs extra.

### Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Prices Fall, Local Market Remains Stable

Yesterday, the silk market in Japan and the United States continued to weaken. New York's near-term prices fell by one jiao, and long-term prices fell by one jiao. Japanese silk prices fell by 1 jiao and 4 fen each. Chinese silk fell by 1 jiao and 1 fen. Yokohama spot prices fell by 47 yuan, and long-term prices rose by 4 yuan. The local Shanghai silk market showed no signs of rising or falling, because foreign firms were unable to sell. There were continued transactions in Indian Chien Chin silk, priced at 1,820 yuan. Although it should be considered a high price compared to the previous market, overseas silk prices have fallen significantly recently (New York near-term prices have already fallen by over 2 jiao, and Yokohama has fallen by 120 yuan). Observing the trend of the silk market, it is unlikely to fall drastically. However, the market sentiment is weaker at present. In addition, 34 pieces of silk and 53 cases of tea were shipped to Hong Kong today.

### Sugar Market: Chebai Continues to Fall

Yesterday the sugar market remained soft. The association quoted prices. Spot 24 rough white and transit cargo called for the original prices unchanged.

Jianbang offered Quanzhou foreign at 60 packages, 48 yuan, with no transactions.

### Piece Goods: Spring Woolens are Already Being Sought on this Street

Winter woolens, which should be in season, have limited actual sales. This is because the Gregorian calendar year-end has passed, and the Lunar New Year is approaching soon. Therefore, market sales continue to decline. However, the current selling prices of general merchandise have mostly increased. This is because there is concern that future arrivals will be lacking. Thin woolens, broadcloth, serge, Walter cloth, pallace, flannel linen, and rubber cloth, which are needed for spring and summer sales, are mostly being collected by industry peers. At the public tea meeting, only buying was heard, not selling, which shows that woolens are in high demand. It is unprecedented in the woolen industry for spring and summer goods to be bought and sold so early on this street. In addition, 257 pieces of cloth were shipped to Xiamen today, and 13 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Medicinal Materials: White Mustard Seed Arrivals and Inventory are Scarce

White mustard seed originates from Tianjin. Lately, the amount arriving is scarce. Guangzhou merchants purchase frequently. Its momentum is increasing daily. The previous market opened at 35 yuan, but the current market price is 40 yuan. Inventory is thin, so if no more arrives, the outlook is still good.

### Chao Yun Production Not Abundant

Bai Zi, also known as Chao Yun (raw material for small green tangerine peel), had a batch arrive previously and sold for 55 yuan. It was from Shantou. Recently, goods from Fujian arrived, but the quality was lower, so they only sold for 35 yuan. However, oily goods have a high status and production is not abundant, inventory is also scarce in the market and will not be affected by lower prices of goods from Fujian. Therefore, the future market is still stable.

### North-South Goods: Xiang Lotus Seed Expensive

Xiang lotus seed has been scarce recently, and market prices have continued to tighten. Local lake lotus seed has increased by 5 yuan, and the street sells it for 165 yuan. Even ordinary Raozhou lotus seed with lower quality sells for 155 yuan. Lower-grade lake lotus seed is 85 to 80 yuan. White lotus seed arrivals and inventory are both low, and the street sells it for 175 yuan.

### Yue Zhi Number Prices Decreased

Not much gold mountain branch has been arriving recently, the market is weak and loosening. Yesterday, the north city number opened a new ordinary Yuan branch for 107 yuan, old Yuan branches were less than 100 yuan, glutinous rice branches continued to decline, only selling for slightly above 180 yuan.

### Miscellaneous News: Reasons for High Prices in Ningbo

Besides grain and local produce, most other goods are very expensive in Ningbo. For example, inferior white sugar, which was 2 jiao per jin before the war, now costs almost 1 yuan. Other examples include yellow sugar at 6 jiao per jin, yarn (Hero brand) at 9.5 yuan per pound, socks at 6-7 jiao per pair, raw soybean oil at 1.2 yuan per jin, kerosene at 7 jiao per jin, matches at 5 fen per box, solid soap at 2.5 jiao per bar, white paper at 40-50 yuan per ream, and iron nails at 1.4 yuan per pound. These have all increased several times compared to before the war. The reasons for the high prices are twofold: (1) the Zhenhai port is blockaded, making transportation difficult; (2) since Wuhan fell, merchants and residents from the interior have been rerouting to Ningbo, especially those from Chongqing and Kunming, so as soon as goods from Shanghai arrive, they are immediately bought out, and local residents cannot obtain them. Due to these reasons, prices in Ningbo have had to rise. (Tao)

### Employment Situation of Graduates from Colleges and Universities Last Year, 2,700 Were Employed

(Special dispatch from Chongqing) The employment situation of graduates from colleges and universities is crucial to the future of the War of Resistance and national construction, and it is a matter of concern for people across the country. The Ministry of Education, in view of this, had coordinated the service and introduction of graduates from various universities in the 27th year (1938). This year, the Ministry of Education is planning to resolve the issue of graduates from colleges and universities by proceeding per last year’s method, and began planning in April. The plan first involved investigating the departments and approximate number of graduates from schools to be graduating this year, and then requesting the central and local government agencies to indicate the number of university graduates they could accommodate for internships or service in order to coordinate distribution. According to the results, there are a total of 5,276 graduates from colleges and universities nationwide this year. Approximately 1,700 graduates were directly introduced by the Ministry of Education and have obtained service opportunities. Their distribution includes: 1. Ministry of Communications, 2. Ministry of Economic Affairs, 3. Ministry of Military Affairs, 4. Ministry of Military Training, 5. Ministries of Military Affairs and Internal Affairs, 6. Sichuan Provincial Government, 7. Anhui Provincial Government, 8. Fujian Provincial Government, etc.

In addition, the Ministry of Education has also selected dozens of outstanding graduates in literature, law, science, engineering, education, and other disciplines from schools this year and assigned them to serve as secondary school educators in border areas. The Ministry of Education will provide living expenses. Furthermore, the Ministry of Education has decided to send all 300-plus graduates from public colleges and universities in Shanghai to the rear to serve, and private school graduates who are willing to serve in the rear will also be assigned work as usual (the number of private school graduates is estimated to be over 700). The Ministry of Education will provide travel expenses for these students and send them in batches to designated locations to concentrate and await assignment. In summary, 2,700 graduates from colleges and universities in the 28th year (1939) have obtained service opportunities through the Ministry of Education's coordination, which is more than half of the total number of graduates from schools this year. The Ministry of Education is continuing to find ways to introduce and request central ministries and commissions and provincial governments that have not fully employed graduates to employ them as much as possible or provide them with internship opportunities. As for those who have directly obtained work through their schools or found employment on their own, the number is also not small. The Ministry has ordered schools to investigate the number of students who have not yet found employment in detail and provide them with assistance separately after the investigation is completed. It is expected that the employment issue for university graduates this year will be fully resolved.

As a result, the number of applicants has been quite crowded recently.

Recently, in addition to some indoor courses, such as foot sounds, folk dances, etc., which are still taught jointly with the physical education department of Ginling Women's College, many courses adapted to the extraordinary period have been added, and experts have been hired as professors. It is reported that new students and transfer students will still be admitted next semester.

### Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football: Match Schedule Arranged: Three Days Next Month, the 8th, 9th, and 11th: Shanghai Team Selection to Be Discussed Next Week

It is now confirmed that the Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Match will be held on the 8th of next month (the first day of the Lunar New Year). The second match will continue on the 9th (Friday), and the third match will be delayed until the 11th (Sunday). This is because the Yu Garden will add dog racing programs on Saturday afternoons starting in 1940, making it difficult to provide football matches. The Yu Garden stadium on Sundays is only available in the morning, so the third interport match must also experience the flavor of playing football at noon. As for the selection of Shanghai team representatives, according to the usual practice, three trial matches must be held before a decision can be made. Now, due to time constraints, only one can be held. However, the two charity matches held not long ago can also be used as a reference for the selection committee. As for the trial match, it will still be contested by the "Ideal" and "Possible" teams. Once the lineup is determined, a practice match will be held, and the opponents will be the elite players who were not selected for the interport team. The Westerners' Association has scheduled a discussion next Wednesday on all preparations, at which time some important steps can be decided.

### How Do We Organize a "Reading Club"?

— Xin Liang

Currently, due to the soaring price of paper and the high cost of everything, the price of books in Shanghai is also much more expensive than before the war. Buying a magazine costs at least a few cents, and other items such as textbooks and photocopied Western books have all increased several times in price. What methods can we use to spend a small amount of money and read a large number of books, newspapers, and magazines? This question naturally lingers in our minds, and the organization of a "reading club" can be said to have been established under this question.

Three months ago, I first had the motivation to organize a "reading club." Indeed, the results obtained were very satisfactory. At first, only a few of my close friends served as the basic members of the "reading club." After about half a month, the number of members joining gradually increased, and the club's finances were also quite sufficient. At present, we can see a new book every month, and there are also more than ten kinds of magazines. I feel that "reading clubs" are really a necessary organization at present. In Britain, this kind of "reading club" is very common, and there are many members. Therefore, the impact on the cultural and educational circles is also very deep and great. In order to solve the difficulties of life, we must implement "consumer cooperation." Similarly, in order to solve the difficulties of reading, why don't we organize "reading clubs"?

At the beginning, I first wrote a letter-like thing to a few close friends:

"Sir: I am afraid you will not deny the current high price of books in Shanghai. Why don't we quickly organize a 'reading club'? Every month, when you move your salary, we may as well propose five cents or one yuan to join the 'reading club' as a member. After that, we can enjoy the right to read various books, newspapers, and magazines purchased by the club. Do you like reading? If you are happy, then please sign your name at the end. Also, what is your favorite magazine? What books do you most want to read? Here, in order to make it convenient for the club to buy books, I think it is also necessary for everyone to write down their favorite books they want to read."

The result was very good. We all agreed to set aside one yuan per month. As for the magazines purchased, there are currently eleven kinds, including Xifeng, Xifeng Supplement, Yuzhoufeng, Tianxiashi, Millard's Review Weekly, China Review Weekly, T'ien Hsia, China Jiurnal, Readers' Digest, Magazine's Digest, and Parade. The new book for the first month was Lin Yutang's Moments in Peking; the second month was the "Translation Collection" published by Xifeng Society; and this month it has also been scheduled to buy a "Mr. Jekyll" translated by Chuan Donghua, published by Commercial Press.

We also stipulate that magazines are changed every two days, and new books are limited to one week per person. Of course, at the beginning, not every member can have a new book to read. But I hope that we can have enough membership fees to purchase a large number of new books in the near future.

We are all comrades who like to read books, and we all have a common wish: that is, to make full use of our spare time to read books. We don't smoke, we don't play mahjong, we don't dance, and we don't run to theaters. We only hope that our knowledge can advance with the giant wheels of this era, and secretly make life more perfect, thus prompting our thorny society to gradually brighten up!

### Why Charge Make-Up Exam Fees?

— Guo Sheng

To talk about make-up exam fees, we must first talk about make-up exams. The original intention of make-up exams: (1) Although the student's exam score is failing, it is not to the extent that he must repeat the course. Also, because the exam is a test of what has been learned on weekdays, it also contains a component of speculation, so it is specially allowed to try again; (2) If a student did not take the exam due to illness and it is verified to be true, it seems inappropriate to directly order him to repeat the course, so he is ordered to take the exam again. This kind of re-examination is called a "make-up exam." The original intention of make-up exams is like this, and the reasons for charging make-up exam fees are said to be "teachers correct exam papers twice, the school spends energy twice, and loses paper"; some say "make-up exam fees are used to punish students who retake the exam." I do not agree with the first saying at all. The teacher's spirit is to do his best to teach students to achieve the purpose of serving the people. If "one point of spirit, one point of wealth" seems too unreasonable; the school must charge for paper, this is the behavior of a store, which seems impossible for schools to adopt. The second saying is close to "imposing penalties on money," which is the rule for collecting taxes and the reason for the existence of tobacco and alcohol donations, and cannot be used as a reason for make-up exam fees. And the above two reasons cannot explain why a make-up exam fee is required for students who miss the exam due to illness. In short, make-up exam fees are extremely unreasonable.

Make-up exam fees are unreasonable, and the amount charged by each school is extremely excessive. My school's regulations stipulate: "The make-up exam fee is three yuan per course, and those with six or more courses are charged a flat rate of eighteen yuan." From one point of view, this regulation is too excessive; from another point of view, it is similar to "the more you buy, the cheaper it is" in stores, isn't it a joke? And it is a fact that teachers in the school deliberately deduct points because of the make-up exam fee in order to obtain more make-up exam fees.

Although make-up exam fees are so unreasonable, very few universities and middle schools in Shanghai do not stipulate make-up exam fees. Therefore, I hope that the school authorities will abolish this unreasonable regulation. If they do not abolish it, please reduce the amount or provide a regulation for students who did not take the exam due to illness to be exempted from paying, because living expenses have risen abnormally recently, and teachers who take education as their responsibility should not add to the burden of parents.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

Chapter 19: Watching Flowers and Appreciating the Moon, Activities Make a Home; Planting Jade and Conceiving Pearls, Pregnancy Has Skills

Zhu Ai'ren said: "Did that woman have children later?" Tang Huizhen said: "Listen to me! When the doctor examined her body, he thought she was at the point of remarrying her husband, hoping that after remarrying her husband, there would be hope of having children. Who knew that after she knew that she could have children, she went to ask a doctor who was good at artificial insemination to teach him to perform artificial insemination. But she was a widow, and her husband had been dead for three years. Where could she get the sperm from? She said: Please choose a strong man and solicit sperm. I can give him a great reward. But you must not tell him who is going to perform this artificial insemination, and you don't have to tell me what the man's name is. Although I borrowed the seeds from him, I still do it secretly, so as not to cause too much fuss later. The doctor followed the plan and solicited sperm from men. Some refused to waste sperm, and some agreed as expected, and followed her secret conditions. The doctor isolated the man and woman in the hospital and did not allow them to meet, and then performed the operation. The operation was performed three times, and later the widow was actually pregnant. Her abdomen gradually expanded, just like other pregnant women. When the pregnancy was full term, she successfully gave birth in their hospital. But she gave birth to a girl. The widow was a little dissatisfied. She complained to the doctor: What I want is a boy, not a girl. Didn't I tell you this earlier? The doctor smiled bitterly and said: Madam! I have done my best for you. But my research on artificial insemination is a great invention. As for the 'method of choosing men and women,' although there is that kind of theory, it has not yet been invented! Unless you come again, but I can only guarantee the child, but I can't guarantee the son!" Tang Huizhen said, laughing non-stop. Zhu Ai'ren said: "Did she ever repeat the operation to achieve the goal of having a son?" Tang Huizhen said: "I don't know about that! That kind of stubborn woman may have achieved the goal. But the man who borrowed the seeds for the second operation was definitely not the man who borrowed the seeds for the first operation. We don't need to talk about this. In short, whether it is a man or a woman, there is only a mother and no father. This child is certainly not her ex-husband's child, but she has no second husband. Who are the parents of this child? The so-called legal lineal ascendants are only half. But she is a widow and can be free, and no one can interfere with her. It is only human nature for her to want a son because she is childless. As for the child being born, it is not impossible to only have the mother's surname without knowing the father's surname. It's just that I think once this trend starts, it will be carried forward and expanded, and the word 'father' in the dictionary can be eliminated." (226)

### Letter from the Women's Education Center

To the Editor of Essays: I have just read your article "Applying for the Women's Education Center" in your column. Regarding the recruitment of clerks in our center, although there is no intention to slander, there are some discrepancies with the facts. I respectfully submit the following to you:

(1) Our center, in view of the importance of the status of administrative staff in an organization, specially carefully selects true talents. This is based on actual needs, in order to eliminate the common malpractice of introducing relatives and friends.

(2) The regulations stipulate a monthly salary of thirty yuan, providing room and board, and a five-month probation period. Those with excellent results will continue to be hired and issued appointment letters. The original text says that there is no food to eat and no salary to be received until five months later, which is a misunderstanding.

(3) Considering the neglect of abacus and calligraphy in ordinary schools today, our center expected no more than forty or fifty applicants. As a result, there were 114 applicants, divided into two classrooms. The preliminary examination admitted 30 candidates, and the re-examination admitted Deng Jiadi, Shan Defen, Bei Jilan, Li Yunan, and Xu Ru, a total of five candidates. The original text said that there were 150 applicants and that they were divided into three classrooms, which is another misunderstanding.

(4) The abacus exam questions were extremely simple, and the amount had been tried by colleagues in our center in advance, and could be completed in 50 minutes. Abacus is a necessary skill for clerks, and speed is especially important. Due to practical difficulties, the time for collecting the papers was delayed by ten minutes, but there were many good papers. What the original text said is probably because the author is not familiar with this technology.

(5) The general knowledge exam, due to the actual needs, paid special attention to the actual life of modern society, so it cannot be limited to the rigid atomic and molecular formulas and principles. If you prepare with the attitude of generally applying to ordinary schools, you will feel disappointed and fall short.

The above items have not been fully explained. I am enclosing a copy of the brochure and the full set of exam papers for your reference, so as to clarify the truth. With special respect, I wish you well.

### Errol Flynn's History of Struggle

— Shu

Ten Years of Hard Work Before Reputation Was Established: Wife is One-Handed But Very Affectionate

Everyone knows that Errol Flynn, a martial arts actor affiliated with Warner Brothers, is currently the most popular martial arts actor. He is only twenty-six years old this year, but he already has such a reputation.

Humble Origins

He was the youngest son of a miner in South America. In the second month of his birth, his father, Brinkett, passed away from him, but fortunately, his mother was able to barely maintain the family's livelihood by relying on the hard work of her ten fingers. Therefore, before Errol Flynn graduated from middle school, he had already begun to struggle with life. In 1930, Paramount Company recruited a large number of film talents, so he joined Paramount Company in that year. Because he was only seventeen years old at that time, he only did some simple editing work, but he was already very satisfied, because he was confident that it was at least slightly better than the mining life his deceased father had done. After two years, he began to be transferred to work in the screenwriting department. In that year, he spent a lot of effort and actually compiled a script called "Magic Kingdom Spring Dynasty". Later, after the company authorities reviewed it, they also thought it was very satisfactory, so he was soon promoted to consultant of the screenwriting department. In the winter of that year, he guest-starred in two films, "Mu Hreni" and others. As a result, the excellence of his acting skills was beyond general expectations. So the company decided to give him the position of senior actor concurrently. Later, he co-starred with the recently deceased Van Dyke in a martial arts film, "The Bloodbath of the Fuxiang".

Back on the Screen

In the early winter of 1934, he had a small rift with the company and officially separated from Paramount that year. After that, he established a film factory outside Le Cesse, but as a result, he lost a large sum of money in a short period of six months. Therefore, in addition to losing all the money he had accumulated over the years, he also owed more than five thousand gold in debt, so he had to announce the closure of the factory. At that time, Sherman Warner, the owner of Warner Brothers Films, learned that Errol intended to return to the film industry, so he personally asked Errol to join Warner. Errol was forced by the situation, so he resolutely agreed. As a result, he signed a contract for one year and six months, but the weekly salary was set at only 140 US dollars.

Acting Maturity

After joining Warner, before "The Rose War Tide", which he co-starred with Edward Robinson, was completed, he had already fallen in love with Una Xueke, a female employee of the company, and announced their marriage. This bride only had one left hand, but Errol's feelings for her were very affectionate. After that, he successively starred in more than ten martial arts films such as "The Biography of Peter the Great", "Ebao Feng", "New Robin Hood", "The Biography of Heroes", and "Robin Hood". As a result, due to the gradual progress of his acting skills, his reputation soared after the release of "The Biography of Peter the Great". It was not until the release of "The Biography of Heroes" in 1936 that Errol Flynn was recognized by world movie fans as the leader in martial arts films. Lin Shusen, a famous actor who is famous in the opera world for his role as a red actor, was hired by the Xinji Grand Stage this time and is scheduled to officially appear on the stage on the first day of the summer calendar. The contract is for a period of one year. The photo is of "Sweeping the Pine".

### Unofficial Records of Pear Garden

Handsome Man Li Xiangyun and Zang Languang

There are two people in the Beiping opera circle who are very beautiful in their plays. One is the Muslim Li Xiangyun, and the other is Zang Languang, a high-achieving student of Wang Huifang. Both are 24 or 5 years old, and their body shapes and appearances are suitable for singing the flower shirt, and their voices are all pleasant to hear. A few years ago, Li was known as the most handsome man in the north. In the summer of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, I arrived in Ping. One day, my friends Yuan Datong (a famous Ping opera artist in the old capital) and Wang Zishen took a beautiful young man to my residence. Seeing that he was dressed in fashionable clothes and had a heavy air of rouge, I still suspected that he was a rising star in the industry. After Yuan introduced him, I learned that this was the long-famous handsome man Li Xiangyun. A month later, he performed "Farewell My Concubine" at Jixiang Garden in Dong'an Market. I specially asked Yuan to invite me to watch it. When we arrived, we saw an old man with white hair in the next box, who had arrived before us. Seeing that he was over eighty years old, he was still in good spirits. When Li's "Farewell My Concubine" appeared, the old man was in high spirits, sometimes applauding, sometimes talking and laughing. During the sword dance, applause rang out from the audience. (In fact, the swordsmanship was not very good) The old man nodded and smiled, even more proud. At the end of the play, the crowd dispersed, but he was still sitting still. After a while, I saw Xiangyun hastily finish undressing, his face still covered with rouge, and he put on a coat and rushed to the old man, helped him downstairs, and went into the car together. Later, I asked Yuan Datong, and I learned that this old man was Mr. Jiang Han. Jiang was the director of the Beiping Antiquities Preservation Institute and a famous gentleman in Ping City. Xiangyun was his adopted son, and Jiang loved him more than his own son. All the expenses for Xiangyun to hire teachers to learn opera, purchase equipment, and so on were all funded by Jiang. That is, Jiang also regularly reserved two or three boxes and several rows in the main hall for each of Li's performances. Therefore, over the years, the amount of support this old man has given Xiangyun should not be small. (171)

### The Tragic Assassination of Ren Daidai

— Bingbing

Her father was Cantonese, her mother was Filipino; her wandering life was unbearably bleak.

The assassination of the famous dancer Ren Daidai caused a sensation, especially among the dance community. The details of her murder were gruesome: her throat was first strangled, and then she was stabbed multiple times in her lower body, leading to her death. It was truly a tragic sight. For a young woman who sold her beauty to meet such a violent end is truly unfortunate and pitiful.

Ren Daidai was originally from Guangdong. She had been a renowned star dancer in Hong Kong. After coming to Shanghai, she joined the Huierdeng Ballroom in the western part of the city, where she had been working for a year. Daidai was only twenty years old, and her life was extremely desolate. Her father was Cantonese, and her mother was Filipino. Her mother disappeared during Daidai's childhood, making her a mixed-race child of "international love." Her father had also passed away some time ago.

In the recent past, a certain "military personnel" pursued her ardently, but she remained aloof, seemingly unimpressed. However, this is a common occurrence in the pleasure grounds where gold buys smiles. Whether his love turned to hatred and motivated the murder, or whether there were other complex reasons, it is impossible to speculate from the outside. It remains a mystery.

The tragedy occurred in apartment number eleven of building one hundred and nine in Jing'an Villa. Initially, the ballroom noticed her absence for three consecutive days and received no response when they called. Everyone said Ren Daidai was missing. Little did they know that she had already bled to death and returned to the realm of sorrowful ghosts. When the apartment servant entered the room for routine cleaning and discovered the horrific scene, her blood had already dried up, no longer possessing the red and vibrant color of peach blossoms!

### The Swallows' New Song

— Qi Hua

Early singing stars such as Luo Diwanli and Al Jolson are gradually losing audience attention. Even the "King of Bass" Bing Crosby has met the same fate, though he continues to make films. His previous work, "Paris Honeymoon," clearly emphasized comedy. As for "The Swallows' New Song," we cannot deny that it relies on the appeal of Linda Ware. Linda Ware can sing and act, and the abundance of talent in Hollywood is probably the reason why early singers are gradually retiring.

As for the performance of "The Swallows' New Song," the director's weak handling is undeniable. He merely followed the script to present the story, failing to effectively control several important scenes. For example, the hardship of Lai Lei's training of children, the sudden ban by the New York Child Protection Society on the eve of the performance, and the mental turmoil of Lai Lei when Qi Si succeeded were all lightly dismissed. Even several performances failed to use lively camera angles to enhance the musical atmosphere of the time. It is even more regrettable that the Tan Luo Xu Orchestra was not adequately introduced to the audience, only shown in a "distant view."

Bing Crosby and the female lead, Lois Comber, are merely accessories in this play, without anything remarkable.
