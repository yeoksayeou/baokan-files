### The War in Southwestern Guangdong and the Situation in Chongqing Becomes Tense: Japanese Forces Invade Zhongshan, and the Chinese Army Resolutely Resists; Japanese Forces Landing on Hainan Island Are Repelled on All Sides

Chongqing: According to Hua Fang [Chinese side] sources received here today, battles are currently underway in the Zhongshan, Xinhui, Gujing, Matang, Tangjiawan, Xiangzhou, Sanshui, and Nanhai areas in the lower reaches of the West River in southern Guangdong. The motives of the Japanese forces' movements in the southwestern part of Guangzhou are still unclear. Some speculate that the Japanese army intends to advance along the West River towards Wuzhou, cutting off Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. It is also possible that the Japanese operations are limited to attempts to disperse the Chinese mobile units operating in southwestern Guangzhou. According to a foreigner who recently traveled to Guangzhou, Chinese guerrillas are active outside Guangzhou City, while Chinese troops north of Guangzhou are defending Sihua. Last month, about one and a half Japanese divisions withdrew through the Nanning area and were transferred to land on Hainan Island, apparently to clear out the Chinese forces in the island's mountains.

The Japanese forces landed at Tangjiawan and Xiangzhou on March 5, and yesterday another Japanese unit landed at Tiexi (transliteration) southwest of Zhongshan. The Japanese army is now surrounding Zhongshan, but the landing force is mainly a naval unit, with only a small number of army personnel participating. (Reuters dispatch of the 7th)

Editorial

### A Word for the Women's Community

Now that we are on March 8th, for more than 30 years, this day has been called Women's Day every year, a holiday with international universality.

The world situation is turbulent, the country's progress is difficult, society is in a state of anxiety, and the people's livelihood is haggard. In this situation, is it still worthwhile to use any holiday as a timely embellishment? The origins of Women's Day are not the product of leisure and elegance; it does not flourish because of songs and dances and peace, nor does it disappear because of natural disasters and man-made calamities. Even with distant thoughts of humans being as ephemeral as mayflies under the weaving of artillery fire, and displacement and upheaval after the holocaust of war, even those outside the war zone are experiencing tangible and intangible, direct and indirect losses in spirit and in material, and more than anything, are feeling strong threats and shocks. Being without incident today, they certainly have no leisure to rest; then, who has the leisure and composure to make a big show of this day? However, the meaning of this day still undiminished in its brilliance.

The enlightened women's community in Shanghai should not waste this day. Those who take office on this day and promote the meaning of Women's Day should be abundant. Those who take advantage of this holiday to advance the women's movement must be what aspiring women are happy to do. For example, the Women's Community Integrity and Shame Movement Committee issued a statement yesterday, suggesting three meanings to the women's compatriots in Shanghai: first, firmly establish the will to resist the war; second, eliminate illiteracy; and third, strengthen the thrift movement. These are practical and timely actions.

We do not want to tread on the suspicion of embellishment, and we want to make some comments on Women's Day. We would like to briefly describe our ordinary feelings about women in general: the phenomenon of the Chinese women's community today is still difficult to summarize into any kind of outline, or to be seen as the outline to represent the Chinese women's community. The central consciousness has not yet been established, or has its central consciousness but is still in a state of potential growth, undiscovered; at the same time, in terms of organization, methods, or in other various relationships, it is still difficult to make a more universal call, seeking a more effective response. How do we know that this is the case? There is an action, how can we get 100,000, 80,000 or 35,000 women to follow and start it; there is a publication, how can we get 100,000, 80,000 or 35,000 women to read and cherish it; 100,000 or 80,000 is not even universal, let alone difficult to achieve. The women in the inland countryside, who account for the absolute majority of Chinese women, mostly bear the burden of labor, not shirking hardship. Not to mention that they shoulder more than half or more of the heavy responsibilities for the family, but they also make a great contribution to the national economic production cause year after year and for life. However, they are still trapped in the cultural and ideological stage of several centuries ago, and are still isolated from the modern world. Their awareness of social status and the concept of husband and child education are despised by modern and progressive women. Urban women have the opportunity to accept modern culture, and are both immersed in the concept of equality and nurtured by the spirit of freedom. They can break away from the shackles of etiquette and be active, and they can understand the liberation of law and compete for it. However, what percentage of them seek extravagance and enjoyments, and willingly degenerate? What percentage of them recognize life and strive to move forward? Those who can fulfill their duties and responsibilities to the nation, family, and society, although it can be said that they are too numerous to count, how many can there be? All of this does not mean that men are in any way superior to women. To go a step further, the various weaknesses in the phenomenon of the women's community are often compounded in male society. However, there is an obvious difference between them: in this great era, in terms of being static, those who have not been pushed and responded to by the great era and remain the same are more women than men. In terms of being dynamic, those who feel pushed and responded to by the great era and whose past and present are worlds apart are more women than men. Only because there are so many static women and the dynamics of women are so dramatic, we cannot but hope that enlightened men and women will make greater efforts for the women's community in general. The Women's Community Integrity and Shame Movement Committee regards eliminating illiteracy as one of the three urgent needs, because literacy is a tool for enriching material life and spiritual life, and a medium for seeking progress. The weakness in the above-mentioned phenomenon of the women's community is also mainly due to the large number of illiterate people. Therefore, it goes without saying that eliminating illiteracy is an urgent need for the women's community, and enlightened men and women must make urgent efforts. What we cannot refrain from saying is that China is said to have been running girls' schools for more than forty years now, is it not? Are not urban women who are literate and know the meaning of words everywhere? There are also many people who know foreign languages or have received secondary or higher education, are there not? However, the phenomenon of the women's community in Shanghai is even more heartbreaking than in the inland countryside. What is the reason for this? The reasons are extremely complex, and it is difficult to explain in one word, but at least it must be explained that literacy is, of course, an important basic tool, but its nature is only a tool. Tools have no soul, and it depends on the soul of those who wield the tools. While eliminating illiteracy, we must also awaken the soul and enrich it. How to awaken and how to enrich it cannot be fully stated in this short article, so we will just give a few examples: make them know that there is a country above parents, brothers, husbands, and children, and make them know why they must love the country, and how to love the country; make them know that women must respect their equal status, and they must also know that they must cultivate respectable objective conditions and live equal living conditions; make them know the knowledge and ability of life and survival, and also make them know that those who contribute to the nation, society, and family have valuable and meaningful life and survival. We believe that this should go hand in hand with eliminating illiteracy, so it is not just about creating a women's community.

Correction: In yesterday's editorial, the line "The Japanese government will not allow its imminent announcement" should be "The Japanese government will soon announce it." The single character was wrong, and the original meaning was completely lost, so we make this correction.

### British Government States in the House of Commons: Far East Policy Remains Consistent; Compromises with Japan Limited to Shanghai West District Police Affairs; Disposition of Silver Stored in Tianjin Must Obtain Chinese Approval

London - During a meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, a Member of Parliament inquired whether the British authorities' promise to the Japanese government to establish order in Shanghai signified a change in Britain's policy regarding the Sino-Japanese war. Foreign Office Under-Secretary Butler replied in the negative, stating that the British authorities were only targeting gambling dens and similar venues in the western district of Shanghai. Under-Secretary Butler then responded to another MP's inquiry that it was indeed a fact that British export trade to China had declined compared to before. The government had repeatedly negotiated with Japan, demanding the cancellation of restrictions imposed by the Japanese authorities on third-country commerce in North and Central China. Another MP raised the issue of Chinese silver stored in the British Concession in Tianjin, stating that, during negotiations with the Japanese side, whether the government had made it clear that this silver would not be handed over without the consent of the Chinese government. Under-Secretary Butler replied, "The government's goal in this matter is to seek a solution acceptable to all parties involved, and the Chinese government is a crucial party among them." Liberal MP Mendel interjected, saying that it was rumored that this silver was intended to be placed under the joint custody of Britain and Japan, and wondered if this was true. Under-Secretary Butler responded, "Placing this silver under the custody of a neutral country is a possibility, but it can be asserted that it will definitely not be done in the manner described by Mr. Mendel." (Havas, 6th)

London - This morning's "News Chronicle" published an editorial stating that Japan's eagerness to end the China Incident is becoming increasingly apparent, which cannot be said to be completely unrelated to Tokyo's recent actions aimed at improving relations between Japan and the Allied Powers. The British people would be pleased to see the end of the war in China, so that China could be relieved of its suffering, but are not prepared to form a "Munich" in the Far East, pardoning Japan's aggression and selling out China to gain Japan's friendship. Any such concessions would be detrimental to Britain, and even more so to the United States. Nothing could be more damaging to relations between Britain and the United States than accepting Japan's demands and selling out the Chinese people. The newspaper concluded by saying that it was recently rumored that Britain and France were willing to mediate between Nanjing and Chongqing in a timely manner to end the war in China, but this could only be done if Japan was prepared to repair some of the painful wrongs it had inflicted on China and propose terms of reconciliation satisfactory to Commander-in-Chief General Chiang Kai-shek.

### Zhu Jiahua's Observations on the European War

Chongqing - The "Central Daily News" today published an article by Zhu Jiahua, Minister of the Organization Department of the Central Party Headquarters, which was the text of a speech he recently gave at Chongqing University, describing his observations on the European war, stating that the current war could be described as an "armed economic struggle." He then compared the economic strength of the Allied Powers with that of Germany. Zhu believed that Germany's position in terms of manpower this time was superior to its position in the last World War, but in terms of raw material and food supply, and financial resources, the Allied Powers' position was indeed stronger than that of Germany. In order to avoid fighting on two fronts and to obtain economic assistance, Germany is currently making every effort to win the friendship of the Soviet Union, as Germany has realized that a swift and decisive victory is just wishful thinking and difficult to achieve. Hitler's consideration of this point is probably more concerned than ever before. (Reuters, 7th)

### France Will Not Easily Yield Annam

Chongqing - According to today's editorial in the "Commercial Daily" here, France will certainly not hand over Annam to Japan without a bloody battle. As for Japan, it has long coveted Annam, as Haiphong has replaced Hong Kong's position for China since 1938, and the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway has replaced the Yuehan Railway in terms of aid to China. Furthermore, France had originally loaned money to China to build a railway in southern Guangxi to connect with Annam. Since the fall of Nanning, the French have also allowed this loan to be used for the construction of the Yu-Rong Railway. This is the reason why Japan is very dissatisfied with France. Unable to think of a solution, Japan resorted to destroying traffic between China and Annam. Furthermore, Japan's occupation of Nanning for one more day is tantamount to a permanent threat to Annam. Although France is 15,000 miles away, France has an investment of 25,000,000,000 francs in Annam, and at the same time has other various economic relations. In short, France will never give up Annam without a fierce and bloody battle. (United Press, 7th)

### Haiphong Inspection: Japanese Ship Mail Seized; Part Addressed to Germany

Tokyo - The captain of the Japanese ship "Bangkok Maru" recently sent a radio message to the Osaka Shosen Kaisha head office, stating that on Tuesday afternoon, the French navy in Haiphong inspected the mail loaded on the ship in Bangkok and confiscated 88 letters, 22 registered letters, and 4 packages, most of which were addressed to Germany. The Japanese consul protested, but to no avail. The Bangkok Maru is scheduled to arrive in Kobe on the 12th of this month. (Reuters, 7th)

### Japanese House of Representatives: Plenary Session Passes Saito's Expulsion

Tokyo - The plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 7th convened at 2:12 PM. First, the chairman reported on the Export Funds and Export Product Manufacturing Funds Accommodation and Other Compensation Bill, which was immediately approved.

Speaker Oyama announced, "Member Saito, in accordance with Article 96, Paragraph 1, Item 4 of the House Law, has been decided to be expelled." The Saito issue, which arose in the plenary session on February 2nd and lasted for more than a month, was thus resolved. The meeting adjourned at 6:15 PM. (Domei, 7th)

### Tianjin's Surroundings Seem to Show Signs of Flooding Again; Rivers Nearby Suddenly Rise; Authorities Have Taken Preventive Measures

Tianjin - In the past three days, due to the warming weather, the water in the rivers near Tianjin has suddenly risen, so Tianjin's surroundings seem to have the potential for a major flood this spring. According to travelers arriving here from southern Tianjin, the water in the Wei River, Zhang River, and Qi River is now gradually increasing. The reason is that the weather is warming and the river ice is melting. In addition, on the South Canal, the sluice gate at Dongguang Station on the Jinpu Railway was broken by ice floes, causing the canal to be in danger of flooding in the direction of Shuoguang. The authorities here have now taken defensive measures to prevent a repeat of last summer's disaster. The Dredging Bureau has now sent engineering teams to the site of the damaged sluice gate to carry out repairs. According to river conservancy experts here, most of the rivers in southern Tianjin originate in Henan, and the climate in Henan is warmer than in Hebei, so the ice floes are easier to melt. After melting, there is no way to discharge them temporarily, so they flow into the canal in southern Tianjin. The reason why the canal sluice gate was broken by ice floes is precisely because of this. According to the "Yong Bao" here, in the past few days, the water level of the Bai River passing through this place has obviously risen, and later, due to the repair of the canal sluice gate, the water level began to decline. In addition, the engineering team here is now planning to rebuild or repair the dikes that were destroyed by the flood last summer to prevent the recurrence of floods. In addition, a prediction is widely spread among the Chinese here, stating that there will be a greater flood this spring than last summer. (United Press, 7th)

In short, my visits to Italy, Germany, France, and Britain are to gather information about the European political situation to report to President Roosevelt. Therefore, all the information I have already received or will receive will be kept strictly confidential and can only be reported to the President alone." I am scheduled to leave here for London on the morning of the 10th of this month to visit the British authorities, and then return to the country via Rome. (Havas, 7th)

Lausanne - It is rumored here yesterday that President Roosevelt will make a final appeal for world peace. It is said that after receiving the report from Deputy Secretary of State Welles, Roosevelt will appeal for peace to the warring countries in Europe without waiting for Welles to return to the United States. It is heard that Roosevelt will not make any affirmative peace proposals. He will warn the warring countries of the serious consequences of a "real war," and at the same time will suggest that the warring countries maintain the current status quo and not engage in large-scale warfare, so that when the time comes, peace negotiations can begin. (United Press, 7th)

Paris - U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles arrived in Paris last night by train from Lausanne. Preparations for welcoming Welles had been completed last night. The issues Welles discussed with French officials were wide-ranging, including the situation in China, the Pan-American security zone, and France's war aims. Informed sources indicated that Paris is the acting capital of the Polish and Czech governments, and Welles can investigate issues related to Poland and the Czech Republic while he is here. French officials claimed that if Welles expressed willingness, French officials would be prepared to discuss the expiring Franco-Japanese trade agreement and the French-American protest against the Japanese bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway based on the abolition of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty, and will discuss the relations between France and the United States and China and Japan. As for France's war aims, Prime Minister Daladier of France has repeatedly explained them. Informed sources claimed that the war aims of the French military include restoring Poland and the Czech Republic, so that the two countries can obtain complete territorial integrity and independence, establishing a German government that can satisfy France, and enabling the newly established German government to provide France with material and moral guarantees, and respect the treaty rights of large and small countries. France is prepared to recognize the United States' keen interest in post-war reconstruction, but insists that the Allied Powers and Germany are at war, and the war aims of the Allied Powers have priority considerations.

### Britain Detains Thirteen Italian Ships; Friendly Resolution Expected; Britain Still Willing to Continue Trade Agreement Negotiations; Italian Government Awaits British Reply

London - As Rome is considering its next actions, the British authorities have impounded another ten Italian coal ships at the Downs contraband inspection station. A total of sixteen Italian ships have now been detained, totaling approximately 80,000 tons and carrying 100,000 tons of coal. The British Enemy Goods Export Committee met last night and ordered the detention of the coal carried by eight of the nine Italian ships that were then moored in the Downs. The ninth ship has been released because it was confirmed that the ship had sailed on March 1 and was delayed due to engine failure. The committee's decision is intended to detain the coal until the end of the war. To prove that the coal is owned by the Italian side or other neutral countries, it will be returned to the original owner at that time, but if it is owned by Germany, it will be distributed in accordance with the terms of the peace treaty. Italian newspapers have widely reported the detention of Italian coal ships, but without criticism. Newspaper editorials do not mention the matter, and even the headlines are limited to facts. Only the "Italian People's Newspaper" mentions Britain's inflexible attitude. Roman political figures are also unwilling to make definitive criticisms. A Roman official told a Reuters reporter that it was regrettable that the matter had reached this severe point, but the clear trend now is that a friendly solution is expected. According to Reuters' London diplomatic correspondent, Britain's reply to Italy's document is expected to be delivered to Rome within a few days. (Reuters, 7th)

London - Five more Italian ships, carrying German coal back to their country, were guided to Taun Port for inspection by British warships today. Including the previous ones, there are already thirteen. Other Italian ships waiting for inspection in Thiel Port are not included. As for the Italian oil tanker "Loasso", it had already sailed out of Rotterdam in the Netherlands before the British government decided to detain German coal, so the British authorities still released it. (Havas, 7th)

Rome - Authoritative sources here claimed today that relations between Britain and Italy are "extremely difficult" due to the British Navy's blockade of German coal exports to Italy. Informed sources predict that Italy will not take further action before receiving Britain's reply to Italy's protest. British and Italian officials here continued informal negotiations today, but there is little possibility that Britain will change its firm position taken last week. It is widely believed that Britain will explain to Italy that Britain's blockade of Germany will not cause Italy any difficulties, and Britain will be prepared to conclude a trade agreement with Italy, so that Italy can obtain the coal it needs through the agreement. Tensions between Britain and Italy have intensified due to the seizure of eight Italian merchant ships carrying coal from Germany to Italy by British ships in the past two days. (United Press, 7th)

London - The dispute between Britain and Italy over the coal issue has recently been commented on by various newspapers, all stating that although the British government is willing to improve business relations with Italy and maintain the existing political agreement (i.e., the agreement signed on April 16, 1938), its determination to block German exports is unwavering. The "Times" stated, "German export goods must be prevented from going to any country. The British government will definitely clarify this point when responding to Italy's protest, and will declare that Britain only wants to attack German industry, and has absolutely no intention of harming Italian or any other country's industry. Efforts must be made to alleviate the temporary difficulties faced by neutral and non-belligerent countries. In short, Britain is currently at war and is determined to win, so it will not hesitate to take all necessary measures to achieve its goals." The "Daily Telegraph" stated, "Britain has proposed that if Italy sells aircraft, armaments and various machines to Britain, it will accept them. In addition, vegetables produced in Italy, which were previously shipped to Germany to pay part of the coal price, although not needed by Britain, can also be accepted. The total value of all these exports is set at 20 million pounds per year. This plan could have been signed and established at the end of last month, but was ultimately rejected by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. It is still unknown whether a new basis can be found at this moment." (Havas, 7th)

### Danish Report Widely Circulated: Britain and France Actively Aid Finland; Troops Will Be Landed in Northern Europe; Sweden Will Not Allow Foreign Troops to Pass Through

Stockholm - The "Stockholm News" criticized the London "Times" for advocating sending troops to Northern Europe to actively aid Finland, stating today, "Although the major powers have exerted all forms of pressure, Sweden is determined not to allow foreign troops to pass through. Our goal is simply to maintain our neutrality, so we must be able to cope with Western Europe's determination to aid Finland. Our neutral position will not allow us to allow foreign troops to pass through, even if this causes war, it is also reasonable. If we allow foreign troops to pass through, it will provoke retaliation from the other belligerent side. If so, we will not be able to escape the war even if we want to." (United Press, 7th)

### Muslim Pilgrimage to Holy Sites as Grand as in Previous Years; Due to Maritime Supremacy Being in the Hands of Democratic Nations

London: According to a special dispatch from here, the Cairo newspaper Al-Ahram commented yesterday on the Muslim pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, saying that the number of pilgrims this year is still as large as in previous years, and has not decreased due to the war in the world. The reason for this is that maritime supremacy is in the hands of democratic nations, and countries that adhere to Islam are all friends of democratic nations. Since maritime supremacy belongs to democratic nations, there is no danger from German submarines in the East Sea. Even if German submarines occasionally intrude into the East Sea, the ships carrying pilgrims may not be attacked by them. However, the Germans cannot be trusted, and indiscriminate attacks on the innocent are also within expectations. Fortunately, the influence of Britain and France extends throughout the East Sea, and pilgrims can still be safe. Another Cairo newspaper discussed Indian nationalism, stating that four important facts have been discovered: (1) The British government allows complete freedom of speech and assembly to discuss British-Indian relations; (2) Indian national leaders are all loyal supporters of democratic nations and are willing to cooperate with Britain; (3) India wants independence and opposes the aggression and tyranny of totalitarian nations; (4) The Indian people want to resolve the issue of their national status through peaceful negotiations in an atmosphere of good understanding.

### Ancient Chinese Books Streaming into the United States; Dr. Hummel Releases Statement

Washington Air Dispatch: Dr. Arthur Hummel, Director of the Oriental Department of the Library of Congress, spoke yesterday about the import of Chinese books into the United States, stating briefly: Precious Chinese books are now streaming into the United States, including rare and unique editions, treasured manuscripts, and historical and literary works of all kinds. They have been found in the Library of Congress and in university libraries across the country. Thousands of these fine books are being imported into the United States each month, mostly at low prices, and some have even been donated to American libraries, because they do not want them to fall into the hands of the Japanese. For example, the Library of Congress already has 200,000 Chinese books, and the number is increasing daily. Judging from this situation, no matter what changes occur in the country's situation in the coming years, its thought and culture will certainly continue for a long time. The dark ages into which ancient Rome fell after the collapse of the Roman Empire lasted for four centuries; the Far East, China, does not have to worry about anything like that. Moreover, the books in the various national libraries of China have long been safely transported to the United States, and what are now being transported are mostly private collections, most of which originally belonged to famous families and clans in northern China. It is said that ancestors often instructed their children and grandchildren to treasure and protect them forever, so that once they were collected, they were kept secret and not shown to others, and later scholars could not even ask to see them. In the past, if someone wanted to see a rare book, the owner would gladly agree, but only after obtaining the consent of all the members of his family could he get a glimpse of it, which shows how difficult it was. However, because such books were treasured so much, they were not accessible to any scholar, and it is believed that there must be a wealth of treasures in them. Now that they have flowed into the United States, scholars will be given the opportunity to explore this rich source of knowledge, and a large-scale cataloging effort is also awaited.

### British House of Commons Discusses Palestine Issue; Opposition Attacks Land Regulations, MacDonald Explains Government Difficulties; Motion to Censure Government Defeated

London: Opposition members of the British House of Commons proposed a motion to censure the government last night because the government had issued regulations restricting the transfer of land in Palestine from Arabs to non-Arabs, stating that the government had issued regulations governing land transfers without the consent of the League of Nations Council, and that it treated a portion of the residents of Palestine with unfair discrimination, which was regrettable. When moving the motion to censure, the Labour member Noel-Baker said that the opposition party had recognized as early as May of last year that the Colonial Secretary's White Paper was inconsistent with the Palestinian mandate, and that the current land regulations were part of the White Paper policy. The opposition party believes that this regulation is harmful to the interests of both Arabs and Jews. The White Paper did not say that the Arabs had lost land and harbored resentment. The current method of only purchasing surplus land by the Jews and guaranteeing the landless Arabs is also very effective, and not only has the Jews not reduced the land available to the Arabs, but the Jews' business has also greatly benefited the Arabs. The proposed land transfer management regulations violate Britain's obligations and violate the grand principles for which Britain went to war. Liberal Party leader Sinclair said that this regulation is tantamount to abandoning the Jews. The government had promised to consult with the League of Nations Council, and if the Council believed that the White Paper conflicted with the mandate, the government would discuss it with Parliament before implementing the White Paper. Now, if the government proceeds with its policy without requesting a meeting of the League of Nations Council, this is not the way to fulfill its promise. Conservative member Cazalet said that the true hope for permanent cooperation between the Arab and Jewish peoples would be destroyed by this regulation. However, Labour member Stokes, who had recently traveled from Palestine and the Near East, spoke in defense of the government, saying that all politicians, administrative leaders, high commissioners, and ambassadors from Cairo to Baghdad were greatly relieved by the government's plan. Conservative Jewish member Lipson said that the government's proposed measures are indeed regrettable, but if Hitler succeeds, what will become of the home of the Jewish people? Victory cannot be achieved without sacrifice, and he believes that the Jewish people are now willing to make this sacrifice. Colonial Secretary MacDonald rose to give a reply, stating briefly that if there were no policies that could maintain stable peace in Palestine, he would not have wanted to be a person of peace and quiet. The control of land sales is a very important part of the government's obligation to implement the mandate. The government has the same obligations to the Jews as it does to the Arabs. The government encourages the Jews to reside in Palestine, but only to the extent that it does not harm the rights of the Arabs. If this limit is reached, their immigration will be stopped. In the past twenty years, under the strong guidance and protection of Britain, more than 350,000 Jews have settled in Palestine, and wasteland has been turned into cultivated land. The future prosperity should be even greater. There is still plenty of room on the farmland purchased by the Jews to accommodate future Jewish immigrants. What Palestine needs is both the continued residence of the Jews and the economic security of the Arabs. The current land regulations are not a concession to the political pressure on the Arab side. The two peoples, Arab and Jewish, have equal rights, and the government should protect them equally. If the rights of the Arabs are not respected, the home of the Jewish people cannot develop. Only on the basis of mutual recognition of the rights of the two peoples can the peace and progress of Palestine be established. The government has taken this action based on the opinion expressed by the fair and responsible parties that, if these measures are not taken as soon as possible, the purpose of the mandate will not be achieved. Twelve months ago, Palestine was in a state of extreme danger, but now it has improved and enjoyed a tranquility that has not been seen in four years. Hitler is eager for Palestine to be his support, but he is now greatly disappointed. The outbreak of war has had a great impact on the pacification of Palestine. The Arabs understand that Nazi rule in Europe will be a great danger to their free future and the freedom of the Arabian Peninsula, so they have eliminated their hatred of Britain and expressed their complete friendship with Britain, and offered their assistance in the war. At the same time, the Jewish leaders also declared at the beginning of the war that a problem more important than the Palestine problem had arisen, so they unconditionally offered their support to Britain and France. Therefore, he would like to express his gratitude to both the Arab and Jewish peoples for their friendship and assistance on behalf of the government. If the government wants to maintain this harmony in the long term, these land regulations are indeed necessary. The British troops stationed in Palestine were withdrawn after the publication of the White Paper and before the outbreak of the war. As for the landless Arabs, they are the original members of the anti-Jewish agitation. Once a conflict occurs, these people will be the pioneers of the rioters. The government has recently received a warning that, although Palestine is superficially calm, there are still uneasy undercurrents among the Arab people. They doubt that the British government intends to faithfully fulfill its promise to protect the interests of the Arab farmers. If their trust in the British government's promise is now broken, the entire attitude of the Palestinian Arabs will inevitably change, and the withdrawn troops will have to be recalled to repeat their arduous work of restoring order. If riots break out in Palestine, there will be repercussions in Transjordan, Iraq, Arabia, Egypt, and India, and the House of Commons and the League of Nations will accuse the government of misjudging the situation and neglecting its responsibility to maintain peace, order, and progress in Palestine. After MacDonald finished speaking, the government party members cheered greatly and then defeated the motion to censure the government by a vote of 292 to 129. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

### The Issue of Swedish Iron Ore Shipments to Germany; Raised in British House of Commons

London: During the afternoon session of the House of Commons today, Labour MP Shinwell questioned the government about the issue of Swedish iron ore being shipped to Germany, asking whether any steps had been taken to intercept it. First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill immediately replied, "The government is well aware of this matter and its importance, but interception will inevitably cause significant consequences and must be carefully considered." Shinwell then asked, "Although we also understand these difficulties, we do not know whether the government is planning to detain this ore." The First Lord of the Admiralty then replied, "We are carefully considering this issue, but so far, no steps have been taken." At this point, Liberal MP Mander also raised a question, saying that Germany has repeatedly sunk the merchant ships of various neutral countries, and it would be right for our country to retaliate. He asked whether the government had considered this. The First Lord of the Admiralty replied, "All I can tell you is that all of these issues are under consideration by the government."

### British Aviation Budget Presented to Parliament; Symbolic Amount of One Hundred Pounds

London: Aviation Minister Wood recently presented the next year's budget to the House of Commons, with a symbolic amount of one hundred pounds. (Note: Since the beginning of the war, all British budget proposals related to national defense have not announced their exact amounts, but only use symbolic figures to represent them.) He also gave a speech reporting on the achievements of the war and the development of the British Air Force, stating briefly: As of now, British aircraft have penetrated German airspace more than a thousand times. Our fighters have taken off more than two thousand times in French territory. Our destroyers have shot down about forty enemy aircraft along the coast. As for the strength of our air force, when I presented the budget proposal to the House of Commons last year, the number of air force personnel in our home country and overseas territories was less than 100,000. As of today, the number of air force personnel in our home country alone is close to this number. In addition, all parts of the British Empire are now stepping up the training of air force personnel. Once the aviation schools in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are fully effective, they can train 20,000 pilots and 30,000 airmen each year. Since the start of the war, the total mileage flown by the aircraft of our country's coastal defense has been no less than five million miles. They have searched for more than one hundred enemy submarines at sea, attacked more than sixty of them, and escorted more than seven hundred of our own merchant fleets. As for our country's aircraft manufacturing capabilities, they have also been greatly developed. The government has also taken various measures to recruit skilled workers and stockpile necessary materials. New aircraft factories are being established every month. In addition to ordering a large number of aircraft from the United States, we are also establishing factories in the various autonomous territories. The aircraft manufactured in the factories in Canada have recently joined the war. In short, the aircraft manufacturing power of Britain and France is far above that of Germany.

### French Finance Minister Reports on the State of the National Treasury; To the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies

Paris: Finance Minister Reynaud recently attended the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon, reporting on the state of the national treasury and commenting on the various interim legal decrees issued by the government on the 29th of last month, stating briefly that the financial situation of France is very good, although it has been severely shaken by the implementation of the general mobilization order and the expenditure of various military expenses, it is still able to support it. Since January 1 of this year, various domestic expenditures have been adequately met by tax revenues and the issuance of treasury bills. For this reason, the agreement recently concluded between the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of France (the main points of which are (1) to re-evaluate the value of the Bank of France's gold reserves, (2) to transfer gold worth 30 billion francs from the Bank of France to the government in exchange for treasury bills of equal value, and (3) to immediately repay the 20 billion francs that the Ministry of Finance borrowed from the Bank of France before the war, and then to have the Bank of France lend to the Ministry of Finance, the amount of which is still limited to 20 billion francs) is only a precautionary measure and will not be implemented immediately. However, if the international situation suddenly changes, the government may implement it in order to purchase goods from abroad and to meet various domestic expenditures. As for the various interim legal decrees promulgated by the government, various restrictive measures had to be taken in order to balance the supply and demand of foreign currency.

### Turmoil in Peiping: Soaring Prices and Plummeting Currency; Both Chinese and Japanese are Threatened

The *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury*'s Peiping correspondent reports on February 6 that the residents of Peiping are now only talking about two things: the price of all goods and what will happen to the local currency in the future. They rarely talk about anything else. Prices in Peiping continue to rise, and the prices of some goods are much higher than in Shanghai. Flour is one example. Other things, such as the price of coal, are not very expensive, but

the situation in North China

may be much more serious than in Central China, because more important foods are actually scarce in North China, making the economic situation more complicated. There are many different reasons for the lack of food, so it is increasingly difficult for those in power to fully address this problem. The main reasons for the famine here are (1) the floods of last summer, (2) the unstable and plummeting currency, (3) the frequent disruption of traffic with the interior due to the activities of guerrillas, and (4) the large increase in the population of Peiping itself due to the influx of Japanese and refugees from the surrounding villages. The prices of more important items, such as flour, rice, meat, sugar, grains, and vegetables, have all

more than doubled.

As a result, there have been calls for the famine to be caused by speculation and profiteering, but this seems to be too simple an explanation. Merchants who sell daily necessities have not been able to drastically raise prices unless they have fully consulted with each other. However, Chinese small businessmen act independently and do not participate in any joint action. The simple truth is that they do not trust the local currency, and since there is a general shortage of goods and the population is too dense, merchants can charge whatever they want, and merchants who sell more permanent goods, if they can manage it, would rather not

sell their stock at all,

or only sell a small amount to cover daily expenses. This attitude of merchants can be clearly seen in the New Year's market in Liulichang. In the past, Liulichang was crowded with tourists every New Year, but this year it was quite deserted and there was very little trade. The antique market in the Temple of the Fire God on the same street, which is often visited by foreigners here, had even fewer tourists. The vendors were very indifferent to the customers and did not make the familiar "Please take a look" sound that they used to make. In terms of local currency, the vendors charged exorbitant prices, and even in terms of gold yuan,

the prices were also high.

The local Japanese newspapers never look for explanations from the proper perspective. Now they are again uttering empty words, saying that in order to remedy the unfortunate economic situation, two methods must be taken: one is to take the opportunity of the establishment of the Wang Jingwei regime to implement a new currency in North China, and the other is to seize the hateful Tianjin concessions and make others suffer for their mistakes. This is a familiar Japanese trick. Unfortunately, the Japanese have not described in detail how the above methods can create a stable currency and regain public trust. What is quite interesting is that when the economic and financial situation in North China has deteriorated sharply in recent weeks, the tone of the propaganda about the "East Asian New Order" has suddenly become mild. This may be because the instigators believe that

their propaganda should be temporarily eased,

for fear that the prosperity of North China, which had been loudly touted abroad, would be too far removed from the current lamentable reality. What is more, the rising cost of living and the increasing difficulty of earning a living have caused the Chinese masses' dissatisfaction with the Japanese to grow rapidly. This is a very serious problem. The success of the Japanese plan to develop North China is now seriously threatened by the collapse of the economic situation. This collapse was undoubtedly completely unexpected by the Japanese authorities, who had always hoped that the economic development would be successful and that the prosperity of North China would win over the Chinese people. It is not only the Chinese who are suffering from the current difficult situation. The Japanese are also feeling dissatisfied and shocked. The Japanese authorities are making countless

impoverished Japanese,

who, finding it difficult to make a living in their own country, were lured to the mainland by the fictitious stories of the wealth of North China, and brought their meager savings and abandoned their families to come to the mainland, now numbering more than 550,000. But their bright hopes have now proven to be a pipe dream and have been severely hit by the sharp rise in the cost of living. It is true that the Japanese in Peiping can still buy ample amounts of rice and flour from the official Japanese agencies at a relatively low price, but

the losses they have suffered

due to the rise in the price of tea, cigarettes, and transportation are no different from those of the Chinese. Therefore, the dissatisfaction of the Japanese is growing day by day. If the Japanese immigration to China is successful, then Saito Takao and others in Japan will be able to answer the question of what the Japanese people have sacrificed and what they have gained. However, if the economic situation in North China continues to deteriorate, as it is now, then this last remaining benefit that Japan has gained in the China Incident will also disappear.

### Active Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Groups on the Shanghai-Nanjing Line Deal Severe Blows to Japanese and Puppet Forces

Suzhou Dispatch: After the fall of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Yuyao, the people, unable to bear the oppression, rose up in self-defense, inflicting heavy blows on the Japanese army. Initially, they were all under the command of Xiong Jian Dong. After Xiong defected, quite a few people followed him. However, those with some integrity disarmed and left. The only remaining forces were Yang Xiaonan's unit, the 14th Brigade of Xiong's Special Operations Headquarters. Xiong repeatedly tried to win him over, but Yang was determined to remain loyal and resolutely resist the Japanese. He established the Suzhou-Wuxi-Yuyao Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Group, training the people. They fought dozens of major and minor battles with the Japanese and puppet forces. Notable examples include the battle of Lumu in Suzhou in May last year, where they captured 42 puppet soldiers, seized 2 machine guns, 64 rifles, and a large quantity of military supplies. In June, they attacked Huangdai Town in Suzhou, capturing 36 puppet soldiers and seizing 30 rifles and 3 five-colored flags. In the same month, they cooperated with the Jiangnan Anti-Japanese Army to attack Hushuguan in Suzhou at night, inflicting 42 casualties on the Japanese army and capturing 3 Japanese soldiers. In July, they encountered over 500 puppet soldiers in Laoxu City, Changshu, and fought fiercely all day. The puppet army left as many as 72 corpses behind, and they seized 3 Type 38 machine guns and 58 Type 38 rifles. In December, they captured 23 puppet soldiers outside Loumen in Suzhou, seizing 11 rifles. In January of this year, the group cooperated with Luo Guoxi's 2nd Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army to attack Huangdai Town, killing 14 puppet soldiers and seizing a Japanese army colonel's command sword and a large quantity of military supplies. On February 17, they attacked the Japanese army in Tangkou Town, Wuxi, killing one Japanese squad leader and wounding one, and killing one puppet policeman. The group also formed a Loyal and Brave Assassination Squad to carry out assassination missions. In March last year, they wounded Feng Xinzhi, the head of the puppet Greater People's Association, in Gongxiang, Suzhou. In April, they killed Yao Zhian, the puppet provincial government's foreign affairs secretary, on London Road in Suzhou. In the same month, they killed two Japanese officers in Yangyu Lane, Suzhou. In November, they killed Feng Runsheng, the accounting section chief of the puppet provincial government, in Dingxiang Lane, Suzhou, and also killed Inou, the intelligence director of the Japanese Inoue Unit, in Shuyuan Lane. The group also repeatedly blew up railways, posing a serious threat to Japanese military transportation.

### Sichuan Provisional Senate Resolves to Send Sichuan Students Abroad to Study, Allocating One Percent of the Province's Education Funds as Expenses

(Chengdu, 6th) The Sichuan Provisional Senate's Second Plenary Session held its thirteenth meeting on the morning of the 6th at 9:00 AM, passing a resolution to allocate one percent of Sichuan Province's annual education funds to send Sichuan students abroad to study, in order to cultivate talents and prepare for specialized skills. The resolution was sent to the provincial government for implementation. The measures include: (1) Quota: 15 students (but if one percent of Sichuan's education funds exceeds 100,000 yuan in the future, the number will be increased accordingly), including 2 in law, 2 in arts, 1 in commerce, 3 in science, 4 in engineering, and 3 in agriculture; (2) Duration: 3 years; (3) Expenses: Limited to 5,000 yuan per student per year; (4) Recruitment: Conducted by a special examination committee organized by the provincial government; (5) Eligibility: Must be a university graduate.

### Current Situation of Implementing Compulsory Education in Zhejiang Province (1)

(4) Establishing Compulsory Education Investigators: Although there are written reports on the actual situation of compulsory education in various counties of this province, their reliability is questionable. Starting this year, compulsory education investigators will be established. Four qualified unemployed primary school teachers will be appointed and sent to various counties to conduct a comprehensive investigation. During the investigation, the number of short-term elementary school classes established, the number of students attending, and the actual situation of education administration will be carefully recorded as a basis for improvement.

(5) Continuing to Establish Short-Term Elementary School Experiment Classes: The most systematic compulsory education facility in this province is the experimental work. Since the establishment of short-term elementary school experiment classes attached to provincial schools in the fifteenth year, it has never been interrupted. In the twenty-sixth year, more than ten schools were designated. In addition to the various items stipulated in the previous two years, the experiment items also included two-year short-term elementary schools, tutoring private schools, methods for school children's homework during busy farming seasons, surveys of school-age children, inviting social assistance to improve schools, problems of grade retention in short-term elementary schools, problems of continued schooling for graduates of short-term elementary schools, methods of contacting families, and methods of mobile education. In the twenty-seventh year, in addition to some schools whose experimental work from the previous year had not yet been completed, they were ordered to continue the experiment. The remaining schools were allowed to formulate experimental plans based on environmental needs and submit them for approval. This year, schools with less significant experimental results will be temporarily ordered to suspend the experiment. Eight schools have been designated to continue the experiment. New items include research on remedial measures for short-term elementary school children who cannot attend school full-time or part-time due to participation in production work or helping with family work, experimental research on short-term elementary school children's anti-Japanese activities, group activities, extracurricular activities, and out-of-school activities, collection and research on various difficult problems in short-term elementary schools, and research on teaching materials and teaching aids for various subjects.

(6) Establishing Short-Term Elementary School Teacher Training Classes: In order to improve the service efficiency of short-term elementary school teachers and urge them to pay attention to spare-time further study, the establishment of short-term elementary school teacher training classes was planned in the twenty-sixth year. However, due to the fall of the provincial capital and the recent relocation of the provincial government, it was virtually shelved. It was officially established at the beginning of the twenty-seventh year, attached to the original Teacher Training Correspondence Research Department of this office. It is stipulated that the principals and teachers of the short-term elementary school experiment classes attached to provincial schools, the mobile schools run by provinces and counties, and the short-term elementary schools in various counties must all enter this class for further study for a period of one year. The subjects are divided into personal and mental cultivation, teaching and training facilities, rural improvement, and anti-Japanese activities, focusing on practical needs. The aim is to implement strict management methods and consistent objectives, so as to make the promotion of compulsory education more smooth.

B. Matters to be Handled for Compulsory Education After the War

(1) Improving the Treatment of Short-Term Elementary School Principals: According to the standards set by this office, the total annual expenditure for short-term elementary schools is 160 yuan, of which wages account for 80 percent, or 128 yuan. After the war, the living standards in various places have increased day by day. Many short-term elementary school principals have sought other service opportunities. Even those who have not changed their positions have the feeling that "even a clever woman cannot cook without rice." This office had planned to moderately improve the situation in the twenty-sixth year in order to make up for the matter. However, due to the discounted distribution of compulsory education funds allocated by the central government and the province, it has not been realized. When the budget for this year was compiled, a fee of 22.600 yuan was included for improving treatment.

(2) Enriching the Equipment of Short-Term Elementary Schools: According to the standards promulgated by the office, the equipment fees for short-term elementary schools were originally not very high, resulting in incomplete school equipment, teaching aids, books, specimens, etc., which has an impact on the effectiveness of teaching and training. However, due to the outbreak of the war, the situation has not changed, and the established plans for the past years have been difficult to implement. Starting this year, a budget of 45.200 yuan has been re-allocated, with an average of 20 yuan per school for increased equipment fees.

(3) Improving Private School Facilities: According to statistics in the twenty-fifth year, there are 4,879 private schools in this province, with 98,714 students. For active improvement, the investigation and registration of private schools, the identification and training of teachers, and the reform of private school facilities must be carried out simultaneously in order to supplement the deficiencies of school education. The effectiveness of the promotion in various counties over the years has not been obvious. This year, it is planned to formulate and promulgate standards and steps for improving private school facilities for compliance, and it is also planned to allocate 300 yuan to each county for improving private school facilities, so as to facilitate effective implementation.

Now, half of the twenty-eighth year has passed, and the compulsory education implementation items have also been mostly realized one after another. The remaining matters to be handled can be completed in the second semester. As for the centralized training of short-term teachers in the province, etc., due to factual limitations, it is planned to postpone implementation. (End)

### Sino-Western Charity Table Tennis Tournament - The Chinese United Team Representatives Are Selected - Lu Hanjun and Nine Others Are Elected - Chen Linsheng Is Recommended to Serve Concurrently as Team Leader

The Shanghai Table Tennis Federation, in order to accept the request of the International Table Tennis Federation and select representatives of the Chinese United Team to compete against the Western United Team, convened a special executive committee meeting at its office, Room 209 on the second floor of the Bank of China, last night at 7:00 PM. Attendees included Xu Duo, Lu Zhongqiu, Liu Keren, Hu Jiankun, Chen Linsheng, and others. Yu Binqi was present as an observer. Xu Duo was elected as chairman and Hu Jiankun as secretary. First, Yu Binqi reported that the association plans to hold a Sino-Western对抗赛 tournament when the world table tennis players pass through Shanghai, and that the proceeds from the ticket sales, in addition to covering the reception expenses, will be used to relieve refugees. He also reported on the preparations. Next, Chen Linsheng reported on the status of various cup competitions. For example, the Second New Six Cup is about to enter the finals, and the venue is currently being negotiated with Zhongqing by Wu Zhaofeng, a member of the association. The Zongjing Cup is currently being contested, and the arrangement of the International Cup is not perfect, because each team only plays once or twice a month, so the teams are deeply dissatisfied. The Third Jingwu Cup All Shanghai Individual Table Tennis Championship has been launched by Liang Jintang, the entertainment director of the Jingwu Association, and will be filed with the association soon. Yang Yuecai, the principal of Zhonghua Middle School, personally came to the association to request the association to send someone to preside over the Third Middle School Cup because the person in charge, Ding Du, resigned. Also, He Xuchu, the sports director of the Women's Christian Association, has actively promoted women's table tennis in cooperation with the association, and has continued to run the Third Women's Table Tennis Training Class since yesterday. After the report was completed, the issue of the players to attend the Chinese United Team was discussed. After careful consideration by the directors, it was decided to use the five major teams that recently won the Second New Six Cup as the basis, and to use Zhang Ying (Qingyun Middle School), Zhang Liansheng, Wang Changhou (Friendship Association), Deng Xiurong (Yunxin), and Wang Huizhang (Postal Jia) as the five singles representatives. Lu Hanjun, Ji Zongpei (Qingyun Jia), Ouyang Weirong, and Deneng (Guangdong Team) were selected as the four doubles representatives. Chen Linsheng was recommended to be the team leader responsible for presiding over team affairs, and Ouyang Wei was designated as the team captain and Lu Hanjun as the manager, representing the Chinese United Team against the Western United Team. Chen Zheng, a dermatologist renowned for his support of table tennis, was hired as the medical advisor to the Chinese United Team. The uniforms for the entire Chinese United Team have been donated by Yu Binqi, and the selected representatives are requested to submit their sizes to the association within a few days for customization. According to Chen Linsheng of the association, the competition with the name of the Chinese United Team against the Western United Team is an unprecedented event in the history of table tennis. He feels that he is not talented enough, but he has been entrusted with the position of team leader by the gentlemen of the association. He feels the importance of the mission. Fortunately, the team members are all first-class famous players in Shanghai. He hopes that all the athletes will show their consistent spirit and strive for international glory for the Chinese. He also hopes that they will prepare well, so that when the world table tennis players come to Shanghai in the future, they will show their true colors and avenge the shame of being defeated in the previous year.

### Western Forests Defender Injured in Car Accident in Avenue Petain - Collision with French Military Vehicle - May Never Be Seen on the Field Again

Kail, the captain of the British Army Western Forests football team stationed in Shanghai, was seriously injured yesterday (the 6th) shortly after noon when he crashed his motorcycle into a French military truck on Avenue Petain. The French truck, driven by Corporal Seymour, was turning from Guingal Road onto Avenue Petain when it collided with Kail's vehicle. Kail fell to the ground, his left leg broken and the bone exposed. He was rushed to the Guangci Hospital by a French Concession ambulance. He underwent surgery by Dr. Villiot, a surgeon at the hospital, and the procedure went well. However, despite the prompt treatment, the injury is still quite serious and he may never be able to play football again. At the time of the accident, the French military truck was coming from Route Cardinal Mercier and heading to a school on Route de Say Zoong to pick up the children of French military officers and take them home. Kail was riding a motorcycle with a defense force notice number 1955, and was traveling down Avenue Petain towards the French military truck. According to Corporal Seymour, he sought to warn Kail as he approached, but did not even see Kail until the collision. Seymour and the truck were not seriously damaged, but Kail's vehicle was beyond repair. Kail, 29, is a key player for the Western Forests football team, playing right back. He was a Shanghai team player in this year's Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Football Tournament.

### Finance - Minimal Fluctuations in Sterling-Dollar Exchange Rate

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial market for sterling-dollar continued to be mediocre. This was because HSBC bought cheap and sold dear, so the market fluctuations were minimal. Early in the morning, overseas reports of a sudden increase of more than one point in the US-UK exchange rate led to an opening market that was sterling steady and dollar soft, with prices at 4 pence 1.40625 and 6.75 yuan. Subsequently, a Chinese bank sold forward and spot sterling on behalf of a Hong Kong firm, but only HSBC was happy to absorb the cheap currency. Sterling was at its softest, trading at 4 pence 1.5625. At this time, the US dollar was difficult to settle and sell at 6.78125 yuan. Later, Sassoon took the lead in buying, followed by the Japanese Bank, and importers also rushed to settle May forward sterling. Fortunately, HSBC still intended to supply spot at 4 pence 1.125, so the tightness was still slight. Trading decreased at noon, and the situation was stable, which lasted until the noon close, at 4 pence 1.125 and 6.71875 yuan. The afternoon market was quiet, with very little trading, which was rare this year. By the close, prices were similar to the noon close. As a result, sterling was tight by 0.15625, and the US dollar was neither honored nor disgraced. The potential for futures was not much different from spot.

Importers Settle May Forward

Early in the morning, London large terms and near and far terms all increased by 0.125. New York silver remained flat, and London gold was fixed. Exchange rates for sterling against US dollars, Shanghai, and France were all flat. The US dollar rose by 0.125 against sterling, unchanged against Shanghai, and increased by 0.75 against France. The central listed rate remained the same. Banks opened the spot premium in the morning, with sterling at 4 pence 1.40625 and the US dollar at 6.75 yuan. Compared with the previous close, sterling was flat and the US dollar was up by 0.03125. This was due to the rebound in the exchange rate. At the same time, futures opened at the same level as the previous day. After opening, Chase first sold spot US dollars to Yuli at 6.75 yuan. Soon, a Chinese bank suddenly sold on behalf of a Hong Kong firm, and the market was extremely stable. It sold a small amount of spot sterling to HSBC at 4 pence 1.5625, and sold to HSBC and Magaliff this month's sterling at 4 pence 1.40625, and this month's US dollar at 6.75 yuan. At this time, Sassoon wanted to settle because it was cheap, but the selling stopped, and it did not succeed. HSBC announced that the listed rate did not move, and the silver balance tax was announced to be up by 0.01. After that, the Japanese Bank suddenly came to a strong buying, so the market turned slightly tight. It bought spot sterling from HSBC and other foreign banks at 4 pence 1.125. At the same time, Sassoon also settled this month's sterling at 4 pence 1.09375 from foreign banks, and this month's US dollar at 6.6875. At this time, spot US dollars also softened to 6.71875 yuan. Soon, importers also purchased May forward sterling from Holland and Yuli and other banks, with prices all at 4 pence. The buying stopped at noon, and the situation was stable until the noon close, with sterling at 4 pence 1.125, slightly tighter than the morning opening by 0.05625, and the US dollar softer by 0.03125.

The Supply and Demand in the Aftermarket Became More Sluggish

The aftermarket was dull, and there was little news of transactions. Until the close, sterling was still at 4 pence 1.125, and the US dollar was still at 6.71875 yuan. This month's sterling was at 4 pence 1.09375, the US dollar was at 6.6875 yuan, next month's sterling was at 4 pence 0.0625, and the US dollar was at 6.5625 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous day, spot and this month's sterling were slightly tighter by 0.015625, and the US dollar was neither honored nor disgraced. There was no change in next month's sterling and US dollar.

Hong Kong's US Dollar Exchange Market Softens

Hong Kong, 7th (Thursday) - The exchange market opened flat this morning. Spot sterling was unchanged, spot US dollar softened by 0.0625 to 24.1875 yuan, spot Shanghai dollar fell by half a yuan to 357.5 yuan, and spot Japanese yen softened by 0.25 to 102.75 yuan. At 11:10 AM, spot Shanghai dollar rebounded by 1.5 yuan to 359 yuan. The opening at 11:30 AM and 2:30 PM in the afternoon was flat, and there was no honor or disgrace in any of the exchange rates.

Tianjin Exchange Rate Slightly Increases

Tianjin, 7th (Thursday) - The exchange market opened flat this morning. Spot sterling softened by 0.03125 to 1 penny 7.71875, and spot US dollar increased by 0.0625 to 6.0625 yuan. The Yu dollar fell by 1 yuan to 111 yuan (joint note). The black market was up by 0.75 yuan to 100 yuan.

### Fluctuations in Foreign Currencies

Yesterday, the supply and demand for foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, was scarce, and the market situation was stable. The exchange rate for British and American gold notes fluctuated. In the morning, the US dollar note once fell to 14 yuan, 6 jiao, and 2 fen, but in the afternoon it firmly rose to 14 yuan, 6 jiao, and 8 fen. As a result, the British gold note remained at 55 yuan and 1 jiao, and the US dollar note slightly decreased to 14 yuan, 6 jiao, and 6 fen. The demand for Hong Kong dollar notes and French franc notes increased, and the market price was slightly firm. The supply of Cambodian and Philippine peso notes was scarce, and the market price was slightly higher. The Annam piastre market was sluggish, and the market price was weak. Japanese gold notes were slightly popular, with the evening market price at 1 yuan, 2 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The evening market price for Korean yen was 1 yuan, 0 jiao, 2 fen, and 4 li. Yesterday's market prices: the US dollar note fell 1 fen, the Hong Kong dollar note rose 5 li, the French franc note rose 4 li, the Annam piastre fell 3 fen, the Cambodian peso rose 1 jiao, the Philippine peso rose 7 fen, and other currencies remained stable.

### Silver Bars Rise Again, Indian Silver Continues to Rise

A Reuters dispatch from London on the 6th reported that the silver market saw small purchases from India. Supply was limited, and trading was light, resulting in a stable market. The market remained stable after closing. Silver bars for both near and far terms each increased by 1.25. A New York silver dispatch reported that spot silver in the US remained stable. A Bombay silver dispatch reported that the Indian market was firm, and current prices continued to rise by 12 annas, with 50 transactions made.

### Discount Rate Drops Another Eight Yuan, Interbank Lending Rate Also Declines by Three Fen

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts and promissory notes continued to decline sharply. For every thousand yuan, the rate fell sharply from 63 yuan and 7 jiao and a half in the morning to 53 yuan, before rebounding to 57 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, the rate hovered around 57 yuan and a half, before dropping another eight yuan. The interbank lending rate of the Bankers' Association also declined by three fen. Both morning and afternoon markets quoted a rate of 1 jiao and 5 fen.

### Bottom Fishing Abounds, Gold Market Initially Declines, Then Firms

Yesterday's market for cash sycee in the black market initially declined, then firmed. Although there were speculative bulls selling off, ultimately, due to strong demand from Hong Kong banks and general investors with ample funds, buying on dips intensified. Therefore, the result was an increase of 13 yuan compared to the previous day. Nongkai weakened, with the price at 4,765 yuan, a decrease of 17 yuan, due to the stable but slightly softer foreign exchange market and retail investors rushing to sell. Fortunately, a certain gold firm bought in at a low price. At that time, the foreign exchange market suddenly reported tightening, and a certain silversmith and gold firm bought in on behalf of Hong Kong banks, pulling the price up to 4,788 yuan. However, a certain bank and money exchange insisted on selling, and the price gradually declined. Fortunately, a certain silversmith, among others, continued to search for sycee on behalf of Hong Kong banks, so the closing price at noon was still 4,783 yuan. In the afternoon, Hong Kong banks became active again, commissioning a certain money exchange to aggressively buy, and retail selling pressure eased slightly, pushing the price up sharply to 4,797 yuan. Afterwards, buying interest gradually subsided, and the price slightly declined, with the closing price at 4,795 yuan. Trading was slightly more active throughout the day, with approximately 1,600 taels traded. Silver jewelry prices remained stable, and customs gold prices remained unchanged.

Sycee Rises by Thirteen Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (10 taels) initially opened lower by 17 yuan due to the stable yet slightly soft foreign exchange market and many retail sellers, with the opening price at 4,765 yuan as a cash firm sold 10 taels to a silversmith. Shortly thereafter, a certain gold firm aggressively bought on the cheap, recovering 15 yuan in an instant, with the silversmith group selling 20 taels to the gold firm at 4,780 yuan. Subsequently, a certain bank aggressively sold more than 100 taels, pushing the price down again by 7 yuan, selling 50 taels to a certain gold firm at 4,773 yuan. At that time, the foreign exchange market suddenly reported tightening, and a certain silversmith suddenly absorbed sycee on behalf of Hong Kong banks, while securities firms also bought in, driving the price up again by 15 yuan, with the silversmith group conducting 30 taels of matching trades at 4,788 yuan. Thereafter, money exchanges frequently sold, and a certain bank sold again, while buying interest from Hong Kong banks and others subsided, pushing the price down again by 12 yuan, with the silversmith group selling 40 taels to the securities firm at 4,776 yuan. Soon after, buying interest from Hong Kong banks resurfaced, aggressively commissioning gold firms and a certain silversmith to buy, driving the price up by 9 yuan, with the securities firm selling 20 taels to the gold firm at 4,785 yuan. Then, the silversmith group conducted 50 taels of mutual trades at 4,783 yuan as the noon closing price. The afternoon opened 2 yuan higher, with the bank buying 20 taels from the money exchange at 4,785 yuan, and then rising another 3 yuan, with the bank buying another 30 taels from the securities firm at 4,788 yuan. Later, the securities firm continued to sell, pushing the price back down by 5 yuan, with the money exchange selling 10 taels to the silversmith group at 4,783 yuan. At that time, the buying interest of a certain money exchange suddenly intensified, aggressively buying on behalf of Hong Kong banks, and with few sellers, the price rose sharply by 14 yuan, with a certain money exchange buying 50 taels from the silversmith group at 4,797 yuan. Afterwards, buying interest gradually subsided, and a certain bank slightly sold at a high price, pushing the price back down by 4 yuan, with a certain bank selling 30 taels to the securities firm at 4,793 yuan. Subsequently, the money exchange bought 50 taels from the gold firm at 4,795 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price increased by 13 yuan compared to the previous day, with a range of 33 differences. The selling price of cash firms' branded gold was several yuan higher than the sycee price, while the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. Spot gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and few transactions were made.

Jewelry Gold Prices Remain Unchanged

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at silversmiths remained unchanged throughout the day. Da Tong Hang still quoted 485 yuan, and the new Tong Hang price was the same as the previous price, with the buying price reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Securities: Government Bonds Weak, Foreign Stocks Initially Rise, Then Fall

The securities black market trended from sluggish to weak yesterday. The dull situation had not yet changed. Since most people had shifted their speculative interest to other markets, there was no sign of improvement in the trading of government bonds. Many people sold at higher prices to consolidate funds, and the rumors continued, making investors wary of buying due to tight credit and high interest rates. Although the draw for Type B bonds was approaching, there was selling at higher prices. The market was difficult to boost, and the market remained in a state of fluctuation. Xinfu, Lianhe, and Zhuanmai took on the responsibility of the draw of Type B bonds, anticipating an almost certain sharp drop in price afterwards. On the 16th, Zhuanmai sold Type E bonds. On the 20th, they absorbed Type E bonds, and Jiufeng offset throughout the day. Tongkang bought throughout the day, but the market remained depressed. The result was a decrease of five fen to two jiao across the board. The total turnover was about 500,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Change from Previous Day

Unified A 57.10 57.00 57.10 Down 0.05

Unified B 50.40 50.25 50.50 Up 0.10

Unified C 48.50 48.35 48.32 Up 0.10

Unified D 47.35 47.30 47.35 Up 0.05

Unified E 47.85 47.75 47.75 Up 0.20

In stock trading, 40 shares of Ning Shao Company were traded at a price of 8 yuan and 8 jiao and a half.

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's one-week settlement went smoothly. The trend was extremely strong in the afternoon, with buyers competing to purchase, resulting in sharp increases in the prices of various stocks. Steel and Jardine Matheson saw particularly large trading volumes. Near the close, the market was slightly suppressed due to profit-taking. Demand from buyers after the decline was good. Rubber stocks remained stable, with little trading volume due to the lack of sellers and brisk trading in industrial stocks.

London, 6th (Wednesday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debts continued to fall, with both Vickers and Tianjin-Pukou Railway bonds falling by half a pound. The market price for Vickers was 10 pounds and a half, and the price for Tianjin-Pukou Railway was 13 pounds and a half. The rest remained stable for the time being.

London, 6th (Wednesday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices of British Far East company stocks were mixed.

### Yarn, Cotton, and Cotton Yarn: Bulls and Bears Contend Fiercely, Major Players Leaning Towards Shorting, Outsiders Still Bullish

The yarn market is calm, with a stable trend, but most people are still bullish. Given that the exchange rate is hovering, the range of fluctuation in the yarn market is relatively narrow. Observing the market situation, some major players, due to the substantial gains already made, are leaning towards shorting. However, outsiders believe that the exchange rate is difficult to loosen for a long time, and are bullish on yarn prices. Buying pressure surges whenever the market price declines, indicating a fierce contention between bulls and bears.

The opening price of spot yarn this morning was slightly soft. The exchange rate did not change significantly, and market sentiment was normal. The price of 20-count Shuangma in March was 910 yuan, rising slightly to 11 yuan, before gradually declining to 906 yuan. The price lingered for a long time, and then, hearing that the foreign market had slightly shrunk, buying pressure began, rising to 913 yuan at closing. The total trading volume in half a day was 1,680 bales. The market price of 20-count Shuangma was flat, about the same as the previous day. On the 8th, 45 pieces of yarn were shipped to Tianjin and 10 pieces were shipped to Yantai. The amount purchased by various groups is listed below:

Hong Kong 285 Inland 175

Wenzhou 10 Xiamen 10

Traders 1,200 Total 1,680

### Shanghai Stocks Dwindling, Taicang Cotton Sold at 200 Yuan

Cotton trading has become more active. Traders are bullish and have a firm belief in higher prices because stocks are dwindling and there is no hope of an abundant supply from various sources. In fact, stocks have been exhausted in all areas, so while the yarn market rises and falls intermittently, cotton has seen a steady increase. The prices of various types of cotton have increased by one or two yuan. The price of Huoji white packaged cotton has reached 200 yuan. Taicang cotton is being sold at over 200 yuan, and the price of general cotton is approaching 210 yuan. 270 bales of Beisha cotton arrived. There have been no other arrivals. The current situation of spot cotton is listed below:

Huocao packaged cotton 197.00 Traders buy 228 bales

Also 195.50

Also 196.50 Also 960 bales

Also 198.50

Huobai packaged cotton 200.00 Also 152 bales

Tongda packaged cotton 212.00 Also 100 pieces

Xiasha American cotton 215.00 Also 280 bales

Taicang cotton 202.00 Also 200 bales

Tongzhou cotton 208.00 Also 87 bales

Nanxiang cotton 202.00 Also 310 bales

In other news, the market price of foreign cotton: the New York cotton market initially weakened due to the lack of demand in the market, overseas cotton merchants selling in the market, and some bulls liquidating their positions. As a result, the closing price fell by seven or eight pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, increased by two rupees, while Egyptian cotton fell by nine pounds.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading sentiment was exceptionally good yesterday, especially among traders, due to the scarcity of spot goods in the market. As a result, traders actively sought out and purchased cotton from various sources. Factories were less enthusiastic, only purchasing cheaper options. The factory delivery prices for yesterday's cotton market, converted at an exchange rate of 6.6875 yuan per US dollar, are as follows:

20-count American Medium Staple 264.20

Also Lower Grade 253.50

32-count Also 277.00

Also Lower Grade 266.10

42-count Also 281.00

Also Lower Grade 266.20

### Piece Goods: Tight Credit, Hoarded Goods Released

Due to tight credit in the cloth market, money lenders have released hoarded goods in batches. Actual sales are good, and traders continue to absorb them. There are also those who buy on dips, so the market price fluctuates between one and two jiao per piece, presenting a fluctuating situation. This street's spring and summer light-colored goods are gaining momentum, and Lun Chang Ma yarn, Ma textile, and calico were distributed and sold by wholesalers yesterday, totaling over 200 cases. Shirting material, striped plain cotton, and poplin are also selling well. Wholesale of light-colored calico, dyed cloth, bleached cloth, and poplin is most active on Suzhou Creek Road. The Wenzhou group continues to purchase nearly 200 pieces of various goods, mostly Lun Chang Yih Ho products. The Fujian, Guangdong, and Southeast Asian groups also made purchases, but in smaller amounts. On the 8th, 20 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Yantai and 38 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.

Eastern cloth sales were sluggish yesterday, and hoarders, due to continued tight credit and sluggish sentiment, found white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill showing signs of fluctuation. It is heard that factories will increase the warehouse rent for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth stored since last year, charging 10 yuan per piece per month, which is affecting the Longtou market price. Yesterday's closing price was 27 yuan and 1 jiao per piece. Other mid- to low-grade fine cloths also fell by two or three jiao due to weak actual demand.

### Grains: Rice Prices Initially Fall, Then Rebound

Yesterday's rice market saw a sharper decline than before in the morning. Number 1 Saigon initially fell by more than one yuan, to 45 yuan. Other types of rice plunged by two to two and a half yuan. Huojiao sold for as low as 43 yuan, and 42 and a half yuan. Xiaojiao broke the 40-yuan mark, falling to 39 yuan and 5 jiao. Tokyo Cimae tip sold for only 39 yuan. At the beginning of the day, general speculative retail investors, fearful of losses from the previous day's aftermath, sold aggressively as soon as the market opened, causing prices to plummet. Then, the source goods followed suit, causing this sharp decline. The market situation at that time was extremely chaotic, with large price differences, often as much as one yuan. General stores acted as observers, waiting for an opportunity to act. Later, they suddenly took action, buying at low prices, and the market situation immediately became active, with a wide range of sales. In addition, previously inactive inland groups also started to purchase, and the market gradually recovered from weak to tight, with prices gradually rebounding. By the noon closing, over one yuan of the earlier sharp decline had been recovered, but prices were still lower than the previous market by half a yuan to one yuan. The closing price of Number 1 Saigon was 45 and a half yuan, Number 2 was 42 and a half yuan, Huojiao was 44 yuan, Xiaojiao was 41 yuan, Luo Number 2 was 42 and a half yuan, and the highest price for Tokyo Cimae tip was 41 yuan, with the next grade at 40 yuan. Mixed broken rice was firmer than other types of rice, with a fluctuation of only one yuan from beginning to end. The final price was only about half a yuan lower than the earlier price of 45 yuan or 44 and a half yuan. Compared to the morning price of 45 and a half yuan, the noon price of 44 yuan and 7 jiao was about 7 jiao lower.

After the market opened yesterday, bulk sales of foreign rice were hampered by continuous congestion and the expected arrival of 300,000 to 400,000 bags this month. Transactions were difficult, and credit was tight, causing speculative investors to become fearful and rush to sell. Prices fell sharply by 1 yuan and 35 jiao in the morning. However, the price decline immediately attracted interest from domestic merchants, and transactions increased, causing the price to rebound by three or five jiao. There were no new futures transactions, and liquidation was also down nearly a yuan, with Xiaojiao only at 49 yuan, and March Saigon Number 2 and Siam Number 2 both only at 50 yuan and 5 jiao. Yesterday, 1,049 bags were shipped to Tianjin.

The market for glutinous rice was dull, and the sharp decline in foreign rice made it difficult to maintain prices. Prices were further reduced by one yuan, with Liyang special-grade rice selling for only 41 yuan, Danyang rice selling for 39 yuan, and other domestic rice such as thick and thin indica rice and early and late rice being scarce. It is heard that black market trading was also unable to open.

### Flour and Wheat Weaken

The flour market is depressed. The transactions on this street involve both flat-price flour distribution, and most stores are no longer retailing it. So domestic sales are difficult to expand, and they are only coming from the interior and rural customers. As for wholesale sales, the export tax exemption for flour issued by the "Tax Bureau" has been suspended, making demand even quieter. However, the domestic wheat supply is currently lacking, and the combined price of foreign wheat must be 30 yuan, so its cost is always high. Therefore, those holding returned cargo are not eager to sell it. It is heard that the price of Green Cannon Carriage and warships must be above 15 yuan, but there are no official buyers. Old Carriage warehouse receipts are 14 yuan and 4 jiao, several fen lower than before. On the 8th, 15,400 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin.

There were a few transactions in the wheat market, including two carts of Suzhou wheat at a price of 24 yuan, half a yuan lower than Tuesday's opening price. There were few transactions for Changshu and other wheat, because the domestic wheat supply has been exhausted, and inventory is low. While foreign exchange rates have stabilized in recent days, foreign wheat, although ordered, has not yet arrived. The holders still intend to defend prices. The market environment is still brewing.

### Oilseed Cake, Raw Soybean Oil Expensive, Users Know to Save - Retail Sales Stagnant -

Because the price of the oil market is too expensive, consumers are saving, resulting in stagnant retail sales. Vendors inevitably lose their footing, so circulating capital gradually fills up. The bean oil market fell again yesterday, with 80 barrels of Dalian crude oil traded at 109 yuan, and 20 barrels of Bengbu bucket oil traded at 107 yuan. Exporters of peanut oil did not make inquiries. Jiaozhou oil fell by three yuan, with 100 pieces traded at 80 yuan. Qingdao bucket oil fell seven yuan from last Saturday, opening at 109 yuan, with 10 barrels traded. All of the above oils were handled by merchants on this street. On the 7th, 900 cans of tung oil arrived from Tianjin.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Dried Mushrooms Soar

Dried mushrooms recently soared in price due to low arrivals. Yesterday, Temple Naturally Grown mushrooms sold for 1,800 yuan, an increase of 500 yuan from the opening price, Inner Eight Banners 1,000 yuan, an increase of 150 yuan, Temple Slices 950 yuan, an increase of 200 yuan. Prices are exceptionally high.

### Spitting Anywhere Will Soon Be Strictly Prohibited

(Special Dispatch) Following "Safety First," a cleanliness campaign will soon follow. The general public often ignores the importance of public health, spitting phlegm indiscriminately. Once dry, it floats in the air with dust, spreading infectious diseases. Phlegm is a symptom of weak lungs. A cold starts with incessant sneezing and sniffling, and prolonged coughing leads to frequent sputum. Severe tuberculosis causes thick, sticky phlegm that is difficult to cough up and endless to spit. According to personal experience, the most effective medicine for resolving phlegm, stopping coughs, and preventing tuberculosis is domestically produced "Liangyuan Baisha Loquat Syrup." It functions to nourish the lungs, strengthen the body, kill bacteria, stop coughs, moisten the throat, and promote saliva production. Regardless of gender, age, or severity of lung cough symptoms, it is effective after taking it. The sweet and palatable taste is a bonus. Signs everywhere say, "No Spitting Allowed." You can now safely ignore those. Company pharmacies, dried goods stores, and tea shops sell it. Beware of inferior products when buying. This syrup is a reputable product of Shanghai Liangyuan Pharmaceutical Factory (Anbang).

### Today is March 8th Women's Day Celebration, Women's Circles Encourage and Inspire Each Other. Diligence Groups Go Out to Promote the Meaning of Integrity, Women's Circles Issue Communiqué to Encourage Each Other

Today is "March 8th" International Women's Day. The Integrity Movement Committee of the women's circle in this city has issued a statement to women compatriots, raising cultural standards, strengthening thrift, resolute will, and advising fathers, brothers, husbands, and friends not to be tempted or shaken. The original text was published in yesterday's newspaper. Today, the association also announced that all members of the subordinate Diligence Groups will mobilize and go out to the neighborhoods to promote the meaning of the integrity movement, distribute printed materials. The association passed three important telegrams yesterday.

Telegram to Chairman Chiang

(Above omitted) Since the War of Resistance, Your Excellency has led the military and civilians in hard work and struggle, and your achievements are great and admired by the whole country. In addition to encouraging the Shanghai women's circle to save money and food, encourage ambition, promote integrity, and vow to be a backing, this association especially sends its respects and asks that you convey our condolences to the soldiers at the front.

Telegram to Chiang Soong Mei-ling

(Above omitted) This association is organized by patriotic women in Shanghai to participate in the integrity movement for half a year. On this occasion of the Women's Memorial Day, Madam serves in the rear, leading women across the country to engage in rescue work. Your virtue and hard work are outstanding. We especially send our respects and ask that you provide guidance to this association. We will certainly strive to do our best.

### A Letter to the Women of the Nation

The Shanghai women's community published a letter to the women of the nation, saying: "Dear sisters, since the International Socialist Women's Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1910, decided that March 8th would be International Women's Day, women in Europe and the United States have responded one after another, all taking this day as a memorial day to fight for equality between men and women in law, politics, economics, and society. Chinese women, pushing the trend, also commemorated this day last year like women in other countries around the world. After years of hard work and struggle, the government has already approved our demands, and has successively formulated many laws and regulations on equality between men and women in law. There are also some women among the senators, and industrial and commercial organizations also allow women to participate. Although the quantity is not large, the principle of equality between men and women has been established. Therefore, the commemoration of March 8th from now on is a stage of moving from fighting for rights to exercising rights, and a turning point from running around and shouting to burying oneself in hard work. In order to live up to the responsibilities given to us by the wheels of the times, we first demand that women themselves have sound moral, intellectual, physical, and group abilities to enrich themselves.

Examining Ourselves

March 8th passes every year, and International Women's Day is commemorated every year. But is the commemoration of this festival today only a feeling of being a year older than today last year, or is it just a case of "following the crowd" to join in the fun? No, of course not. First, since 1910, when March 8th was decided as International Women's Day, it has been exactly thirty years today. Confucius said, "At thirty, one stands firm," because this is the age to make great achievements. Second, our country has also been through exactly thirty months since the War of Resistance. Now the international situation and domestic measures are enough to prove that this year is the year when the dawn is just breaking on the process of national rejuvenation. Let the old be destroyed, and let the unsuitable be eliminated. From now on, how will we endure hardships and move forward on the road to building a great Republic of China? Therefore, we must passively examine ourselves and actively build ourselves. Now, according to the scope of women's activities, there are women studying, professional women, and housewives. According to the region where they are located, there are those under the control of dark forces and those still in the embrace of the motherland. Now let's first examine this from the perspective of region. (A) Women under the control of dark forces, no matter what kind of range they are active in, should deeply examine themselves. Do I have any places to hoard and speculate and exploit others? Do I have any places to unintentionally or intentionally help the Japanese? Do I have any places to use improper forces to bully my compatriots? Do I have any places where I have lost contact with the spirit of the motherland? Do I have any places to be "shameless" and sell my soul? (B) Women in the embrace of the motherland, no matter what kind of range they are active in, should also carefully examine themselves. Do I have any places to be depressed, shake the common belief that the War of Resistance will be won and the country will be built? Do I have any places to be extravagant and wasteful, weakening the national strength? Do I encourage the soldiers who are on the expedition to do their best for the country and their utmost filial piety for the nation? Do I fulfill my responsibility to the country to contribute my strength, money, and money?

Building Ourselves

As for building ourselves, we should do the following things: (1) Eliminate all extravagant and pleasurable lifestyles and decadent and dependent habits, in order to be self-reliant and re-establish others. (2) Enrich ourselves with the ability to take responsibility and handle things. Therefore, regardless of school education or social education, we should humbly accept them in order to be self-aware and then make others aware. (3) Pay attention to the health of the body and mind. With a sound spirit and a sound body, we can then achieve a sound career. With a sound motherhood, we can then have a sound nation. (4) Develop the spirit of sacrificing the small self and fulfilling the big self, and wash away the past criticisms of women as "stingy" and "short-sighted." People say that the Chinese are a pile of loose sand. From now on, we must try to use the efforts of women to turn the 450 million people into a strong mass of clay. In addition, we must especially reform our minds and broaden our horizons. In the past, the minds and eyes of most Chinese women only paid attention to themselves and their families. Now, we should be kind to our relatives and love the people, and love the things. In other words, we should extend our efforts from personal and family efforts to national and ethnic efforts. Therefore, (A) women studying should understand that they are not only seeking knowledge for themselves, but also creating talents for the country. Therefore, when studying, we must work hard, strive for practicality, recognize the goal of applying what we have learned, and not be slaves to diplomas and degrees. (B) Professional women should also understand that this is not only solving their personal lives, but also increasing the strength of the country. Therefore, when working, we must strive for progress, strive for achievements, be practical and realistic, and accumulate experience. (C) Housewives should understand even more that children are not the private property of one person or one family, but the cornerstone of the country and society. We must not only educate them to be virtuous children of one family, but also educate them to be loyal and brave citizens of one country. This year, on November 12th, the government will convene a National Assembly and implement constitutional government. What preparations and contributions should we women make so that the commemoration of March 8th next year will be of greater significance?

Tonight's Banquet

Today is International Women's Day. Due to environmental reasons, women's groups in the city do not intend to hold a meeting ceremony, but only have a large-scale dinner party in the evening. Women from all walks of life in the city will participate to connect their feelings. The Chinese Women's Magazine also publishes a special issue to publish papers commemorating March 8th and discuss how the women's community can build itself.

### The Fixed-Price Grain Sale Will End on Schedule; It is Decided to Continue Until April 7th; The Received 650,000 Yuan Is Still Insufficient

The Shanghai Fixed-Price Grain Sale Committee held its seventh standing committee meeting at its clubhouse at 93 Guangdong Road at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. Chairman Yu Qiaqing reported that as of March 6th, a total of 652,336.18 yuan had been received in donations, and then began to discuss and decide: (1) The current fixed-price grain sale will be temporarily concluded on April 7th (i.e., the end of the second month of the lunar calendar). (2) According to the above regulations, a total of 91,000 bags of rice are needed for this period, plus 34,070 bags sold in the first period, for a total of 125,000 bags of rice. (3) More than 650,000 yuan has been received in donations. According to the above regulations, there is still a shortfall of about 200,000 yuan.

Rampant Robbers Near Warehouses

Xing Zhigang, a standing committee member of the Bean and Grain Industry Association, sent a letter to the association's executive committee yesterday regarding the rampant robbers in the cargo port, which hindered business, requesting that the association send a letter to the Municipal Council for serious punishment. The original letter stated: "Respected Sirs, according to the unanimous claims of our colleagues, the rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains that our colleagues currently own, as well as the various customer goods that are entrusted to us for sale, are all stored in the warehouses of various banks along both sides of the Suzhou Creek, from the east of Nicheng Bridge to the area of Shanxi Road Bridge. The import and export of goods and water and land transportation are all concentrated here. As a result, thieves occupy the area around the port, forming gangs, taking the opportunity to cut bags and plunder, recklessly, and driving away will not go, as a constant business. At this time of rising prices, not only will colleagues import and export goods, the losses are significant, such as on behalf of customer goods, even more unable to compensate. If you do not apply for serious punishment, how to secure the area to stop banditry, etc. Based on this, we specially request the Executive Committee, you will appreciate the facts, and quickly send a letter to the Municipal Council to order the Police Department to immediately add fixed posts and strict patrols back and forth in the area from the east of Nicheng Bridge to Shanxi Road, along the warehouses of various banks on both sides of the Suzhou Creek, in order to stop banditry and secure the business, unspeakable gratitude."

### Shanghai's Overabundance of Floating Capital; Approximately 300 Million Yuan; 100 Million Yuan of Which Has Nowhere to Go; Surplus Capital in the Market Mostly Invested in Speculation and Profit-Making

Funds from the occupied areas after the war are concentrated in Shanghai, and after the European War, funds from Hong Kong and other places have returned to Shanghai, resulting in an overabundance of floating capital in Shanghai. According to inquiries with banking circles yesterday, the floating capital gathered in the Shanghai market is at least 300 million yuan, of which 50% is current deposits in various banks, 10% is invested in emerging industries in western Shanghai, and the remaining 40% is surplus floating capital, which flows into speculation. The main targets of speculation are: (1) buying and selling foreign exchange and arbitrage, (2) hoarding daily necessities, (3) buying and selling black market gold, (4) buying and selling stocks and bonds, (5) operating remittance and discount, (6) buying and selling foreign currency and banknotes. The above are the biggest factors contributing to today's soaring prices.

### American Resident Arnhold, Candidate for Chairman of the Municipal Council, Has Been Formally Proposed to the American Residents' Association

The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that the American Residents' Association has already nominated two candidates for Chairman of the Municipal Council, one is Carl Nah, former director of the Municipal Council, and the other is McDonald, the current director. However, today (the 7th), someone proposed to the association to nominate lawyer Arnhold as a candidate. Therefore, American residents in the city will hold a preliminary election to select two of them and eliminate one. According to the American Residents' Association's election law, candidates for Chairman of the Municipal Council must be nominated by ten American residents who pay taxes. However, the response of American residents to nominate Arnhold is very enthusiastic, reaching fifty to one hundred people. It is still unknown whether there will be other candidates before the preliminary election. However, if there are any proposals, they must be submitted to the American Residents' Association Secretary Huo Husi no later than Monday next week. It is reported that Carl Nah is the assistant manager of Standard Oil Company, who resigned from his position as director of the Municipal Council last year without stating any reasons. McDonald is the general manager of Wheelock & Co., who was appointed as director to fill the vacancy left by Nah.

### Conflict Among Puppet Officials; Tense Situation

On both sides of Avenue Foch in western Shanghai, there are many military and special agencies of puppet organizations. Recently, a "Self-Defense Corps" has been added. At the same time, Ding Xishan, who lost power in Pudong, also established an agency on this road with his remnants. Therefore, there are many people carrying weapons in plain clothes, and disputes often arise over property.

Fighting Erupted the Night Before

At about 10:00 p.m. the night before (the 6th), a battle broke out at the entrance of Xinkang Lane on Avenue Foch. More than 20 shots were fired, and a person from a certain agency even fired more than 10 shots with a machine gun. As a result, many people on the opposing side were injured and more than 10 people were arrested. The

Cause of the Incident

was that one side of the enemy ate dinner at Xinghualou in Wujiaochang, gathering more than 30 people, plotting to harm a certain agency, so it was a preemptive plan. They often claimed to be arresting thieves, bullets flying horizontally, for 20 minutes, all shops and residents

Closed Their Doors One After Another

The Zheng Qia Ji, Ying Chang, Xiesheng and other local firms in Xinkang Lane quickly closed their doors, while the gambling dens, Dasheng Company, Shenji Company, etc., which were high-spirited, all found people holding guns during the chaos to rob and disrupt order.

Extremely Chaotic

The gambling dens in Xinkang Lane then pulled down iron gates, and the managers in charge of each escaped from the back door. It was not until half an hour later that order was restored, but they had already been frightened. According to local merchants, it is best not to pass through the area of Avenue Foch, Connaught Road, and Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai before 6:00 a.m. and after 8:00 p.m.

### The Salvation Army Continues to Receive Donations from All Walks of Life

People from all walks of life are welcome to visit and drive.

### Taikoo Company Sends Ships from Shanghai Directly to Luzon to Recover Losses After the Suspension of the Swatow-Amoy Route; The Changjiakou Has Been Sent for a Trial Voyage

Since the successive fall of Swatow and Guangzhou in South China, foreign ships operating on the South China route have been severely affected. The above two places have now become the exclusive transportation territory of Japanese ships, and foreign ships are equivalent to being suspended. Previously, Taikoo Company's direct routes from Swatow and Amoy to Southeast Asia, Siam, Saigon, and Singapore were all changed to

Operate in This City

and a new route from Shanghai to Haiphong was opened, combining Hong Kong, Guangzhou Bay, Haikou, and Beihai to Haiphong. After the Japanese army landed in Beihai in October last year, the ships were suspended again. The above situations have been repeatedly recorded in previous reports. It is heard that Taikoo Company intends to recover the losses from the suspended routes in South China, and has specially changed the Amoy-Luzon route to a direct route from Shanghai. The plan

Has Been Completed

The Changjiakou has been scheduled to export at noon yesterday, departing directly from Shanghai to Luzon, stopping at only one port, Hong Kong. The ship was on its first trial voyage yesterday, so there were not many goods and few passengers loaded from Shanghai. The company has not officially announced the new Luzon route. It is generally expected that after the ship returns to Shanghai from its trial voyage, a formal schedule for long-term operation will be set, at which time the freight and passengers may improve.

### Lack of Full Power in the Northern District Police; It is Difficult to Stop Raids; Raiding Teams are Active Due to Unrest in the Area; Japanese Spokesperson Still Tries to Conceal the Facts

The Continental Daily News reports that people in the Public Concession Police Department stated last night that if there is no police management in Hongkou for a long time, it will be difficult to stop the forced conscription of Chinese into hard labor near the Japanese-controlled area. At present, the area north of the Suzhou Creek is neither managed by the Japanese Marine Corps nor controlled by the Police Department, resulting in an unstable situation. Raiding teams can

Act at Will

The number of police officers working in the northern district is very limited, and they are hindered by a lack of full power. The fact that Chinese can freely enter Hamabe without a pass is undoubtedly a factor that facilitates illegal raiding. There is no doubt that the Japanese are related to forced labor, but those who carry out the forced conscription are mostly Koreans and Taiwanese. It is heard that

The Conscripted Chinese

are being sent to Pudong and Wusong to build roads, and some are being sent to various places downstream of the Yangtze River, but no one has been transported to Japan. The Japanese side again denied this kind of terrorist action yesterday. A Japanese Navy spokesperson, when meeting with reporters yesterday, referred to the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury's report yesterday that Japanese raiding teams were active in Hamabe.

Confirmed

The news, said, "There are currently no facts that can confirm the raiding reported in the newspaper. This statement is propaganda issued by certain people with specific purposes." The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reporter then said, "The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury received this information directly from the Deputy Commissioner of the Public Concession Police Department." The spokesperson replied that it is possible that suspicious persons or criminals may be arrested, but the Japanese authorities have never carried out large-scale arrests or detention of Chinese for hard labor, nor have they instructed anyone to do so. Anyone who can provide evidence of raiding activities and notify the Japanese Marine Corps will be greatly appreciated.

### No Progress in Salvaging the Jingsheng Wheel; Bodies of Passengers Who Died Must Wait to be Recovered After the Incident

Since the Jingsheng Wheel sank at the mouth of the Yong River on the 2nd of this month, more than hundreds of passengers have drowned, causing an unprecedented tragedy in Ningbo. Although the Ningbo community has organized a relief association to salvage the sunken ship in order to recover all the bodies, the initial salvage has not been successful due to the heavy weight of the ship.

Examining the Sunken Ship

The Ningbo Tugboat Company has now hired a batch of salvagers from Shanghai, who have arrived in Ningbo and will go to the Sanjiangkou in the Yong River to enter the water to test the situation of the sunken ship, and then carry out salvage. The work of recovering the bodies must be carried out after the ship is out of the water.

Enthusiastic Donations

The Ningbo Jingsheng Wheel Relief Committee is currently handling various procedures such as registering the relatives of the deceased, disposing of relics, and purchasing funeral supplies. In terms of expenses, in addition to the 10,000 yuan raised by the Ningbo community, the 10,000 yuan donated by the Shanghai Compatriots Association has also been remitted, and donations from all walks of life are also very enthusiastic.

Collecting Opinions

In view of the seriousness of the Jingsheng Wheel tragedy, the Ningbo Shanghai Compatriots Association has been seeking opinions from all walks of life on the Shanghai-Ningbo voyage from the beginning, and after collecting them, it plans to submit concrete opinions for the authorities to adopt and implement, in order to benefit shipping and value people's lives.

### Although Under Violence, The Czech Spirit Will Not Die; Yesterday Commemorated the Birthday of the Late President Masaryk; The Deeds of a Great Statesman Throughout His Life Are Worthy of Pride

The Continental Daily News reports that although the Czech Republic is now under German rule, the Czech people have not forgotten their former President Masaryk, who helped the country gain freedom. The Czech community in this city will hold a memorial service for Masaryk's 90th birthday at the Czech General Assembly at 8:30 p.m. tonight (the 7th), with speeches recounting the life deeds of the great statesman. It is heard that among the approximately 250 Czech residents in this city, very few have registered with the German Consulate, and the Czech Embassy in this city has been closed after the German annexation of the Czech Republic.

Czech President

Masaryk, yesterday was his birthday commemoration, and also the 19th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of that country. The Czech community in Shanghai held a celebration and commemoration at 8:30 a.m. yesterday. The former Czechoslovakia was part of Austria-Hungary. After the outbreak of the European War, Austria-Hungary disintegrated. After three years of hard fighting,

Announced Independence

The Treaty of Versailles was concluded, and Masaryk was elected as the first president of the republican government. According to statistics, there are only 250 Czech residents in Shanghai. President Masaryk retired in 1936 and was succeeded by Benes. Masaryk passed away on September 11, 1937, at the age of 87.

Czech Hero

Masaryk was born on March 7, 1850, in a poor family. At the age of 16, he was a blacksmith. Later, he studied in middle school. After graduating, he entered the University of Vienna. Later, in Leipzig, Germany, he married an American young woman, Caregy. Masaryk wrote a lot, among which the book Czech Questions is especially valuable. For a time, Luoyang paper was expensive, and it became popular throughout the country.

After the Outbreak of the European War

Masaryk was then a professor at the Czech University. He was wanted for his political intentions. Therefore, he fled abroad to promote Czech independence. His footprints passed through England, France, Russia, Italy, and the Atlantic to the United States. In Russia, Masaryk formed the Czech army and participated in Soviet Russia.

Fighting with Germany

After the restoration of Tsarist Russia, Masaryk was the commander-in-chief of the Czech army. He arrived at the border before Hitler. In 1919, the European War was peaceful and the Treaty of Versailles was concluded. Masaryk almost served as the first president, as the national hero of the Czech Republic.

### Cost of Living Index for Workers Last Month Unprecedented; Economic Condition of Industry Dominated by Fuel; Purchasing Power of Currency Only One-Quarter of Pre-War Level; Factories Can Adjust Wages According to Index

According to the Industrial Section's February report from the Shanghai Municipal Council, the economic condition of the industrial sector in Shanghai last month was almost entirely dominated by the fuel issue. The soaring price of coal, coupled with concerns about further increases and shortages, caused anxiety among factories. While some larger factories continued to operate, most smaller factories took advantage of the Spring Festival holiday to temporarily suspend operations. Dyeing factories were particularly numerous among those suspending work. Some factories are even considering switching to diesel fuel to replace coal, and plans to locally manufacture oil burner injectors are also under research. Several export merchants, seeking to procure industrial products suitable for overseas markets but unaware of the factories' locations, repeatedly consulted the Industrial Section. This matter is crucial to the future of Shanghai's industry, so the Section is happy to provide guidance. The arrival of silk cocoons was higher than in the past. After the Spring Festival, seven silk factories resumed operations, with four more expected to follow soon. Work at the paper mills was extremely busy. Machine factories extended working hours to step up production to meet demand.

Industrial Disputes

In October, the Industrial Section handled 11 labor disputes, including six strikes and five non-strike labor disputes. Two strikes and two labor disputes were caused by demands for wage increases, while three strikes and one labor dispute were caused by demands for subsidies. One strike and one labor dispute were caused by the dismissal of workers, and one labor dispute was caused by the employer's shutdown. The factories where strikes occurred included two Chinese-owned factories, four British and American-owned factories, and one Russian-owned factory, including four cotton mills and two machine factories.

Wage Adjustments

Regarding wage adjustments, in addition to workers' requests, many factory owners have also taken the initiative to adjust wages. They often consult the Industrial Section for reliable data to use as a basis. Recognizing that the true maximum market price of rice is difficult to obtain due to the black market, the Industrial Section has instructed several factory owners to use the cost of living index for workers compiled by the Section and to increase wages accordingly based on the index. This approach has already been adopted by a major industrial company, which first used the prices of six commodities in August of last year as a basis and then increased wages by a certain percentage based on the current rate of price increases. For example, the prices of the six commodities in August of last year have now increased by 78%. In February, in addition to the previously added amounts and rice subsidies, an additional 20% subsidy was issued. This measure is indeed commendable for resolving wage disputes and serves as a model.

Cost of Living Index

The cost of living index and retail prices for Shanghai workers in February 1940: The cost of living index for workers in Shanghai in February continued to rise from January, reaching 377.92, an increase of 51.48 points, or 16.13%. The beginning of this month coincided with the end and beginning of the lunar year. Prices during the year-end period soared to unprecedented levels. Green vegetables rose to $0.10 per catty, fresh pork and lard to $1.25 per catty, chickens to $1.60 per catty, and crucian carp to $1.52 per catty. These increases cannot be explained solely by the usual high prices during the New Year. In previous years, prices would fall after the New Year, but after the market reopened on the 12th of this month, foreign exchange rates declined and gold prices soared. Apart from a slight decrease in the prices of fish, meat, and vegetables, the prices of rice, flour, and coal briquettes reached unprecedented highs. The black market price of Grade 2 white japonica rice reached $50 per picul. Indica rice was unavailable in the market, leading to high demand for Saigon rice. Therefore, in this month's index, the price of Indica rice had to be replaced with Grade 2 Saigon rice, with the selling price also reaching over $47. Flour was over $15 per bag, and coal briquettes even reached $7 per dan. The prices of daily necessities rose to extreme levels, causing panic among citizens. People from all walks of life are working hard to suppress market prices. Rice, flour, and coal briquettes are being sold at subsidized prices. The authorities in both concessions are also discussing price controls. By the end of the month, the situation began to ease slightly.

Price Increases

The prices of all items this month were higher than last month. Among the classified indices, the miscellaneous category increased the most dramatically, reaching 355.99, an increase of 39.13%. The food category was 394.07, an increase of 16.60%. The fuel category was 433.48, an increase of 15.83%. The clothing category was 264.36, an increase of 9.80%. The purchasing power of currency this month was such that one yuan in legal tender was only worth $0.2646 in 1936. Among the 58 commodities, the prices of 51 items were higher than last month, with 8 items increasing by 30% or more, 13 items increasing by 20% or more, 13 items increasing by 10% or more, and 18 items increasing by less than 10%. The following lists the commodities with the most dramatic price increases:

Coal briquettes up 39.68% from last month Flour up 33.15% Hot water up 88.00% Soy sauce up 33.33%

Coal briquettes up 39.68% Flour up 33.15% Hot water up 88.00% Soy sauce up 33.33%

### Shanghai Municipal Council Improves the Lives of Rickshaw Pullers

The Shanghai Municipal Council, in order to improve the lives of public rickshaw pullers, has revised the rickshaw fares as follows: A. Calculated by distance: the initial half-mile costs $0.10 in national currency, and each subsequent half-mile or fraction thereof costs $0.05 in national currency, with a minimum fare of $0.10 in national currency. B. Calculated by time: the initial hour costs $0.60 in national currency, and each subsequent half-hour or fraction thereof costs $0.30 in national currency, with a minimum fare of $0.60 in national currency. The Council has also taken strict measures against some rickshaw owners who overcharge beyond the approved maximum rent. These measures aim to ensure that owners adhere to the approved rent restrictions. The Council has now authorized the police to revoke licenses entirely if they find owners overcharging. To encourage and assist rickshaw pullers in maintaining their rents below the newly established maximums, the Council has resolved to widely publicize and adopt other measures to ensure that all rickshaw pullers are aware that owners who overcharge will be punished.

Encountered Violence En Route

Yesterday was the anniversary of Shi's mother's death, and he invited relatives and friends for lunch at his residence. After the meal, Shi left his private car to go to the branch store. Unexpectedly, when the car passed the intersection of Mughan Road and Wuding Road, two thugs lying in ambush there opened fire on him. Two shots were fired, one hitting his right chest and the other his left abdomen, causing blood to gush out. He was barely alive. The driver, seeing his boss being savagely attacked, was terrified. Passersby heard the shots and gathered around. By the time the nearby police arrived, the assailants had taken the opportunity to escape without a trace.

Life in Critical Condition

An ambulance was immediately called to rush Shi to Shilang Hospital for treatment. The bullets did not exit, and his injuries are severe, leaving his life in critical condition. It is rumored that Shi, in addition to selling hemp bags to a certain party, had recently hoarded rice. The police are still conducting a thorough investigation to determine the truth.

### Robbery on Jiujiang Road; One Thief Killed

At 9:30 PM last night, a thief broke into a store at 515 Jiujiang Road, brandishing a gun. He robbed the store of $75.21 in legal tender, and fled. Apprentices from the store immediately reported the robbery to Police Station 3051. A Chinese officer gave chase, pursuing the thief to the vicinity of Guangxi Road and Shantou Road. The officer fired two shots at the thief, both bullets hitting the thief in the chest. He fell to the ground, dying on the spot. The police recovered a pistol and the stolen legal tender. An ambulance was called to take the body to the police hospital, then transferred to the morgue for examination. The dead thief was named Yan Haide, 35 years old, and suffered two gunshot wounds to the chest.

Pedestrian Search: One Injured, Two Captured

At 6:50 PM last night, patrol officers passed the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Race Course Road when they spotted three pedestrians who appeared suspicious. Undercover officers attempted to search them and ordered them to stop. Instead of stopping, the three turned to flee, and then put their hands in their pockets, drew pistols, and resisted arrest. The officers opened fire on the three, injuring one person and capturing two. Two pistols were recovered. An ambulance was called to take the injured person to the police hospital. The injured person was identified as Jin Zhenhai, 24 years old, with a bullet wound to the chest.

### Profiteering Merchant, Rogue Extortion

According to Shanghai Guangshe News, Qian Jintao, a local resident of 319 Huachengfang, Minquan Road, makes a living by selling Japanese cotton and has profited considerably. This was discovered by Wang Genfa, a Suzhou rogue, who, at around 4:00 PM on the 12th of last month, gathered four or five accomplices to extort money, demanding $300. Qian only ordered someone to offer $10, a significant difference that led to failure. Wang then ordered his gang to twist and beat Qian, causing Wang to injure Qian's left eye with a stool and deafen his left ear. Qian shouted for help, and his family members apprehended Wang. The First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court prosecuted Wang for extortion and assault. Yesterday morning, Judge Liao concluded the trial, sentencing Wang Genfa to three months' imprisonment for assault. The other charges were dismissed. The plaintiff's civil suit was transferred to the civil court.

### Water Dispute on Great Western Road; Caused by Failure to Pay Water Bills; Pseudo "Municipal Government" Protests

According to the English-language "The China Press," the Japanese "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" reported today (the 7th) that the Shanghai Waterworks Company recently cut off the water supply to the residents of Meicun Village and Sancheng Village (both transliterations) on Great Western Road because they had not paid their water bills. The "Shanghai Municipal Government" protested to the Shanghai Waterworks Company regarding the water cutoff, citing the agreement signed with the Shanghai Municipal Council to improve the situation in the extraterritorial road area of Western Shanghai.

### Dai Qinghua, a Clerk at a Gambling Den, Arrested for Illegally Withdrawing Funds; Mrs. Wang Huang Suffers a Loss of $5,000

Wang Liansheng, a resident of 68 Renheli, Songshan Road in the French Concession, is about 50 years old. He suffers from a nervous disorder and is unemployed at home. All household and financial matters are managed by his wife, Mrs. Wang Huang (42 years old, from Dinghai). They live off their ancestral property. Dai Qinghua, a 25-year-old native of Dinghai, was a neighbor of the Wang family in his hometown. Dai had been

Living and Eating at the Wang's Home

Serving Mrs. Wang Huang since the age of 14 or 15. He recently found a job at a club in Western Shanghai but still frequently visited the Wang's home. Mrs. Wang Huang had $8,000 in cash deposited in the Bank of China on the Bund and held a passbook. However, Mrs. Wang did not know how to read and write and regarded Dai as a trusted person. Therefore, whenever she went to the bank to withdraw money, she always asked Dai to go on her behalf. On the 16th of last month, Mrs. Wang ordered Dai to go to the Bank of China to withdraw $500. Instead, Dai

Took the Opportunity to Withdraw More

$1,000 and lost it all at a gambling den in Western Shanghai. Mrs. Wang discovered this and checked the passbook with the bank. She also found that before withdrawing the additional $1,000, Dai had secretly taken the passbook and withdrawn $4,000 from the bank, also losing it in the gambling den. Therefore, Mrs. Wang reported the incident to the French police and requested an investigation. Since Dai was in the occupied area of Western Shanghai, detectives could not go to arrest him. Therefore, Mrs. Wang went to Western Shanghai herself the day before yesterday and lured Dai to her home. She then reported to the police, who sent detectives to

Arrest Dai

Yesterday, Dai was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, requesting a preliminary investigation and then a trial. The defendant, Dai Qinghua, hired lawyer Li Pengcheng to defend him. The plaintiff, Mrs. Wang Huang, first stated how the defendant stole the passbook and withdrew the money, as well as how she discovered the crime. She also appointed a lawyer to file a civil suit. When questioned, Dai confessed that he had first withdrawn $4,000. "The plaintiff called me to get it, and then we went together to Western Shanghai. After losing that in gambling, I withdrew another $1,000, and we

Went Gambling Together"

Judge Zhu Chuzhe verified the confession and ordered a further hearing on the 14th. The defendant was remanded in custody. After the court adjourned, the defendant's sisters and wife waited outside the court and began to scold Mrs. Wang Huang, accusing her of having a relationship with Dai and becoming jealous because Dai had found another lover, leading her to take this vengeful action. The two sides traded insults until the bailiffs and doorkeepers intervened and stopped them. Both sides then went their separate ways.

### Old News Re-Copied; Sixty-Seven Years Ago (317) (See This Newspaper from the Twelfth Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Late Qing Dynasty)

Official Salaries

In the Zhouli, the Minister of Personnel's six offices had hundreds of officials of various ranks, making the Zhou Dynasty's officialdom the most extensive. Mencius discussed the Zhou Dynasty's system of ranks and salaries, where every official, from the Emperor to the commoners, was given public land. The Zhou Dynasty's salaries were significant. Although the Han Dynasty's officials were greater in number than in the Zhou Dynasty, the Han Dynasty's salaries were comparable. A prefect had an annual salary of 2,000 shi, and his subordinates had salaries of several hundred shi. After the Wei and Jin dynasties, officials were selected by the court, and their salaries became meager. The current dynasty established official systems and salaries by carefully considering the laws of previous dynasties, adopting the best. All officials, both internal and external, have subordinates. In addition to actual positions, there are also candidate officials waiting to be assigned. Every yamen, from provincial and judicial commissioners downwards and prefectures and counties upwards, has assistant officials. Initially, all officials, both internal and external, received only salary in rice and silver. Later, internal officials received food allowances, and external officials received "corruption prevention" allowances. Unfortunately, people's hearts are not as they used to be. External officials in each province all fear that subordinates who are not their private individuals are unfit to assist. Therefore, they invite private individuals as advisors, making the officials appointed by the court mere figureheads. However, in the Imperial Cabinet, Ministries, and Courts in the capital, there are no advisors. Staff and scribes are used to assist, and there are no reports of dereliction of duty or corruption. When the Emperors Shunzhi and Kangxi ruled, the silver and rice received by officials in the capital were insufficient for household expenses. Wei Minguo, a noble of Weizhou, was a famous upright minister at the time. Only his relative surnamed Li helped him with 300 taels of silver each year, allowing Wei Minguo to remain unblemished. He did not have to be like Tang Wenzheng, who only ate tofu and wore tattered clothes. Later, the yamens added food allowances, with some officials receiving over 1,000 taels per year and others receiving several hundred, making it possible for all officials to have sufficient funds.

Trifling Words for March 8th

### Today's "Three Obediences and Four Virtues"

— Ju Yan

Today is "March 8th," a day for women to enjoy liberation, "freedom," and "equality." During this enthusiastic celebration, I must tell the women on "isolated islands" about the "New Three Obediences and Four Virtues." I sincerely hope that you will implement them starting today.

New "Three Obediences": (1) "Obey" your own abilities to work hard and support yourself independently, avoiding the shame of marrying as a career.

(2) "Obey" your own efforts to seek happiness for the country and engage in national salvation work, such as serving in the military, providing battlefield first aid, and other rear support work. Strive for the great era and shed the contempt of being a "fragile, spoiled woman."

(3) "Obey" your own knowledge to break down all unjust things, such as not using the banner of new women as a guise for enjoyment, treating education as decoration, and removing the negative labels of "vanity," "gold-worship," "decoration," and "vase."

New "Four Virtues": (1) Not wearing gorgeous clothes, and especially not wearing enemy goods, is called being able to cultivate the "virtue" of "simplicity and frugality."

(2) Not using makeup to avoid money outflow is called being able to achieve the "virtue" of "thrift."

(3) Not being numb and greedy, sacrificing one's body to act as a traitor, is called being able to avoid the "virtue" of being a "disaster."

(4) Not admiring vanity and gold-worship, avoiding the humiliation of being treated as a plaything, is called being able to avoid being seen as a "toy."

### A Small Report

— Chu

After the Shanghai Municipal Council Announced the Tax Increase

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council announced the tax increase, all parties have earnestly pleaded, hoping that the authorities will adjust their plans based on existing revenue and not increase the burden on citizens during this time of economic hardship. I believe that the wise Shanghai Municipal Council will seriously consider and accept the demands of all citizens within the realm of possibility.

Now, here is another small report to illustrate the inevitable consequences of the Shanghai Municipal Council's tax increase.

A friend of mine, an elementary school teacher, originally lived in the Western Shanghai area outside the concessions. A week ago, he decided to find a house in the concessions because he could not tolerate the various unnecessary troubles. He found a garret in the French Concession. The landlord was an old Ningbo woman. She was happy to hear that he was a "teacher" without family. The rent was set at 15 yuan a month, reduced from the original 18 yuan. At that time, my friend paid a deposit of two yuan, agreeing to move in the next day. However, because he was busy with schoolwork, he was two days late. When he went to move in, the Ningbo landlady suddenly changed her mind, refusing to rent for less than 20 yuan. Otherwise, she would rather return the deposit. My friend argued with her, and she explained her reasons.

The reason she was willing to rent cheaply for 15 yuan was that a single tenant could save on the water bill. Now that the Shanghai Municipal Council is raising taxes, she assumed that water and electricity prices would also rise, so she also wanted to add five yuan per month.

My friend immediately explained to her that all parties were asking the Shanghai Municipal Council to cancel the tax increase. Even if it had to be increased, it would not start until the second half of the year. How could the rent be increased immediately? And an increase of five yuan!

The landlady naturally had her reasons. She said that tenants often argued about rent increases after they moved in, so it was important to settle it before moving in. However, she said honestly that she would not increase the rent again when the Shanghai Municipal Council increased taxes.

My friend had no choice but to take back the deposit and continue looking for a house.

From the above facts, it can be seen that if the Shanghai Municipal Council increases taxes, not only rent in Shanghai but also all goods will inevitably be stimulated to rise in price. Some people say that the Ningbo woman was ignorant and immediately increased the rent by five yuan when she heard about the tax increase. But precisely because there are too many people in Shanghai who understand the situation, they are much stronger than that Ningbo woman. What they hope for is not five yuan. They are looking for opportunities to make a fortune of 50, 500, 5,000, or 50,000!

### Disagreement: Penalty of Copying

— Hui

Regarding the Issue of Elementary School Students Eating Snacks

Regarding the issue of elementary school students eating snacks, the several methods proposed by Mr. Xinliang are quite good and can indeed serve as a reference for teachers and parents. However, in the section labeled "School Aspects," the author believes there is much room for consideration. Because, according to child psychology, children hate punishment the most. If we further punish them by copying and writing, it will cause them to transfer their anger to copying and writing. Every time they encounter copying and writing in the future, they will develop aversion, thus creating a psychological aversion to copying and writing. This is called "alternate reflection" in psychology. Therefore, the author's meaning is that instead of punishing them to copy and write, it is better to punish them to sit quietly or not to play with other children. Because children fear loneliness the most. At the same time, you can use this time to let them reflect. As psychology says: "Punishing them with what they fear most can make them fear what they did." Such gains may be more effective.

Episode 21: Managing Economics with Mixed Fibers, Promoting Machinery to Assist Literary Achievements

After the two Miss He returned from the International Hotel, Zhu Ai'ren said to them, "Shao Huihua just called and arranged for us to visit the newspaper office where she works tonight. Around five or six o'clock, she will send a car to pick us up, asking us to gather at one place. Including her, there will be six people in total. She said she would also treat us to dinner in the newspaper's restaurant." He Liyu laughed and said, "Sister Ai'ren! You miscalculated the number of people! We were originally six people, but since Sister Junke went back to Suzhou, we are now only five." Zhu Ai'ren laughed and said, "You may not know, although we are missing one person, we have gained another, and we are still six people." Liyu asked, "Really? Who is the new person?" Ai'ren said, "Guess who it is! Let me tell you! It's that bride, Sister Danyun. She heard that we were going to visit and wanted to go with us. Actually, she has accompanied foreign guests to visit before, but she said: Accompanying foreign guests is not very interesting. It's more interesting to go with our sisters, and it's even better with Shao Huihua guiding us. Although she is a bride, she is unwilling to sit quietly at home." He Liyu said, "That's great. We are missing one person and gained another, so we are still six people." After a while, Wu Junsu also came and said, "I received a call from Shao Huihua asking everyone to gather here. I also heard that the bride is going too. Is that true?" Zhu Ai'ren nodded and said, "Yes! Today we are going to visit the newspaper office with two guides. One is Shao Huihua, and the other is Jin Danyun. Jin Danyun has accompanied guests to visit before. Unlike us, we have never visited before, so she certainly knows more than us." Wu Junsu said, "Sister Danyun is newly married and should be spending that sweet time with her groom. Instead, she's running around with us sisters?" Zhu Ai'ren said, "And what about you? You mean, if it were you, you wouldn't be willing to give up this sweet time." This made everyone laugh, and Wu Junsu blushed and said, "Sister Ai'ren is deliberately asking me to confess. None of us are married yet. We'll see in the future." Before she finished speaking, Jin Danyun had already pushed the door open and entered, saying, "I heard you laughing outside the door. What are you laughing about?" Wu Junsu said, "We were laughing at you." Jin Danyun said, "Laughing at me for what? What's so funny about me?" He Liyu said, "Sister Danyun! Don't listen to her! We're not laughing at you, we're laughing at her." Then she told about Ai'ren and Junsu's jokes, and everyone laughed again.

### Placing High Hopes on the "Price Stabilization Committee"

— Fu Yong

Amidst the fervent expectations of the four to five million residents of the isolated island, the concession authorities have swiftly organized the "Price Stabilization Committee." With the arrival of this gratifying news, besides our immense joy, we also need to place "high hopes" on the committee. Namely, we earnestly hope that price stabilization will be implemented soon to alleviate the pain of being "financially constrained." We earnestly hope that price stabilization will be effectively implemented and not "end up with no follow-up." And we have a few superficial opinions for the committee members to consider:

(1) The so-called "price stabilization" certainly cannot suppress the market prices of various goods to the same level as before the war, but it is always better the lower it is, to suppress them as much as possible. Because the prosperity of the isolated island is only a superficial layer of sugar coating, and most people have extremely weak purchasing power!

(2) Authoritative methods and capabilities can be used to warn unscrupulous merchants who "hoard goods for profit." This is an indirect way to suppress prices!

(3) Advise citizens not to panic excessively, so that prices are not "driven up" by shouting!

(4) Expand price-controlled grain sales and general sales, the longer the better! The scope and capital should also be as large as possible!

### Responsibility for Faith (II)

In this way, we should be responsible for our own ignorance and for our own beliefs. One may not believe in property ownership, but if he takes his neighbor's things without permission, such lack of virtue and faith cannot prevent him from being accused. One may believe in revenge, considering it his duty and honor, but in a civilized society, such murderous belief cannot save him from hanging. Our beliefs are the cause and effect of our actions. Scoundrels believe that people have value. If they can live safely like this, they will inevitably be unscrupulous and full of deceit. Lascivious people believe that there is no such thing as honor and chastity between men and women. Materialists do not believe in the interconnectedness of spirit, actions, and beliefs. These people behave this way because they first have this belief. Christ calls people to believe in him. If people do not believe and do not accept his call, it is because they have sin in their hearts and cannot respond to this most noble call. "Who do you think Christ is?" This is an experiment. If the person answering cannot believe, he is already condemned by his inability to respond. His judgment is blinded by sin. He must first remove the sin in his heart before he can believe. Therefore, Christ is the great touchstone of life and character. Those who believe are forgiven because their past life led them to accept Christ's call. Those who do not believe are condemned because their past life led them to reject Christ's call. The church's mission to Christ is often misunderstood. The church's primary mission is not, as commonly said, to change the world. This is not the church's work, nor does the church have the power to accomplish this task. The church's work is to report, proclaim, and teach people the gospel, to spread the gospel everywhere, regardless of whether people listen or not. In other words, it is to tell everyone about Christ, so that everyone can face and know Christ, and let Christ himself call out to people. Changing the world is God's work, because God is the Lord of life and the giver of life. The great failure of evangelistic work is in forcing people to accept various creeds or books, instead of allowing them to meet and know Christ. Because the important question is "Who do you think Christ is?" not what do creeds or books say? People are responsible for their own beliefs. Those who strive to live an unselfish and reasonable life will be able to respond to Christ's call. Conversely, those who live a selfish and lustful life will reject it. Believing in Christ can be said to be the true test of personality, because believing in Christ is believing in the most perfect personality. Not believing in Christ is not believing in the most perfect personality. Therefore, those of us who do not believe in Christ should repeatedly ask ourselves why we do not believe.

### The Fifth Anniversary of Ruan Lingyu's Death

— Yongquan

Today is again the March 8th International Women's Day.

If one pays a little attention to domestic films, and is not a forgetful person, one should still remember that five years ago today, we lost a universally respected artist—Ms. Ruan Lingyu!

Ms. Ruan can be said to be a pioneer of domestic films in our country. She entered the film industry at the age of seventeen in 1926, and worked in the film industry for a full nine years, shooting twenty-nine films. She had outstanding and extraordinary acting skills. Regarding her acting skills, I remember a friend once made an accurate critique, saying that her strengths were firstly, a wide range, that is, not solidifying herself in a small area, and being able to play various roles; secondly, development, that is, being willing to work hard and do as much as needed. These two points are lacking in most Chinese actors.

Her private life was very disciplined, she was extremely frugal, and she was very kind and amiable, without any "star" airs. She also had no vanity and was pragmatic. When others were enthusiastically vying for the "Movie Queen" crown, she remained indifferent. She did not need this meaningless and feudal title; however, among the vast audience, she was the most supported and most welcomed, clearly an uncrowned movie queen.

Even more worthy of commemoration and admiration, she was an artist with conscience, never relying on her appearance to seduce the audience, always serving the goal of "film education," never acting in films with distorted consciousness and toxins, and never acting as an executioner who killed the audience!

Ms. Ruan had so many admirable qualities, which is why we still miss her from time to time. ——But I sometimes think of her for another reason: If Ms. Ruan were still alive today, and still staying in Shanghai, would she act in those boring films? A few feet of coffin, a thousand years of crimson blood, in the blink of an eye, five years have passed since Ms. Ruan's death. But although time has passed, the three words "Ruan Lingyu" will live forever in people's hearts along with the more successful films she starred in!

Rest in peace, artist! On this, the day of your fifth anniversary, I sincerely pay my respects to your spirit in heaven.

### The "China" Northwest Film Crew All Personnel Arrive in Yulin to Screen "Good Husband" and Begin Filming

— Huicun

The Northwest Film Crew of the Chongqing China Film Studio, with a group of staff members including Lili Li, Xiuwen Shu, Wuyin Wu, Tianguo Chen, and the renowned artist Shen Yiqian as a consultant, totaling more than fifty people, led by team leader Ying Yunwei, set off from Chongqing on the fifth of last month to actually film scenes in the Sui-Mongolian border area and to conduct roving screenings.

The entire team's living discipline and organization were all in accordance with military methods. Lili Li, Xiuwen Shu, and others all wore thick cotton military uniforms, carrying dry food bags, water bottles, and all other necessary items. They departed from Chongqing by truck on the morning of the fifth, and stayed overnight in Rongchang County. The next day, they spent the night in the Xixi River, and arrived in Chengdu on the afternoon of the seventh. They stayed in Chengdu for four days, where they were entertained separately by dozens of local cultural and drama groups. The entire team also visited the Northwest Film Studio.

On the eleventh, the entire team left Chengdu and continued north. Along the way, they were warmly received and farewelled by various counties, but they did not stay for many days, so the journey was quite fast. On the afternoon of the seventeenth, they had already arrived in Xijing (Xi'an). There, they were again warmly welcomed by various cultural and drama groups. The entire team also individually toured the city of Xi'an and nearby scenic spots. They stayed in Xi'an for two days, and on the morning of the nineteenth, they again embarked on the journey towards Yulin.

According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Yulin: The entire team arrived on the afternoon of the twenty-first. In addition to screening new films such as "Special Anti-Japanese War" and "Good Husband" there, they will also go outside the Great Wall to begin filming work, it is said.

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

The Unmatched Battle of Changban Slope at the Ferry of Jin (Part 2)

At that time, Huisheng only received a monthly salary of eight hundred yuan, which was only one-fourth of Xiaoyun's. Therefore, he could only sing the first three opening acts. The plays he performed every day were always of the type of "Heavenly Gate Formation," "Mu Kezhai," and "Marriage on Horseback," which were martial arts plays. To take his current requested salary of forty thousand yuan, that is simply fifty times more than when he first came to Shanghai. However, since he was subordinate to Xiaoyun at that time, he could only play the unimportant Lady Gan. In addition, there were also the old retainer Li Lianzhong's Zhang Fei, Chuan Xiaoshan's Xiahou En, and Xu Deyi's Cao Ba Generals, all of whom were the best choices of the time. As for the role of Cao Cao, it is a pity that I cannot remember whether it was played by Da Liqi (Shoushan). When "Han Jin Ferry" was performed, the living Guan Gong, San Mazi, played Yun Chang. As soon as he appeared on stage, the applause was thunderous. Although Hongshou's Guan opera was slightly different from the Beijing style, some in the Beijing and Korean factions criticized it for being excessive. However, he was ultimately grounded in martial arts and came from a prominent family. Not only was he knowledgeable, but he also learned the authentic traditions from famous teachers in all the famous plays of the Hui Opera, such as "Killing Jing Tang," "Running the City," and "Sweeping Pine Trees and Writing Letters," and was unique in the northern and southern opera circles. Therefore, his portrayal of the role of Yun Chang, his appearance and skills, can be said to be unmatched in his time. Let me cite one thing, although it is a minor detail, it also shows his high level of insight. When he retired from the opera stage in his later years, he once warned his disciples, including Lin Shusen, etc.: "When playing the role of Lord, never make the cuffs of the shoulder pads too narrow, or tighten the belt too tightly, because that would make it look too stylish and too beautiful. Playing the role of Lord requires a generous, dignified, and solemn attitude, which is of course different from the way Ma Chao and Zhao Yun are played." When Li Hongchun first arrived in Shanghai, Shusen told Li about his late master's last words after watching the play. Hongchun changed it the next day, which also shows the loyalty of their master and brothers. In summary, regarding this "Battle of Changban Slope," the above-mentioned supporting roles seem to be easy to find in the Beijing Grand Free Opera, but only San Mazi, that old gentleman, often performed in Shanghai. Without this living Guan Gong in Beijing, it would certainly not enhance the color of "Han Jin Ferry." In other words, it is not enough to enhance the value of Zhao Yun in Xiaolou's complete "Battle of Changban Slope." That's why I said that this "Battle of Changban Slope" was indeed a famous drama that was unmatched in its time, and the Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Zhao in the drama were all first-class good actors.

### Shirley Temple Officially Enrolls in School

— Jingyuan

Ten-year-old Shirley Temple has officially enrolled in school after finishing filming the colorful art film "The Blue Bird"—this should be said to be a major change in Shirley Temple's private life.

In the past, her education was taught by her mother and home tutors, but now, her parents, George and Gertrude, have sent her into a new environment where she studies and plays with many girls of the same age.

The school Shirley Temple is attending is the private Westlake School for Girls in Beverly Hills, Hollywood, a well-known aristocratic elementary school in Los Angeles, just a few minutes' walk from her home. She is currently a seventh grader, studying subjects including dancing, art, singing, and other basic courses. In the next year, she will also have to learn cooking, sewing, and the skills that a housewife must know, which her mother decided to choose after much consideration.

Indeed, Shirley Temple is different from before. She practices knitting woolen sweaters at home on Saturdays and Sundays, or when she has free time on the film set. The principal of Westlake School for Girls, Miss Laguna, said: "Shirley is really a smart child. She can memorize a hymn called 'The Processional' after singing it for two weeks." Perhaps, Shirley Temple's chances of appearing on the screen in the future will decrease, but fans all hope that she can continue to make movies.

### Leisure Books and the Entertainment World (29): Book Opera

— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Xiuyan

"Book opera" is more commonly called "makeup ballad singing."

The lyrics, dialogues, scripts, and expressions are all based on the original ballad, and the performers are all ballad singers who usually tune and compose.

Performances are limited to the time of "book meetings" held at the end of the year, and are rarely performed at other times. However, the intonation and modulation of ballads are suitable for sitting and singing, but not for performance. A generation of ballad singers is usually accustomed to "sitting and singing." Once they put on makeup and go on stage, they are often at a loss. Therefore, the performance of book opera inevitably leaves the criticism of being "neither fish nor fowl."

### Act One of "Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom" (Performance at Lafayette)
