### Hong Kong Border Blockade Issue: British-Japanese Negotiations Reportedly Broken Down; British Women and Children Remaining in Hong Kong Scheduled for Complete Evacuation Today; Authorities Determined to Complete Evacuation Plan with Mandatory Registration

Hong Kong - Today, Hong Kong experienced heavy rain all day, and the city was calm. British women and children are scheduled to be completely evacuated by the fifth. So far, only over two thousand have registered, far from the expected number. Generally, people believe the situation has gradually calmed down, hence the reluctance to evacuate. However, the Hong Kong government is determined to complete the evacuation plan and will implement mandatory registration. Passenger traffic on ships traveling between Hong Kong and Shanghai, Hong Kong and Macau, and Hong Kong and the Philippines is exceptionally crowded. Both flights by Pan American Airways are fully booked, and over a hundred people are still without reservations. Although Japanese troops have been closing the Hong Kong border since the 3rd, vegetables are still being smuggled into British territory. The Japanese army can only handle the three locations of Lo Wu, Man Kam To, and Sha Tau Kok. The new Governor, Sir Geoffrey Northcote, is expected to arrive in Hong Kong by the end of the month. It is Britain's consistent policy to have military personnel oversee key regional affairs, demonstrating the British determination to defend Hong Kong. (4th Dispatch)

All evacuation matters for tomorrow are fully prepared. The embarkation of over two thousand women and children should be orderly. The government guarantees the comfort of the evacuees during the journey, as evidenced by the notice that two Chang Hing Company postal ships have been chartered for this purpose. The Russian Queen is expected to arrive tonight. The Japanese Queen, which carried the first batch of evacuees to Manila, is also expected to return here tomorrow morning. It is expected that the total number of people evacuated from Hong Kong to Manila will reach 9,000. (4th Reuters Dispatch)

Editorial

### The International Situation in the Eyes of the British and Americans

We do not feel that Britain is aging. Especially after the end of the Western Front battles, we feel that its spirit is vigorous and its power is pervasive. In matters as significant as deciding to continue fighting alone, and as minor as deciding to evacuate women and children from Hong Kong as quickly as possible, it acts decisively and relentlessly, demonstrating its strength and determination. However, are these expressions only because it has been stimulated by direct and immediate practical interests? From a certain perspective, observing certain points, it seems that some British ideas reveal a tendency towards aging. At least, regarding international movements, the British judgments and aspirations have become mechanized in their approach due to their traditional successes. We should not ask: why do Stalin, Hitler, and Mussolini not follow established norms? But we cannot help but ask: Chamberlain, immersed in the British tradition of passing on the mantle and preserving orthodoxy, isn't his approach outdated? It's not just Chamberlain. A few words from a New York dispatch in the London Daily Telegraph the day before yesterday: "Although the interests of the Soviet Union and Japan in the Far East are irreconcilable, democratic countries may temporarily benefit from it, but fundamentally, doomed powers, including other dictatorships, will eventually collude." This is not New York news; it is a purely British idea. Similarly, a few words from a New York dispatch in the London Times on the same day: "If the Soviet Union and Germany clash, Japan will quickly move towards the Axis powers and seek to seize or blockade Vladivostok, the Soviet Union's access to the Pacific Ocean. If the Soviet Union and Germany continue to cooperate, Tokyo will be apprehensive and attempt to improve its relations with Britain and the United States." This is also definitely not information from New York; it is a truly traditional British idea. Ideas are not very capable of being based on objective reason; rather, they are often a synthesis of subjective judgments and aspirations. When the British have such ideas, that is, when they make such judgments and aspirations, we cannot help but feel that this is the mechanized approach of the British tradition. The method in his diplomatic history has repeatedly achieved consummation, the mechanized judgment to the present, the mechanized aspiration to the present. But he was wrong!

The irreconcilable nature of the Soviet Union and Japan in the Far East is a public phenomenon. In the past, after Japan forcibly occupied China's Northeast, did the strategists in its government and public first fight the Soviet Union and then covet China, or did they first take China and then fight the Soviet Union? It can be seen that the irreconcilable nature has been long-standing. So why still fear their collusion? Germany and Italy are allies, and they are currently fighting side by side. What contradictions exist between them, we will not speculate for now. As for the Soviet Union and Germany, during Germany's war against Britain, the Soviet Union would certainly not help Britain to the detriment of Germany, and Germany would especially not intensify friction with the Soviet Union. However, the mutual goodwill has its inevitable limits. The more Germany dominates in Europe, the more the Soviet Union and Germany will be on guard against each other. So why also fear their collusion? As for Japan, between the Soviet Union and Germany, because the long-term Sino-Japanese war has deprived Japan of its strength to participate in the Axis powers, and because the European war has deprived Japan of its opportunity to manipulate events from the middle due to the fact that the Soviet Union and Germany will never turn against each other, not only has Japan lost favor with the Soviet Union and Germany, but the Soviet Union and Germany both harbor resentment towards Japan. So why say that these four countries will eventually collude? I believe that the United States wants to sympathize with and support Britain for various reasons, but not because of the British traditional diplomatic idea that someone will collude. Even if "the Soviet Union and Germany clash," Japan will not only definitely not move its remaining forces towards Vladivostok and engage in the so-called seizure or blockade, but will also move the remaining forces at the Soviet-Japanese border towards China. Even if "Tokyo is apprehensive because Germany and the Soviet Union continue to cooperate" and "attempts to improve its relations with Britain and the United States," this would indeed be beneficial to Britain during Britain's war against Germany, but has Britain also planned for this? What price is Britain prepared to pay today in order to obtain Japan's goodwill? Does reality allow it? In short, the era of British diplomacy has passed, and the traditional diplomatic ideas have failed. In the Far East, if it does not want to abandon, it can only resolve to defend itself. Regarding international movements, Americans see more clearly than the British and grasp more firmly. For example, the New York Post, the representative newspaper of the US government party, commented yesterday: "Not only the democratic countries, but also Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union, must oppose any attempt by Japan to control the entire Far East. Japan may make some progress temporarily, but when the European war ends, no matter who wins, Japan will eventually have to yield." We completely agree with this conclusion and believe it can serve as a lesson for the British!

### Stimson and Knox's Statements Outline the Course of US Far East Policy; Implementing Neutrality Will Lead to Shameful Consequences; The US Reaches Understanding with Britain Due to Strategic Relations

Washington - People here believe that the Tokyo newspapers' report of British-American naval cooperation is due to Japanese concern over the future actions of the American fleet. The only possible reaction from official circles here is that the report is inaccurate. However, this statement only creates an inaccurate impression of the United States' position on the Far East issue. In fact, the State Department has not changed its policy of opposing the Japanese attempt to establish a new order in the Far East. In terms of Atlantic or Pacific naval strategy, what the United States must consider is the possible hostile actions of the Japanese fleet on the one hand and the friendliness obtained by the British fleet on the other, and to adjust its plans accordingly. The result is almost equivalent to Britain and the United States reaching an informal understanding. (4th Reuters Dispatch)

Appointment to the Cabinet to be Voted On

Washington - Since the Senate committee passed the appointments of Colonel Stimson and Colonel Knox as Secretary of War and Secretary of the Navy, the Senate prepared last night to submit the move of adding the two men to President Roosevelt's "new mixed cabinet" to a vote. It is widely believed that the Senate's final decision will be delayed until the end of next week because the Senate currently has countless important budget bills urgently awaiting a vote. The Senate Naval Affairs Committee passed a motion yesterday by a vote of nine to five to ask the Senate to confirm Colonel Knox's appointment. As for Colonel Stimson's appointment, it was approved on Tuesday in the Army Committee by a vote of fourteen to three. It is widely expected that the senators who believe that the two new cabinet members will adopt a crisis policy of assisting Britain will make a final opposition to the two colonels in the Senate. However, congressional figures believe that, in any case, the appointment of the two men will eventually be passed. After the Naval Affairs Committee passed Knox's appointment, Committee Chairman Walsh gave a speech praising the publisher of the Chicago newspaper (i.e., Knox), saying that he had "the determination to move forward and a deep understanding of the current situation." Walsh declared, "This committee believes that Colonel Knox has the determination to move forward and a deep understanding of the current situation, and will surely accelerate the rate of our country's naval construction." When the news of his appointment was received, the committee believed that Colonel Knox was a proponent of intervention, so the committee had a tendency to oppose Knox. After listening to the opinions, the committee learned that although Colonel Knox absolutely sympathized with the Allied powers in his opinions, he also declared that he did not advocate directly joining the European war. He advocated that the people could assist the Allied powers morally and economically, but he opposed this kind of economic assistance being carried out by the government. He declared that he opposed the government giving any assistance to other countries that could drag the United States into war or endanger the national defense of the United States. This has already been made clear in public to the committee. During the public hearing in the committee that day, someone asked Knox for his opinion on the country's neutrality law. Knox replied that he was "furious" about the implementation of the neutrality law on China and Japan, because if this case were implemented in the Sino-Japanese War, there would be a shameful consequence on the Far East issue. Isolationist Republican Senator Johnson repeatedly stated that this neutrality law was not implemented in the Far East because President Roosevelt did not recognize the state of war in that area and therefore refused to issue a formal announcement. Knox replied that he opposed the entire neutrality law and advocated returning to international law, but at the same time, he acknowledged that in the current situation, international law was "fragile." (4th United Press Dispatch)

Washington - The newly appointed Secretary of the Navy Knox and Secretary of War Stimson, expressed their opinions in the Senate's naval and military committees, stressing that America's new front line in the Atlantic, and making plain the course to be followed in US's new Far East policy. Among Knox's opinions, the Senate was most concerned about the fact that he did not believe that the United States could effectively prevent Japan from occupying the Dutch East Indies. Responsible naval figures believe that Knox's view is also true for Vietnam and the Philippines, and why not? Naval figures believe that Knox's remarks are sufficient to break the previous claims of the naval authorities that expanding US naval operations to Southeast Asia and using British Singapore as a base could defeat Japan. The development of the European War has made the defense of the Atlantic Ocean important, so the US's measures in the Far East must be very prudent. Both Knox and Stimson are proponents of a strong Far East policy, but at this time, both men believe that the implementation of the US Far East policy should be particularly prudent in light of the current world situation. For this reason, although the American official attitude is very dissatisfied with the recent visit of Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura to the Philippines, but an exceedingly circumspect one, and no comment has been issued.

Britain, Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union oppose exclusive domination

New York - The New York "Post" yesterday commented on Japan's recently published "East Asia Monroe Doctrine," calling it a "light opera" and urging the US government to ban the export of scrap iron to Japan, saying that it could prevent "our people from continuing to manufacture military supplies for the Japanese." The newspaper pointed out that Japan's declaration of the "Monroe Doctrine" and the implementation of the doctrine are two different things. The newspaper also said that not only democratic countries oppose the Japanese domination of the Far East, but also Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union. Japan may make some progress in the Far East temporarily, but the day will come when Japan will eventually yield, no matter which side wins the European war in the end. At the same time, the "New York Herald Tribune" pointed out that the United States needs tin and rubber produced in the British and Dutch Far East. The newspaper believes that this is the direct reason why the United States is concerned about Japan's current activities in the Far East. The newspaper also said that Japan's current actions are forcing the United States to "appease" Japan, just as the Rome-Berlin Axis did in Europe before. (4th United Press Dispatch)

Tokyo - Authoritative sources here recently stated that the Japanese military is currently planning to ask the government to adopt a strong foreign policy, based on Germany's current actions in Europe. Japanese Minister of War Shunroku Hata discussed with Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita yesterday the means of implementing Foreign Minister Arita's "East Asia Monroe Doctrine." Shunroku Hata also presented Hachiro Arita with the views of the Army authorities. After discussing with Arita, Shunroku Hata immediately convened senior military officers at the Ministry of the Army to report the results of his talks with the Foreign Minister. (4th United Press Dispatch)

Tokyo - A Japanese naval spokesman said that Japan does not feel pleased with the recent remarks by US Senate Naval Affairs Committee Chairman Walsh, who said that the US Navy may have difficulty defeating Japan without British and French cooperation. The spokesman said that the personal remarks of US senators have no impact on Japan's serious concern about the US naval construction program and its Far East policy. He said that Japan only focuses on concrete facts and actions and does not pay attention to empty words. When asked what was meant by "concrete actions," the spokesman enumerated various US actions, such as assisting the Chongqing government, which Japan viewed as improper interference in the Sino-Japanese War, and imposing various economic pressures on Japan. Regarding the speech given by the newly appointed US Secretary of the Navy Knox at the US Senate Naval Affairs Committee, the spokesman commented that it was unwise for the US to attempt to impose "improper interference" on the Far East, because Knox had said at the time that it would be unwise for the US to interfere in the Far East after France's defeat. Referring to Walsh's statement that the US fleet did not want to engage with Japan, the spokesman added, "Japan also does not want to fight with the United States and has no intention of provoking the US fleet, because the policy of the Japanese Navy is based on the principles of 'non-aggression' and 'non-threat.'" The spokesman also said that regarding the situation in Vietnam, although the French authorities have agreed to cut off the transportation of Chongqing's military supplies, it is still too early to comment. The spokesman also said that he could not comment on the incident in which the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Army prematurely announced Japan's "East Asia Monroe Doctrine" policy the previous week, because Japanese Foreign Minister Arita had announced this policy to the press a few days ago.

### British House of Commons Discusses Yangtze River Shipping

London - Conservative MP Maugham asked Foreign Undersecretary Butler in the House of Commons yesterday about the situation of British and other countries' ships using the Yangtze River upstream and downstream of Nanjing. Butler replied that the Yangtze River above Jiangyin is still blocked and foreign ships are not allowed to navigate. Below Jiangyin, British ships continue to navigate with some difficulties, which he had said on February 29. (4th Reuters Dispatch)

### England Will Reject Blockade Request for Burma Road; Singapore Takes Military Precautions; Japanese Surveillance Personnel Arrive in Hanoi

Tokyo - British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie visited Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Koya Masazumi at 10:00 this morning to inform him that the British government's reply regarding the transport of goods through Burma should arrive mid-week. It is reported that the British ambassador clarified the reason for the delay in the reply, stating that the British government had to consult with the governments of its dominions and colonies. (Reuters, 4th)

Tokyo - Regarding the Japanese request for Britain to blockade Burma to cut off the supply of military goods to Chongqing, Japan has not yet received a reply from Britain. The British ambassador also reportedly said that he has not received any instructions regarding the Japanese protest. The Japanese press is making various speculations about what kind of reply Britain will give, with most commentators believing that Britain's delayed reply will inevitably reject Japan's request. A Japanese Navy spokesman told the press that Japan is awaiting Britain's response with "serious concern and firm resolve," and that Japan has not yet received Britain's reply. The spokesman emphasized that prohibiting the import of munitions into Chongqing through Burma is an important prerequisite for dealing with the "China Incident." The spokesman also said that the Japanese people are paying close attention to Britain's delayed response, and that this action is sufficient to arouse the resentment of the Japanese people. Regarding the evacuation of women and children from Hong Kong, the spokesman said that most Japanese people believe that this move by Britain is a common trick to attract the attention of the United States in order to achieve its own goals. The spokesman said that he somewhat agrees with this view. (Associated Press, 4th)

London - Japanese officials here claimed last night that the Japanese government has formally assured Britain that Japan's New East Asia "Monroe Doctrine" does not intend to include Australia within Japan's sphere of control. It is reported that Japan has informed Britain that the "highest end point of Japan's mission of stability" is the Caroline and Marshall Islands in the South Pacific. Reliable sources here confirm reports that Britain intends to reject Japan's request to blockade the Yunnan-Burma Railway, but officials deny reports that British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie has already submitted Britain's reply to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. This area is preparing to resist any Japanese forward movements at the expense of Britain. It is believed here that Japan intends to invade French Indochina, and it is suspected that Japan will not encounter serious resistance from France during the attack. It seems too early for Britain to hope that the appointment of Sir Stafford Cripps as the new British Ambassador to the Soviet Union will improve Anglo-Soviet relations. Even the beginning of the improvement of bilateral relations, a barter agreement, has lost interest in both here and Moscow. (Associated Press, 4th)

Stockholm - It has been learned here that Singapore and the Malay Archipelago recently took special military precautions. All neutral ships, unless they have special permits, are not allowed to enter Malay ports. Some ports are completely closed. Even with special permits, entry is not allowed. Although Singapore is recognized as the strongest port in the world, due to the seriousness of the situation in the Far East, it has had to increase its defenses. These measures should not be seen as a result of feeling a "direct threat." (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Hanoi - More than 30 Japanese civilian and military officials responsible for monitoring the blockade of Vietnam arrived here recently. These inspectors arrived on three Douglas aircraft and were welcomed by French civilian and military authorities at the airport before being escorted to hotels in Hanoi. (Associated Press, 4th)

Tokyo - According to sources from the Japanese side in Hanoi, the personnel sent by the Japanese government to Vietnam to monitor the cessation of transit of important government military supplies through Vietnam have begun their work. The French authorities are now cooperating sincerely. After the French government accepted Japan's proposal, the first group of these personnel arrived in Haiphong on a Japanese warship. The second group, led by Navy Commander Motoi, arrived in Haiphong on Tuesday. Another group arrived in Hanoi on Wednesday afternoon. (Reuters, 4th)

An alert was issued at 11:00 AM, when it was heard that several waves of Japanese planes were heading towards Chongqing. It was initially thought that they were flying to Chengdu or Jiading, as it was seen that all the planes were heading west along the Chengdu highway. However, at around 2:30 PM, the planes suddenly turned east and headed towards Chongqing. At exactly 3:00 PM, they flew over Xindu and dropped bombs in the western district, focusing on the university district. Central University in the district has been bombed twice. Yesterday, five waves of Japanese planes flew west towards Chongqing, but due to bad weather, they dropped bombs near Fuling in eastern Sichuan. According to reports received here, Japanese bombers from Hankou flew out on June 30, but due to heavy rain along the way, they failed to reach Chongqing and only dropped bombs in Badong. In addition, Xi'an was recently attacked by bombers flying from Shanxi. (Reuters, 4th)

Chongqing - Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao recently told the press that as the Japanese are moving closer to Chongqing's supply lines, the National Government is making every effort to achieve self-sufficiency. The purpose of China's economic policy is self-sufficiency. Since the capital moved west, the government has issued many laws and regulations to improve and support the production of the rich inland provinces. This is the reason why the government is spending a lot of money to embark on huge production projects. At the same time, the government has also provided economic and technical assistance to private enterprises. (Associated Press, 4th)

### British Navy Attacks French Fleet at Mers-el-Kébir; Deploys Electric Mines to Sever Sea Routes; French Battleship Explodes After Hitting Mine

Berlin - It is reported that yesterday at 5:50 PM, the British fleet suddenly opened fire on French warships anchored in Mers-el-Kébir. The French battleships Dunkerque and Provence, and the fleet's flagship Mogador, were hit and caught fire. The battleship Bretagne caught fire and sailed out of the port, but unfortunately hit an electric mine and exploded. However, the battleship Strasbourg and five small ships, several torpedo boats, and submarines were able to fight back effectively, break through the blockade, and reach the Mediterranean. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Geneva - This morning, an official French statement stated that on the morning of July 3, several British warships appeared near the Mers-el-Kébir naval base. The British admiral demanded that French Fleet Commander Admiral Gensoul surrender or sink the French fleet, and gave them six hours to decide. However, before the six-hour deadline, the British Navy deployed electric mines to sever the sea routes. After the French refused the above request, the British opened fire on the French warships at 5:40 PM. Therefore, the French government ordered the French ships near the British warships in Alexandria to weigh anchor and sail to international waters, even if it meant using force. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

London - The Ministry of Information announced that in order to ensure that the French fleet would not be used against Britain, steps were taken on the morning of July 3 to place all French ships docked in British ports under British control. This action proceeded smoothly, with only two people injured due to a misunderstanding. At the same time, Britain also made some demands on the French ships docked in North African ports, with the aim of preventing them from falling into German hands, and explained to the French officers commanding the ships that if these conditions could not be accepted, Britain was prepared to take all possible steps to ensure that the ships would not be used to fight against Britain in future wars. The British government expressed its regret that the French naval commander at Mers-el-Kébir refused to accept any of the conditions proposed. As a result, Britain was forced to take action against the French ships there. This action is currently underway. The Prime Minister will make a statement on this matter in the House of Commons today. Mers-el-Kébir is a French naval station in Algiers. According to the estimate of a naval expert, the French Navy ranks second in Europe. Currently, the total number of its main warships is over 180. At the time of the outbreak of the war, its active warships included five battleships, including the Dunkerque and Strasbourg. Before the new 35,000-ton battleships were built in Britain and France, these two ships were the fastest and most modern battleships in the world. There are seven 10,000-ton cruisers equipped with 8-inch guns, twelve "B-class cruisers with a displacement of 6,000 to 8,000 tons and equipped with 6-inch guns, thirty-two small cruisers with a displacement of 3,000 tons, thirty-eight destroyers, thirty-seven escort ships and similar small ships, seventy-seven submarines, including thirty ocean-going submarines, one aircraft carrier and one seaplane carrier, and a large number of auxiliary ships. The French Navy had not suffered much loss before the Mers-el-Kébir incident. In this incident, the French lost seven destroyers. In addition, the first paragraph of the Ministry of Information's statement stated, "We will remember that the French government trusted the promises made by Germany and Italy that the French fleet would not be used to attack their former allies. In the armistice agreement, especially regarding the surrender of the French fleet to the enemy, the British government has completely lost confidence in the promises made by the German and Italian governments, and feels that for its own interests and the hope of restoring France's independence and the integrity of the French Empire, it has no choice but to take timely steps to ensure that the French fleet will not be used by a common enemy to fight against Britain."

Prime Minister Announces Details of Naval Battle

London - This afternoon, Prime Minister Winston Churchill explained to the House of Commons the British Navy's plan to prevent the French fleet from falling into German hands. The Prime Minister said, "Yesterday, we unanimously decided to place the larger part of the French fleet under our control, or to use considerable force to make them comply with our conditions." There were two battleships, two light cruisers, several submarines, eight destroyers, and two hundred small minesweepers and anti-submarine ships in the ports of Plymouth and Portsmouth. After notifying the commanders of these ships, we boarded the ships shortly thereafter." The Prime Minister continued, "I must announce with sincere sorrow that Britain had no choice but to find a way to prevent the French fleet from coming under Nazi control. The French government has abandoned the war and placed the entire burden on the shoulders of the British Empire, and it is difficult to expect them to be cautious and not inflict unnecessary damage on their loyal comrades. The only chance for French freedom lies in the final victory of this comrade." The Prime Minister then recounted the conditions that Britain had proposed, such as sending the French fleet to British ports before signing an armistice agreement, which would completely release them from their treaty obligations, but France did not follow through. Admiral Darlan (Commander-in-Chief of the French Fleet) made various statements and even declared one time, but the signed armistice agreement still stipulated that the strength of the French fleet and the part under British control should be placed under German control. At that time, many French ships, unable to reach African ports, sailed into the ports of Plymouth and Portsmouth ten days ago.

The Prime Minister continued, "I must state that the Bordeaux government has inflicted fatal damage on us. They are well aware of the consequences. We are still subjected to a ruthless or even malicious treatment, but this does not come from the French nation (cheers), but from the Bordeaux government. For example, the French had captured more than 400 German airmen, and Reynaud had even handed them over to Britain, but after the Reynaud government fell, they were all handed over to Germany." The Prime Minister continued, "Part of the French fleet anchored at Mers-el-Kébir in Algeria refused to be controlled by Britain to prevent it from falling into German hands, resulting in a battle with the British fleet. In this battle, at least four French ships were sunk, and two others were damaged. Two of the best French warships, the Dunkerque and Strasbourg, several light cruisers, destroyers, submarines, and other various warships were anchored at and near Mers-el-Kébir. Yesterday morning, the French admiral refused to meet with a British officer who went to discuss the status of the French fleet. The officer then presented the fleet with a document, asking them to continue fighting against Germany and Italy. We would then sail to a British port with a reduced number of personnel. If these conditions were not accepted, they were ordered to scuttle their ships within six hours. A British detachment, commanded by Admiral Somerville, went to Mers-el-Kébir, consisting of cruisers and other powerful warships. The admiral had previously helped rescue 100,000 French soldiers in the Battle of Dunkirk. When the French admiral finally rejected the British demands, Admiral Somerville was ordered to complete his task before dark. He then opened fire on the powerful French fleet at 5:58 PM. The French fleet was defended by coastal batteries. The British attack was supplemented by fierce attacks from the air. By 7:50 PM, a French battlecruiser of the Strasbourg class had been damaged, a battleship of the Bretagne class had been sunk, and another had been heavily damaged. Two French destroyers and an aircraft carrier were either sunk or set on fire. The Strasbourg or Dunkerque then sailed out of the port and was pursued by planes. Although a torpedo hit it, it was able to enter Toulon Harbor before being subdued, with the help of other French ships." The Prime Minister concluded, "I fear that there must have been many lives lost among the French fleet and in the port, as the British ships were forced to use the most drastic measures against them and witnessed violent explosions."

The diplomatic corps seats were full during the Prime Minister's speech. Many diplomats were in attendance, including Soviet Ambassador Maisky and Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi. The audience cheered as the Prime Minister entered the chamber. After the Prime Minister finished his speech, the House of Commons held a closed session. (Reuters, 4th)

London - Details of how the French ships docked in British ports were brought under British control were released this afternoon. It is reported that early yesterday morning, British naval forces went to the various French ships docked in a port in southern England and other places where French soldiers were stationed, and detained the French. Some French ships were heard cheering. Many officers were evidently moved by the "capture" of their warships and the circumstances that led to this step. (Reuters, 4th)

French Warships Ordered to Fight for Freedom of Navigation

Geneva - French warships docked in Alexandria have been ordered by the French government to weigh anchor as soon as possible, and if necessary, use force to fight for freedom of navigation. French warships currently in international waters have been ordered to retaliate if attacked by the British again. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Hitler Allows French Ships to Be Scuttled

Berlin - After learning that some French warships could not escape British control, Führer Hitler has allowed the French government to scuttle these warships to prevent them from falling into enemy hands and increasing future troubles. It is believed here that this approach does not contradict the armistice agreement, as Germany has stated in advance that it has no intention of occupying French warships, but if it wants to prevent these warships from fighting against Germany in the future, then removing the problem at its root is justifiable. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

### East African War: Italian Forces' Attack Unsuccessful

Nairobi - Officials announced that there was no activity by the army on the entire front yesterday. On Tuesday, British planes attacked Italian defenses in the Moyale area again, bombing their artillery positions and strafing their machine gun posts. Enemy reinforcements hiding in a small valley were also strafed. Explosions were heard, and it is believed that the arsenal had been destroyed. It is now known that the Italian forces' first attack on Monday, after firing three hundred and fifty shells at a British outpost, was repelled by British forces, with significant assistance from British planes. (Reuters, 4th)

London - Responsible sources describe the recent British attack on the Italian forces in Mitama, East Africa, as follows: "One British company and some Abyssinian irregulars attacked a large Italian detachment. Only one British soldier was killed and ten were wounded. No machine guns were lost. The Italians lost three times as many, including three Italian officers." According to a previous announcement from Rome, the British left sixty bodies and abandoned weapons and machine guns, while the Italians suffered minimal losses. (Reuters, 4th)

### Germany Refuses to Conclude Alliance Treaty with Romania, Striving to Avoid Conflict with the Soviet Union; Leader of Romanian National Party Organizes New Cabinet

Bucharest: Romania's desire to immediately obtain German support to deal with its neighbors (especially Hungary and Bulgaria, which are oppressing Romania to return its former territories) has become a pipe dream after the German Minister's hurried trip to Berlin today. According to reliable sources, the German Minister came with orders from the German government, notifying the Romanian side that Germany is currently unable to conclude an alliance treaty with Romania or provide military assistance. The general impression here is that Germany is eager to avoid any actions that could provoke conflict with the Soviet Union. According to a German news agency, the Romanian government resigned today. General Ghiță Racoviță, Minister Without Portfolio of the Tătărescu Cabinet, has been appointed to organize the new cabinet and is currently discussing candidates in the Royal Palace. (Reuters, 4th)

Bucharest: This morning, after Romanian Prime Minister Tătărescu and all cabinet members submitted their resignations, the King entrusted the responsibility of forming a cabinet to Gigurtu, leader of the National Party. The organization of the new cabinet is currently under discussion. Mr. Gigurtu once served as Foreign Minister. (Haitong Telegram, 4th)

Bucharest: Today, Romanian military leaders promulgated 30 articles of regulations to maintain public order and prepare for war. In addition to confirming the curfew regulations stipulated by the Public Security Bureau, prohibiting gatherings, and carrying firearms and weapons, they advised the people to assist the authorities in promoting various air defense measures and regulations, and to assist soldiers in eliminating enemy paratroopers landing from the air. Violators will be severely punished. (Haitong Telegram, 4th)

Bucharest: Soviet officials here speculate that the Balkan countries have recently notified Germany and Italy, informing them that these countries have agreed to consider a plan to cede a small part of Transylvania to Hungary and southern Dobruja to Bulgaria, and to have Greece cede a passage to the Aegean Sea for Bulgaria. (United Press, 4th)

Romanian Prime Minister Submits Resignation to the King

Bucharest: It is generally expected that after Prime Minister Tătărescu delivers an important speech in the Chamber of Deputies, he will submit his resignation to King Carol II and form a new cabinet to adapt to the current pro-German policies. The political circles here are now focused on Germany's attitude, but the German government has not yet made any statement regarding guaranteeing Romania's security. There are rumors that the Soviet Union will make new demands to the Romanian authorities, but this has not been confirmed. (Havas, 3rd)

Bucharest: Romanian Prime Minister Tătărescu delivered a speech yesterday to the Foreign Affairs Committees of both the Upper and Lower Houses, stating, "Romania will respectfully fulfill its obligations to the Soviet Union, but we must solemnly declare that Bessarabia and Bukovina, along with their populations, belong to Romania. The judgment of future history will prove our words to be true." Mr. Tătărescu stated that the Romanian government accepted the cession of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina in order to preserve Romania's survival and avoid endangering the future of the Romanian people. As a result of this move, Romania must change its foreign policy and adopt a new direction. (Haitong Telegram, 4th)

Soviet Experts Arrive in Bessarabia

Moscow: Soviet experts have arrived in Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina and have begun work on restoring railways and waterways. The railways from Kischinev to Basarabeasca, Bender, and Ungheni have been restored. At the same time, water traffic on the Dniester River will also be restored soon. (TASS, 3rd)

Moscow: The extent of damage to the railways in Northern Bukovina after the withdrawal of Romanian troops was extremely severe, but Soviet personnel have quickly repaired them. The railway junction at Cernăuți has been repaired, and trains from Lviv to Cernăuți have been running since the 30th of last month. (TASS, 3rd)

Moscow: Officials here announced yesterday that after the Soviet People's Commissar for Defense, Timoshenko, and the Secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party, Khrushchev, arrived in Budeni, Bessarabia, they proceeded to Kishinev. (Haitong Telegram, 4th)

Romania's Military Preparedness Further Intensified

Bucharest: After the government ordered nationwide military alert last night in order to cope with possible invasions, the situation in Romania became tense again. The government announced that the military commander of the Bucharest region has ordered the capital to take special military precautions. The government radio advised the people to be vigilant against enemy paratroopers, but the government did not specify from which direction the enemy was attacking, because both Bulgaria and Hungary have made territorial demands on Romania. Before the government announced this new military measure, both houses of parliament had adjourned. Before the adjournment, all members stood silently with bowed heads for several minutes of silent prayer. The government did not indicate when parliament would reconvene, but it is widely believed that the government will exercise dictatorial powers during the emergency period in the Balkans. Romanian officials last night refused to confirm reports that an important Romanian representative had flown to meet with Führer Hitler, and that the government had communicated with Prime Minister Mussolini. Signs of political discord within Romania grew last night. Unconfirmed reports said that the government had decided to hold negotiations with Bulgaria and Hungary, based on the agreement between the Soviet Union and Romania, in order to seek a peaceful resolution. As a result, political unrest has increased. The report said that the borders would be determined by negotiations, and the affected residents would mutually relocate. Senior military sources said that the Hungarian troops who opened fire on Romanian soldiers on the Romanian border on Tuesday had retreated back into Hungary, leaving seventy bodies. It is widely believed that the Hungarian troops withdrew because they received orders from their government, as diplomatic efforts to prevent the Balkan war had recently made progress. Furthermore, some military leaders believed that the attacks on Romanian territory were aimed at obtaining information about Romania's defense capabilities. The Hungarian raiding party was ambushed and annihilated by Romanian troops. At noon yesterday, bells tolled throughout Bucharest to mark the shame of Romania's submission to the Soviet Union, and flags were flown at half-mast. The government last night denied reports that Romania had proposed holding a European conference in Rome to resolve various outstanding issues in the Balkans. (United Press, 4th)

Bucharest: The Romanian Ministry of Finance has allocated 10 million lei (Romanian currency) to the Minister of the Interior, specifically for the relief of refugees in Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. It is reported that the Romanian government plans to continue allocating large sums to assist displaced immigrants in the future. (Haitong Telegram, 4th)

Romanian Aircraft Appear in Bulgarian Airspace

Bucharest: According to the Bulgarian Embassy, several Romanian aircraft appeared over the Bulgarian town of Ruse the night before last. Bulgarian anti-aircraft artillery opened fire, and the aircraft retreated towards Romanian territory. Ruse is located across the Danube River, opposite the Romanian town of Giurgiu. (Haitong Telegram, 4th)

Hungarian Authorities Deny Border Clashes

Budapest: Regarding rumors circulating abroad that Hungarian military troops have attacked Romania, authoritative sources here yesterday strongly denied this, stating that Hungary has never concentrated troops on the Romanian border, nor have any border clashes occurred. Authoritative sources urged the public not to believe these malicious rumors. (Haitong Telegram, 4th)

### German Aircraft Bomb London All Day Long; Reportedly British Aircraft Carrier Hit by Torpedo; Five German Bombers Shot Down

London: Yesterday, multiple German aircraft continuously bombed London, relentlessly from dawn until dusk. (United Press, 4th)

Hitler's Headquarters: This afternoon, the German military report stated that German submarines fired torpedoes, hitting the British state-of-the-art aircraft carrier "Illustrious." Yesterday, German bombers attacked fortresses, airfields, aircraft factories, and docks along the English Channel and the British North Sea coast. As a result of the German aircraft's attack on a British escort fleet, a large ship was hit by two bombs. Yesterday, British aircraft, using the cover of floating clouds, attacked civilians in western and northern Germany. Eleven women and children and one man were killed, and twenty women and children were seriously injured. A total of six enemy aircraft were destroyed, and four German aircraft were missing. (Haitong Telegram, 4th)

London: The Air Ministry Information Office stated that enemy aircraft continuously attacked England and Scotland yesterday during the day, and British fighters shot down five of their bombers and damaged four others. German aircraft dropped bombs hastily and fled. Most German aircraft flew alone to the English coast. Three Spitfire British aircraft, while patrolling the east coast, saw two Dornier "Do 17" German bombers and attacked one of them, seeing it crash into the sea. The second German aircraft was also severely damaged and fled through the clouds. Subsequently, a third German aircraft was damaged by a British fighter. Furthermore, British aircraft attacked a German aircraft off the coast of Aberdeenshire, and the German aircraft resisted stubbornly before crashing into the sea. The British aircraft pilot saw the German crew launch two rubber boats to escape. A Junkers Ju 88 German bomber was shot down into the sea off the coast of Scotland, and three crew members escaped in a rubber boat. Two Spitfire British aircraft, while patrolling the southeastern coast, shot down another Dornier "Do 17" German aircraft. A Hurricane British fighter damaged a Heinkel He 111 German aircraft over the English Channel and hit its rear gunner. The German aircraft then fled through the clouds. Another squadron of Spitfire British aircraft attacked a Dornier aircraft off the east coast. The aircraft was severely damaged and fled into the clouds. Last night, a Spitfire British aircraft flew out to sea to intercept a German aircraft, and six minutes later, the German aircraft was hit and caught fire before crashing. (Reuters, 4th)

London: The Ministry of Home Security announced that the enemy aircraft that crossed the southern coast of England this morning dropped a small number of bombs, seemingly not aimed at any specific target. It is now known that only two people suffered minor injuries. Yesterday afternoon, enemy aircraft bombed southeastern London, and one house was set on fire by an incendiary bomb. It is not yet known if there were any injuries. One bomb in a garden destroyed the front of a house, and two other bombs fell in the adjacent streets. Other bombs fell in open fields and at sea. One town saw an enemy aircraft fly low and disappear into the sea. Residents saw the enemy aircraft drop bombs. Furthermore, in a village in southeastern England, a group of workers had four bombs drop nearby. One of them was a time-delay bomb. One worker died and three were injured. (Reuters, 4th)

### France to Convene National Assembly to Discuss Constitutional Amendments; Government to Request Special Powers from Parliament

Vichy, France: According to well-informed sources here, the two houses of parliament will submit a resolution to convene a National Assembly, that is, a joint session of the two houses of parliament, for voting during the next session. After this armistice, the current constitution needs to be amended in light of the new situation. This issue concerns the future of the country and must be discussed by a National Assembly. (Havas, 3rd)

Vichy: According to semi-official sources, the French government plans to convene parliament to amend the constitution. The government will request necessary powers from parliament to draft a new constitution for France under the authority of Marshal Pétain. The amendments will be made within the framework of republican principles and existing national laws. The new constitution must be approved by parliament or elected representatives replacing the current parliament. Marshal Pétain and his colleagues are now determined to break with convention on how much representation the vocational sector will retain. If France is to recover after its defeat, it must immediately adopt a resolute plan. Parliament must assist the government in improving the entire structure of French administration. The new constitution will guarantee the rights of the family and the homeland. Public opinion will be consistent with parliament in acknowledging that national reconstruction cannot be achieved without the continuous exercise of executive power. Hereafter, merit and intelligence must replace favoritism and bureaucracy, which have harmed the country. The nature of the new constitution will be courageous and novel, restoring national sovereignty and power to the country. (Reuters, 4th)

Geneva: The French cabinet met yesterday. Marshal Pétain, General Weygand, Laval, and Marchand attended to discuss plans for the new French constitution. Another cabinet meeting will be held this afternoon, chaired by President Lebrun himself. It is expected that the government's plan will be announced within days. (Haitong Telegram, 4th)

### US Senate Naval Affairs Committee Passes New Naval Bill; Stipulates Increase of More Than 200 Ships; Roosevelt to Continue Submitting Military Expansion Proposals

Washington: The United States Navy Department signed the final contract yesterday, increasing the strength of the United States fleet by 11 percent. However, the Senate Naval Affairs Committee yesterday unanimously passed a new naval bill, increasing the strength of the United States fleet to 70 percent. The Senate Naval Affairs Committee passed the new bill yesterday after only one hour of closed-door review. During the review, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark attended to explain the need to increase the number of warships to 750. The new naval bill stipulates the addition of more than 200 United States warships. The strength of the United States fleet after construction will be greater than the combined fleets of Britain and Japan today. Given current shipbuilding facilities, the shipbuilding process will take five to seven years to complete. After the new warships are built, the United States will have an independent Atlantic fleet. The shipbuilding project will cost US$4 billion. President Roosevelt is preparing to request Congress to allocate US$5 billion early next week to meet the needs of supplementing defense programs. Of this, US$4 billion is to mechanize the United States Army, and the other US$1 billion is to build other warships. The Army Department expects the United States Army's rearmament program to be completed in the early autumn of 1941. The goal of the rearmament program is to accumulate 50,000 first-line fighters and to mechanize defense equipment. General Pershing, commander of the United States Expeditionary Force during World War I, sent a letter to Congress yesterday, urging Congress to enact a law mandating compulsory military training in the United States. Pershing claimed that adopting this plan is "a decisive factor in keeping the United States out of the whirlpool of war." Before the Great War, if the United States had a military training program, it would have prevented the United States from sending untrained soldiers to France to participate in the war. This program could have saved the lives of thousands of American soldiers during the war. (United Press, 4th)

Washington: The U.S. Navy Department has recently ordered three aircraft carriers and two destroyers. All the warships that Congress has recently allocated funds to build have now been ordered. (Reuters, 4th)

### Large Quantities of American Goods Stagnant in Vietnam

Hong Kong: More than 6,000 tons of American goods, including airplanes, gasoline, air raid bombs, machinery, transport vehicles, and various accessories, are currently stagnant in Vietnam. In addition, a similar quantity of non-military goods is also prohibited from being transported to Guangdong via Hong Kong due to the emergency situation in Hong Kong. The routes in Vietnam via Haiphong, as well as the routes from Guangdong to Hong Kong, were previously used to export tungsten ore and tung oil to Hong Kong, which were then shipped to the United States to continue paying off U.S. loans to China. Large quantities of kerosene from the United States were transported from Sha Uk Tsuen, 30 miles northeast of Hong Kong, into the interior of Guangdong. However, Hong Kong is now completely isolated from the interior of Guangdong. The Japanese army's goal in blockading Hong Kong is to seriously affect Hong Kong's commerce, because despite the ongoing wars in China and Europe, Hong Kong's exports and imports have been booming, breaking past records. Furthermore, before the Japanese army landed in Shenzhen on June 22, a state-owned Chinese transport company had rushed 4,000 tons of machinery, vehicles, and accessories from the United States to Vietnam. This batch of goods had previously been loaded on a Chinese naval auxiliary ship, which had been staying here for several weeks. But just after it was transported, an accident happened. These 4,000 tons of goods are probably still in Haiphong or Hanoi. However, it is reported that their ownership is still in the hands of Americans, who can reclaim them from the French.

### German Foreign Ministry Announces Sixth White Paper: Secret Political Archives of the French General Staff Reveal Plans to Bomb Soviet Oil Fields

Berlin. The German Foreign Ministry, on the evening of the 2nd, released Document No. 9 from the secret files of the French General Staff, proving that the Allied Powers were preparing to launch an air raid on the Soviet Caucasus oil region in late June or early July. This document is a communique from General Weygand, Commander-in-Chief of the French forces in the Eastern Mediterranean, dated April 17th of this year, to the commanders-in-chief of the French Air Force and Army, stating that preparations for the bombing of the oil fields have been completed, and the timing of the operation can also be determined. Regarding this operation, there is no need to reach an agreement with Turkey, as such an agreement will certainly be difficult to achieve. The French ambassador to Turkey has already informed the Turkish government in detail that Turkey cannot currently allow aircraft to cross its airspace, nor can it provide airfields for French use, and no other assistance is expected. Supplies will be transported by rail from Aleppo to Nisibin. Weygand mentioned various necessary preparations, including the construction of airfields, the transportation of railway troops and munitions, the arrival of French bombers, the taking of aerial photographs, and the selection of targets. Weygand concluded that the time to begin the operation would be in late June or early July. The communique further stated that the bombing should be completed within a few days, and Turkey should also prepare for hostile acts resulting from the bombing within the specified period. (Haitong Telegraph on the 4th)

Berlin. The German Foreign Ministry yesterday released the sixth White Paper, the content of which pertains to the secret political archives of the French General Staff that German intelligence teams recovered from a train destroyed by artillery fire in the town of Charité along the Loire River. According to official explanations, these archives can also be regarded as evidence of the British and French plans to force Germany to submit. The content is as follows:

(1) Cutting off the supply of Swedish iron ore, or destroying its iron ore mines.

(2) Destroying the oil wells in Romania and the Soviet Baku region.

(3) Winning over the Scandinavian countries to fight against Germany, so that the Allied Powers can gain more divisions in terms of military strength.

(4) Urging Romania, Turkey, Greece, and Yugoslavia to declare war on Germany. If the four countries agree, they can mobilize approximately one hundred divisions against Germany.

The first secret file is a telegram from General Weygand to General Gamelin on March 7, 1940, revealing the secret that Britain was then preparing to bomb the Soviet Baku oil fields. The telegram stated briefly, "General Gamelin is aware that Air Marshal Mitchell, commander of the British Middle East Air Force, has received instructions from London to prepare to bomb Baku, and requests that he ask General Kucmak to allow him to inspect the airfields in the areas of Deqabechi Elisson and Kasield, and to allow his planes to land at each airfield. As for his base, he intends to establish it in Deizileh. Therefore, Air Marshal Mitchell has also made a request to me to inspect the French airfield in Deizileh. However, in terms of the political situation in Iraq, there may be disputes regarding this, so I am submitting this request as above. Now I have agreed with Air Marshal Mitchell that when British and French officers go to inspect in the near future, they will all change into plain clothes to avoid attracting attention, ostensibly to investigate the oil development projects there. (Signed) Weygand."

The second secret file is a memorandum written by General Gamelin on March 10, 1940, revealing the secret that Britain and France intended to set up new battle lines in Scandinavia and the Balkans. It stated briefly, "Since January 16, 1940, the French military high command has drafted the entire plan for armed intervention in Finland. The Allied detachment agreed to first land at Petsamo. At the same time, Allied forces occupied the seaports and airfields on the west coast of Norway as a precautionary measure. Thereafter, if possible, military action could be extended to Sweden. The iron ore fields of Gällivare, which are extremely important for the supply of iron ore to Germany, should be occupied immediately. At the same time, a new transportation line should be established between Narvik and Luleå. When conducting semi-official discussions with the British high military authorities, the British side also held the same view. Subsequently, at the British-French military talks on January 31st and February 1st, the British side placed the issue of direct assistance to Finland in the second stage, indicating that action should first be taken against the iron ore fields in northern Sweden. The British-French Supreme Military Council also mostly supported this view. Thus, preparations for an expedition to Scandinavia began. The Allied Joint Force Command prepared to depart on March 1st. As for the Balkans, if war can be launched in the Balkans, it can increase economic pressure on Germany. However, from a military point of view, action in the Balkans can benefit France more than in Scandinavia. However, this issue still depends on Italy's attitude. If so, the scope of the war will inevitably tend to expand. Yugoslavia, Romania, Greece, and Turkey can mobilize one hundred divisions, supplementing the strength of the Allied Powers. Conversely, in Scandinavia, Sweden and Norway can only mobilize ten divisions. However, the outbreak of war in Scandinavia is also beneficial to Britain and France. Regarding the plan for Scandinavia, we should make every effort to rescue Finland, and at the very least, we must control Sweden's iron ore fields and Norwegian seaports. But from a strategic point of view, the Balkans and the Caucasus are more important and beneficial, as they can cut off Germany's oil supply. But the key to the Balkans is still in the hands of Italy. (Signed) Gamelin."

The third secret file is a telegram from General Gamelin to General Weygand on March 12, 1940, stating briefly, "I believe that the British army should be responsible for the war in the Middle East, and the Turkish army should be responsible for military affairs in the Caucasus. The commander-in-chief can discuss this issue with General Kiocmak, the Turkish Chief of Staff. As for the strategy for the Caucasus, a summary will be sent by special envoy."

The fourth secret file is a secret telegram sent by the French ambassador to Turkey, Marché-Grillou, on March 14, 1940, stating briefly, "Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu told me that he had received a telegram from the Turkish ambassador to the Soviet Union, mentioning the Soviet's terrifying bombing of Baku. I immediately replied that new-style bombers could fly from Deizileh or northern Iraq to Baku, but they would fly over the airspace of Turkey and Iran. The Turkish Foreign Minister then said, 'Does your country want to lodge a protest with Iran?' However, he did not explicitly state whether it would cause difficulties for Turkey. If I were to ask him this question, it would seem awkward, so I did not continue to discuss this issue. But this is an extremely important matter, so I am telegraphing General Gamelin and relaying this situation to the British ambassador to Turkey. (Signed) Marché-Grillou."

The fifth secret file is General Gamelin's final recommendation to the commander-in-chief, advocating forcing Germany to abandon its "current wait-and-see attitude," imposing a blockade on neutral countries, and using "retaliatory" measures against violators. If Norway and Sweden violate the blockade and provide supplies to Germany, their foreign trade routes will be cut off. At the same time, it further advocated cutting off the supply of Soviet oil to Germany, but this raised the issue of war against the Soviet Union, and the cooperation of Turkey was taken as a countermeasure. If so, bombing the Baku oil fields could completely cut off Germany's fuel supply. At the same time, it was hoped that air bases could be obtained in Turkey. To help realize this plan, the navy should blockade traffic in the Black Sea. At the same time, in order to hinder Germany's inland waterway transport, bombs should be dropped on various rivers by aircraft. Although the Soviet-Finnish armistice was disappointing, the important goal we set for 1940 remains unchanged. We should win over the neutral countries. At this juncture, we should simultaneously devote ourselves to military and diplomatic activities. (Signed) Gamelin." (Haitong Telegraph on the 4th)

### British Parliament Discusses Freedom of Speech: A Member Requests Guarantees, Churchill Indicates Scope

London. A member recently asked the Prime Minister to guarantee the complete freedom that newspapers previously enjoyed, so that they can express their free and unconstrained opinions on all aspects of the war, or comment on any attempt to initiate peace discussions. Party Minister Attlee replied on behalf of the Prime Minister, stating that the government's policy is to not interfere with the freedom of newspapers to express opinions or comment on issues of war and peace as far as possible. However, it must be recognized that if speech that provides intelligence to the enemy or seeks to undermine war efforts is used under the guise of expressing opinions, then the government is not prepared to provide a guarantee of non-interference (cheers from the crowd).

### Details of British Mail Ship Sinking: Over a Thousand Germans and Italians on Board, Majority Rescued After Being Hit by a Torpedo

London. The British mail ship "Arandura Star" (15,501 tons), recently sunk by a German submarine off the west coast of Scotland, carried approximately 2,000 people. Survivors recounted the terrible scenes on board before the ship sank. The ship was hit by a torpedo at around 6 a.m. The enemies detained on the ship, especially the Italians, rushed to clear a path, pushing others aside, to seize lifeboats and escape. After being hit by the torpedo, the ship began to sink very quickly. At that time, everyone on board had life jackets, and lifeboats and rafts were quickly lowered. The victims swam or rested on rafts. Two hours later, they saw an airplane and knew that help would soon arrive. Fortunately, the sea was calm, but debris and corpses were seen floating with the waves all around. (Reuters Telegraph on the 4th)

London. The British mail ship "Arandura Star," carrying 1,500 detained Germans and Italians to Canada, was sunk by a German submarine with a torpedo. Approximately 1,000 survivors were landed yesterday at a port in Scotland by a British ship. The "Arandura Star" had British soldiers escorting the ship. After being hit by the torpedo, they sank along with many Germans and Italians. When the torpedo hit, people were panicked and rushed to clear a path, which greatly hindered the lowering of lifeboats. Two soldiers said, "The ship was hit without warning. Although we hate the German submarines, it is not as much as the Germans and Italians on board, because those people fiercely criticized this kind of warfare, almost like crazy people. At that time, the order was chaotic, so it was quite difficult to jump into the lifeboats." The captain and several senior crew members were standing on the bridge and on the deck. Some of them may have sunk with the ship. Some British soldiers severely criticized the behavior of the German prisoners, saying that they were rude and cruel, trying to push the Italians aside, so the British soldiers had to stop them. Germans and Italians in the mail ship's lifeboats clearly showed hostility, and the British army continued to guard to prevent them from fighting each other. It is not yet possible to estimate the number of casualties, but it seems that most of the Italians who were British merchants suffered the heaviest casualties. There were also casualties among the crew and the British army. When a lifeboat capsized, a German prisoner on the boat immediately asked everyone in the water to help turn the boat upright, and then rescued the people in the water to get on board. According to the shipping company, most of the crew members have been rescued. The total number of deaths has not yet been determined. In addition to those who are already in a port in Scotland, it is hoped that more people have escaped and landed. (Reuters Telegraph on the 4th)

### British African Donations: War Fund

London. The Legislative Council of Sierra Leone in West Upper Guinea, Africa, recently unanimously passed a motion, acknowledging the benefits that Sierra Leone has received under the British flag for 153 years, and approved the allocation of £100,000 in British currency to donate to the Imperial War Fund. Colonial Secretary Lord Lloyd telegraphed the Governor of the Gold Coast, expressing his gratitude for the donation of £100,000 and the undertaking of a £500,000 interest-free loan to fund Spitfires or aircraft.

### High Cost of Living in Hong Kong: Many Overseas Students Return to the Mainland for Education, Semester Exams Completed Within a Week, Several Schools Preparing to Relocate Back to the Mainland

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The summer vacation is approaching, and schools are holding semester exams and preparing to open tutoring classes. Because the cost of living in Hong Kong is rising, making it difficult to maintain, many graduates and students are planning to transfer to schools in the mainland. There are also schools planning to relocate back to the mainland. The details are recorded separately below.

Transfer to the Mainland

The cost of living in Hong Kong is increasing day by day, and school expenses are especially high, making it difficult for middle and lower-class families to sustain. There are many students who have dropped out mid-semester, with each school having several to more than ten students. With the end of the current semester, most of the high school graduates who are able to continue their education are preparing to apply to universities in the mainland. In addition to those preparing to participate in the unified admissions in Hong Kong, the rest are gradually returning to the mainland to apply. According to news from the visa office, more than one hundred students have returned to the country via Vietnam in the past ten days. Many high school students who have not graduated are also planning to transfer to other schools. In the past week, school authorities have received many requests from students for transfer certificates. Most of the schools requested for transfer are provincial and county high schools in southern Guangdong and northern Guangdong. There are also those going to high schools in Guangxi, Yunnan, and other places. According to a student, some commercialized schools are now putting many obstacles in the way of students requesting transfers.

Schools Relocating

In order to develop Guangdong culture, the Guangdong Provincial authorities have ordered all universities to relocate to the province. South China Agricultural College has already relocated. It is recently heard that the Guangdong Provincial authorities have sent another letter to Lingnan, National, and Guangzhou Universities in Hong Kong, considering relocating back to Guangdong to promote Guangdong culture. The relocation expenses will also be borne by the provincial government to some extent. As for the South China University established in Hong Kong, a new main campus has been built at Jiaoxikou in the north of Meixian city. The school environment is quite good. It is expected that many students from the Hong Kong campus of South China will transfer to the main campus. The Provincial Temporary High School, since the fall of Wan Chai, relocated to Tak Ming Secondary School in Hong Kong to teach. It has now been decided to relocate to Enping during the summer vacation. More than two hundred students at the school will also relocate with the school. It is also learned that three schools, formerly a certain high school from Guangzhou that took the Kowloon-Mong Kok route, are currently preparing to relocate back to the mainland due to certain issues.

On the Tianxing side, only Dong Shouchun supported the team, and the situation became increasingly disparate. In the first half, Tianxing only scored seven points with free throws and shots, while Bailemen led with a score of twenty-six to seven.

### Finance: Negative Rumors Fill the Market, Gold Becomes a One-Sided Affair

Yesterday, the spot gold market plummeted by more than 200 yuan, as rumors spread that Hong Kong gold prices had fallen below the 5,000 yuan mark. Furthermore, due to the obstruction of gold transportation in Hong Kong, those who had purchased gold in Shanghai for transport to Hong Kong were forced to sell it. It was also reported that 1,000 taels of gold had arrived in Tianjin and were being sold in the market, increasing the selling pressure in the market. Generally, those holding gold saw the unfavorable situation and decided to sell it off. The opening price was stable at 5,300 yuan, and it even rose by 30 yuan as money changers absorbed some of it. However, this soon led to a large-scale selling spree. Silver firms and gold firms sold off in large quantities, and securities firms and jewelry stores also dumped their holdings. Although some money changers continued to buy, the disparity between buyers and sellers was too great, and the buying became weaker. The price bottomed out at 5,050 yuan, threatening to plunge into the 5,000 yuan mark. Fortunately, the price recovered at the close of the morning session, closing at 5,080 yuan. The market was still weak at the beginning of the afternoon session, opening at 5,095 yuan and soon dropping by more than 10 yuan. However, gold firms and securities firms suddenly showed buying interest and started to buy in, pushing the price up to 5,180 yuan. However, the money changers who had bought in during the day took the opportunity to close out their positions, so the evening session only reached 5,130 yuan, down 215 yuan from the previous day. The total trading volume for the day was about 4,000 taels. Gold jewelry at jewelry stores was discounted by 20 yuan, while customs gold remained unchanged.

Spot Gold Nears the 5,000 Yuan Mark

The price of spot gold opened at 45 yuan lower per bar (10 taels) due to weak market sentiment. Silver firms sold gold to money changers at 5,300 yuan per 10 taels. Later, thanks to the buying by a money changer and a securities firm, the price rose by 30 yuan. Silver firms sold a total of 30 taels of gold to money changers at 5,330 yuan. Then, as foreign exchange rates weakened, securities firms and silver firms competed to dump their holdings, causing the price to fall by 70 yuan. Money changers sold a total of several dozen taels to silver firms at 5,260 yuan. After that, the selling subsided slightly, and money changers bought in slightly, causing the price to rise by 30 yuan again. Gold firms traded 30 taels among themselves at 5,290 yuan. Considering the increasingly weak foreign exchange rates and various negative news spreading in the market, another wave of selling was triggered. Securities firms and silver firms rushed to dump their holdings, and gold firms followed suit. Although some buyers saw the low prices and continued to buy in, the short positions were extremely large, and the price soon plummeted by 240 yuan. Gold firms sold 10 taels to silver firms at 5,050 yuan. At noon, silver firms and money changers' appetite for buying improved, and the price rose. Securities firms sold 20 taels to gold firms at 5,080 yuan at the midday close. In the afternoon, market conditions remained poor. Silver firms sold 10 taels to money changers at 5,095 yuan. Later, due to retail sales, the price fell by another 15 yuan. Silver firms traded 10 taels among themselves at 5,080 yuan. Then, a gold firm suddenly started to buy in, and the exchange rate also weakened sharply. Securities firms followed suit, pushing the price up by 100 yuan. Gold firms sold several dozen taels to their counterparts at 5,180 yuan. Before the evening close, the price retreated to 5,130 yuan as foreign exchange rates remained weak and high prices were difficult to sustain. Silver firms sold 20 taels to gold firms, closing at 5,130 yuan for the evening. As a result, the price fell by 215 yuan compared to the previous day. The market was even weaker after the close, with sellers willing to sell at 5,115 yuan, but no transactions were made. The price fluctuated by 280 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold at gold firms was also several dozen yuan higher than spot gold, while the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The margin gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Drops Three Times in a Row

The selling price of jewelry gold at jewelry stores was initially 550 yuan per tael at Datong Bank. At 10:00 AM, it was discounted by 10 yuan. At 11:00 AM, it was discounted by another 10 yuan. At noon, it was discounted by another 10 yuan. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, it rose by 10 yuan. As a result, the price was 20 yuan lower than the previous day. Datong Bank lowered the price to 530 yuan, while Xin Datong Bank had the same price. The buying price was about 30 yuan lower.

Discount Rate at 45 Yuan, Interest Rates Also Lower

Yesterday, the discount rate for foreign exchange bills fell sharply. The discount rate was as low as 45 yuan per thousand yuan, and the selling rate was only 50 yuan. There were no changes in the afternoon. The price fell by another 10 yuan compared to the previous day. The interest rate set by the Money Dealers Association fell by another 0.1 fen, totaling 0.21 fen. It is rumored that it may fall below 0.2 fen.

### Foreign Exchange: Selling Becomes More Eager

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The dark market for British and American currency was still selling more than buying, and the trend was weakening. The rumor that the new Sino-American loan negotiation had been established was becoming more prevalent, and the atmosphere of peace in Europe was becoming stronger. It was also rumored that Hong Kong gold prices had fallen below the 5,000 yuan mark, and that the import of gold into Hong Kong was obstructed. Spot gold also fell sharply, affecting the foreign exchange market. The opening price for US dollars reached 6.28125 yuan. In the afternoon, Chinese merchants bought in to profit, and the price recovered slightly. However, the selling trend re-emerged, so the closing price was at the weakest level. The closing price for first pound sterling was 3.9375 yuan, US dollar was 6.28125 yuan, long British pound was 0.0625 yuan, and long American pound was 1.5625 yuan. The trading volume was extremely high throughout the day. Yesterday was the US Independence Day, and there were no telegrams for US exchange rates today.

Hong Kong Initially Absorbs US Dollars

The London telegraph initially showed a near fall of 0.0625 for long British pounds and a flat price for forward contracts. The price for US silver was unchanged, and the prices for London raw gold, exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars and Shanghai currency, etc., were also flat. There was no telegram for the exchange rate against French francs. The exchange rate for US dollars against British pounds was up 0.02, and the exchange rate against Shanghai currency was up 0.1 yuan. There was no market for French francs. The central bank's listed prices remained the same. The bank's opening selling price for spot was 3.875 pounds sterling and 6.125 yuan US dollars, which were both flat compared to the previous close. The opening prices for futures were also unchanged. After the opening, British banks were all intending to sell. Although the Hong Kong telegram and a certain client absorbed about 100,000 US dollars, short positions were quite plentiful, and the market was firm. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax was reduced by 0.25%. At that time, the Hong Kong telegram entered British banks, favoring Macalister and American banks' July US dollar exchange rate of 6.15625 and 125. Subsequently, a speculator came to buy in spot US dollars, priced at 6.1875 yuan at American banks. However, Chinese banks dumped their holdings, and the potential trend gradually weakened. Chinese banks sold July US dollars to foreign banks such as HSBC and Macalister from 6.1875 to 25. By the close, the price became longer, the first pound sterling was 3.9375 yuan, and the US dollar was 6.28125 yuan. The July British gold was 3.90625 pounds sterling, and the US dollar was 6.25 yuan. Compared with the morning opening, the spot British pound was up 0.0625, the US dollar was down 1.5625, and the futures were also longer.

Chinese Merchants Buy In to Profit

At the beginning of the afternoon, Chinese merchant speculators bought in to profit, once buying July US dollars at 6.25 to 21875. The market showed a slight softening. Later, they returned the profits to foreign banks, favoring the same month US dollar at 6.25 and 6.28125 at British banks and Zhejiang banks. Therefore, the evening closing price was exactly the same as the midday closing price. The British gold was 3.9375 pounds sterling, the US dollar was 6.28125 yuan, the July British gold was 3.90625 pounds sterling, and the US dollar was 6.25 yuan. Compared with the previous day's close, the spot British pound was up 0.0625, the US dollar was down 1.5625, the July British pound was down 0.0625, and the US dollar was down 1.875.

Tianjin: British Gold Strengthens

The spot US exchange rate remained unchanged at 5.625 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 1 yuan to 110 yuan. The black market for "Joint Notes" increased by 1.4 yuan to 96 yuan.

### US Dollar Notes: Drop Below the 16 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds plummet in line with spot gold by 5 yuan. The British and American gold notes frequently loosened in the black market foreign exchange. Supplies from all parties were quite smooth. The former fell by 0.5 yuan, and the latter even fell below the 16 yuan mark. Hong Kong notes fell by 0.05 yuan following the drop in Hong Kong and Shanghai exchange rates. Canadian notes and Philippine notes were not lacking in supply, and the market prices were consistently weak. The supply of Japanese gold notes was drastically reduced, and the market price gradually stabilized, reaching 1.135 yuan in the evening session. The supply and demand of Korean notes were balanced, and the price remained at 0.97 yuan in the evening session.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Japanese Merchants Buy Broad Beans

Recently, the broad bean market has been affected by two factors: first, with the price of rice being expensive, people in the countryside intend to store broad beans as a staple food, resulting in a lack of supply; and second, although traders lack ship space for transportation, Japanese merchants still come to the market to purchase and ship broad beans to South China and North China. Therefore, with the limited supply and high demand, the price has been gradually rising. Yesterday, merchants from the main street and Xinghua purchased more than 600 bags of Jiading white broad beans at a price of 22.5 yuan, 200 bags of Wuhu small white broad beans at a price of 20 yuan, and more than 250 bags of Beigang green broad beans at a price of 23 yuan to 21.5 yuan.

In addition, 385 bags of beans were shipped to Hong Kong today.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Continues to Weaken

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to weaken. The association's clearing price for spot No. 24 coarse white sugar was 69 yuan for the bonded warehouse and 68 yuan for the non-bonded warehouse. The price in the afternoon was 68.3 yuan to 68.1 yuan, down 0.7 yuan to 0.9 yuan. The re-export price was 54 yuan and 0.5 yuan, and the delivery price on July 10 was 54.7 yuan to 54.5 yuan, down 0.7 yuan. The price for Taiyuan car white B-mark sugar was 79 yuan for the Western warehouse and 78.5 yuan for the Eastern warehouse. Dutch red sugar was 57.5 yuan to 57.3 yuan, native snow white sugar was 69 yuan, No. 1 rock sugar was 91 yuan, and Jingming rock sugar was 92.5 yuan, all down 0.5 yuan. The national sugar opened at 51 yuan for more than 160 bags of Hainan red sugar.

### Securities: Domestic Sentiment Suddenly Excited

The securities dark market suddenly changed yesterday, with prices rising across the board. Class A stocks approached 62 yuan, Class B stocks exceeded 2 yuan to 2.5 yuan again, and even Class D stocks, which had been sluggish, exceeded 9 yuan. The market situation can be considered good. Initially, there were rumors of peace between Germany and Britain, which may lead to a resolution of the Sino-Japanese conflict. In the afternoon, there were rumors that the loan application to the United States had a hope of success, and market sentiment became firmer. Furthermore, the sharp decline in gold prices had a very good impact. Short sellers rushed to cover their positions, and the market situation rose gradually from beginning to end. However, large investors among buyers and sellers were still not enthusiastic. There were not many transactions in the morning. Lianhe bought in slightly, and Shuntai sold out. Demand suddenly increased in the afternoon. Lianhe continued to buy in, and Shunheng, Gongmao, Dafeng, Hu Heji, and sporadic retail investors covered their positions or went long. Jiufeng turned to selling, and Jiukang sold out more. Lianyi, Xieda, and Yichang all sold out, but the prices still rose steadily. However, it is hoped that the news can be confirmed, otherwise it will still be difficult to stabilize. The result of the price increases was a uniform increase of 0.4 yuan to 0.6 yuan. The total turnover was approximately 900,000 yuan. A brief summary table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 61.80 61.40 61.70 Up 0.45

Unified B 52.55 52.05 12.50 Up 0.60

Unified C 50.75 50.30 50.75 Up 0.40

Unified D 49.20 49.00 49.20 Up 0.40

Unified E 50.40 50.05 50.40 Up 0.40

In stock trading, 100 shares of Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 21.5 yuan.

The stock market at the Public Concourse yesterday opened quietly and gradually trended upward. The turnover was acceptable. Jardine Matheson shares once reached 31 yuan, and British-American Tobacco shares also reached 24.5 yuan. The high prices attracted a lot of profit-taking, but the market's absorption capacity was also not weak. The rubber shares also attracted more attention.

London, 3rd (Wednesday) - The listed prices of stocks of various British companies in the London Far East market showed a uniform recovery in bank stocks. Macalister Bank rose by 7 shillings and 6 pence to 5 pounds, 17 shillings and 6 pence. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's UK registered shares rose by 4 pounds to 63 pounds. However, Gongping Coal Mine unregistered shares continued to fall by 6 pence to 15 shillings and 6 pence. The rest remained unchanged.

### Beifa Distributes Final Dividend

Beifa Co., Ltd. in this city will hold its 55th annual shareholders' meeting on July 10 and will distribute the final dividend for the year ending February 1940, at 1 yuan per share, together with the interim dividend of 0.5 yuan per share, for a total of 1.5 yuan per share for the year. The company's profits for this year reached 450,000 yuan.

### Food: Rice Prices Rise Immediately After Falling

The rice market yesterday morning saw both buyers and sellers decline following the trend of the previous day. The sellers were afraid of another direct plunge, due to the arrival of 60,000 to 70,000 bags of foreign rice and the expected arrival of 200,000 to 300,000 bags of Siamese rice within ten days. Market sentiment softened, and the selling pressure suddenly increased, causing prices to plunge by 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan, and nearly 2 yuan in some cases. Small-grain rice was sold at only 61 yuan, and second-grade Tokyo pointed rice had retreated below the 60 yuan mark, ranging from 59.5 yuan to 59 yuan. However, small-grain merchants no longer sold, and the floating supply dried up. Inland merchants and rural households took advantage of the low prices to purchase lower-grade goods, and the market became active. Low-priced goods were the first to rebound, exceeding the 60 yuan mark again. Subsequently, local stores also joined the buying spree, and the market recovered to its original level by closing, similar to the previous market. No. 1 old Saigon rice remained at 65.5 yuan, No. 2 at 63.5 yuan, No. 1 Siamese rice at 65 yuan, and new Annam short-grain rice at 65.2 yuan. Small-grain rice was 62.7 yuan to 62.5 yuan. However, the market fluctuated by as much as 2 yuan. The total spot trading volume was more than 6,000 bags, and the futures trading volume was 200 tons.

The glutinous rice market continued to be firm. According to industry insiders, the reason is that inland stocks are depleted, the supply is not continuous, and the Shanghai warehouses have thin inventories. At the same time, the price of glutinous rice is relatively low compared to other goods, making it popular among the general public. The storefront sales are booming, and the demand from food vendors is particularly strong. Scarcity makes the product valuable, and the selling price continues to rise by about 1.5 yuan. Jinyang white glutinous rice is 65 yuan, Changdan white glutinous rice is 63-64 yuan, and Jiangbei glutinous rice is out of stock and there is no market.

More than 1,000 bags of thick and thin short-grain domestic rice continued to arrive. It is rumored that the off-market trading was scarce for two reasons: first, the sharp decline in foreign rice prices in the early market made market sentiment nervous, and sellers sought to unload; and second, the high selling prices made it difficult to sell to customers. The asking prices continued to depreciate by 1 yuan. Changbang special clear short-grain rice was 73.5 yuan to 73 yuan, Su Kun Changzhou short-grain rice was 71-72 yuan, old rice was 69 yuan, Qingsi special thin rice was 73 yuan, and general rice was 72 yuan to 70 yuan. Nangang early rice was 69 yuan.

### Inland Flour Floods the Market, Wheat Supply to Be Opened

Wheat Flour: Yesterday, the market continued to stand firm. The No. 2 flour mill's asking price was still 15.2 yuan, limited only to supply for actual sales on the main street. Guest merchants and hoarders were all restricted, creating the sale of inland miscellaneous brands such as Double Lion, Jinshan, Johnson, and Phoenix brands flooding the market. Yesterday, spot Green Phoenix and Double Lion brands were all sold for 16 yuan. It is rumored that there were also futures sales, with July and August Phoenix flour at 16.4 yuan, and Jinshan and Johnson flour at 16.1 yuan, which is 2-3 yuan lower than the peak price. Only about 10,000 bags were approved for sale by Chinese factories.

Wheat: Yesterday, the new wheat supply gradually arrived in small quantities, but the formal market has not yet opened. Most of the wheat was for delivery of previously sold goods. It is rumored that Japanese factories bought nearly 10,000 bags at a price of 25 yuan to 24.5-6 yuan. Chinese factories had only a small amount to buy. It is rumored that the handling of transportation permits has made considerable progress, and it is feared that the wheat market will soon surge.

### Yarn: July Futures Yarn Rumored to Have Been Traded, Cancellation of Margin and Change to Difference Payment

The yarn market is calm, and the overall situation is in a state of fluctuation. At the same time, in actual transactions, the Hong Kong and Yunnan gangs have been actively purchasing coarse yarn, so market sentiment is relatively stable. According to the market, July futures yarn has been traded slightly at a price of 910 yuan to 895 yuan. Neither side collects margin. When the market price changes by 100 yuan, the difference of 100 yuan is paid. This approach is equivalent to a disguised exchange. In this regard, the market will not have major ups and downs, of course, there will be no problems. If the amount of chips increases, the fluctuations will be great, and future disputes will be even more difficult to resolve.

The opening price for spot yarn in the morning was 890 yuan for 20-count Double Horse yarn due to various unfavorable factors and conditions for the bulls, falling to 880 yuan. Later, it was heard that the Guangdong gang still had demand, and market sentiment was revitalized, rising again to 897 yuan. Unexpectedly, the weakening of foreign exchange and the decline in gold prices caused the market to soften again, falling back again. The closing price was 887 yuan. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 1,899 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was not much different from the previous day. Today, 35 pieces of yarn were shipped to Xiamen, 30 pieces to Hong Kong, and 95 pieces to Yantai. The amount purchased by each gang is listed below:

Same Industry 1,200 Hong Kong 325

Inland 4 Ningbo 200

Yunnan 170 Total 1,899

### Cotton Market Stagnation Amidst Hesitant Industry Observers

Spot cotton trading remains as dull as ever, with few buyers from factories. Industry peers are also hesitant to move forward, with only Japanese factories making some purchases. However, payment for these purchases is delayed by one to two months. American upland cotton (彭家浦) is priced at $202. Japanese factories purchased 200 bales with payment due in two months.

Regarding overseas cotton market prices, the New York cotton market initially showed firmness due to reports of unfavorable weather in cotton-growing regions. Later, purchases from New Orleans and Liverpool pushed closing prices higher, up 7 to 16 points compared to the previous day. There was no trading in the Indian market yesterday, but a rise of one and a half rupees is predicted.

Transactions in Shanghai's foreign cotton market are extremely quiet. All parties are adopting a wait-and-see attitude due to the complex situation. Fellow traders are holding firm to their positions, citing difficulties in transporting Indian cotton.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth's Decline Proves Difficult to Reverse

Domestic Cloth: Yesterday, Zhejiang merchants suddenly became active, with a slight increase in demand for dyed grey cloth. However, due to the abundant inventory in the market, it's difficult to reverse the downward trend. White goods like fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth continue to fall by about 2.5 dimes per piece. Bleached and dyed cloth fell by about 5 dimes. Merchants from the Zhejiang route, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Taizhou, sold over 500 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, twill, colored cloth, and printed cloth, reportedly due to the fact that most goods originally imported from Guangdong and Yunnan are now entering through Zhejiang ports. Dyers on this street sold over 100 pieces of lower-grade twill. Wholesale dealers sold one hundred and several dozen pieces of coarse cloth and bleached and dyed cloth. Fujian merchants sold corduroy (線叫嗶嘰) at 82.5 cents, but sales remain slow. However, trading on this street is slightly more active, and sellers are becoming scarce. By the afternoon closing, there was a slight upward trend. Dragon Head brand sold at $28.40, and corduroy at 83.5 cents.

### Dried Fruits and Nuts: Candied Tangerines Rise by Three Dollars

Twenty cases of newly arrived Xiamen candied tangerines were released yesterday. The price is up by three dollars compared to previous trading. Market prices are also being quoted higher, and further tightening of supply is anticipated.

### Silk and Tea: Export of Chinese Tea Restricted Due to Production Limits

Since the outbreak of the European war, the foreign trade of Chinese tea has suffered a significant blow. More recently, Italy's entry into the war has disrupted Mediterranean shipping, causing trade routes to stagnate. To adapt to the environment and adjust supply and demand, the Chinese authorities, through the Trade Commission, convened a meeting in Chongqing to implement production limits on exported black and green tea. Production will be reduced by 20% compared to the previous year, based on the traditional tea production proportions of each province. According to general estimates, the quota for Anhui and Jiangxi regions this year is 340,000 boxes, Zhejiang and Fujian 280,000 boxes, and Hunan and Hubei 180,000 boxes. It is expected that the total export volume of Chinese tea this year, under the central control, will still reach 800,000 boxes. Today, 205 pieces of tea were shipped to Xiamen.

### Medicinal Materials: Honeysuckle Trading Scarce, Low as $175

Since the start of summer, new honeysuckle has been abundantly available and sold in a timely manner, making the market quite active. Previously, the market price reached a high of $220, then fell to $200. Currently, various merchant groups have gradually stocked up sufficiently, leading to sluggish sales. Inventory is also ample, and transactions are only sporadic. For example, new goods from Shangzhuang are selling for $180 to $175, while existing inventory attracts little interest.

### Oil Market: Crude Oil Sees Some Back and Forth

Yesterday, 3,500 cans and another 100 pieces of crude oil were transported from Tianjin. Today, there was an export of 994 cans of crude oil to Hong Kong, and another 145 cans to Xiamen.

### Metals: Huisheng Iron Remains Steady

Due to the obstruction of sales channels for Huisheng Iron by merchants from Southeast Asia (Nanyang幫), coupled with the sluggish purchases of merchants from Northern China, such as those from Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao, the market is quite bleak and sentiment is very depressed. Although factories in this area producing toys, printed iron, cans, cigarettes, and biscuits occasionally search for supplies, actual transactions are limited. Due to high costs and scarce arrivals, prices remain firm. Old steel is around $200, and new steel around $180.

### Couple Knowledge: Hygiene Tips for Loving Couples

— Co-authored by Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor, and Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Sichuan Road Intersection, Beijing

(Hours) 10 AM to 6 PM, Closed Sundays

Couples should indeed be loving, but in their love, they often neglect hygiene.

If sexual weakness is discovered to hinder love, seek effective treatment promptly.

In the arena of courtship, a man pursues a young woman, painstakingly employing all means to progress from unfamiliarity to acquaintance, from acquaintance to friendship, and then further to love. He may become so infatuated that he neglects eating and sleeping. Once mutual understanding leads to marriage, both parties harbor burning desires in their hearts. Therefore, after the wedding ceremony, once the guests have departed, they are sure to complete the scene of "brocade curtains stir without wind, silver hooks move, delicate moans fill the air, and dreams are fragrant." This scene marks the beginning of their shared new world. Many men, after a blissful marriage, enjoy smooth sailing, with decades passing like a single day. When their children grow up, all are intelligent and capable, and their careers are successful, with everything going as desired, their relatives and friends wish them prosperity, longevity, and many sons. At this point, they suddenly realize the effectiveness of marital love and mutual support, and they smile broadly, feeling indescribable joy in their hearts! The birthday celebrations of Guo Ziyi in history and the centennial celebration of Mr. Ma Xiangbo in the past are both well-known.

However, the affairs of the world are often full of contradictions. Loving couples often neglect the essential principles of hygiene, leading to widespread debauchery. Furthermore, some men, due to youthful self-pollution, excessive indulgence, or infection, suffer weakened innate functions. Once married, they often experience nocturnal emissions (遺精), spermatorrhea (滑精), and dissipated energy, leading to infertility and neurasthenia. Although the desire is there, the strength is lacking, and the couple's sexual life cannot be fulfilled. In such cases, a young wife, forced to watch her youth pass by idly, cannot help but feel resentment. As a result, the couple may become estranged, constantly quarrel, and even engage in adultery or elopement, leading to divorce proceedings, which are not uncommon! As for the men themselves, they often suffer from extreme nervous weakness, resulting in headaches, brain pain, forgetfulness, insomnia, mental confusion, inability to think, and a ringing sound in their ears with the slightest movement, even leading to fainting and unconsciousness. How many such men can avoid premature aging or early death? The crisis is indeed severe!

Today, with the advancement of medical science, effective treatments are available for the aforementioned conditions. Taking gonadal hormone preparations like "Sheng Zhi Su (生殖素)," can replenish sperm, strengthen the kidneys, invigorate the brain, activate the blood, and nourish the nerves overnight, alleviating the condition. Continued use will completely cure the aforementioned conditions in a short period of time, and can also improve overall health, achieving the effect of rejuvenation. However, those with nocturnal emissions must also take "Ximituo Shi (希米脫氏) Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and prevent leakage, resulting in even faster results. However, patients who can personally come to our clinic in Shanghai for electrotherapy, injections, surgery, and other targeted treatments are guaranteed a cure.

### Beauty: Breasts are the Source of Happiness for Women

— Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Regardless of the occasion, beautiful and healthy women always have an advantage. Men are always attracted to them, and society respects them. So, how can women enhance their beauty and health? Medically speaking, the key is to maintain healthy ovarian function. When a woman's ovaries are healthy, the characteristic features of her body develop well. The most obvious is the firm, elastic peak of the breasts. Even when wearing clothes, the shape can be seen, with two peaks standing side by side, creating a deep valley in between. How intoxicating is that! At the same time, the buttocks must also be relatively developed, adding to the supple waist to form the woman's most mysterious and complete curves. Women with such well-developed bodies also have a strong metabolism, producing a large number of new cells in the skin, muscles, blood, and endocrine system. As a result, the skin naturally becomes white, tender, and moist, the muscles become plump and full, and the blood is rich and red. The rosy complexion shines through the moist skin, creating an apple-like beauty. Therefore, such women possess completely natural beauty and health, unattainable by others through cosmetics alone. Not only are they incomparably happy and beautiful during their virginity, like peach blossoms smiling in the spring breeze, but if they are chosen by a lover and married, the love between the couple will deepen, and they will have children early, forming a sweet family. At this time, they are not only a glorious housewife but also a happy mother. However, there are few such women in the world, because most women suffer from irregular menstruation, leukorrhea, lack of sensation, and other ailments, which damage ovarian function, causing it to weaken. Metabolism is also reduced, resulting in flat breasts, a haggard complexion, and an unattractive appearance. They are unable to bear children and lack the qualifications to be mothers. The tragedy of their fate is imaginable. The only remedy is to take the ovarian preparation "Sheng Zhi Su (生殖素)" to nourish the ovaries and nerves. Continued use will completely cure the aforementioned diseases in a short period of time and can also make the breasts stand up, enhancing beauty and health.

### What Bad Consequences Can Nocturnal Emission Lead To?

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

Everyone knows that nocturnal emission in young people is very harmful to the body. But what diseases does it actually lead to! Perhaps even doctors find it difficult to know the details, because the human body is an organic entity, and the myriad changes in disease are difficult to predict. For example, nocturnal emission is generally considered a disease, but the disease itself is not nocturnal emission. Nocturnal emission is a symptom. We study why nocturnal emission occurs, mostly because self-pollution, debauchery, overwork, etc., weaken the nerves. A part of the sexual organs loses its function or becomes oversensitive, so it cannot properly control the function of the sperm gate, resulting in nocturnal emission. If nocturnal emission occurs too frequently, the nerves will become even weaker, and the metabolism will also decline. Too many old cells die, and not enough new cells are produced, resulting in a pale and thin complexion, weakened brainpower, insomnia, forgetfulness, tinnitus, blurred vision, headaches, and other conditions. These are symptoms of extreme weakness of the brain nerves. Lower back pain, soreness in the muscles and bones, fatigue in the limbs, and other conditions are symptoms of extreme weakness of the spinal cord nerves. As for spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, and dissipated energy, these are symptoms of extreme weakness of the sexual nerves. In addition, due to the obstruction of developmental function, it often leads to short stature, small local areas such as fingers, and sparse or even absent sperm production, leading to infertility. These are the inevitable diseases of young people whose nocturnal emissions are not treated. As for anemia, tuberculosis, premature aging, and shortened lifespan, although they are closely related to nocturnal emission, they are also concomitant diseases and vary from person to person. For the effective treatment of nocturnal emission, the best option at this time is to take "Ximituo Shi (希米脫氏) Sperm-Consolidating Tablets." This medicine can strengthen the sperm gate, calm the nerves, promote restful sleep, reduce dreams, and eradicate nocturnal emission. If nocturnal emission has already caused the aforementioned symptoms, you must also take the gonadal preparation "Sheng Zhi Su (生殖素)" to nourish the sperm, blood, brain, kidneys, and nerves. Continued use will completely cure the aforementioned conditions in a short period of time, and can also promote developmental function, boost metabolism, and achieve the effect of prolonging life and rejuvenating.

### Ironclad Facts

— Recorded by Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

(1) Nocturnal Emission and Spermatorrhea Can Lead to Premature Death in Young Men

Mr. Qin Zhilian, twenty years old, from Hangzhou, his father a real estate businessman, quite wealthy. Currently a third-year student at a high school in this city. Due to his intelligence and excellent character, but as the saying goes, cleverness can be a curse. Mr. Qin's romantic feelings blossomed early, leading to conversations and exchanges of love letters with female classmates, which became a habit. Driven by an intense longing, he couldn't help but indulge in the bad habit of self-pollution. Despite repeated attempts to quit, he failed to break free, resulting in weakened seminal control and subsequent nocturnal emission. Initially, it occurred two or three times a month, gradually increasing to five or six times. At first, it was triggered by dreams, but later it occurred even without dreams. This led to feelings of mental fatigue, memory loss, insomnia, and palpitations. With the slightest exertion, he experienced lower back pain and physical exhaustion. His grades, once consistently excellent, now often failed, putting him at risk of being held back. During spring break, he caught a cold and was bedridden for days, worrying that he would die young! Therefore, he specifically requested treatment (as stated by the patient). Mr. Qin came to this clinic for treatment at the beginning of last month. After diagnosis, it was determined that his condition was indeed due to untreated nocturnal emission. He was immediately instructed to purchase two boxes of the highly effective "Hemet's Spermatogenesis Pills" and two dozen vials of the reproductive gland extract "Reproductin," to be taken together. After the nocturnal emission stopped, he continued taking "Reproductin" while receiving Diemen's electrotherapy. After a month, he felt clear-headed, energetic, and the previously mentioned symptoms had completely disappeared.

(2) A Husband's Neurasthenia After Marriage Torments His Wife

Mr. Shen Kexian, thirty years old, works in the banking industry. After marriage, he experienced symptoms of impotency and occasional nocturnal emission, resulting in unsatisfactory or even non-existent marital relations. This was not only frustrating for him but also caused great suffering to his wife. He tried various tonics and supplements on the market, but they had little effect. Recently, he felt increasingly weak and sought treatment (as stated by the patient). After a detailed examination of his condition, he was instructed to purchase three dozen vials of "Reproductin," one box of "Hemet's Spermatogenesis Pills," and receive daily electrotherapy injections. After two months, Mr. Shen felt his strength and vitality restored, and all symptoms disappeared. The love between husband and wife deepened.

### ### General Hird Meets British Ambassador to Discuss Countermeasures to the Far East Situation, Close Cooperation between Britain and the United States to Prevent Aggression, American Public Opinion Unanimously Concerned About China, Relationship between the Next US Presidential Election and the Far East

The Far East situation has recently become tense due to the aggressive intentions of an Eastern nation to seize ports, Vietnam, and the Dutch East Indies. According to a reliable source in diplomatic circles of a certain democratic country, the British and American authorities have repeatedly consulted on their Far East policy and reached a consensus. Admiral Hird, commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao aboard the USS Isabel the day before yesterday (the 4th) to attend yesterday morning's US Independence Day celebration. He then met with British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr at the British Embassy residence around 10 am yesterday to discuss the situation. The content of the discussion is unknown, but it is widely believed that the British Ambassador and Admiral Hird discussed the current situation in the Far East.

Cooperation between Britain and the United States Pleases All Nations

According to a foreign observer, yesterday morning's meeting between Admiral Hird and the British Ambassador is strong evidence of the recent reports of close cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East, which is gratifying to China and other countries. The aggressors in the Far East are about to take action, ostensibly to support Germany and Italy, but in reality, they are purely self-serving, directly seizing the rights and interests of Britain, France, and the Netherlands, and indirectly threatening the United States. The reason for their delay is simply to wait for an opportunity. The main force of their military power is currently tied down by the Chinese resistance. If Britain and the United States strengthen their Far East policy and cooperate, it will surely give them pause.

Policy of the Next US President

The Millard's Review's editorial, titled "The Relationship between the Future US Presidential Election and the Far East," stated that it is impossible to predict whether the next US President will be Roosevelt, who has been elected for an unprecedented third term, or the Republican candidate Wilkie until the national election in November. If the American people want the Democratic Party to take a temporary rest and the Republican Party to take power, the Republican leader, in view of the seriousness of the current European war, may abandon his previous isolationist policy and have to

Assist democratic countries, as the Democratic Party has done. Wilkie's foreign policy, based on his past statements, can be summarized as follows: (1) Advocate for aid to the Allied countries in Europe, but not participate in the war; (2) Adopt a tough policy towards the Far East, but not oppose reaching an understanding with Japan; (3) Implement multilateralism; (4) Most importantly, expand trade and support the Western Hemisphere's

Economic power.

American investment in Japanese power companies amounts to more than US$350 million, but these enterprises have been arbitrarily taken over by the Japanese government and incorporated into political organizations controlled by the military. At the same time, the United States has a significant amount of investment and interests in China, especially the Shanghai Electric Tramways. Wilkie has always been known for paying attention to American investment and interests at home. Therefore, he will undoubtedly give careful consideration to the above matters in the future.

American Public Opinion Extremely Agitated

According to the North-China Daily News, an American who recently returned to Shanghai after traveling through the southern states of the United States said that American public opinion is quite shocked by the actions of the aggressors rampant in the world. Residents of a small town in the southern United States, after receiving news of the German invasion of the Netherlands, turned to support the Allied countries overnight. Even those who previously did not care much about the Allied countries immediately supported the United States giving all kinds of active assistance in order to achieve a quick victory. American

Anti-Japanese sentiment is also very agitated and deeply concerned about all news coming from China. Recently, newspapers have given priority to European news and moved Chinese news to the back, but The New York Times and the Chicago Daily News still publish Chinese news in a special position. Colonel Stimson, the new Secretary of War, has always been in favor of

Embargo on Japan

American people and parties at all levels are greatly influenced by this. The American continued, "While traveling in the United States, I discovered that the American people are very concerned about the current situation of the Chinese people, and many asked questions about it. The relocation of the Chinese people to the west has greatly moved the American people, and the relief efforts in the United States have been widely noticed. Generous assistance has been given from all sides."

### Xujiahui Observatory Continues to Work, Instruments Extremely Complex, Relocation Difficult

After the retreat of the French Concession Police and the French Defense Forces in the Xujiahui area, the Xujiahui Observatory in the area continues to operate as usual because all meteorological, time, and earthquake observation instruments are extremely complex and difficult to move. It continues to make meteorological and time reports on time. The rumor that a small team of French soldiers remains stationed near the observatory for defense is not true. However, the observatory's work is all done internally, and all employees live and work in seclusion. Everything remains normal.

### Yesterday Celebrated US Independence Day, All Sectors Very Excited, Grand Ceremony Held at a Time of Serious Situation, Significant Meaning, Celebration Situation Enthusiastic

Yesterday was American Independence Day. The weather was clear and sunny, and all the celebrations planned by the Americans in Shanghai were able to proceed as scheduled. The enthusiastic atmosphere cannot be described in words. American institutions in this city were closed as usual, but some shops were still open in the morning and closed in the afternoon. The American warships anchored in Shanghai, the Luzon and Admiral Hird's private yacht Isabel, were fully decorated with flags, fluttering in the wind, which was very beautiful. At 8:30 a.m., a flag-raising ceremony was held at the Columbia Country Club, with the US Navy Marine Band playing the American national anthem. In addition to the Marine Band, about 2,000 people attended. American officials in the city, such as Admiral Hird, Acting Consul General Putnam, Inspector General Hillmeck, American Association Chairman Macmillan, Columbia Country Club Chairman Morris, and American Chamber of Commerce Chairman Anderson, all attended the grand ceremony, which was quite solemn. From 12:30 p.m. to 2:00 p.m., the American Chamber of Commerce held a banquet, where guests raised their glasses to bless US President Roosevelt. Other ball games, picnics, and evening dances were also very enthusiastic.

Democratic Front

American Independence was declared in 1776, and the Declaration of Independence was formally issued on July 4 of the same year. At a time when the world situation is becoming increasingly serious, people from all walks of life are very inspired by it, because its meaning is especially important today. In addition to unanimously publishing reports on the celebration of Independence Day by Americans in this city, Western newspapers in this city also wrote commentaries. The British semi-official newspaper North-China Daily News devoted a special section to the text of the Declaration of Independence in a very important position. The article first reprinted a passage from the Declaration of Independence: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness." The article added that at this critical moment, all democratic countries should stand on the same front to resist the same enemy. Britain and the United States are very similar in blood, political and ideological thinking, so American sympathy and assistance to the British will increase. The British side also hopes that this American Independence Day will give people great encouragement. The newspaper's editorial also praised the spirit of Americans in fighting for independence and freedom under the title of "American Independence Day" and believed that it should be emulated.

Fight for Freedom

The Continental Times' editorial, titled "The Zero Point of Democracy," stated: "Today, the United States celebrates its 166th anniversary of independence. At a time when democracy is on the verge of decline, the celebration of independence by the United States has a nature that should be valued by the whole world. The light of free people, that is, the pursuit of freedom, equality and happiness, has once again been challenged by tyrants who want to enslave it. Today, it can be called the zero point of democracy. But strong democracy has gained its greater power in the disappointing period of 1940. In any case, the freedom of individuals and nations can only be saved by resisting foreign aggression. Therefore, fighting for freedom is not a new discovery in human history. Democracy itself is a philosophy of war. American Independence Day is a symbol of the ultimate victory of mankind in fighting for freedom, and today millions of people are fighting for true freedom and light." The Times also wrote a commentary, and finally concluded its article by saying, "We should maintain this glorious day." In addition, various Western newspapers also issued special issues on this day.

### British Official Statement to be Released This Week, For the Service of Overseas Chinese

Yesterday, a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency learned from British officials in this city that a formal statement regarding the plan mentioned by the British Ambassador in his radio broadcast last week, in which British overseas Chinese in this city are engaged in active service, will be released this week. The British Overseas Chinese Association in China recently discussed the issue of enlistment in this city and issued a notice to its members, stating the best way to support the British wartime fund.

### Obstacles in Front of the Post Office Building Have Been Removed

After Mr. Chaplim, Director of the Postal Administration, went to Chongqing on official business in the middle of last month, Mr. Chaplim is expected to stay in Chongqing for up to one month, so he will probably return to his residence in about two weeks. The building of the Bureau on the Bund of Sichuan Road was suddenly cut off by the Japanese with barbed wire on North Suzhou Road, and it was extremely inconvenient for those entering and leaving the post office, who had to go through the Sichuan Road Bridge. However, since the second day, the Japanese removed the barbed wire fence they had set up, so the public can now enter and exit through the Henan Road Bridge and the Jiangxi Road Bridge. However, the Jiangxi Road Bridge is only allowed for the public carrying mail on foot, and vehicles still have to take the Henan Road Tianhou Palace Bridge. The Japanese army has now set up posts at the eastern end of the northern end of the Henan Road Bridge and at the bridgehead of the waterworks.

### Land Transport is Blocked, Freight is Sharply Reduced, Shanghai-Haiphong Shipping is Interrupted, Taikoo's Sichuan Ship Diverts to Hong Kong, Hong Kong-Haiphong Ferries Still Operate with Many Passengers

Since Japan has stepped up its threats to Vietnam and Hong Kong, the situation between Hong Kong and Vietnam has suddenly become tense. However, shipping between Shanghai and Haiphong is proceeding as usual. Yesterday, news suddenly spread that shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam was interrupted due to blocked land transport and a sharp reduction in freight, resulting in losses for shipping companies. According to a source in the shipping industry interviewed by a reporter from the Pyeongmin News Agency, Jardine Matheson & Co.'s

Tai Sheng sailed to Hong Kong and Haiphong yesterday. Whether the ship can reach Haiphong depends on the situation after arriving in Hong Kong. The ship set sail at 2 p.m. yesterday, carrying more than 300 passengers, including about 100 going to Haiphong. It is also learned from the shipping industry that Taikoo's

Sichuan, which was originally scheduled to depart for Haiphong today, decided to go to Hong Kong only due to the tense situation in Haiphong. According to the shipping industry, the Hong Kong-Haiphong ferries are still operating smoothly. Currently, the Xiao Guangdong and Hai Tan are operating back and forth between Hong Kong and Haiphong. However, due to the extraordinary number of passengers, it is extremely difficult to purchase tickets.

### Land Bureau Files Will Be Handed Over This Morning, No Indication of Protest Against Yu Hongjun, Rumors of Progress in Negotiations on Road Construction Beyond the Border

Regarding the Land Bureau files, due to the concession authorities' concession, it will fall into the hands of the puppet regime. This move by the Public Works Department, whether in terms of law or sentiment, is a move that cannot but make people feel regretful, and the official act of entrusting the custody of this file during the Shanghai war is a violation of the agreement and greatly damages the interests of Chinese and foreign owners in Shanghai. However, when a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency specifically asked Mr. Philip Felling, Director-General of the Public Works Department, about this matter yesterday, he confirmed that the "handover" of the files will take place this morning as reported outside.

Philip Felling Answers Reporter's Questions

The reporter from the Dazhong News Agency first asked Mr. Felling if it was true that the 312 boxes of Land Bureau files would be "handed over" this morning, as rumored outside. Mr. Felling nodded and said, "Yes." The reporter asked about the "handover" procedures, whether the Public Works Department would deliver them to Japanese Consul General Miura. He replied, "Not sure." The reporter said, "Then will the consulates send someone to the Bureau to collect them?" He replied, "Probably so." The reporter further asked whether the Japanese side would transfer the files to the puppet "Municipal Government" after receiving them. Mr. Felling replied, "I don't know." At this point, the reporter asked how the Bureau would respond to Mayor Yu Hongjun's protest. However, Mr. Felling was unwilling to make any comment. The reporter then asked about the assassination of Mu Shiying and whether the puppet "Municipal Government" would protest to the Public Works Department with strong language, and how the Bureau would respond. Mr. Felling said, "Under consideration."

General Situation Reported in Western Newspapers

According to the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, based on the general opinion of city officials, the transfer of the Chinese Land Bureau files by the Public Works Department through Japanese Consul General Miura is rapidly approaching the resolution of several important issues affecting the normal situation in this city. The main outstanding case is the implementation of the agreement between the Public Works Department and the "Municipal Government" and the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession over the area north of the Suzhou River, which will be resolved within a month.

Shanghai West Special Police

According to a source, "Mayor" Chu Xiaonan will submit his final reply within days regarding the establishment of a joint police force for road construction beyond the boundary in western Shanghai. It is understood that Major Bowen, Director of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, has submitted his final proposal for the new police force, and it is now believed that the joint police force will be established soon.

Tax Revenue Issues

At the same time, the Public Works Department has already submitted the names of its representatives to discuss with the "Municipal Government" the second issue in the agreement between the two sides, namely the tax revenue in the road construction area beyond the boundary. The Public Works Department's representatives to discuss this issue will be Philip Felling, Gobi, and Mu Qiu. The "Municipal Government" has not yet announced the names of its representatives, but it is said that their names will be submitted at the beginning of next week to facilitate discussion.

Several Details

The last thing to be considered in the agreement is the jurisdiction of the Chinese court in the Special Zone. Officials believe that this issue is difficult to resolve because there are many technical points related to this issue. This morning, Tsurumi, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, told reporters that discussions between the Japanese authorities and the Public Works Department of the Public Concession on the more complete jurisdiction of the Public Works Department over all areas of the public concession in Binbei are still underway. There are still "many details" to be resolved, but negotiations have made smooth progress.

Land Files

This morning, those responsible for explaining the transfer of land files through the Japanese Consul General said that the Public Works Department received these files from a generally recognized group, and now it is necessary to transfer them to the current "Municipal Government" through a responsible party.

So-called Difficulties

Although the agreement signed by the Public Works Department and the "Municipal Government" in February of this year tacitly recognized the "Municipal Government" de facto, technically speaking, the "Municipal Government" is not a responsible group, and it is possible that both sides will soon make a more concrete form of recognition. The "Mayor" Chu Xiaonan has been cooperating more closely with the Public Works Department authorities, and the Public Works Department also wants to resolve the various difficulties currently encountered in this city.

Yu's Protest

Regarding the files, former Shanghai Mayor Yu Hongjun has protested, but the Public Works Department refused to make any comments on this this morning. According to the above-mentioned files, they were handed over to the Public Works Department for safekeeping by Mayor Yu Hongjun after the retreat of the Chinese army in the Shanghai War of 1937.

### French-Japanese Agreement Reached, French Concession Maintains Status Quo, Ougen Says Neither Will Take Actions Detrimental to the Other

According to the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, it was learned from responsible parties today (the 4th) that the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai have guaranteed the French authorities in the city the integrity of the Shanghai French Concession and the status quo of the area. This compromise was agreed upon by the French and Japanese authorities last week when they discussed incidents affecting the situation in the city. Although Japanese officials refused to comment on this matter this morning, Ougen, the French Consul General in Shanghai, said that the two sides had reached this understanding. "We agreed not to take any actions that would be detrimental to the other party. This is a gentleman's agreement between the Japanese authorities and us."

Negotiated Agreement with Clauses

According to another source, the details of the agreement reached between the French and Japanese authorities on the French Concession issue are that the Japanese authorities, in addition to actually guaranteeing the integrity of the French Concession, also included a "secret clause" in the agreement with the French authorities, stipulating that the status quo of the French Concession will continue to be maintained for a "specified number of years" agreed upon by both parties. Other details are not yet known, but it is said that the authorities will fully cooperate in the future. As for the political issues and the right of the Japanese authorities to participate in the investigation of those engaged in political activities in the French Concession, the French and Japanese authorities have already reached an understanding.

Western Press Commentary, Temporary Relief

According to the English Millard's Review, published today, the unfortunate results of the European war have made French people unable to take care of the situation in the Far East. At this time, French people are supporting their motherland with economic and human resources without reservation. Therefore, the management and defense problems of the French Concession in this city have become increasingly serious. The occurrence of this new situation has led the French authorities to "transfer" the Xujiahui area to the Japanese side. In the

Current environment, maintaining sufficient defense force to protect the French Concession has also become a serious problem. Although the Japanese side is extremely willing to provide "assistance" to the French Concession, the French authorities are obviously trying to use diplomatic means to politely reject the Japanese side's request for "kindness." From the French point of view, France is weak, so it has to use the environment to try its best to maintain the status quo, and in necessary occasions, it has to

Forced to make concessions. Therefore, the former French Consul General Baudouin, who was known for his uncompromising stance against Japan, has resigned due to physical weakness. The current French-Japanese relations can be called "friendly," but at the same time, they are also very tense. The Japanese side is certainly able to break with France at any time, but the Japanese side obviously will not take this step at present, because the current situation is very

Quite favorable to Japan

An important French official said, "Japan is still mired in the quagmire of the war in China, so it only regards the Shanghai French Concession as a delicious food hidden in the refrigerator. When the time comes, it will be ready to eat it leisurely."

### Rice and Grain Evaluation Association Established, Rice from Hong Kong Starts to Ship

Authorities Strictly Prohibit Irregular Transactions

The Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association has resolved to organize the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee, which is responsible for rice and grain evaluation, dredging sources, statistics, investigation, and registration of rice and grain that has arrived and has not arrived. It has already obtained the consent of the two concession authorities, and Chen Ziyi and other 21 people in the soybean and rice industry have been designated as members. The association has now scheduled a founding meeting to be held at 3 p.m. today at No. 15, Rue Edouard VII. In addition to revising and passing the regulations, various important proposals will be discussed to stabilize the rice market in Shanghai as a whole.

Authorities Assist

Yesterday, the Soybean and Rice Industry, the Miscellaneous Grains Industry, and the Rice Store Industry sent Chen Ziyi and others to visit Mr. Ho, the Deputy Director of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, again. Mr. Ho personally received them. First, the representatives reported separately, and then invited the two concession authorities to send personnel to participate and give instructions. In addition to providing assistance, Mr. Ho immediately issued an edict to carry out the work conscientiously. If there are any irregular transactions or secret deals in the future, they must be reported to the authorities for punishment. After bidding farewell to Mr. Ho, the representatives went to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, where they were personally received by Yan E-sheng, the secretary of the Chamber. Mr. Yan has already given them the constitution for examination.

Rice from Hong Kong Starts to Ship

Previously, the Hong Kong authorities, in order to prevent any unexpected events, prepared to forcibly evacuate European women and children in Hong Kong, and ordered the prohibition of ships from exporting in order to evacuate the population, so that the rice-loaded ships could not leave Hong Kong for Shanghai. However, rice speculators in Shanghai were active again, claiming that the source of foreign rice was interrupted, and the market was temporarily bullish and rice prices rose again. Fortunately, the two concession authorities managed to suppress rice prices and cracked down on speculation, and finally managed to maintain the original market. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the rice industry that there were more than 120,000 bags of foreign rice stored in Hong Kong. Now the Hong Kong authorities have allowed ships to export, and the stored rice has been shipped one after another. Within days, Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Tai Sheng and Taikoo & Co.'s Suiyang will have 50,000 bags shipped to Shanghai. As for the four ships that have ordered rice, they have already arrived at the port, carrying more than 20,000 bags of rice.

### German Intelligence Commissioner Denies Peace Talks

The German Embassy in Shanghai quietly reported that Commissioner Koethe, at a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists yesterday, made a statement on the current situation in Europe. He stated that, in military terms, Germany is preparing a new situation to deal with Britain. This work will be completed quickly and thoroughly. This can be seen in the recent activities of

the naval and air forces

in various ports and coasts. Regarding the notice issued by the German Consulate General in Shanghai regarding the conscription of men born in 1911, Mr. Koethe clarified some misunderstandings in the Chinese newspapers. He said that this was based on the military service law promulgated by Germany on May 21, 1935. When a German citizen reaches the age of eighteen, they must

report for inspection.

Those in the country should report to the competent military authorities, and those abroad should report to the local consulate. Finally, a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency asked whether the recent news reports about British-German peace talks were true. The spokesperson stated responsibly that although the rumors of British-German peace talks were published in newspapers, he could

responsibly prove

that this propaganda was definitely not issued by the highest German authorities. Therefore, Germany has followed Britain's lead in denying this news. Since the outbreak of the European war, the so-called Allied countries have all been individually defeated by Germany. Therefore, the current European war situation has become a solo operation by Germany against Britain. How can there be any talk of peace talks?

### Seaport Parcel Service Temporarily Suspended

### Increased Insurance Rates for Merchant Ships; French Territories and French Merchant Ships Refused Coverage; British Insurers Still Fulfilling Terms

Since the outbreak of the European war, the international situation has changed rapidly, and the safety of navigation has become increasingly serious. Insurance companies first stopped accepting war risk insurance for merchant ships traveling to Northern Europe and the Mediterranean. Recently, they have decided to temporarily stop accepting war risk insurance for merchant ships traveling to French territories or directly belonging to France. The war risk insurance rates for ships traveling to other regions have been increased again: (1) Britain and Ireland: 10 yuan per 100 yuan; (2) Africa (south of the equator): 4 yuan per 100 yuan; (3) West Africa (north of the equator): 5 yuan per 100 yuan; (4) Persian Gulf: 3 yuan per 100 yuan; (5) Americas via the Cape of Good Hope: 5 yuan per 100 yuan; (6) Americas via the Panama Canal: 1 yuan per 100 yuan; (7) Americas via the Pacific Ocean: 1 yuan per 100 yuan; (8) Australia: 2 yuan per 100 yuan; (9) China, Japan, Philippines: 1 yuan per 100 yuan; (10) Ports west of Hong Kong (to Singapore and the Dutch East Indies): 1.5 yuan per 100 yuan; (11) Ports west of Singapore and India: 3 yuan per 100 yuan. The above rates are calculated from Hong Kong and have already been implemented.

British Insurance
Business Unchanged

British merchants occupy an important position in the local foreign insurance industry. Since the outbreak of the Second European War, various questions have arisen, and there have been unsettling images between insurance and underwriting. However, during the British House of Commons meeting in February of this year, when Member of Parliament Peter Lawrance asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Simon replied that there would be no changes to the overseas business of British insurance companies and that the terms of the policies would still be fulfilled. The bill is recorded as follows:

Foreign Currency Compensation;
Fulfill According to Policy

Extract from the British House of Commons bill of February 8 this year: Question—Insurance Companies (Overseas Business). Member of Parliament Peter Lawrance (asked) the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the Treasury's financial regulations have any restrictions on the overseas business of British insurance companies, especially for foreign currency compensation. Sir Simon (replied) that the Ministry has a complete plan to ensure that the overseas business of British insurance companies can proceed smoothly and without hindrance, and that compensation for all Allied and neutral countries and British families, whether in British pounds or foreign currency, will be fulfilled according to the terms of their policies.

### Cheap Coal Briquettes Coming Soon

The Shanghai Mechanical Coal Briquette Industry Association held its 36th joint meeting of factory representatives on the 25th of last month and decided to continue to hold the 7th period of cheap coal briquette sales from July 11th, scheduled for ten days, selling until the 20th. As the deadline approaches, the industry association has scheduled the 37th joint meeting of factory representatives to be held at the Tianjin Road Clubhouse at 3 pm on the 9th of this month. At that time, it is expected that the following will be discussed: (1) Please decide on the location for cheap sales; (2) Specify the quantity of briquettes that each person can purchase per purchase, and the selling price. It is understood that all sectors hope that the association will reduce the selling price of non-cheap coal briquettes to lighten the burden on the common people. It has been learned that a large amount has recently arrived and unloaded in the warehouses in Pudong and Puxi, and the freight cost has recently decreased, so the manufacturing cost of coal briquettes has been reduced.

### Rainbow Around the Sun the Day Before Yesterday, Due to Reflected Light from Moist Clouds, Often Found at the North and South Poles

According to the French-language Shanghai Daily, a strange phenomenon was discovered in the sky between 1 and 2 pm the day before yesterday, that is, a rainbow around the sun in the clear and sunny sky. According to some people's speculation, this seems to be related to the future climate, while superstitious people say that there will be huge changes in the situation in Shanghai. According to some experienced Chinese people, this kind of clear rainbow phenomenon should be a harbinger of floods or hurricanes that are about to come, which is also unknown. However, according to a priest at the Xujiahui Observatory, this is probably a kind of solar halo, which is often found at the North and South Poles, but is rarer in Shanghai. According to the priest, the principle of this solar halo is the same as that of a rainbow, that is, there are moist clouds between the ground and sunlight, which form the action of a prism and emit colorful light. According to the priest, this phenomenon is indeed a sign of strong winds, but according to the current observation, there are no hurricanes coming near this port, and the hurricane in the South China Sea is still staying in the Caroline Islands, which is still far from Shanghai.

Cause of Solar Halo

At 1:30 pm on July 3, a colorful strange shape suddenly appeared around the sun. For a time, it was rumored to be a spectacle, but it was actually a solar halo. All kinds of strange light phenomena in the atmosphere are collectively referred to by this term. The source of solar halos is clouds formed by ice crystals, which are reflected by sunlight, just as sunlight rings are formed by water droplets. However, the shape of solar halos changes more than sunlight rings, because the shape of ice crystals is very mixed, so sunlight is reflected by ice crystals and can be refracted in many ways. Solar halos can indicate the nature of clouds. For example, if the sky is pale white, it is not a day of falling sand, but because of thin cirrus clouds. In this kind of weather, solar halos are prone to occur, and they are often a sign of strong winds, as the saying goes, "a lunar halo means wind".

Common Shape

The shape of ordinary solar halos is a ring with an inner radius of about 22 degrees, with red inside, and sometimes yellow, and the remaining colors are mixed and cannot be distinguished. The color in the ring is generally darker and less clear than the sky elsewhere. The outer ring, with a radius of 46 degrees, is lighter in color, but each color can be clearly distinguished, with red inside and purple outside. The above two types are common solar halos, but what is usually seen is that the clouds cover the entire sky unevenly, so it cannot be as clear and beautiful as this time. Lunar halos and solar halos are similar.

### Old Sassoon Firm Sues for Rent Increase; Jicheng Pharmacy and Others Object;

The Public Concession Board of Directors decided to increase land taxes, house taxes, and other taxes starting in the autumn of this year, and has officially announced that it will begin collecting them on July 1. The Waterworks Company had already increased water rates highly last month. The above three taxes have a huge impact on the lives of all citizens, and are also sufficient to cause rent increases. Therefore, recently, Chinese and foreign landlords have been using the excuse that land taxes and water expenses have increased to

propose rent increases

to sub-landlords. The sub-landlords, in turn, are using the increase in house taxes as a reason to notify third-party tenants to increase their rents. These disputes are now in full swing. This morning, Magistrate Mo Runhua heard the case of the British Old Sassoon Firm suing to order Jicheng Pharmacy, Lao Dafang Teashop, and six other households to

increase their rents by 30%

from July of this year to the end of June of next year, and ordered the lawyers of the plaintiff and defendant to transfer their clients to make concessions to each other and conduct reconciliation. However, the lawyer for the tenant immediately explained in court the reasons why the defendant could not accept the rent increase, saying that Old Sassoon had already used the increase in water rates as a disguised rent increase to each defendant twice in the past year. Although it was stated on the rent receipt that the increase was for water expenses, so that the tenants could gain some benefit in terms of paying house taxes, even if the water expenses are expensive, there is a limit.

If increased again,

if discovered by the Tax Office of the Public Concession Board, it would be detrimental to the tenants. Moreover, this is the third rent increase, which is really difficult to accept, etc. The lawyer for the plaintiff stated that the prices of real estate and building materials have all risen in recent years, and other expenses have also increased. It is necessary to increase the rent by 30% to offset the expenses. After the two sides debated, out of respect for the court's advice, they unanimously stated that they would go outside

to try to reconcile. It is said that Old Sassoon Firm has a lot of houses located at the corner of Nanjing Road and Henan Road (i.e., the Ball Field). This time, it is very determined to increase the rent for all tenants. Some tenants have already reached a peaceful resolution under considerable conditions.

### Counterfeit Trademark, Defendant Fined

The Yin Dan Shi Lin cloth trademark issued by the Defu Foreign Firm at 261 Sichuan Road is widely sold and has been legally registered. Recently, in order to reward customers, a gift certificate is attached to each bolt of cloth. If 20 certificates are accumulated, they can be exchanged for a beauty picture from the firm. 250 certificates can be exchanged for five yards of cloth. For the sake of prudence, each gift certificate is stamped with a watermark. Recently, the firm suddenly received a batch of gift certificates from a customer in Wuhu to exchange for gifts, and found that each certificate had no watermark, and knew that it was counterfeit. A staff member was sent to Wuhu to investigate, and it was found that the counterfeit trademark cloth was sold by the Fuji Cotton Cloth Store (owner Yuan Weixiang) at 11, Lane 46, North Wuxi Road in this city. A report was made to the General Patrol Room, which sent detectives to investigate and learned that the counterfeit trademark was commissioned by Chen Guoan, the owner of Renchang Cotton Cloth Store at 12 Jixiang Lane, Henan Road, to Xu Nanhua, a runner at the Xinya Printing Press opened by He Yingjie at 26, Lane 438, Baike Road, to print a total of 55,000 sets, which were sold to Yuan Weixiang of Fuji Cotton Cloth Store by Chen via Huang Rengao, Zhang Lanhe, Xu Arong, and Zhu Yunzhang for mixed sales in the city. The patrol room arrested all the above-mentioned criminals and seized 706 sets of counterfeit trademarks at Fuji Store. The next morning, they were sent to the First Special Court for legal proceedings. After Judge Feng Shide concluded the trial, he announced the judgment in court yesterday morning: "Main text" He Yingjie, Xu Nanhua, and Yuan Zhengxiang jointly intended to deceive others and counterfeit a registered trademark, and were each fined 1,500 yuan. Chen Guoan was guilty of the same crime and was fined 3,000 yuan. Huang Rengao was guilty of the same crime and was fined 800 yuan. If the fine is converted into labor service, the total amount of the fine shall be converted in proportion to the number of days in six months. Zhang Lanhe, Xu Arong, and Zhu Yunzhang were guilty of the same crime and were fined 500 yuan. If the fine is converted into labor service, it shall be converted at the rate of 3 yuan per day. The counterfeit trademarks were confiscated.

### Beating a Foreman to Death; Son of the Criminal Arrested and Sentenced

Feng Amao (42 years old), a native of Shaoxing who worked as a foreman at the British-owned Lulin Printing Company at 531 Avenue Pétain, was highly trusted by the company's manager. In November of last year, the workers asked Feng to ask the manager to increase wages and provide rice subsidies, etc. Feng did not comply, which angered the crowd. On the 15th, a strike was carried out. At 7 am that morning, Feng Amao went from home to the company. When passing near Jingzhou Road and Huade Road, he was surrounded and brutally beaten by more than 20 workers with iron objects and tap water pipes, and died from his injuries. The murderers fled without a trace. Until 1:30 pm on June 13 of this year, Tang Guangfu, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Patrol Room, received a tip and arrested three suspects, Hu Akang, Wang Songhe, and Kong Qingxiang, all natives of Ningbo, in the vicinity of Avenue Pétain and Dalianwan Road. They were sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Huang Risheng conducted a thorough investigation and remanded the three defendants for sentencing. Yesterday morning, the patrol room sent the three criminals Hu, Wang, and Kong to the Third Criminal Court. Patrol Room lawyer Zhang Tianyin stood up to wait for instructions. Judge Huang announced the verdict: Hu Akang and Wang Songhe were sentenced to seven years of imprisonment each for causing death by injury. Kong Qingxiang was sentenced to five months of public warning for aiding and abetting the same crime.

### Examination of the Manchurian Situation (2)

Fifteen hundred li northeast of Ningguta, on both banks of the Su Song River and the Hun Tong River, is called He Zhe Kara, and four or five hundred li further northeast, residing around the confluence of the Wu Su Li, Songhua, and Hun Tong rivers, is also called He Zhe Kara, which is also the dog country. Further northeast, crossing the Hun Tong River seven or eight hundred li, is called Fei Ya Ha, all the way to the northeast coast, three thousand li from Ningguta, is called Qi Le Er, which is the deer country. These are all on the northern route. Going upstream from the Hun Tong River to the north of the Heilong River, at the foot of the Outer Khingan Mountains, between Russia and the Khalkha Mongols, there is the Solon tribe. Around the Nen River, there are the Xibe, Gualeza, and other tribes. These are all hunting and gathering tribes, interspersed between the Mongols, relying on this to defend against strong neighbors and protect China internally. Those who live in Jilin today are not all Manchus. Each follows the customs of their tribe. The Han people are from all thirteen provinces, and many have been exiled here. They also each follow their own customs. The city walls are made of bricks and stones, surrounded by wooden fences two or three li long, which is called a city fence. The Eight Banners reside inside, and scholars and officials who have been demoted also live among them. The rest are scattered in various villages. In the early days of the dynasty, the customs of the people were docile and simple, and no one picked up lost items on the road. Traveling hundreds of li, one did not need to carry provisions or buy forage, and traded with millet and cloth. But recently, the atmosphere has gradually changed, and it is no longer as it used to be. In the early days of the dynasty, the Manchus were brave and good at fighting. There was a saying that getting a Korean talent was not as good as getting a Mongol, getting a Mongol was not as good as getting a Manchu.

Spring and Autumn

### Bargain Clothing for the Week

— Fitting Hope

The oppression of life truly makes one breathless. Although one is determined to live by the motto of saving on food and clothing, one cannot save to the point of having nothing in the stomach, and one must ensure one is adequately clothed. In the third summer after the war, my summer clothes were truly no longer suitable for wearing to the office. After careful consideration, I decided to abandon Western suits and switch to Chinese attire. This is because the materials for Western suits are all so-called "imported goods." Converting the limited legal tender into foreign exchange prices, the cost of making a Western suit might truly leave the entire family with nothing to digest. As for Chinese attire, naturally, one can forget about materials like silk and satin. Even the most basic fabrics are frighteningly "rising" amidst the "phone calls" of speculative friends. So, although the plan was decided, after visiting several silk and satin shops and cloth stores, I still hesitated to "execute" it. Eventually, I became foolishly reading the advertisements in the newspaper every day, hoping to stumble upon a big bargain opportunity that disregarded all costs. As fate would have it, one Sunday morning, I discovered a rare opportunity. Calculating from the prices in the advertisement, making a long gown and two sets of shirts and trousers would probably cost less than twenty yuan, including tailoring. So, disregarding the fact that it was a day of rest, I got up early and rushed to buy the bargain goods. However, I returned disappointed because they were "sold out!"

Bargain goods are naturally sought after by everyone, so they are only available for a short time on Sunday mornings. However, since an advertisement has been placed, one cannot be casual, or even close to deceptive, because I believe I arrived "early" that day. The fact that they were "sold out" cannot help but make people suspect that there were no bargain goods for sale at all.

The silk and satin shops and cloth stores after the war can be said to be making money. Sacrificing a few types of clothing materials every Sunday morning would not be cheap to the point of losing money. So why use deceptive tactics to make fun of poor friends? At the same time, this is detrimental to commercial ethics and a suicidal policy that destroys one's own credibility! Therefore, if you are truly sincere in making sacrifices, you should at least set a time and sell as much as possible within the specified time. Otherwise, simply sell expensive clothing materials, and the poor have no way to access them!

As the saying goes, "Big belly in a famine year." This saying is actually based on sound scientific principles. First: In years of rice shortage, other foods will certainly not be cheap. As a result of eating fewer snacks and miscellaneous foods, one naturally eats more rice. Second: Rice is expensive, as are meat, oil, and various vegetables. Rice cannot be saved, so one has to save on side dishes. Eating fewer side dishes means eating more rice. At the same time, with the reduction of meat and oil, the stomach lacks fat, and digestion is quick and easy. In other words, one gets hungrier and can eat more rice.

Having a big belly in a famine year is truly a great misfortune within misfortune. But everywhere you look, there are "maggots" who only care about their own bellies and not the bellies of the public. Alas!

Hawthorne's Investigation

### The Final Destination of the Dancing Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Two: "A Page of History!"

I already have a considerable understanding of Jinmei's thoughts. Her tone clearly puts the suspicion on Zhao Boxiong, while trying her best to exonerate Yu Gantang. In fact, one can discern her psychological loves and hates simply by listening to her different ways of addressing these two people. But why is she like this?

I couldn't help but interject, "Since Miss Wang spoke up for Zhao Boxiong when they were arguing, it's clear that her feelings for the Zhao fellow are closer than for the Yu fellow. Then why did the Zhao fellow seem to want to make things difficult for her last night?"

Jinmei only glanced at me sideways, lowered her head, and stared at the carpet, ignoring me.

Ni Jinshou also agreed with my view and continued, "That's right! This doesn't make sense. Jinmei, what do you say?"

She simply replied, "I don't know."

Hawthorne seemed uninterested in our questions. He continued to ask, "Jinmei, did Yu Gantang come yesterday after all?"

She still shook her head and said, "No." She was still admiring the pattern on the carpet.

Hawthorne stared at her, and his tone became heavier. "You'd better tell the truth."

Jinmei reluctantly said, "I don't know."

"That's right. Yu Gantang may have come yesterday, but you didn't know. Right?...Okay, what kind of business does Yu Gantang do?"

"He doesn't do business. He studies at Jiangnan University."

"Oh, a college student!" He was silent for a moment, seemingly sighing to himself. Then he suddenly seemed to remember a new topic. "Ah, I forgot, when you and Master Li heard the gunshot last night and went downstairs, what about the old woman?"

Jinmei replied, "She was still in her room and hadn't come out."

"Does she also live on the third floor?"

"No, she sleeps downstairs behind the kitchen."

"Didn't she hear the gunshot?"

"She said she didn't hear it. It wasn't until Old Mao went out to find Manager Lu and Miss Jiang that I went into Wu Ma's room to wake her up." (35)

### Moore Memorial Church Raises Rice Price; Appeals on Behalf of the Poor

— Wei Kang

The Moore Memorial Church on Yu Qiaqing Road in this city, due to soaring rice prices and the difficult lives of the poor, began selling affordable rice before the New Year at a price of one jiao per catty in national currency. It was sold every morning, greatly benefiting the poor. This was truly a significant act. However, "there were more monks than porridge," and the rice was often insufficient to distribute, so most people who came every day left empty-handed. Recently, we suddenly heard that the church, due to the large number of poor people buying rice, decided to slightly increase the selling price from today onwards to limit the number of buyers, raising it to 1.5 jiao per catty in national currency. We were very surprised to hear this move by the church, and at the same time, we cannot help but appeal on behalf of the poor!

The reason given by the Moore Memorial Church for raising the price is to limit the number of people, but please think carefully, what will happen to the group of poor people who are eliminated under the 1.5 jiao price? The even more tragic consequences are imaginable. Isn't this contrary to the Moore Memorial Church's main purpose of selling rice to help the poor?

Therefore, we cannot help but ask the Moore Memorial Church to consider this carefully, because "limiting the number of people and raising the price" is not a good solution, and it cannot be regarded as a reason for raising the price! At the same time, we hope that Shanghai philanthropists and charitable organizations will quickly find ways to jointly support the Moore Memorial Church's charitable act of selling rice at affordable prices to help the poor, so that it can always achieve the purpose of benefiting the poor.

### Correction to "Subsidies for Impoverished Students"

— Wang Pei

In Mr. Simon's article "The YMCA and YWCA Subsidize Impoverished Students" published in this newspaper on the 3rd, there were some slight errors. As I am a recipient of the association's subsidy, I have more detailed knowledge and would like to supplement and correct it as follows:

The association was founded in the autumn of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), after the "August 13th" Incident. Its purpose is to subsidize outstanding students in Shanghai who have been affected by the war, so that they can continue their studies. It is named "Shanghai Student Relief Committee". The funds are raised by the YMCA and YWCA from American churches and schools.

The subsidy amount is 50 yuan per high school student and 70 yuan per student above the junior college level. (Mr. Simon mentioned 30 yuan for high school students and 50 yuan for junior college students. This was the subsidy amount for the previous session. This session, due to increased tuition fees in various schools, the subsidy has also been increased.) Students applying for subsidies can pick up the "Application Form for Relief Students" at the Student Life Mutual Aid Society of the YWCA on Jing'an Temple Road from July 1st. There are no other procedures for picking up the form. The form must be submitted in person with transcripts or other supporting documents and two photos before the 8th. (It is best to submit it before the 6th, as the association will hold an exam on the 9th of this month, and it will be closed on the 7th. Submitting it on the 8th may be too rushed.) The more detailed the form is filled out, the better, because if it is filled out too simply, the committee will have no way of knowing whether the family is impoverished and whether the student's character and academic performance are excellent. In particular, the applicant's special skills, extracurricular activities, what kind of books and magazines they read outside of school, and the family's economic situation are more important. And the applicant's economic budget for the next semester must be detailed in order to know whether the applicant needs a subsidy. An admission ticket can be picked up upon submission of the form. The exam location is Jiang University on the sixth floor of the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road, and the time is from 7 pm to 9 pm on July 9th. The exam content is nothing more than general knowledge and current affairs. The results will be announced about a week after the exam. Those who pass the preliminary exam must take a second exam (oral exam), and those who pass the second exam can receive the subsidy. Subsidized students must perform several hours of volunteer work each week.

The association originally subsidized 200 students (half for junior colleges and universities, and half for high schools). Now, because the number of out-of-school youth in Shanghai is increasing, this session will add 100 students, enrolling 150 high school students and 150 university and junior college students. Students in need of subsidies can quickly pick up the form, because the form still needs to be stamped by the school, guarantor, and parents, and picking it up too late may not allow enough time to complete the procedures.

### Respectfully Questioning the YMCA Student Department

— Xu Fei

In May, the YMCA Student Department held an essay contest. The topic was "Shanghai Students Today". The genre was divided into novels, reports, essays, etc. The deadline was May 20th. The top ten winners each received book vouchers worth five yuan and were eligible to apply for tuition subsidies for the next semester. Those who were ranked after the tenth or were not selected would also receive a copy of the compilation "Shanghai Students Today". The announcement date was June 1st. The news of this essay contest was published in various newspapers. The various schools also received the regulations sent by the association. At that time, I wrote an essay and sent it. However, the results were not announced on June 1st. Afterwards, I eagerly turned over the newspapers every day and inquired with friends close to the YMCA, but there was no news. An old classmate told me that he had only heard of an essay contest for Christians, but not one for "Shanghai Students Today," and that it had already ended, and that he knew nothing else. Therefore, in addition to guessing, I wrote directly to the YMCA Student Department to inquire, but still received no reply. Now that July 1st has also passed, the results have still not been announced.

Therefore, I must sincerely ask the officials of the YMCA Student Department to publicly reply: What exactly is going on with this essay contest? When will the results be announced? (Repaid)

### Epidemic Prevention and Disinfection

— Plum

Mr. Kuang Xihua's article "Getting Vaccinated" can be said to explain in great detail what vaccinations are for those who generally do not understand them. At the beginning of this scorching summer, everyone can get vaccinated without hesitation. However, the white-clad angels administering vaccinations on the street are a bit too perfunctory. For example, they take a tube of medicine, grab passersby, and inject them under the skin one after another, without paying attention to the amount, and without wiping the needle neck with alcohol for disinfection. In this easy negligence, it may lead to unfortunate consequences. On the other hand, we naturally forgive them, because there are too many passersby on the street, and they cannot inject as calmly as in a hospital. But paying attention to the following two points is not very troublesome: too much injected medicine is not suitable; and the needle should be disinfected after each injection. This is the responsibility of every doctor, and should not be neglected because it is fulfilling an obligation.

Entertainment World

### The World Changes in an Instant: The Difficulty of Filming Current Events

— New Film

Hollywood film companies have recently wanted to shoot some current events films, but international events are changing too quickly. When a film company has finished writing a script and wants to start filming, the international situation has completely changed, and it has to change its plans and stop filming. As a result, the only film related to European current events currently being filmed in Hollywood is Paramount's "Mystery Ship." Although this film depicts a naval battle near Uruguay, it includes a battle in the North Sea.

Indeed, Hollywood has many stories that narrate scenes of the European war, especially German Nazism, such as MGM's "Escape" and "Mortal Storm." These all belong to this category of films.

Universal has a new film, the story of which is taken from war news, and was completed when the Finnish war ended. It is called "Sea Patrol." This trend is now common in Hollywood, the film city. Generally, film companies want to find subject matter from newspapers, turn current events into stories, and shoot films. The only drawback is that international events really change too quickly, and even if film companies use the most agile means, they sometimes cannot film time-sensitive films in time.

Under these circumstances, Hollywood screenwriters have been "particularly busy recently. When they discover new events that can be used as film material, they quickly write scripts based on news reports under the company's authorization, so that the company can quickly shoot the films. This trend has become particularly evident since the outbreak of the European War in September last year!

### The Theatrical Life of Tang Ruoying

— Feng Ling

This seems to require no introduction. As for Miss Tang Ruoying, because of her family's background, her theatrical life must be very fulfilling. Sure enough, when I met Miss Ruoying and talked to her once, my ideal was completely confirmed:

Before the flames of the August 13th War broke out, she was comfortably studying at Qixiu Girls' High School on North Sichuan Road in Hongkou. After graduating, she was preparing to enter Soochow University in Suzhou, and had already been accepted. Unexpectedly, the war broke out, and the whole family traveled around with the troupe, performing and striving to promote the essence of drama. Naturally, she also followed. When she was studying, because of her inherited nature, she had a very strong interest in drama, and often performed short one-act plays in the name of the school troupe, but she had never officially stepped onto the stage.

When they arrived in Hankou, they lived there for a long time. She studied at a girls' school and formally engaged in theatrical life. The first play she performed in was "Green Yarn Tent," written by Mr. Ouyang Yuqian. Later, she went to Hong Kong, where she worked alone in Guilin for about half a year. Therefore, she played the leading roles in the China Travel Theater's "Night Light Cup," "Thunderstorm," and "Sunrise." In the blink of an eye, it has been more than a year and a half.

Now, she is studying at the Faculty of Arts of Aurora University. Because it is summer vacation, she can take some time to guest-star in various plays. In this "Female Shopkeeper," she plays the leading role of Du Jiuniang, the female shopkeeper. The story is very humorous and funny, and she performs purely in a comedic style, which can be said to suit her personality.

### Parachute Troops on the Silver Screen

— New

In this European war, the German parachute troops have been praised by the whole world with surprise and admiration. Everyone is eager to know how Germany is training these awe-inspiring soldiers.

Now, regarding this issue, Germany has already made a film. At the beginning of June, when the Berlin authorities were hosting foreign journalists, they introduced this film to them. It is said that it will soon be shown in theaters everywhere.

After watching the film, anyone will be more interested in the term "parachute troops." It turns out that parachute troops first need to undergo army training. They are required to do an indoor exercise every day, which is to practice somersaults on thick blankets. For the skills of jumping from an airplane, the practice method is to jump from high buildings into sand pits that have been dug on the ground. In addition, several other cumulative courses must also be taught to each paratrooper. The most important thing is how to handle themselves freely during the landing process. The last part of the film is about showing their divine power. They use light weapons that are packed in boxes and dropped from the plane at the same time when they land. The parachute troops on the screen can also be said to have recorded an unprecedented miracle in the film industry!

### Tang Jie and Zhu Bingxin — There is a Possibility of Renewing Old Bonds

— Taigong

Tang Jie, known in the film industry for his "Mr. Wang" film, entered the film circle when he was only nineteen years old. Speaking of history, it is actually quite long.

The matter between Tang Jie and Zhu Bingxin has been going on for a long time. Later, due to some relationship, the two broke off their relationship and separated. Now, Zhu Bingxin is in Hong Kong, engaged in hugging for a living.

Yesterday, I met Tang Jie on the road. During the conversation, I learned that Tang Jie had never forgotten Zhu Bingxin. According to Tang, he had recently sent a letter to Zhu Bingxin in Hong Kong, explaining his love and that he had never forgotten her for a day. A few days after this letter was sent, Tang Jie received a reply from Zhu, saying that it was not impossible for her to return to Shanghai and renew their old relationship, and that she was also very happy, but she would have to wait two months before she could put it into practice. The reason was not explained in the letter.

Judging from this, the renewal of old bonds between Tang Jie and Zhu Bingxin can be achieved very smoothly. Then let's wait and see the renewal of old dreams between Tang and Zhu in two months.

### Quirks of Hollywood Stars

— Wen Qin

Although Miram Lona is young, she likes to call people "kids." When you are in a restaurant and suddenly hear an out-of-tune and funny whistle, followed by a sound like splitting bamboo: "Hey! Kid!"—this is to let you know that the film emperor has arrived.

If you see a tall, thin man at a gas station on the road, insisting on putting the gasoline into the car himself, only Warm Morris, the protagonist of "Giant Valley," has such a quirk.

The taciturn Gary Cooper likes to light a cigarette alone in a nightclub, concentrating and meditating, and constantly rubbing his nose (we can also appreciate this expression on the screen from time to time).

Heidi Lamarr has a strange makeup technique: she likes to apply rouge near her nostrils, which is said to make her look particularly beautiful.

Penny Lan, who jumped to become one of Hollywood's top ten stars in 1939, loves to eat onion and meat bread, and must chew gum after eating.

The so-called hot man, Charles Boyer, does not want to play poker with any woman.

Singing star Alan Smith always asks the band conductor to play his favorite song, "Star Dust."

George Brent likes to wear shirts with the collar turned up and without a tie.

Penny Barrence's right thumb nail is often painted with a small British emblem, but it is not visible without careful attention.
