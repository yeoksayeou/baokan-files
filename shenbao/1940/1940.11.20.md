### U.S. State Department Denies Military Agreement with Thailand, U.S. Observers See Japan's Weakness Exposed, Mao Bangchu in U.S. for Aircraft Purchase Negotiations

Washington:  Yesterday, a U.S. State Department assistant, Mr. Welles, in a meeting with reporters, denied the report from a Japanese news agency that Britain, the U.S., and Thailand had concluded a secret military agreement, saying the report was completely unfounded and untrue. He believed it was deliberately fabricated. People here say that the European Axis powers often accuse countries they intend to invade of unfriendly acts as a pretext for future aggression. Japan is now attempting to imitate this strategy by spreading this rumor. However, such a scheme cannot deceive the U.S., as Americans are paying close attention to the development of the situation and are still studying the reasons for the Japanese army's withdrawal from southern China. Yesterday, a newspaper reported that the reasons given by the Japanese for withdrawing from Guangdong and Guangxi were bizarre and incredible. The real reason is that they had too much in their mouths to swallow, so they quickly spit it out. News from Tokyo that the Imperial Conference had decided to give Chongqing a final opportunity to reconsider its attitude and negotiate peace with Japan is also seen here as a sign of Japan's weakness. In 1938, Japan formally declared that it would destroy the Chiang government and would never negotiate with it. This attitude is in stark contrast to recent reports that Japan will offer Chongqing generous peace terms. From this, it can be seen that Japan is now aware that its future is uncertain, unlike two years ago. The threat issued by Japan that if Chongqing refuses to negotiate, Japan will recognize the puppet government in Nanjing, is not enough to move Chongqing in the eyes of people here. Based on all the evidence, Chongqing is determined to fight a long-term war. The Chongqing Air Force Mission, led by General Mao Bangchu, is currently here. Although government officials have not made any statements about this mission, it is heard from responsible parties that Mao Bangchu hopes to conduct negotiations to purchase fighter planes with the assistance of Hu Shih, the Chinese ambassador to the U.S., and Song Ziwen, a Chinese financier in the U.S., in order to use these fighter planes to prevent Japanese attacks on Chongqing, Kunming, and the滇緬 Highway.

If British-American-Thai Agreement is Established, Japan's Ambitions to Advance Southward Will Be Thwarted

Chongqing:  This morning, all Chinese newspapers in Chongqing prominently published the news from Japan that Britain, the U.S., and Thailand had concluded a defense agreement without comment. Chinese communities have not received official news regarding this matter, but of course, are paying attention to this development. According to observers, if this agreement is concluded, Japan's ambition to advance southward will suffer a severe blow. If Thailand cooperates with Japan, Japan can use Thailand as a base to threaten Singapore and Burma, which is very beneficial to Japan's plans. If Thailand joins hands with Britain and the U.S., Japan will find it difficult to advance overland to the Burma Road and will have to attack Singapore by sea, which is not an easy task.

Situation in the Far East Deteriorating, Prospects for U.S.-Japan Relations Bleak

Honolulu:  Mr. Fleisher, former editor of the "Japan Advertiser," recently returned to the U.S. from Japan on the "President Coolidge." Yesterday, he passed through Honolulu and told reporters that the general situation in the Far East is very bad and is likely to worsen. He said that a U.S.-Japan war is not impossible, but the opportunity for Japan to improve relations with the U.S. is very slim. Mr. Fleisher also said, "Before I left Japan, I met with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke. The Foreign Minister also felt that there was little hope of resolving the U.S.-Japan dispute. The Foreign Minister believes that establishing peace with China is easier to achieve than peace with the U.S. Whether a conflict will occur in the Pacific depends on the outcome of the European war. If the Rome-Berlin Axis wins in Europe, Japan will definitely move forward to implement its southward program." Mr. Fleisher added that he believes Japan will disregard Washington's warnings and proceed with its southward plan. He also said that Japan is prepared to deal with all the consequences of this move. For the time being, Japan is trying to wait for an opportunity to conclude a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union first. Mr. Fleisher concluded that the U.S. withdrawal of expatriates from the Far East has made a deep impression on the minds of ordinary Japanese. (United Press, 19th)

Japanese Newspapers Claim British and American Activities in Thailand and Vietnam are Overt Challenges

Tokyo:  Today, the Kokumin Shimbun published an article stating that regardless of whether the Bangkok news regarding the conclusion of a three-nation agreement between Thailand, Britain, and the U.S. has been proven, the offensive taken by Britain and the U.S. in the areas proposed for the construction of a new order in East Asia in the past few months is undeniable. The newspaper believes that the appointment of British Air Force Lieutenant General Sir Brooke-Popham as Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Far East is a meaningful sign of this British-American offensive, stating that British and American activities in Thailand and southern Vietnam (including Saigon) are the most overt challenge to the construction of a new order in East Asia. In terms of the situation, the Japanese government should have a strong determination to crush the British-American offensive against Japan, and should not only make empty gestures, such as the establishment of the South Seas Affairs Bureau by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, or the elevation of the Japanese legation in Bangkok to an embassy, or the presentation of protests to the Thai government. The Asahi Shimbun also warned Thailand that it has only one path to follow, which is to participate in the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, because the current international situation is undoubtedly trending towards the organization of regional blocs. Any country in East Asia that attempts to rely on the British and American forces is merely going against the times. The newspaper also warned the Japanese government and people to be careful to prevent Thailand and Saigon from becoming the vanguard of the joint British and American offensive in the old South Pacific. (Reuters, 19th)

Tokyo:  Tokyo newspapers today all carried passionate editorials, based on widespread reports that Britain and the U.S. had concluded a secret military agreement with Thailand, launching a major attack on Britain and the U.S. The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun editorial stated, "Thailand's request to Vietnam for the return of lost territory is very reasonable, but the guarantees provided by Britain and the U.S. are actually only intended to make Thailand a fortress for defending Burma and the Malay Peninsula, as a line of defense to prevent Japan's southward advance." The Asahi Shimbun warned Thailand that Thailand must cooperate with Japan, or it will suffer the consequences. The newspaper stated, "We must warn Thailand that it has only one path to follow. What is that path? That is to participate in the work of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere by Japan. What we are most concerned about now is that Thailand is being lured by the sweet words of Britain and the U.S." The Asahi Shimbun went on to say that Britain and the U.S. are now taking a tough stance towards the Far East, stating, "We must complete all preparations. In addition to quickly resolving the important events in China, we must also pay close attention to the South." The Kokumin Shimbun regarded all the alleged activities of Britain and the U.S. in Thailand as "enemy behavior against Asian countries." (Associated Press, 19th)

Over 10,000 residents of Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a Cambodian protectorate, held demonstrations yesterday in the city of Battambang, the center of the rice-producing area in the west.

### Vietnamese Merchants Request Trade with Britain, Japan Seeks to Monopolize Rubber Production

Hong Kong:  According to sources from Haiphong, the Association of European Importers in Vietnam has issued a statement emphasizing the importance of trade between Vietnam and Singapore and Hong Kong. The statement said that if the current ban on trade between Vietnam and British colonies continues, Vietnam will inevitably suffer adverse effects. Factories in Indochina lack essential supplies and rely on supplies from the U.S. The report also said that France is unable to supply Vietnam's needs at this time, and Japan is busy manufacturing military equipment. Without India or Singapore supplying gunny sacks, the 20 million tons of rice produced in Vietnam will have no way to survive, which will inevitably lead to widespread failure. Visitors from Haiphong also said that the Japanese economic delegation in Vietnam has requested a three-month monopoly on Vietnamese rubber production starting on December 1, which is said to have been allowed by the authorities. They also said that the Japanese have also requested a monopoly on mining. They also said that customs issues are of the greatest concern to the Japanese. Therefore, the Japanese have used the recent U.S. chartering of the "Dublin" and "Xijiang" ships as a pretext to demand the management of the entire Vietnamese customs. However, although the Saigon customs issue is still under discussion at this time, the Japanese seem to have abandoned their request. (Associated Press, 19th)

### Anti-Japanese Sentiment in Dutch East Indies Intensifying

Tokyo:  According to the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" yesterday, anti-Japanese sentiment in the Dutch East Indies is intensifying.

The Japanese government should immediately consider the issue of subsidies. The newspaper continued that Japan should immediately take appropriate countermeasures to eliminate the British and American forces in the Dutch East Indies. (Dentsu, 19th)

Editorial

### Japan Under the New International Situation

In its years of competing internationally, Japan found itself isolated and helpless, and was thus forced to sign a pact with Germany and Italy. This is the last card in Japan's diplomatic hand; from this point on, it completely relinquished its initiative and maneuvering in diplomacy. If it does not voluntarily retreat a few steps, then it must prepare for the coming showdown with British and American power. At the same time, Britain and the United States are actively emphasizing their opposition to the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" on the one hand, while preparing to accept Japan's challenge on the other.

According to general speculation, Japan might launch new large-scale military adventures after allying with Germany and Italy; but the facts show that it is instead hesitant and coy. Why is this? Because in the fifty days since the Tripartite Pact was signed, the European war situation and the international atmosphere have made great strides. This is reflected deeply in the Far East; yet everything has been unexpected by Japan, leading to a loss of direction.

It is worth remembering that last year, when the Abe cabinet was in power, in an attempt to ease American public opinion and maintain the US-Japan commercial treaty that was about to expire, it vaguely expressed to the US government its willingness to restore peace with China, in order to test America's attitude. International public opinion immediately responded, pointing out that its motive was that if the United States were to inquire about China's opinion and receive a negative response, Japan would be able to justify itself and place the responsibility for prolonging the war on China, and then demand that the US-Japan commercial treaty remain valid. The US government also saw through this and refused to act as a tool for it to send signals. This drama that never played out seems to be what Tokyo is trying to stage again these days. It has not noticed that its intentions are well known; it has not noticed that the determination and quality of US aid to China is demonstrating the strong spirit of US Far East policy; yet it is confused and still wants to use this little trick to alleviate the warmth and effort of US aid to China. According to a Reuters dispatch, Matsuoka "asked the United States not to take any action to hinder Japan's peace efforts or encourage Chongqing to continue to resist Japan's aggression." This can be said to be a talk that reveals its true intentions. However, it precisely proves that the various kinds of assistance that the United States is giving to China are unbearable for Japan.

As for Japan's so-called "southward advance," Japan absolutely does not want to take this great risk while the Sino-Japanese War continues. This is the most fundamental principle. However, there is a contradictory key in the middle that almost makes the Tripartite Alliance equivalent to waste paper. That is, Germany and Italy hope that Japan will immediately advance southward and create a powerful disturbance behind Britain; if Japan is willing to do this, the sooner the better, so as to catch Britain and the United States off guard. If the Japanese navy can break through and appear in the Indian Ocean, and occupy Hong Kong, Singapore and other places in one fell swoop, and control India and Suez, then the British Empire that Germany wants to crush would be half dead, wouldn't that be wonderful. However, Japan hopes that Germany and Italy will first deal a fatal blow to the British Empire in Europe and the Mediterranean, and then Japan will flex its muscles against Britain in the East. Unexpectedly, Germany and Italy's strategy of attacking Britain has gradually become weak, and the United States is cooperating with Britain to devote itself to the Far East. Not only that, but Britain has the strength to strengthen Singapore's defenses and establish a Far East military region, in addition to dealing with Germany and Italy in Europe and the Mediterranean. This is what Japan is most concerned about after the Tripartite Alliance. Originally, Japan did not dare to easily provoke the United States, but in terms of naval strategy, it is not absolutely impossible to fight a war: Japan only needs to launch a surprise attack on the US fleet while it is sailing towards the Far East, to avoid waiting for it to reach ports such as Hawaii and Manila. Extend the war to the vicinity of the Japanese islands. Therefore, when the US fleet announced its departure for the Far East, Japan tried to intimidate it, because from a strategic point of view, the possibility of a US-Japan war breaking out at that time was quite large. However, Japan did not take any risky actions, and sat idly by as US Far East defenses became more and more complete. Now, as time goes on, the British and American maritime encirclement of Japan is shrinking and strengthening day by day, and the so-called "southward advance" of Japan is also gradually decreasing.

Japan, in this situation of being unable to advance or retreat, its only fantasy. The big one is still to obtain some kind of understanding from the Soviet Union through Germany; but as a result of the Soviet-German meeting, Japan has already felt that it has been hit hard again. Thinking about Japan's future, it is to either make a desperate bet, display its seppuku spirit, or repent and thoroughly reform; apart from that, I don't see any room for maneuver.

### Various Parties Remain Silent on Rumors of Peace Negotiations, Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Refuses to Comment, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Also Makes No Statement

Chongqing:  Political figures here are not interested in reports that Japan has decided to launch a peace offensive against China, because China's position is clear and will never change. Although Japan wants to end the war with China, it will never be able to offer conditions acceptable to China. Therefore, it can be asserted that the so-called peace offensive is meaningless and ineffective. (Havas, 18th)

Tokyo:  The Foreign Ministry spokesman today refused to confirm or deny reports that the Japanese government intends to negotiate a peace agreement directly with Chongqing.

According to the announcement, the Imperial Conference discussed various issues regarding the emergency situation in China, and unanimous agreement had been reached on the issues raised for discussion. The spokesman also said that General Abe's return to Nanjing was a proper move to complete his mission. Today, Japanese newspapers have not indicated the possibility of Japan and Chongqing opening negotiations. It is reported that U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew had learned of the Japanese government's decision to negotiate directly. The ambassador, of course, remained silent on this matter and made no statement. (Reuters, 19th)

### Italian Newspaper Discusses Far Eastern Situation

Rome Italian political commentator Bagiini wrote in "Il Popolo d'Italia" yesterday that the understanding between Germany and the Soviet Union has prevented the United Kingdom and the United States from undermining the Tripartite Pact and defeating Japan in the Far East. He said that the understanding between Germany and the Soviet Union has broken the United Kingdom and the United States' plan to enlist the Soviet Union to jointly deal with the three countries. This plan was conceived by the United Kingdom and supported by the United States. Bagiini criticized President Roosevelt's attempt to weaken Japan's military apparatus and influence Soviet policy by imposing an embargo on scrap iron to Japan. He said, "The United Kingdom's powerful and contradictory plan to undermine this situation and ensure its victory has been shattered by the German-Soviet understanding in Berlin. The United Kingdom's plan aimed to create an Anglo-Soviet agreement to overwhelm Japan in the East and deprive the Soviet Union of assistance to the Axis powers in the West, and to abolish the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan. The United Kingdom will soon obtain the necessary raw materials, and its transportation across the Atlantic has been greatly hampered by the Axis powers' naval and air blockade. The Soviet government has remained indifferent, so the United Kingdom has requested diplomatic assistance from the United States, and has quickly obtained it. Soviet Ambassador to Washington Oumansky was urgently summoned to the State Department, where he was received by Under Secretary Welles. Mr. Welles indicated that if the Soviet Union agreed to supply raw materials to Chiang Kai-shek, the United States would be willing to assist the Soviet Union's desire in the Far East and economic cooperation in order to promote Japan's defeat. It is reported that President Roosevelt has shown the Soviet Union the United States' power to economically and militarily compel Japan to exhaustion, and has attempted to influence Moscow's policy by imposing an embargo on scrap iron to Japan."

### U.S. Government Considers Expanding Funds Freezing Measures, Excluding China and the United Kingdom

Washington There is a proposal to expand the measures preventing the flow of foreign funds in the United States in order to suppress the Axis countries and assist China and the United Kingdom. The assets of foreigners should not be limited to those controlled by the Axis countries but should all be "frozen." However, China, the United Kingdom, and other countries should be allowed to liquidate. Japan can continue to import silk into the United States, but the dollars it earns from sales will be immediately frozen and cannot flow out without obtaining a license. The purpose of this measure is to prevent the people of the Axis countries from using remittances from Switzerland or Yugoslavia to return home. Officials are currently discussing this proposal.

### German-Italian-Spanish Conference Ends, Axis Powers' Focus Shifts Back to the Balkans, Central European Conference to be Held in Vienna, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria All Invited to Participate

According to informed sources, the so-called Central European Conference will be held in Vienna in a few days, and Prime Minister Teleki and Foreign Minister Csaky will represent Hungary at the conference. The conference will discuss the new order in Europe, and the participants will include Germany, Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, and possibly Yugoslavia. (19th Reuters dispatch)

Berlin German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will arrive in Vienna today. Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki and Hungarian Foreign Minister Count Csaky will arrive in Vienna tomorrow. (19th Haitian News Agency dispatch)

Berlin Observers here believe that the meetings between German Chancellor Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, and Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer in Salzburg and Berchtesgaden indicate that the Axis powers' second diplomatic offensive, the first being initiated with the signing of the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact and ending with the Soviet Foreign Minister's visit to Germany, is progressing more rapidly than expected. Reliable sources believe that the focus of the situation will shift to Vienna in the coming days, where Germany and Italy will consult with representatives from Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania within this week. The Romanian representative will be Antonescu himself. Officials say that the content of the Vienna conference cannot be disclosed. (19th United Press dispatch)

Berlin Reliable sources here reported last night that Chancellor Hitler is planning to hold another important meeting next week, possibly in Vienna. The issues to be discussed at this new meeting may include (1) the friction between Hungary and Romania, especially regarding the minority issues caused by the German-Italian arbitration in the Balkan conference held in Vienna earlier this year; (2) the friction between Hungary and Yugoslavia; (3) general issues regarding the Danube River. Informed sources here refused to comment on whether Albania will participate in the second Vienna conference, but it is widely believed that it will include Germany, Italy, Hungary, Romania, and Yugoslavia, and that the Soviet Union may attend as an observer.

Axis Powers' Diplomatic Activities, Organizing a Large Anti-British Group

Rome Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's organ, "Il Telegrafo," published an article by Michel Douy yesterday, stating that the Axis powers are trying to build a solid "Eurasian Group." The sphere of influence of this group will extend from Algeciras in Spain to Tokyo in Japan. Michel said, "The Anglo-American group has been established. From now on, the United Kingdom can obtain troops and military supplies from the United States. President Roosevelt has mobilized the United States' war industry in order to greatly assist the United Kingdom in June 1941. However, Mussolini and Hitler are also expediting the expansion of their Axis group, from Algeciras to Tokyo. Several countries within this land area will cooperate militarily with the Axis powers to resist the United Kingdom. This vast 'Eurasian Group' will soon be established. Although not all members of this group will necessarily participate in military actions, they will all be closely linked with the Axis powers. In other words, within the range from Algeciras to Tokyo, all organized and important countries will join this system. This system can be called the 'International Cooperation System,' and its purpose is to eliminate the British Empire. The United Kingdom, which opposes this system, can now only obtain assistance from the United States." (19th United Press dispatch)

Berlin The two official announcements released here last night regarding the talks between Hitler and the foreign ministers of Italy and Spain did not mention the content of the talks, only stating that Hitler's individual talks with the two foreign ministers lasted a long time, and that a joint meeting was held afterwards. The comments in the Berlin newspapers also expressed extreme reservations. Goebbels' mouthpiece, the "Essener National-Zeitung," stated that what was discussed was "the organization of an anti-British alliance, a ring of encirclement around the United Kingdom, which began with the Brenner Pass meeting, and that progress in all aspects is still continuing. This encirclement will be a masterpiece of political art." This informed German newspaper continued, "A new week of action has begun, and the results of the efforts of Germany and Italy will soon mature." (19th Haitian News Agency dispatch)

Axis Powers Mediate, Reconciling Soviet-Spanish Relations

Rome Observers believe that the purpose of the Berchtesgaden conference is to reconcile the Soviet Union and Spain, so that the two countries' dictators, Stalin and Franco, can develop friendship with each other. Currently, the lack of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Spain is causing many obstacles to the Axis powers' new plan. It is said that the Soviet Foreign Minister agreed in Berlin that if Franco could recognize the Soviet government, the Soviet Union would also recognize it and exchange ambassadors with Spain. Both German and Italian Foreign Ministers seem to be strongly urging Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer to abandon his past grudges from the Soviet Union's participation in the Spanish Civil War. (19th United Press dispatch)

Istanbul The official Ankara Radio recently stated that the tension in Berlin's diplomatic activities is sufficient to show that Germany is facing a difficult situation. The radio stated that Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer went to Berlin after Hitler's talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, perhaps because Germany must have explained the talks to Spain and guaranteed that the anti-Comintern pact would be implemented again after the war. (19th United Press dispatch)

Italian-Spanish Territorial Ambitions, North African Situation Worth Watching

London London officials expect that there may be major developments in North Africa after this meeting between Germany, Italy, and Spain. The territorial ambitions of Spain and Italy in North Africa may even lead to conflict with General Weygand, the Vichy government's commander in Africa, because Weygand opposes ceding any Moroccan territory to the Axis powers or Spain. The British Manchester Guardian reported yesterday that if Vichy Foreign Minister Laval concludes any conditions with the Axis, Weygand may take independent anti-government action. Although Weygand is not allied with De Gaulle, it is quite possible. (19th United Press dispatch)

Madrid Spanish government councillor Arrese delivered a speech to the trade union conference yesterday, stating that Spain must adapt to the new economic order in Europe. German Chancellor Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini often subordinate commerce to politics, making it a tool fully managed by politicians. In contrast, British commerce has always taken a liberal approach, so the United Kingdom has failed to fully utilize its national economic interests. The trade union movement in Italy is a reaction to the liberal theory of the French Revolution. The unfair treaties of 1919 deprived Germany and Italy of raw material resources, which led Germany and Italy to develop into self-sufficient economies. This has become a new trend in economics, so Spain should adapt to the new economic order. (19th Haitian News Agency dispatch)

### German Troops Concentrated on Bulgarian Border, Awaiting Orders, Possible Invasion of Greece Via Bulgaria, Bulgarian King Meets Hitler and Returns Home

New York The New York Times' Battle Creek dispatch stated that diplomatic circles in the Swiss capital asserted that the five fully equipped German divisions currently in Bulgaria could invade Greece within forty-eight hours. Yugoslavia will be forced to participate in the new Balkan order, and it is believed that the Bulgarian King, during his meeting with Hitler, indicated that he would allow German troops to invade Greece. According to a qualified observer who arrived in Istanbul from Sofia, informed sources believe that the time is approaching for Bulgaria to undergo a bloodless coup, causing it to fall into the hands of the Axis powers. (19th Reuters dispatch)

Rome According to the Italian official news agency, King Boris of Bulgaria met with Hitler in Berchtesgaden on Sunday for a talk. This news was scheduled to be disclosed in Bulgarian newspapers on Sunday. It is reported that the Bulgarian King traveled to Germany in a private capacity and returned to Sofia immediately after the talks. (19th Reuters dispatch)

Sofia This morning, the Bulgarian newspapers prominently published the news of the King's visit to Germany, but all avoided criticizing it, so the Bulgarian people knew nothing about the purpose of the King's visit and the circumstances of his talks with Hitler. According to informed sources, King Boris traveled to Berchtesgaden on Hitler's private plane. Bulgarian Foreign Minister Popov and German Minister to Bulgaria Zechlin also traveled with him. The Bulgarian people were deeply impressed by this event. (19th Haitian News Agency dispatch)

Sofia The news that Bulgaria had ordered a general mobilization, issued by American correspondents to overseas, is completely inaccurate. In fact, the situation is that the southern and southeastern European countries have mobilized a large number of reservists and increased border defenses. The Bulgarian authorities stated that this measure cannot be regarded as an extraordinary measure at present. (19th Haitian News Agency dispatch)

### Bulgarian Newspapers Advocate Claiming Territory from Greece

Sofia The details of the Bulgarian King's consultation with Hitler have not yet been disclosed. Political observers believe that Bulgaria will soon join the German side in the war. The Bulgarian press began today to advocate demanding access to the Aegean Sea through Greece. (19th International dispatch)

Sofia In recent weeks, Bulgarian newspapers have only sporadically mentioned the demand for the return of Thrace, but still expressed reservations. Until yesterday, all Bulgarian newspapers except the semi-official newspaper openly raised the demand for territory. According to informed sources, the candid advocacy of the newspapers was allowed by the government. The "New News" stated that the Bulgarian people, under the leadership of national justice, have been paying close attention to the Aegean coast. The peaceful resolution of the Thrace issue is not a risky matter. (19th Haitian News Agency dispatch)

### Germany to Exert Pressure on Turkey, Forcing it to Accept the New Order, Turkish Ambassador to Germany Returns Home

Ankara Political figures here now believe that the outcome of the meeting between Hitler and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in Berlin will likely put pressure on Turkey again. According to a report in a Berlin newspaper, German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen said to foreign reporters today that since Molotov's visit to Germany, it has become an urgent issue for Turkey to improve relations with the Axis powers and to fully restore friendly relations with the Soviet Union. If Turkey accepts the "new order," Germany and Italy will respect its independence, and the Soviet Union will also abandon any demands on the Balkans. According to Turkish political figures, they firmly believe that Turkey has the ability to overcome any "psychological warfare." (19th Reuters dispatch)

Ankara Turkish Ambassador to Germany Gerede arrived here by train from Istanbul yesterday and immediately drove to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a long talk with Foreign Minister Saracoglu. In the afternoon, he also met with Turkish President İsmet. Informed sources said that German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen will return to his post at the weekend.

### Soviet-German-Italian Intensify Submarine Construction

Moscow The "Izvestia" here published an article on the 10th anniversary of the Soviet submarine force, stating that the Soviet government, in view of the international situation, has legally accelerated the construction of submarines, and is paying attention to the Far East. A strong submarine fleet is stationed on the Pacific side. Soviet shipyards are able to build various types of submarines, and the Soviet Union can also manufacture all kinds of equipment for submarines. (19th Haitian News Agency dispatch)

Rome Mussolini's mouthpiece "Il Popolo d'Italia" stated that Italy and Germany are making every effort to accelerate the construction of submarines, which will strengthen the submarine warfare to encircle the United Kingdom. It is reported that the maritime losses of the United Kingdom and its allies have now reached 10,000 dead, 6 million tons of ships sunk, and 6 million tons of ships damaged. Italy and Germany are now rapidly increasing the number of submarines. The newly built submarines have extremely good technical improvements based on combat experience. Of the above-mentioned maritime losses, British ships account for two-thirds, and the other one-third are ships from Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, and other countries.

### British Prisoners of War Severely Mistreated in Germany, U.K. Requests U.S. Intervene

London Secretary of State for War Eden stated in the House of Commons today in response to a question regarding the treatment of British prisoners of war that he was very dissatisfied with the situation of British prisoners of war in some detention camps in Germany and had urged the German government to fulfill its obligations through available diplomatic channels. A few days ago, the U.K. requested the U.S. government to raise this issue. (19th Reuters dispatch)

### Soviet Union Experiments with Wheat Cultivation, Two Harvests a Year

Moscow The director of the crop seed experiment station in the Stalingrad region, Pelev, obtained two wheat harvests on a cultivated land last year, averaging five tons of wheat per hectare. His method was to plant spring seeds immediately after the first harvest. Although the frost and snow were heavy at the time, there was still a harvest. Pelev's planting method is now being tested by other farms. (18th TASS dispatch)

The report stated that Italian troops are gradually retreating, and hand-to-hand combat reportedly occurred. (Associated Press, 19th)

Budapest: According to a Greek radio broadcast received here yesterday, fierce fighting would take place around Korçë on Monday. The intensity of the fighting was not diminished by Italian attempts to stop the Greek advance. Despite being strafed by machine guns from the air, Greek troops continued to attack, and the charging Greek forces captured many Italian positions, taking numerous Italian prisoners and spoils of war. In this battle, seven Italian bombers and two fighter planes were reportedly shot down, while two Greek planes were lost. The radio broadcast continued, stating that Greek forces had fiercely attacked and occupied several Italian positions in the Kalamas area. Greek forces drove the Italian troops out of their mountain positions, inflicting heavy losses on them. Italian positions near other highlands in the mountains were also occupied by Greek forces. As a result, Italian forces in the Florina-Mount Ivan area have been completely cleared. The large number of Italian troops and aircraft did not help in the mountain battle. It is reported that Italian forces in the Florina area attempted to reach the Thessaloniki highway, but this attempt by the Italian troops was defeated at the outset by a Greek counter-offensive. The radio broadcast further stated that, in summarizing the three weeks of fighting, Italian forces not only failed to enter Athens on November 4 as they had expected, but have also been forced to adopt a defensive posture on their Albanian front. At present, the Greek people are celebrating the arrival of another group of British airmen in Athens. (Associated Press, 19th)

Athens: Greek forces on various fronts made further progress yesterday. It is reported that they destroyed a motorized division that was attempting to escape into Yugoslavia. Yesterday morning, Greek forces prepared to attack, and in the afternoon, they advanced northeast of Korçë. Italian forces in the Korçë area attempted to counter-attack with the help of aircraft, but it is reported that nine of their aircraft were shot down. Greek forces advanced to a valley near Korçë, capturing 10,000 blankets, a large amount of food, ten artillery pieces, thirty-three anti-tank guns, and fifteen mortars. Greek forces have begun mopping-up operations in the Korçë area. Several Italian armored vehicles, in order to avoid being captured by Greek forces, crossed into Yugoslavia near Kali-Leri. It is reported that they were detained by the Yugoslavian authorities. This is likely a part of the Italian division destroyed by Greek artillery and aircraft. It is reported that the division had 130 tanks. Now that Italian forces have abandoned their base of Korçë, the city is half engulfed in flames and under fire. The Greek side recently claimed to have captured twelve Italian field guns, four heavy guns, light field guns, mortars, and other materials in the central area, as well as over seven hundred Italian officers and soldiers. It is reported that Greek forces on various fronts are maintaining their offensive, breaking through the Italian resistance on three fronts. According to reports from Yugoslavia, Greek forces attacked Italian positions south of the Kalamas River yesterday morning, capturing one hundred Italian soldiers, including four officers. News from the Yugoslav border reports that Greek artillery, having advanced on Saturday, is currently bombarding the roads of the Italian retreat from Korçë, thus blocking their transport. Greek forces in the Pindus Mountains have now reached the Gramos mountain ridge, crossed the Albanian border, and brought artillery to cut off communications between the Korçë area and the supply center of Meharra.

Mussolini Attempts to Reverse the Decline; Orders Frontline Soldiers to Seize Victory

Rome: It is reported that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini today ordered his troops in Europe and Africa to redouble their efforts to fulfill his vow that Italy would severely punish Greece and that the war would end simultaneously with the destruction of England. It is understood that the leaders of the Italian army are planning a larger offensive against Greece, but the Italian Prime Minister, in a speech commemorating the fifth anniversary of the expedition to Abyssinia for the League of Nations, said that a victory over Greece may take a year. Italian officials today predicted that Italian forces in East Africa would intensify their offensive and that the number of Italian troops fighting against the British would also increase. A communiqué issued here today minimized the losses of Italian forces in Greece, acknowledging little beyond Korçë. It stated, "On the Greek front, our forces have only engaged in minor activities." According to well-informed sources here, the author of the lengthy Italian communiqué is none other than the Italian Prime Minister himself. The Italian High Command today stated that a detachment of Italian cavalry was completely annihilated in the Korçë area. It further stated that Italian aircraft heavily bombed Greek cities last night and that Italian aircraft bombed British ships and launched torpedoes in the port of Alexandria, with considerable success. (International News, 19th)

Greek Artillery Controls Korçë: Italian Troops Retreat to the Southern Border and are Disarmed

Athens: Frontline reports state that Greek forces occupied the bridge controlling Korçë yesterday and began bombarding the burning city with heavy artillery, paving the way for a swift advance. According to Greek frontline news, after the annihilation of an Italian armored division, Italian troops retreated to a new defensive line in Albania, more than twenty miles from the border. However, Greek forces do not expect the Italian troops to stay long on the new defensive line. The Greek High Command believes that the Italian troops will launch a counter-attack, as Korçë, although scorched earth, is a strategically important place that the Italian troops must fight for. The Athens newspaper "Proia" reported that Greek troops patrolled the Strait of Otranto on Thursday and Friday and saw no Italian ships. It is reported that the Greek invasion of Albania was aided by the supporting actions of British and Greek aircraft. British and Greek aircraft forced the Italian troops to abandon their positions in Greek territory. It is claimed that Greek forces are still clearing out the remaining Italian troops in the Korçë area. (International News, 19th)

### The Power of Great Britain is Not What it Once Was: Hitler Misses an Opportunity; Henderson Delivers a Speech

London: Former British Ambassador to Germany Henderson stated yesterday in a speech in Ipswich, England, that he believed that no one regretted the Munich Agreement more than Hitler. Hitler knew that he had missed an opportunity. Those who generally criticize former British Prime Minister Chamberlain also know that on September 28, 1938, Great Britain did not have a single Spitfire fighter. At least four hundred new-style anti-aircraft guns were needed to protect London, but only seven new-style anti-aircraft guns and one or two experimental Hurricane fighters were available to defend London that year. Germany was able to drop 2,000 tons of bombs on London every day at that time, but the British had no way to respond. German Air Force Chief Goering once said to me that if Britain insisted on going to war, London would soon be utterly destroyed and Czechoslovakia would be absolutely nothing. (Reuters, 19th)

### The Painful History of the European War (3) Three Protagonists in the French Tragedy

(2) Gamalin: Able to See, Unable to Act

On Monday, I wrote a letter, presented through Bonnet, to Daladier. The letter reiterated the conversation of the previous day, saying, "We did not pay attention to that man's remarks in the past. If we fail to heed his warnings this time, we will bear a grave responsibility."

I waited and waited. Later, I heard that Daladier was still considering it. In short, he couldn't make a decision without the consent of the General Staff!

England and France declared war on Germany, and the authorities were busy deploying troops. Everything was shelved. Everything was always too late.

One day, I met Bonnet, who had been transferred from Minister of Foreign Affairs to Minister of Justice, his former post being taken over by Daladier himself. I asked him, "What about the matter of asking Mussolini to clarify his attitude?"

He said, "Gamelin opposes it. He needs two weeks to complete the mobilization plan. He believes that even if Italy attacks in two weeks, it would be better than attacking now."

I then went to see the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, Coulondre. He confirmed that Gamelin wanted to complete his "peaceful mobilization." He seemed very pleased that Germany had not bothered him since September 3rd.

On the morning of December 16, 1939, the telephone suddenly rang.

A very polite voice said, "I am Captain Hao Wan, an aide to General Gamelin. General Gamelin hopes you will come for a talk today, anytime after 5:30 PM."

"Anytime after 5:30 PM, the Commander-in-Chief can send a car to pick you up."

Even with matters to discuss with ministers, even the closest friends wouldn't be so accommodating. Now, the Commander-in-Chief was saying "at your convenience," which made me feel incredibly honored. So I said, "I think it's better to suit the Commander-in-Chief's convenience."

"No, no, sir, please set the time yourself."

I had to pick a time at random, saying, "Very well, how about 5:45?"

"Good. The car will be waiting at your door at 5:15."

It turned out that I had expressed my willingness to visit the front lines to Gamelin a few days earlier. I wanted to see the situation of this war that was only a war in name, and the attitude of the French army. I had also said that if he had time, I would like to pay him a visit before leaving to make a final decision. If he was too busy with military affairs to receive me, he could simply dismiss the idea.

At 5:15, the car from the General Headquarters arrived. I drove out of Paris in the dimness of the blackout.

I thought I was going to Vincennes, where the General Headquarters was located. Although I was very familiar with the roads in Paris and its suburbs, I soon lost my bearings. The car went left and right, winding and turning for a long time. If it were Vincennes, we should have arrived long ago. Could it be that we were going somewhere else, or was the driver under orders to create confusion and leave me bewildered?

Suddenly, the car stopped on a road lined with tall trees, the wheels crunching on gravel. The soldier driving the car opened the door. After I got out, I saw a gloomy house. The sky was dark, and only a faint light shone at the doorway. A guard led me into a room, dimly lit and simply furnished, with only a table and a few chairs. The table was piled with military magazines, giving it a distinctly military atmosphere. There was no one inside, it was very quiet, and I saw no one coming or going. It was Saturday evening, and it was extremely strange that the General Headquarters was so deserted. Even the reception room of a minister who wasn't very important would be much livelier.

Suddenly, a young officer entered the room and asked, "Are you Mr. Chauroux-Romain?"

"I am."

"Sir, I will inform the General."

He turned around shortly afterward, and as I followed him, I thought that I must not disturb the Commander-in-Chief for more than ten minutes because of his politeness.

The officer opened a door and entered a large rectangular room, brightly lit. Gamelin came forward to greet me, with a smile on his face that did not seem forced. He was wearing a simple military uniform and khaki leggings.

Gamelin was the only person in the room. After asking me to sit down, he sat opposite me with his legs crossed, only a few steps away.

This conversation was one of the most extraordinary in my life. I was very moved at the time. Later, between May and June 1940, as the situation deteriorated, I often recalled it and gradually realized the great historical significance of this conversation. The mystique of the man who influenced the fate of every person in France, and even every person in Europe, was fully revealed in this conversation.

He asked me, "Have you just returned from Switzerland?"

He was very calm, with a slight smile. He asked me what I thought of Switzerland, what the people's intentions were, what the political news was, inquiring about everything in detail. He seemed to have obtained detailed information and spoke in a very leisurely and pleasant manner.

I told him that I would be going to Belgium again in two weeks. His conversation immediately turned to my first trip to Belgium in mid-October. He said, "I know you did a good thing," and mentioned a question I had raised with the Belgian government.

He said, "If any French mechanized unit were to cross the border from France into Belgium, it would stretch for over sixty miles, and the few roads connecting Belgium and France would be easy targets for bombing!"

We then talked about the rumors I had heard in Switzerland in December 1939 about the German army surrendering.

He commented, "I personally do not believe that Germany will collapse automatically without suffering defeat. I don't believe that blockades and starvation have any direct effect. The German people will not revolt because of this. I admit that this strategy has only indirect consequences; prolonged malnutrition may cause physical weakness and reduce mental resistance, and a military setback would easily destabilize the whole country."

We talked about everything concerning the international situation. Gamelin spoke cautiously, considering every word. He seemed to know everything. I was very familiar with the countries we discussed, and I was constantly receiving information. I was impressed by the accuracy of his judgments.

When talking about Italy, Gamelin said, "If I were to attack Italy, I would do it differently."

But he never explained why he had no intention of "attacking Italy" or showing any threat to Italy. The so-called "doing it differently" was only referring to a different strategy than the one on the Western Front.

We then discussed the retreat of the French army on the Western Front in early October. I said without hesitation that the French army had made little progress at the beginning, but there were widespread rumors that they had occupied Saarbrücken, which made a bad impression when they later retreated. Gamelin said that he felt the same way, but he believed that the rumors were false and not his fault. Regarding the first offensive, he also said, "At that time, I tied down forty-five German divisions, which was helpful to Poland."

I asked him for his opinion on the Polish war. He smiled and replied, "A few months ago, General Smigly-Rydz, the Chief of the General Staff of the Polish Army, came to France. I advised him to build a continuous line of fortifications in western Poland. He thought that Poland had mobile troops to deal with it." At this point, Gamelin smiled and then said, "I suppose he thought I didn't have any mobile troops!"

We also talked about the Finnish war.

He said, "You see, the Mannerheim Line in Finland has put the Soviet army in a difficult position. Although the Red Army is not comparable to the German army, how can the Mannerheim Line be compared to our Maginot Line!"

Our conversation turned from the Mannerheim Line to the Maginot Line. He praised the Maginot Line for protecting mobilization and allowing the army to be deployed at ease. He believed that the German army had not attacked on the Western Front because of the Maginot Line. Even if the German army launched a flanking attack through the Netherlands and Belgium, it would require large-scale preparations, and how could they take care of this while they were busy dealing with Poland?

He added, "This gives us an opportunity to prepare, and we should be overjoyed. I have strengthened the fortifications of the Maginot Line, and its resistance is now twice as strong as before. I have also extended the line north along the Belgian border."

"Are there any field fortresses or strong fortifications?"

"We have built very careful bunkers. We now know how to quickly build modern reinforced concrete bunkers. If you are interested in visiting, you are welcome. You may not be able to see everything, but you can get a general idea."

He raised his head slightly and thought for a moment, then said, "This war is different from many previous ones. First, unlike 1914, there are no small contacts every day, such as attacking trenches and seizing fortresses, shelling each other, and sacrificing lives. Both sides have abandoned these meaningless acts. The complete innovation in the nature of war is thought-provoking. But very few people really understand this 'layer', and most people regard this stalemate warfare as trivial. In fact, you must know that it is a big mistake to say that the previous war will be repeated." He smiled again and said, "This war is completely different from the last one." After saying this, he pondered for a moment.

"In fact, the war of 1914 was an exception. No one understands this. Just look through history, for example, in the 18th century, the two armies often fought for years without making any progress, falling into a stalemate. Besieging towns took even longer. From the cold winter to the warm spring, waiting for an opportunity to arrive, the two sides could fight a decisive battle and determine the outcome."

His eyes were bright as he stared at the ceiling, calm and composed, like a great thinker in control of everything. I couldn't help but think of my neighbor Bergson. He was a famous philosopher, and when I visited him, he often lowered his head in deep thought, without saying a word. Gamelin was also one of these people.

Gamelin was lost in thought, seemingly enjoying himself, so I had to pretend to listen attentively. Moreover, I had received an indication from Gamelin that the generals had read my book "Verdun" and believed that the author was not completely ignorant of military affairs. At that time, I asked him what he predicted for the future development of the war.

His eyes still fixed on the ceiling, he replied, "If you want to understand what is happening now and in the future, you must first know that the nature of the armies has changed. The army has become a very valuable tool, very powerful and effective, but it consumes a lot of resources. It takes a lot of money to train or maintain an army. The amount of military supplies and fuel consumed in a day of war is something that outsiders cannot know. Our army can be compared to the fleet in the previous war. The fleet at that time was indeed of great value, with a complex structure and great effectiveness, but it would not be easily sacrificed until the last minute when it was a matter of life and death."

I was fascinated by what I heard. I had never heard such a novel and insightful view on this war before.

He lowered his voice, almost whispering to me, "Don't you want to know how I predict the future? I think at first there will be a long period of inactivity, and then a sudden outbreak of war, with all material and human resources being gambled on a single throw. The decision of victory or defeat will be much faster than the public imagines." He first bowed his head and frowned, then spoke in a deep voice, his eyes staring straight ahead, "Yes, this battle will be incredibly fast and terrifying. The public cannot imagine how terrible it will be!" (To be continued)

### Thunderstorms in the Strait, London Silent Overnight, German Planes Brave Bad Weather to Attack England, Liverpool Suffers Heaviest Damage from Bombing

Berlin. Although the weather was bad yesterday, German planes continued to bomb military targets in Southampton, Birmingham, Coventry, and Liverpool. (Hai Tong Electric Dispatch, 19th)

London. Last night and this morning, German planes attacked many places in the United Kingdom, and the northern border of Ireland was also attacked, but few bombs were dropped. Although there were several air raid alerts in London overnight, nothing happened. Liverpool was apparently the worst hit last night, as enemy planes dropped many high-explosive and incendiary bombs on the city. Many residents were killed and injured, and rescuers were still working this morning, pulling bodies from the rubble. A few bombs also fell in a certain city in Merseyside, the Midlands, and parts of southern England, and there were some fires, but they were quickly extinguished. The casualties and damage in each area were said to be minor. It was also reported that a German plane was shot down in the Midlands. London's respite and relief were due to heavy clouds and incessant thunderstorms. Except for the recent Sunday when the alert was lifted at 6:30 PM, after 24 hours without an alert, the air raids on London last night and yesterday were probably the lightest in weeks. Last night, a German plane was spotted in the sky near midnight, and the alert was raised, and anti-aircraft guns fired at the plane. After the reconnaissance plane left, London returned to a state of "false air raid." Another false raid occurred shortly after midnight, but no planes were heard in the entire London area. Although anti-aircraft guns were heard firing outside London, no bombs fell. Although the German planes last night were operating elsewhere in England, such as Liverpool and southwest England, nine German planes raided the northeast coast of England for three hours last night, but retreated without dropping any bombs due to heavy anti-aircraft fire. It was also reported that German planes attacked a certain town in northeast England at 8:40 PM last night. (United Press Electric Dispatch, 19th)

London. The mysterious flashes of light last night caused the British to experience a false alarm of invasion. Later, after meteorological experts explained that they were sudden electric flashes in the sky over the Strait, people's hearts were settled. However, the British long-range artillery, aircraft, and ground troops in the Dover area were all put on high alert. (International Electric Dispatch, 19th)

### British Planes Attack German Oil Refineries, Dropping Nearly a Thousand Incendiary Bombs

London. On Monday evening, the British Air Force concentrated its forces again to attack a city in Germany. This city was Gelsenkirchen, and the bombing began particularly early. The main target was the Purfina synthetic oil plant in the Bulmke district near the city, which is the most important manufacturing plant for synthetic aviation fuel in Germany, with an expected annual output of 300,000 tons. The first wave of British planes circled for over an hour, dropping many high-explosive bombs and nearly a thousand incendiary bombs. The pilots saw the fire spread to an area of half a square mile in an instant. During the second wave of attacks, two other oil refineries were bombed, resulting in multiple fires. (Reuters Electric Dispatch, 19th)

London. According to sources in key positions, the British Air Force bombed and repeatedly attacked oil plants in central Germany last night. (Reuters Electric Dispatch, 19th)

### American Countries Agree to Military Cooperation to Jointly Defend the Western Hemisphere

Washington. Undersecretary of State Welles stated yesterday at a press briefing that the twenty republics of the Americas have agreed to cooperate jointly to defend the Western Hemisphere. He said that regarding the defense of the Western Hemisphere, the United States has consulted with the twenty republics, and the countries have agreed to cooperate jointly on a very broad range, based on the Havana, Panama, and previous Pan-American conference agreements. It is understood that Welles' statement clarifying the twenty republics was intended to refute the recent widespread rumors that Argentina and Chile would not cooperate with the United States to defend the Western Hemisphere. (United Press Electric Dispatch, 19th)

### Britain Plans to Make Another Request to the United States for Ship Transfers, Hoping to Obtain Another Fifty Old Destroyers

Washington. Today, the International News Service learned from the most well-informed sources here that Britain plans to request the United States again soon to transfer fifty over-age destroyers to Britain. It is reported that after British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, returns from London, he will urge Secretary of State Hull or President Roosevelt to issue a new destroyer transfer certificate. Fifty over-age American destroyers have already been handed over to Britain in exchange for leases of British-owned islands in the Western Hemisphere as bases. It is generally expected that the well-known American "country editor" and chairman of the Aid England Committee, White, will soon declare, when preparing to explain the reasons for the transfer, that if food, fuel, and munitions are to be supplied to England for the winter, then helping the British navy is a necessary measure. Military experts here believe that although the United States' neutrality patrol has been expanded and can relieve Britain of its Western Atlantic blockade task, recent British convoys across the Atlantic have not been adequately defended. It is understood that British warships have now transferred the responsibility of monitoring the French warships at Martinique Island and the German cargo ships in the ports of the Caribbean Sea and Mexico to the American neutrality patrol, and have transferred themselves to the English Channel and the Mediterranean Sea. In this regard, the navy believes that the incident on Saturday in which the German cargo ship "Halicia" was scuttled off Tampico, Mexico, and three others escaped back to port, may have been caused by an American destroyer issuing a "warning signal" to a British ship. Naval officials here said that the reason why the destroyer "warned" the British ship cannot be announced. Although individual defense strategists acknowledge and express great sympathy for Britain's needs, they point out that the administration opposes the re-transfer of destroyers, as this move will disrupt the balance of the American fleet. According to official statistics, there are 159 destroyers in active service, of which 75 are already over-age. President Roosevelt explained that the recent transfer of 50 American destroyers to Britain in exchange for the lease of British bases in the Western Hemisphere was a way to keep Americans out of the war. Some quarters have commented on this, but the press has enthusiastically supported the matter. They said that Britain is America's last loyal friend in Europe, and Britain's powerful navy is America's best insurance. It is generally believed that this trade is part of a three-part program to enhance American defense, the other two parts being the signing of the Havana Agreement, cooperation with South America, and the establishment of the American-Canadian Joint Defense Committee. (International Electric Dispatch, 19th)

New York. The New York Tribune quoted a London dispatch as saying that what Britain urgently needs is for the United States to provide another 100 destroyers for its use. Britain also hopes that the United States will put pressure on Ireland so that Britain can obtain military bases on the Irish coast, and further hopes to use American warships to escort British convoys in the Atlantic. It also stated that British Ambassador to the United States Lothian plans to return from England to his post within a few days to negotiate with the US government. If Roosevelt refuses to grant Britain assistance, the British government may seize naval bases in Ireland by force. (Hai Tong News Agency Electric Dispatch, 19th)

### US Bases in the West Indies, Locations Agreed Upon

London. London officials announced that the British and American governments have now agreed on the locations of the bases in the West Indies leased to the United States, and that administrative and jurisdictional issues will be resolved by bilateral conferences. The British government has now proposed holding a conference in London. For most of the bases, with the exception of Trinidad, preliminary work will begin in the near future, as the US Survey Commission's visits to various colonies and discussions with local governors have enabled everything to proceed quickly. When the colonial governors were conducting discussions, they sought the opinions of the West Indies Garrison Commander or his staff. The Commission also went to Trinidad to survey the island's position and is still under investigation. (Reuters Electric Dispatch, 19th)

Vigo. According to news received here, the hurricane on the northern coast of Spain has intensified in the past 24 hours, and several ships have entered Vigo for refuge. Telegraph and telephone communications between Vigo and Portugal and Madrid have been cut off, and several houses in Mérida have collapsed. (Hai Tong Electric Dispatch, 19th)

Milan. Heavy rains in northern Italy in recent days have caused the Isonzo River to swell, overflowing its banks. A nearby small bridge was washed away, and the plains of Gorizia suffered heavy losses. Many warehouses and wine cellars in the area were flooded, and more than twenty houses were flooded in Valar. Near Alessandria, a bridge was washed away. Bologna and Sassari also suffered heavy losses. Italian soldiers are engaged in rescue work and evacuating residents from the disaster area.

### Method of Reeling Silk Directly from Silkworms

Tokyo. According to the Japan Chronicle, Professor Nakajima of Miyazaki Higher School of Agriculture and Forestry has invented a method of reeling silk directly from silkworms. The quality of the silk is more lustrous than orchid silk, and its durability is similar to that of cocoon silk. Professor Nakajima has raised more than 60 kinds of silkworms for ten years, carefully studying the silk-spinning organs of each silkworm, and has only now achieved results with his experiments.

Educational News

### Commissioner of the Ministry of Education Makes a Statement on the Educational Situation in Shanghai; Public Opinion Circles Review Oversight and Express Gratitude

(Dahua News Agency) Recently, Shanghai newspapers have frequently discussed the current state of the education sector, offering either proactive suggestions or critical commentary, and some even pleading on behalf of faculty and students. Yesterday, a reporter from Dahua News Agency met with a commissioner from the Ministry of Education stationed in Shanghai and inquired about his views on general public opinion. The commissioner made a solemn statement, expressing his earnest hope that public opinion circles and educational administration could cooperate closely. At a time when administrative power cannot be fully utilized, public opinion sanctions are the greatest force for rectifying discipline and advancing undertakings. He also expressed his deep respect and gratitude for the past efforts of public opinion circles. The transcript of his statement is as follows:

Public Opinion Spurs Vigorous Effort

Education is the foundation of a nation. Its strengths and weaknesses are sufficient to influence the nation and its people. Since the retreat of the Chinese army and Shanghai's isolation, administrative power has not been fully utilized, leading to complex and chaotic phenomena, and even the occurrence of some corrupt incidents. Newspapers are the voice of the people, and public opinion represents the will of the people. It is their responsibility to discuss and criticize the merits and demerits of educational facilities, and it is also a significant contribution. Therefore, whether it is proactive suggestions or critical commentary, the educational administration is paying close attention and devising strategies for rectification and advancement. Shanghai newspapers have always attached great importance to education, and all editors have been loyal and diligent in fully exercising the functions of public opinion. The spirit of hard work and struggle over the past three years is truly admirable. In fact, due to the supervision of public opinion, educational administration or school facilities have gained inspiration and improved in countless ways. I am deeply encouraged by this supervision and spurring of public opinion and should express my infinite respect and gratitude to the reporters who are struggling and fighting hard.

Expose Facts and Impose Sanctions

Generally speaking, the current state of the Shanghai education sector is a rare miracle in the history of arduous struggle, loyalty, and perseverance. This is a great glory for the Shanghai education community in the history of resistance and nation-building. However, there are a few bad elements who prioritize personal gain and engage in acts that violate laws and regulations, which tarnishes the reputation of educational personnel and is truly distressing. It is hoped that colleagues in the education and press circles will expose and report such actions at any time and jointly impose sanctions through public opinion. As for administrative relations, officials will be dispatched to thoroughly investigate to clarify the truth and report to the Ministry of Education for punishment.

Mutual Assistance and Planning to Rectify School Affairs

In general schools, if there are situations of corruption and neglect, faculty and students can uphold justice and report the facts of misconduct and dissatisfaction to the principal or acting responsible person, requesting improvement, and use the collective power of all to supervise its implementation. In short, strive to achieve the goal of improvement before stopping.

Promote Free Education and Subsidize Living

At present, the cost of living has increased significantly, causing teachers' lives to fall into extreme hardship. This must be addressed with relief measures. However, it is necessary to first formulate sound standards and methods that can be realistically implemented so that teachers living below the minimum living cost can receive subsidies. This point will be strongly requested from the Ministry. In addition, this city has public and private facilities for compulsory education, which is a good way to help poor teachers and out-of-school children. In addition to requesting the Ministry to increase funding for free education, it is hoped that social organizations or private individuals can raise funds to establish more free schools, which will greatly benefit both faculty and students. Private schools with ample financial resources should consider the difficulties of their teachers and find ways to help them or provide various conveniences for running free education.

Sincere Acceptance of Guidance from Public Opinion

Regarding the improvement of education and the eradication of corruption, we fully and sincerely accept the guidance of public opinion and engage in investigation and rectification work so that the power of public opinion and administrative functions can be fully coordinated and utilized to achieve the effects of supervision, promotion, and sanction. If this can be done, the future of Shanghai education will certainly have greater achievements. This can be asserted with certainty.

### Chen Shizhen Temporarily Assumes the Position of President of Northwest University

(Xi'an, 19th) Hu Shuhua, President of National Northwest University, was ordered by the Ministry of Education to swap positions with Pi Zongshi, President of National Hunan University.

The Ministry of Education has now specially appointed Councilor Chen Shizhen to temporarily act as president. It is reported that Councilor Chen has left Chongqing for Shaanxi.

### Inauguration of the Four-Pronged Youth Education Week Today; Jiang Changchuan Delivers a Speech Entitled "My Childhood"

### Shanghai Scouts Mourn Baden-Powell After His Death; Foreign Scouts Scheduled to Hold a Memorial Service at the Cathedral on the Morning of the 24th

Following the death of Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of the Boy Scouts, in Nyeri, Kenya, East Africa, more than 3.5 million Boy Scouts around the world expressed their grief. All Boy Scout troops in Shanghai also flew flags at half-mast to express their condolences. Foreign Boy Scouts are scheduled to hold a grand memorial service next Sunday (the 24th) at 10:00 AM at the Cathedral at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Jiujiang Road. At that time, Boy Scouts from more than ten countries, including England, America, France, and Russia, will attend and report on Baden-Powell's life and the motivation and achievements of founding the Boy Scouts to show their condolences.

### The China Children's Relief Association Begins to Collect Winter Clothing for Needy Children; The Goal is 10,000 Sets of New and Used Cotton-Padded Clothing

The Shanghai office of the China Children's Relief Association has recently stated that as the weather turns cold, many poor children still lack winter clothing. With winter fast approaching, there is a risk of children suffering from the cold. Therefore, a campaign has been launched to collect winter clothing for needy children throughout the city. It is reported that the association will begin collecting donations today, with the goal of 10,000 sets of new and used cotton-padded clothing. The cost of a new set of winter clothing is six yuan. It is believed that people from all walks of life and school authorities will actively support the campaign so that it can achieve satisfactory results as soon as possible.

### Message from the Student Self-Government Association of Qingxin Girls' Middle School

The Student Self-Government Association of Qingxin Girls' Middle School has issued a statement regarding the donation of gifts to celebrate the school's 80th anniversary. It stated that the school's 80th anniversary this year is a rare and grand event that must be marked in some way to commemorate it. Therefore, the school board, alumni, and the Student Self-Government Association jointly initiated the celebration of the 80th anniversary, which was held from November 11th to 16th, including thanksgiving worship, achievement exhibitions, and achievement performances, as well as a play called "Working Women," which was a great success. The students believe that the school's grand celebration is like a family celebrating a birthday. Therefore, they collectively donated gifts, firstly to express their gratitude to the school for its education, and secondly to supplement the insufficient expenses of the celebration. This is also in line with human etiquette and customs and should not be criticized by the refined. Moreover, because the circumstances of the students are different, those who did not want to give gifts were not forced to do so. This is the general situation of the 80th anniversary celebration of the school.

### Western Union Football Team Standings; Donghua Dominates Group A with Six Wins in Six Games; Youyou Leads Group B; A Three-Way Tie in Group C

### Food - Rice Merchants' Efforts Fully Seen

Yesterday, the foreign rice market was filled with rumors of peace talks, causing people's hearts to waver. Some speculators sought to sell off their holdings, resulting in a market flooded with goods and only selling, no buying. Prices plummeted across the board. For example, the Bank Shack's Second Grade Red Pagoda fell to around 68 yuan, more than 1.5 yuan lower than the previous market. It was not until near noon that rumors spread that the peace talks were not accurate, and people's hearts recovered. A large number of short sellers began to cover their positions, and the bulls also took advantage of the cheap prices to search aggressively. The market atmosphere suddenly surged, and prices rebounded sharply. As a result, the closing price was only slightly more than half a yuan to 0.7 or 0.8 yuan higher. Futures prices remained strong, mainly because new transactions could not be continuously finalized. Moreover, due to the changes in the South Seas issue in recent days, monopolists borrowed the conflict between Siam, Japan, and the United States to manipulate the market. This attracted both inside and outside the industry to blindly follow the speculators and scattered hoarders. Therefore, the futures market saw active trading, and the market trend did not decline as much as the spot rice. The small delivery volume for December was still hovering between 77 yuan and 76.57 yuan. The No. 1 Saigon rice for November was 83 yuan, December 81 yuan, the No. 2 for December 78.2 yuan to 77.5 yuan, November 80 yuan to 78.7 or 8 yuan. Prices occasionally declined by a few cents, but people's hearts remained stable. Total daily transactions were still around 10 tons, while spot foreign rice was only 4,000 to 5,000 bags.

Foreign rice also arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carried by the Taikoo Company's Hanyang ship, loaded with 1,348 bags from Hong Kong. It arrived at the port at around 3:00 PM yesterday and docked at the Benhang Wharf in the French Concession to unload. (Zu)

New Jingjian rice and wild paddy rice were also delivered, only 1,300 to 1,400 piculs. However, due to the market atmosphere, the people in the street were generally skeptical, and the view of foreign rice was a plunge. The supply was more than the demand. The market price of the new Jingjian rice and wild paddy rice fell by 1 to 2 yuan. Tea paddy rice plummeted by about 3 yuan. Specifically, the new Jingjian original package was 92 yuan to 88.5 yuan, and the special one was 93.5 yuan. By the bushel, it was 87.2 yuan or 86 yuan. Wild paddy original package was 91 or 92 yuan, and the bushel was 89.5 or 89 yuan. Tea paddy rice was unique in its sales route, with an original package price of 85 yuan and a bushel price of 82.9 yuan. Du Yangjian rice was still in short supply. Glutinous rice arrivals were low, and the market was not abundant. The owners were reluctant to sell easily. Therefore, although sales were normal, the market was still able to stand, with no major ups and downs.

### Flour Market Still Stable

The current flour market is generally stable. The No. 1 flour factory's asking price is still 17 yuan, and the customer's asking price is 18.5 yuan. The number of transactions is not high. In addition to the daily needs of the street, which are supplied by the two factories with 8,000 bags, the customers have recently been paying attention to foreign flour. It is said that more than 30,000 bags of Australian flour have recently arrived, and more than 10,000 bags have been transshipped to Qingdao. Moreover, at present, the foreign flour ordering is affected by the lack of shipping space, and large amounts cannot be shipped. Therefore, people's hearts are still relatively stable. Today, the high-grade foreign flour still requires 19 yuan, and the medium-grade Huashen brand is priced at 18.6 yuan to 18.65 yuan. This street has also received 2,000 bags.

Wheat trading is still difficult to develop. The supply of inland durum wheat is already quiet. Japanese and Chinese factories are unable to collect freely, and the appetite is no longer greedy. It is said that a certain factory had previously ordered 6,000 tons of foreign wheat, which has already been imported, but the factory has not yet confirmed it. The market is still in a state of silence.

### Miscellaneous Grains - Yellow Soybeans Are Still Continuously Shipped to Hong Kong; Oil Beans and Raw Peanuts See Active Trading

The soybean market was originally mediocre. Since the Hong Kong buyers started purchasing on Monday, the market atmosphere has suddenly opened up, and people's hearts have been slightly cheered up. Yesterday, they continued their efforts, and the market price was able to gradually prosper. As a result, high-quality beans were 3 to 4 cents higher than the previous market, and medium-quality beans also rose by 1 to 2 cents. In total, Hong Kong buyers transacted more than 2,000 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan beans, priced from 37 yuan to 37.5 yuan, more than 1,000 bags of Qingdao beans, priced at 35.4 or 35.5 yuan, and 100 bags of Sangyuan beans were taken away by this street, priced at 31.5 yuan. 177 bags of Jiujiang late beans were priced at 25.5 yuan.

Oil beans have seen active trading in and out for days. On the 19th, 1,000 bags of beans arrived from Tianjin, 350 pieces of bean oil from Qingdao, 250 bags of raw peanuts from Yantai, 1,000 cans of raw oil, and another 200 pieces, and 1,500 cans of raw oil from Qingdao. On the 19th, 60 bags of beans were exported to Xiamen, and another 410 bags of beans, 4,240 pieces of bean cake, 590 bags of raw peanuts, 150 pieces of raw oil, another 100 cans, and 650 bags of sesame seeds were all transported to Hong Kong. On the 20th, 350 bags of beans and 1,110 pieces of bean cake were exported to Singapore, and 500 cans of raw oil were transported to Hong Kong.

### Finance - Exchange Market Quiet

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the HSBC listing. The black market for British and American exchange rates saw ordinary changes. Before noon, speculators sold slightly, and the potential trend was slightly looser. Later, speculators slightly bought, and the Chinese banks turned from selling to supplying. The situation was stable. Peace rumors were still strong, but the rumors were unfounded, and few people paid attention. As a result, at the close, the pound sterling had softened, and the US exchange rate was stable.

Speculators Still Selling

In the early morning, the London large-volume exchange rate fell to 625 for the near term and was stable for the long term. The New York silver price remained flat, and the London spot gold price remained stable. The exchange rate of the pound sterling against the US dollar fluctuated slightly, contracting 3.125 against Shanghai. The US dollar against the pound sterling fell 0.25, and there was no change against Shanghai. The central listing exchange rates remained the same. The banks opened with spot prices in the morning: English gold at 3 pounds 750 shillings, and US exchange rate at 5.875 yuan, on par with the evening closing price of the previous day. At the same time, futures trading opened without any changes. After the opening, the market was quietly firm, mainly because trading was deserted and speculators were still sellers, selling off slightly. Chinese banks absorbed US dollars at 5.9375 yuan per dollar. The HSBC listing was unchanged. The silver balance tax was announced to be reduced by 0.25%, and the tax levied was 22.75. In this situation, the speculators still sold, and the American banks were also willing to accept. Both spot and the current month's US dollar were at 5.9375 yuan. However, by noon, the potential trend had softened slightly. The banks' selling price of US dollar futures was changed to 5.90625 yuan. At the close, spot English gold was reported at 3 pounds 76.5625 shillings, which was 0.015625 and 0.03125 shillings higher than the opening in the morning.

US Dollar Flat, Pound Sterling Tightened

The initial situation in the aftermarket was tight. The US dollar for the current month once reached 5.875 yuan. However, not many transactions were made. Later, the Chinese Commercial Bank sold the same month's US dollar for 5.90625 yuan, which was bought up by speculators. By the late close, both spot and futures English gold were reported at 3 pounds 75 shillings. The current month's US dollar was 5.90625 yuan, and the next month's was 5.875 yuan. Compared with the closing price of the US dollar on the previous day, there was no change. Spot and recent English gold contracted by 0.015625.

Hong Kong Pound Sterling and US Dollar Stable

"The joint note on the black market was cheaper by 1.5 yuan, at 84.75 yuan.

### Gold Market Fluctuations, Only 45 Yuan

Yesterday's black market price for cash was unexciting. The ups and downs were getting smaller and smaller, hovering between 5,650 yuan and 700 yuan. People's hearts were calm. Although the peaceful atmosphere had not dissipated, the purchases and sales of the various merchants were uncertain, lacking speculative transactions. The evening closing price was 5,679 yuan, which was 3 yuan lower than the previous day. The total daily transaction was more than 3,500 taels. The gold jewelry price was not changed in the end, and the customs gold and other prices were stable.

### Statement Regarding the Work of Bank Employees

— Jian Ji

In any matter, outsiders speaking about it inevitably miss the point, leading to many misunderstandings. Today, while reading the Shen Bao, I saw Mr. Zhang Mengzhao's article "The Inappropriateness of Saturday Holidays for the Banking Industry," which contained some presumptions regarding the working conditions and treatment of bank employees. Now, I would like to clarify the misunderstandings as follows:

(1) Mr. Zhang said: "Employees in the banking industry receive much better treatment than employees in any industrial or commercial organization." Mr. Zhang certainly did not investigate this thoroughly and merely repeated what others said. As far as the bank I work for and the general banking industry are concerned, the treatment of bank employees is not as generous as outsiders imagine. The treatment of ordinary employees is not even as good as that of employees in large companies. The so-called allowances are added not only in the banking industry but also in other companies due to the high prices. The salaries of bank employees are meager, and the allowances added are very limited. The various unspeakable sufferings can only be understood by those who are bank employees. However, a few who make a fortune from the national crisis are exceptions.

(2) Mr. Zhang said: "Bank employees have leisurely jobs... they live a comfortable life, getting what they want." This is simply uninformed talk. Although the bank's office hours are only seven hours to the public, in reality, it takes another two or three hours after closing. The daily working hours are usually more than ten hours. It is even busier before and after the settlement, requiring overnight work. In addition, the counter is often crowded with customers, and employees have to work non-stop. Even if they have just finished eating, they have to continue writing and calculating at their desks. If there is a mistake, the responsibility is very significant. This kind of heavy and responsible work, with low wages and unhealthy conditions, does not receive sympathy and understanding from society. The general public is so ignorant of the inside workings of the banking industry (the bank employees referred to are, of course, ordinary employees; as for those who rely on their titles and do nothing, that is another matter).

(3) Mr. Zhang insists on attributing the reason for the Saturday afternoon holiday next year to the fact that bank employees can enjoy an extra half-day of pleasure. I really don't know what that is based on. Think about it, the banking industry is a commercial organization, and merchants are the best at calculating. Are they afraid that employees are too tired and show great compassion by giving them more rest and entertainment? As for the Saturday afternoon holiday driving bank employees to decadence, debauchery, and extravagance, those who are willing to degenerate can do so any day. Does it necessarily have to be on a Saturday afternoon? Currently, there are indeed many bank employees who are licentious and shameless, but there are also many who keep themselves clean, endure hardship and resentment, and have personality and integrity.

### Gold Market Morale Declines

In the early morning, morale was low, buyers were watching, and prices seemed to be falling. The opening price for silver exchange was 5,650 yuan for 20 taels from money exchange businesses to silver firms. At that time, silver firms offered to sell, and silver firms traded 20 taels at 5,645 yuan, 5 yuan lower. Later, due to purchases by gold firms and retail investors, the price immediately rebounded. It was calculated that gold firms entered 20 taels into money exchange businesses at 5,680 yuan. Subsequently, due to securities firms and others selling, and buyers stopping, the price was unsustainable. It was calculated that money exchange businesses exited 30 taels to silver firms at 5,650 yuan. Around 11 o'clock, rumors spread that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek rejected peace, and morale uniformly looked optimistic. Money exchange businesses and silver firms then tended to buy, rising to 5,685 yuan. Finally, silver firms exited 20 taels to gold firms at 5,683 yuan, as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the fluctuations were extremely small, and trading was very quiet. At the initial opening, silver firms traded 40 taels at 5,690 yuan. At that time, silver firms urgently sold, so it soon retreated. It was calculated that silver firms exited 20 taels to money exchange businesses at 5,673 yuan. Extended to the closing, the advances and exits were no longer important. It was calculated that silver firms entered 30 taels to other firms at 5,679 yuan, as the closing price, only 3 yuan higher than the previous day. The daily fluctuations were only 45 yuan. The current selling price of cash gold by silver firms is more than 1 yuan higher than cooked gold, and the closing price is 30 yuan lower. The current bidding gold is 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed gold, and few are opening positions.

Ornamental Gold Unchanged All Day

The exchange price of ornamental gold per tael in silver shops remained unchanged all day. It was calculated that Da Tong Hang quoted 580 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang had similar prices. The buying price was about 30 yuan lower.

Annam Currency Sees Some Trading

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw little fluctuation in the red market price. British and American gold pounds were also unusually stable. British gold notes showed a stable trend as before, and the evening market still stood at the original price of 50 yuan. American gold notes hovered within a narrow range, finally falling slightly by 3 points compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes showed a firm trend, rising to 4 yuan in the evening market. Annam currency, which had rarely been traded for a long time, saw some trading yesterday, but the price plummeted. Japanese gold notes have become stable, slightly higher at 1 yuan, 5 jiao, and 2.5 fen in the evening market. Korean notes continued to decline, reaching 1 yuan, 1 jiao, and 5.5 fen in the evening market.

October Clearing House

The following is a summary of the October clearing statistics reported by the Shanghai Clearing House: Clearing amount was 987,910,719.46 yuan, number of cleared checks was 256,253, collection amount was 548,669,022.05 yuan, number of collected checks was 130,047, transfer amount was 2,571,786,198.95 yuan, the daily average amount of clearing deposits and interbank deposits totaled 173,881,903.31 yuan.

"Note: Compared with September, the clearing amount and collection amount in October increased by more than 34.4 million yuan. Clearing and interbank deposits also increased by 17.40030131 yuan and 1 jiao.

### Securities Domestic Bonds Remain Popular

In the securities market, yesterday everyone knew that the atmosphere of peace was a one-sided effect, so many people rushed to sell at high prices. However, the actual selling of Tongkang shares gradually became rare. Most people in the market were bullish, so even a small price increase immediately caused a rise. This is still in the brewing period. Yesterday morning, Class C shares opened at a high price of 2.8 yuan. Later, Dinkan, Tongkang, Hongda, and other shares were offered for sale in large quantities, and the market price dropped in a straight line. Dafeng, Shunchang, Datong, and Changji successively bought in, while Xieda and No. 8 shares continued to flood the market. In the afternoon, the decline was smaller than the previous day, and the situation was slightly different. Various banks had a strong appetite for Class A shares, especially Lianyi, which was actively buying. Therefore, a new high price was discovered. Class C shares initially opened at 3 jiao, and selling pressure was very strong, once falling to 2 yuan. However, due to the strength of buyers, they were still pushed up to close at 3 jiao. Among them, Lianhe was the most courageous buyer. As a result, Class A and Class B shares rose, while the remaining shares rose only slightly by 2-3 jiao. The total transaction volume was 2.12 million yuan. The following is a brief table:

Stock Transactions: Bank of China 50 shares, price per share was 76 yuan.

Yesterday's public utilities stock market was very quiet. Both bulls and bears had no opportunities. Although the market situation sometimes showed an upward trend, the strong momentum could not last. Conversely, whenever prices fell, buyers were very crowded. Trading in industrial stocks was still good, while rubber stocks were in a state of paralysis. Except for one or two stocks that were slightly active, the rest were bleak.

London, 18th (Monday) Telegram: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks remained stable. The market only saw good results for the Gulaklin Rubber shares, up 7.5 pence, with a price of 15 shillings and 7.5 pence. The rest were unchanged.

Municipal Bonds Scheduled for Lottery, Steel Stocks Pay Dividends

The 16th lottery for the Shanghai Special Municipality Disaster Area Reconstruction 7% Public Bonds of the Republic of China will be held at 4:00 PM on November 27th at the HSBC Bank in this city.

The British-owned Steel Corporation Limited, managed by Jardine Matheson & Co., Ltd., will pay an interim dividend for the year 1940 on December 16th, at 1 yuan per share in national currency.

### Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market So-So

The yarn market continued to decline, still shrouded in the atmosphere of peace. Therefore, short sellers were actively selling, and the selling pressure was quite strong, causing the market's chips to loosen temporarily, and the market price declined. However, those with abundant funds remained calm and took no action. Some people also said that the recent trend in the money market is not favorable to bulls, and there is a possibility of seeing 1,200 yuan. Currently, it is softening due to environmental factors, but seeing more bearishness does not necessarily benefit the short side.

The spot yarn market opened with increased selling due to reports of renewed peace talks. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,235 yuan, down 7 yuan. However, at this time, there were many who were covering overnight short positions, and the situation was still tight. Shortly after, it rose to 1,243 yuan. Subsequently, the foreign exchange market was quiet, and rumors abounded. Short sellers were quite active, and the market price gradually declined to 1,217 yuan. However, some took advantage of the low prices to buy in due to the calm exchange rate, and the situation temporarily tightened again, slowly rising to close at 1,226 yuan. According to statistics, 7,795 bales were traded in the first half of the day. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 19 yuan. It was also found that 410 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong yesterday (19th), 2 bales were shipped to Siam, and 21 bales were shipped to Xiamen. Today (20th), 95 bales will also be shipped to Xiamen. The amount purchased by each bank is listed on the left: Dealers 7,300, Hong Kong 495, Total 7,795.

### Brazilian Cotton Sees Transactions

The current cotton situation is still good. Chinese factories are showing active demand, but the yarn market is declining again, and morale is affected again. However, inventories are shrinking day by day. Fire Machine Flower Leather bales are priced at 215 yuan, Da Zhong Ji is priced at 264 yuan, Brazilian cotton is priced at 280-285 yuan, and Meterling is priced at 293.2 yuan.

Another report: In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market was firm in the early morning. Subsequently, due to purchases by speculators and the covering of short positions by some, the closing price was more than 10 pounds higher than the previous day. India was closed yesterday.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, factories showed some interest in purchasing yesterday, purchasing about 1,000 pieces of Brazilian cotton en route. Dealers' sentiments were consistently strong, so the general expectation is that cotton prices will not fall.

### Piece Goods: Hong Kong and Guangdong Cloth Sales Slightly Increase

Yesterday's cloth market saw a slight setback, but overall sentiment remained firm. Small businesses continued to show steady demand. New transactions from Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants saw a slight increase. Sales of some fine cloth and twill fabrics saw a drop of 1 to 2.5 jiao per bolt. Colored cloth and bleached cloth remained flat. Twill and 16-pound twill flannel were notably popular due to shortages, with prices rising by around 2.5 jiao per bolt. This market saw transactions of over 600 pieces of forward contracts, with Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants purchasing over 300 pieces of blue cloth, bleached cloth, and twill, while Zhejiang and Fujian merchants purchased over 100 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and coarse and fine cloth.

East cloth transactions were sluggish, and the market was weak. The closing price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 35.40 yuan, and Dragon Head fine twill was 31.75 yuan, both down by 3 to 5 jiao per bolt compared to the previous day. Four Gentlemen broadcloth was 1.085 yuan, also down by 1 fen.

Exports on the 19th included 17 pieces of piece goods to Xiamen, 1,252 pieces to Hong Kong, and 57 pieces to Siam. On the 20th, 15 pieces were shipped to Xiamen and 180 pieces to Singapore.

Sugar Market: Both Brown and White Sugar Slightly Loosen

Yesterday's sugar market showed signs of softening again due to lackluster actual sales and weakening sentiment. The association's indicative price for spot No. 24 white sugar from foreign warehouses was 73 yuan, but no transactions occurred. Spot brown sugar was down by a small jiao to 56.40 yuan. Deliveries on the 30th of this month were quoted at 56.20 to 56.30 yuan, down by a small 4 to 5 jiao. Taikoo granulated white sugar B-mark from western warehouses was 74.60 yuan, down by a small 5 jiao. DY-mark was initially firm, with East Warehouse goods reaching 68.95 yuan, before retreating to 69.10 yuan. HX-mark from western warehouses was 69.60 yuan, and from eastern warehouses was 69 yuan, also showing a slight loosening. Standard crystal sugar No. 1 was 93.50 yuan, and Jingming crystal sugar was 95 yuan. 300 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.

North-South Goods: Walnut Prices Continue to Decline

Previously, walnuts, such as those from Qingzhou, had fallen from 94 yuan to 80 yuan. However, recent sales have remained weak, and the market continues to decline. Yesterday, 200 bags of Qingzhou walnuts were offered, but prices fell by another 18 yuan, settling at only 62 yuan. Jinan walnut meat also fell by 20 to 30 yuan, with the opening price for 10 pieces being 170 yuan yesterday.

Coal: Price of Indian Coal Turns Upward

Although the city's inventory of Indian bituminous coal is quite sufficient, new shipments are scarce, and water transportation costs have skyrocketed. As the production price has risen, owners are unwilling to sell easily, so the market price has also increased. Yesterday, the market price for Indian lump coal was 205 yuan per ton, screened lumps were 210 yuan, and coal dust was 185 yuan. Trading was unusually tight, with transactions among dealers reaching 500 to 600 tons in a single day. Retail sales by local stores included a small additional fee.

Miscellaneous Items: Cigarettes Rely Solely on Local Sales

The cigarette market has been stable for several days. Due to strict inspections in various regions, transfer companies are unwilling to take responsibility for connected shipments, and customer sales have largely stopped. Although there are a small number of exports, sales are limited, leading to a decline in wholesale transactions and reliance solely on local sales. Market prices are difficult to improve. Yesterday, prices were 1,300 yuan for Great Britain brand, 900 yuan for Old Knife brand, 849 yuan for Pinhai brand, 649 yuan for Wuhua brand, and 651 yuan for Little Fairy brand, with most being bought at the listed price. However, the Front Gate brand was relatively popular due to its scarcity and strong sales. The price for 10-cigarette packs was 328 yuan per 10,000 packs, and 327 yuan per 10,000 packs for 50-cigarette packs. The Xin Yuan Company's 20-cigarette packs of Holilai cigarettes were priced at 420 yuan due to rising raw material costs. The new price for Nanyang Company's Bank brand was 1,600 yuan for 50-cigarette packs, and 1,350 yuan for both 10-cigarette and 20-cigarette packs. (Kun)

### Last US Evacuation Ship: Carrying Evacuees, Departing Shanghai This Afternoon; Whether Additional Ships Will Be Dispatched Is Undecided; US Naval Dependents Have All Been Evacuated

The third US government evacuation ship, the Washington, arrived in Shanghai last Sunday (November 17) at noon, docking at buoys 11 and 12. Details have been reported previously. It is now learned that the ship, according to its scheduled departure, is scheduled to set sail from Shanghai southward at 1:30 PM today, heading directly to Manila before returning to San Francisco. The ferry for evacuees to board the ship is scheduled to depart from the Customs Wharf at noon today.

Bidding Farewell to Relatives Very Busy

American expatriates in Shanghai were busy yesterday (November 19) afternoon preparing for departure, either purchasing necessary items or visiting relatives to say goodbye. According to the United States President Lines, 470 to 480 Americans will be departing on the Washington, including 180 missionary dependents. Passenger ferries will depart from the Customs Wharf at 10:00 AM, 11:00 AM, and 12:00 PM in three separate trips. Once the passengers of the last ferry have boarded the ship, the Washington will immediately set sail.

Missionaries Returning Home on Vacation

Yesterday, it was learned that many American missionaries leaving China have agreed with the authorities that they will not be included in the list of evacuated expatriates. This is because the vacations for many of them were scheduled to begin next year. Now that the authorities have approved their early vacation, they will be considered to be returning home for vacation, rather than being evacuated.

Approximately One Thousand Evacuated in Three Waves

Given that nearly 500 Americans are leaving Shanghai on the Washington, the total number of Americans evacuated by the Monde Lai and Mariposa in Shanghai will reach 882. Once the Washington arrives in Manila, the number of passengers will increase to 1,200. Furthermore, the US ship, President Taft, is also scheduled to leave Shanghai this afternoon. It is reported that its tickets have been sold out, with most having been booked months in advance. The President Taft will return to California via Kobe, Yokohama, and Honolulu.

Those Wishing to Return Home Will Take Passenger Ships

As for how the remaining American expatriates in Shanghai will be evacuated after the Washington departs, the President Lines claims that it cannot make any decisions before receiving instructions from the government. Generally, the company has many passenger ships, which can be used to transport passengers, so there is no need to worry. When necessary, the government may dispatch special ships again, but it is not possible to predict this now.

Mutual Contact Plan Finalized

The American Association has completed its plan to maintain contact between the evacuated Americans. Each member will be given three copies of a blank form, indicating their temporary and permanent contact addresses in the United States. The original will be kept by the American Association in Shanghai, and the duplicates will be sent to the offices in San Francisco and New York. The New York office is managed by Admiral Yarnell, and the San Francisco office is managed by Arnold (former Commercial Counselor in China). In this way, Americans can communicate with each other after returning home and easily obtain contact information. Americans leaving on the Washington today will receive this form on board for completion.

The Washington

The Washington, which is carrying American expatriates from Shanghai today, belongs to the United States Line and has a displacement of more than 39,000 tons. It usually sails the Atlantic route. Its interior equipment is luxurious, and it is known for its beauty, comfort, and convenience. This decision to come to Shanghai, and not anchor outside the port, but to sail into the Huangpu River, makes it the largest passenger ship to enter the Huangpu River since Shanghai opened as a trading port. The illustration shows the ship's majestic appearance.

Transport Ship Gammon Left Shanghai Yesterday Morning

The US Navy transport ship Gammon, carrying the families of US Navy personnel, left Shanghai yesterday morning and sailed to Manila. US Navy officials in Shanghai stated that the Gammon did not carry the dependents of US Navy personnel stationed in Shanghai. However, after the Washington sails, there will be no dependents of US Navy personnel remaining in Shanghai.

USS Isabel to Return Next Week

The private yacht of Admiral Hart, the USS Isabel, which left Shanghai last week on a western tour, sailed west up the Yangtze River from Shanghai, passing through Zhenjiang and Nanjing before heading to Wuhu. The yacht has been cruising near Wuhu for several days on its routine winter patrol. According to US Navy news, the yacht has completed its patrol in Wuhu and is scheduled to return to Shanghai on November 25. It will then moor at the naval buoy in Yangshupu. The only Yangtze River gunboats remaining here are the Luzon and Guam, while the Oahu is currently in Hankou to reinforce defenses.

### British and American Ambassadors Stationed in Chongqing; No Intention to Return to Shanghai for the Time Being

US Ambassador to China, Johnson, has been in Chongqing for quite some time since leaving Shanghai, and British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, has also been in Chongqing for almost three months since leaving Shanghai in August of this year. Since the National Government moved its capital to Chongqing, in addition to the Soviet Ambassador to China, Pan Youxin, who is permanently stationed in Chongqing, the British and American Ambassadors have been stationed in Chongqing for an unprecedentedly long period. A Pingming News Agency reporter separately inquired about the whereabouts of the ambassadors from the British and American official offices in Shanghai yesterday. According to the British Embassy's Shanghai office, British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr is currently stationed in Chongqing and there is no news of his return to Shanghai. Furthermore, it was learned from the American Consulate General in Shanghai that US Ambassador Johnson has no plans to leave Chongqing in the near future. Currently, the ambassadors of various countries remaining in Chongqing include French Ambassador Cosme, who hastily went to Chongqing and will soon travel to North China. The British and American Ambassadors, along with Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin, are all gathered in Chongqing, which indicates that the relations between China and the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union are all close.

### Unified Distribution of Clothing to Eliminate Corruption

Each winter, various charitable organizations in this city mostly distribute winter clothing. They give it out randomly without verification. Cunning individuals often seek clothing from multiple sources and obtain many sets. However, impoverished people on the streets are never seen wearing this distributed clothing, as it is usually pawned. This situation was quite common last winter. Those familiar with the distributors could even obtain two sets per person. The truly poor and cold, on the other hand, find it difficult to receive anything. This greatly diminishes the reputation of these supposedly benevolent endeavors. With the severe cold approaching and the time for distributing clothing near again, various charitable groups, in order to discuss unified and proper methods, have scheduled a meeting at Renji Hall at 4 PM on the 21st of this month. Letters have been sent to various charitable organizations, inviting them to send representatives to attend the discussion.

### Parcels with Goods to Hebei Must Have a "Permit"

Post Office Announcement: (1) We have received a notice from the Hebei Postal Administration that all parcels containing goods sent to the Hebei postal area must be presented with a permit issued by the local "appropriate authority" or the "Joint Reserve Bank" at the time of delivery before they can be released. This is to inform everyone. (2) Individual, small parcels to Guan County, Shandong area, can now be resumed. (3) Large parcels to Qintong and Dongbiancheng in Jiangsu area can now be resumed. Small parcels to those two areas can also be resumed at the same time.

### President Roosevelt's Re-election; American Community Sends Congratulatory Telegram; Telegram to Be Sent on Thanksgiving; Thanksgiving Prayers to Include President's Thanksgiving Proclamation

Tomorrow, Thursday, is the American Thanksgiving holiday. The American community in Shanghai has not yet had a chance to celebrate President Roosevelt's re-election. They will jointly send a congratulatory telegram to the United States tomorrow morning in commemoration of Thanksgiving. The American official representatives in Shanghai will hold a ceremony at the American Consulate on Jiangxi Road, presided over by Consul General Lockhart. Judge Heimirk will read President Roosevelt's Thanksgiving Proclamation.

Thanksgiving Program

Pastor Ward will deliver a speech. The American community in Shanghai will hold a memorial service at 11 AM tomorrow morning at the British Community Church at 219 Jiujiang Road. Thanksgiving blessings will be offered. The American Women's Association will also hold separate ceremonies, presided over by Ms. Zhen Lai, the association's chairwoman, with prayers at the Women's Association. The American Rotary Club members usually hold a luncheon every Wednesday. Because Thursday is Thanksgiving, the club has notified its members that the luncheon will be postponed by one day. The U.S. Navy's Fourth Marine Regiment is also scheduled to have a day off to commemorate the occasion as usual. The First and Second Battalions of the Regiment will hold a football game at 2 PM tomorrow afternoon at the American Boy's School grounds.

Two Celebrations

The custom of Thanksgiving began with the Pilgrims. In 1621, after their first harvest, they set a date and gathered in Plymouth for Thanksgiving prayers. In 1864, President Lincoln designated the fourth Thursday of November as Thanksgiving Day. In 1939, President Roosevelt moved it forward one week because the holiday was too close to Christmas. Some supported this change, while others opposed it. Therefore, some governors in the United States still issue proclamations designating the last Thursday of November as Thanksgiving. As a result, Thanksgiving celebrations in the United States are now held in two separate weeks.

### Japan Again Uses Smoke Screen of Peace; Exposed by the United States; Real Intention Is to Prevent Aid to China; Shanghai Observer Analyzes the General Situation

According to an observer in Shanghai, Japan, seeing that the European War is raging and the British Empire has no time to look East, wants to extract itself from China and advance south with all its might. Therefore, it is transferring troops stationed in China to Hainan Island and Vietnam, preparing to act at the opportune moment. At the same time, it is launching a peace offensive against China, intending to hinder British, American, and Soviet aid to China. However, this kind of smoke screen has been used more than once. The trick is exhausted. The United Kingdom and United States will not be fooled. Today's Washington telegram states that the United States does not believe China is preparing to negotiate peace, which is tantamount to dispelling the rumors on behalf of China, without China having to say a word. As for the Japanese propaganda that Thailand has signed a mutual assistance agreement with the United Kingdom and the United States, the American government has already refuted it. The Japanese intention is nothing more than to create an excuse for launching military action against Thailand in the future, so as to blame the United Kingdom and the United States for provocation. Japan, under the pretext of attacking Yunnan via Vietnam, occupied Vietnam. Now, it is implementing the same pressure on Thailand. The lesson of French Indochina is right before our eyes. It is expected that the Thai authorities know how to handle themselves and will not imitate Poland and Czechoslovakia in competing for territory, only to perish themselves in a short time. It is the so-called mantis stalking the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.

### Travelers to Hong Kong Must Have Qualified Epidemic Prevention Certificates

Travelers from this city to Hong Kong must obtain certificates of vaccination and cholera inoculation before departure. This reporter learned that these certificates must be issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department, the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department, the Jianghai Customs Quarantine Office, or the Hong Kong Port Health Office, and must have the holder's photo attached to be considered qualified. Furthermore, they must be obtained six days before departure, otherwise they will be invalid. The smallpox vaccination certificate is valid for one year, and the cholera prevention certificate is valid for only six months. After the expiration date, revaccination or reinoculation is required.

### "Baoli" and "Jiangding" Vessels Head to Shipu after Importation

According to reporters from the Datong News Agency, the Baoli and Jiangding ships, after heading to Wenzhou, were inspected and prevented from entering the Ou River at Panshi. The two ships had to turn back and go to Shipu, where they have now entered the port and unloaded passengers and cargo. The customs brokers in Shanghai have been notified to inform the cargo owners. The Moufu and Feikang ships are still being detained in Dinghai under surveillance. However, the German Consulate has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese authorities. The Japanese have agreed to first allow passengers to disembark in Zhejiang, but the shipowners believe that sailing to Ao River is not within the blockade area. Therefore, they have firmly requested the German Consulate to continue negotiations with the Japanese for their release so that they can still sail to Ao River to unload cargo. Negotiations are still underway.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Entrusts Salvation Army to Establish Beggar Reception Center; Rotary Club's Support Makes It a Reality; Location Selected; Reception to Begin This Winter

The Shanghai Municipal Council issued a statement yesterday explaining the significance of establishing a "Beggar Reception Center," saying that the council had expressed its willingness to make overall plans to thoroughly resolve the problem of beggars in the Public Concession at the annual meeting of foreign ratepayers this year. In his speech, the chairman also foreshadowed the council's plan to set up a beggar reception center and entrust it to the Salvation Army for management.

Reception Plan Finally Completed

Now, thanks to the council's willingness to provide a location for the reception center and the Shanghai Rotary Club's enthusiastic support, this plan will soon become a reality, offering hope for a fundamental solution to this complex problem. The Beggar Reception Center will soon begin construction and at least some parts should be completed this winter for use. The location of the reception center has been selected as the council's property at the corner of Hardoon Road and Singapore Road, a large area. The Salvation Army has obtained permission from London to undertake this important public welfare work, which is commendable.

Hope for Generous Public Contributions

The council's regular income is limited and cannot be used for any relief purposes. At the same time, the Salvation Army's budget does not include the large sum of money required for this public welfare undertaking. Therefore, the funding required for the reception of beggars must be obtained from external donations. The council has previously stated this clearly in writing and at the annual meeting of foreign ratepayers. This plan is closely related to all levels of society and is also a problem that everyone should try to solve for their own benefit. It is believed that the public will be generous in donating to facilitate the project. The council has obtained the consent of the refugee relief authorities to transfer part of the entertainment tax revenue so that the Salvation Army can start the arrangements and build the facilities in advance.

Education and Training to Help People Become Self-Reliant

According to the plan, all beggars on the streets will be detained by the police and sent to the reception center, which is sponsored by the Shanghai Rotary Club and managed by the Salvation Army. The staff of the reception center will be hired by the Salvation Army. Once the beggars are received, they will be forced to stay inside and will not be released until they have obtained a sufficient guarantee. During the reception period, clothing, food, and housing will be provided by the Salvation Army, and they will be given education and work to provide them with the opportunity to reform. It should be solemnly stated that the main purpose of setting up the reception center is to help beggars become economically self-reliant, not to support them permanently and allow this group of beggars to exist forever. At the same time, it is hoped that the number of beggars in the concession can be gradually reduced.

### Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia Preparing to Move Capital Back to China

The Chinese authorities are currently paying attention to the impact on overseas Chinese if Japan advances south. Southeast Asia is an area where overseas Chinese congregate, and many of their businesses are quite large-scale. In this time of emergency, the authorities are formulating countermeasures to protect them properly. It is understood that Wu Tiecheng, chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, who recently visited Southeast Asia, and Dai Jitao, president of the Examination Yuan, who visited India and Myanmar, have been entrusted with the mission of inspecting the situation of overseas Chinese so that the authorities can quickly decide on effective measures to protect the interests of overseas Chinese. Those overseas Chinese who volunteer to return to their country will be properly settled according to their usual skills and work abilities. Since the outbreak of the war, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have not only generously donated funds to save the country, but have also enthusiastically invested in national construction. Therefore, it is generally believed that if Japan risks advancing and threatening Southeast Asia, it will encourage overseas Chinese in those areas to step up investment in their motherland to complete national construction.

### New Portuguese Community Center to Open

The Shanghai Times reports that the new premises of the Portuguese Association and the Portuguese Community Union in this city will be officially opened on the 23rd of this month by the Portuguese Minister to China, Li Ma. It is expected that 700 Portuguese nationals will attend. The new premises of the two associations are located at 1273 Avenue Joffre. The land was purchased by the Portuguese Association several months ago. It was designed and supervised by a famous Portuguese architect and has now been completed. The exterior is in Spanish style and includes reception halls. However, the Portuguese Association also plans to add buildings. When this plan is realized, the newly completed building will be converted into an auditorium. The Portuguese Association is well-known in the sports world, and its members are good at various sports. The Portuguese Community Union strongly promotes sports among Portuguese nationals.

### Sniper Incidents in Hongkou; Japanese Response

Since the recent sniper attacks on Japanese soldiers in Hongkou, the Shanghai-based Japanese Military Police Department has issued a notice to the 80,000 Japanese residents in Hongkou, urging them to cooperate with the Japanese military police to crack down on the shootings. If any cases occur, detailed information should be reported to the military police. Japanese residents living in densely populated areas, such as Yangshupu, Zhabei, and Wuchang Road, should report the living conditions and movements of nearby Chinese residents to the Japanese authorities for close surveillance. At the same time, the joint association of business circles on various roads in Hongkou once convened an emergency meeting on the 17th to discuss appropriate countermeasures to the above incidents. According to foreign news reports, the association has decided to mobilize young staff members from Japanese stores to form a self-defense corps and has applied to the Japanese consulate for approval.

### Safety Week Shows Good Signs; Great Success Possible; Propaganda Focuses on Educating the Illiterate; Patrols Deployed on Quiet Roads Yesterday; Outdoor Film Showings If Weather Is Clear Today

The English-language North China Daily News said that the police authorities of the two concessions began the Safety First campaign yesterday (the 18th). How was the result of the first day? As of this afternoon (the 19th), it is still not clear, but it is heard that traffic accidents have decreased significantly. Judging from all signs, this campaign can achieve great success.

Safety Films to Be Screened Widely

Most of those involved in traffic accidents are illiterate or Chinese residents who are not concerned about traffic safety. In order to educate them, the police authorities of the two concessions, with the cooperation of Mr. Bu of Xinhua Film Company, have filmed a movie based on the original manuscript written by Mr. Li Sili, the superintendent of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department. The movie will be screened on the roadside, describing the various possible dangers that pedestrians may encounter due to negligence.

Hopes to Outperform Last Year's Results

This kind of film was also screened on the roadside during the safety campaign last year. However, because the police authorities have gained experience last year, they can improve their methods, so this year's results are expected to outperform last year's. When the film is screened, another person will be on the side to explain it in detail. There will also be a Mickey Mouse cartoon film screened at the same time to attract the audience. Last year, no less than 150,000 viewers in Shanghai's cinemas saw the Safety First campaign film, and although the scope of roadside screenings was smaller than this year, the audience reached 50,000. It is expected that if the weather turns clear tomorrow (the 20th), this film will begin screening on the roadside in areas where illiterate Chinese gather. The film will also be screened in all playgrounds and large factories.

Essay Contest in Foreign Schools

In this Safety First campaign, major companies have provided strong support, such as providing financial assistance or donating advertising space. One of the important aspects of the campaign is the printing of one million leaflets in Chinese, English, and French, which are distributed to drivers and pedestrians. To promote interest in the safety campaign, foreign schools in this city are holding an essay contest. Experts are also invited to give lectures on traffic issues in Chinese schools. The campaign is progressing enthusiastically in all aspects. The people responsible for this campaign in the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department are Deputy Director Beck and Superintendent Li Sili.

Patrols Deployed on Quiet Roads Yesterday

Yesterday, the Safety campaign in the two concessions continued to be implemented according to the original plan. In addition to hanging eye-catching slogans and leaflets in various places as before, a large number of police officers were assigned to the major intersections, and they worked very hard. Therefore, pedestrians and vehicles were able to maintain good order. In order to increase the effect, the authorities also dispatched patrols to some quiet roads within the boundary that were not often patrolled yesterday to ensure traffic safety. In addition, the city's radio stations, cinemas, and announcers also cooperated as usual and did their best to publicize, and the impact on viewers and listeners was very widespread.

Propaganda Continues Despite Light Rain

It was drizzling in this city from early yesterday morning, but the college students who volunteered to promote the Safety campaign still divided into small groups and stood in groups of three or five in the rain at major traffic intersections, guiding pedestrians to pay attention to traffic rules and distributing the various Safety campaign leaflets they carried, explaining the dangers of accidents, etc., which is admirable. The General Vehicle Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, starting yesterday, distributed various finely printed traffic accident cartoons to major companies, pharmacies, etc., and posted them in the display windows along the roads. For example, the display window of the China and Western Pharmacy on the Fourth Road had posted this huge cartoon yesterday. When pedestrians passed by, they stopped on the side of the road and watched with attention.

All Sectors Generously Provide Assistance

The various Safety campaign films produced by the Safety Campaign Committee have been screened in all cinemas in this city starting yesterday, for the first few minutes before each screening. It is also scheduled to be screened free of charge in the various squares of the Public Works Department this week. For public organizations, factories, schools, etc. in this city, it is stipulated that if the number of people is between 400 and 500, they can write to the committee to bring the Safety film to them for screening. This reporter also learned from the General Vehicle Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council that it has now received donations from all sectors. The transportation companies include Xiang Sheng, who donated 400 yuan; Silver, who donated 200 yuan; Yun Fei, who donated 100 yuan; Gu Zhong Tobacco Company, who donated 400 yuan; American Shanghai Barge Truck Company, who donated 100 yuan; British Electrical Music Enterprise Company, who donated three types of Safety records, each with ten copies, for radio station use. The China and Western Freight Vehicle Industry Association also solicited donations from major vehicle dealers to support the Safety campaign's printing and film costs.

### American Linguist Advises Americans to Learn Chinese Mandarin; Do Not Just Learn Shanghai Dialect; Must Also Pay Attention to Chinese Writing

Dr. Laffler, an American professor of linguistics at the National Medical College, gave a speech at the American Chamber of Commerce in this city yesterday, advising the Americans who are learning Chinese to learn Chinese Mandarin, and not just the Shanghai dialect, and also advised them to learn to write at the same time. Otherwise, the level of their Chinese language proficiency may not be higher than that of Chinese coolies. Mr. Lai also addressed the misconception among Americans that Chinese is difficult to understand. He said that the modern vernacular Chinese currently in use is no longer as difficult to understand as classical Chinese.

### Eighth Period of Low-Priced Rice Said to Be Ordered

The authorities of the two concessions have stated that they will take a supportive attitude to help stabilize rice prices in the city, but all parties respect the opinions of the two authorities and hope that they will exercise their powers and take effective steps. In view of the high rice prices, which are of great importance to the livelihood of the common people and social order, and that there is now an adequate supply of rice and smooth shipping from abroad, the two authorities, in order to plan ahead, have again authorized the Pricing Committee to formulate concrete measures to address both the symptoms and the root causes, and to supervise the various rice industry associations to handle them separately. The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation once suggested that the authorities of the two concessions purchase large quantities of rice from rice-producing areas, set up public warehouses in the concessions, and implement stockpiling. Now, because the international situation is unstable and people are nervous, rice prices fluctuate up and down. It is hoped that the authorities of the two concessions will adopt this suggestion, consider it carefully, refer to Hong Kong's rice stockpiling method, and formally implement it on a regular basis. As for the rice merchants who often say that the production price of foreign rice is high, according to inquiries, rice merchants in Saigon, Siam, and other places set their prices based on the rice price in Shanghai. Speculative rice dealers all bulk purchase and conclude deals when the production price of foreign rice is low, trying to transport and store them in Shanghai, waiting for the international situation to change. Then, they make excuses that the source of foreign rice has been cut off, hoard the goods, and raise prices, making people uneasy. The market price will eventually rise, and each bag can make a huge profit of more than ten yuan, yet they still excuse it as a legitimate profit, which is still not enough. The Low-Priced Rice Association, in view of this, has decided to continue to hold the eighth period, even though the seventh period has ended yesterday. A batch of tribute rice has been ordered for use, and the arrival date in Shanghai is next month.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Health Office Can Help Catch Rodents; Situation in Ningbo Has Eased

Recently, the plague occurred in Ningbo, and the situation has eased after the local authorities made every effort to disinfect and exterminate. This plague has aroused concern in various sectors of the city. The Ningbo Hometown Association is soliciting donations from all sectors to exterminate the plague. It is said that the source of this plague in Ningbo is unknown. It is heard that the plague occurred recently in Nong'an near Changchun in Northeast China, and more than 200 people died. However, the scope of the plague area in Ningbo this time is very small, so it should not be difficult to exterminate. In Shanghai, the Port Epidemic Prevention Department of the Customs House once examined a traveler from Hong Kong in 1927 who had the plague. Its symptoms were sudden fever, swollen tonsils, and septicemia of the skin. The incubation period was two days for some, seven days for others, and very few were more than ten days. The disease developed rapidly and led to death. Generally speaking, the prevention methods can be to use airplanes to spread plague vaccine in the plague area to exterminate it and to implement isolation in the plague area. Strict inspections and disinfection should be carried out on travelers, ships, and vehicles from the plague area. The most important prevention method locally is to exterminate rodents. If rodents are found living in houses, the health authorities must be notified to send someone to catch them. The Shanghai Municipal Council Health Office has a rat-catching section. Citizens can request the office to send someone to catch them at any time. According to the bureau's statistics, the section kills approximately 30,000 rodents per month at the request of citizens.

### Stamp Tax Stamps Will Be Printed on Documents

Since the Ministry of Finance transferred the stamp tax to the Direct Tax Office, it has been actively planning and reorganizing it, and significant progress has been made. It has begun to strictly enforce inspections. In order to facilitate the use of the stamp tax stamps by the public, it is now planning to print the stamp tax stamps directly on various application documents for widespread use throughout the country. It will be promoted in Chongqing and other places first and then popularized throughout the country.

### Illegal Profiteering by Street Vendors; Insufficient Weight of Lard

Gan Hongkui, stall No. 55 in the Seymour Road vegetable market, was fined 50 yuan by the court on the 15th of this month after the Shanghai Municipal Council Price Investigation Office found that he was selling lard with insufficient weight. Zhao Rusong, stall No. 100 in the same vegetable market, was also fined 20 yuan by the court on the same day for selling lard at excessively high prices. This was done to serve as a warning.

### Medical Report of Renji Hospital

According to Renji Hospital's October report, there were 13,890 outpatients, 33 male suicides, 32 female suicides, and 28 factory accident injuries. Although the number of outpatients this month was less than that of last month, the work of inpatients increased by 10%. The prevalent dengue fever continued to be unusually rampant, which is worrying. Factory injuries were less than the average of the past two years, which is undoubtedly due to the reduction of work in factories in the city. Suicide incidents were lower than usual, which is fortunate. Miss Smith has worked hard and is on vacation. Now that her vacation in England is over, the hospital welcomes her back to work.

### Howard's Visit to Shanghai: An Analysis of the Indian Political Situation (Part 2)

This kind of political instability only makes the world laugh. Supporters of Gandhi in England, America, and elsewhere will likely be very unhappy, as they believed Gandhi's ideals would eventually succeed. Some observers believe that the leaders of the Kuomintang (KMT) are currently wavering on a divergent path, hoping that either Germany will win and be grateful for their lack of support for the government, or that England will win and pardon their actions. Others believe that this decision is purely a political maneuver between the KMT and Muslims. They do not understand the severity of the current war situation; conversely, they may also deeply believe that the British government is capable of independently dealing with the war against Germany. The crux of the matter lies in the weakness and lack of cooperation of other parties. In other words, unless the parliamentary system is changed, the KMT will inevitably move towards a confrontational situation with Muslims. Since the British government has no legal guarantee of Muslim opinions, the power of the Muslim League will inevitably expand greatly. If the government wants to sacrifice the interests of Muslims and other minority parties to establish a Hindu regime, it may also provoke Indian rebellion. One extremely contradictory thing is that in the eight provinces, the only party that can make decisions through voting is the Muslim-Sikh party, a party hated by the oppressed classes, liberals, and royalty. However, the British government cannot adopt this plan to avoid hastily handing over control of India to that party.

However, in such a complex political situation, there are still instances of full cooperation with the British government. In the British Army and the Royal Indian Air Force, there are many Indian people who can be appointed as officers. The full development of the arms industry has also been warmly supported by both Indian labor and capital. Therefore, it is not easy for the KMT to obstruct this facility. Generally speaking, India is very fortunate today. The fields are rich with harvests, industries are developed, and the economic situation is exceptionally prosperous. In this environment, political change will not easily grow. Looking at India's financial situation again, the central government's annual revenue is 60 million pounds. The total for the eleven states is the same. Therefore, India's annual administrative expenses are 120 million pounds—this number is actually small when viewed in the context of India, which occupies 886,000 square miles and has a population of 259 million. The British government will sooner or later increase new taxes to cope with the wartime crisis. Currently, India's tax rate is very low. In recent years, huge sums of money have been remitted back to the country, and the pound has also depreciated. The state governments are making more efforts to improve the economic and social welfare of the people. The divergence of political views has not yet been seen as hindering the progress of the Indianization of various public utilities. If the British government can suppress the resistance of "non-violence," then the KMT's actions in the eight provinces, which harm others without benefiting themselves, will still not cause great harm to the entire of India.

Foreigners often believe the propaganda of anti-British elements, thinking that India is a vassal state of Britain and is under the full rule of Britain. However, it is not known that the legislative bodies of each state have the power to freely dispose of the finances, health, education, laws, and order of each state—in essence, everything that affects the daily lives of the people. And the state governments have indeed shown good political achievements in politics and management. The current problem is the lack of a complete political structure, and the KMT is eager to seize control of the entire country. The British government has already formulated a more liberal constitution, but to implement this constitution, it must first obtain full cooperation among the various political parties in India. In fact, India is not being oppressed by Britain. On the contrary, with the cooperation of Britain and India, a free political system will soon be produced, and India will obtain greater protection.

### Romantic Russian Woman Accused of Fraud by Husband; Promiscuity with Other Men Leads to Request for Annulment of Marriage; Russian Woman Objects, Court Adjourns for Deliberation

A White Russian named Polosin (transliteration) recently filed a lawsuit with attorney Zhou Yongding at the Civil Division of the First Special District Court, accusing his wife, Kustschemlidia (transliteration), and requesting an annulment of their marriage. The court accepted the case, and yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Ni summoned the defendant, Kustschemlidia, along with her attorney, Sandikov, to court for questioning. First, the plaintiff, Polosin, testified that he is 37 years old, a White Russian, residing at 565 Huishan Road, and is in partnership with others in running an alcohol factory.

Lacking a wife, in May of this year, a friend named Gusishengzuofu (transliteration) stated that the defendant, Kustschemlidia, was a virtuous young woman, waiting to be married. Gusishengzuofu then introduced them, and the defendant declared to the plaintiff that she was a virgin and willing to form a lifelong alliance with the plaintiff. The plaintiff, believing the defendant's words, had Gusishengzuofu as a matchmaker, and held a wedding with the defendant on June 3 at the Russian church on Avenue Conty in the French Concession. But on the first night of the marriage, he discovered that the defendant was not a virgin.

After living together on Avenue Joffre for a week after the wedding, he discovered that the defendant, while the plaintiff was out, brought her old lover, Jute (transliteration), to the residence to chat. When the plaintiff questioned her, the defendant admitted that Jute was her lover. Three weeks after the marriage, the defendant went to Harbin under the pretext of escaping the summer heat, taking 2,500 yuan in cash from the plaintiff. The plaintiff took the defendant as his wife, and in less than a month, over 7,000 yuan was squandered. Unexpectedly, shortly after the defendant arrived in Harbin, a friend telegraphed that the defendant was having a new affair. In September, the defendant returned to Shanghai, still seeing her lover Jute, and did not live with the plaintiff. Recently, she even reported to the Japanese that the plaintiff was a Communist, attempting to trap the plaintiff in prison. The defendant's attorney instructed two Japanese to threaten the plaintiff. Given these circumstances, the defendant is clearly deliberately making things difficult for the plaintiff, so he requests the court to approve the annulment of the marriage. The plaintiff also presented a bedsheet used on the first night of the marriage as evidence, stating that there were no bloodstains on the bedsheet, proving that the defendant was not a virgin before the marriage. The defendant, Kustschemlidia, claimed that she is 23 years old, and her parents are both White Russians but have naturalized as Chinese citizens. The defendant herself is also a Chinese citizen, currently residing at 232 Hatong Road. She had already lost her virginity before marrying the plaintiff, and the plaintiff was also not a virgin. Before the marriage, the plaintiff claimed to have assets of over 100,000 yuan, requesting to form a happy family with the defendant. Unexpectedly, after the marriage, the plaintiff repeatedly made excuses to make things difficult for the defendant, but the defendant does not want a divorce. The plaintiff's attorney stated that it is a Russian custom for men to proudly display a red cloth after the first night of marriage. The defendant's attorney stated that this is an evil custom of the 18th century, and now even most of the young women studying in churches are not virgins. The two sides argued for a long time about whether there was fraud in the marriage. Judge Ni believed that the facts were clear and announced the adjournment for deliberation.

### Robbery on Chengdu Road; Gunfire to Resist Arrest; One Thief Shot and Another Captured; Stray Bullet Wounds a Woman

At around 5:40 PM yesterday, four robbers arrived at No. 27, Lane 842, Chengdu Road in the Public Concession. Three of the robbers were armed with pistols, threatening silence, intending to rob property. Fortunately, the victim was alert and slipped out of the back door, secretly reporting to the police. The police quickly dispatched a patrol car to the scene. The robbers, realizing they had been discovered, hastily fled. A large number of police officers followed closely behind. In desperation, the robbers opened fire to resist arrest, and the police also returned fire. The two sides exchanged over ten shots, with bullets flying everywhere. The robbers retreated while fighting. When the police chased them to Shanhaiguan Road, one robber named Xu Zhengong (30 years old) was shot in the buttocks and collapsed on the road. Another robber was arrested on the same road, and three pistols and many bullets were seized. When they chased to Mei Bai Ke Road and Qingdao Road, a stray bullet wounded a Shaoxing woman, Qian Xu (43 years old, residing at No. 5, Yongqing Lane, Avenue Joffre), in the right lower abdomen and right leg, each hit by one bullet. The bullets pierced through. An ambulance was called, and the wounded robber was rushed to the Ward Road Police Hospital. The wounded woman, Qian Xu, was carried to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The arrested robber was taken to the police station for investigation.

### Foreign Robbers Sentenced to Prison

Korean rogue Da Guzi recently joined forces with a mixed-race person, Luo Zhen, who does not recognize British citizenship. They secretly gathered in the Central Hotel and Yanzike, plotting crimes. Relying on their weapons, they specialized in robbing money from various restaurants, such as the Wuweizhai at No. 76 Jing'an Temple Road and various restaurants at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Henan Road. However, when robbing Wuweizhai on the 27th of last month, the plan was not well-conceived and was discovered by the police. Da Guzi was shot down by the police. Although Da Guzi and Luo Zhen both escaped at the time, they were eventually arrested by the police. Da Guzi was sent to the Japanese consulate, and Luo Zhen, along with a pistol and six bullets, was sent to the First Special Court. After questioning, it was learned that Luo had also defrauded a Westerner, Lei Na, of a typewriter at No. 658 Sichuan Road. The interrogation has ended. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu announced the verdict: Luo Zhen was sentenced to six years and ten months in prison for repeatedly committing armed robbery by breaking into residences, and four months in prison for fraud, to be executed as seven years in prison, with six years of deprivation of civil rights. The pistol and bullets are temporarily stored in the police station. The defendant did not accept the verdict and will appeal to the Second High Court.

### Mysterious Male Corpse Found on North Sichuan Road, Old Bazizi Road

At around 8:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 18th), a male corpse was suddenly discovered by passersby on an open space near the Japanese San Ying Company construction site on North Sichuan Road, Old Bazizi Road, Hongkou. The corpse was around 24 or 25 years old, and there were no injuries on the body, so the cause of death is unknown. The police are currently investigating.

### Notes on Robbery Cases

At 9:45 AM yesterday, a small car suddenly arrived in front of a fur store at No. 1118, the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Gordon Road. Five robbers were inside, each armed with a pistol. They rushed into the store, threatening the shop assistants not to make a sound. Then they began to rob, lasting about 20 minutes before speeding away in the car, destination unknown. After the incident, the store checked and found that 2,000 yuan in cash, 80 squirrel skins worth over 1,000 yuan, and a diamond ring worth 3,500 yuan in total had been robbed.

At around 10:05 PM on the night of the 18th, six robbers broke into the Deyong Foreign Firm at No. 352 Ward Road, Hongkou, carrying pistols and sharp blades. They threatened the owner, Japanese Deyong Shouping (50 years old), and tied up all five employees in the firm. They rushed upstairs, ordering the female owner to hand over 4,000 yuan in Japanese military scrip. They then fled in a car without a trace.

On this isolated island, filled with darkness and sin, it is easy for a young person to go astray. People who care about and serve youth affairs should take responsibility to instill the four aspects of moral, intellectual, physical, and social education into the hearts of every young boy and girl, so that they become healthy, lively, and personable youth who move forward.

A week passes quickly, but this is still a beginning, like sowing the first seed—we must not underestimate a small seed. If every family, every elementary school, and every middle school can respond and pay attention, taking the four aspects of education as the center of educating children or students, I dare say that we will surely bear abundant fruit. This is also the harvest that the Youth Association hopes to achieve by launching this Youth Four Aspects of Education Week.

Hawthorne's Detective Cases

### The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 11 Zhao Boxiong's Confession

Zhao Boxiong bowed at a ninety-degree angle again. "Mr. Hawthorne, I don't know how to describe my gratitude and admiration for you. However, I have one more request. When you report this, if you can leave me some room, let me have a chance to start anew, then I will never forget you in my life." He bent over again and walked towards the door of the room. At the door, he stopped again, turned his head, and said, "Mr. Hawthorne, Mr. Bao, goodbye... Alas, I still have to say one more thing, although Lilan is dead, she still has several accomplices. One of them is a woman named Bao Yumei, who is also a key member. If you give me a chance to redeem myself, let me complete this unfinished task, then I will definitely do my best."

Hawthorne nodded and said, "Okay, go ask Lao Mao, maybe you can get some information about this Bao person. But I don't think Jiang Anna and Yu Gantang would have accomplice relationships, would they?"

Zhao Boxiong shook his head. "No, even that Lu person doesn't know she's doing such a thing." Then he turned around, still pretending to be old, bent over and walked out of the office door. Hawthorne also just nodded at the door, not seeing him off.

At this time, Auntie Su had brought our dinner. Hawthorne stretched out lazily, looking very tired, but his face was no longer as tense as before. Before I could speak, he said to me, "Bao Lang, I know you will have many questions as usual. But the dinner will get cold, let's talk after dinner, you can bear it, right?"

Of course, I could not raise any objections, but because my mind was filled with all kinds of doubts, it quickly affected my appetite. My usual two bowls of rice were cut in half. Hawthorne was different from the situation at lunchtime. His appetite had returned to normal, which shows that the case had reached the end, and his tense nerves had also relaxed. After dinner, Hawthorne lit his cigarette as usual and sat on the sofa. He lay comfortably on the sofa, his legs also stretched out straight.

After I lit a cigarette, I followed his instructions and began to ask questions. "Hawthorne, I didn't expect this case to end like this, the real murderer is not Zhao Boxiong!"

Hawthorne exhaled a puff of smoke and suddenly stopped me and said, "What? This is a love-hate murder case, you already knew that. How can you say you didn't expect it?"

I was stunned for a moment and couldn't answer. I looked at Hawthorne's face, and he didn't seem to be joking or deliberately mocking me. (171)

### Lamentations of a Starving Man

— Junxiang

"In reality, starving is more painful than dying—the pain before death is only a moment, but from starvation to death, you have to go through a long period of torture—we can't bear it, so we would rather commit suicide and throw our lives into oblivion early, to escape this terrible hell on earth..."

"When we are so hungry that we have no other choice, we have to 'drink water' to relieve the emergency; but drinking water is not a solution either—our bellies swell up, but our bodies are still weak and our eyes are still blurred; sometimes it's even more uncomfortable to be bloated..."

"Sir, now we can't even sweep up rice scraps anymore—the 'masters' on the trucks and the clerks in the rice stores get to it first, leaving us with leftovers—Sir, think about it, more than a dozen people are vying to sweep up and down, how many grains can each person sweep up?—Going back and picking out the trash, it's not even enough to cook a bowl of thin porridge..."

This is a most tragic scene, dear readers, please close your eyes——

A twilight evening with a hurricane raging.

A naked female corpse lies on the muddy ground.

A four or five-year-old child is crawling on the woman's chest.

Not understanding that his mother will no longer pay attention to him, he pushes his mother like he used to, humming in his little mouth:

"Mommy, rice, rice..."

Rainwater hangs on his little bald head and on the purple chest of the female corpse...

I am holding a bowl of rice porridge mixed with vegetables left over from yesterday, sitting at the door eating heartily. A ragged, starving man is pacing in front of me, his hungry eyes staring intently at the rice in my hand.

"Sir," he calls out in disbelief, "do a good deed and give me a bowl to eat..."

"I only have one bowl of rice myself," I honestly reply.

"Then, give me a little from your bowl!"

I am angered by his impoliteness and glare at him angrily.

"Humph!" He actually laughs coldly with composure, "That day will come someday; a small trick, I'm telling you: everyone eats when there's rice, if you don't give it, we'll reach out and grab it!"

"When our bellies are so hungry that it's unbearable, we are like a mad dog that has lost its mind, not knowing what shame is, what breaking the law is, we just grab whatever we can find to eat!"

"One day, I stole a fried dough stick from a woman's basket. Just as I stuffed it into my mouth, I was caught and hit several times on the back and face; but I finally finished eating that fried dough stick."

"They scolded me, laughed at me, and said I was a 'cheap bone'; but this 'cheap bone' of mine is not afraid of being ashamed, I only know that my belly is a little better..."

"...Don't look at us being so thin that only skin and bones are left, don't look at our eyes sunken in, and our legs as thin as chicken feet—when the poor revolt, even the sky will collapse! Rice warehouses, coal yards, what's there we can't go to!"

"Sir—let me call you sir—it's better for everyone to be a little more lenient, a large group of starving people is not easy to deal with!"

### Keye Luke, Son of Chan, the Detective, Leaves Hollywood to Open a Farm in California; Will Return to Ancestral Home This Year

— Zhongyi

Keye Luke, the Chinese actor famous in Hollywood for playing the son of the great Chinese detective Chan, the Detective, resigned from his role as Little Chan after Warner Oland's death and Sidney Toler taking on the Chan role. Luke was originally a student studying in the United States, having been abroad for nearly twelve years. Since leaving Hollywood, he has set up a small antique shop in Los Angeles. Zhongyi News Agency was informed by Mr. Qu, a gold mining owner in Hong Kong, that Luke recently sent him a letter saying that he will be setting up a farm in California and raising rabbits and alfalfa. He also said that if all goes well, he will return to his ancestral home after the farm is established. Luke's ancestral home is Taishan, and he studied economics in the United States, earning a bachelor's degree from a university. Later, he joined Hollywood and abandoned his studies. Although his position in Hollywood is not as good as that of Anna May Wong, Wong Chung Hon, etc., he is also quite well-known. However, because the role he plays is always the son of Chan, the Detective, and he is often assigned by the director to be the source of jokes, he is quite resentful. He has repeatedly wanted to quit acting, but due to contractual relationships, he could not refuse. This may also be one of the biggest reasons why Luke left Hollywood to form his own farm.

### "From Stage to Screen"

— Hai Xing

Feng Zi Writes and Expresses Opinions

The famous stage actress Ms. Feng Ziren (Feng Zi), recently completed her screen debut "Hometown of White Clouds," and subsequently published a short article in Chongqing. We are pleased to publish it in its entirety as follows:

Many people have moved from their love of the stage to the camera. General anecdotes suggest that filming is inferior to stage performance in terms of moving an art lover's heart. I agree with this statement, but I would like to add that filming movies requires even more hardship, resilience, perseverance, and determination than performing on stage. If you wholeheartedly immerse yourself in this career, after five, ten, or even decades of experience, you may achieve some success. This emerging art form has been introduced to China for twenty years, but only a few have truly left their mark. The main reason is that this industry also has its difficult steps, and the general public often overlooks this most important point.

Taking advantage of my visit to Chongqing, I participated in the production of "Hometown of White Clouds." This work was unfamiliar to me. When I arrived at the set, the first thing that moved me was the seriousness and enthusiasm of the staff. These are all unnamed heroes who deserve our respect. In this unfamiliar environment, we realized that we need to have more of a learning spirit to join the ranks of this work as a soldier.

Letter

### "Regarding Sai Jinhua"

Editor:

Having read Chen Qi's article in your column "Profiles of Female Artists," I feel compelled to clarify a few points: (1) I have never visited the China United Film studio since it became an occupied territory, nor have I met Mr. Zhu Shilin. (2) The material for "Sai Jinhua" was borrowed by Mr. Tu Guangqi. I initially opposed the filming, but Mr. Guangqi said that everything was prepared, so I could only suggest that it would be best to write about the late Qing Dynasty, based on my adaptation, emphasizing the line of Cuiyun Niang, and using my interpretation of Sai Jinhua's way of saving the country.

(3) There was absolutely no discussion about actors, and I neither recommended nor suggested anyone to play any particular role.

(4) I learned that the movie Sai Jinhua story was written until Sai Jinhua's death, featuring Xiao Pu Hu (Kumamoto), Cuiyun Niang, and Shan'er (my adaptation). At the time, I found it strange because the characters of Xiao Pu Hu and Cuiyun Niang were typical, and Cuiyun Niang and Shan'er were typical in terms of progressiveness, which seemed redundant. I immediately wrote a letter to Mr. Zhu, suggesting removing one of them. Mr. Zhu agreed and gave me a reply.

The facts are as such, and I hope you will publish this.

### Rosaline Lochsane, White Brian, and Yaheng in a Scene from "The Vase Lady" (National Arts Pictures)

### Profiles of Female Artists

— Tang

Ying Yin, she has a healthy physique, born in the old capital, twenty-five years old this year. Her father died two months after her birth, so she had no knowledge of her father. Her mother, unfortunately, also passed away in Beiping last month. Due to circumstances, Ying Yin was unable to return for the funeral, which is her only regret recently.

Ying Yin is a daughter of the northern country, but her mother was from Hainan Island. Ying Yin's father fled to Hainan Island in his youth, making a living by hunting. One day, he pulled a young girl out of a trap he had set for animals. She had fallen in unintentionally, so he took her in. Later, he brought her to Beiping, and with the permission of the elders, they finally became a married couple. This is the origin of Ying Yin's mother. Ying Yin often tells this story as a legend.

Ying Yin's birthplace was the Lianhua Dance Troupe. Her screen debut was "Fire of Passion and Blood." She has a healthy physique and speaks fluent Mandarin, so she was highly regarded at that time. Later, she was recruited by the Star Film Company and made many films. Her dedication to drama began when she played the role of Hua Yueying in the Amateur Experimental Theater's performance of "The Desire Demon." Her skilled acting amazed everyone in the drama world. After that, she gained fame for starring in "Wu Zetian."

After the war shifted west, she wandered to Chongqing, engaging in drama activities in the rear. Shortly before she left Chongqing, she also starred in Lao She's debut play "Remnants of Fog." Later, she returned to Shanghai at the invitation of the owner of the United Film Company. Originally, she was scheduled to star in "Empress Dowager Cixi," but due to script and casting issues, it could not be realized for the time being. Therefore, they changed to filming "Sai Jinhua," with Ying Yin playing the role of "Sai Erye, whose beauty illuminated history." It is now about eighty or ninety percent completed and should be finished by the end of this month.

The New Arts Drama Society's second play has been decided to star Ying Yin. The play is titled "The Tale of the Hairpin and Blood," still written by Wei Ruhui, and rehearsals have begun on the fifteenth. It may be staged next month.

Ying Yin is a straightforward woman. She is not bothered by the recent news reports about her love affairs. In fact, she currently lives alone in Taoyuan Village on Lafayette Road. Besides two maids, her only companion is a small Tommy—a completely white Shih Tzu—that she recently bought for fifteen yuan. (Tomorrow: Tang Laoqing)

(13) Visiting the Former Nunnery

"Visiting the Former Nunnery" is a scene where Shen Guisheng visits the Fahua Nunnery and flirts with the third nun, Zhi Zhen.

Upon arriving at the Hall of the Child-Giving Guanyin, Shen Guisheng asks what this female Bodhisattva is in charge of. Zhi Zhen tells him that this is the Child-Giving Guanyin, and couples who come together to pray for children will be able to have a son. Shen Guisheng says, "I am eager to have a son, but my wife did not come with me. Can the Third Nun accommodate me?" He also asks why the Maitreya Buddha is laughing. Zhi Zhen says he is laughing at you for not studying hard! Shen Guisheng says, "She is laughing at you for wasting your beautiful face in the sounds of chants!" At this point, even though Zhi Zhen's heart is like an ancient well, it cannot help but ripple. (See picture)

(14) Visiting the Later Nunnery

Sixteen years after Shen Guisheng "declared his love and died" at the Fahua Nunnery, his posthumous son, Yuanzai, has already become famous through his studies. After much investigation, he learns that his birth mother is the nun Zhi Zhen of the Fahua Nunnery.

"Visiting the Later Nunnery" is the story of Shen Yuanzai visiting the nunnery to recognize his mother.
