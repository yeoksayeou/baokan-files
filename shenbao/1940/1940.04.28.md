### Great Victories on the Borders of Shanxi and Henan: Chinese Armies Attack the Remnants of the Japanese Forces from the South and North, Encircling Them in the Jincheng and Bo'ai Areas; Chinese Forces Fiercely Attack Key Points on Both Sides of the Daoqing Railway

Yangcheng: The Japanese troops in Yangcheng, Fushan, and Yicheng, since the 20th, mustered over ten thousand troops, advancing in several directions towards the eastern and western areas of Qinshui City, attempting to invade Yuanqu and occupy the west bank area of Qinshui. After being met by the Chinese army in Zhangmazhen, Zhongcunzhen, Xingyu (all southwest of Qinshui), Meigou (northwest of Qinshui), and the opposite bank of Zhengzhuang (east of Qinshui), fierce battles broke out. The Chinese army divided the invading Japanese into several sections. Two groups of Japanese troops rushing from Yicheng to reinforce were intercepted by the Chinese forces in Shangge Village, Lijiapo, Sungou, and Wayaogou, all located on the southeast side of Yicheng. As of the 24th, of the Japanese who fled from Fushan and Yicheng, only about two thousand infantry and artillery remained, retreating southward. On the same day, they were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army in the Foye Temple area of Liucunzhen (both northwest of Yangcheng), and the Japanese retreated towards Yangcheng. The victorious Chinese armies then fiercely attacked Yangcheng, completely recovering it by the evening of the 25th. The Japanese army fled towards Zhoucun (east of Yangcheng), and the Chinese army is currently pursuing them fiercely. Furthermore, close contact has been established with the various armies advancing south from Lingchuan and Gaoping, and north from Jiyuan and Qinyang, tightly encircling the Bo'ai and Jincheng areas, aiming to annihilate the stubborn Japanese forces. (Telegraph from the 27th)

Lingchuan: Since the 20th, the Japanese army in southern Shanxi has launched an all-out invasion southward. Various routes of escape from Changzhi, Changzi, and Huguan, totaling about twenty thousand troops, are attempting to occupy the area east of Qinshui in order to open up transportation between the Baijin Highway and the Daoqing Railway. The Japanese troops advancing along the Baijin Highway and on both sides of it towards Gaoping were intercepted by the Chinese army in the vicinity of Sanjiacun, Sizhuangzhen, and Yechuanzhen, north of Gaoping, and were fiercely attacked from both sides with the main force. After a bloody battle until the evening of the 23rd, all the Japanese were annihilated by the Chinese forces. The Japanese troops that came to reinforce were also defeated by the Chinese army. Unable to return to their nests via the original route, the remnants scattered into the mountainous areas northwest of Gaoping. The Chinese army then separately searched and eliminated them. By the 25th, all the remaining Japanese north of Gaoping had been completely cleared. The Chinese army continued to advance, turning east to closely link up with the Chinese army in the northeast of Lingchuan, and launched a fierce attack on all sides against the Japanese who had infiltrated Lingchuan on the night of the 22nd. After half a day of bloody fighting, the Japanese were completely annihilated, and Lingchuan was immediately recaptured. This resulted in the Japanese forces fleeing from Lingchuan to Jincheng on the 23rd having their rear completely cut off by the Chinese forces in Lingchuan and Gaoping. The Chinese army then tracked them down from both sides of Gaoping and various parts of Lingchuan to Jincheng. On the afternoon of the 26th, countless Japanese military supplies and horses were seized along the way, and the main force advanced fiercely along the major roads from Lingchuan to Huojia, passing through both sides of Guitao Mountain (south of Lingchuan), and the major roads from Lingchuan to Xiuwu, towards key points on the Daoqing Railway. (Telegraph from the 27th)

Luoyang: The Japanese troops along the Daoqing Railway in northern Henan, east of Xinxiang, have mostly been transferred to Kaifeng for reinforcement. The Chinese army on both sides of this section of the railway, in order to coordinate with the operations in the suburbs of Kaifeng, has begun to fiercely attack various key points along this section, making smooth progress. The Japanese troops in Bo'ai, at both ends of the Daoqing Railway, have been rushing to rescue the remnants of the Japanese forces besieged in southeastern Shanxi, and have been invading the Tianjingguan area southwest of Jincheng for several days. The Chinese army on the north bank of the Yellow River, in coordination with the Chinese army advancing south from Linxian and Lingchuan, has launched a large-scale operation from Jiyuan, Mengxian, Wenxian, Qinyang, and Wuzhi, crossing the Qinshui River in droves, completing a large encirclement, and launching an attack on the western section of the Daoqing Railway. Another route has advanced to the vicinity of Tianjingguan, intercepting the Japanese forces invading from the north and south, and fierce fighting is currently underway. (Telegraph from the 27th)

Luoyang: A group of Japanese troops invading south from Zhangdian in southern Shanxi was repelled by the Chinese army near Luyan Village. The remnants fled to the Wangjiagou and Liujiacun areas (both southeast of Zhangdian).

One group engaged in a bloody battle with the Chinese army near Xiaopoling. The Chinese army intercepted and killed them from multiple directions, inflicting countless casualties. Another route fiercely attacked the Nangou area (southwest of Maojia Mountain), where the Chinese army killed over six hundred and eighty Japanese troops.

The Chinese army intercepted them layer by layer. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the Japanese suffered over a thousand more casualties. Especially in the battle in the suburbs of Wangyuan Village, east of Yandi, the Japanese released a large amount of smoke to harass the Chinese army.

The telegram is signed by General Zhu De, Commander of the Eighteenth Group Army (the new name after the expansion of the Eighth Route Army), followed by Peng Dehuai, Deputy Commander of the Army, Ye Ting, Commander of the New Fourth Army, and Xiang Ying, Deputy Commander, among others. (Reuters telegraph from the 27th) After two and a half years of preliminary investigation by the Tokyo District Court, it has been decided to transfer the case to the criminal court for public trial in the near future. The Japanese government dissolved the Japan Labor Union and the Japan People's Party, two left-wing organizations, in December of that year, and their leaders were also arrested.

Editorial

### The Plight of Japanese Diplomacy

Although Japan's aggression against China is unanimously condemned by the international community, its diplomatic activities in the international arena have never slackened. For example, recently: (1) Kawai, a special envoy of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived in London on the 8th of this month after touring North and South American countries, and will travel to the European continent to visit France, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands. (2) Another special envoy, Ito, also left Tokyo on the 12th of this month, traveling through Siberia to Europe for activities. (3) The Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, held talks with Mikoyan, the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Trade, on the 19th of this month. Afterwards, Japanese newspapers released information stating that the Soviet government was willing to form an agreement with Japan at any cost, so that it could freely operate in Southeast Europe. However, the Soviet official news agency was immediately instructed to deny this. (4) Tokyo also publicized that Britain had proposed to Japan to conclude a new Anglo-Japanese. Later, it was also denied by Britain. In addition, (5) Japanese newspapers and magazines have been discussing particularly vigorously recently how to break the diplomatic deadlock. Japan has always exercised extremely strict control over speech, especially during wartime. Newspapers and magazines are not easy to speak freely, so talking about diplomacy and venting their dissatisfaction with political elbows is indeed a fact. However, the Japanese government and the public are deeply distressed by the setbacks in the war of aggression against China, so they want to find a way out through diplomacy, which is expressed unanimously from top to bottom.

However, this way out is not only difficult to open up, but simply impossible to open up. It is not difficult to understand by analyzing the objective situation. The main players on the Far Eastern international stage, besides China and Japan, are Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The main players on the world international stage, besides Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, are France, Germany, and Italy. If Japan wants to find a way out in diplomacy, its main targets are naturally the six countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Germany, and Italy. These six countries have their own urgencies and their own secrets, but if we analyze them in terms of the Far East issue, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France are a group, whose interests lie in maintaining China's independence, integrity, and the open door policy, and protecting their material and spiritual rights and interests in China. Germany and Italy are another group. They have fewer rights and interests in the Far East and have less significant relationships, but they are shouting in Europe to break the status quo. Japan's goal is to overturn the Far Eastern status quo and dominate China. Its natural trend is to unite with Germany and Italy to resist Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France. Therefore, from the Hirota Cabinet to the Hayashi Cabinet, the Konoe Cabinet, and even the Hiranuma Cabinet, its diplomatic direction has followed the Germany and Italy line, touting the name of the anti-communist agreement and implementing its separate aggression. However, this situation underwent a major change in August of last year. The signing of the German-Soviet Pact completely destroyed the defensive money of the anti-communist agreement. At that time, Japan had gone through more than two years of war of aggression against China, its national strength was declining, and it was difficult to sustain. It was in need of foreign aid, while Germany was stirring up war in Europe and could not take care of itself. Italy was the poorest of the great powers, and of course, it had no surplus power to assist Japan, which was mired in a quagmire. Therefore, Japan went from disappointment to despair towards Germany and Italy.

Since Japan was disappointed and despaired of Germany and Italy, it had to change its diplomatic line. Therefore, after Abe came to power last autumn, he personally served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and announced his diplomatic policy as "returning to a blank sheet of paper." The so-called "returning to a blank sheet of paper" was actually flirting with Britain and the United States, and especially unilaterally favoring the United States. At this time, the United States had just announced the abandonment of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty, and the US-Japan Commercial Treaty had not actually expired. Japan wanted to use diplomatic means to lure the United States and rekindle old flames, because of its internal political necessity to appease the people, the international necessity of attempting to blockade China, and the economic necessity of heavily relying on the United States for military supplies and foreign trade. Therefore, Nomura, known as the "American expert," succeeded as Minister of Foreign Affairs, but nothing was achieved during the term of the Abe Cabinet. In mid-January of this year, Minai came to power for only ten days, and the US-Japan relationship finally entered a non-treaty state. Moreover, since then, the United States has intensified its pressure with every step Japan takes. For example, after Japan reorganized Nanjing on March 30 and after Japanese Foreign Minister Arita made a statement on the Dutch East Indies issue on the 15th of this month, US Secretary of State Hull solemnly explained the uncompromising attitude of the United States. Even without General Dodgey's speech and the US government's strengthening of the moral embargo against Japan, anyone could understand that a compromise between the US and Japan was impossible. Therefore, Japan shifted its seduction targets to the Soviet Union and Britain, but both Britain and the Soviet Union immediately issued statements that they had no intention of showing a compromise agreement to Japan.

Combining the current international situation in the Far East, Germany and Italy have no surplus to assist Japan. Britain has considerable surplus power, and the United States and the Soviet Union have sufficient surplus power, but they do not assist Japan. Instead, they all stand in clear opposition to Japan. When the Sino-Japanese War first broke out, Japan relied on its strong military power and thought that it could conquer China in a short period of time, and that as long as it placed the accomplished fact of conquering China before all countries, all countries would have no choice. Therefore, it rushed headlong without regard for diplomacy. To be honest, if China did not resist and surrendered, like Czechoslovakia and Denmark; if China resisted and was defeated, like Abyssinia and Albania; if China abandoned the war of resistance halfway, like Finland; then Japan would have been complacent, and all countries would have had no choice but to lament. Japan did not expect the factual lessons it encountered to be a long-term war of resistance and a strong war of resistance, which made it unable to ignore the outside world. Furthermore, because of the deep quagmire of the war of aggression against China, it could only think of finding a way out in diplomacy to alleviate its military poverty, but it was not available. It is Japan's own blind aggression and disregard for objective circumstances that have created the current diplomatic predicament for Japan. Originally, the Soviet Union had vast territories in the Far East. Britain had few territories in the Far East but particularly broad rights and interests. As for the United States, its founding life is entrusted to the Pacific Ocean. France is an ally of Britain, with the same situation and shared interests. Therefore, as long as Japan does not abandon its policy of aggression against the Asian continent and the Pacific Ocean, the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France will not be able to sleep peacefully, and they will not be able to compromise with Japan. Such a major crisis of diplomatic isolation is something that Japan cannot afford. Laying down the butcher knife can lead to immediate enlightenment, and untying the bell only requires a single thought. However, today's Japan is not enough to speak of this.

### US Fleet Commander Holds Important Meeting to Discuss the Dutch East Indies and Japan Issues, Maintaining the Length of Maritime Transportation

Washington: As the commanders of the US fleet were discussing defense issues in Pearl Harbor, Acting Secretary of the Navy Compton announced that twenty more naval vessel commanders would be reassigned this summer and early autumn.

### Germany Accuses Britain and France of Intending to Expand the Scope of the European War; Ribbentrop Yesterday Released Diplomatic Documents Proving That British Troops Landing in Norway Was Premeditated; London Official Communiqué Strongly Rejects It As False

Berlin: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop today gave a speech to diplomats and journalists in Berlin, detailing how the German army preemptively and timely entered Norway in order to prevent and disrupt the Allied forces' sudden landing plan in Norway. He stated that the British army laying mines in Norwegian territorial waters on April 8 was merely a preparation for the landing of the British expeditionary force, which was already ready to depart. "We received reports that the Allied expeditionary forces embarking on ships would land at Bergen, Trondheim, and Stavanger on April 9." Mr. Ribbentrop also presented a white paper containing various documents, listing the "Details of British plans to implement actions in Norway before the German army entered Norway," to those in attendance. It is said that these documents were seized by the German army after the first engagement between the German army and the British army in Lillehammer on April 22. The German official news agency announced the release of these documents at almost the same time as the beginning of Mr. Ribbentrop's speech.

Ribbentrop claimed that since British Sea Lord Churchill's speech several weeks ago, the remarks made by British and French politicians have all contained requests for neutral countries to join the war against Germany. Mr. Ribbentrop also listed the speeches of British politicians such as Prime Minister Chamberlain, Sea Lord Churchill, Foreign Secretary Halifax, Minister of Engineering, and Cooper to prove his point. Mr. Ribbentrop then mentioned Finland, saying that the British and French claims that Norway and Sweden would allow their troops to pass through in order to assist Finland were completely untrue. It is said that the German government learned that the Finnish ambassador to France reported to his own government on March 12 that Daladier and Churchill had made firm assurances to Finland after the request was made that British and French troops would immediately depart from the port where they were ready to depart, in order to land in Norway. The two countries of Norway and Sweden would only be notified of the troops passing through with a note, and would not request the permission of the two governments. On March 11, Mr. Churchill flew to Paris to make a final effort to obstruct the peace between Finland and the Soviet Union. The documents seized by the German army in Norway further prove the British and French plot to expand the war to Northern Europe. According to the documents obtained in Narvik, it was proven that British spies along the Norwegian west coast studied good strategies for landing. Although the Norwegian government secretly sympathized with the Allied plans at the time, these spies still operated as usual. Mr. Ribbentrop also said that Mr. Churchill inadvertently revealed Britain's true purpose when hosting neutral reporters. At that time, Mr. Churchill vehemently criticized the three countries of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, saying that it was necessary to prevent iron ore from being transported to Germany. The German government was very satisfied with the information obtained from various sources regarding Sweden's attempts to consider its neutral position and its failure to violate neutrality. On the other hand, the German government has obtained documents proving that the Norwegian government not only agreed to the Allied plan to expand the war, but also actively supported the actions proposed by the Western powers. According to the information recently discovered in Norway, it can be seen that the British espionage system in Norway has the full support of the Norwegian government. We had earlier obtained evidence that the Norwegian government had decided to join the Allied side in joint operations. When the Norwegian government held a meeting on March 2, its Prime Minister and Foreign Minister both made remarks on this. In addition to the above-mentioned documents, there are many other actions of the Allies in neutral countries, such as the sabotage activities of spies in the Balkans, which can prove their intention to spread the war as much as possible.

Later, the German government learned of French Prime Minister Reynaud's non-public conversation with neutral diplomats on the 30th of the third month, and the intention of the Allies became more obvious. In this conversation, Mr. Reynaud carelessly declared that the West was no longer in danger. In the days that followed, the Western powers would take resolute action in Northern Europe. Therefore, the head of state ordered the German navy to set sail. The Allied forces laying mines on April 8 was merely a preparation for the British expeditionary force to land. We received intelligence that on April 9, the Allied forces had embarked and departed, preparing to land at Bergen, Trondheim, and Stavanger, but on the morning of the 9th, Germany's counter-action had been implemented, timely preventing and disrupting the attempt to land in Norway. After the British Admiralty knew of the German Navy's actions in the North Sea, it decided to cancel the landing attempt and recalled its main fleet. However, the British side failed to fully return its transport ships. Several of them were sunk by German bombers. Mr. Ribbentrop then mentioned British Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons regarding German aggression, saying that he is now presenting various documents in the name of the German government and truth and justice to prove that what the British and French rulers said is a lie. Mr. Ribbentrop then talked about the war in Norway, saying that the German army has broken through all enemy positions and defeated the Anglo-Norwegian Allied forces, causing them to collapse. Mr. Ribbentrop reiterated the matters mentioned in the German High Command's communiqué, saying that the several brigade orders obtained by the German army have proven that the British army's landing was prepared long ago. The orders for the first batch of troops to land were issued on April 6 and 7. Mr. Ribbentrop finally reiterated his previous remarks criticizing the Allied forces, and distributed a white paper containing the various documents he mentioned to the diplomats and reporters present. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)

### Contents of the German White Paper Reveal the Inside Story of British Military Operations

Berlin: The newly published German white paper (No. 4) briefly summarizes the content of this book in its preface. It is said that the German army obtained extremely valuable and interesting historical materials in Norway regarding the British army's plan to land in Norway (which was still a neutral country at the time) and the military measures taken by Britain within Norway, revealing inside secrets and hidden information. This can be said to be an unexpected gain for the German army. When the British and German armies first clashed in Lillehammer, the German army captured more than a dozen soldiers of the British 8th Battalion and found documents regarding the British army's plans and the orders issued by the commanders. The orders published in Category A prove that the military operations regarding landing in Norway had been planned in detail several weeks before the German side took action, and the expedition began on April 6 and 7. The 8th Battalion boarded the British cruiser "Glasgow" on April 7, prepared to depart for Norway and land in Stavanger. According to the diary of a British soldier obtained by the German army, the page for April 7 stated that the British soldiers were heading towards Stavanger. From this diary, we learned that the code used in the British army's orders, 547, referred to Stavanger. The above-mentioned documents can be used as solid evidence that the British expeditionary force had already been dispatched before the German army's attack on Norway. The assurances of British dignitaries that the Allied forces had not considered occupying the Scandinavian peninsula have been proven to be inaccurate by the orders of the British expeditionary force. The British army's landing plan was based on the intelligence of British and French officials in Norway. The German army has obtained the code and important letters of the British consul in Narvik and various documents of the French naval attaché in Norway, proving that the Allied forces had deployed a spy network in Norway. British naval personnel, under the name of consular personnel, were stationed in various Norwegian seaports. Although they were under the jurisdiction of the British Foreign Office, they still accepted the instructions of the British Admiralty's intelligence agencies. They cooperated with the British and French naval attachés in Norway. They traveled to various places to collect reliable intelligence, and the important secret instructions of the British Admiralty's intelligence agencies were transmitted by the British naval attaché in the capital of Sweden. British espionage work began at the end of last year and continued until April of this year, and all the intelligence needed to invade Norway had been obtained. British personnel often filled out various questionnaire forms, providing the intelligence needed for landing, including the most suitable docks for landing, the status of airfields, and the storage locations of coal and other fuels. The questions issued in January of this year were the most urgent. After Britain decided to land in Norway in April, it appointed a new consul stationed in Narvik, stipulating that he should take office on April 8. Due to special reasons for the appointment of the new consul, the British Admiralty obviously hoped that when troops were sent to land, there would be a confidant stationed in Narvik who understood the British plan. The French naval attaché's report proved that he had obtained the assistance of the Norwegian authorities when investigating intelligence "under the pretext of military transport to Finland." The British consul in Narvik was ordered to investigate the military deployments in northern Norway and the defense plans of various Norwegian seaports. The French naval attaché reported that a certain place in Trondheim Bay was "the best place for secret landing." British and French personnel had made detailed inquiries to officials in various parts of Norway. The Norwegian government failed to fulfill its obligations as a neutral country and assisted Britain's landing plan. Documents from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs prove that the British Ambassador to Norway requested the right for Allied troops to pass through Norway to assist Finland from the Norwegian Foreign Minister on March 2 of this year. The Allied forces had the same request for Sweden. At that time, the Norwegian cabinet held a meeting and stated that if the Swedish government accepted this request, it would also be willing to allow troops to pass through. (Haitong dispatch on the 27th)

Berlin: The German white paper published the British and French plans to invade Norway, and mentioned that Norwegian officials were actually not neutral. The Norwegian foreign minister specifically advocated at a cabinet meeting held on March 2 that there was no need to prevent Allied troops from passing through Norway to Finland. Norway only needed to make a formal protest to Gutt, and he believed that Norway should not take attitudes that would endanger assisting the enemy in combat. At that time, Norway not only tolerated Britain's violation of neutrality, but was obviously prepared to assist Britain in combat. The Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' archives prove that the Norwegian Ambassador to Britain submitted a secret report to the government on February 5, describing British Sea Lord Churchill's conversation with Norwegian reporters. At that time, Churchill admitted that the goal of British policy was to involve Sweden and Norway in the war, and that the best strategy to achieve this goal was for Sweden and Norway to assist Finland. Although the Norwegian government had understood Britain's true intentions, it continued to provide various conveniences to British spies and only made mild protests against Britain's repeated violations of Norwegian territorial waters. This attitude encouraged Britain's plan to undermine Norwegian neutrality. The Norwegian government had violated the interests of the people and deliberately assisted the Allied forces in realizing the plan to expand the war. (Haitong dispatch on the 27th)

### Chamberlain Scheduled to Make a Statement on Tuesday, Reporting on the Norwegian War Situation

London: Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to make a statement in the House of Commons on the 30th of this month, reporting on the situation of the war in Norway. Because it concerns military secrets, he will naturally speak cautiously at that time so as not to be taken advantage of by the enemy. (Havas dispatch on the 27th)

### The British Side Vehemently Rebuts the German Foreign Minister's Declaration, Accusing it of Fabricating Facts to Conceal Faults and Cover Up Mistakes

London: The London authorities issued a communiqué this afternoon rebutting Ribbentrop's speech as follows: "Ribbentrop's fabricated declaration deliberately reverses the facts from beginning to end. The world will not be slightly moved by it. He said that the war has no reason, and its reason lies in the premeditated attack on Poland. The UK and France are bound by treaty to Poland. The statement that the Allied forces are plotting to split Germany is unbelievable. The Prime Minister has made it clear that this slander is a malicious fallacy. As for the so-called British plot to attack Scandinavia, the facts are as follows: (1) The British and French governments publicly announced their decision to prevent Germany from usurping Norwegian territorial waters, so there was a decision to lay mines. (2) The Allied forces asked the governments of Norway and Sweden to allow them to pass through to transport troops to assist Finland, but they immediately gave up after being rejected. (3) The Norwegian government not only did not decide to join the Allied side to fight, but also firmly refused the Allied forces to pass through to Finland. (4) If the troops had been prepared to land in Norway, the Allied forces' assistance to Norway would not have been slightly delayed. This kind of delay is due to the temporary assembly of troops. (5) If the laying of mines was only a preparation for landing, the Allied forces would not have announced this measure. The reason why the Allied forces announced it was purely out of concern for the interests of neutral countries, and Germany has hitherto shown shameless contempt for the interests of neutral countries. (6) The German expeditionary force had set out many days before the laying of mines, which was admitted by German wireless broadcasts. (7) The German army's ability to land in Norway relied on the activities of German secret personnel. This is known to everyone. Now it is absurd and reckless to say that British personnel prepared for the British army to land. (8) The British government hopes that neutral countries should take self-defense measures to prevent German aggression. It is completely inaccurate to say that the Allied forces are plotting to expand the war. The views of neutral countries can be shown by the fact that no one has mobilized for fear of Allied aggression. The expansion of the war to the Scandinavian peninsula undoubtedly stems from the German government's deliberate actions. Now it wants to justify its actions based on so-called seized documents, but it did not consider it when the German army carried out the invasion. There is not a single word in Ribbentrop's speech that proves the legitimacy of the German army's invasion of Denmark, which is noteworthy. In Ribbentrop's mind, Denmark seems to be worthless."

### Occupation of Roluos Town, German Advance Halted, Fierce Battles in Progress at the Norwegian-Swedish Border

Stockholm, Sweden – German forces reoccupied the town of Røros in eastern Norway (within the province of Aust-Trøndelag) today. Heavy fighting is now occurring in the area between the town and the Swedish border between Allied forces (Havas, 27th). London – Norwegian military officials announced that Allied forces in Norway yesterday halted the enemy's advance in the areas of Gjøvik and Hallingdal, northwest of Oslo. The German forces used artillery and tanks in their attacks, but British forces have destroyed several German tanks. In the north, German motorized and mechanized units continue to advance towards Kvikne and Røros. German aircraft continue to bomb the Norwegian rear lines, with one plane shot down. In western Norway, German forces are advancing from Ulvik and Eidfjord, and from Bergen along the railway towards Voss. Voss is under bombardment from German artillery units from Eidfjord, and German aircraft are also bombing the area (Reuters, 27th).

Stockholm, Sweden – According to reports from war correspondents stationed in Norway, British units in the central part of the country have reached Otta and are fighting German forces at Kvam, on the Lillehammer-Dombås road. The outcome is still unknown. Observers note that the German mechanized units are now operating in snowy areas between two high mountains, which has greatly hampered their movements (Havas, 26th).

Stockholm, Sweden – News reported today states that on Thursday, 200 German soldiers arrived in Røros, south of Trondheim, carrying tanks and armored vehicles. It is reported that the German forces have detained three senior officials in the area and threatened to destroy the city if any German is harmed. As a result, the Norwegian army retreated, with one part heading north to Støren, and another part towards the Swedish border. Four hundred men have crossed into Sweden and have been detained. There are also rumors that Norwegian soldiers are crossing into Sweden at other locations, and the Norwegian authorities have issued orders to border officials to prevent Norwegian men from crossing the border (Reuters, 27th).

London – Military figures here have publicly acknowledged that Allied forces are in a difficult situation south of Trondheim, Norway. However, they say that given the Allied forces' courageous counterattacks despite the difficulties, this difficult situation was expected and there is no need to be pessimistic. According to reliable sources, German forces advancing from Trondheim have linked up with German forces on the railway line from Hamar to Trondheim. It seems that the Norwegian troops on the eastern part of the railway line have been defeated by the German forces. Although Anglo-French Allied forces have retreated to the south of Dombås, the city is still in Allied hands, so a section of the railway line to Trondheim remains under Allied control. Furthermore, the Allied side still possesses two advantages: (1) Supply to the Dombås area has not been cut off, and the morale of the Allied forces has been boosted by the arrival of fresh troops, which can still threaten Støren from Dombås. (2) The German air force was originally very rampant, but the strength of the Anglo-French air force has been replenished today, and a balance should be restored in the future. The Allied side is now equipped with a large number of anti-aircraft guns and fighter groups to resist German aircraft. As for the situation in the area directly north of Trondheim, there has been no change. Anglo-French Allied forces can still be resupplied from the coast. Although the German forces along the coast and on the eastern railway line have made contact, due to the Anglo-French allied fleet still controlling the Skagerrak and Kattegat straits, few German transport ships are able to reach their destination. According to the current situation, the Anglo-French Allied forces in the north may retreat to the positions directly north of Trondheim to concentrate their forces, but this move has not been fully decided. Even if they do, it will be temporary, because the Anglo-French Allied forces on warships will never give up their initiative (Havas, 27th).

Norwegian Terrain, Difficult to Fight In

Stockholm, Sweden – Swedish journalist Hedquist published an article in "Dagens Nyheter" yesterday, discussing the current war situation. He believes that Norwegian military resistance to Germany is largely futile because the difficulty of fighting in Europe has not been seen as in Norway. Only 2.5% of the land is arable. Twenty-four percent is forest, and the rest is barren mountains and wildlands, with crisscrossing mountains. Furthermore, all Norwegian cities with a population of more than 10,000, except for Tromsø in the north, are in German hands. There are thirty cities with a population of more than 5,000, and 23 of them have been occupied by German forces. Therefore, the journalist believes that further military resistance is futile (Haitong News Agency, 27th).

A Temporary Setback, Unrelated to the Overall Situation

London – The news that British forces in southern Norway need to make a limited retreat has not caused great concern among British newspapers. It is said that in large-scale warfare, temporary setbacks have no bearing on the final outcome of the war. The war in Norway is currently in its initial stages. The German forces' sudden invasion has gained them some military advantages, so we must prepare to deal with difficult military situations (Reuters, 27th).

German Troops Arriving in Norway Uninterrupted

Stockholm, Sweden – Local newspapers estimate that about 3,000 German soldiers are transported from bases in Denmark to Norway every day, transported by sea, land, and air, mostly gathered in the Oslo area. It is reported that the German side uses special small ships for transporting troops at sea (Reuters, 27th).

German Air Force Clearly Has the Upper Hand

London – Regarding the situation of the war in Norway, according to reliable sources, Allied forces have made significant progress in their advance towards Trondheim and have occupied the important stronghold of Støren. The German forces have occupied an important railway line in the Östersund area, seeking to establish contact with Trondheim. As a result, the Allied forces in the Lillehammer area have been forced to retreat under pressure. Military observers say that the number of Allied troops is far less than that of the German forces, and it is not easy to defeat the German forces. If the German forces can consolidate their positions in Trondheim, the Allied forces will face even greater difficulties and may have to temporarily focus all their efforts on the war in northern Norway. Furthermore, according to the communiqué issued by the British War Office, it can be seen that Allied forces north of Steinkjer have also retreated due to strong German pressure. There is currently no fighting in the area, only patrols are active. In short, what the Allied forces lack is high-speed fighter jets and anti-aircraft artillery to resist the German air force. Also, the lack of suitable air bases for the air force in Norway is a major shortcoming (Havas, 26th).

### British Aircraft Bomb Stavanger Airport Again; Oil Pools Near Moss Hit and Ignite; Several German Transport Ships Sunk

London – Reuters learned from responsible sources that during a large-scale raid by the British Air Force on Thursday night, they bombed the Stavanger airfield again, and attacked oil pools and refineries a few miles north of Moss. Several German supply ships in the bay near Stavanger, and ten German large supply ships in the Oslofjord, were all bombed. Due to poor visibility, the results of the air raid could not be fully known, but a 5,000-ton giant ship was definitely directly hit, and the refinery in Vallo was indeed on fire. According to a pilot, the entire area was ablaze when British aircraft flew away. On Thursday afternoon, a large bomb exploded less than ten yards from the starboard bow of a German transport ship in Granvinfjord. The wharf in the bay was also hit. A German supply ship in another bay was attacked by British aircraft, and the ship heeled over and partially sank. On the way back, British aircraft shot down a German Dornier seaplane (Reuters, 27th).

### The Pope Receives the US President's Special Envoy

Vatican City – The Pope received Roosevelt's special envoy, Myron Taylor, and had discussions (Haitong News Agency, 27th).

### Norwegian High Command Encourages Troops to Persist in Resistance and Seek Final Victory

Helsinki – The Norwegian High Command recently issued a letter to all soldiers in the country, stating: "You have done everything possible to stop the enemy from advancing. Although you have been forced to retreat and painfully abandon your homeland, this is a long-term plan and not a last resort. Now the period of retreat has ended. We hope that you will stand firm in your positions and continue to unite. Then victory will be certain." (Havas, 26th).

### Sweden Has New Determination to Defend Independence and Freedom; National Parade to be Held on May Day; German Request for Military Transit Denied

Stockholm, Sweden – Swedish political groups will jointly issue an appeal yesterday, reiterating Sweden's determination to strictly adhere to neutrality, and have scheduled a national neutrality parade on May 1st, also to show Sweden's determination to defend its freedom and independence (Haitong News Agency, 27th).

Paris – Sweden's attitude is now receiving special attention from French political figures. However, it is believed that the many German ships full of soldiers, lighting fires in the ports along the Baltic Sea coast, are probably not being used to attack Sweden, but are actually heading to Norway for reinforcements. Germany requested last week that Swedish authorities allow German military supplies to be transported through Sweden to Norway, although this was rejected. However, German medical rescue teams still passed through Sweden, and 200 wounded soldiers were transported back to Germany via Sweden. In addition, German sailors previously detained by Swedish authorities have been released after being proven to be ordinary merchant sailors. All of these points prove that Germany is interpreting international law in the broadest sense and is trying to gain as much benefit as possible from Sweden within its permitted scope. In reality, Sweden's supply of needed goods has been cut off since the outbreak of the war in Norway, and its situation is indeed very difficult. Therefore, it has had to conduct business negotiations with Germany and the Soviet Union. A Swedish delegation recently arrived in Berlin, and German economic experts will also travel to Stockholm. In addition, business negotiations between Sweden and the Soviet Union will also begin in the shortest possible time (Havas, 26th).

### Romanian Prime Minister Reaffirms Strict Adherence to Neutrality

Bucharest – The Romanian Ministry of Interior announced yesterday that the government has decided to prohibit the distribution of printed materials concerning the policies of the belligerent countries, regardless of whether they are printed in Romania or abroad. The purpose is to strictly maintain Romania's policy of neutrality (Haitong News Agency, 27th).

Rome – Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu met with a reporter from the Italian newspaper "Il Messaggero" and declared that "If the economic conference in the Balkans and the Danube can achieve satisfactory results, it will depend on Italy's attitude." (Haitong News Agency, 27th).

London – According to radio news from the capital of Yugoslavia, Bulgarian newspapers recently expressed Bulgaria's and Yugoslavia's determination to defend their neutrality against threats from all sides. One newspaper said that the world must know the heroic spirit of the Bulgarian and Yugoslav people. They will not tolerate any damage to their neutrality or sovereignty, and will not succumb to any pressure from Berlin, Moscow, London, or Paris (Reuters, 27th).

Capital of Yugoslavia – The "Politika" newspaper published a statement by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković, saying that Yugoslavia will firmly and consistently adhere to its policy of neutrality and independence, and the Yugoslav government is attempting to maintain a neutral attitude within the scope of economic relations (Reuters, 27th).

### Spanish Dignitaries Visit Rome

Rome – Spanish Undersecretary of Commerce and Industry Rogas arrived in Rome yesterday with several senior officials from the ministry (Haitong News Agency, 27th).

### German-Soviet Relations Gradually Showing Signs of Cooling; As Can Be Seen from the Tone of German Newspapers

Amsterdam – The tone of German newspapers has revealed signs that German-Soviet relations are cooling. Nazi newspapers have recently stopped hoping that the Soviet Union will provide further assistance to Hitler. The "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" and other newspapers have mentioned the various difficulties encountered by the Soviet Union in operating the Ural oil fields. It is reported that German firms have complained a lot about the slow delivery of goods from the Soviet Union. It is rumored in the Ruhr region that the Soviet Union is unwilling to hire German technicians to reorganize its production and transportation (Reuters, 27th).

London – Germany has denied the claim that German-Soviet freight transport has been suspended. However, German radio news today acknowledged that in the first three months of this year, the Soviet Union's rail transport of goods to Germany has been hampered by technical difficulties (Reuters, 27th).

### Soviet Policy Towards the Balkans Will Enter a New Stage; Rapprochement with Yugoslavia; Soviet Envoy to Bulgaria Suddenly Recalled Home

Capital of Yugoslavia – The "Dnevnik" newspaper reported yesterday that the Soviet Union's Balkan policy will have a new development from June 1st. It is expected that Soviet-Yugoslav negotiations can be concluded at that time, establishing an economic agreement. After the conclusion of diplomatic negotiations, the Soviet Union's Balkan policy will enter a new stage. According to the "Krir" newspaper, the economic agreement that Yugoslavia will sign with the Soviet Union stipulates that Yugoslavia will purchase 6,000 tons of Soviet cotton annually and sell 60 million meters of cotton yarn to the Soviet Union annually (Haitong News Agency, 27th).

Sofia – Soviet Minister to Bulgaria, Nalen Youff, and the country's army attache, Colonel Benediktov, were suddenly recalled home yesterday. The two immediately returned to Moscow by plane yesterday. The motive is unknown and has aroused great attention in political circles here (Haitong News Agency, 27th).

### Britain and France Speed Up Restoration of Free Trade Policy; Guarantees Have Been Made to the United States

Washington – The U.S. Department of State announced yesterday that Britain and France have assured the United States that they will restore free trade policies and multilateral world trade based on the principles of reducing trade barriers as soon as possible. This assurance is the result of several days of discussions between the British and French economic envoys in the United States and the State Department, because the American people oppose Britain and France's new blockade policy, especially the British and French blockade of German exports to the United States. Britain and France have also assured the United States that they will reconsider the applications of the American people to import German goods, and said that this restriction on trade is a wartime necessity and purely a temporary measure (United Press, 27th).

### Guatemala Sends Note to Britain Demanding Return of Ceded Territory

Mexico City – The Guatemalan government sent a note to the British government on April 24th, refusing to submit the request for the return of British Honduras to an arbitration court. The contents were only recently revealed. The British Embassy in Guatemala replied to the Guatemalan government's request on April 15th, refuting Guatemala's reasons for invoking the 1859 agreement and demanding the return of British Honduras. As a result, the Guatemalan government filed a reply, stating that Guatemala ceded the territory that is now British Honduras to Britain based on the 1859 agreement. For eighty years, Britain has not fulfilled the "compensation clause" in the agreement, so Guatemala is forced to abandon the agreement and demand that Britain return British Honduras (Haitong News Agency, 27th).

### Bulgaria Trains Young Men

Sofia – The Bulgarian government issued a notice yesterday, ordering all men of military age in the country to receive 60 days of special military training (Haitong News Agency, 27th).

### Fierce Battles Continue on the Chaojie Highway; Chinese Troops Capture Longxiang Village and Attack Fuyang

Shantou Correspondence: In early April, the Japanese side sent reinforcements to Chaoshan, including the Chida unit, the Shimomura unit, and Northeast puppet troops, numbering about five to six thousand, gathered in Chaoan, Anbu, Chenghai city, three strongholds, and along the Chaoshan Railway line. Recently, they advanced along the Anjie Highway to attack Yujiao, Jieyang. They were ambushed by the Chinese army on the banks of the Guoxi River. The Japanese army then turned its military front northward and on the 12th, went straight to Linjiapo, Guxiang. At the same time, the army and air force massively invaded the upper reaches of the Han River, crossing Po Jiling, and bombing Hulu City, 36 Heights, Shaxitou, Gouxia Village, and other places. They were all fiercely attacked and annihilated by the Chinese army and people. On the 13th, they retreated to the strongholds on the outskirts of Chaoan City, and changed to blindly bombarding from artillery positions on Dajian Peak, Wenli Mountain, Yunti Mountain, and Bijia Mountain. They also sent planes to fly low and drop bombs in Chaojie, Fengrao, and other places, destroying many villages and houses. The people in various places were aroused by righteous indignation and joined the National Army Corps and guerrilla detachments to launch night attacks on the Japanese rear strongholds. Yunbu City, Jiange, and Yinhu were attacked simultaneously on the night of the 12th. On the 14th, the army again sent 2,000 reinforcements from Shantou to Chaoan. On the morning of the 15th, more than 700 people, mixed with cavalry and artillery, broke through the Chinese army's control line southwest of Fengxi (both sides of Guoxi River), and attacked Daling and Longxiang Village south of Anjie Road. Fierce battles broke out again. The Japanese cavalry launched four attacks on the Chinese army. After a day of fierce fighting, they were finally defeated by the Chinese army and fled to Xucuo Township. The Chinese army pursued them, and the Japanese army abandoned horses and artillery and fled in a panic. The Chinese army pursued past Xixiang, Fengxi, and took advantage of the victory to send troops south, attacking Fuyang Gezhou in the sixth district. On the morning of the 16th, the two armies fought fiercely on the shores of Bailian Lake. The Japanese artillery on Qingma Mountain fired to assist in the battle. The Chinese guerrillas detoured Jinshi, bypassed Wuyang, and attacked the rear of the Japanese army on Qingma Mountain. The main force on the front of Anjie Road crossed Bailian Lake and went straight to Fuyang Station. The rear route of the Japanese artillery on Qingma Mountain was cut off, and they could not support the battle. They fled in a panic. The Chinese army rushed to the hilltop, beheaded more than a hundred people, and seized four mountain cannons, and immediately recovered Qingma Mountain. The Japanese army sent reinforcements to defend Turtle Mountain. The Chinese army then lured the Japanese army to Sihuanggang and surrounded them for a fierce battle. After four hours of fierce fighting, they killed more than 200 Japanese soldiers. After the remaining Japanese troops were defeated and returned to Turtle Mountain, they held firm and dared not come out again. At present, there are no traces of the Japanese army south of Anjie Highway. Lin Wenxian, the magistrate of Jieyang County, led the elite troops of the county's National Army Corps and joined the first regiment of the reserve division of the artillery city, holding Taoshan Tagang, Xigang, Xiapu Mountain, and Dahuangkeng. Shaxitou controls the entire Sangpu Mountains, looking down on Caitang, Huamei, Anbu, and Pengzhou, echoing the Chenghai guerrillas, specializing in night attacks on villages along the Chaoshan Railway.

The Japanese police commander stationed in Anbu, Horino, convened a joint township meeting in Guanlu Township on the 12th, called the "Pacification Conference." The puppet maintenance chairmen and puppet township chiefs from various places were present, about 40 puppets from places such as Guanchao, Dazhai, and Bietou. They decided on (1) adopting a joint township system, re-compiling household registrations and organizing baojia to prevent plainclothes teams from mixing in and responding to guerrilla warfare; (2) each puppet township chief was given three days to find ways to lure the escaped young men back to their hometown to resume farming; (3) appointing Chen Dianchen, the puppet chairman of Bietou, as the chairman of the joint township association, responsible for organizing the joint township White Guard team to eliminate plainclothes teams within the territory. The conference closed on the 13th. When the puppets returned to their hometowns, Horino sent puppet soldiers to protect them back. The puppet township chiefs took the opportunity to compile doorplates and conscript young men, and ordered each clan chief to hand over their sons and nephews who had left home. If they were not handed over within three days, they would have to pay a fine. They also forced the villagers to pay money in the name of "pacification." After hearing this news, the young men who participated in guerrilla work were deeply angered and decided to first attack their hometowns and eradicate the puppet township chiefs to relieve the people from their suffering.

### Huaming Power Plant in Jiangyin Has Been Occupied by the Japanese; Craftsmen Have Been Sent to Repair It

Jiangyin Correspondence: The former Huaming Electric Light Company outside Beiwai Gate West supplied electricity to the entire county. When the war broke out, some of the houses were destroyed. After the occupation, the Japanese army had no electricity, so they used two diesel engines from the Hongchang Cloth Factory in Zhongjie and the Xinkang Cloth Factory in Nancheng to start generating electricity for military use. The streets and alleys in the city are still as dark as pitch. The other day, the Japanese company Shin Kichi Electric Power Company specially sent a large number of craftsmen to repair the power plant machinery in order to generate electricity.

### Overseas Chinese Schools in Thailand Almost Completely Closed; Learning Chinese Has Also Become a Problem

(Bangkok Airmail News) Overseas Chinese education in Thailand has suffered a devastating blow since last autumn. Whether in Bangkok or in the inland areas, nine out of ten schools have been closed. Some Chinese schools in the inland areas are still勉力(endeavoring) to operate in accordance with the regulations of the Thai Ministry of Education, but as a result, they have been forced to close down. The Tao Ying School in 萬倫埠 (Wan Lun Bu) and the chance to nurture virtue have been cut off for unwarranted reasons. The fate of Chinese schools in other small ports can be predicted.

呵叻 (Korta) is an important city in northeastern Thailand. The number of overseas Chinese living here is second to none except for Bangkok. The public Chinese school, Tongwen School, there also shares the same fate as other Chinese schools and was closed on April 15th.

The Rose School in Bangkok, founded by the French, has had quite good results in the past. After the closure of Xinmin, Huanghun, and Yumin Chinese schools last year, the school, being run by Westerners, was able to teach Chinese as a foreign language according to the education regulations. Most of the overseas Chinese students who were still of compulsory education age went to study at the school, and the number of students increased from more than 300 to more than 700. Finally, due to the limitations of the school building and regulations, it was unable to accommodate as many overseas Chinese students as possible. Recently, the school authorities, citing the sharp increase in the number of students and the fact that the school was originally divided into male and female departments with school buildings far apart, although the school administration was unified, the management felt difficult, so they planned to submit a request to the Ministry of Education during this summer vacation to separate the male and female departments and make them independent. The Ministry of Education has accepted the submission, but the school will stop teaching Chinese and replace it with English when school resumes after the summer vacation. As a result, more than 700 overseas Chinese students have been deprived of the opportunity to learn their ancestral language.

As for the soft foreign exchange and the decline in gold, only cotton yarn and cotton have become a trend of only rising, not falling, which is probably due to the筹碼 (chips) relationship. In the recent two days, the market has been pulled up by arbitrageurs.

The current yarn market opened in the morning with extraordinary popularity. Everyone was shouting to buy in. The initial price of 20-count Double Horse factory was 1,490 yuan, and then it jumped out of the customs price to 1,508 yuan. At this time, buyers surged like a tide, and it rose directly to 1,538 yuan. It slightly fell in the middle, falling to 1,518 yuan. By the time of closing, it rose again to 1,535 yuan.

Wenzhou 60 Mainland 50

Statistics 1,745

### Indian Cotton Transactions Are Lively

The Hua-Japanese factory procurement is still sluggish. The current cotton transaction situation is listed on the left:

Xing Heng 244.0 148.00 Same industry entered 200 pieces

Da Zhongji 256.00 also 206 pieces

Yesterday, Dapeng Fugui fine cloth and fine twill each rose by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per bolt. Ewo group cloth rose by 7.5 jiao. Lun Chang Ewo bleached and dyed cloth was cheaper than the market price due to flat sales. The most traded cloth this season were those for May delivery, totaling over 100,000 bolts. Customer sales lacked bulk orders. Demand from Yunnan and Guangdong merchants was better.

The Dong cloth market continued to be strong. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 46.25 yuan per bolt in the morning. Afterwards, due to the rise in yarn prices, although actual sales were not smooth, the hoarding sentiment inside and outside the industry was still strong. Therefore, the Dragon Head spot stock order at closing was opened at 46.4 yuan. Next month's futures rose to 48.5 yuan. Four Gentlemen serge increased to 1.435 yuan per yard. Next month's futures were 1.51 yuan.

Cloth exports: 200 pieces were shipped to Xiamen on the 28th, 445 pieces to Hong Kong, 318 pieces to Tianjin, and 250 pieces to Yantai.

### Food: Rice Market Remains Stable

The rice market, after turning higher on the morning of the previous day and then softening again in the afternoon, showed a weaker trend at the opening yesterday morning and finally declined. This is because the rise in price was entirely due to speculative sentiment, with no real foundation, making it easy to fluctuate. Moreover, short covering is not constant and actual sales are weak. Such a market is known to be forced, and lacks lasting power. Therefore, those holding goods took advantage of this opportunity to sell their profitable goods. However, buyers remained on the sidelines, unwilling to accept the offer, making it difficult for the market to sustain itself, and it soon turned bearish. The prices of various foreign rice varieties fell by varying degrees of 6-7 jiao. For example, Little Twisted opened at 41.7-41.8 yuan. Afterwards, some local shops slightly increased their intake in preparation for the Sunday holiday, and the weak trend began to subside slightly, gradually becoming range-bound. Although there was a period of volatility in the middle, it was entirely due to speculative sentiment, and a reversal was expected. As a result, the closing price was about half a yuan lower than the previous day, with No. 1 Saigon at 46 yuan. Mixed broken rice and green beans remained stable due to similar supply and demand.

Over 2,000 bags of japonica and glutinous domestic rice arrived. Sales were relatively active because prices were lower than foreign rice. However, traders were reluctant to buy because they feared that the weather would cause the rice to spoil. Therefore, the market did not fluctuate. However, older stock was weaker, with prices falling by 3-5 jiao. In the market, Changxi aged japonica was selling for only 40 yuan, or 39.5 yuan; Nangang early rice was 39.5 yuan or 39 yuan; glutinous rice was similar; Li Dan fresh yuan rice was selling for about 38-39 yuan, while soft and damp old rice was only 35-36 yuan.

Foreign rice soared the day before yesterday, appearing to be on the verge of another price spike. However, after the market opened yesterday, actual sales were deterred by the high prices and merchants were unable to continue buying. Furthermore, Dumai rice continued to arrive following foreign rice, with Japanese merchants especially eager to sell at lower prices. And with the financial situation extremely tight, most of those with floating profits were eager to sell. Although major firms and large households were still trying to hold on, the market was ultimately suppressed by the unloading of goods by floating holders. Prices for all grades of foreign rice fell by 4-5 jiao compared to the previous day. However, hoarders still bought back futures for closing, and original brokers also bought back. Apart from a batch of low-priced goods transacted the day before yesterday, no further orders were placed. Therefore, No. 2 West Real for April and May was still priced at 93.5 yuan, and the original settlement price was 53 yuan. Total transactions for the day were over 200 tons, and spot volume was about 6,000 bags.

### Flour and Wheat: Stand-Off

Flour: Spot flour trading was sluggish yesterday. Due to prolonged stagnation in export sales and the impact of domestic flour dumping on small-scale retail sales in the city, the intake of flour has decreased. The total number of bags directly sold by the factory was only about 5,000 bags. The price for No. 2 flour from the factory was still 13.8 yuan, and the same grade of old car brand was slightly lower by 1 jiao. But due to the standoff between buyers and sellers, no transactions were completed. It was also reported that the price of domestic flour in Changxi was 13.2-13.3 yuan, and 1,000-3,000 bags were transacted, all of which were handled by merchants in the city.

Wheat: Trading was stagnant again yesterday. This is because the source of supply has been lacking for a long time, and stocks have long been depleted. Old wheat has already passed its peak season, and new wheat is about to enter the market. Although the harvest is still some time away, wheat seedlings are growing very rapidly, and a bumper wheat harvest is expected this year. The factory intends to suppress wheat prices at this time, while holders are still thinking of defending their position. As a result, there were no transactions. It was also reported that the delivery of goods to the factory was also quiet due to the weekend.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Hover

Securities gray market: The market was extremely stable yesterday. The bulls wanted to push the market up, but were limited by their lack of strength. The bears wanted to push the market down, but felt that there was no flow of spot goods. High-interest loans were incompatible with the interest income from public bonds themselves, and lending was bound to be rejected by those who had spot goods, as it was unfavorable to the bulls. Therefore, most of the purchases in the market were for short covering, and the sales were for bulls who were unwilling to be pressured by high interest rates and sold their holdings. There were very few new transactions, and the market was therefore in a hovering pattern, which was not easy to break out of for the time being. Yesterday, there were only a handful of buyers and sellers, mostly Hongda and Yitai buying, and Tongkang, Jiufeng, and No. 20 selling. Transactions were even scarcer in the afternoon, with a total transaction volume of just over 500,000. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading: Five shares of Chunghwa Book Company were traded at a price of 31.5 yuan.

The 30th annual shareholders' meeting of the English commercial firm, Inada Oak Company, general manager of the local Exchange Bank, will be held in Shanghai on May 10. The final dividend for 1939 is proposed to be 6 jiao in national currency, for a total of 1 yuan including the interim dividend.

London, 26th (Friday): The listed prices of notes continued to rise. The listed prices of the Maccali Bank shares continued to rise by 3 shillings and 9 pence, to 9 pounds, 8 shillings, and 9 pence. The Kola Kelin Rubber shares rose by 4.5 pence, to 18 shillings and 6 pence. The rest remained unchanged. London, 26th (Friday): The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable today. There were no changes in any of the bonds on the upper and lower tiers.

### Sugar Market: Domestic Sugar Tight

Yesterday, domestic sugar showed a tight trend. Xinghua merchants offered dozens of bags of Xinghua medium white at 70 yuan, dozens of bags of superior blue at 53.5 yuan, and 70 cases of sliced blue at 46 yuan. Guangdu merchants offered 60 cases of Shimen sliced blue at 43 yuan, and 100 bags of Dongxiang red at 44.1 yuan. For Jiang merchants' Gao Diao blue, the broker was still offering 52.5 yuan, which has not yet been settled with the Association. The spot market for 24 coarse white sugar continued to soften slightly. New goods from foreign warehouses were 63 yuan to 62.95 yuan. Tai Koo Car White B Mark West Warehouse rose 8 jiao to 72.6 yuan, old goods were 72.35 yuan to 72.45 yuan. H Mark Car Red was 50.8 yuan, up 2 jiao. Dutch Red was 53.7 yuan, down 1 jiao.

### Dried and Fresh Goods: Golden Needles; Guangdong and Fujian Merchants Purchase; Market Prices Rise by 2-3 Yuan

The recent active sales of golden needles have caused prices to rebound, with market prices rising by 2-3 yuan. Merchants from Guangdong and other regions have been purchasing in recent days. Yesterday's market prices were: Top Zhuang vegetables at 50 yuan, Daxing vegetables at 48 yuan, Yanghua vegetables at 46 yuan, Xiang Zhuang vegetables at 44 yuan, Xuzhou vegetables at 36 yuan, and Zhongxing vegetables at 42-40 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: Japanese Rayon Arrives in Shanghai

896 bales of rayon, shipped from Hong Kong by the Tai Koo Company's Qiongzhou Wheel, arrived in Shanghai the evening before yesterday. It is said that the rayon is from the East.

### Imports and Exports: Both Local and Foreign Goods Exported and Imported

Imports yesterday (27th): 1,450 bags of soda ash from the United States, 5,000 pieces of Little White Play, 149 boxes of sulfuric acid, 2,232 bags of steel powder, and 764 rolls of paper from Italy.

Exports today (28th): 1,500 bags of flour and 1,170 bags of soybeans shipped to Xiamen, 2,755 bags to Hong Kong, 2,500 pieces of soybean cake shipped to Xiamen, 420 bags of raw kernels and 200 tins of raw oil shipped to Hong Kong, 470 tins of father shipped to Xiamen, 200 bags of sugar shipped to Xiamen, 600 bags to Tianjin, 5,200 pieces of tea shipped to Tianjin, 380 pieces to Yantai, 130 pieces to Xiamen, and 24 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Woolens: Discussing the Western-style Clothing Accessories Concurrently Operated by the Woolen Industry

In Shanghai, in addition to specializing in the sale of woolens, most woolen businesses also deal in various accessories, such as feather yarn, interlinings, foreign cloth, buttons, silk yarn, thread, lining goods, dyes, gold trim, sleeve and hat bands, fire white plaid, brushstrokes (i.e., new Western-style clothing samples), white foreign tape, hangers, irons, scissors, soft and hard rulers, etc. These accessories are entirely sold to Western-style clothing tailors. The total number of imports over the years has also been considerable. In recent years, Western-style clothing has become popular, and the number of men's and women's clothing stores has increased, so sales have also gradually expanded. In the past three to five years, woolen businesses, in addition to feather yarn, foreign cloth, horse mane satin, French-style lining, and black-gray lining, have generally stopped dealing in other accessories, because those who specialize in this include Yuanchang Xinghua Foreign, Zhang Xiangtai Zhang Weitai, Dechang, and Dachang, etc.

In the year after the Shanghai War, the population of the Isolated Island was concentrated, and commerce was abnormally prosperous. Woolens and accessories were actively priced. Yuanchang Xing and Huayang each set up a branch and used street vendors to promote sales, maintain customer relations, and extend credit, so that buyers were deeply impressed. Therefore, business under this system is the most developed for these two businesses, just like Chunhe Yong and Huaxin in the woolen industry are the leaders.

Western-style feather yarn comes in two types: plain and twill. Plain is popular in hot weather, and twill is popular in cold weather. Many Shanghai small machine households produce domestic products, which are also very popular throughout the four seasons, which is silk-gloss feather yarn. Because silk-gloss feather yarn is beautiful and inexpensive, sales of imported twill and plain feather yarn have sharply declined. Interlinings include French-style continued scolding lining, charcoal lining, soft lining, hard lining, pocket cloth lining, and pulp glue lining. Except for A277 French-style lining, very few foreign goods are currently arriving, and the market trading is entirely for domestic goods that are out of stock. Foreign cloth includes patterned foreign cloth and plain gray foreign cloth. Only patterned foreign cloth is currently selling well. Western goods were long ago defeated by Eastern goods and are rarely imported. And Eastern goods have recently been replaced by domestic factory goods, and sales have decreased by two-thirds. The most famous brand among thread goods is Hongsheng. Buttons and buckles, regardless of overcoats, raincoats, long gowns, socks, vests, etc., were initially entirely Western goods from the United States, Britain, and Germany. Later, with the dumping of Japanese goods, Western goods imports gradually decreased. In recent years, domestic buttons have been of excellent quality, and Japanese goods imports have also decreased. Among silk threads, the most widely sold products recently are domestic factory goods, followed by Soviet products. Lining goods: In ancient times, feather silk, feather satin, feather Jin, and Western satin were popular, but they have now been eliminated. Horse mane satin currently circulating in the market is entirely domestic goods woven in this city. Dyes (i.e., face powder): domestic, French, and Japanese goods are all produced, but most cannot be sold. The English S brand is still the most famous, because S brand dyes are easy to create clear lines, have fewer thick edges, and are more durable than miscellaneous brand powders. Sales of gold trim and sleeve and hat trim are extremely small, mostly only from England and Japan. Large checkered and white checkered cloth are entirely domestic goods, with very few imported goods. Brushstrokes, regardless of size, are all newly shipped from England to Shanghai. Sales of white foreign cloth have declined greatly recently. Hangers were initially all shipped from foreign countries, but for the past ten years or so, they have been entirely made by Chinese. English ironing knives and scissors are the best quality and also more expensive, followed by domestic goods. English leather belts and soft rulers are better, but recently Chinese have also been weaving them, but users say that they are easy to shrink and fade, so sales are not as good as imported goods. The sales trends of imported and domestic rulers are similar, but special-shaped rulers are still more actively sold from abroad. Short-shaped city rulers are widely sold domestically.

### Han Li Si Woolens Sell Well

Han Li Si woolens sold well yesterday, and prices rose. British-made No. 1 sold for 23-24 yuan, No. 2 for 17-18 yuan, and single-width genuine goods for 14-15 yuan. Tianjin-made Ren Li Tianma Tu, checkered per yard, sold for 15 yuan, plain color for 13 yuan. Shanghai-woven British-made Ewo brand sold for 10.05 yuan, Japanese-made Gongda brand No. 1 for 14.5 yuan, No. 2 for 13 yuan. White, gray, and blue were all in high demand, because men's and women's colored overcoats are all the rage.

### After Meeting with Central Government Officials, French Ambassador Arrives in Shanghai Today; Expressed Strong Sympathy for China in Chongqing; This Trip to Shanghai is Purely for Personal Matters

French Ambassador to China, Cosme, is in Shanghai to deal with private affairs and to escape the summer heat. On the 19th of this month, he flew from Chongqing to Hong Kong, and then came to Shanghai on the French Postal Steamship Company's Flex L'Sonny wheel. The local French Embassy received telegrams from the Ambassador from Hong Kong, both the day before yesterday and yesterday morning, reporting the dates. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 10:00 AM today and will dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf.

French People Sympathize with the War of Resistance

On the afternoon of November 10th last year, the French Ambassador left Shanghai on the Java Company's Chibard ship for Hong Kong to negotiate issues related to Vietnamese transportation. He then flew to Hanoi to meet with Vietnamese Governor-General Jia Shijilun, and then took the滇越 railway to Chongqing, arriving at noon on the 22nd. He paid respects to the central authorities and attended banquets held by the Foreign Affairs Association and the Sino-French-Belgian-Swiss Cultural Association. At the Sino-French-Belgian-Swiss Cultural Association, the Ambassador stated, "France has always expressed sympathy for China. Every French person expresses the utmost admiration for China's great past and limitless future. These are heartfelt words. China's spirit of resistance, the struggle of the Chinese nation, and the heroism of the Chinese army are even more admirable." During the dinner, the French Ambassador generously donated 2,000 French francs to be used as the Association's expenses.

Paying Respects to Chairman Chiang

The Ambassador met with British Ambassador Cole, American Ambassador Johnson, and Soviet Ambassador 姚友新 in Chongqing. People in Chongqing considered it rare to have the ambassadors of four countries in one place during China's War of Resistance. Among them, the French Ambassador was the first to arrive in Chongqing. It was previously rumored that the French Ambassador had requested Yunnan's neutrality from Chongqing officials, but this statement was entirely unfounded and the Ambassador absolutely denied it. The Ambassador's wife flew from Hanoi to Chongqing by 中舫 plane on December 9th of last year. During his stay in Chongqing, Mr. Cosme paid respects to Chairman Chiang on December 3rd of last year.

Visiting Vietnam Once to Treat Dental Issues

The Ambassador went to Hanoi on March 29th to treat dental problems. After treatment, he flew back to Chongqing from Hanoi at 3:30 PM on the 10th of this month. The Ambassador is now going to Hong Kong on the 19th of this month to deal with private affairs in Shanghai and to escape the summer heat, taking the French Postal Steamship Company's Flex L'Sonny to Shanghai.

Consul General Paul Discharged from Hospital the Day Before Yesterday

Also, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from French sources that French Consul General Paul, due to illness, has been recovering at a certain hospital for quite some time. All embassy affairs have been handled by Ms. Archie. Now that the French Ambassador will return to Shanghai today, Consul General Paul was discharged from the hospital the day before yesterday afternoon. It is rumored that after meeting with Ambassador Cosme, Mr. Paul will leave Shanghai for a short trip, and then return to his country.

### Important Resolutions of the Price Stabilization Committee: Continuing to Purchase Foreign Rice; Agreement Signed to Purchase 60,000 Bags; Striving to Reach 1 Million Yuan in Donations

Since its establishment, the Municipal Price Stabilization Committee has handled price stabilization three times, benefiting the common people to a great extent. In order to handle the fourth price stabilization matter, the committee specially convened its fifth plenary committee meeting at the Shipping Club on Guangjia Road yesterday afternoon.

Mr. Yu Qiaqing's Opening Remarks

Mr. Yu Qiaqing gave the opening speech as chairman. He said, "Today, our association is holding its fifth plenary committee meeting. Everyone has taken the trouble to attend, demonstrating your sincere enthusiasm for caring about the welfare of the public, which is truly gratifying. Since the fourth plenary committee meeting resolved to continue handling price stabilization, at the eighth standing committee meeting on April 13, the committee members present recognized a total of more than 300,000 yuan on the spot. However, it is still more than 600,000 yuan short of the original target of 1 million yuan. Of course, we still need to work hard to raise the shortfall in order to achieve the original intention of stabilizing the community and maintaining the people's food supply. I believe everyone is clear-sighted and understands the overall situation. You must know that providing relief to the people's food supply in Shanghai is one of the most important undertakings to protect the entire community. If this goal is relaxed, I fear that social turmoil will arise, or even shake the entire city's order and security, which would be worse than theft. These are not deliberately alarmist words, but are concerns that must be prevented. I hope you will do your best to raise the remaining 600,000 yuan to maintain this undertaking. Saving others is saving yourself, and the poor and needy are our compatriots. I hope you will understand the above foolish intentions and not dismiss them as groundless worries."

Unanimously Passed: Continuing to Pledge Donations

After Mr. Yu's speech, the discussion on the price stabilization issue began. As a result, the following was resolved: (1) Unanimously passed to continue pledging donations, and each industry will do its best to handle it, striving to achieve the goal of 1 million yuan; (2) Continuing to order 60,000 bags of crushed rice; (3) As soon as the call for deposits is completed and the donations are collected to a considerable amount, the price stabilization will be started on a regular basis. It is learned that, in order to expedite the process, the association will entrust foreign firms to send a telegram to Saigon to order 60,000 bags of broken rice. The negotiations are still in progress, and the fixed date for tribute rice price stabilization will be soon. Millions of civilians are eagerly awaiting its immediate implementation to relieve their immediate needs.

### US High Commissioner to the Philippines Left for Japan Last Night; Dr. Lu Accompanied

US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, and his wife, accompanied by Naval Attaché Major MacVan, left for Japan on the President Pierce Wheel at 11:30 PM last night. The President Pierce Wheel was originally scheduled to arrive in 比 on the morning of the 26th, but due to the strong winds encountered on the way to Shanghai, it was delayed until 4:30 PM this afternoon. The arrival time in Shanghai differed by nine hours. Mr. Sayre and his party left the Customs Wharf on the Jianghai Customs 塢麗 small wheel at 10:00 PM yesterday. US Consul General 美赫德 Admiral, Colonel Baker, and all friends in Shanghai went to the dock to see them off. It is expected that Mr. Sayre will arrive in Tokyo by the end of the month. Ambassador Ger is preparing to welcome everything. Dr. Monroe, a famous American educator who arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, was also on the same ship as Mr. Sayre. It is said that Mr. Monroe does not intend to land during this trip to Japan and will return directly to the United States.

### The Da Mei Bao Printing House Was Suddenly Attacked Yesterday Morning; Hand Grenades Were Thrown, But the Damage Was Minor; All the Deceased Thugs Who Resisted Arrest Escaped

The Da Mei Printing House at No. 19, Avenue Edward VII, French Concession (the printing house for the English "Da Mei Evening News", the Chinese "Da Mei Evening News," and the "Da Mei Bao") was suddenly attacked by thugs at 5:05 AM yesterday morning, while the "Da Mei Bao" was being printed. One person resisted arrest and died on the spot. Three workers in the machine room were injured by shrapnel from the hand grenades thrown by the thugs. At the time, patrol officers and thugs engaged in a fierce battle, exchanging fire for ten minutes. Stray bullets injured one passerby and one vendor, both dressed in Western clothing. The thugs eventually escaped. When the thugs' car sped away on Beijing Road, it ran over and killed one pedestrian. Fortunately, the "Da Mei Bao's" printing press was not damaged, and the "Da Mei Bao" currently being printed was published as usual. Details are as follows:

Daybreak Robbery

The thugs who attacked the Da Mei Printing House had hired car No. 18429 of the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company's Jiaozhou Road branch at the predetermined location at 3:05 AM yesterday morning. A Mr. Zhang, driver No. 9, drove the car. The thugs instructed him to drive to the Jin Situ Temple on Connaught Road. When the car arrived, the thugs inside suddenly pulled out Mauser pistols, threatening the driver to get out. He was taken by another thug to a nearby back alley and imprisoned. Four thugs who were waiting there boarded the car and drove straight to the back door of the Da Mei Printing House on Rue du Consulat.

Sneaking In and Throwing Grenades

The thugs' car arrived at the back door of the Da Mei Printing House at 5:05 AM yesterday morning. Four thugs immediately got out of the car. There was usually a French Concession armored car and one Vietnamese constable stationed there. To avoid attracting attention, one of the thugs, pretending to be a newspaper buyer, started chatting with the Vietnamese constable, as they had arranged previously. The Vietnamese constable, suspecting nothing, allowed the other three to sneak in. Upon reaching the door of the machine room, the thugs immediately threw two hand grenades at the "Da Mei Bao" printing press, which was in operation. There was a loud explosion in an instant, and the windows and doors of nearby buildings were shattered. The thugs threw one grenade at the English "Da Mei Evening News" press, but it did not explode. At that time, the "Da Mei Bao" was being printed, and fortunately, only the belt was damaged, not the press. Therefore, after minor repairs, it continued to be published, only delayed by nearly three hours compared to usual.

Resisting Arrest and Fighting

After the hand grenades exploded, the thugs immediately rushed out, jumped back into the original car, and fled south. At this time, an armored car and several Chinese and Western detectives, who were usually stationed in front of the Da Mei Bao, had heard the explosion and arrived at the scene. They fired at the thugs' car with submachine guns and rifles. The thugs fired back while speeding south on Avenue de la Mission, then turning east onto the Bund. When the thugs' car reached the Bund on Avenue Edward VII, the armored car and the Chinese and Western detectives fired intensively at it. The sounds of machine guns, pistols, and rifles mixed together. The detectives were unable to chase the car on foot, and the thugs escaped. As the thugs fled, they also released smoke bombs for cover. The two sides engaged in a fierce battle for ten minutes. It is unknown whether any of the thugs were injured in the car. However, it is known that as the car sped westward on Beijing Road, it ran over and killed a pedestrian because it was driving too fast and without regard for anything.

Vietnamese Constable Killed

When the thugs threw hand grenades at the printing house, the imposter posing as a news vendor who remained outside the printing house and was talking to Vietnamese constable No. 34 (Phan Van Phul), 24 years old, responded by pulling out a pistol from his sleeve. He went around to the back of the car and, catching the Vietnamese constable off guard, shot him in the head. The Vietnamese constable, unprepared, died on the spot. When the bomb thrown at the Da Mei Bao printing press exploded, the workers in the machine room were unable to escape in time. Feng Zhengqing (34 years old, from Changzhou) was injured in the right foot. Zhou Yonglai (22 years old, from Yangzhou) a worker in the typesetting room, was injured in the left leg. Li Longgen (26 years old, from Pudong) was injured in the head. In addition, Wu Linsheng, a street vendor selling wontons at the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Sichuan Road, was grazed in the face by a bullet. The above four were not seriously injured, so they were sent to Renji Hospital by the Public Concession ambulance and discharged after a short dressing. The body of the Vietnamese constable who died was sent to the small mortuary on Route Tenant de la Tour by the French Concession police. The funeral is scheduled for 3:00 PM next Monday. A pedestrian named Chen Zhenqing (20 years old, from Beiping, wearing Western clothing) was injured by a stray bullet on the French Concession Bund. He went to Guangci Hospital for treatment afterwards. His injuries are said to be minor.

Police Attention

After the incident, the No. 18429 Xiang Sheng car hired by the thugs was found by the Public Concession Jing'an Temple police at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning. The tires had been punctured by bullets. Mr. Zhang, the driver, had also been released by the thugs and reported the robbery to the police. The authorities in both concessions attached great importance to this case. The key members of the French police personally investigated the matter. When the thugs escaped, one hand grenade was left behind on Rue du Consulat and has been taken away by the French police for inspection.

### Land-Air Joint Transport Between Xi'an and Chongqing; The Whole Journey Takes Three Days and is Very Convenient

In order to facilitate passenger transport, the Ministry of Communications has decided to jointly manage land-air transport by the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, the Longhai Railway, and the Northwest Highway Bureau. Passengers depart from Xi'an by train every Tuesday to Baoji. This section is 173 kilometers long, and the journey takes six hours. The ordinary third-class ticket price is 3.22 yuan, the second class is doubled, and the first class is double that. Passengers taking special express trains must pay an express surcharge, which is calculated at 0.15 yuan per person for third class, 0.30 yuan for second class, and 0.60 yuan for first class for every 100 kilometers traveled. After arriving in Baoji, they stay overnight. On Wednesday, they take the Northwest Highway bus to Hanzhong, costing 18.30 yuan in national currency, and arrive on the same day. On Thursday, they take the Eurasia Aviation Corporation plane from Hanzhong to Chongqing, costing 370 yuan in national currency. The whole journey takes three days, which is much more convenient than going by land via Chengdu to Chongqing. Travelers from Chongqing heading north-west can take the first bus of the Northwest Highway Bureau to Baoji after arriving in Hanzhong by plane (no registration is required for purchasing tickets), and then take the train to Xi'an. The above method has been implemented since last month, and all travelers have praised its convenience.

### No Definite Date for the Establishment of the Special Police Force; Donations and Taxes are in a Stalemate; Rumors that Xiao An is Trying to Control All Donations and Taxes; On Gambling Dens, He Claims "Gradual Elimination"

Since the Public Works Department signed an "Agreement" with the puppet "Municipal Government" in February regarding the issue of extending roads beyond the settlement boundaries, the organization of the special police force has been discussed by the Chief Inspector of the Public Works Department, Bowen, and the Chief of the puppet "Police Bureau," Lu Yang, at weekly meetings. So far, the results of the past meetings are that Bowen has stated successively on the 23rd and 25th that "the negotiations between the two sides have reached a harmonious level" and that "some significant progress can be expected in the middle of next month." Therefore, there is a widespread rumor that the "special police" will be established in the middle of next month. The puppet side told Western reporters yesterday about the situation as follows:

Establishment Date

It is said that the "special police" issue for extending roads beyond the settlement boundaries has indeed made significant progress since the previous negotiations between the two sides. Therefore, it is predicted that the organization may be established by the middle of next month at the latest. This is the same as what the Chief Inspector of the Public Works Department, Bowen, stated. The establishment date has not yet been confirmed by either side. The two sides are still negotiating on the establishment of "special police" stations and the appointment of "special police" personnel. Currently, the puppet "Police Bureau" Chief Lu Ying is in Nanjing to attend the so-called "Celebration of Returning to the Ministry." The decision will be made after the two sides meet again after his return to Shanghai.

Puppet Side's Attempt to Control Donations and Taxes

It is rumored that Xiao An stated that the issue of collecting donations and taxes in the area where roads are extended beyond the settlement boundaries is indeed an important key in the negotiations between the two sides. However, this issue is planned to be negotiated only after the "special police" are established. In the past few years, donations and taxes in the area where roads are extended beyond the settlement boundaries have been collected by the Public Works Department. However, in the past few months, the puppet "Municipal Government" has also forcibly collected a part. Therefore, when reporters asked whether donations and taxes would still be collected separately by the two sides in the future, Xiao An resolutely stated that the collection of donations would be entirely under the control of the puppet side. The tax revenue would be entirely controlled by the "Special Police Bureau" to be used as funds for the establishment of the "Special Police Force" and for the operation of the area where roads are extended beyond the settlement boundaries. Neither the Public Concession nor the puppet "Municipal Government" want to interfere with this income.

No Determination to Eliminate Gambling Dens

It is said that gambling dens in the area where roads are extended beyond the settlement boundaries will be forced to close completely after the "special police" are established. However, the steps taken will be to "gradually eliminate" them. Therefore, it will take several months before the gambling dens in the area where roads are extended beyond the settlement boundaries can be completely eliminated. Finally, Xiao An said, "Although he has not made the customary visit to the new Chief of the Public Works Department, he believes that the relationship between the puppet side and the Public Works Department is still very harmonious." Finally, he boasted that his relationship with the consuls-general of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France in Shanghai was also very close.

### Ninth Installment of Principal and Interest on the Unified Public Bonds; Payments to be Made in July; Lottery for Ding and Wu Type Bonds Scheduled

The five types of bonds (Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, Wu) of the Unified Public Bonds of the Republic of China, 25th year, total 146 million yuan. The remaining amount from the customs duties, after deducting reparations and foreign debts, will be used for the principal and interest payments of these public bonds. The lottery for the 9th installment of principal repayment has been held by the National Debt Fund Management Committee in five phases starting in February. Now, except for the Jia, Yi, and Bing bonds, which have already been drawn, the Ding bonds are scheduled to be drawn on May 10th, and the Wu bonds are scheduled to be drawn on June 10th. The total amount of drawn bonds and due interest is 56,019,700 yuan, which will be paid by the Central Bank and its authorized Bank of China and Bank of Communications starting on July 31st. Since the Ministry of Finance temporarily suspended the payment of petty interest due to the interception of customs duties in the occupied areas, the four banks, the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications and Farmers Bank, have discounted payments to maintain creditworthiness. The payment methods will be announced by the Ministry at that time.

### Inter-Port Trade Between Shanghai and the Mainland; Products Are in Great Demand; Exchange Rates are Extremely High

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, most factories in the mainland have ceased operations. Shanghai, due to its concession status, has been able to maintain a semblance of normalcy. Factories can continue to operate as usual, and products are sold at good prices because the mainland needs them and supply and demand are abnormal. Recently, due to the impact of the European war and exchange rate contraction, the mainland's demand for Shanghai products has become even more urgent. According to statistics obtained by the customs (this number is not usually released by the customs), the value of goods shipped from Shanghai to various domestic ports in March of this year was 47,571,180 yuan, mostly to the southwest and southern parts of the country. The value of goods purchased by Shanghai from various domestic locations was 28,979,617 yuan, resulting in a surplus of 18 million yuan. In the first quarter of this year, the value of goods exported from Shanghai to domestic ports was 151,841,835 yuan, and the value of goods shipped to Shanghai from other ports was 75,688,938 yuan, resulting in a surplus of 76 million yuan. Due to the balance of payments between ports, there is a high demand for remittances from other ports to Shanghai, so the exchange rate of Shanghai currency in other ports is quite high.

### U.S. Fleet Gathered on the Shanghai Shore; American Residents Celebrate Mother's Day Early Today; American Families Entertain Naval Personnel

American residents in Shanghai will celebrate Mother's Day today. More than 50 American families will host lunch for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps personnel. Traditionally, Mother's Day is celebrated on the second Sunday of May each year, which falls on May 12th this year. However, the Shanghai Naval YMCA chose to hold it early today to take advantage of the gathering of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet in Shanghai. Currently, the U.S. Asiatic Fleet stationed in Shanghai includes the flagship Augusta, as well as the gunboats Guam and Luzon, the submarine tender Canopus, the destroyer Lansdale, and six submarines. Therefore, U.S. Navy service personnel are gathered on the Shanghai shore.

Participation from Various Countries; It is reported that more than 200 people will attend the banquet today, making it a grand Mother's Day event. For the past 21 years, the Shanghai Naval YMCA has invited American families or families friendly to the United States to host lunch for U.S. Navy service personnel every Mother's Day. In addition to American families, families from countries such as Britain and Norway also participate. Mother's Day was initiated in 1904 by Professor Hilling of Indiana, USA. Each family participating in the banquet hosts two to seven Navy service personnel.

Reception Program; The U.S. Navy is scheduled to gather at the Naval YMCA on Sichuan Road at 10:30 AM today and be transported by Mack trucks to the social hall on Route Petain for worship. The U.S. Marine Corps will also finish worship at the Grand Theater at 11:30 AM and then proceed to the social hall to meet their Navy brothers. Then, they will all gather in the social hall plaza, where the YMCA staff will introduce them to the host families. They will be assigned to various homes for lunch. After lunch, the hosts will invite the guests to play games, watch movies, or drive to the Hongqiao area for a drive. It is also reported that the Naval YMCA will have a special program on May 11th, the actual day of Mother's Day.

### Chicago Daily News Reporter Steele Passes Through Shanghai

Steele, the main Far East correspondent for the Chicago Daily News, and his wife, after traveling in Chongqing, went to Hong Kong to board a ship directly to the United States. Unexpectedly, the ship was temporarily delayed, so they switched to the President Pierce to return to the United States via Shanghai and Japan. Thus, they unexpectedly passed through Shanghai the night before last, staying for one night. Mr. and Mrs. Steele will still come to China in a few days.

### British Ships Retain Original Status After Being Requisitioned; French Ships Sail as Usual; Only One French Ship on the Far East Line is Requisitioned; The British Government Does Not Interfere with the Business of British Ships; The Norwegian Ships Have Been Released and Have Sailed from Hong Kong to Shanghai

Since the outbreak of the war in Europe, British and French ships have been completely under the command of the Navy Department. Their schedules and routes are strictly kept secret. Therefore, British and French ships cannot move freely during navigation and must obey orders at any time. At the beginning of this month, the German army suddenly attacked Denmark and Norway, which made the European situation even more tense and serious. The British army also landed in Norway, and the French army and navy followed. Due to transportation needs, the French company's postal ship Athos, which runs on the Far East route, was requisitioned for military transport.

Only One French Ship Requisitioned; It was rumored in Shanghai a few days ago that French ships would be suspended. It has now been learned that only the Athos has been requisitioned among the French ships running on the Far East route. It is said that the others are sailing as usual. Therefore, one of the company's ships departed from Marseille last month (26th) and sailed to the Far East. Another ship will also depart from Marseille in the middle of next month. The first Norwegian ship to come to Shanghai after the resumption of navigation was the Talisman (translator's note), managed by the Da Xiang Yang Company, which arrived in Shanghai at about 4:00 PM yesterday. The Teitania is expected to arrive in Shanghai on Monday. The Prosper, managed by Dong Huiji, is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of the month and will sail from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the first of next month.

British Ships Do Not Leave the Far East for the Time Being; The merchant ships of the British Jardine Matheson and Taikoo Steam Navigation Companies, which operate on the coast of China, have been requisitioned by the British government for war purposes. However, they are still operating as usual in various ports. It is reported that the order to requisition ships will be implemented from the first of next month. In addition to the above two companies, other merchant ships operated by British merchants will also be requisitioned soon. According to the regulations on requisition, there will be no major changes, which is not as severe as rumored outside. According to senior officials of the two companies, the change is only nominal. In fact, the requisitioned ships will not leave the Far East. According to the British authorities, there are two methods for these ships: (1) All ships operated by British merchants are managed by the Navy Department and are subject to dispatch to the war zone to serve; (2) Technically, they are managed by the military authorities, but they are allowed to operate as usual.

Loading of Passengers and Cargo Remains the Same; The above two methods were recently ordered by the government. This means that although the ships are under the management of the government, the personnel and shipping affairs are still arranged by the companies themselves. Whether it is passengers or cargo, everything remains the same. The decision will be made based on the future political or military developments in Europe and Asia. It is very likely that the company's ships will stop operating due to being requisitioned for military purposes in the future. It is reported that there are more than 60 ships requisitioned. The two small ships of Jardine Matheson, the Lih Ho and Fook Ho, were requisitioned for military purposes last month and are currently serving in the Hong Kong and Singapore area.

Norwegian Cargo Ships Return to Shanghai One After Another; The Mainland Daily News reported that the Norwegian cargo ships in the Far East waters had been ordered by the British naval authorities to go to Hong Kong, but have now been released and have resumed navigation, and are allowed to load cargo to Shanghai. Those expected to arrive soon include the Norwegian oil tankers Basilea and Storsted, leased by Mobil Oil Company. The Basilea weighs 5,761 tons and was originally scheduled to arrive here on the 23rd of this month, but was detained in Hong Kong for several days, so it has been postponed to the 28th to come to Shanghai and will berth at the Pudong Mobil Wharf. The Norwegian cargo ship Talisman arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 27th. When the Scandinavian war broke out, the ship secretly left Manila and sailed to Shanghai. It arrived at the outer anchorage of Wusong on the 14th of this month, but was seized by a British naval officer and escorted to Hong Kong, detained for several days, and finally allowed to return here. The Norwegian ship Prosper, leased by Jebsen & Co., sailed from Saigon, was detained once, and then released. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 28th.

Increased Wages for Loading and Unloading Cargo; The cargo handling workers at the Roosevelt Wharf, a U.S. company, have been hired by the American Labor Union. Recently, due to soaring prices and difficult living conditions, the wharf cargo handling workers have requested the company to allow them to increase the cargo handling wages from the customers. It is now known that the company has decided after discussion that it is true that life is difficult at a time of high prices. The original prices have been changed. The list of cargo names and cargo handling wages for each item has been listed and finalized. The new prices are two to three percent higher than before and have been sent to various shipping companies for notification and will be implemented from this month.

The Chichaglijka Arrives in Shanghai Today; The new mail ship Chichaglijka of the Java Company will arrive in Shanghai this time. According to the schedule, it will arrive in port on Monday (29th) of next week. It is now learned that the ship can arrive in Shanghai early this morning at 9:00 AM and berth at the Pootung Blue Funnel Wharf. There are 498 passengers. At about 10:00 AM, they will take a small boat prepared by the company to disembark at the New Customs Wharf. The mail ship will stay in Shanghai for two days and leave Shanghai for Xiamen on the 2nd of next month, passing through various ports in Hong Kong and Nanyang and returning to the mooring waters. The French mail ship Felix Roussel is expected to arrive in Shanghai at about 10:00 AM this morning and berth at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. It is said that a large batch of foreign rice was loaded from Saigon.

### 50 Million Aluminum Subsidiary Coins; Half One-Fen and Half Five-Fen, Totaling 1.5 Million Yuan

After the Shanghai Banking Association submitted an application to the Ministry of Finance to issue aluminum subsidiary coins of one-fen and five-fen, the Bank Joint Reserve Committee, the Money Trade Joint Reserve, and the British Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation have distributed them to their member banks and money shops for circulation in the market. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency inquired about this from the Banking Association yesterday. The aluminum was entrusted to the American Arctic Company for casting. According to the contract, the total amount is 50 million coins, half one-fen and half five-fen, totaling 1.5 million yuan in national currency. The first batch of 10 million coins and the second batch of 7 million coins have been issued successively. The third batch of about 10 million coins is expected to arrive in Shanghai early next week and will be distributed by the Banking Association to the silver and money trade reserve warehouses and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation for distribution to various banks and money shops. If industries need aluminum coins, they can apply to their respective banks and money shops for a reasonable amount. There will be no more casting after this, and it will be determined based on market needs. Since the issuance of aluminum coins, the shortage of subsidiary coins in the Shanghai market has been alleviated, and citizens have generally praised its convenience.

### Fuzhou Sojourners in Shanghai Concerned About the Rice Shortage in Their Hometown

The Sanshan Guild Hall Holds a Meeting and Decides to Console Wang Meihui

The Sanshan Guild Hall on Fuzhou Road is a group of Fujianese from Min. A board meeting was convened yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. The chairman reported that the guild hall had repeatedly received letters and telegrams from the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce reporting the urgent need for rice relief in their hometown. In addition to the 1,973 bags of foreign rice that had been loaded onto the Shenyou ship last time, this ship, the Shenfu, was also allocated 1,730 bags of foreign rice transshipped from Hanjiang to the province to relieve the food shortage in their hometown. The meeting discussed and approved this, in addition to donating all the customs refund of the Shenfu ship, they would actively purchase more to relieve the food shortage and stabilize rice prices. Chen Runnan proposed that Wang Meihui, the chairman of the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce, has always been enthusiastic about local relief and disaster relief in their hometown. During this rice shortage, she has been working hard to seek relief and raising funds to come to Shanghai to assist in the purchase of rice to be transported to Min to provide food for the people and benefit the Rong territory, which is not a small feat. Reading the newspaper recently, there are many misunderstandings. Should they send a letter of condolence for discussion? Wu Hongshi, Huang Yu, Lai Gangshen, and Ximi's source of relief said that due to inconvenient transportation, the local supply has been abnormal and insufficient. They should send a letter to Wang Meihui, the chairman of the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce, to express their condolences and express their deep respect for this rice transport disaster relief, and ask her to continue to do her best to maintain relief for their hometown, and not to be discouraged by public opinion. The motion was passed, and the draft letter was handed over to the secretariat.

### No Headway in Running Trolleys in Hongkou District

Impossible to Resume Next Month

Trolley routes 9, 8, and 1, and trackless trolley routes 21, 18, and 17 in the Hongkou district were suspended due to the special circumstances and difficulties in the area. Since the procedures for entering and leaving the area changed, the trolley company had sent representatives to contact the other side several times to discuss the possibility of resuming the trolley lines in the Hongkou area. It was also rumored that the above routes would be restored on May 1st. To clarify the truth, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency specifically interviewed the person in charge of the company yesterday to inquire about the resumption date and preparations for the Hongkou district trolley routes. According to the person in charge, although there had been several contacts to prepare for the resumption of trolley service in the Hongkou district, the negotiations had failed to make any headway, so the resumption of trolley service currently seems difficult.

### Commanders of Various Countries in Shanghai Return Visits to French Commander; French Honor Guard Presents Salutes

The Shanghai Times reported that Colonel Xiang Pei, commander of the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteer Corps, Major General Simmons, commander of the British forces in Shanghai, Rear Admiral Grassford, commander of the British Yangtze Patrol Fleet, and Major Molante, commander of the Italian San Marco Marine Corps in Shanghai, visited Colonel Essoutier, the new commander of the French forces in Shanghai, at the French military headquarters on Avenue Albert on the morning of the 26th. From early morning, a French honor guard was stationed in the headquarters parade ground. When each commander arrived with his adjutant, they presented arms and saluted. Each commander was guided by Major Fleurendre, a French staff officer, to meet Colonel Essoutier. After exchanging pleasantries, they inspected the honor guard to the tune of music played by the French military band, and then took their leave.

### The Japanese Economic Blockade Policy Has Been Broken Through: Spring Native Goods Exports Increase Sharply, Although the Coast is Blockaded, a New International Route is Opened, Native Goods Exports This Spring Double Compared to Last Year

After the export waterways of China's coastal areas were blockaded by Japanese warships, the export routes for various native products shifted with the development of the war. For example, tea and tung oil, in the early stages of the war of resistance, were mostly transported to Guangzhou via the Yuehan Railway, and then concentrated for export through the port. Later, due to the fall of Guangzhou, they were gradually transported to Beihai, Haikou, and other places, and exported through the port. Later, due to the Japanese blockade extending to the southern ports, Chinese native products changed course again to another international route in the southwest for export. The current export volume is not only not less than it was then, but has actually increased a lot. Taking the first quarter of this year as an example, the value of exported goods was 39,742,500 yuan, while in the same quarter last year it was 19,396,300 yuan, and in the same quarter of the year before last it was 13,416,200 yuan. Comparing these figures, the first quarter of this year increased by more than one time compared to last year, and by about two times compared to the year before last. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese dream of imposing an economic blockade on China has ultimately become a bubble. The value of native goods exported in the first quarter of this year was the highest for textiles and fibers, totaling 64,688,062 yuan.

### The Sorrowful Sounds of the People of Chaozhou City

The prefectures and counties of Chaozhou, since the Han and Tang dynasties, have been known for their customs and civilization, and were once called the "Lu of Zou" and the place where Changli passed through and transformed, and the area where Meishan preserved its spirit. However, due to the many mountains and swamps and the production of *zhe* and oranges, the yearly cultivation is insufficient for four months of food for the entire prefecture, which has a population of 100,000. Usually, food is mostly reliant on imports by sea. When scarcity occurs, it depends entirely on begging. Since last year, when the national army retreated from Chaozhou and Shantou, Chenghai successively fell. Alas, many of our people followed the army to relocate. However, those who fled the smoke of war lacked land to cultivate, and those who took refuge in the mountains and valleys suffered from miasma. Because they were not acclimatized, they could not find a place to live. Suffering from famine, how could they survive the year? Therefore, some reluctantly turned around and returned to their old homes, which is understandable and cannot be said to be abandoning it without patriotism. Recently, I received news from home that in the city, even rats and sparrows were being dug up and nothing was left. The grass and trees had been stripped bare. Matches were used as kindling, and even the matchsticks were being sold. Rough rice was relied upon to fill hunger, but each yuan could only buy ten *liang*. Searching for horse manure to wash and preserve the remaining grains to moisten the intestines. Many swallowed vegetable roots, accumulated frost and cold, and their feet swelled. Or their livers and gallbladders were burning, not knowing if they would live to see the next day. Or they stumbled on the road and died. There were even those who were driven by hunger and desperation and threw themselves into the river together, or those who, with their hearts burning with hunger, drank poison as a whole family. Alas, how tragic! Chaozhou is not a rice-producing area. Historically, the seaport was blocked, and there was suspicion of aiding the enemy if interior grain entered. Those who begged for food elsewhere in the hope of avoiding imminent death were labeled as spies. From then on, all hope for food was lost, and they died in this city of futility. The flames of war frightened them at night, and there was no hope for regeneration. When Yangcheng Li did not come to kill the horse to provide for the general, he heard that Zifan only had a good plan to save his own body. The heavens and earth wept, and the gods and ghosts were grieved. Remembering the past and present, iron and stone shed tears. I beg that the refugees at sea were still assisted by the Chinese and foreign. But the starving dead in Chaozhou has no benevolence and righteousness to paddle. Pity us in this remote area, originally the territory of the country. Why do the people in this place not have the descendants of Yixuan? Especially because the place involves the border and the news is scarce, and people are despised and abandoned. Calls are unheard, so the national authorities rarely take care of it, and benevolent people feel like they are abandoned. Comrades hear bad news from their hometown and have no tears to shed. Listening to the dying groans, their hearts are broken. Recently, fellow villagers in Shanghai, even though they have exhausted their meager efforts, are still only providing a drop in the bucket. Alas, this clothing customs and fear of this resistance and the other hindrance, even if the money is gathered, the skills of universal giving is scarce. All day long, running around, eagerly hoping that the people with disheveled hair and loose caps who are roaming around the room are waiting for friends who are willing to do what is right, thinking that charity has no national boundaries and is lacking in the sympathy of benevolent people. There are originally many righteous people in Lingnan, and I hope the National Government will also consider it so that a drop of sweet dew can save these lives and be like obtaining a soul return. I beg that people of good deeds at home and abroad will take pity on the Chaozhou refugees in Shanghai. Wenqi Announcement. The expense is from donations of good people.

### Chinese Detective of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, Lu Gengsheng, Shot Dead: Ambushed by Thugs on Chengdu Road, Died of Serious Injuries from Four Gunshots, One Assailant Escaped in the Crowded City

Lu Gengsheng, a Chinese detective at the Jing'an Temple Police Station in Shanghai, was 43 years old, from Nanjing. He had been with the police force for nearly 20 years, solving major cases and rising to his current position. When he was a deputy detective, he served in the police stations of Gordon Road, Huishan Road, and Laozha. After the August 13th Incident, he was transferred from the Laozha Police Station to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, where he has been for more than two years. His family lives on Nanyang Road. Yesterday afternoon at about 5:30 PM, Lu walked out from his mistress's place at a certain address on Chengdu Road and Dagu Road. Before he had taken a few steps, an assailant wearing a dark Western suit ambushed him from the side of the road. Seeing Lu Gengsheng approaching, without asking any questions, he drew his gun and fired six or seven shots, hitting Lu in the chest, abdomen, and other parts of his body with four bullets. Lu fell to the ground, bleeding profusely and barely breathing. At this time, a nearby street patrol officer heard the shots and rushed to pursue the assailant, firing one shot, but unfortunately missed. Because the area was very busy with many pedestrians and vehicles, the assailant escaped without a trace. The Chengdu Road Police Station was nearby. Soon after, a police car arrived and surrounded the area, but the assailant had disappeared. They inspected the scene and collected several discarded bullet casings left by the assailant for investigation, while also pursuing the killer. The injured Lu Gengsheng was taken to the Shanhai Pass Road Patrol Police Hospital by ambulance. Despite treatment, he died in the hospital at 6:30 PM.

### Chen Zhaoxi Sentenced for Adultery

Chen Zhaoxi (also known as Cai Shou), the owner of the Minyi Embroidery Company at No. 44, Lane 847, Tiantong Road, previously married a graduate of Guangxia Middle School, Miss Zai, and received much financial assistance from her. Chen had also borrowed 5,500 yuan from Miss Zai. Recently, Chen suddenly claimed that his shipping business had suffered too many losses and that he had to temporarily leave to avoid being pursued by creditors. Miss Zai believed him and returned to her mother's home in Ningbo. Unexpectedly, Miss Zai recently received a secret report stating that Chen was committing adultery with another woman at the Minyi Company. She hired lawyer Wu Linkun to report to the Huizha Police Station, who ordered detective Xu Huanqing to arrest them. Chen and another woman, Jin Suhua, were indeed arrested. After investigation, it was learned that Jin was originally Chen's first wife. After Chen met Miss Zai, knowing that Zai had some savings, he falsely divorced Jin and married Miss Zai in order to obtain her financial assistance. Now, he deliberately created a ruse to achieve his goal of reuniting with Jin. The police lawyer Peng Qiqi legally sued him in the First Special District Court. Because Chen and Jin failed to appear in court, the court issued a warrant for their arrest. Later, it was reported that Chen Yi had been arrested and sent to the Special Court. Miss Zai, represented by lawyer Wu Linkun, filed a civil suit, requesting the court to order Chen to pay 5,000 yuan in damages. This case was heard yesterday by Judge Zhan Liangce, who sentenced Chen to five months of imprisonment for adultery. If he chooses to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it would be at the rate of three yuan per day. He was also ordered to pay Wang Man 2,000 yuan in damages.

### Portuguese Youth, Righteous Man Kefeng, Bravely Saves a Chinese Child Drowning in the River

According to the *North-China Daily News*, at about 3 PM on the 26th, a seven-year-old Chinese child was playing with two other children by the river near Quessant Road and Zhao Le Road when he accidentally fell into the river. At that time, the tide was rising, and the child was quickly swept into the middle of the river. Fortunately, Mr. Gong Safu, an 18-year-old Portuguese youth residing at No. 294 Yuyuan Road, was passing by. Hearing the child's cries for help, he rushed to the riverbank.

### After the Death of Cheng Haitao, Mother-in-law and Daughter-in-law Face Each Other in Court, the Daughter-in-law Sues Her Father-in-law for Performing the Property Division Contract, the Father-in-law Sues the Daughter-in-law on Behalf of His Grandson for Concealing Inheritance

The late Chief Inspector of the Political Department of the French Concession Police Force, Cheng Haitao, was assassinated on the morning of October 18th last year while going to the police station from his home to work. He left behind his elderly father, Cheng Changsheng (former Detective No. 6 of the French Police Force), his middle-aged widow, Liu (28 years old, from Jiangwan), and two sons, Wanli and Qianli, from his previous wife Shen. After mediation by relatives and friends, Cheng's estate was estimated.

Estate estimate

The estate was divided equally between the two sons and the stepmother Liu, and Liu moved out to live separately. All of Liu's dowry remained with her. The two sons, Wanli and Qianli, were cared for by Cheng's father, Cheng Fusheng. Both parties signed a property division agreement, which was certified by lawyer Jin Yu. Now, Cheng Liu has moved out to No. 38 Hengmaoli, Baxianqiao, to live separately, but because her father-in-law refuses to pay the share.

Analysis contract

She has been unable to receive the property. After several unsuccessful attempts to have someone mediate, Cheng Liu hired lawyer Fang Gang to file a petition with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court against her father-in-law, Cheng Fusheng, to perform the contract. The court accepted the petition, and yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Delin presided over the mediation at the Fourth Court. The opposing party, Cheng Fusheng, arrived at the court with lawyer Peng Qixiu, but did not report his appearance, so only the petitioner Cheng Liu and her lawyer were present to state

Reasons for the petition

After reviewing the case, the court announced that mediation was unsuccessful due to the absence of the opposing party and ordered that a formal lawsuit be filed. Cheng Fusheng, also in the capacity of legal representative, filed a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court on behalf of his grandsons Cheng Wanli and Cheng Qianli against Cheng Liu for concealing the inheritance of the deceased husband and disregarding the lives of the two grandsons and the frail elderly, requesting that she return the inheritance. The court will be hearing the case soon.

### Drug Trafficking Nets Three Criminals Who Await Sentencing After Interrogation

Dai Heshang, from Jiangbei, was engaged in the business of selling morphine. He set up a drug trafficking den in Hongyunfang, Kai'erzi Road. Dai used Yang Chunlin, nicknamed "Little Yang", a former police officer who had been dismissed from his job, as his lookout. He also employed Zhang Zhenbao, an unemployed young man, to specialize in sales. Daily business was no less than several tens of yuan. The matter was detected by the police. On the previous day, Zhang was arrested and 35 packets of morphine and 7 yuan in cash were confiscated. He was taken to the police station and confessed that Dai Heshang and Yang Chunlin were the masterminds. They were arrested at their addresses. After investigation, they were escorted to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday afternoon, where Judge Liao presided over the interrogation. Dai and Yang's testimonies were evasive. Zhang Zhenbao confessed to selling morphine. After reviewing the testimonies, the court announced the end of the debate and set the sentencing for the 30th.

### The Zhengyi Club Sues for Relocation, Demands a 300% Rent Increase, the Defendant Counterclaims Based on the Contract

The premises of the Zhengyi Club on the sixth floor of the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road were originally leased from the Continental Bank. The original rent was 780 yuan, which was later reduced to 400 yuan per month for a five-year term. The ownership of the premises has now been transferred from the Continental Bank to the Hadong Foreign Firm. The foreign firm has notified all tenants that the rent must be increased by 30%, while the rent increase for the Zhengyi Club must be increased to 300%, i.e., the monthly rent would be changed from 400 yuan to 1,600 yuan. Because the Zhengyi Club refused, the Hadong Foreign Firm sued the Zhengyi Club for relocation to the First Special Court on the grounds that the lease had expired. The Zhengyi Club, represented by lawyer Zou Yu, stated that according to the lease, the defendant had the right of first refusal, and that the defendant had made tens of thousands of dollars of renovations to the premises, and that the Hadong Foreign Firm's rent increase notice to other tenants was 30%, while the rent increase for the defendant was 300%, which was obviously unreasonable. Therefore, it filed a counterclaim, requesting that the rent be increased by 21% in accordance with the lease. Yesterday, Judge Wang Qufei held a hearing on the case. The defendant Zhengyi Club stated that if there was a possibility of settlement, the Zhengyi Club was willing to increase the rent to 800 yuan, but because the Hadong Foreign Firm still did not agree, the hearing proceeded. Judge Wang then ordered the defendant to pay the counterclaim litigation fee and adjourned the hearing.

### Unmarried Couple Involved in Litigation, Yu Yushan Acquitted

Yu Yushan, a local resident, met Xie Lianping, the daughter of Xie Zhuangdou from Anhui, last year. At first, they only exchanged visits, but then entered a stage of love. In February of this year, they held an engagement ceremony at the Jiaobao D饭店. However, after the engagement, Yu suddenly discovered that Miss Xie had committed a disreputable incident, stealing a diamond ring and being arrested by the French police. Since Xie had this fact, Yu found it difficult to spend his life with her. He hired lawyer Tu Kunfan to file a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court to terminate the engagement. Xie, also through her mother, Ms. Huang, filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Yu for interfering with the family, accusing Yu of enticing and committing adultery with her three times. She requested that he be punished in accordance with Articles 229 and 240 of the Criminal Law and filed a civil suit, demanding 50,000 yuan in damages. Yu still hired lawyer Tu Kunfan to defend him, denying that he had committed adultery with her and requesting a verdict of not guilty. This case has been concluded by the First Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Meng Tingke held a court session to announce the verdict: Yu Yushan was found not guilty, and the plaintiff's accompanying civil lawsuit was dismissed.

### Lawyer Sues for Public Fees, the Defendant Ordered to Repay the Full Amount

He Jingtian and Ding Ziying, shareholders and managers of the Zhengfeng Dongji Sugar Firm at No. 17, Yong'an Street, French Concession, filed a lawsuit last year against Mei Shaoxiong, the firm's business director in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, for breach of trust and embezzlement of more than 700,000 yuan in funds. The two parties were involved in litigation for many years. Until recently, the two parties reconciled amicably through mediation. Mao Xianshen, the lawyer representing He Jingtian et al., appeared in court for them in more than ten cases. The two parties agreed on a public fee of 8,900 yuan. After deducting the amount paid by He, 2,450 yuan was still owed. After lawyer Mao repeatedly demanded payment, He et al. ignored him. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court. Judge Li Liang once summoned the defendants for a hearing, but they did not appear. After one-sided debate, the case was scheduled for pronouncement yesterday. The main text said: He Jingtian et al. should transport and pay the plaintiff 2,400 yuan in national currency. The litigation fee will be borne by the defendants. (Huaguang Agency)

### Letter

Dear Editor, Having read the news in today's edition regarding Mrs. Yan Zhonghanfen (i.e., Yan Zhongshi) committing suicide by taking poison, it does not conform with the facts. Mrs. Yan Zhonghanfen is the eldest daughter-in-law of Yan Jiazhuo (i.e., Junshu). Since her husband, Yan Zhiqian, passed away in the spring of the 25th year of the Republic of China, she has been determined to maintain her chastity. Her father-in-law has not provided for her, and she was forced to take her daughter, Qingyi, and temporarily return to her mother's home. She once filed a lawsuit in Suzhou for maintenance. The case has gone through two trials and is currently in the third trial. In March of this year, Hanfen hired this lawyer as her legal advisor. Because the cost of living has been rising recently, it is difficult for the mother and daughter to maintain their livelihood. She entrusted this lawyer to send a letter to Mr. Yan Junshu requesting support and discussing a solution, but was rejected by letter. Hanfen, pressured by the environment, became ill with anger. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 26th of this month, she took medicine in an attempt to end her life. She is currently being treated in the hospital. We respectfully request that you correct the information to reflect the truth. We hope you will take this into consideration. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Dong Duanshi, April 27th.

The Monk Risked His Life to Solicit Donations (2)

After the two county officials inspected, they returned by sedan chair. At that time, those who believed in the monk secretly blamed the county officials for being meddlesome. In a short while, half of the people left, and half remained. However, there were still no less than several hundred people worshiping from the viewing platform, sitting on the side platform, and wiping away tears while seeing them off, all saying that ascension was imminent and that the opportunity was rare, all妄想to be Liu An's chickens and dogs. Unexpectedly, at noon on the 17th, there was a turning sound in the niche, and the crowd was quite surprised. Suddenly, there was a loud vibration, the niche door opened wide, and the living Buddha was truly alive. The men and women under the stage fled in shock, and his disciples were also speechless, looking up at the niche, seeing the old monk's feet had already stretched straight out of the niche, beckoning a disciple to help him down. His disciples were surprised that their master had not died and abandoned their previous efforts. The master blamed his disciples for not burning him and causing a change in the middle, and they resented each other. The constable on duty took out the handcuffs and arrested the master and disciples, and they rushed into the city to report to the officials for disposition. When the county official heard that the monk had come back to life, he couldn't help but laugh and immediately ordered the master and disciples to be questioned. The old monk first kowtowed and begged for forgiveness, claiming: "This poor monk is seventy-six years old. In order to donate to repair the temple foundation, there was no way to beg for donations, so I risked my life to accomplish a good deed. First, I borrowed the name of becoming a Buddha. Second, I borrowed it as a meeting to collect money. Third, I established a long-term career for my disciples. If my soul has knowledge, it will not be as hungry as Ruo Ao." As for the method of causing death, he obtained a strange pill, and after taking it, people would be unconscious, but they would still wake up after three days and nights. Therefore, on the 15th, he sat in the niche and took the medicine, and it was scheduled to be cremated on the 16th. After speaking, he kowtowed and wept. The county official, thinking that he was old and pitying his foolishness, and also seeing that he was actually starting a temple, which was different from those who were collecting money to fund illicit wealth, should not be convicted of deceiving people with heresy. Therefore, he was given a light sentence and no corporal punishment was added. Also, fearing that there were any untruths or omissions, he separated and investigated his disciples. The confessions were the same. After rebuking them, they were released together.

Children's Weekly

### How to Choose Games

— Wan

Children are all active and don't like to be quiet. They jump and run all day long without a moment to sit still. If they are quiet, it is either because they are feeling unwell, or they are always active all day long, especially on "Saturday and Sunday," when homes, whether small or large, become temporary playgrounds. When I am free, I often walk around the alleys and often see groups of children playing. What are they playing? Probably dribbling a ball, skipping rope, playing marbles, spinning tops, kicking a ball, and in early spring, flying kites, kicking shuttlecocks, etc., changing from time to time depending on gender, season, interest, and age. However, the problem is that they don't know how to choose, which games are beneficial to play, and which games are not.

In school, during physical education class, we have some time for games. Sometimes the teacher teaches new ones, and sometimes the students think of new ones themselves. Because there are many people, the objects to play with are limited, so the way of playing is different from what we do at home. Since games have such a close relationship with children, they must have considerable value. They can make the body move, help digestion, promote development, and in terms of character, they can cultivate a spirit of teamwork, cultivate habits of self-government and discipline, and at the same time make our thinking flexible and our actions agile. If we can choose properly, then it will enable us to develop in all aspects, otherwise, it will hinder our development. Now, let's give an example to prove the impact of bad games on the body.

There was a child who liked to play marbles very much. Every day after lunch, he would invite a few classmates to dig a few holes in the mud and start playing. Whoever hit the other's marbles would win one. Over time, it seemed to develop into gambling. If he won, he would laugh heartily, and if he lost, he would want to win it back. So he played every day, and his fingers and clothes were always covered in mud. He continued to play like this for a long time. Suddenly, one day, the child's stomach started to hurt, and it hurt very badly. His family was worried and sent him to the hospital. After the doctor examined him, he said that his appendix was inflamed. So he underwent surgery and suffered a lot of pain before recovering, but his body was much weaker than before.

After reading the above facts, we know that games must be chosen. Anything that has a gambling nature, a dangerous nature, or a tricky nature is not acceptable. The most important condition for our choice is that it is beneficial to us, such as being able to promote health, develop thinking, and cultivate good habits. Secondly, we focus on interest. Why do I say this? Because children used to only focus on interest and did not think about their bodies, so we must change our concept in the future.

Games are a right that children should enjoy, so children must make full use of them, choose appropriately, and enable us to obtain true value in games.

### Children and Labor Day

— Yang Chunlv

May 1st is International Labor Day.

The origin of Labor Day: In 1886, American workers, unwilling to suffer abuse and exploitation by capitalists, united to demand that of the 24 hours in a day, 8 hours be for work and 8 hours be for education. This reduction in working hours for workers would decrease the profits of capitalists, and they naturally refused. Therefore, on May 1st of that year, workers in Chicago, the industrial center of the United States, held a strike demonstration because their demands were not met, gathering more than 60,000 workers to march. They clashed with the police on the street, and many workers were shot and killed by the police, and the leaders were arrested. Among them, four were hanged.

However, this great sacrifice awakened workers around the world who were living a life of slavery. In 1889, the International Socialist Party, recognizing that the demands of the workers were justified and should not be subjected to such unreasonable oppression, convened a meeting of world labor organizations in Paris, France, and designated this day as "International Labor Day." The "Labor Law" also stipulated that workers should work eight hours a day, and capitalists should not arbitrarily extend workers' working hours. This was a victory won by the workers through their own struggle.

Chinese workers first celebrated this "May Day" in 1920. Although commemorative activities were held every year on this day, after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, many factories closed down or suspended operations, resulting in tens of thousands of unemployed workers, who were practically starving to death.

Now, "May Day" is about to pass before our eyes again. Dear children! You are all young workers of the revival of the Chinese nation. Hurry, work hard to seize your path to survival!

### Black Brothers (16)

— Mu

Geller hastily said, "Oh, how can you be so heartless?" The King of the Golden River, Wang Boran, said, "Heartless? They pour that unholy water into my river. How can I tolerate such disrespect?" Geller anxiously said, "How can it be unholy? I know they took it from the baptismal font in the chapel." The King of the Golden River became even more solemn and said, "That is true, but they were unwilling to use this water to save those who were about to die of thirst, humans and animals. Therefore, it is unholy. Even if it has been blessed by all the great saints, it cannot be considered holy water. Only that which comes from a compassionate thought is holy. Even if it has been soaked in corpses, it cannot defile it." On it hung three clear, transparent drops of dew. He dripped them into the water bottle in Geller's hand and then said, "You put this into the river and immediately rush down the other side of the mountain. You should then be able to get to Hundred Treasures Valley. Hurry up and go."

Having said this, his short figure suddenly became blurred, and his flesh-colored robe seemed to turn into a light white mist. He stood for a while, as if a rainbow ribbon had scattered. The color gradually faded, the mist rose into the air, and the King of the Golden River had vanished.

Geller stared blankly for a long time, feeling very disappointed. It turned out that he saw that the river water had not turned into gold, but it had decreased a little. However, he still obeyed the short king's words and climbed down the other side of the mountain, heading towards Hundred Treasures Valley. As he walked, he seemed to hear the sound of running water underground. When he saw Hundred Treasures Valley, he saw a river like the Golden River rushing out of a rock above, dividing into countless small streams, flowing over piles of dry red sand.

While Geller was looking around curiously, new grass grew by the new stream, vines climbed all over the moist soil, and small, delicate flowers bloomed one by one, very brightly colored. At this time, dusk was approaching, the stars filled the sky, and clumps of goosefoot and strands of ivy filled Hundred Treasures Valley with shadows. Thus, Hundred Treasures Valley was transformed into a paradise once more, and the property that had been lost due to cruelty was now restored due to benevolence.

Geller was still in Hundred Treasures Valley. Whenever poor people came to his door, they never returned empty-handed. His granaries were filled with grain, and his house was filled with treasures. This was just as the short king had promised him, and it had turned into the Golden River.

Even today, the residents of the valley always point out the place where the three drops of holy water fell, which is the source of the underground Golden River, leading directly to Hundred Treasures Valley. And in the rapids of the Golden River above, one can still see two black stones. When the setting sun is in the west, the flowing water always weeps there. Everyone calls these two black stones the Black Brothers. (The End) are filled with a strange feeling of boredom, especially the children, who like to go outdoors to play. Even if there are fun games in the house, they are generally unwilling to stay indoors to play. Moreover, these few days have been so warm, and the spring breeze seems to be massaging the face, making one feel exceptionally comfortable.

Today is Sunday again, and A'hui is naturally no exception. He doesn't want to hide at home, and wants his older brother to accompany him to Zhaofeng Park, not far from their home, to play. A'ming initially showed an unhappy expression, but later, for some reason, he became happy.

After finishing breakfast, the two of them got on a bus and arrived at their destination in no time. There were especially many tourists, because it was a holiday and the weather was warm. The tourists at the entrance kept coming, with the potential to fill up such a large park. The two brothers stepped into the entrance of the park and immediately saw a large expanse of lawn, already covered in tender green clothing, and piles of colorful flowers smiling at people, making one feel suddenly cheerful and exceptionally happy. They chose a quiet spot to rest for a while.

"Bang! Bang! Bang..." A sudden, ear-piercing gunshot struck A'hui's heart sharply.

"That's the sound of foreign soldiers practicing shooting." A'ming already knew that his younger brother was frightened, so he quickly comforted him. Hearing this, A'hui's tense emotions eased. He had thought that something unexpected had happened.

"The shooting range is very close to us here, it seems to be over there, otherwise it wouldn't be so loud." A'hui pointed in that direction, muttering to himself.

"Actually, it's not as close as you say, it's quite far away. Because our ears, upon hearing a gunshot, don't have the ability to determine its distance, but can clearly distinguish the direction from which the gunshot came. The direction you pointed just now wasn't bad. Sounds coming from the left or right are easiest to distinguish. If the sound occurs directly in front of us or behind us, it's not easy to identify its source. Because sounds emitted in front of us often travel from behind. Speaking of this, it reminds me of an interesting game—testing the source of sound." A'ming said, stopping there. A'hui naturally wanted his older brother to test him, but how could they test it in the park? So they decided to go back home to test it, and as a result, A'hui had no interest in sightseeing. The two of them circled the park once and then went back.

As soon as they got home, A'ming led his younger brother to the attic, tightly closing the doors and windows. He blindfolded A'hui with a towel, who thought his brother was joking with him, playing hide-and-seek. Who would be happy to play that? Then he told him to sit down and not move, not even to turn his head. A'ming found two pieces of hard board, placed them apart on the ground, spaced apart in front of and behind A'hui's head, and asked him to distinguish where the wooden boards were being knocked. He clearly pointed in the opposite direction to the actual direction, that is, the sound occurred on this side, but he pointed to that side. When he was allowed to turn his head, he accurately pointed to the place where the wooden board was being knocked. A'hui obviously didn't believe this, so he asked A'ming to sit down and test him again. It was completely correct, there was indeed such a phenomenon.

A'ming then said, "When we hear a sound, don't turn our heads first, towards the direction of the sound, but rather towards the opposite direction of the sound, and then we can determine the exact direction from which the sound is coming. This is also how we cultivate the habit of remaining calm when encountering things."

### How I Take Notes on Dramas — and Please Instruct Me, Experts

— De

Before reading, the author (or translator) looks up literary dictionaries and literary history in order to understand the author's life, their status in literary history, and the position of the play in the author's works, the date of production, and the influence it had on the literary world at the time, making a brief biography.

Plot: A drama is not just a drama, but every story is parasitic in a very good story. This story is a fragment selected by the author from their entire life, capable of starting and ending on its own and explaining the "theme" that they have used. Therefore, after reading the entire play, I use my own words to write down the story in summary.

Setting, Dramatic Form, and Dramatic Nature: The setting is the location and scenery presented to the audience when the drama is performed, such as props, background, lighting, etc. Dramatic form refers to the form of the drama, such as whether it is a one-act play or a four- or five-act play. Dramatic nature is the atmosphere contained in the entire drama, such as whether it is humorous, mysterious, terrifying, or happy, sad. I use my own words to describe the former, and examine the latter two, adding a brief judgment. It would be even better if I could name the school to which the play belongs.

Action: In a script, the characters inevitably perform actions. Here, I must study and explain why they are doing this? Why can't they not do this?

Climax: The climax is the most tense point in the development of the drama. Usually, it is at the end, but there are many exceptions; and there are also dramas with more than one climax. However, the other climaxes only serve to enhance the power of the main climax.

Characters: Here, I often observe the more important characters, recording their psychology, thoughts, characteristics, personality, etc., paying particular attention to the changes in their character, the transformation of their thoughts, etc., and adding a little criticism.

Dialogue: Dialogue not only tells the audience the story or plot of the drama, but also expresses the characters' personalities, conveys thoughts, and emotions. I often choose well-crafted dialogues, copy a few sentences, and explain their benefits, so that I can become proficient in my own dialogue skills, and at the same time, I can become proficient in my own scriptwriting skills (but a well-crafted skill is not necessarily a good script).

Thoughts After Reading: Finally, I write down my criticisms and feelings about the play, discussing all aspects such as skills and descriptive thoughts. I may as well copy and narrate the comments of major writers and critics on the play, because that can help me understand the drama.

Finally, with twelve points of sincerity, I hope that experts will instruct me on better methods. I am writing this with the intention of "throwing a brick to attract jade."

### One Scene from The Adventures of Pinocchio

Premiered in Nanjing and Shanghai

### Talking About the Story of "The Lock of the Unicorn"

— Ji

The new play compiled by Cheng Yanqiu is the most numerous and most appealing among the four famous operas. Such as the previous plays "The Jade Hairpin," "Mandarin Duck Tomb," "Biography of the Red Buddha," and "Green Frost Sword," all of which left a deep impression on people. "The Lock of the Unicorn" is his recent new play.

Before talking about "The Lock of the Unicorn," we must first have a kind of understanding of all of Yanqiu's past new plays. What must be said is that these plays that he has compiled and arranged are popular but not of low taste. Although his plays are more easily welcomed by ladies, this is precisely the power of the script. They are popular with the masses while having profound consciousness, but there is absolutely no "private determination of lifelong love" or "prince in distress," such unbearably vulgar tricks.

The plot of the play "The Lock of the Unicorn" is rich in emotion. The general idea is that a rich young lady unintentionally saves a poor girl and gives her the lock of the unicorn, which originally contained jewels. The poor girl firmly asks the rich young lady for her name in order to repay her in the future, but the rich young lady answers that she gave food to Han Xin, not for repayment. The girl asks again and again, so the rich young lady gives her the lock of the unicorn as a memento. Years later, floods cause disaster, and the rich young lady's family is scattered and displaced. A wealthy family sets up a porridge shop to help the poor, and the rich young lady begs for porridge. The owner of the porridge shop pities her and keeps her as a nanny. Under certain circumstances, the rich young lady who is working as a nanny discovers the lock of the unicorn that she gave away years ago in the owner's house, and knows that the current madam is the poor girl she saved before. At the same time, this wealthy family is praying day and night for the safety of their benefactor, who has suffered in the flood, and is distributing porridge on a large scale to create fortune for their benefactor. They meet unexpectedly, and the joy is beyond words. The nanny is transformed into a guest of honor. Later, the rich young lady's family is reunited. The general plot of this play is just like this, but its main point is that doing good brings good fortune, and receiving kindness leads to gratitude. In today's world, it should be said that "this kind of script is needed."

Finally, what is worth introducing is that Yanqiu has many new contributions in terms of singing style in this play, such as the crying head in the Er Liu Ban. This play is scheduled to premiere next week. I will make a judgment on its performance after I have seen it.

### Interesting Snippets from the Creation of "The Adventures of Pinocchio"

— Bomin

I have found some interesting snippets about "The Adventures of Pinocchio" that are worth mentioning.

"The Adventures of Pinocchio" is a fairy tale written by the Italian Lorenzini, whose pen name was Collodi. Originally, Collodi was the name of the village where Lorenzini lived in his childhood. The puppet is called "Pinocchio," and its meaning is "a little boy made of pine wood."

Walter Disney, who voiced the little puppet, recruited a hundred boys and selected Dickie Jones from among them.

In Collodi's fairy tale, a little cricket acts as Pinocchio's "conscience," warning the little puppet not to cause himself trouble. Walt Disney initially wanted to use a termite to replace the little cricket, because Pinocchio was a little puppet, but in the end he decided to use the little cricket. However, it was extremely difficult to draw various expressions on the little thing's face.

Walt Disney employed 1,200 staff members when creating this film, using 450,000 drawings. The inking and coloring department employed 200 girls, because women have more patience when doing delicate work, so these girls were mostly responsible for the inking and coloring work.

There are many sounds in this film that are very difficult to match, such as the neighing of the seahorse, the whistling of the whale, and the sound of the whale tossing and turning in the sea when it is burned and angry, the sound of the little puppet and the little cricket talking underwater, and the answer of the pendulum when it is happy and sad. When drawing the great whale Monstro, a five-foot-long tame whale was used as a model. Although the work was difficult, it was all cleverly successful.

### Theater News from Beiping and Tianjin

— Wenyuan

Zhang Wenjuan will perform Hong Zong Lie Ma at the Guangde Theater on the evening of the 22nd, and she is famous throughout Shanghai. The posters have been posted, and the seats are being booked very enthusiastically. From this, we can see the value of Wenjuan in this play.

On the 18th day of the third lunar month, the entire Peking Opera troupe worshiped the gods, led by Shang Xiaoyun, Zhao Yankui, and Zhong Zhang, still held at the National Opera Professional Branch on Cherry Blossom Slanting Street. With the consent of the classes, everything was saved. On this day, representatives from each class offered sacrifices, as usual, and Fudacheng Troupe would sing Xiao Changbi's advocated Wanguo Lai Han, and could sing Su Qin Six Kingdoms Prime Minister (the play is scheduled).

Zhang Xiangjun, a talented student of Xiao Cuihua, has recently been working hard in Tianjin to study and improve her theatrical skills and is progressing very quickly. She will perform at the Tianbao Theater.

There are only two pure spoken drama troupes in Beiping and Tianjin: (1) the Tianjin Professional Touring Drama Troupe, and (2) the Beijing Drama Club, which are respectively rehearsing famous plays such as "Sunrise" and "Wilderness."

### Twenty Kinds of Storytelling Ballads (6) The Fallen Golden Fan

— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Xiuyan

"Miss Lu Qingyun": During the Zhengde period of the Ming Dynasty, Lu Qi, the dismissed general's daughter, accidentally dropped a mud-gilded folding fan while offering incense in the Buddha hall. It just so happened that a passionate young man, Zhou Xuewen, picked it up. At that time, the Lu family was organizing a team of "female actors," and Zhou Xuewen used this as a means to advance his career, changing his appearance and entering the Lu family to learn acting. He was transferred to the boudoir, returned the fan, and courted her, and got Miss Qingyun's lifelong love."

The plot of "The Fallen Golden Fan" is quite complex, but it is all based on the general storytelling ballad with "talented scholars and beautiful ladies" as the central figures.

### Where is Japan's Diplomacy Going?

— Fang Qi

Diplomacy Occupies a Subordinate Position

There are two sentences in Japanese newspapers that describe Abe's position: "The dispatched envoy is not an envoy of peace, and the ambassador's mission is to echo the Japanese army's operations." These two sentences can not only describe Abe, but also broadly portray Japan's diplomacy, which has already fallen under the command of the sword. The correspondence between Japanese diplomacy and Japanese military affairs has a long history. However, it is quite easy for the commanded to do the corresponding work, but when it comes to needing to shout, it often becomes the dumb character being sold in a change-of-face play. Not only does he not know much about the operational situation, but the commander's sword itself does not know which direction to swing, so there is often the suffering of not knowing what to say.

Opportunism in International Politics

Before the German-Soviet Pact, Japan often used the slogan of war against the Soviet Union to reap benefits in many ways. At advantageous times, it had also launched two seemingly real wars against the Soviet Union as a test. But because it only seemed real in fact, the diplomatic correspondence also failed to shout loudly. After the German-Soviet Pact, it finally could only put aside the anti-Soviet slogan with the Nomonhan Armistice Agreement, waiting for new developments. In this situation, the war could be stopped, but the diplomatic correspondence still had to be maintained. Therefore, it humbly sought to approach the Soviet Union, while claiming to the United Kingdom and the United States that it was being wooed by the Soviet Union to intimidate them. It hoped that the Anti-Comintern Pact, which had died in vain, would be revived and was still holding on to it. If one of the three expressions is true, it just proves that the other two are all false. The relevant parties in the first two items did not try to figure out whether their expression was true or false, so it had no opportunity to explain, and it seemed that there was still an opportunity to prove the third item. Currently, Italy's attitude is gradually becoming clear, and Japan will naturally take this opportunity to express its operational plan. However, Italy is indeed standing in an uneasy situation of wanting to oppose both the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. What it can decide recently will still not be choosing one side between the two, so it still cannot make a choice for Japan, and what Japan can do is still just wait.

Intimidation of the United Kingdom

Naturally, it is very possible that Japan will simply decide to adopt an anti-British direction from Italy's anti-British expression. However, the reaction that this can cause on the British side is also very limited. If the United Kingdom believes that this can create danger, it would of course rather make concessions to Italy first to preserve the more valuable Far East and India, and Italy would also get to reap a bit of the effect of intimidation first and temporarily not resort to force. Then Japan would only remain in its original position. As for whether the United Kingdom does not value Italy's military force, it would be confident that when the Mediterranean problem is resolved, major changes will still not occur in the Far East. The naval exercises of the Italian Navy in the Mediterranean have received considerable attention from both the United Kingdom and France, but the naval exercises of the Japanese Navy in the China Seas do not seem to be worth consulting by the United Kingdom and France. This hint seems to be enough to sweep away Japan's pride in considering itself as important as Italy, so Japan's old methods towards the United Kingdom will not suddenly see results for a while. In addition, even if the United Kingdom is willing to compromise with Japan, how reliable is Japan after all? If the United Kingdom is generous and compromises with Japan, how unfavorable will the displeasure of the United States cause the United Kingdom to suffer? These are still issues that do not need to be considered for the time being.

A Deadlock Between Japan and the United States That Cannot Be Broken

From the British perspective, the attitude of the United States is a secondary issue, but from the Japanese perspective, the attitude of the United States is the most important issue. The United States can consider the pro-Japanese stance of the United Kingdom as not being anti-American, but it will definitely consider Japan's anti-British stance as being anti-American. However, if Japan wants to get the United Kingdom to compromise, it must start with anti-British intimidation. How Japan can avoid intimidating the United States while intimidating the United Kingdom seems to be a method that may not be found. On the Malaysian issue, the United States has already sent out a signal and made the commander's sword command a statement similar to an apology. Even if Japan directly targets Singapore, will it necessarily make the United States think that it has nothing to do with it? When Japan raised the Malaysian issue, it originally wanted to express collusion with Germany in addition to intimidating the United Kingdom, but Germany has not expressed anything about this, which is only a negative aspect and not the lightest touch in Japan's diplomacy.

### Foreigners' View of Japan's Economic Difficulties

— Translated by Green

Recently, foreign newspapers have published many articles about Japan's economic difficulties. One of the fundamental problems is the shortage of coal and electricity.

The Far Eastern Survey magazine, in an article discussing Japan's economic situation, stated:

Lack of Coal – Many experts have long pointed out that the lack of cheap coal is one of the main obstacles to the development of Japan's heavy industry. Nevertheless, Japanese leaders have embarked on an ambitious plan for self-sufficiency in heavy industry…

"Since August 1937, statistics on coal mining in Japan and its territories have been declared a national secret. However, the Mitsubishi Research Bureau has determined that coal production in the first half of 1939 decreased by more than fifteen percent."

According to the magazine's explanation, the reasons for the decrease in coal production are insufficient skilled workers, reduced labor productivity, and a considerable shortage of expensive mining machinery.

The lack of coal is felt particularly acutely due to the reduction in electricity generation from hydroelectric power plants. The magazine also said:

Food Shortage – The problem of Japan's food supply is also very acute this year. A very interesting article was published in a recent issue of the China Weekly Review. It stated:

"For the first time since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, and generally speaking, for the first time in many years, the food supply of the Japanese Empire is under threat. For many months, Japan and its colonies have been feeling the food shortage. Before the new harvest, these difficulties will become even more acute. Food self-sufficiency was originally based on Japan's financial, economic, and military calculations, so the Japanese people have not directly felt the serious impact of the Sino-Japanese War on the Japanese economy. Now it is no longer self-sufficient, and Japan can no longer guarantee food self-sufficiency. The 1939-40 rural economic year was the worst year for Japan. The harvests in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan were all severely damaged due to bad weather. In addition, there are war consequences such as insufficient rural manpower, insufficient farm implements, and a lack of artificial fertilizers, all of which have worsened the farmers' situation."

As a result, Japan has had to restrict the consumption of many kinds of goods, import large quantities of grain, and restrict the export of many goods.

Normally, Japan imports rice from Korea to make up for its deficiencies, but this year Korea's harvest is also very poor. It is said:

"Japan's rice shortage is at least 1.2 million tons, which must be imported from abroad. Recently, Japan has ordered large quantities of rice in Bangkok, Rangoon, and Saigon, but it is very difficult to find merchant ships to transport the rice to Japan. What is most unpleasant for the Japanese is that the imported rice must be paid for in foreign currency. The shortage of rice threatens the depletion of Japan's foreign currency reserves."

In the past year, Japan not only had a poor rice harvest, but also poor harvests of several other important grains, such as wheat and barley. It can be seen that Japan will experience a very difficult period before the new harvest.

Foreign observers link Japan's recent setbacks in China with its economic situation, and the failure of military offensives. The American magazine, The Nation, in an editorial on the Sino-Japanese War and its prospects, listed the Japanese failures: the defeat in northern Guangdong, the failure to attack Changsha, and repeated unsuccessful attempts to cut the Sino-Vietnamese supply line. It said:

"These facts show that Japan cannot organize a serious offensive. The Japanese army, floundering on the Chinese mainland, cannot inflict serious blows on the Chinese army. The lack of coal and electricity in Japan, coupled with the lack of imported raw materials, has seriously overturned the material superiority that previously formed the basis of the Japanese army's victory."

According to The Nation, the Japanese have indicated that they do not intend to continue pushing forward. The Japanese attempted to attack five times, but each time they suffered a disastrous defeat.

The Nation concludes its analysis of the Chinese situation by saying: "The war will continue until one side or the other is completely exhausted."

### The Faithful Ox is Getting Thinner

### Mr. Yonai's Personality and the Future of His Cabinet

— Eugenie

The current Japanese Prime Minister Mitsumasa Yonai was originally a "person without personality." He consecutively served as Minister of the Navy in the Hayashi, Konoe, and Hiranuma cabinets, and did not possess a political personality. He was merely a mediocre and unremarkable Minister of the Navy. Therefore, he often received consistent goodwill from all aspects of the political world, not because he could display transcendent political skills, but ridiculously because he always maintained an elder's style, always listening to the opinions of his then-Vice Minister Yamamoto. Yamamoto is now the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet. During the era when Yonai served as Minister of the Navy, the partnership between Yonai and Yamamoto was never broken. For example, when the Hiranuma Cabinet discussed its policy toward Europe, Yonai was able to maintain a resolute attitude because Yamamoto was pulling strings behind the scenes. The substance of Yonai's political affairs as Minister of the Navy was entirely the result of Yamamoto's active manipulation. Now, letting Yonai bear this current important task alone, his future is naturally questionable. Of course, Yonai took office as prime minister from the position of admiral of the navy, and the navy naturally fully supports him. However, the future of the Yonai cabinet is still not optimistic at all. Not to mention anything else, the extent to which the army's power can be absorbed into the cabinet completely determines the direction of Yonai's politics. Frankly speaking, the appearance of the Yonai cabinet in this coup process can only be seen as a transitional cabinet in Japan's political move towards a military cabinet.

### National Loan Merchants and Trademark Law The True Meaning and Application of Trademark Law

— Shouzhong

Humans cannot live independently and must gather together, divide labor and cooperate, and help each other. Therefore, human life is social life, and the organization of human life is social culture. The more advanced and tightly organized society is, the more a nation becomes. Laws are the norms of social life enforced by national power. Therefore, in addition to food, clothing, and shelter, law is a necessary condition for human survival. The more evolved humans become, the stricter the norms and the more comprehensive the laws become. The degree to which people depend on laws for survival also becomes more critical. China's political system has always been ruled by men, and the people did not know the law, only following the orders of the rulers. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the political system has undergone reforms, gradually entering the stage of the rule of law. However, due to the frequent internal strife over the years, politics has failed to be put on a regular basis, and the people's knowledge is extremely superficial. The general life is simple, and those who can understand the relationship between law and humans are very few. Under these circumstances, it is not easy for the government to exercise its power, and the people lose their protection. Cunning people take the opportunity to play with the law and infringe upon the ignorant. Even if there are extremely comprehensive laws, what difference is there from having no law?

Trademark and Business Reputation

Let us take the trademark law as an example. A trademark is a symbol of a commodity. There are many types of commodities, and there may be hundreds or thousands of commodities of the same type. Buyers have no way of distinguishing which is superior, which is inferior, which is expensive, and which is cheap. It is necessary to use a unique mark to indicate its products, so that buyers know what to choose. Merchants aim to make profits, and to achieve this goal, they must establish a reputation and promote business. In addition to improving technology, expanding the market, and expanding capital, trademarks are especially important.

Obtaining Trademark Exclusive Rights

Because there are so many types of commodities and it is difficult to distinguish them, as mentioned above, the real names of commodities are often forgotten or cannot be recognized by people. Therefore, the trademark name is used as the product name. Once a trademark is well-known, it must be prevented from being counterfeited. The only way to prevent counterfeiting is to request the government to register it in accordance with the rights granted by the trademark law. This is the acquisition of trademark exclusive rights. If anyone intends to copy it, they can sue in court and be punished.

Register According to Law Without Fear of Infringement

Due to the lack of talent and insufficient financial resources, China's industry has been progressing very slowly despite having a history of decades. Those who have already reached a considerable scale are often oppressed by foreign merchants, or rely on their strong financial resources, or rely on their special rights and interests, doing everything possible and being meticulous in every detail. They do not ignore the trivial matter of trademarks either. Their intention is nothing more than to destroy, ravage, monopolize, and control. After a domestic trademark has been approved and registered by the government, they will inevitably distort the provisions, make excuses, or even threaten and intimidate, and file lawsuits for no reason. Due to the lack of legal knowledge, domestic people often become confused and hesitant when encountering the above situations, at a loss as to what to do. As a result, they either know they are being treated unfairly but dare not argue, or they do not understand the situation and mistakenly believe that it is the most reasonable thing to do. They do not know that the loss of money is indeed limited, but the loss of reputation and business caused by having to abandon or change their own trademarks is truly small. And its impact on the entire domestic goods industry is even greater. How can those in the domestic goods industry not pay attention to it?

The Only Publication for Research and Reference

Law is a specialized science that is not easily understood by ordinary merchants. Although there are books on trademark law on the market, most of them explain the principles. Reading them is boring and tasteless, and after reading them, you cannot understand their true meaning, which does not help in practical application. It is heard that recently, Mr. Xu Guanqun, a well-known figure in the domestic goods industry in this city, and Mr. Li Huanping, who was formerly an examiner at the Trademark Bureau, have jointly compiled a book on the theory and practice of trademark law. The reporter has glimpsed its outline, revealing in detail the legislative significance and application methods of trademark law, with extensive citations and accurate interpretations. The various procedures for handling trademark registration and the handling of objections and appeals are especially the crystallization of experience. Mr. Xu, with his business, often has disputes over trademark matters, and Mr. Li has served in the Trademark Bureau for more than ten years. With the richness of experience of the two gentlemen, their writings should be insightful. People in the domestic goods industry should especially have a copy for reference.

### A Phenomenon of Joy and Fear

— Baiyu

Recently, I met a friend who runs an export business. He said that the export goods of our country are increasing day by day. In the past, the main export goods were raw materials, but now, in addition to raw materials, there are also many industrial products. Not only are various parts of Southeast Asia welcoming Chinese goods for promotion, but even various states in the United States are welcoming Chinese goods. Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia welcome Chinese goods entirely driven by patriotism, while various states in the United States welcome Chinese goods entirely because of their low prices. The devaluation of legal tender and the tightening of foreign exchange have stimulated the development of domestic goods in overseas markets. Therefore, recently, many domestic goods such as thermos bottles, seasoning powder, and grass carpets have been shipped to the United States. After listening to what my friend said, I developed a psychology of joy and fear. What is joyful? What is joyful is that the market for domestic goods is gradually expanding. What is fearful? What is fearful is that this opportunity, a good opportunity for Chinese industry and commerce to develop overseas, is such a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. If we can make good use of it, then Chinese goods can also occupy a place in the world market in the future; if we do not make good use of it and lose the trust of overseas customers, it will not be easy to open up overseas markets in the future. We know that the reason why foreigners are happy to use Chinese goods, although Chinese goods have made progress in recent years, the tightening of the exchange rate is also an important reason. Taking thermos bottles as an example, the selling price of an ordinary two-pound thermos bottle on the Chinese market is more than one yuan, which is only worth one dime in US dollars. Chinese thermos bottles are sold in the United States for two or three dimes, which is several times cheaper than American goods. Even if the shippers add tariffs and shipping costs, they still have a large profit margin. Therefore, Chinese goods are very popular with customers in overseas markets. Now that we have this good opportunity, we should take advantage of this opportunity to make various domestic goods products better and better, carefully select raw materials, improve quality, and study decoration. We should not be satisfied with being able to surpass similar products in our own country, but should aim to be on par with excellent foreign goods; we should not take low-price sales as a good strategy, but should aim to gain the trust of overseas customers with excellent quality. Take advantage of this opportunity to lay the foundation for domestic goods in overseas markets. Even if the world order is restored in the future and the exchange rate returns to normal, the credit of domestic goods overseas has been established, and there is no need to worry about the business. After listening to what this friend said, although I was filled with joy and fear, if our colleagues in the domestic goods industry can accurately grasp the goal and move forward bravely, without being satisfied with temporary short-term gains, and strive to improve the quality of domestic products, I think the joy will be greater than the fear.

### Dynamics of the National Loan Industry

Mr. Zhou Qintian, manager of Chongqing Minxin Department Store, came to Shanghai last week to purchase various domestic goods and is now contacting various domestic goods manufacturers to order large quantities of goods.

Mr. Wang Wanqing, manager and engineer of Shanghai Huanqiu Iron Factory, will be going to various parts of the Southwest in the coming days to conduct inspections, and it is heard that he will build a branch factory in the Southwest.

The Star Five Dinner Party, organized by colleagues in the domestic goods industry in Hong Kong, will hold its 100th dinner party on the 19th of this month. In addition to expanding the event, various domestic goods factories in Shanghai will donate a large number of gifts to assist. The Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao and the Singapore Sin Chew Daily will both publish special issues to commemorate the event.

Mr. Gao Shiheng, the former leader of the Southeast Asian Commercial Inspection Group, has spared no effort in promoting domestic goods in various parts of Southeast Asia over the years and is highly respected by overseas Chinese businessmen in various places. Mr. Gao knows that overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia all regard using domestic goods as the supreme glory. However, if the issues of understanding and purchasing domestic goods are not resolved first, then the promotion of domestic goods in Southeast Asia will encounter unnecessary obstacles. Therefore, he specifically established Jinnan Firm in Singapore, specializing in the promotion of domestic goods. Recently, he returned to China and invited famous domestic goods manufacturers in this city to collect their products, trademarks, certificates, and the styles, advantages, and prices of various goods one by one. He compiled and printed a book called "National Goods Supply Record," which combines publicity, advertising, promotion, certification, and sales into one. It is presented in text and photos, and 50,000 copies are printed and distributed to communities, schools, chambers of commerce, and families in various parts of Southeast Asia to establish the credibility of domestic goods in Southeast Asia and expand their trade.

### Report on Visiting the Zili Handicraft Cooperative

— Huang Jingwan

The Zili Handicraft Cooperative was founded by Mr. Xiu Lvbin. Mr. Lin is from Minhou, Fujian. He used to be a translator in the physics and chemistry department of the Commercial Press and has a good understanding of industry. He is good at operating industry with small capital. The cooperative is not large in scale, occupying only a few rooms, with about thirty male and female workers, but the equipment is quite complete. There are quite a few steam boilers, electric motors, and major machines. The recently manufactured erasing erasers are very popular among compatriots at home and abroad. This is because the import of erasing erasers has become very scarce due to the impact of China's War of Resistance and the European War. Moreover, the goods manufactured by the cooperative can be on par with high-quality imports, and the price is even cheaper. Therefore, the islands of Southeast Asia, such as Singapore, the Philippines, and Siam, are vying to order them, thus occupying the original market of German goods.

After careful examination, the raw materials used by the cooperative to manufacture erasing erasers are rubber, calcium carbonate, glass powder, oil, lime, and other raw materials. After being mixed with machines, they are baked with steam in a high-pressure closed container, which is similar to the manufacturing method of other rubber products. From raw materials to finished product packaging, it must go through more than ten steps of work.

According to the investigation, before 1935, there were two companies that manufactured erasing erasers in China, namely Chen Jiageng Company and a certain rubber factory. Both of their products had limited sales and stopped shipping long ago. Therefore, the erasing erasers manufactured by the cooperative are still manufactured exclusively in China.

The erasing erasers produced by the cooperative have three brands: (1) A brand is red and the price is the cheapest, (2) Zili brand is light red and the quality is better than A brand, (3) Wanli Kuai brand is white and the quality is similar to Zili. However, because it uses German white, it looks more beautiful, and the cost is higher, so the price is also more expensive.

### The Full Picture of Changyu Winery

— Letianzhaifu

Changyu's red and white wine has seen a sharp increase in sales in recent years, and it seems to be competing with foreign wines. Upscale families or social venues all consider it an elegant item, whether for entertaining guests or giving gifts. It is rare for domestic goods to have this honor. Now, I will describe a thing or two about the current situation of "Changyu" to entertain readers of this publication.

"Changyu" in the Past and Present

During the reign of Emperor Tongzhi of the Late Qing Dynasty, Mr. Zhang Bishi, the founder of Changyu, traded in the Dutch East Indies. He was a businessman full of knowledge and had a prominent position in the overseas Chinese community. At a banquet held by the French consul, he drank wine and brandy and inadvertently talked about wine. The French consul said that Yantai in your country is most suitable for planting grapes and making wine, which is better than this wine. Mr. Zhang kept these few words in mind. In the tenth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu, he returned to China and personally went to Yantai to investigate. It was indeed confirmed what the French consul said. The following year, he spent 3 million yuan to choose a site to build a factory and wine cellar, and also purchased thousands of acres of mountainous land in the east, west, and south to plant millions of European and American famous grape seedlings. After painstaking management, it took twenty years to form a scale. Because things were newly created, there was nothing to learn from. Although there were many wineries in Europe and the United States, in the Far East, especially in China, no second winery could be found. Therefore, the winemakers had to consult Europeans and Americans. During the twenty years, three winemakers were changed, the factory was rebuilt several times, and the grapes were replanted more than ten times. Mr. Zhang once said that he had devoted half his life to the wine industry, which shows the difficulty of starting a business. In recent years, Mr. Zhang has been striving for perfection in his products and has hired Italian winemaking expert Mr. Battista Togni as a winemaker. He has produced up to six kinds of wines, which are sold at home and abroad. They are sweet and fragrant and have been highly praised by public opinion. It will be seen that domestic wine will be sold well, and the rights and interests can be gradually recovered.

The Quality of "Changyu" Fine Wine

After crushing and fermenting ripe grapes, they are put into wine barrels in the cellar and stored for five or six years. After many precise management steps, they can be felt as wine. Then, after distilling the wine, it is stored in oak barrels for more than ten years, up to several decades, before it can become high-quality brandy. Changyu's 40-year Gold Award Brandy is an example. There are more than a hundred varieties of grapes, so the wines made also have different characteristics. They are roughly divided into six types of wine: red, white, dry, sweet, sparkling, and still. Changyu's fine wine is made from pure grape juice, so it has various benefits for the human body. According to Mr. Li Shizhen, a Chinese medical expert, wine mainly warms the waist and kidneys, preserves complexion, resists hunger and cold, and replenishes blood and qi. Regular drinking can make people strong and active, and prolong life. In modern times, people in various countries in the East and West all regard wine as a magical product for replenishing blood and nourishing life. Brandy can dispel wind and cold, and also treat vomiting, cholera, dredge tendons, invigorate blood circulation, soothe the lungs, and resolve phlegm. Drinking a little after meals greatly helps digestion. It is suitable for Westerners to drink, and the sales can be wide and expensive. In recent years, Chinese people have also been following the trend and advocating it, and there is a growing trend of it being known to every household.

Outlook for the Future of Winemaking

In the past few decades, imported foreign wines have been sold everywhere in the Chinese market. It seems that in general wealthy people's banquets, foreign wines are indispensable to show extravagance. Every year, the trade deficit in the customs books is also a huge leak. Since the "July 7th" War of Resistance, the Chinese people's psychology of loving domestic goods has been more enthusiastic. In addition, due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange, the value of a bottle of foreign wine is more than thirty or forty yuan, while "Changyu" fine wine of the same quality is only seven or eight yuan at most per bottle. Naturally, everyone's trend has changed again. Taking Shanghai as an example, the annual sales of 3,000 cases in previous years have now increased more than tenfold. Especially the overseas Chinese in the islands of Southeast Asia have been promoting it particularly hard. The markets in the southwestern provinces and cities are also gradually expanding the demand. It is expected that after the overall situation is opened up, there will inevitably be a situation where supply cannot meet demand. The raw materials produced by "Changyu" itself, fresh grapes, amount to 500,000 piculs per year. It is now planned to find ways to purchase grapes produced by the people near Yantai (estimated to be similar to the amount produced by Changyu) and mass-produce them to meet the demand. In the history of China's national industry, there has only been one "Changyu" company since the beginning (excluding handmade local wine). It has a history of fifty years and has only just established its foundation. The future development is certainly very optimistic.
