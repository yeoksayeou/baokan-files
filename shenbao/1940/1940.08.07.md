### Mitsubishi Branch Manager's Explanation: Anglo-Japanese Relations Still Tense; Two Japanese Nationals Expelled from England; Craigie Visited Japanese Foreign Minister Yesterday for Talks

London: Amidst tense Anglo-Japanese relations, one of the nine Japanese nationals arrested on suspicion of espionage was released yesterday evening. This individual was Makihara, the manager of the London branch of Mitsubishi Corporation, who had been arrested just last Friday. The released Japanese national, besides stating that he was "treated well," refused to make any criticism. At the same time, a spokesperson for the Japanese embassy formally stated that the situation arising from the arrest of Japanese nationals seemed to be "worsening." Observers felt that these remarks evidenced the seriousness of the situation. Well-informed sources said that the Japanese ambassador met with the British Foreign Secretary on Saturday to request an explanation for the arrests but did not demand the release of the arrested Japanese nationals. Observers said that Shigemitsu sent a detailed account of his discussions to the Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo for further instructions. Foreign Minister Matsuoka, considering that Shigemitsu had not reached an agreement with the British Foreign Secretary, has now decided not to take any further action and will wait for future developments. (International News Agency, 6th)

London: Yesterday, British authorities released one of the arrested Japanese nationals based on the Aliens Order, while expelling two others. British Home Secretary Sir Anderson issued an order yesterday, stating that the government had obtained sufficient evidence to confirm that Makihara, the arrested manager of Mitsubishi Corporation, was indeed a spy. Therefore, Makihara was released from Brixton Prison last night. However, Tanabe, the deputy manager of Mitsui & Co., remains detained in prison. Before Makihara's release, the British government issued a statement saying, "The authorities have considered this matter and now that it is impossible to obtain conclusive proof, there is no need to continue detaining him." At the same time, Taiwanese Bank employee Takayuki Eguchi and Mrs. Yoshii were expelled for conducting pro-fascist activities in England. A spokesperson for the Japanese embassy told the press that although he had not formally received instructions from Tokyo, he still believed that the British government's explanation for Makihara and Tanabe was not sufficient. Sources reported that Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Shigemitsu Mamoru, issued a strong warning to British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax on Sunday, saying that the British government's arrest of Japanese nationals would "endanger the work of reaching an understanding between the two countries." (United Press, 6th)

London: Makihara, the director of the London branch of Mitsubishi Corporation, who was arrested here last Friday, was released last night and returned to his London residence. It is reported that Home Secretary and Minister for Internal Security Anderson carefully considered the Makihara case and concluded that the evidence was insufficient to warrant continued detention, so he ordered his release. Earlier, a spokesperson for the Japanese embassy stated that the Japanese ambassador Shigemitsu believed that the British Foreign Secretary Halifax's explanation of the arrest of Japanese nationals in London was not entirely satisfactory but hoped that a satisfactory solution could still be found to restore peaceful relations. (Reuters, 6th)

New York: A report from London last night stated that the release of Makihara, the manager of Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan, was not sufficient to prove that Britain had adopted a policy of compromise towards Japan. In fact, Britain is continuing to arrest reputable Japanese nationals. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

Hong Kong: Due to the increasingly deteriorating Anglo-Japanese relations, the Singapore authorities ordered all volunteer forces in Singapore to resume strict training from August 7th. The atmosphere in Singapore is unusually tense. (5th)

Tokyo Authorities Decide on Countermeasures

Hong Kong: Tokyo reports that the British government's arrest of Japanese nationals has now spread beyond London to overseas colonies such as Rangoon, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The number of those arrested has reached nine. The Japanese Foreign Ministry, in view of the escalating situation, held an important meeting at 1:00 PM today, solemnly discussing countermeasures for two hours. Afterwards, they contacted the Army and Navy authorities to discuss the results. It is said that the Foreign Ministry has decided to temporarily adopt the following policy:

Konoe and Koiso Discuss Southern Advance Policy

Hong Kong: Tokyo reports that General Koiso met with Prime Minister Konoe at the Prime Minister's official residence this afternoon to frankly exchange views on the Southern issue. The two agreed on the fundamental policy of advancing south. General Koiso is scheduled to meet with the four ministers of the Foreign Affairs and Army and Navy within a few days to exchange views on the issue, and then discuss specific measures with Prime Minister Konoe. (5th)

Tokyo: According to semi-official Japanese sources, Prime Minister Konoe and former Colonial Minister General Koiso have completely agreed on the relationship between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. Political figures believe that Koiso will be appointed as the special envoy to India and the head of the economic survey team. (Haitong News Agency, 6th) Conduct diplomatic measures. (1) Japan's arrest of British spies is purely a domestic measure. On the contrary, the British measures are a sinister means of retaliation under this pretext and contain political implications. However, the Japanese side will temporarily avoid taking retaliatory measures against the British side's illegal acts. (2) Temporarily observe the extent of the British retaliatory actions. (3) Depending on the new developments in Britain, appropriate and effective means will be adopted. Foreign Minister Matsuoka has now decided to invite Ambassador Craigie to the province within one or two days to seek a formal explanation of the case and lodge a serious protest with him. In short, the Japanese side intends to pay attention to the British movements temporarily within a few days. Even if the British illegal behavior stops at this level, it is not the Japanese side's wish to resolve the case in a way that both sides bear their own responsibilities. Therefore, its attitude is very tough. (6th)

British Ambassador Visits Japanese Foreign Minister

Tokyo: British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie visited the Japanese Foreign Minister at his official residence at 5:00 PM today. It is reported that during the seventy-minute meeting, the two exchanged views on the recent arrests of British and Japanese nationals. The atmosphere during the meeting was quite calm and friendly. (Reuters, 6th)

London: A correspondent for the "Times" stated that the Japanese official statement, which pointed out that Britain and British territories arrested Japanese nationals as a retaliatory action for Japan's arrest of British nationals, was not the case. The British Foreign Secretary had already stated that the Japanese authorities had the right to conduct inquiries that they deemed appropriate for their own interests, and the British government did not question this. The British government has detained many people for the sake of British security. In addition to Japanese nationals, British and foreign nationals have also been detained. However, the circumstances of the arrest of British nationals in Japan and the criticisms in Japanese official circles and newspapers that defame British honor have made the British government uneasy and had to protest. The British government has always been cautious and does not want to incur accusations of being unfriendly to Japan. Now that the government has stated that the arrest of British nationals was not out of unfriendly intentions towards Britain, the British government feels that it may as well adopt some precautionary measures that it has intended to take for a long time. (Reuters, 6th)

Japan Did Not Protest Kobayashi's Arrest

Singapore: Toyota, the consul-general here, requested today to be informed of the details of the arrest of Kobayashi Ichiro, the manager of the Japan Oriental News Agency and reporter for Domei News Agency, but after learning the details, he did not protest. Toyota went to meet with the Colonial Secretary of this place, Mr. Weisberg, and asked about the reasons for the arrest of the Japanese reporter. Mr. Weisberg told him that Kobayashi was arrested by the authorities here in accordance with the Defence Regulations to prevent his actions from being harmful to public order and defence. Mr. Weisberg also said that he was prepared to accept the Japanese protest after the Japanese Consul-General reported to Tokyo, but Toyota's protest has not yet been filed. The authorities here have recently allowed Kobayashi's wife to visit her husband. (United Press, 6th)

Anti-British Sentiment Surges Among Japanese People

Tokyo: Many leaders of political and cultural groups in Japan visited the British Consul in Shimonoseki today, requesting him to close the consulate and requesting several British shops to close down. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

The "Miyako Shimbun" in Tokyo commented on the British authorities' arrest of Japanese nationals today, saying that the next few days will be the most critical period for deciding the future relationship between Britain and Japan. The "Hochi Shimbun" learned that the Japanese government will carefully monitor Britain's actions in the next few days. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" urged the Foreign Ministry to handle the issue with a firm attitude, and said that if diplomatic negotiations become extremely bad, it may be inevitable to resort to force, but efforts should be made to turn misfortune into blessing. The "Kokumin Shimbun" published a headline "Japanese Nationals Retiring from London," saying that Britain created pretexts to arrest Japanese nationals in London and other places in order to retaliate. However, it is too early to decide today whether Britain is risking war with Japan by its actions. The release of Makihara, the president of the London branch of Mitsubishi Trading Company, who was arrested on August 2nd, was widely reported in all the evening newspapers here yesterday. Makihara's wife took her son to a resort in Hokkaido a day before the telegram of Makihara's arrest arrived in Japan. She will return to Tokyo on the 8th. According to sources from Mitsubishi's head office in Tokyo, they were confident that Makihara would be released and will ask Makihara to remain stationed in London. (Reuters, 6th)

### Japanese Spies Actively Engaged in Activities in Hawaii; US Democratic Congressman Announces Sufficient Evidence Obtained

Washington: Democratic Congressman Scruggle claimed last night that he had obtained sufficient evidence from Hawaii to prove that "there are indeed Fifth Column elements active there." He said that as soon as the evidence is fully collected, he would submit it to the House. The Congressman clearly pointed out that the Fifth Column activities he referred to were those of Japanese nationals. He said he had received countless letters from residents and officials residing in Honolulu, confirming his previous suspicions about the Fifth Column activities there. According to his information, the Fifth Column includes a large number of Japanese residents who had previously served in the Japanese Army. Scruggle revealed that he had informed Honolulu's representative in Washington that he would publicly announce the matter to the House, and challenged the representative to publicly refute the report. He said, "I will be happy to give Honolulu's representative every opportunity to prove that the information I have obtained is accurate. I would very much like to have a thorough discussion of this matter. There are countless people in Honolulu who are engaged in activities that are detrimental to the United States. Reliable sources have stated that the existence of a Fifth Column there is undoubtedly closely related to a certain country and is subject to its orders. I have obtained all the evidence to prove that they hate the United States. They often meet to discuss expanding anti-American activities. They do not allow good American people to participate in these meetings." Hawaii representative King told reporters that he had not received the information mentioned by Scruggle, but he believed that the matter was not credible. He also said that no illegal activities had occurred in Hawaii. (United Press, 6th)

### Japan Protests Oil Embargo; US Prepares Reply

Washington: Acting Secretary of State Welles stated yesterday that the United States is preparing to reply to Japan's protest regarding the restrictions on aviation gasoline in the near future. As for Japan's opposition to the ban on the export of aircraft fuel in the Western Hemisphere, Welles declined to comment. Secretary of State Hull has begun his routine vacation after returning from the Havana Conference. Welles will continue to serve as Acting Secretary of State in the State Department.

### Salvation Army Personnel Arrested; Seven Arrested in Japan; Allegedly on Suspicion of Espionage

Tokyo: An Army Ministry bulletin announced that seven Salvation Army personnel were arrested by the military police on July 31 on suspicion of espionage. Among those arrested were Commander Uemaru and Secretary-General Segawa, who were of Japanese nationality. According to a spokesman for the Army Ministry, regardless of whether religion is needed for the life of the country, the Salvation Army is deeply concerned about the ideological defense of the country. Therefore, for these religious workers, "who use faith as a cover and act as 'informants, foreign spies, and pioneers or training grounds for foreign ideological warfare,' and who undermine the ideology of the country," strict action must be taken to deal with them.

Editorial

### A Review of the So-Called Four-Nation Economic Bloc

Over the past few days, Italy has repeatedly disseminated a fiery atmosphere, claiming that the world's four omnipotent nations—Italy, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union—will form a great economic bloc to compete with Britain and subdue it to death. Assuming this is indeed a brewing reality with the potential for realization, its impact on Britain's life or death, however, will be temporarily put aside. The alliance of these four nations undoubtedly stands as a grand structure capable of captivating global attention.

Such grand structures are rare. An idealistically pleasing grand structure often encounters inherent and acquired obstacles, ultimately disappointing those who eagerly anticipate its early realization. Germany and Italy have already been fighting shoulder to shoulder, sharing a unity of purpose. Mathematically, this represents two out of four, indicating that the grand structure has already achieved half of its potential, lacking only the remaining half. Moreover, since August of last year, Germany and the Soviet Union have concluded an agreement, dividing Poland equally. The Soviet Union's annexation in the Baltic region and its expansion in Southeast Europe have factually confirmed the tacit understanding between Germany and the Soviet Union. Recently, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's report has further morally elucidated the harmony between Germany and the Soviet Union. As for Italy and the Soviet Union, there are no issues in Southeast Europe, and it is said that relations are already harmonious, with trade about to be adjusted. From this perspective, although the signs of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union forming an economic bloc remain elusive to outsiders, as long as the Soviet Union also intends to closely associate with Germany and Italy to the point of becoming an economic bloc, this triangular love affair is bound to succeed. The Soviet Union's intentions remain unknown, but it has certainly never stated that it does not have these intentions. Assuming the Soviet Union has this intention in the future, three out of four, the remaining gap is small. Now, let's consider Japan. In its current situation, Japan eagerly seeks camaraderie, 'Birds singing in harmony, seeking a responsive voice.' Whoever endorses its wishes, whoever approves of its actions, becomes its appreciated ally. It originally had a pact with Germany and Italy, an anti-Comintern agreement, though it is said that times have changed, and this has now been abandoned. Including the Soviet Union in the ideal role of the four-nation economic bloc precludes discussing anti-communist sentiments. However, since this case remains in the historical archives and has not been cancelled, its relationship with Germany and Italy is undoubtedly different from others. Among them, Italy truly possesses sincere enthusiasm for Japan. As for Germany, in order to counter Britain, it naturally 'has high hopes' for Japan under certain conditions. It may be worth making an assumption: assuming that Germany and Japan accommodate each other in the future, and the anticipated conditions actually coincide, then the grand structure of the so-called four-nation bloc is only a very small percentage short mathematically, that is, only the issues of the Soviet Union and Japan remain. Please review this remainder.

On the first of this month, at the joint session of the Soviet Union's Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities, Mr. Molotov, in his elevated position as Chairman of the People's Committee and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, reported on foreign policy. His entire report was clear and concise, except for the section on Japan, which was hesitant and reserved, allowing for the maximum degree of maneuverability. He said: 'Broadly speaking, it seems that Japan has a tendency to improve relations. If both sides can recognize the necessity of removing obstacles, it is not impossible for the Soviet Union and Japan to improve relations. However, the so-called "new political structure" plan of the new Japanese government is not very clear. The Japanese government's slogan of advancing south has attracted the attention of major sectors in Japan, as they are extremely interested in the changes in Europe. Although, in many respects, their political ambitions are not yet clear: the same is true of Soviet-Japanese relations.' When discussing Soviet-Japanese relations, one must immediately instinctively associate them with China. Therefore, please also mention it in connection: in Mr. Molotov's report, the section on China maintained a clear and concise style. He said: 'Our relations with the great nation of China have been extremely friendly since the two countries signed the non-aggression pact. China is now fighting for its survival.' These few words express the Soviet Union's intentions towards China, which, compared to his statement about his intentions towards Japan, show that even if it is possible to improve Soviet-Japanese relations, it will not affect the Soviet Union's friendly relations with the great nation of China, which is currently fighting for survival. Furthermore, the deterioration of Soviet-Japanese relations is more obvious from Japan's invasion of China and the Soviet Union's aid to China in recent years: but the deterioration of relations is not recent but historical, not because of China, but (1) because of Japan's northward advance policy, (2) because Japan is blatantly assuming the role of the eastern vanguard of the anti-communist crusade. The Soviet Union has long since ceased to mention the anti-communist camp, which Japan has already abandoned, since August of last year. In this report by Mr. Molotov, the historical deterioration of Soviet-Japanese relations caused by Japan's northward advance policy, which has been managed and operated for decades, cleverly pointed out that Japan may change its policy in the future and switch to advancing south, cleverly contrasting this as a reason for the Soviet Union and Japan to improve relations. At the same time, Mr. Molotov also cleverly expressed that he does not trust the political ambitions of the main sectors in Japan, who are determined and determined to switch to advancing south and abandoning advancing north. Under the expression of distrust, how much possibility is there for the Soviet Union and Japan to improve relations? How much possibility is there for economic cooperation between the two countries? How much possibility is there for the so-called four-nation economic bloc?

To go a step further: If Japan does not abandon its aggression against China, then even if it launches a southern advance, it cannot be regarded as abandoning the northern advance, and it cannot make the Soviet Union believe that it no longer needs to worry about the threat of Japan's northern advance and improve relations with it. Even if Japan suddenly changes its mind and faithfully abandons its northward advance and advances south, and Soviet-Japanese relations improve, but to say that the Soviet Union is therefore willing to abandon its neutral policy, is even willing to sacrifice all possible opportunities for multifaceted development in the economy, and is even willing to accept constraints and join the economic bloc of Germany, Italy, Japan, or any other number of countries, according to the Soviet Union's national policy, is also a fundamentally unimaginable phenomenon. The so-called four-nation bloc is just a castle in the air!

### If Japan Attacks Vietnam, France is Determined to Resist; Vietnamese Troops Cancel Demobilization; Troops Stationed at Coastal Forts

London: According to a dispatch from the French western border correspondent of the Daily Mail to Vichy, France is determined to resist any Japanese attack on French Indochina. The demobilization of Vietnamese native troops has now been cancelled, and troops have been stationed at all coastal forts. French warships stationed in the Far East have all been ordered to go to Vietnam. (Reuters, 6th)

Kunming: The Central News Agency recently stated that Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam recently telegraphed the French Consulate-General in Kunming, allowing the release of goods from the Haiphong warehouse and the restoration of commercial transportation along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. The agency stated that General Decoux also promised to fully assist the Chinese side's interests in future Sino-Vietnamese commercial transportation. In addition, Chinese business circles stated that the British blockade of the Burma Road has caused dissatisfaction among the kings of the northern mountains in Burma. The kings of the northern mountains have encouraged trade between their countries and China in the past two years and are very opposed to the blockade of the Burma Road. All the kings support China's resistance against Japan, have a deep understanding of Japan's policy, and are very disgusted by it. Furthermore, according to business circles, many of the kings are descendants of northerners from China, because their ancestors moved from North China to Burma during the Manchu invasion at the end of the Ming Dynasty. (United Press, 6th)

Hong Kong: When reporters sailed to Hong Kong, they only saw three destroyers berthed outside Haiphong harbor. However, this week, the French side has adopted a firm attitude towards Japan's demands, fearing that Tokyo will increase its demands and want to obtain a naval base in Vietnam. Although Vietnam's French military strength is insufficient to cope with a large-scale invasion, most French people have expressed their attitude and are determined not to give up this valuable colony easily without a fight. The number of the monitoring team dispatched by the Japanese side to monitor the transportation on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to prevent military supplies from being transported into China has increased to one hundred. Japanese planes also fly back and forth to Hanoi every day. When the Japanese inspectors arrived, the French government provided government offices for the Japanese side to use as offices and equipped them with many cars for their use. Unexpectedly, this move opened the door to Japan's covetousness. The members of the monitoring team have engaged in extensive military and economic surveys in Vietnam and have detailed roads that are completely unrelated to the prohibition of arms shipments to China. Although the French authorities treat the Japanese with great courtesy and often treat them to lavish banquets, Governor Decoux of Vietnam has expressed a firm attitude this week, deferring any Japanese demands to the Vichy government for approval. Decoux also refused to allow a Japanese ship carrying more than one hundred Japanese people and a large amount of military supplies to land. The Japanese ship is still berthed outside Haiphong, next to the three destroyers. The Japanese inspectors have not yet questioned the French side's refusal to allow them to land. (Special Correspondent Wilson of the United Press)

Guangzhou: According to Japanese sources, the nonchalant remarks made to reporters by a staff officer of a certain South China army who recently returned from a week's tour of Vietnam have attracted great attention from the general public. He said that the French side's assistance to Chongqing is quite "generous," and simply closing the route through Vietnam is not enough to eliminate it. Before the Japanese inspectors arrived, a large amount of military materials supplied to Chongqing was dispersed to various parts of Vietnam. The news of France's collapse has not yet been announced to the people of Vietnam, and the people there have a good impression of Japan. Finally, he warned the Vietnamese authorities that if they overestimate their strength, they will incur misfortune. (Reuters, 6th)

### Japanese Troops Fear Epidemics, No Major War Expected in Summer; Japanese Troops Near Yichang Withdraw to Hankou, Attack on Western Hunan Unlikely in Near Future

Chongqing - The only military development of real significance between China and Japan at the moment is the relative quiet on all fronts and the reduced bombing of Chongqing by Japanese aircraft. According to well-informed Chinese sources, no major war is likely during the summer months, as the Japanese fear cholera, malaria, and other epidemics. If the Japanese launch any large-scale offensive, it will likely be between September and October. Local sources remain skeptical about reports that Japanese military commanders in China do not favor further incursions into the Chinese interior, believing that this depends on future international developments. If the Japanese believe that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are preoccupied elsewhere, they may attempt another large-scale offensive against Chongqing. According to dispatches from the front lines near Yichang, the main force of Japanese troops stationed near Yichang and on the south bank of the Yangtze River opposite Yichang has withdrawn to Hankou, leaving only small detachments to garrison key points. The previous concerns that the Japanese might attempt to enter Sichuan province via the eastern edge of the Hubei-Sichuan border and Enshi have now completely dissipated, as the Japanese have not undertaken any significant actions in that area. Rumors of large numbers of Japanese warships and transport ships concentrating near Dongting Lake, and of Japanese aircraft repeatedly bombing cities on the western shore of Dongting Lake, led some to believe that the Japanese might attempt to attack western Hunan from the western shore. However, in the immediate future, no large-scale war is expected in that area. The number of Japanese air raids on Chongqing, in terms of both frequency and the number of aircraft involved, has indeed decreased. Since Japan began its intense bombing of Chongqing on May 26 with the aim of "destroying Chongqing and crushing China's spirit of resistance," Japanese aircraft have raided almost daily, with sorties involving over 100 aircraft, sometimes as many as 160. While some individuals are expressing concern about the potential long-term impact of the sustained Japanese bombing, aviation experts predict that the Japanese air raids will eventually decrease, as these large-scale attacks are excessively costly in terms of personnel and equipment. This prediction appears to be accurate, as even during good weather, Japanese aircraft are not bombing Chongqing every day. Even when they do attack, the number of aircraft is greatly reduced compared to before. The most recent air raid, on August 3, involved only 36 Japanese aircraft from Yuncheng, Shanxi province. According to Chinese sources, another noteworthy fact is that Japanese aircraft are no longer concentrating their bombing on Chongqing itself. Recently, Japanese aircraft have repeatedly bombed cities near Chongqing, while ignoring Chongqing altogether. Chinese sources claim this is because the Japanese have suffered excessive losses in recent air raids on Chongqing. In addition to believing that the Japanese have now abandoned their attempt to crush China's spirit of resistance by bombing Chongqing, local Chinese and foreign observers believe that the current decrease in Japanese air raids on Chongqing is due to Japanese efforts to conserve gasoline and equipment, especially due to the US ban on the export of military materials, oil, and aircraft fuel. Local people generally disbelieve the claim that Japan is experiencing a severe shortage of aircraft fuel. According to those familiar with the situation in Japan, the Japanese military is constantly undertaking a four-year national defense program. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

### China's Fighting Strength Growing Stronger - Excerpt from a Conversation with Japanese POWs -

Somewhere in Northern Jiangxi - A Central News Agency reporter recently interviewed two Japanese soldiers, Private First Class Yoshiki Nagatani and Private Second Class Masaji Matsui, captured near Nanchang.

After three months of training, he was sent to China to fight and was captured in Xinjian County on June 2nd or 3rd. Regarding China's resistance, he said that the facts have proven that China's fighting strength is growing stronger and stronger. In this war, he felt deeply ashamed towards the Chinese people. According to Matsui, he only received three months of training in Japan before being sent to China. He was a tailor in a Western-style clothing store in Japan. He was captured on June 22nd on the highlands northeast of Wanshou Palace in Xishan.

### Already Failed

Hong Kong - The Hong Kong government's recent evacuation of British women and children from Hong Kong has provoked popular opposition unprecedented in recent years. Newspapers continue to publish strongly worded letters of opposition, and the public continues to discuss the matter. Newspapers have also published articles attacking and ridiculing the measure to the best of their ability. A public petition to cancel the evacuation has been launched, and the response has been strong. The petition lists the various drawbacks of the measure. The vacant residences left by the evacuees are being rented by Chinese families. Many wealthy families who moved here from Shanghai at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War have no intention of leaving Hong Kong. Chinese and non-British foreign residents who are not affected by the evacuation order continue to live here peacefully and are not panicking. Only a small number have voluntarily moved away. Furthermore, the authorities have encouraged several thousand Chinese refugees from outside the territory to return to their home villages, with the Japanese guaranteeing their safety. This measure has completely failed. Very few have left, and many of those who left have returned. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

When the Latvian delegation entered the venue, everyone stood up and cheered in unison. Then, the chairman of the Congress, Shvernik, requested the Latvian Prime Minister and Acting President Kirchensteins to speak. Kirchensteins, in his capacity as Chairman of the Plenipotentiary Delegation of the Latvian Parliament, requested the Soviet Supreme Soviet to annex Latvia into the Soviet Union. Kirchensteins also said, "Since July 21st and 22nd, the dark period of the Latvian working masses has passed. A new life has begun. Under the Stalin Constitution, the Latvian annals have unfolded a page of prosperity and freedom. Latvian laborers and cultural figures, who in the past selflessly and heroically fought against the oppressors in the country, have cultivated a spirit of steel among the Latvian people, finally winning victory and declaring the establishment of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic." Finally, amid thunderous cheers, Kirchensteins expressed that the Soviet Union would surely allow Latvia to join the Soviet Union. After Kirchensteins' speech, other members of the Latvian Parliamentary Delegation, Bisenieks and Papazis, also spoke in Latvian, representing the Latvian people in requesting the Soviet Supreme Soviet to annex Latvia into the Soviet Union.

At this point, Akhunbabaev, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek Republic, on behalf of the Soviet government, delivered a brilliant speech in the Uzbek language, welcoming Latvia to join the Soviet Union. Akhunbabaev used the actual situation in Uzbekistan to prove the extraordinary victory of Lenin and Stalin's national policy. Akhunbabaev pointed out that in the era of Imperial Russia, Uzbekistan was originally a backward country, but at present, it has become an advanced state in industry, agriculture, and culture. Finally, Akhunbabaev proposed the law on Latvia's annexation into the Soviet Union, which was unanimously approved by the separate votes of the two chambers. At the same time, in accordance with the Soviet Constitution, the two chambers also decided that the Latvian Republic would elect members of the Latvian Republic to the Soviet Supreme Soviet. The election date is determined by the Soviet Supreme Soviet. When Chairman of the Congress, Shvernik, announced the passage of the law on Latvia's annexation into the Soviet Union, the entire venue burst into thunderous cheers, and the members of the Plenipotentiary Delegation of the Latvian Parliament congratulated each other, shook hands with the deputies, and loudly praised the Soviet people, Stalin, and Molotov.

### Summons of Soviet Experts: Chinese Art Conference, Relics from Anyang Prove Close Relationship Between Ancient Chinese Culture and Eastern Siberia

TASS Special Dispatch: Recently, a Chinese Art History Conference was held here, attended by 200 people, including artists, experts, and historians. During the conference, participants discussed in detail the findings of Soviet experts who studied the rare and unique exhibits at the previous Chinese Art Exhibition. Mr. Goru Harifa, a member of the Oriental Culture Museum, reported on the art of the Shang and Yin dynasties of China. The report was based on the results of Soviet experts' research on ancient artifacts discovered during excavations in Anyang. The Chinese government sent ivory carvings of birds and animals to the Chinese Art Exhibition, proving that Chinese art was highly developed 2,000 years ago. Professor Fikislev said that the ancient artifacts discovered during the excavation in Anyang were the same as those discovered by the Soviets in eastern Siberia. This proves the close relationship between ancient China and the culture of eastern Siberia. Mr. Kassin, a member of the Leningrad Museum, reported on Buddhist paintings discovered by Russian scientist Koslov in Mongolia from 1907 to 1909. These objects show the development of Chinese art in the 11th century. Scientist Alexiev also recited 18th-century poems praising Chinese painting, which aroused great interest. The Oriental Culture Museum has recently published a monograph on Chinese art, which focuses on describing modern Chinese anti-Japanese art.

London: The British are still discussing the possibility of a German invasion as their material. It is reported that there is no doubt about the news released by the German Propaganda Department that the German side is setting up long-range cannons on the coast of France. The German side had previously trained soldiers to invade Norway in the eastern part of the Baltic Sea in Germany, so now they may use this old trick to invade Britain. However, the British Air Force is on strict alert, and as soon as it hears of a German invasion, it will be able to issue appropriate warnings. The German side may intend to use towed gliders. This method has been proven by the Air Force to be feasible. However, it is generally believed that the German side will use these gliders to transport military supplies for paratroopers, rather than to transport troops. (Reuters Telegram on the 6th)

### Egyptian Political Circles Denounce Italian Propaganda

Cairo: Egyptian political leaders Dr. Ahmed Maher and Dr. Hussein Heikel successively spoke out, denouncing Italian propaganda in Egypt. Dr. Maher said, "I believe that if Italy and Germany invade Egypt, they will definitely implement their political system, as they have done in the occupied territories. From then on, the existence of the Egyptian nation will be destroyed, and its freedom and independence will also be eliminated. Britain has never oppressed Egypt when it occupied Egypt before, and now it respects Egypt's independence and freedom." Dr. Heikel also said, "Nazism and Fascism do not want to liberate the people, but want to make the people slaves. Under Fascism, there is no happiness of self-respect, freedom, and independence. Because under the tyranny of dictators, freedom and independence are not allowed to exist. Therefore, everyone in Egypt hopes to see the victory of the democratic system protected by Britain, because if Britain wins, the maintenance and progress of Egypt's free political life will be guaranteed. If other countries invade Egypt, the Egyptians will wage a long-term war against them." (Reuters Telegram on the 6th)

The French newspaper "Le Temps" in Clermont-Ferrand recently reported that a total of 70,000 French youths aged 20 and 21 will form outdoor camps for a period of six months. The situation is roughly the same as that organized by American youths.

Subsequently, this youth camp will be organized every year, and representatives from all social classes will participate in it. During these six months, the participating youths will not be given military or political training, but will only be supplemented and guided in spirit and other aspects to become complete citizens. "Because young people can practice group living in the embrace of nature to temper their physique, it is of great benefit to the formation of a sense of honor." The Youth Department has appointed General Doudai to be responsible for preparing the first youth camp. The participating youths must set aside part of their time every day to serve the country, such as irrigating, afforestation, and road construction.

### French Authorities Appeal for Domestic Unity, Criticize Separatist Movements

France, Clermont-Ferrand: Bishop Dubac of the Camp City of the Bretanya region of France, aged 86, is the oldest bishop in the region. He recently published an official letter in "Paris Soir" (published in Clermont-Ferrand), stating that it is inappropriate for a minority of the Bretanya people to organize a separatist movement at this time in the hope of seceding from France. The relationship between our people and France is inseparable. At this time when France is suffering such a tragic ordeal, we will never betray it. Although our people and other French people may have differences of opinion, this has nothing to do with others. Our people and France have a common national history of four centuries. Our people have shed blood for France on land and sea, thereby proving their sincerity. In addition, all aspects of our people's intellectual, social, and economic life have always been closely related to other parts of France. The closeness of the relationship can be seen from this.

### True Account of the European War (3): An Autobiography of a British Air Force Fighter Pilot

The retreat of the Anglo-French Allied forces from the port of Dunkirk in France was greatly aided by the British fighter planes which, with a small number against a large number, controlled the skies over the port and the English Channel. The following is an account of the combat experience of a certain squadron leader of the British fighter squadron. The original text was also published in the American Life magazine, and is translated and recorded below:

My squadron, consisting of twelve Spitfire fighter planes, was ready and waiting on the morning of the first day of the Anglo-French Allied forces' retreat from Dunkirk. At 9:00 AM, we received orders to take off, soared to an altitude of 20,000 feet, and flew across the North Sea. The squadron flew closely, with radio silence. Looking forward, the coastline was very familiar. A few minutes later, we saw towns and villages around Calais on fire, with thick smoke billowing, the horizon covered by a haze. The squadron sped over the city and patrolled the 50-mile stretch of sky. Not seeing any enemy planes, we decided to descend and circled at an altitude of 4,000 feet. Suddenly, we saw a group of about 60 German planes at an altitude of 15,000 feet, including 20 bombers and 40 fighters. We regretted our squadron's mistake of flying too low. In an instant, the German fighter squadron, many of which were Messerschmitts, roared down and pounced on our squadron. Our planes also split up to meet the attack.

At an altitude of about 10,000 feet, my plane approached a Messerschmitt 110 and I pursued it relentlessly. Twisting and turning in pursuit, the propeller at the front of the plane spun rapidly like the wind. Before long, the German plane dropped rapidly, and I still pursued it closely. It was not easy to keep the German plane in the center of my sights. As soon as I had aimed, I pressed the button. The eight Browning machine guns on my plane fired simultaneously, each firing 1,200 rounds per minute, all aimed at the German plane. The smell of gunpowder from the guns filled the air. When the bullets hit the German plane, sparks flew. I caught a glimpse of the outline of the back of the German pilot's head, turning around, rotating halfway, before stopping moving, presumably hit. In an instant, the German plane caught fire, smoke billowed, and it spun down.

At this point, I looked around to pursue other planes, and discovered that I had flown 50 miles inland. Not seeing any other planes, I turned and flew back to the coast. Suddenly, I was shocked to find that my plane only had enough fuel to fly straight back to the base. If I encountered enemy planes along the way, I didn't know how I would cope. The first battle felt invigorating, but afterwards, thinking about it, I felt a chill down my spine. On the way back to the base, I used the radio to ask each of the other pilots about their results. The first to reply happily reported shooting down an enemy plane. Others reported shooting down one or two planes each, but two planes remained silent, presumably killed in action.

Back at the base, my squadron refueled and reloaded ammunition. Fifteen minutes later, we took off again. Just as we reached an altitude of 10,000 feet over Dunkirk, a large number of Messerschmitt German planes burst out of the clouds and swooped down, almost catching our squadron off guard. These enemy planes were clearly soaring high to cover the bombers in the clouds below. A moment later, bullets whizzed past my ears, and I heard the sound of gunfire from a German plane behind me. Before long, the plane suddenly descended, and I also descended rapidly in pursuit, but in the clouds, the plane disappeared without a trace.

My plane then ascended again and I saw the remaining planes at an altitude of 6,000 feet, engaged in a mixed battle with many fighters. Among the enemy planes were several Junkers 88s. I charged into the battle and turned on the radio. I overheard members of my squadron talking, mixed with the sound of gunfire sweeping the German planes. A New Zealand pilot in one plane calmly told a pilot in another plane: "You have a Messerschmitt behind you." The other replied, "Okay, mate."

I then targeted a Junkers 88 to attack. The machine gunner in the rear of the plane immediately opened fire on me. Bullets grazed the windows of the plane, clearly visible. I also aimed at the target and opened fire, firing continuously. The plane shuddered slightly and the German plane was torn in two, then plunged straight down in a ball of fire and smoke. I circled slowly and descended, seeing one of the crew jump out and float down with a parachute.

By this time there were no enemy planes in the sky. I turned around to return to base. On the way home, I called the remaining planes and learned that all the planes were safe. A total of eleven German planes were shot down. Together with the previous battle, we shot down a total of nineteen planes. The first day's victory belonged to us.

On the second day, my squadron set out on patrol again and sent two planes for individual reconnaissance. One was hidden in the clouds at 12,000 feet over Dunkirk and the other was circling at 2,000 feet. The remaining planes flew towards Calais. Halfway there, the plane above the clouds radioed the plane below: "Attention! A large number of Messerschmitts are filling the sky!" The plane below said, "Okay! Don't let them get away. I'm coming!"

Upon receiving the news, my squadron turned and flew into the airspace over the North Sea, seeing several Junkers German planes, protected by Messerschmitts, bombing a torpedo boat and several lifeboats filled with soldiers. The torpedo boat returned fire with anti-aircraft guns. My squadron swooped down unexpectedly, shooting down one enemy plane each. My squadron then ascended together, reorganized, and charged down again. By this time, the enemy planes had scattered. One of the Messerschmitts fled east, and I pounced on it. When the guns fired, the plane spewed black smoke and fell like a leaf. I flew down after it, and was overjoyed to see it crash to the ground.

At that time, the situation of the battle between the two planes above Dunkirk and the German planes was still unknown. Soon, we received a reply from one of the planes, saying that they had shot down four enemy planes. Not long after, the pilot suddenly exclaimed: "My plane has been hit and is on fire." A second or two later, the pilot said again: "There's a destroyer below. I'm going to jump out." A second later, he muttered to himself, "What to do?"

Jumping out of a Spitfire fighter plane is not easy. The best way is to turn the plane upside down, so that your back is facing down, and then jump out. Later, we learned that the pilot did use this method to jump out of the plane. Three days later, he returned to the squadron in a state of disarray, wearing a naval lieutenant's uniform, sailor pants, and carrying a sailor's backpack.

Although the battle was fierce that day, the results were not good, with only eleven German planes shot down.

On the third day, the Allied forces launched a large-scale retreat, and all the German planes were mobilized to obstruct the retreat. At dawn, my squadron went to war. We went back and forth to Dunkirk twice before breakfast, fighting no less than thirty times. The number of enemy fighters encountered the second time was unprecedented, all Messerschmitt 109s, about a hundred planes. But my squadron was very successful in repelling them. We charged up and down at altitudes from 1,000 to 15,000 feet. When pulling the control stick up after charging down, my senses were blurred, but I knew for sure that I had destroyed four German planes. The results of the other planes in my squadron were also good.

My squadron fought fiercely for half an hour, losing only one plane. One wing of the plane was destroyed, and the pilot landed on Dunkirk beach, injured in the forehead, but still managed to report to headquarters by radio that he had "landed safely." That night, he returned to the country with a team of British soldiers.

The fierce battle ended, and my squadron skirmished with a group of Messerschmitt 110s, shooting down three of them. These German planes descended very quickly. That afternoon, I dived straight down from an altitude of 15,000 feet at a speed of 550 miles per hour, chasing a plane. The German plane sped down, presumably crashing to the ground.

I then used the tail trim adjustment to help, and tried my best to pull back the control stick to ascend. Suddenly, I felt my senses blur again. First, the sunlight turned yellow, then red, gradually becoming a blur. Although I didn't lose consciousness, I couldn't see or hear, but I heard a buzzing sound, louder than the usual motor sound, deafening.

My squadron's bloody battle over Dunkirk was of great benefit. In my opinion, most of the German pilots were mediocre, and their fighting spirit and skills were not high. Although they outnumbered us, they were far inferior to the British planes in terms of quality.

British Ambassador Returned to Shanghai Yesterday
Shortened Holiday, Taking a Steamer South, Disembarked at the Great Pier Two Yesterday Afternoon
Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, took advantage of his one-week vacation on the 30th of last month and took the British merchant Taikoo Company's "Hunan" steamer from Shanghai to Weihaiwei in North China to meet his wife, who was vacationing in Beidaihe. However, because the ambassador was busy with official duties, he tried to shorten his travel time as much as possible and returned to Shanghai early.
After the reporter learned of the British Ambassador's arrival in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, he went to the Taikoo Company's pier at about 6 pm to wait. Initially, there was no movement there until 6:30 pm, when a No. 39 car from the British Embassy in Shanghai arrived at the Taikoo Pier in the 16th Concession to greet him. Two or three commissioners from the embassy were also waiting at the pier. As for the French Concession police, although they did not send police cars to implement security, plainclothes detectives were densely deployed to provide protection.
At 6:50 pm, the "Shengjing" steamer arrived at the pier and docked at the Taikoo Pier. At that time, there was a heavy rain. Around 7 pm, when the rain slowed down slightly, the ambassador, accompanied by the embassy commissioner who came to greet him with an umbrella, left the ship and walked towards the pier. At that time, the pedestrians near the pier were quite attentive. The ambassador was wearing a straw hat and a navy blue suit, with a graceful demeanor. After landing, the ambassador immediately boarded the embassy car and went straight to the ambassador's private residence on Dunsing Road to rest, to relieve the fatigue of the journey.

Customs School, Invaded by Puppet Officials Yesterday
Fortunately, Documents and Equipment Had Been Moved in Advance, Student Admissions Are Invalid
The Customs Vocational School, established by the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, was occupied by people sent by the puppet "Customs Administration" at 10 am the day before yesterday (the 5th). Fortunately, the school had prepared in advance, and all documents and equipment had been moved away, so the puppet side gained nothing. The details obtained by the reporter of Pingming News Agency are recorded as follows:
Ordered to Close Early
The Customs Vocational School at No. 12, Mache Road, French Concession, was run by the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance to train customs officers. The position of principal was concurrently held by Zheng Lai, the Director of the Customs Administration. Since the withdrawal of the National Army, Zheng has always been in Shanghai presiding over everything. With painstaking efforts, Zheng left Shanghai a month ago because the environment was getting worse and his life was deeply threatened. Mei, the director of education of the school, has also left. The central government knew that the puppet side would definitely want to get it and be willing to do so, so it ordered the school to close during this summer vacation, and only sent five or six employees to take care of the house. All files were moved to a safe place, so the original plan to recruit new students for this session was also temporarily suspended.
Stop Enrolling
Unexpectedly, at 10 am the day before yesterday, Zhang Sumin, the puppet "Director of Customs Administration," suddenly sent four officials to occupy it. At that time, the school staff could not refuse and had to listen to what they did. According to sources from the customs authorities, after the school was occupied by the puppet side, all students who continued to enroll would not be allowed to serve in the customs in the future. It was also heard that Zhang Sumin had notified the French police in advance to "take over" the school on a scheduled date, but the French police ignored it, so the puppet side took possession on its own.

The Company's Attitude Turns Harmonious, Asking Yu Qiaqing to Mediate Again
The labor-capital dispute of the British merchant Zilaihuo Company has been going on for two weeks and has not yet been resolved. According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, the situation seems to be improving since the workers of the new factory met with the management some time ago. Now the management's attitude seems to be gradually softening, and they plan to break the deadlock. Although the management has not yet responded to the workers in the labor-capital negotiations the day before yesterday, according to the news revealed by the company, they plan to ask Yu Qiaqing to mediate again. Everyone believes that Yu's mediation this time will enable the strike to be resolved satisfactorily.
Russian Anti-Communist Leader in Harbin, Not Arrested
Mesla to Be Buried Today
"The English-language Great American Evening News" reports that Mesla, the chairman of the White Russian Overseas Chinese Committee in Shanghai, was assassinated last Friday. "The English-language Great American Evening News" reported yesterday (the 5th) that General Kapuf, the former leader of the anti-communist organization in Harbin, had been arrested by the Public Works Department police for this case. It has now been verified that this is not true. Mesla's remains will be buried at the Jing'an Temple Cemetery at 5:45 pm tomorrow (the 7th). The Russian team of the Merchant Corps and the White Russian Boy Scouts will send teams to participate in the funeral. At the same time, two Koreans in Hongkou, who are believed to know the car taken by the murderer who assassinated Mesla, have been arrested by the Japanese Consulate Police Department and are still in custody. The Japanese investigation is still unknown, but it is expected that the Japanese will cooperate with the Public Works Department police to continue the investigation.

The National Government Issues Aviation Bonds Worth US$5 Million
To Be Repaid Within Five Years After the War, Soliciting Donations from Overseas Chinese
In order to handle aviation fundraising to purchase aircraft and promote aviation education, the Overseas Chinese Department of the National Government submitted a request to the government for approval to issue aviation bonds worth US$5 million. It is stipulated that they will be issued at 100% of the face value. After the end of the war, the government will issue aviation lottery tickets, and the remaining funds will be repaid in installments by lottery within five years. The bonds are in denominations of 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 10 yuan, and 5 yuan. Commissioners have been sent to various places to solicit donations from overseas Chinese.

New Hurricane Track
According to the Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry to the Observatory yesterday morning about the new hurricane that has risen in the Pacific Ocean, its progress is very slow. The current location is 17 degrees north latitude and 135 degrees east longitude. The direction has turned due west. The center of the wind is within 120 nautical miles. Its trend is still difficult to understand for the time being.
Shipping Routes to Be Opened Between Shanghai and Vladivostok, Tea Cargo Ships
Chinese tea will be purchased, transported, and sold in a unified manner by state-owned enterprises designated by the government, and will be managed by the China Tea Company. Hong Kong has always been the main place for centralized export. Han Meilai, the Commissioner for Commercial Control of Hong Kong, issued a ban on tea exports, saying, "This Commissioner exercises the powers granted by Article 50 of the 1940 Defense Regulations and promulgates an order with the approval of the Acting Governor, prohibiting the export of tea, except for those with licenses signed by this Commissioner or an official of this Commissioner's office." This will have a great impact on the centralized export of Chinese tea from Hong Kong. It has been found that the tea exported from Hong Kong is mainly destined for the Soviet Union. Before the war, it was transported from the production area to Shanghai and then to Vladivostok. After the war, it was concentrated in Hong Kong and then transported to Vladivostok. A barter contract has also been signed with the Soviet Union. It is heard that the Tea Company has decided on a new transportation method: (1) It will be transported by the China-Soviet highway to the northwest and then to the Soviet Union. (2) The old method of transporting to Shanghai, loading ships, and transporting to Vladivostok will be restored. Now some transport vehicles have been designated on the China-Soviet highway to transport tea. Cargo ships will be opened between Shanghai and Vladivostok. As for the Chinese tea stored in Hong Kong, about 5,000 boxes in total, how to deal with it is being considered.
British Writer in China, Simpson, Suddenly Died in Dalian
Detained by the Japanese Authorities for Two Weeks Before His Death, The British Authorities Have Not Received an Official Report
According to news confirmed by foreigners, Simpson, a well-known British writer who has been living in China for a long time, died suddenly in Dalian at the beginning of last week after being detained by the Japanese authorities for fourteen days. The British officials here said that they did not know anything about this matter, but admitted that they had also heard of this rumor. However, according to sources from Dalian, Simpson's death is well known in Dalian, but most residents dare not talk about it publicly.
Died Shortly After Being Released from Prison
It is said that Simpson had previously received a warning of expulsion from the Japanese authorities, but the "crime" that caused the expulsion warning is unknown. Later, Simpson was not expelled, but was changed to being detained. After being in prison for fourteen days, he was sent to a hospital and died within 24 hours.
Expelled in Harbin
Simpson was well-known in the Far East. Before the "September 18th Incident," he served as an advisor to the Manchukuo government. Later, he published the "Harbin News," a Russian and English newspaper in Harbin. Because it published articles that were unfavorable to the puppet "Manchukuo" authorities, he was banished by the puppet "Manchukuo" authorities to Dalian.
Yesterday Morning, at the Entrance of the Dahua Ballroom, Italian Marines Caused Trouble
Chinese Police Beaten, Fired Gun in Self-Defense
At about 2 am yesterday, four members of the Italian Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, all dressed in plain clothes, with no ties or shirts, insisted on entering the Dahua Ballroom on Avenue Edward VII. At that time, the guard on duty tried his best to prevent them from entering. The Italian soldiers were furious, and one of them slapped the doorman in the face. The doorman then resisted with a wooden stick. While they were arguing with each other, a Chinese police officer (No. 102) from the French Concession, who was on duty nearby, came to mediate. Unexpectedly, the Italian soldiers beat the Chinese police officer and tried to take his pistol. The police officer saw that the situation was not good, so he fired two shots in self-defense. Unexpectedly, the bullet hit one of the Italian soldiers in the foot. At that time, the Italian soldiers fled in all directions. Only one injured police officer and another person immediately sent the injured person to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The injury was minor and there was no major problem. The other person was detained in the police station, but both were allowed to return to the Italian Barracks on Chengdu Road. The Italian soldiers were guards of the Italian Embassy and did not have a curfew pass.

French Concession Deputy Inspector Killed in His Apartment Yesterday Morning
Murderer Knocked on the Door, Fired a Single Shot, Fatal Wound, The Deceased Was Dedicated to Matters Concerning the Japanese Side
At about 8 am yesterday, an assassination case occurred on Terrace Road in the French Concession. The deceased was Paul Yankovsky, Deputy Inspector of the Criminal Department of the French Police Department, who was 50 years old. The details are as follows:
Opened the Door to Greet a Guest, Suddenly Shot
At about 7:55 am, Yang was at his private residence at No. 27, Lane 17, Terrace Road, when he suddenly heard someone ringing the doorbell outside. He went to answer the door. Unexpectedly, as soon as the door opened, a thug suddenly shot him, the bullet piercing his throat. Yang fell to the ground in extreme pain. Seeing that his purpose had been achieved, the murderer rode away on his original bicycle. Yang was seriously injured and his breathing was weak. He was rushed to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but he died on the way at about 8 am. A Western woman living next door to Yang at the time witnessed the tragedy from the window of her apartment. She said that a few minutes after the thug fired the shot, Yang immediately fell to the ground in the passageway of his apartment, with blood flowing from his throat.
Fluent in Japanese, Naturalized as French
Yang was a White Russian who became a French citizen. He was born in Vladivostok in 1890. In 1929, he joined the French Concession Police Department. He specialized in matters concerning the Japanese side. All matters related to the Japanese side in the French Police Department were translated into French by him from Japanese. He spoke Japanese fluently. It is said that he specialized in arresting terrorist criminals, and his death may have been because he was too familiar with the background of the recent assassination of Mesla, the chairman of the Russian Overseas Chinese Committee, and had important evidence. Yang was formerly a royal officer in the Imperial Russian era, serving as a lieutenant in the army. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, he joined the French army and served as an air force captain in the First World War. He made special achievements and received an air force medal. After the European war, he served in the French Indochina Defense Forces. Recently, he also served as a lieutenant colonel in the French reserve forces.
Owned Property in Korea, Quite Wealthy
It is said that during the Russian Revolution, the man fled to Chongjin, Korea, where he lived and learned Japanese. Then he traveled to Harbin and other places before coming to Shanghai and joining the Russian Overseas Chinese Team of the French Concession Police Department. Because of his special achievements, he was specially allowed to become a French citizen. Yang's wife is also Russian, and they have a son and a daughter, both in their twenties, who are currently vacationing at the Zhuyi Hot Springs in Korea. It is rumored that the Yang family owns 30,000 mu of land in the hot spring area and is quite friendly with the nearby Japanese and Koreans.
French Concession Mail Examined, Unavoidable
Attention Should Be Paid to Communication
After Japanese inspectors re-entered the Masnan Road Post Office the day before yesterday and seized a large number of mails, the problem of mail inspection in the French Concession has become concrete. All the Japanese inspectors repeated their arrival at the post office yesterday morning and entered the inspection room to continue inspecting the mail they had taken away yesterday. A large part of them were returned. After checking, the post office handed them over to the postmen for delivery. The mail posted at the post office yesterday was still read and selected for inspection. The general situation was exactly the same as that implemented by the Management Bureau. Also, the office hours of the Japanese inspectors have gradually become regular since the day before yesterday, from 8:30 am to 12:00 pm and from 1:30 pm to 5:00 pm. Since then, the freedom of communication for mail posted within the French Concession has also begun to be deprived.
Yesterday's Situation
The Japanese inspectors continued to enter the Masnan Road Post Office at 8:30 am yesterday, but the number of people had been reduced from nine to eight. Three of these inspectors were wearing their own pistols. They then took away more than 100 letters and printed matter, and more than 20 registered letters. It was found that dozens of letters and printed matter and six or seven registered letters were inspected throughout the day yesterday and not returned. It is still unknown whether they will be seized.
Scope of Inspection
The inspection of mail at the Masnan Road Post Office is the same as that implemented by the Management Bureau. Therefore, there is no certainty as to whether the number of inspectors will decrease or increase in the future. The scope of inspection is very wide. In addition to mail, letters in each mailbox and parcels will be unavoidable.
Chongming Massacre Not Over, Has Become a Terrorist Area
The Essence of the County Has Been Turned Into a White Land
Several Places Are Deserted
Japanese Troops Stationed in Chongming, After More Than 100 Japanese Soldiers Were Ambushed by the Chinese Army, In Order to Vent Their Anger, They Implemented an Unprecedented City Slaughter. According to Refugees Who Fled to Shanghai, The Japanese Army Is Still Continuing to Burn Houses and Kill People. From Er Tiao He to Xinkai He, He Xi, Yibei, Rixin Town, Huangmao Two Towns, Shihe Town, Daxin Town, Jiang , Xishi Town, Puzheng Port, Xiaoshi He, and Other Villages and Towns, Tens of Miles Around, Have Been Turned Into Scorched Earth. The Essence of the Whole County Has Been Burned, and More Than 1,000 People Have Been Killed, Including the Puppet "Self-Defense Corps." No One Buried Them. The Japanese Army Burned Them All, So the Stench Was Everywhere, Making People Want to Vomit. As for the Navigation, Although There Are Still Japanese Merchants' Zhejiang Maru and Qingyun Maru Ships Coming and Going (The Docks Are Shanghai, Puzheng Port, Xinqiao Port, Er Tiao He, and Nanmen Port), Now Only a Few Elderly People Go to Shanghai to Visit Their Old Homes or Relatives. Young and Strong People Have Long Disappeared Because They Are Afraid of Being Killed. Also, Because Er Tiao He and Xinqiao Port Are Deserted, They No Longer Stop There.
Since the 4th, the Japanese Army Has Said That Military Needs Are the Reason, and the Traffic Has Been Cut Off From Dongmen to Puzheng Port (a Distance of Fifty Li). There Have Been Several Cases of Residents Being Killed Without Knowing It. Chongming Shanghai Fellow Townsmen's Groups, Because Their Hometowns Have Suffered This Disaster, and No Less Than Six or Seven Thousand Refugees Have Fled to Shanghai, Without Food or Clothing, and Are in a Terrible Situation, Have Launched a Relief and Reception Effort.
Rumor of Suspension of Sale of Tickets to Englishmen, Denied by the Japanese Side
Regarding the rumor that various ships to Japan will suspend the sale of tickets to Englishmen, which the Japanese authorities will implement, the Japanese merchant Dongya Shipping Company, located in the Licha Hotel on the north side of the Waibaidu Bridge, learned that it was not true. It is said that they have not received such a notice from the Japanese authorities, so the Shanghai Maru, which arrived in Shanghai from Japan at 3 pm yesterday, sold tickets to Englishmen as usual. The ship is scheduled to set sail for Japan at 9 am yesterday. It is also rumored that the company may not sell tickets to Englishmen in the future.
Curfew in the Northern District of Hongkou, Temporary Martial Law
In view of the imminent arrival of the anniversary week of the August 13th Shanghai War, the authorities of the two concessions are on strict guard and have increased police patrols to curb all possible unfortunate incidents. The curfew will also be seriously handled and measures will be taken. The curfew time will be from 12:30 am to 5 am. The authorities have adopted this method since the night before. It is heard that on the Hongkou side, the Japanese side also adopts the same method for pedestrians who want to pass through the northern district.
The Soviet Union Actively Assists China, Supporting China's War of Resistance
Holding the Same Principles as Fighting for Freedom, Providing Large Loans and a Large Amount of Military Supplies
Words of the London Correspondent of TASS
"The North China Daily News" reports that the London Aid China Committee recently invited Rustan, the London correspondent of the Soviet TASS News Agency, to speak on the Soviet Union's assistance to China in the fight against Japan. When Chairman Yu Ming introduced Rustan to the crowd, he mentioned British Prime Minister Churchill's remarks, saying that Churchill's statement that Britain was determined to fight to the end was the same as the statement made by the Chinese government in December 1937. China was able to see what Britain is doing now, and could not help but recall the early stages of the Chinese war.
Providing a Large Amount of Material Assistance
Rustan continued his speech, saying that in order to seek national independence, the Soviet Union has repeatedly expressed its purpose of supporting China and has provided a large amount of material assistance during the three years of the war of resistance. The Soviet Union's credit loans to China amounted to 60 million pounds sterling, and the US loans to China amounted to 11.25 million pounds sterling, and the British loans amounted to 8 million pounds sterling. After the Chinese delegation first appealed to the League of Nations General Assembly and the civilized countries for assistance, the Soviet Union immediately complied with all its obligations to the League of Nations and responded.
Signing a Non-Aggression Treaty
Since China's last appeal, the Soviet Union has assisted China in other ways and signed a non-aggression treaty. In 1937, China made extremely humble suggestions to the League of Nations and the Beijing Conference, requesting spiritual and material assistance. Only the Soviet Union supported it.
The Soviet Union Restrains the Japanese Army in Manchuria
By January 1938, the Soviet Union's supply of military equipment to China had gradually increased, which had attracted the attention of reporters from London newspapers and was recorded. In April of the same year, assistance became more active, causing the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union to protest, saying that the Soviet Union's move violated its neutrality. The Soviet Union has established a strong Red Army, so that the elite of the Japanese Army cannot be transferred from Manchuria.
Assisting Those Who Fight for Freedom
The Soviet Union has also signed a trade agreement with China, which is the only trade agreement China has signed on a completely equal basis. What is the reason for the Soviet Union's actions? This is the most important point. The world naturally wants to see its explanation. If this explanation is not fully understood, then the Soviet Union's policies will be incomprehensible. It is important to know that one of the basic principles of the Soviet Union is to expect freedom, and people who are willing to fight for freedom cannot use the people of other countries, and must provide the greatest assistance to the people of other countries who are fighting for their freedom. This is the real explanation.
The Principles of Struggle Are Consistent Between the Two Countries
Any people who are ruled by foreigners and still allow the rulers to oppress them, especially the people in colonies and semi-colonies who are oppressed, cannot claim to be fighting for civilization and freedom. The Soviet Union's assistance to China is because it sees that the principles of China's struggle are the same as the principles that the Soviet Union itself holds, and it is not for the sake of seeking material assistance in the future. The world must understand this point, otherwise we will judge Soviet politics and may go astray.
Fiction and Slander Are Smoke Screens
Rumors that Stalin intends to divide China with Japan are intended to make people distrust the Soviet Union. These are actually harmful to China. All kinds of fiction and slander are nothing more than smoke screens to cover people's eyes. The facts are very different, that is, the agreement between Britain and Japan on the disposal of the Tianjin bank deposited by the Chinese government. It is undeniable that the Chinese government was forced to accept this agreement, but it cannot be denied that the Chinese government warmly welcomed it.
Who Is Spreading the Rumors and What Is the Purpose
Because the world may misunderstand the Soviet Union's policy towards China, fiction and slander can be used as smoke screens to conceal compromises that are not a disaster for China, but are ultimately unfavorable to China. In short, we must be careful to prevent the Soviet Union's policy towards China from being misrepresented. If we see misrepresentation, the best way is to investigate who is spreading it and what is the purpose.

Moya Silk Weaving Factory Deputy Director, Mo Rude, Was Kidnapped Yesterday
Four Bandits Appeared in the Downtown Area
Jumped into a Car and Forcibly Took Away the Ransom
Mo Weixin, Courtesy Name Rude, a native of Wuxing, 29 years old, Deputy Director and Shareholder of the East China Management Office of Moya Silk Weaving Factory at No. 207 Tianjin Road, Public Concession, has been working in the factory for about two years. His family rents a house at No. 539 Haige Road, a cross-border road in West Shanghai, because he has some assets and owns a private car, number 218.
Bandits Boarded the Car and Drove Away with the Ransom
At about 12 o'clock noon yesterday, Mo finished his work in the management office and returned to his residence for dinner as usual. He stepped into the No. 228 car at the entrance, driven by the driver A Si. The car had not traveled a few steps before it reached the corner of Tianjin Road and Shanxi Road. Because the street was narrow and there were fruit stalls on both sides of the road, the car was driving very slowly. Suddenly, four bandits in short clothes flashed out from the sidewalk, all holding pistols. Three of the bandits crowded into the car, threatened Mo Rude with guns, and one bandit stepped onto the front of the car and threatened the driver A Si, not allowing him to make a sound, and forcibly drove the car forward. When they reached the Nanjing Road intersection, the traffic police on duty were releasing the red light, and pedestrians and vehicles were prevented from traveling south. The bandit driving the car was anxious to take the ransom and escape, so he ignored everything and made a small turn and drove east along Nanjing Road. At that time, a streetcar was overturned, but fortunately no one was injured.
The Driver Was Also Kidnapped
After the factory learned about it, it reported to the Central Police Station to rescue Mo and track down the bandits. As for the driver A Si, who was kidnapped along with him, he had not been released by 6:30 pm. There was also no news of the discovery of the No. 218 car. Moya Silk Factory is a limited company. Before the Shanghai War, its business was good. Because the silk fabrics produced by the factory were sold well in other places, its business has been declining due to environmental factors and traffic congestion. It is said that Mo's parents both passed away last year, and he also has a younger brother named Ruyi, ) born to his stepmother), who is ten years old and is still studying.
Huangshan Port, Jiangyin, Has Been Opened as a Military Port by the Japanese
Jiangyin is located on the Yangtze River, with many ports and forks. The farmland and water conservancy in the coastal areas all rely on tidal irrigation. Since the three years after the war, the ports along the river, such as Huangshan Port, Shengang Port, Xiagang Port, Ligang Port, and tidal floodgates such as Nanzha Gate and Dingbo Gate, have all been changed. Huangshan Port has been used as a military port by the Japanese and ships are prohibited from sailing. Xiagang Port and Nanzha Gate have been blocked by the Japanese, and 20,000 to 30,000 mu of farmland in the relevant towns and villages have no way to irrigate. Only Huangri Port and Dingbo Gate are as good as ever. Ships and cargo transportation must be "taxed." This time, there has been a drought and little rain, and the fields in the Xixiang area have suffered the most.

Business News

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Bulls Gradually Wavering

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listing price revealed with no change. The black market for British and American exchange rates was sometimes tight and sometimes loose, with an uncertain trend. The afternoon brought news of the withdrawal of ambassadors by both Britain and Japan, which operators generally regarded as negative news, causing speculative bulls to waver and sell. The market reported gains, but the afternoon situation was confusing. Hong Kong Electric and Sassoon came to sell, while Wah Hsing absorbed slightly. Japanese banks had both buying and selling activities. Prices had hardened, and the market was potentially loosening due to the spread of the aforementioned news. The closing results were: Central Gold at 3/4.734375, US Dollar at 5.71875, British hard by 0.015625 compared to the previous day, US loose by 0.0625. The US dollar futures for this month saw a slight squeeze, and the forward trend was the same as the spot.

Hong Kong Electric and Sassoon Both Sell Off

In the early morning, London's large transactions caused both near-term and forward prices to rise by 0.1875. The New York silver price reported flat, and the London spot gold remained unchanged.

After opening, Japanese bank Mitsui first came to sell, selling the American bank August US dollars at 5.6875. The market was stable and slightly hard. Later, Japanese bank Sumitomo entered foreign banks for September US dollars at 5.625. HSBC's listing price revelation did not move. The silver balance tax increased by 1.00%. After this, speculators sold off a lot, and the underlying trend was still hard, selling Wah Hsing and Jin Cheng August US dollars at 5.71875. Subsequently, due to the foreign banks' good appetite, the trend was uncertain. At times, Sassoon sold August US dollars to foreign banks at 5.6875.

Lack of Buyers in the Aftermarket

The market was slightly hard in the afternoon. Speculators sold this month's US dollars to foreign banks at 5.71875. Later, news of the withdrawal of ambassadors by Britain and Japan spread, and operators regarded this as negative news. There was a shortage of buyers for a time, and prices hardened.

### Rumors Erupt, Gold Market Retreats Slightly After Closing

Yesterday's cash cooked raw gold black market situation revolved around 5,600 yuan, and confidence remained strong. However, the exchange market's tightness and looseness depended on reports, and the trend was unclear. Buying and selling could offset each other. However, after rumors of the mutual withdrawal of ambassadors by Britain and Japan spread, operators regarded this as negative news, and sellers competed, putting downward pressure on the closing price. The morning opening was 5,570 yuan. After being fiercely sold off by securities firms and money changers, it plummeted to 5,545 yuan. Soon after, gold firms, securities firms, and retail investors all absorbed, and buying sentiment was strong for a time. News of tightening foreign exchange rates pushed the price up to 5,615 yuan. Subsequently, with the return of foreign exchange, many retail investors came out again, immediately falling to 5,570 yuan. Hong Kong gangs had a good appetite and returned to 5,600 yuan before closing. The result was 5,585 yuan. The aftermarket was flat and tired, opening at 5,575 yuan. Thanks to slight picking up by gold firms and securities firms, it rose by several tens of yuan. Ultimately, due to rumors of negative news, the lack of buyers caused it to fall to 5,580 yuan at closing, a slight increase of 5 yuan compared to the previous day. However, it was quite sluggish after closing, at only 5,565 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was two thousand several hundred taels. Gold jewelry shops immediately returned to flat after rising. Customs gold, etc., remained unchanged.

Cooked Raw Still Up 5 Yuan

From the morning, the initial price per bar (ten taels) was stable and calm due to the flat exchange market. The opening fell slightly by 5 yuan, with silver shops quoting 5,570 yuan per ten taels of gold. Due to the sale by securities firms and money changers, and because the foreign exchange rate was reported to be loose at this time, although Hong Kong gangs picked up slightly in the middle, it was ultimately pushed down by more than 20 yuan. Money changers quoted 5,545 yuan for 20 taels of gold, which was less. Fortunately, gold firms suddenly took advantage of the low price to pick up fiercely, and the market trend turned suddenly. And soon the exchange market suddenly reported a return to softness, causing retail investors to compete to pick up on seeing the scene, and Hong Kong gangs also made purchases, so it went beyond the 5,600 yuan mark for a while. Silver shops sold 30 taels for opportunistic profit, rising to 5,615 yuan. Unfortunately, the good times did not last long, and soon dissipated. A certain money changer released a lot of long positions, and floating long positions followed suit, retreating again to 5,570 yuan. Later, silver shops took advantage of the low price to buy in, and gold firms' buying intentions rekindled, and it rose to 5,600 yuan again. However, as buyers decreased before closing, many retail investors sold off, so the closing was only reported at 5,585 yuan. The opening in the afternoon was a small increase of 10 yuan, with silver shops quoting 5,575 yuan for 30 taels of gold. Subsequently, thanks to the dragging in by cash gold firms and securities firms, it once rose to 5,593 yuan. In the end, due to the selling by money changers and silver shops, the late closing was only 5,580 yuan. The result was an increase of 5 yuan compared to the previous day. However, the underlying trend was weak after closing. Due to rumors on the market that relations between Britain and Japan were deteriorating and that the two countries were withdrawing their ambassadors, it had fallen to 5,565 yuan under the selling pressure from securities firms and silver shops, but there were few transactions. The total fluctuation for the day was 70 yuan. The selling price of cash gold firms' own brand gold was more than 10 yuan higher than the cooked raw gold, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there was little trading.

Jewelry Gold Immediately Returns to Flat After Rising

Silver jewelry shops initially hung 570 yuan per tael, but at 10 o'clock it was raised by 10 yuan, and at 10:25 it fell back by 10 yuan. As a result, Da Tong Hang still hung 570 yuan. The new shops were similar to the above price, with the buying price reduced by about 30 yuan.

### American Dollar Notes Fluctuate Irregularly

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw cooked raw currency with a firm and stable situation. British and American gold pounds also rose slightly by only 0.5 yuan. The supply and demand for British gold notes were equal, and the market price stood flat. American gold notes fluctuated irregularly. It initially traded at 17.45 yuan, then gradually decreased to 0.8 yuan, then suddenly rose to 0.6 yuan. In the afternoon, it retreated to 17.42 yuan, a decrease of 0.05 yuan. Hong Kong notes followed the high Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate to 3.95 yuan. The demand for Japanese gold notes did not decrease, and the evening market continued to rise to 1.315 yuan. The supply and demand for Korean notes remained even, and the evening market still stood at the original price of 1.095 yuan.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Excited, Land Reclamation Stocks Also See High Prices

In the securities black market yesterday, the morning rise was the most powerful. In the afternoon, the A and B types of bonds rose even more vigorously. The C and E types had broken through the 50 yuan mark, and the situation was generally good. Market sentiment was gradually interested, but the floating long positions were being cashed in for profit, resulting in a slight pullback. However, the A type has always been exceptionally strong. Because of the special relationship with a certain number, E type stocks were being sold off for profit, so they were uniquely sluggish. The general trend should continue to be optimistic. Yesterday, Wan Chang, Lianyi, and Yongkang, etc. sold A type stocks, but it was not enough to satisfy the appetite of buyers. Songmao, Jiufeng, etc. were in great demand, so the highest price was almost 2 yuan. The E type was sold slightly by Ren Chang and Lian He. After opening in the morning, the C type stocks rose in a straight line to a high of 50.15 yuan. Demand was widespread for a time. Xinfu and Hongda's buying in was not surging. The rising trend was too fierce, attracting selling from Yitai, Lianyi, Hengfu, etc., so it retreated to 50 yuan. In the afternoon, Lemao and Yongkang came to purchase again, reaching 50 yuan again. The D type continued to rise due to the purchase by Shangliuhao. The result of the day's market situation was that, except for the E type, which was uniquely down by 0.05 yuan, the rest continued to rise consistently, by 0.2 to 0.65 yuan. The total transaction volume was over one million yuan. A simple table is listed below.

Stock trading included 100 shares of Bank of China, priced at 64.75 yuan, 10 shares of China National Goods Company, priced at 26 yuan, and 40 shares of Silk Industry Bank, priced at 26.5 yuan. All three transactions were calculated in legal tender. The public industry stock market was quieter yesterday, and the fluctuations were not as great as the previous day. There were still many transactions. The China Land Reclamation stock was extraordinarily active. Because it was rumored that it would issue an interim dividend, the opening price was only 14.7 yuan, then it gradually rose to a high price of 15.8 yuan, and closed at 15.5 yuan, with a transaction volume of 111,000 shares. The rest of the market situation did not have major fluctuations, and seemed to be awaiting a more definite change in the situation.

London, 5th (Monday): Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds and Far Eastern British merchant companies' stocks were generally flat, with only the rubber stocks of Great Lakling falling uniquely by 1 shilling 3 pence, priced at 13 shillings 9 pence, and the rest unchanged.

### Financial Commentary (Continued) (5) (Day)

— Sheng Kai

Because the regulations stipulated that import and export merchants should enjoy the exchange rate difference and pay the balance fee according to the legal price and the Chinese Exchange listed price, I personally wrote an article on July 5, 1939, discussing the size of the commercial exchange rate. However, the listed prices of the two Chinese banks have been pegged at 7 pence for the British exchange rate, 13.625 yuan for the US exchange rate, and 2.145 yuan for the Hong Kong exchange rate since they were listed, and they have been pegged at this level for various reasons until the end of July of this year, without any changes. When the 7 pence stipulated in July 1939 was very close to the black market exchange rate. In June 1939, the black market was 6 and 7/8 pence, and it was lower than the black market. The average number from January to June 1939 was 7 and 13/16 pence, so 7 pence was very appropriate. Since the beginning of this year, the black market exchange rate has gone from tight to soft and then greatly shrunk on May 2. Since the recovery on May 10, the British gold has hovered within 4 pence and the US gold has fluctuated around 6 yuan until the end of July, which is too different from the commercial exchange rate set last year. Calculated at an average of 4.1615 pence for the British exchange in the first half of 1940, the difference reached 68%. As for the average US exchange rate of 6.3995 yuan, the difference with 13.625 yuan as of August 3 was 113%. This is because the 13.625 yuan set by the arbitrage calculation was based on the market price of 4.68 yuan for the pound sterling. Later, the free pound sterling in the New York market was produced, and the Shanghai exchange market followed the US dollar, so the difference was particularly large. From this point of view, the commercial exchange rate really should have been revised long ago. This new setting of 4 and a half pence is really not surprising, not to mention that the commercial exchange rate can be large or small. At the same time, according to the effective foreign exchange and trade control measures currently implemented by the Chinese government, the Central Bank is still maintaining the statutory exchange rate, importers still have to pay the balance fee, and exporters still get to enjoy the exchange rate difference.

After the commercial exchange rate was changed to 4 and a half pence for British gold, the US and Hong Kong exchange rates of course changed accordingly. However, does the so-called market exchange rate of the pound sterling refer to the free pound price in the New York market or the statutory pound price in London? If calculated according to the statutory pound price of 4.02, the US exchange rate will be set at 7.5375 and will not change every day. If calculated according to the free pound price, it will change every day. If calculated according to the closing price of 3.835 yuan for the pound sterling in the New York market on July 31, the US exchange rate should be 7.190625. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, calculated according to 1 shilling and 3 and 1/32 pence to the British pound, 1 Hong Kong dollar should be equal to 3.34 yuan. Therefore, although the commercial exchange rate will be higher than the black market exchange rate in the future, it is very close. Compared with the average number in the first half of 1940, the difference is only from 7% to 13%.

In addition, the biggest reason for changing the commercial exchange rate is to strive to collect foreign exchange funds and encourage the export of local goods. Because the black market exchange rate of legal tender in the past was far lower than the commercial exchange rate, merchants could not make a profit from shipping goods for foreign exchange settlement, and they would suffer losses. Therefore, most of them stopped operating or hoarded goods for speculation without exporting them for the time being. Cunning merchants smuggled goods to Hankou for export, which affected production and made it impossible for export trade to progress, reducing the country's foreign exchange income. China's supreme commander recently declared that in the fourth year of the war of resistance, military efforts accounted for only 30%, while economic efforts should account for 70%. This shows the importance of economic warfare, and striving to collect foreign exchange funds and encouraging the export of local goods are the main weapons of economic warfare. Therefore, it is necessary to change the commercial exchange rate in order to achieve the goals of economic warfare. (End)

### Yarn Flowers: Yarn Market Hovers Outside 1,000 Yuan Mark

The yarn market is stable, and the trend is again a hovering situation. This is because the actual sales to out-of-town customers do not see a large development, and at the same time, the foreign exchange rate is seen to be stable, so people's hearts are quiet and the rising trend has subsided again. However, the footing is very stable. If there are no unexpected changes, it is still a fundamental problem of entering and exiting the market. It is still the obstruction of the transportation lines. Therefore, it has stopped rising and is hovering outside the 1,000 yuan mark.

The yarn market opened this morning with tight sentiment, but not as tight as the afternoon market of the previous day, because the foreign exchange rate did not shrink but was rather loose. Therefore, buyers were not surging. The price of 20-count Shuangma was 1,020 yuan. After a while, those who grabbed overnight caps, seeing the poor environment, poured out one after another, falling to 1,012 yuan. Then, a certain company dragged in, and it rose back to 1,019 yuan. The closing was slightly tired. The transaction statistics for half a day show 2,140 packages. The market for 10-count Shuangma rose by 9 yuan. There were 330 pieces of cotton yarn today, and another 105 pieces of cotton cloth, shipped to Xiamen. There were 130 pieces of cotton cloth and 185 pieces of cotton yarn shipped to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows: Same trade 1,460, Hong Kong 320, Wenzhou 20, Mainland 340. Statistics 2,140

### Difficult to Expect Revival in Cotton Sales

The situation of local cotton is again on a flat path. This is because foreign cotton has returned to looseness, the overseas cotton market is sluggish, domestic yarn sales are not smooth, and yarn prices are not rising significantly, so people's hearts have become tired again. Fire engine cotton is at 151 yuan, Indian cotton at 100 yuan. Several hundred pieces were transacted. It is said that the factory's absorption has not been very prosperous.

According to another report, foreign cotton market prices are rather sluggish in the New York cotton market. All parties are taking a cautious attitude. As a result, closing prices fell by 1-2 pounds from the previous day. Indian cotton saw both rises and falls yesterday, with fluctuations of one rupee.

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai Port was slightly active yesterday, but only with Japanese manufacturers, while Chinese factories were still unusually quiet. Yesterday, the amount sold by the same trade to Japanese factories was more than 1,000 packages, but all were for one month's credit. According to the current situation, foreign cotton transactions will loosen again, because it is widely rumored that Japanese ships have stopped carrying British passengers and transporting Indian cotton.

The American cotton ship Tampa, loaded with 600 pieces, arrived in Shanghai on the 3rd of this month and stopped at the Hongkou Huashun Wharf to unload.

### Food: Foreign Rice Immediately Tires After Rising

Yesterday, foreign rice was still in a situation of first tight and then tired. At the beginning of the morning, floating hoarders and retail investors searched and grabbed in a big way. Local shop owners and general actual sales also did not distinguish between black and white and followed. Therefore, the seller's shouts arose, and the market price rose step by step, returning to the previous day's high. But once the price was raised, speculators used their tricks of capturing and releasing again. They mostly came out in large numbers at high prices, and the market was filled with goods, startling local merchants who retreated and did not enter. At this point, the sales market gradually declined, the market color returned to tired, and the price fell back. By the closing, it was half a yuan or so shorter than the previous market's closing price. If No. 1 Chen Saigon was only 58.5 yuan, and No. 2 was 53.5 yuan. However, as the international situation slightly eased and the foreign exchange rate was also seen to loosen, speculators had no way to use their manipulation tricks. Those who profited sold off quickly, and those hoarding goods also did not want to hold them for a long time, so the market fell step by step. No. 2 Siamese rice initially increased by 0.5 yuan to 63 yuan, then decreased from 62.6 yuan to 62 yuan. The opening price of No. 2 Saigon was lowered to 62 yuan, all 1.5 yuan lower than the previous day. Saigon mixed broken rice fell to 50.5 yuan in the face of the cargo party's urgent release and the waiting of the entering households, which was 2 yuan less than the previous day's 53.5 yuan. The number of transactions totaled less than 200 tons. There were also only 2,500-600 packages of current rice.

Jing and Guomi fluctuated irregularly yesterday with the fluctuations of Siamese rice in the dark market trading. The result was still flat, similar to the previous market, with no gains or losses. Changbang fresh Qingjing was 68-69 yuan, Xiqingjing was 67.2 yuan, 67 yuan, Changzhou Sukunjing was 65-66 yuan, and the next best was 62-63 yuan, Subodao was 62-63 yuan, Nangang special early rice was 65, and rice was around 61 yuan. Jinli special Yuan was 61-62 yuan, and Changdan Baiyuan was around 60 yuan, Hong Kong Baiyuan was 61-62 yuan.

Since the new Zhou Pei rice was put on the market with 25 dan the day before yesterday, the factory goods suddenly did not continue yesterday. Only 6 dan was transferred from the South City, and the price was raised by 0.5 yuan, opening at 62.5 yuan.

### Uneven Flour Prices

Yesterday's flour market situation was slightly uneven. The market price of this factory's flour stood at the original price of 15 yuan, with no changes. The number of factory shipments was still 5,000-6,000 packages, all handled by the Mujiang Street gang. However, inland flour such as Jinshan Shuangshi and other brands has successively been shipped to Shanghai, priced at only 14.2-3 yuan. Therefore, the Japanese factory's flour, the Phoenix brand, was also loose. Yesterday's opening price for this month was 14.2 yuan, and September was 14.5-4.5 yuan, which was 0.2-3 yuan less than the previous time. It is heard that the returned goods are still depreciating. As for foreign flour, the selling price was rather expensive because there were customers asking about it, such as foreign fortress Shuangying brand, etc. The previous opening price was 15.6-7 yuan, and yesterday's asking price was 16 yuan, so the market was uneven.

Wheat: There was still little change in yesterday's wheat market, because there was not much arrival in the past few days. Travelers and wheat holders uniformly held on, and Japanese factories' intake was not greedy. Chinese factories found it more difficult to sell smoothly, resulting in a continued quiet market. It is heard that the Japanese factory's intake price was around 20 yuan, and the Chinese factory's purchase price needed to add 1.5-2 yuan. The total number of those who directly delivered to the factory was only about 3,000 packages. Today, there are 100 packages of wheat being shipped to Xiamen.

### Oilcake: Soybean Cake Sells Well Domestically, Selling Price Suddenly Rises by 0.4-0.5 Yuan. Little Excitement in Raw Soybean Oil Trading.

Soybean Oil: Yesterday's oil market all stuck to the original price. Although the overall situation was that the origin was raised by German merchants (mistakenly published as French merchants yesterday) taking care of it, which affected the Shanghai market, the Shanghai inventory could still cope with current sales, so the footing was still firm. However, buying and selling were less exciting. A total of 250 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were transacted. The price is detailed in the market price column. 50 pieces of Yantai raw oil and 200 cans of canned oil, 1,500 cans of canned raw oil from Jiangbei local workshop, 250 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, 50 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil, 140 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, and 100 dan of Daya factory oil. The destinations were Jiangbei raw oil handled by Hong Kong gang, Dalian beans taken by domestic [?], and the rest were all taken by Xing [?] Benjie. Today, there are 1,200 cans of raw oil being shipped to Hong Kong, and another 760 cans being shipped to Xiamen.

Soybean Cake: Although the number of transactions was not high, most of them were actual sales in inland markets. Therefore, under the underlying trend of declining supply, its rising trend was suddenly strong. As a result, it rose by 0.4-0.5 yuan compared to the previous market. It is estimated that 1,600-700 pieces of Shengji cake were at a price of 11.4-7 yuan. 200 pieces of Qingzhong cake were at a price of 10.08 yuan. Two cars of Yuanlong cake were at a price of 11.1-2 yuan. Today, there are 6,400 pieces of soybean cake being shipped to Xiamen.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Stable

Yesterday, the trend in the sugar market turned to stability, with only a few jiao in ups and downs. The current goods of the association's marked plate were 70.5 yuan for No. 24 crude white sugar from this store and 70.02-70 yuan for foreign store goods. The transfer goods for delivery on August 15 were 55.5-55.2 yuan.
