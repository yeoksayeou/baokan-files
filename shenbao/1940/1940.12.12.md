### Song Ziwen to Swiftly Depart for London to Handle Sino-British Loan Procedures; £5 Million to Purchase Steel and Nickel from British Territories; Dutch East Indies Willing to Supply China with Oil and Rubber

London: According to reliable sources, Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Bank of China, may swiftly depart for London within days to handle the procedures for a Sino-British loan. This action follows Butler's announcement in the House of Commons yesterday that a loan of £10 million would be granted to China. Song's departure comes after negotiations in the United States have reached a significant stage. It is now known that the Chinese government intends to use part of the British loan to purchase pig iron and steel from India, both of which are essential war materials. Furthermore, it plans to purchase nickel from Canada and copper from Rhodesia. In addition, the Dutch side has suggested that the Dutch East Indies can supply China with oil and rubber. The amount of this British loan is roughly equivalent to the recent US loan of US$50 million. When Butler made the announcement in the House of Commons, he specified that Britain intends to use £5 million to stabilize Chinese finances and £5 million to allow China to purchase materials in various countries within the sterling area. Butler stated that, of course, the British government urgently needs to maintain the cash and US dollar assets possessed by countries within the sterling area to meet major wartime needs. Therefore, Britain cannot lend US dollars or British pounds convertible to US dollars to China. It can only adopt appropriate measures to limit the use of all British pounds owned by China to within the sterling area. According to this principle, the British government is willing to contribute £5 million to a fund to stabilize Chinese finances and cooperate with British territories to provide another £5 million in credit for purchasing goods from any part of the sterling area. This decision has been communicated to the Chinese government, and they have been requested to begin discussing the procedures as soon as possible and to first establish a technical plan. It is now understood that Song's trip to London is precisely for the purpose of discussing this technical plan. (Eleventh United Press Dispatch)

London: British Foreign Secretary Butler announced in the House of Commons last night that the British government has decided to lend £10 million in British currency to the Chinese government, half for export credit and half for a stabilization fund. The entire chamber cheered in unison. First, a member of the opposition Liberal Party, Mandel, spoke, asking the government to pay attention to the US loan matter and asking whether Britain would provide the same assistance to China. Butler then informed him that the government, in view of the importance of its financial and economic relations with China, has decided to continue providing financial assistance to China. He also stated that Britain naturally needs to maintain its US dollar assets to provide currency for wartime use within the sterling area and cannot supply China with US dollars or British pounds convertible to US dollars. If appropriate measures can be taken to ensure that the British pounds held by China are used only within the sterling area, the British government is prepared, in principle, to lend £5 million for a Chinese stabilization fund and, with the consent of the British Commonwealth, to provide credit to facilitate the procurement of goods within the sterling area, limited to £5 million. The British government has notified the Chinese government of this intention, saying that efforts should be made to negotiate this new loan as soon as possible to establish a preliminary agreement. (Eleventh Reuters Dispatch)

London: After Britain decided to lend £10 million to China, Chinese authorities in London warmly welcomed the move, considering the British loan as a demonstration of British and American cooperation on China and Pacific policy. The shared interests between English-speaking democracies and China, as well as the importance of China's long-term war effort, were emphasized. Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi held preliminary discussions with Keynes, financial advisor to the British Treasury, today on technical agreements. (Eleventh Dispatch)

Chongqing: After Britain lent £10 million to China, officials here unanimously praised the move, saying that the United States recently lent US$50 million to China, and Britain is now following suit. The joint assistance of Britain and the United States to China has been concretely demonstrated, and its political significance is substantial. (Tenth Havas Dispatch)

### Chinese Government's Position Strengthened; Britain Decides to No Longer Please Japan

London: The Times stated in an editorial today that the British government's announcement of financial assistance to the Chinese government in principle will be unanimously praised domestically, in the Commonwealth, and in the United States. For obvious reasons, the scope of British assistance to China cannot be as generous as the US loan last week, but this £10 million loan will have great value for the Chongqing government in terms of the goods it can purchase and as a symbol of British goodwill. The position of the government led by General Chiang Kai-shek has been strengthened by the reopening of the Burma Road and further enhanced by the withdrawal of Japanese troops from large areas of southern China. Financial assistance from Britain and the United States will further advance its progress. The Nanjing regime cannot and will never be an enemy of the Chongqing government in terms of loyalty to the great mass of Chinese people, because they all know that if the Japanese want to reduce their losses and withdraw from the Yangtze River basin, the Nanjing regime will not last long after the Japanese withdrawal. This loan to China will undoubtedly arouse the anger of the Japanese, which we may regret, but the responsibility lies with the Japanese government. They should remember that the British government once concluded a highly unpopular agreement with them to close the Burma Road, hoping that China and Japan could reach an understanding within the stipulated three-month period. The Japanese government's contribution to this agreement was limited to concluding a deal with the Nanjing regime, which only angered the Chinese government and failed to impress others. Apart from the above-mentioned events, the response to British goodwill has only been the persecution of British nationals in Japan, a campaign of insults and slanders in Japanese newspapers, and, finally, Japan's accession to the German-Italian axis. Now that Japan, as its Foreign Minister Matsuoka has admitted, has made the Three-Power Pact the guiding principle of its foreign policy, it is difficult to expect the British government to cater to its wishes and try to please it.

US Bans Steel Exports; Japan Severely Affected

Washington: President Roosevelt yesterday placed pig iron, ore sand, sheet iron, iron-steel mixtures, and certain iron and steel manufactures and semi-finished products under export license regulations. President Roosevelt telegraphed this decision to Washington from the cruiser "Tuscaloosa," as the President is currently touring US defenses in the Caribbean Sea. These restrictions on steel exports will take effect on December 30. It is believed here that Japan may be affected by this new control. Officials say that there are currently no plans for a total embargo. They say that these restrictions may be tightened in the future. Official figures on the export of these materials to Japan are currently unavailable, but according to a recent survey by a non-official organization, the "China Economic Research Committee," the United States supplies 32.5% of Japan's total iron and steel and semi-finished product imports, 98% of iron-steel mixture imports, and 91% of scrap iron and steel imports. (Eleventh United Press Dispatch)

Tokyo: According to the "Hochi Shimbun," the Japanese government has been controlling four types of iron products—nails, iron wire, tinplate, and iron cables—since last year. Due to the increasingly severe international situation and the lack of pig iron materials, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry recently extended the control measures for iron products to eight types, including pure steel pipes, iron cans, bottle caps, ship chains, hoes, iron hammers, and window frames, bringing the total to twelve types. The ministry hopes that after the new measures are implemented, these items can be distributed evenly and sold according to officially set prices. (Eleventh Havas Dispatch)

### Chinese Institute of Engineers Holds Annual Meeting in Chengdu; Chairman Chiang Sends Telegram of Encouragement

Chongqing: The Chinese Institute of Engineers is holding its annual meeting in Chengdu. Chairman Chiang sent a telegram of encouragement. The original text is as follows: To President Chen and Members of the Chinese Institute of Engineers in Chengdu, I acknowledge you all. Your association convened in Dian last year, and Zhongzheng offered several words of encouragement. It is with great pleasure that I hear this year's annual meeting is being held in Chengdu, gathering scholars from across the country who specialize in engineering to engage in research on engineering academics and careers, to assist the military and support construction. Our sacred war has reached three years, and the sacrifices and struggles of the military and civilians across the country are aimed at seeking national independence and completing the grand plan of national construction. The primary task must be to first seek the independence and progress of our country's academics and skills in order to join the ranks of modern nations. Looking back over the past year, due to the increasing difficulty of the war and the new needs that have arisen in national economy and people's livelihood, as well as the new problems and new data that have arisen in the military and economy of various countries during the European war, they must have attracted your attention and contributed to practical research. I firmly believe that in this year, our engineering science has indeed made considerable progress. In order to implement the purpose of the war, the government has instructed the responsible authorities to pay special attention to the encouragement of invention and creation. The concrete realization of this will depend more on the mutual refinement and mutual promotion of our engineering scholars themselves, in order to create a new atmosphere of catching up and not falling behind. Then our national science will be able to develop and construction will be able to progress, and the great cause of rejuvenation will be able to be completed. Accelerate the training of technical talents, actively improve business efficiency, and connect economic construction undertakings with administrative agencies, and create the progress of our country's industry by leaps and bounds. I hope you will continue to work hard to achieve all that I have mentioned to expect from your association last year. As I send this telegram, my thoughts cannot help but fly there. I sincerely wish your meeting success. Zhongzheng, True Secret. (Eleventh Dispatch)

Editorial

### Another Diplomatic Offensive

After the signing of the Abe document on November 30, world opinion pointed out that this move had no new significance. However, outwardly, it was a gesture by Japan to "end the China Incident." Logically, the next step should be the launch of a southward advance and even conflict with democratic countries. However, unexpectedly, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka released his first speech since taking office on the 9th of this month. Although he did not fundamentally deny the intention of southward advance and the delicate situation between the United States and Japan, his attitude was implicit and his tone was euphemistic, which is rare in recent Japanese diplomatic rhetoric. His reaffirmation of Japan's lack of territorial ambitions in East Asia and his new interpretation of the obligations Japan bears to the Three-Power Pact were sufficient to stimulate public opinion. It seemed that the attitude of the Japanese government, as expressed by Matsuoka, was not as worrying as the world had feared. According to news from Washington on the 10th, there were different reactions on their side. It is said that Matsuoka's speech failed to ease the firm attitude adopted by the United States toward the Pacific problems caused by Japan. Another report said that Matsuoka's expression of the flexibility of Japan's obligations to the alliance and the "peaceful nature" of its demands on the Dutch East Indies has triggered some optimism. Overall, the attitude of the US authorities has not been shaken as a result, but general sentiment has reduced some fears. Of course, this atmosphere will not have a decisive impact on the Far Eastern situation, but at least it is a new wave.

To understand Japan's political trends, it is necessary to pay attention to its entire context and historical development and never make judgments based on isolated expressions. Therefore, the first thing that needs to be clarified at present is whether Matsuoka's speech represents Japan's entire policy or only the views of himself and some government authorities. A year ago, Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura notified the United States of his intention to prepare to open the Yangtze River, which also won the favor of some Americans, but he was severely criticized in Japan, even forming one of the reasons for the collapse of the Abe cabinet. That experience should not be easily forgotten. Although Matsuoka is known as a pro-military figure, after he took office as foreign minister, especially after the Three-Power Pact aroused American criticism, his diplomatic path was not only incompatible with the so-called reformists, but was precisely following the path of Japan's old diplomatic traditions. Comparing Matsuoka's attitude in the past two months with the rhetoric of the Japanese right-wing press, it is not difficult to find the significant differences between them. Even after Matsuoka made this speech, the National News's attacks on the United States have only increased, and this fact cannot be ignored. When Konoe re-entered the stage, he did have considerable support from all parties in the military and government, but as the objective situation developed, his momentum has weakened day by day. Even the position of the cabinet itself is quite shaken, which is evident from its repeated replenishments of cabinet members and the reference of Hiranuma to join the cabinet. The fact that Konoe and Matsuoka have formed ties with the extremists and their conservative colors have become increasingly heavy is obviously not welcomed by the military right wing and the so-called reformist politicians. Therefore, it can also be seen that Matsuoka's attempt to seek US-Japan understanding is at most a kind of expectation from the conservative camp, and at the same time is what Konoe cabinet's future rests on. On the other hand, there is a significant force that contradicts this. Matsuoka's accusation that a US-Japan war is foolish is quite eloquent, but that foolish argument is currently being sung loudly in Japan. This phenomenon is particularly noteworthy.

Secondly, if we look at the evolution of Japanese politics over the past decade, whether the ruling party is composed of politicians or military men, and whether their demeanor is moderate or radical, they all have a consistent position that never changes, which is their traditional colonial policy, including the northward continental policy and the southward marine policy. Regarding the implementation of these policies, they have repeatedly declared that they have no territorial ambitions, but the actual situation is well known to the world, and there is no need to repeat it. In terms of US-Japan relations, since the unfortunate incident of the Panay, the Japanese side has been working almost all the time to ease US-Japan relations. However, what has been realized in parallel is the continuous damage to American Far Eastern interests and the gradual expansion of Japanese power into the South Pacific. In Matsuoka's speech, the explanation of the southward advance policy listed place names such as Thailand, Malaya, and Burma, expressing willingness to reach an understanding, but did not mention the Philippines and Vietnam separately, probably because the former is too stimulating to the American public, and the latter has become a fact, and there is no way to hide it any further, but these two regions have already been placed by Japan into the "Co-Prosperity Sphere" long ago. On October 4 and 5, both Konoe and Matsuoka gave speeches that were not averse to war with the United States. If it were not for the United States tightening its embargo and aid to China, and the situation in the Mediterranean war developing in a direction unfavorable to the Axis powers, I am afraid that the attitude of the Japanese authorities would still be the same as it was two months ago, and they would definitely not even want to evade the obligations of the alliance. Moreover, with regard to the Far East issue, Britain has clearly taken the same stand and consistent attitude as the United States recently, while Japan is solely concerned with easing relations with the United States and hardly pays any attention to Britain. This point is also worth pondering.

Although the Japanese authorities have now clearly stated that they are unwilling to share the fate of the Axis powers, this is actually just a kind of temptation and even a disguised threat, and it is by no means enough to represent everything on the Japanese side today. The development of the Far Eastern situation is by no means merely tied to the momentary diplomatic posture of the Japanese government. Only the attitudes of the various powers involved and the evolution of the European war are the important factors that determine this issue. In reviewing the high-sounding diplomatic rhetoric that Japan has made throughout its history, Matsuoka's talk yesterday, apart from his subjective hope that it would have a kind of anesthetic effect and become a new kind of diplomatic offensive, actually has no new significance at all.

(3) On the night of the 9th of this month, the Vietnamese Air Force, in retaliation for Thai aircraft bombing Savannakhet twice, flew to Udon Thani, Thailand, regardless of the adverse weather. After identifying the airfield, they dropped multiple bombs, totaling 3,500 pounds, and distributed a large number of leaflets. At that time, several fires were observed in the field. (4) At 5:00 AM today, Thai artillery again fired thirty shells at Savannakhet, causing no damage.

Also, well-informed sources here stated that the Vietnamese authorities have not changed their attitude towards Thailand and are still willing to continue negotiations according to past policies, but any hostile actions will be met with the same retaliatory measures. At present, communication between the French Embassy in Thailand and Vietnam is cut off, all due to the Thai authorities' deliberate severance of all communication between Thailand and Vietnam in recent days.

### Greek Army Launches Second Phase of Offensive on All Fronts in Albania; Pressing Italian Troops, Leaving Them No Room to Breathe; Port of Palerma Captured by Greek Army Yesterday

Athens - The Greek government issued an official announcement stating that the Greek army began the second phase of operations against Italy yesterday. Soldiers on the front lines are pursuing Italian troops across the entire 150-mile front without rest. Italian troops are retreating north from the Argyrokastron area and from the coast towards the Himalayan Mountains. Italian rear guard units are resisting Greek troops with fierce fighting to prevent the Greek army from pursuing them, suffering heavy losses. It is believed that the first phase of the war has achieved initial success in a very short period of time. Now, a second phase of the offensive must be launched immediately, without waiting for the 80,000 reinforcements sent by Italian Commander Soddu to join the front lines. It is claimed that the Greek army is currently examining the large amount of equipment abandoned by Italian troops in Delvino. The war zone has a treacherous climate, with heavy snow and hail, but this is not enough to deter the bravery and determination of the Greek army. It is now planned to press forward in one go, without giving the Italian army a chance to reorganize. Foreign reporters also reported that Italian troops attempted to hold their positions north of Delvino, but eventually collapsed. Recent reports indicate that the entire right wing of the Italian army retreated in disarray after losing Argyrokastron. There was fierce fighting north of Pogradec yesterday, and Italian troops along the coast also retreated to the port of Durazzo. (11th United Press dispatch)

### Greek Reinforcements on the Northern Front; Fierce Fighting in the Pogradec Area

London - A Reuters special correspondent on the Yugoslavian-Albanian border reported that the Greek army continued to fiercely attack the left flank of the Italian army yesterday on the northern part of the 80-mile Albanian front. The Greek army first bombarded with heavy artillery, then advanced north of Mount Mokra under the cover of machine guns and mortars, with the aim of forcing the Italian army to retreat to Librazhd. The Italian army launched several counterattacks, but the Greek army has now assembled strong reinforcements, apparently wanting to force the Italian army to abandon the positions they hold in the Pogradec area. It is reported that the Italian army resisted fiercely, but the outcome of the battle is still unclear. Further south, the Greek army continued to advance slowly, step by step, regardless of the mortar fire of the Italian army, the difficult mountainous terrain, and the adverse weather. The Greek advance in the north is aimed at the Shkumbin River valley and will soon face the extremely strong Italian positions in Librazhd. Fierce fighting is also taking place in the Moscopole area. The Italian army has launched many ineffective counterattacks. (11th Reuters dispatch)

### British Launch Offensive on Western Egyptian Frontier; British Forces Advance 75 Miles; Armored Units Assisted by Air Force; Break Through Strong Italian Coastal Positions; Fighting Ongoing Southeast of Barrani

London - After British armored units broke through the Italian lines in the western Egyptian desert, it is rumored that they have now cut off the communications of part of two Italian divisions at Sidi Barrani. The attacking British forces are composed of British, Dominion, and Free French troops. At dawn on Sunday, a surprise attack was launched on the Italian army along a 30-mile front. In less than 36 hours, they reached the coast between Sidi Barrani and Buq Buq. During the British advance, British aircraft constantly bombed Italian communication lines to hinder their reinforcement operations. British aircraft tactics varied, either flying low and dropping tons of bombs or using machine guns to strafe the enemy. The clear moonlight lately is what stopped Alexandria from being attacked by Italian aircraft. This must be because the Royal Air Force is assisting the ground forces in their advance. The Italian forces under General Graziani's command in North Africa seem to be stationed in the Solum area bordering Egypt and Libya. This British offensive was carefully prepared behind the lines for several months. Therefore, from the British headquarters in Cairo to the various British forces in the Middle East along a 400-mile front in the desert, adjustments have been made and perfect actions are being taken to quickly advance to the coast, cutting off the communication between the Libyan Italian forces holding Sidi Barrani and the several Italian divisions supporting them from the west. The area occupied by the Italian army is roughly an equilateral triangle, with its three points being Sidi Barrani, Mersa Matruh (15 miles east along the coast), and Nibeiwa (15 miles south of Sidi Barrani). On Monday morning, the British army occupied the barracks at Nibeiwa, capturing 500 people. While the Navy bombarded one side of this triangular area, the British armored vehicles, assisted by infantry, attacked the other two sides. The Royal Air Force also cooperated closely, constantly soaring over the entire area, bombing Italian positions, destroying motorized transport teams, and breaking through enemy formations. It is rumored that the British army has so far captured more than 4,000 Italian troops and seized several medium tanks. British forces in the Qalabat area, with the assistance of artillery fire, are continuing to patrol the desert. The difficulty of this can be imagined. There are no orchards, food storage, livestock, or water plants in the desert, so the troops cannot obtain supplies in the occupied area, and every drop of water and every bite of food must be carried by the combat troops themselves. The difficulty of desert warfare was already demonstrated by the Italian invasion of Egypt this year. The Italian army was well-equipped and was able to quickly advance to Sidi Barrani, but its mobility was soon eroded by a sea of yellow sand. (11th Reuters dispatch)

London - A Reuters military correspondent stated that British forces in the western Egyptian desert have advanced 75 miles in one go, attacking the Italian army. The attacking British forces under General Wavell are mostly cavalry regiments in armored vehicles who go straight in and control the enemy. They have encountered at least two divisions of the Italian army under General Graziani's command and defeated them. These Italian forces held barracks in two areas, with strong defenses, but this British offensive has reached the seaside west of Sidi Barrani, and they are now encountering the main force of the Italian army. This group of Italian troops is well-equipped, with tanks and artillery. It has been building roads and stockpiling food, water, and ammunition for six months. The Libyan Italian army consists of three parts whites and two parts natives. Most of the natives are Libyans. Those in the front lines are mostly dead or captured. Therefore, the Italian white troops will now have to meet the British Empire's first-class troops composed of Australian, New Zealander, British, and Indian troops on the battlefield. (11th Reuters dispatch)

London - A Reuters special correspondent with the British army in Egypt reported that fighting is now taking place near Daqahsaia, fifteen miles southeast of Barrani. The village was subjected to heavy bombardment by the British fleet at the beginning of the battle. If the British army holds the positions in Buq Buq behind Barrani, then the route of retreat for a large number of Italian troops may be cut off. According to a British military spokesperson, the current battle is still in its early stages and has been extremely successful so far. (11th Reuters dispatch)

### British Air Force in the Middle East Establishes a Record of Achievements

Cairo - The British Air Force Command issued a communiqué stating that, according to the detailed report of the British Air Force assisting in the offensive, on the first day of the offensive, the British Air Force heavily bombed the enemy's airfields from Tobruk to Sidi Barrani, causing heavy damage. In addition, British aircraft constantly attacked the enemy army and motor transport teams concentrated in the combat area. It is rumored that 22 enemy aircraft were shot down or destroyed, 18 of which have been confirmed, and 4 others have not yet been confirmed. One British aircraft team shot down 11 of them, 4 of which were burned on the ground at the same time. Another British aircraft team carried out a low-altitude strafing, causing heavy damage to enemy communications and casualties. Subsequently, British aircraft reconnaissance reported that large fires had broken out in several places west of Buq Buq, and enemy motor transport vehicles were also burning on the roads, causing the enemy army to become disorganized. British aircraft carried out these extensive aerial activities from dawn to evening. Only three aircraft did not return to base. The pilots of two of them have been rescued in British-held territory. (11th Reuters dispatch)

Cairo - The British Air Force Command issued a communiqué last night stating that the Rhodesian British aircraft team flew to Italian East Africa and attacked the garrison positions northeast of Kassala, inflicting heavy damage. Another aircraft from the team bombed the enemy army and motor transport teams on the road between Mitan and Gondar to the southeast, causing heavy casualties and damaging a considerable number of motor transport vehicles.

### English Prime Minister Reports on War Situation in the House of Commons

London – British Prime Minister Winston Churchill stated last night in a packed House of Commons that the British and Free French forces had advanced 75 miles in the desert, successfully concluding the initial stage of their military operations in this time of national crisis. The Prime Minister also recalled that months ago, he had explained to Parliament the threats to British positions in the Middle East following the collapse of France. However, when Secretary of State for War Eden visited the Middle East, reinforcements had arrived and were under the command of Middle East Commander-in-Chief General Wavell, sufficient to resume the offensive without worry. When Italy invaded Greece, the British Air Force in Egypt had to send several squadrons to aid the Greek forces. The victory of the Greek forces owes much to the British Air Force. However, the British Air Force in Egypt was temporarily reduced, and the offensive plan was implemented more slowly. On the night of December 7th, the large British and allied forces began to advance towards the Italian positions. (Reuters, 11th)

### Egyptian War: Italian General Killed in Action

Rome – The Italian High Command announced on Wednesday noon that in the early hours of Monday, British armored divisions attacked Italian positions southeast of Barrani.

The Blackshirt Division and the Libyan Third Division fought bravely. General Maletti was killed in action during this battle. During the battle, Italian aircraft also sortied to provide support. There were no major developments on the Greek front. (Haitong, 11th)

### Germany Declares Large-Scale Blitz Offensive Against Britain Imminent, Claims European War Can End Soon, British and German Air Forces Conduct Retaliatory Bombings

Berlin – German Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels told foreign journalists yesterday that Germany would launch a massive blitz offensive in the near future, the ferocity of which would be unprecedented, bringing the fifteen-month European war to a swift end. This statement seemed to echo Hitler's speech yesterday, which stated, "Strike Britain daily until they sue for peace." The foreign journalists listening to Goebbels came mostly from Paris. Goebbels predicted that Britain's total defeat was imminent. He said, "In reality, we already feel that Germany has achieved victory, so Germany is now only focused on building a new European order. Germany is willing to establish cultural and economic relations with other places in the world, including America, which is what we desire most in our hearts." Goebbels then compared the English Channel to the Maginot Line, saying that Germany, after thorough preparation and detailed planning, could capture it as easily as turning one's hand. He also compared Churchill to former French Prime Minister Reynaud, saying that both knew that France could not resist a strong enemy, yet took a desperate gamble, and even deceived their people with lies of victory before their defeat. Goebbels also called such people similar to boxing match managers who know that their own fighter will be knocked down, but still claim that he will win. Goebbels called Britain "a nation that only knows how to eat butter and doesn't know how to make cannons." Now, even butter is unavailable. The German people have sacrificed butter for seven years to build the world's strongest army. (United Press, 11th)

London – After two days of quiet, London issued an air raid warning again this morning, but it was very brief. The only place where enemy aircraft were active in the evening was East Anglia.

(Reuters, 11th)

London – An Air Ministry communique stated that British bombers heavily bombed a factory in La Lys, the Lorient naval base, and the docks of Bollogne on Monday night and Tuesday morning. British aircraft shot down one German aircraft. One British aircraft also did not return. German-occupied ports in France attacked by the British Air Force were on fire and burning fiercely. This morning, the sky over the English Channel was illuminated by the fire, all red. Subsequently, large fires broke out along the French coast, with flames soaring and thick smoke billowing, creating a spectacular sight. The area within and around Calais was ablaze. (Reuters, 11th)

Berlin – The German war report this afternoon stated that the weather was bad yesterday and last night, and German aircraft operations were limited to reconnaissance.

### Soviet Union Warned Germany Regarding Balkan Ambitions, Germany Abandoned Plan to Attack Greece Via Bulgaria, Widely Believed to Be Due to This

London – According to a highly reliable official source in a special report by the International News Service yesterday, the Soviet Union has sent a diplomatic note to Germany warning the Nazi government that if German troops attack Greece or Turkey via Bulgaria, the Soviet Union "cannot but be concerned." Germany seems to have decided not to send German troops through Bulgaria to aid Italy in attacking Greece, and this is widely believed to be the reason. The International News Service reporter also said that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's recent visit to Berlin represents the biggest setback in German diplomacy in five years. It is reported that Molotov's visit to Germany was to declare the Soviet Union's will to Germany, rather than a convergence of the wills of the two countries. It is also said that although the Soviet Union seems to condemn Germany, Soviet-British relations may not necessarily improve as a result. The Soviet Union only recognizes that relations between the two countries "have not reached the worst stage." It is said that the Soviet Union holds this view because Britain seized ships in British ports belonging to the three Baltic states after the Soviet Union annexed them. (International News Service, 11th)

Ankara – Local political figures here are unmoved by Hitler's speech in Berlin yesterday, and are paying close attention to the British offensive in Libya, believing that the British offensive indicates that the tide of the war has begun to turn against the Axis powers. Senior Turkish political figures recently predicted that Germany may use the winter months to engage in building and consolidating its economic structures in the territories it occupies and controls. Turkish officials also said that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has made it clear to the Nazis that the Balkan people have sufficient strength to deal with Germany and the Soviet Union, so the Soviet Union is unwilling to hand over the Balkans to Germany. Turkey's only option at present is to maintain a large armed force throughout this winter to maintain security. (United Press, 11th)

### Hungarian Foreign Minister to Visit the South, Countries Repair Old Ties, Will Sign Friendship Agreement

Budapest – Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky left the capital at 11 o'clock last night on a regular express train for a return visit to the capital of Yugoslavia. Accompanying him were a large number of important officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. German Minister Erdmannsdorff and Italian Minister Barramo were at the station to see him off. Diplomatic circles here believe that the restoration of friendship between Hungary and Yugoslavia will lead to the signing of a treaty of friendship, non-aggression, and mutual consultation. Last night, the newspaper "Új Nemzedék" stated that the Foreign Minister's visit to Yugoslavia marks a new era in Hungarian-Yugoslav relations and a significant page in the Axis powers' policy of pacifying Europe. (Haitong, 11th)

Capital of Yugoslavia – Responsible figures here said that the impending signing of a friendship agreement between Hungary and Yugoslavia is of great significance, and that the territorial disputes between the two countries that have existed since the Treaty of Trianon in 1920 will therefore come to an end. According to the Treaty of Trianon, the regions of Banat and Bačka in Hungary were ceded to Yugoslavia. Although the majority of the residents in these two regions are Yugoslav Serbs and Croats, they still include 680,000 Hungarian minorities. Therefore, Hungary's demand for the return of the lost territories has never ceased in the past twenty years. All powers wishing to exert pressure on Hungary or Yugoslavia have used this issue. (Havas, 11th)

Csáky Issues Statement Before Departure

Belgrade – Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky, who left the Hungarian capital last night to visit Yugoslavia, issued a statement to Yugoslav correspondents, discussing relations between Hungary and Yugoslavia. Csáky declared, "The political nature of my visit to Yugoslavia is undeniable. Hungary and Yugoslavia today both recognize that relations between the two countries are not merely the result of reciprocal visits by politicians; rather, the visits are merely a manifestation of the friendship between the peoples of the two countries. Hungary and Yugoslavia have been friendly nations for centuries, and their foundation is mutual respect. Hungary's foreign policy is a policy of peace, which is also the ultimate goal of my trip." (Haitong News Agency, 11th)

Hungarian and Yugoslav Newspapers Express Similar Sentiments

Budapest – Newspapers here view Foreign Minister Csáky's visit to Yugoslavia as a turning point in the international situation in Southeast Europe. Hungarian-Yugoslav relations have improved. The Axis powers encourage Hungary's policy of peace. Csáky's visit is part of the Axis powers' plan for Southeast Europe. (Haitong News Agency, 11th)

Capital of Yugoslavia – Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky will arrive here today for a visit to Yugoslavia. Yugoslav newspapers have published lengthy biographies and recent photos of Csáky and Hungarian Regent Horthy on their front pages. The newspapers vigorously argued that the restoration of relations between Yugoslavia and Hungary began after Horthy's speech in Máchács in 1926. The friendship between the two countries lies in maintaining peace and promoting sincere cooperation between the two countries. (Haitong News Agency, 11th)

### Cooperating with Britain in the War, President of Chang Hing Company Details Contributions to Britain

London – Sir David Beatty, President of the Chang Hing Shipping Company, recently sent an article to Reuters, detailing the company's contribution to the British Empire's war effort. He said that the company's current policy is to wholeheartedly cooperate with the British and Canadian governments to conduct the war, not only to the extent of its usual activities, but also willing to expand its scope to the production and machinery required for the training and equipping of modern armies. At the beginning of the war, the company was prepared to meet all needs, and the efficiency of transporting troops and materials is improving daily. Recently, the Canadian Minister of National Defence expressed unlimited admiration for the company's handling of troop movements. There are almost no restrictions on the various conveniences and facilities for handling traffic, so there is no congestion. In addition, considerable success has been achieved in the speed of transport. The company's ships occupy an important part in the war activities of the merchant fleet. As one of the representatives of Canadian-British shipping affairs, I know very well the glorious achievements of the merchant fleet, but I cannot disclose them. However, I can say that the company's ships have sailed into enemy territorial waters, transported troops back and forth in various parts of the Empire, and transported enemy prisoners to Canada for detention. All the staff of the company are willing to work, struggle, and sacrifice their lives for their freedom, and sacrifice their money and happiness. The current war is a war of free people, and I firmly believe that free people will achieve the final victory. (Reuters, 11th)

A Painful History of the European War (5)

### The Truth About Britain and France's Hasty Entry into the War

Hitler took Chamberlain to his bedroom, accompanied only by the translator Schmidt. The room was very small, with only an iron bed inside. A very exquisite painting, sent from the Munich Museum and changed from time to time, hung on the wall. When Hitler spoke, he was truly eloquent, never stopping, leaving no room for interruption. Chamberlain could only stare blankly at him, speechless.

Chamberlain also told me that when he met Hitler for the second time in Godesberg, Hitler was still speaking non-stop, like a river bursting its banks. He thought that even if such talks continued, they would be useless. Moreover, every few minutes, an officer would come in to deliver a telegram—this was clearly a planned scheme. After reading it, Hitler would roar in uncontrollable anger: "The blood spilled by the Germans must be avenged, the Czechs must be annihilated!" His rage was constantly increasing. Whether he was genuine or not, he said to the translator: "It's better to stop the conversation, I'm going back to the hotel." The hotel was on the other side of the Rhine River, so he had to take a boat. When he said goodbye, Hitler continued to roar and escort the guest until they reached the riverbank. Suddenly, he stopped speaking and immediately changed his expression. Looking at the river under his feet, he said in a very gentle voice: "I originally wanted to show you the beautiful scenery on this river, but now it is covered by fog…" His ability to transform, one moment as angry as thunder, the next moment gentle and refined, changing so quickly that he seemed like a different person, was truly something never seen before.

A member of the Foreign Office who accompanied Chamberlain to Germany told me that the Prime Minister was deeply pained by these two talks. Hitler's rage was something he had never seen in his life. Therefore, if someone mentioned Hitler's name in front of him, he would show an embarrassed face, like a child being forced to drink castor oil. But on Chamberlain's part, he believed that he had an unshirkable responsibility to preserve peace, and he always hoped to fulfill his wish.

He received countless letters from men and women in Britain and France, which increased his faith. Thousands upon thousands of rural women in France sent him letters of thanks, thanking him for saving the country from war, families from bombing, and children from death. There were also many old women who knitted gloves with woolen yarn and sent them to him, with shaky, large letters saying: "Prime Minister, wearing these gloves will keep your hands from getting cold when you are on an airplane." All these expressions touched Mrs. Chamberlain infinitely. She was a kind-hearted woman and strongly urged her husband to continue on the path of appeasement.

After the Munich Conference, this path of compromise was no longer supported by the British people. Originally, the British army and air force were unprepared, so public opinion had no choice but to accept the results of the Munich Conference. But the British Empire had tasted bitterness and knew that this matter was somewhat dishonorable, so it resolved never to submit to humiliation again, regardless of any sacrifice. In January 1939, I went to Britain to attend a series of meetings, traveling almost all over the island. I realized that British public opinion was more advanced than the government. Although Britain urgently needed to implement conscription, the government was still hesitant, but the people were actively demanding it. British people all over Britain, regardless of gender or class, told me: "We can never allow Hitler to rule Europe, and we must build a large army and a strong air force."

When I returned to Paris, I wrote an article saying that Britain would implement conscription in March. At that time, many French friends said that I was a fool talking in my sleep. They said that compulsory military service violated the traditional habits of the British people and that the British would never adopt it. But in March 1939, Britain did indeed implement conscription.

When the German army invaded the Czech city, Chamberlain and the leading figures who supported the policy of appeasement were dealt a heavy blow. The shock of this British Prime Minister was not contrived. He had always firmly believed that Hitler would never annex non-German races, but now he had received evidence to the contrary. He suddenly changed his plans and turned into a strong opponent of Hitler. He was filled with shame and anger and, unexpectedly, gave Poland a guarantee. At that time, I was in the United States, and upon hearing the news, I said to myself, "This will inevitably lead to war." On the one hand, Germany would continue its ambition to expand its territory and would inevitably annex Poland; on the other hand, Britain would never abandon the solemn treaty it had signed, as it had shown throughout its history. With each side going to extremes, the war could not be averted.

Britain suddenly found itself in a situation of complex European entanglements, and it had no choice but to have a closer understanding with France. In June 1939, the Anglo-French alliance held a formal banquet in Paris, attended by British Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha, French Foreign Minister Bonnet, and General Gamelin. Hore-Belisha declared on the spot that once war broke out, the British army would be under the command of the French commander-in-chief, and that he would be fortunate enough to say, "Our General Gamelin." As soon as he finished speaking, applause erupted and lasted for a long time, but General Gamelin remained silent. After the banquet, Hore-Belisha and we went to the Polish Embassy, where a dance party was being held. Hore-Belisha's trip was nothing more than to show that Britain and Poland had a new bond.

Every time I recall this experience, I cannot help but feel sad. It was midsummer, and the night was intoxicating. In the garden of the Polish Embassy, ​​white marble sphinxes shone under the stars, the orchestra played waltzes, and the lights were brilliant. On the lawn, many beautiful girls were dancing with Polish and French officers. The two daughters of the German ambassador were also among them. We all believed that war was imminent, and Poland would bear the brunt. This dance party seemed similar to the dance party held by Wellington in Brussels on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo! That night, the guests raised their glasses, talked and laughed, and discussed unrelated trivia. They talked about the maiden voyage of the Pasteur, and several people who were preparing to go to South America used their travel plans as conversation material.

A few days later, Hore-Belisha came to Paris again, accompanied by Colonel ——, his adjutant, to prepare to watch the French National Day parade on July 14th. Churchill was also traveling with him. That day was a grand occasion and the last day of joy in Paris. The French army had never had such a magnificent military appearance. Inspected were light cavalry, light infantry, naval infantry, foreign legions, and regular troops. Everything that was glorious in France was revealed in this grand review. Churchill smiled and said, "Thank God, France actually has such an army." At that time, who would have thought that that kind of morale, discipline, and the reputation of the best army would be rendered useless due to insufficient mechanical equipment! At that time, the tanks meandered along, and the viewers were moved, but they did not understand the situation in Germany. Who knew that Germany had more tanks, thicker armor, and could not be subdued by French artillery!

That afternoon, Hore-Belisha and his adjutant, Colonel ——, came to Neuilly to see me. He told me about the various difficulties he had encountered in training the British army.

He said, "Conscription is indeed good, but now it is just empty words and has no practical effect. Although many people are registered, they have neither equipment nor officers to train them, so there is no way to gather them together for training."

I asked, "Where have the officers from the Great War gone?"

"They don't know how to use new weapons!"

"If war breaks out tomorrow, how many divisions can you send to help us?"

"Immediately? I'm afraid it won't exceed six divisions."

This number startled me. Soon I learned that the French General Staff had requested only thirty-two divisions from Britain during the entire European war, which shocked me even more. I recalled that in 1918, in addition to the Allied Powers of the United States, Russia, Italy, and Japan, the British army had 85 divisions participating in the war. France's victory was still a narrow one. It is no wonder that it caused my surprise. At that time, the Foreign Office feared Bonnet's opinion and agreed with me. I retraced the following event to him: (To be continued) The grand occasion on the Champs-Élysées in Paris before the war.

### American Recognition of Hitler's Remarks: No Less Than Admitting Defeat in the Invasion of England; Aimed at Stimulating Domestic Morale; To Endure Sacrifice in Continued Struggle

Washington: It is reported here that individuals recognize Hitler's speech near Berlin yesterday as nothing less than an admission of the failure to invade England. Observers here believe that the purpose of Hitler's speech was to reassure German public opinion, fearing that the failure of the blitz against England and the defeats of Italy would discredit him. Observers also believe that Hitler's speech was an open admission that there is no hope for peace negotiations in the near future. The mention of the United States in the speech was aimed at stabilizing domestic morale and preventing panic due to active American aid to England. Commentators also pointed out that Hitler's speech did not mention a single word about Italy's failure in the war of aggression against Greece. (United Press dispatch, November 11)

Washington: It is reported here that Hitler's remarks in Berlin yesterday had a dual nature: one was a provocative speech to munitions workers, and the other was a challenge to all countries around the world, whether belligerent or not, that oppose Nazi economics. Hitler's declaration of war on capitalism anywhere in the world was directed specifically at Britain and the United States, and he acknowledged that although the United States is not a belligerent, it is in fact backing Britain in the war. The need for German workers to hear this lengthy and provocative speech is also considered noteworthy. (Reuters dispatch, November 11)

New York: German leader Hitler told the German people yesterday that if the Germans win, the world will belong to them. Hitler's lengthy speech from the top of the steel platform in a Berlin armaments factory clearly indicated his intentions and goals after a victory in the air war against England, with a clarity unmatched by previous speeches. Hitler said that gold would become useless and worthless, and that aristocratic politics would be swept away in Germany, replaced by labor politics. Most of Hitler's speech was to assure the German people that the hardships and sacrifices they had endured in the difficult years before the war, and in the months when Hitler believed that British bombing had affected the German people, would definitely be rewarded. However, what is significant is that Hitler's speech was broadcast by radio throughout Europe, to strife-torn Romania, to ambiguous Bulgaria, to Southern countries fearing the ravages of war, and to every household throughout Germany. To the residents of continental Europe, Hitler announced the goals of the war; to England, he announced that the end was near. In the past, when Hitler made speeches, except when speaking to his old comrades in Munich, he almost always led the German people in making statements to the parliaments and political giants of various countries. However, Hitler's speech yesterday was definitely directed internally, intended to inform the masses of the Nazi Party that there were rich rewards of fame and fortune under the bombers. Germany's war against England has been ongoing for years, and its people must constantly be stimulated and encouraged so that they can continue to fight. However, Hitler's promise to his people that their sacrifices and efforts would be compensated is still a first. Since the beginning of the war, Hitler has only made empty threats and boasted that he would immediately defeat England and all of Germany's enemies. However, it should not be ignored that Hitler reportedly planned to have lunch at Buckingham Palace between August 15 of this year, and had told his confidants that he would taste the experience when the time came for him to cross the sea to his liking.

### British Wartime Damage Compensation Law
Detailed Rules Have Been Announced

London: The detailed rules of the new parliamentary bill stipulating compensation for war damage to various properties were announced today. The application of this bill is quite mechanical, but it is based on three plans, including three major categories of property as follows: (1) houses, land, and other real estate; (2) machinery, office equipment, and other movable property in commercial organizations; (3) personal property such as furniture, etc. (Reuters dispatch, November 11)

### Full Text of Hitler's Speech
(Continued from Previous)

We have such firm confidence in the final success of national armaments. If my waiting for the opportunity can reduce sacrifices, then the whole country will definitely be able to express understanding and gratitude to me. We are not attacking for prestige. We have a certain military procedure. What should be done first is done, and what should not be done is avoided. However, we still hope that there will be a time to restore reason, restore peace, Germany will not be defeated militarily or economically, time is not harmful to Germany, Germany will definitely win. There is no word of surrender in my dictionary. I am not afraid of fighting. As long as I have a breath left, I will swear to continue to the end.

Hitler then recounted the course of the National Socialist Party's revolution, saying that when the National Socialist Party's revolution was launched, we had two major goals: one was to unify the German nation. We must first achieve this goal before we can realize the demands vital to Germany's survival. In 1932, Germany had eight million unemployed workers, insufficient food and clothing, and many deaths. The National Socialist Party struggled to unify the German nation, overcoming many difficulties, initially with the resistance of the intellectual class of the upper class. This could not be resolved by force. At that time, I realized that it was necessary to restore the society of the German nation before this could be done. So I moved towards the set goal. The second was to eliminate the oppression of foreign politics, which is the Treaty of Versailles. The treaty prevented the unification of the German nation and deprived Germany of its colonies. Therefore, our second goal was to fight against the Treaty of Versailles. Hitler said to this point, then put forward democratic politics, saying that the democratic politics of Britain and the United States are almost entirely monopolized by capitalists. Hundreds of capitalists who own countless properties, their so-called freedom, not only refers to obtaining capital, but also implies being free from national control. Each capitalist competes to publish newspapers, creating public opinion to promote its policies, and represents various political parties. This is called democratic politics. In this country of freedom and wealth, there are both the rich and the poor, which is hard to believe. The class division in Britain is extremely strict, and the contrast between the rich and the poor is also very obvious. I have never seen them take any solutions. In countries that control the world's wealth, the living conditions of workers are even more unbearable. Although the country is rich and prosperous, the unemployment problem has not been solved. Even in wealthy Britain, there have been 2.5 million unemployed, and this has often been the case for decades. In the wealthy United States, the number of unemployed often ranges between 10 million and 13 million. France also has no less than 800,000 unemployed. The facts are there, what else can be said? Labor Party members in the British cabinet once said happily, "This will engage in socially valuable undertakings after the decision of the war. British workers will have the ability to travel and be idle." Little did they know that Germany had already solved this problem. Often, a small number of rulers are selfish and self-interested in their hearts, but they use democratic principles as a banner. They know very well that we will not harm their cloth countries. What they fear is that if the ideals popular in Germany are not rejected, they will flow into their country, reforming the people's ideas, making them unwilling to obey. In short, in the capitalist world, there is one most important economic law: people must work for industry and commerce. As for the operation of industry and commerce, it is to seek the welfare of capitalists. As for national socialism, it is the opposite. The people are the most important, and everything else is just a tool to achieve the goal. I myself am not interested in high profits. A 6% interest rate is not too little for anyone. The British also said, "We are fighting to maintain the gold standard." Little did they know that the Germans also once possessed gold. After I took control of the country, because there was no gold in Germany, I became isolated from the gold standard and changed my concept, taking our working ability as gold. Although our mark has no gold as its backing, it is still always stable because its labor is its backing.

Hitler continued, "All those who have the intention to abolish national socialist countries and destroy the German nation are now beginning to be taught a lesson. For example, Poland initially wanted to subdue Germany. As a result, it was conquered by Germany in eighteen days. It was decided that Britain had an attempt to invade Norway, and then the war on the Western Front broke out. Our army launched an offensive. At that time, the old people in our country were half suspicious and fearful, thinking that the Maginot Line was indestructible. As a result, the war ended in six weeks. I do not intend to carry out night raids in the air war. Therefore, during the war in Poland, German aircraft did not go on night raids. The purpose of the German air force's operations was to attack military targets, not to harm civilians, women, and children. Therefore, night raids were not carried out during the war in France. However, Churchill adopted unrestricted air force tactics against Germany, but as a result, German factories did not suffer any losses. Those who suffered were the unfortunate civilians. There is no shortage of idiots in the world who think that Germany will be in turmoil and disintegrate. Little do they know that the Third Reich is far from the Second Reich. We are fighting for the future, for the happiness of all the people. We already have concrete plans. The state organized by the German people will become more consolidated. Any obstacles that hinder the development of talented people will be eliminated. We are determined to establish a socialist country. We will not consider it a success until we achieve our goal. At that time, we will show the world which is the true master: capital or labor." Hitler concluded, "It is more difficult to be the leader of Germany from an unknown soldier and to seek peace than to have the qualifications of the leader of Germany. What is there to fear if the goal is achieved?" (Haitong News Agency dispatch, November 10)

### Fourth Shenbao Cup Sino-US Charity Basketball: Chinese Team Roster; Chen Xianglong, Li Zhenzhong and 14 Others; Concentrating Shanghai's Elite, Strong Strength

The Fourth Shenbao Cup Sino-US Charity Basketball Tournament, jointly organized by Shenbao, the English-language Great American Evening News, and the YMCA, has been scheduled for the 17th, 19th, and 21st of this month (i.e., next Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday) at 8:00 PM in the YMCA gymnasium on Jing'an Temple Road. The selection of the Chinese team has attracted much attention from all parties. In order to take into account the actual difficulties, the organizing authorities decided to invite Chen Xianglong, Li Zhenzhong, and 14 other players by Shenbao to represent the Chinese team, and hired Zhou Jiaqi, Ling Xitao, and Qian Xucang as consultants to the Chinese team, and Lu Zhongen as the manager of the Chinese team. According to Shenbao Cup, the American team won the cup last year. This year's Chinese team is full of talent, concentrating the elite of all Shanghai Chinese teams, and will definitely win glory for the country, make a good start, and win back this glorious cup. The full team roster is listed below:

(Consultants) Zhou Jiaqi, Ling Xitao, Qian Xucang (Manager) Lu Zhongen (Players) Chen Xianglong, Li Zhenzhong, Lu Zhongen, Chen Xuechong, Feng Nianhua, Ren Xiangcheng, Zhang Shaoqing, Bao Songyuan, Sun Huipei, Liang Yunming, Lu Gusui, Wang Nanqun, Wang Nanzhen, Chen Bangzhen.

### 13th YMCA Basketball; Scheduled to Open Next Monday Evening; Youlian Basketball Team Withdraws, Leaving Only 10 Teams; Opening Game Baillemon vs. Shangxing

The 13th YMCA Invitational Basketball League has been scheduled to open next Monday (the 16th) evening. The registration results from the previous week showed that 15 teams participated: Baillemon, Huaxing, Huxing, Liangxi, Youlian, Blue Team, Shangxing, Huabu, Zhongyi, Tianxing, Xiaoxiong, Juren, Mailing Military Officer, Mailing White Team, and Mailing Red Team. Later, Huabu, Zhongyi, and Tianxing and other three teams, their strength did not meet the standards. The review results only approved 12 Chinese and Western teams to participate. Now Youlian due to small formalities and incomplete, and the Blue Team due to insufficient players announced their withdrawal one after another. Therefore, the YMCA basketball, originally limited to 12 teams, now has only 10 teams competing. Among these ten strong teams, Chinese and Western teams are evenly divided, and their strengths are also comparable. Therefore, the performance of this year's YMCA League is expected to be more exciting than previous years. This year's Western teams, the strength of Mailing White is still better than Mailing Red. The military officers are also very strong. Xiaoxiong has Carson's assistance and is obviously extraordinary. The giants are just so-so. On the Chinese team side, Huaxing appeared as a dark horse, with both voice and appearance. However, it is still uncertain whether Cai Yanxiong and Zhou Daxiao can come to Shanghai. Wang Nanzhen and Nanqun brothers are still playing for Liangxi. On the Huxing side, the loss of Chen Xuechong will naturally have a great impact. Shangxing's strength is still at the standard. Although Baillemon lost Li Bao, talents can still be deployed and still maintain its status as a giant. This year's YMCA ticket prices are one yuan upstairs and two yuan downstairs. The first four weeks of the order are recorded below:

### The Catholic Church in China; Overview of Five Major Cultural Undertakings (5); (3) Xujiahui Observatory

In the 17th century, the history of Catholic missionaries taking turns entering astronomy is well known to modern people. Anyone who has visited the Forbidden City Museum will definitely remember the astronomical instruments made by Nan Huairen and others. In modern times, science has become more advanced, and the Catholic Church's scientific research has not allowed others to excel. The Catholic Church believes that researching science is to seek truth, so religion and science complement each other and there is absolutely no conflict.

The establishment of the Xujiahui Observatory dates back to the twelfth year of Tongzhi (1873), and it has been 67 years since then. At that time, the Shanghai International Chamber of Commerce requested Father P. Dechevrens to set up an observatory to predict hurricanes because ships entering and leaving often suffered from wind disasters. Father Wen immediately agreed, only asking for free telegrams to be sent to various observatories.

After Father Wen, the successors were Father Cai P. Chevalliee, Father Lao P. Froe, and the current Father Yan P. Lejay. The current organization of the Xujiahui Observatory can be briefly described as follows: Director Father Yan presides over everything, but because he often has to go out to test the earth's gravity (Father Yan invented the earth's gravity testing pendulum, which helped the Chinese government with land surveying and mapping, with excellent results), he does not spend much time at the station. Under the director, there are Father Zhong Qianmao P. Dumas, Father Long Pherzi, and Father Bu P. Burgand of the Xujiahui Meteorological Station, who are responsible for climate, earthquakes, electromagnetism, and timekeeping, respectively. Father Wei P. do Lovielemerque of Sheshan Observatory is dedicated to astronomy. The electromagnetism department was originally also set up in Xujiahui. Later, Shanghai laid trams, which had an impact on the magnetic force, so it was moved to Luxiabin in a few days in the third year of Guangxu (1877). After the August 13th war, it was moved to Sheshan again. Therefore, the Xujiahui Observatory, which is commonly referred to today, actually includes Xujiahui and Sheshan. Strictly speaking, Xujiahui is a meteorological station, and Sheshan is a true astronomical observatory.

The most important work of the Xujiahui Observatory is meteorological reporting, which includes standard time and earthquakes. Meteorological reports are published four times a day, but more than 200 reports are received every day. The reporting agencies can be divided into land reporting stations (such as Chinese coastal customs reporting stations, domestic government reporting stations, and foreign reporting stations) and active reporting stations of marine merchant ships and warships. There are more than 50 land reporting stations. In the event of a hurricane, warnings will be issued on the Bund of the French Concession. In the past six or seventy years, the number of Chinese coastal hurricanes that have occurred has totaled more than 1,000, and the number of warships and merchant ships that have been saved from disaster is countless. The letters of thanks and commendation, souvenirs, etc., received by the observatory are also difficult to enumerate. The late Father Lao also had the title of "Father of Hurricanes." The observatory also has two new-style timekeeping instruments. The temperature and pressure of the storage place are specially designed and cannot be changed. Therefore, the timekeeping error cannot exceed one-hundredth of a second per day. At noon and 9:00 PM every day, the time is broadcast by radio. In October of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the International Astronomical Association also designated Africa's Yalki, the United States' San Diego, and Xujiahui as standard timekeeping locations. The Xujiahui seismograph was established relatively late, but the equipment is extremely sophisticated. There are one Wieehert horizontal seismograph and one Galitzin vertical seismograph each. Therefore, Xujiahui's earthquake research also occupies an important position in the world. In the past ten years, the prediction of the two major earthquakes in North China has been the most important record.

The Sheshan Observatory was founded in 1900 and is equipped with two equatorial instruments with a length of seven meters and a lens diameter of 40 minutes, one for observation and one for photography. The successful work of the Sheshan Observatory over the years has been the study of sunspots. It has taken 12,000 photos and determined the positions of 14,000 celestial bodies, studied 1,200 binary stars and clusters, and calculated more than 100 instances of Jupiter disrupting the orbits of other planets. The reason why the Sheshan Observatory has achieved this result is that its Wangda telescope can increase the light of the fourth magnitude by a full twelve degrees of light. The personnel of the Xujiahui Observatory have also made several inland exploration trips and explorations of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and have drawn 54 maps and determined the locations of 50 cities. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, at the request of the Chinese government, Father Hui's invention of the earth's gravity testing instrument was brought from Shanghai to Guizhou for testing. At that time, many highways had not been completed, but they were finally able to overcome the difficulties and finally succeeded. In recent years, the newly established Nantong Observatory, Qingdao Observatory, and Central Meteorological Observatory in China have either been assisted by the Observatory in installing and constructing equipment or trained personnel. The contribution to modern science in China is by no means insignificant. Those who say that religion hinders thinking and prevents the progress of material civilization can realize this.

### Foodstuffs A Large Shipment of Foreign Rice Arrives Yesterday, Severely Impacting Speculative Trading, Market Prices Show Slight Decline

Yesterday, a large quantity of foreign rice arrived. The French company's postal ship "Dat De Nan" was confirmed to have directly loaded 7,000 tons from Saigon, as reported earlier. It is now known that the ship arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday and docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. It carried over 71,500 bags of foreign rice, which are currently being unloaded. Furthermore, Jardine Matheson's "Yusheng" ship brought 2,091 bags from Hong Kong, and the "Fusheng" ship also brought 1,459 bags from Hong Kong. Both ships arrived yesterday morning and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. The "Fusheng" ship had an additional 1,125 bags to be transshipped to Qingdao and another 239 bags to be shipped to Tianjin. Additionally, Taikoo's "Taiyuan" ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and also carried 989 bags from Hong Kong, docking at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. Unloading was completed yesterday. The amount of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai yesterday was substantial.

Since the rice market experienced price limits and subsequent declines, the market sentiment yesterday remained weak. Most people still aimed to sell quickly. Therefore, the market opened weakly. General speculators competed to sell, but buying interest was lacking. Not only were shops hesitant to make actual purchases, but speculative trading was also quiet, resulting in a lack of counter-offers and falling prices. However, it was difficult to attract buyers because the market had been excessively inflated previously, and a sudden decline was bound to be severe. As a result, the market continued to weaken. According to statistics, at the close, foreign rice prices were more than 1.5 yuan lower than the previous session. For example, No. 1 Saigon was sold for 85 yuan but dropped to 83.5 yuan, No. 2 was 78 yuan but dropped to 76 yuan, No. 1 Siam was 80 yuan but dropped to 79.3 yuan, No. 2 was 76 yuan but dropped to 75.8 yuan, Xiaojiao was 75.5 yuan but dropped to 75 yuan, Milu was 72.8 yuan but dropped to 72 yuan, Broken Rice was 70.05 yuan to 68 yuan, and Wuchao Jian was 75 yuan but dropped to 73 yuan.

Thick and thin Jing Guomi (polished rice) saw sluggish sales as most customers refrained from buying due to the continuous decline of foreign rice prices. Selling prices continued to drop by about 1 yuan. Kunshan Jian Baijing opened at 95.5 yuan but dropped to 92 yuan, Jiate Jing was 98 yuan, and Thin Dao Yuanbao was 92-93 yuan, Jian was 88 yuan, 87 yuan.

Glutinous rice followed the trend of other goods, declining by more than 1 yuan. Yi Li Baiyuan was 95 yuan, 93-94 yuan, Hong Kong Baiyuan was 85 yuan, 82 yuan, and Nuolu was 74 yuan to 70 yuan.

### With the Arrival of Foreign Flour, Flour Prices Gradually Soften

Wheat flour prices softened yesterday. The No. 2 Flour Mill's price remained at 18 yuan, and over 6,000 bags of regulated-price flour were allocated according to regulations. With the current abundance of foreign flour, local customers mostly shifted to foreign flour. As a result, the local flour market had been sluggish for some time. However, yesterday, rice prices continued to fall, and news of the imminent arrival of the third batch of Australian flour spread widely. The market sentiment was weak and unstable. Returned goods, such as Bell Tower Flower and Bird Brand Australian flour, were sold for only 19.8 yuan, down another 0.1 yuan from the previous day. Road transport transactions also gradually became sluggish. The total market transaction was only over 1,000 bags. It is heard that a total of 300,000 bags of Australian and American flour will arrive this month. At that time, the future of rice flour is expected to be suppressed.

Wheat remained sluggish yesterday. Only 200-300 bags of domestic wheat arrived daily, all designated for delivery to Japanese factories. Although the price of stored goods in the concession reached 30 yuan, there was still a lack of supply. Chinese factories and customers, seeing the declining situation of foreign flour, were reluctant to purchase. Therefore, the market entered a stalemate again.

### Finance Foreign Exchange Meanders

Foreign exchange market conditions: The HSBC's listed prices did not fluctuate. The black market exchange rates for British and American currencies remained unchanged. The trend has consistently meandered between 5.9375 and 5.96875 for US dollars, which has been the case for some time. This is because political and other news are insufficient to stimulate market sentiment. Speculators have disappeared in the past two days. However, the Bank of Japan continued to offer, and Chinese banks also sold. The American banks and foreign banks had relatively strong demand. The market eventually recovered from loose to stable. As a result, the British and American exchange rates remained uniformly unchanged at 5.9375 and 3.765625 respectively. Swap rates also remained flat.

Uniform and Indistinguishable

In the early morning, the London exchange rate for both near-term and long-term was 3.1875. The New York silver price remained flat, and the London gold price remained stable. The exchange rates for British, American, and Shanghai currencies were all flat, and the exchange rates for American to British and Shanghai currencies also did not change. The central bank's listed exchange rates, such as banks, began selling spot goods. The exchange rate for British gold was 3.765625, and the exchange rate for US dollars was 5.9375, which was the same as the closing market price last night. After the opening, the market was stable with a firm undertone. This was because the Bank of Japan began to sell. It is estimated that Anda Holland and Youli absorbed the US dollar for the current month at 5.96875. HSBC's listed price remained unchanged. The silver balance tax was increased by 1.00%. Later, the Chinese Commercial Bank also intended to sell, selling the US dollar for the current month to the American Bank at 5.96875. By noon, the American Bank's demand was not weak, and the potential returned to equilibrium. The noon closing prices for spot British gold were all 3.765625, and the US dollar was 5.9375. Compared to the previous day, the exchange rates for both British and American currencies were indistinguishable. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Hong Kong Exchange Rate Stable

Hong Kong, November 11 (Wednesday) Telegraph: The exchange market opened flat today. The exchange rates for British, American, and Japanese currencies did not fluctuate. The spot exchange rate for Shanghai dollars decreased by 0.5 yuan to 396 yuan. At 10:30, it was stable. The spot exchange rate for Shanghai dollars increased by 1.5 yuan to 397.5 yuan. At 11:30, it closed flat. The spot exchange rate for Shanghai dollars decreased by 0.5 yuan to 397 yuan. The rest remained unchanged. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Tianjin Market Also Unchanged

Tianjin, November 11 (Wednesday) Telegraph: The exchange market opened sluggish today. The telegraphic transfer rates for London and New York did not fluctuate. The Shanghai exchange rate also remained at the original level. Only the black market exchange rate for "United Currency" was slightly lower by 0.25 yuan, at 88.75 yuan.

### Economic Miscellany

— Feng Liutang

Dry Tobacco (2)

There is a saying that "Little Tartars knock on damp tobacco." In the early years, there were clay sculptures on the market depicting Qing officials with short beards, holding pipes, and smoking, which were used as toys for children. This shows the popularity of smoking among the Manchus. Among the Han Chinese, during the Kangxi period, Prime Minister Chen Yuanlong of Hai'ning and Prime Minister Shi Yizhi of Liyang were both known for smoking, which was even spread by the Qing Shengzu. Because Chen and Shi were related by marriage and both enjoyed smoking, the Shengzu disliked it and gifted them crystal pipes. They were delighted, considering it a special honor. However, when they used them to smoke, the smoke went straight to their throats, causing them to choke so much that they dared not smoke again. The Shengzu also issued a ban on smoking. Jiang Tingxi wrote a poem about it:

Green bowls and jade ladles wash open,

Feasts have already forbidden deep cups;

After the Yaochi banquet, the cloud screens open,

No human smoke is allowed to come.

However, those who banned banned, and those who smoked smoked. Judging from the shortage of coins during the Yongzheng period, it can be seen that the trend of smoking was still prevalent at that time.

At that time, each coin weighed 1.4 qian, and the lightest was 1 qian. One tael of silver could only be exchanged for 840 cash. Melting it into copper, the heavy ones weighed more than 7 jin and could be sold for 2-3 taels of silver to make bronze ware. At that time, many people used tobacco pouches. Although the item was small, destroying 10 coins could make a tobacco pouch worth over 100 coins. Dishonest people could make a profit of ten times, so melting coins to make tobacco pouches was common. However, these so-called tobacco pouches were not water pipes but dry pipes, so they only weighed a little over one tael. However, it is enough to prove that there were many smokers, even affecting the coins.

During the Qianlong period, the most famous smoker among the court officials was Ji Xiaolan, known as "Big Pipe Ji." His pipe was very large, and one pipe of tobacco could be smoked from home to the court. One day, while on duty and smoking, he suddenly heard that he was summoned. He hurriedly inserted the pipe into his boot, rushed in to report, and after a long time, the fire burned his socks. In great pain, he couldn't help but sob. The emperor was surprised and asked him. He replied: "There is water running in my boot," because Northerners call fire "running water." He was quickly dismissed. By the time he took off his boot outside the door, the smoke was billowing, and his skin was scorched.

As for wealthy families at that time, such as the Jia family in the Dream of the Red Chamber, smoking was rarely seen. Only in chapter 101, Xue Baochai handed Sister Feng a bag of tobacco. This bag was definitely dry tobacco. However, in The Gallant Maidens and Knights, which depicts the families of banner people, Madam An smoked constantly, and Zhang Jinfeng and Aunt Chu also smoked. This shows that banner people liked to smoke the most, and the trend of smoking had become popular among the people. There were even officials who could not do without tobacco. For example, when Liu Wending of Wujin was down on his luck, he was so poor that he was starving. He begged for tobacco from his neighbor with a bamboo pipe. The neighbor mocked him, saying, "Tobacco relieves hunger, don't eat too much." He smiled and accepted it, mocking him for being hungry and smoking, which would only make him hungrier.

Tobacco pouches were made of various materials, including pure copper, pure silver, ivory, ebony, rosewood, rattan, and bamboo. However, metal pouches easily conduct heat, wooden pouches easily break, rattan is upright but too soft, and ivory is good but not durable. Silver and copper can only be used to make small pouches and do not easily absorb tobacco oil. Therefore, bamboo is the most suitable for dry tobacco pouches. First, it is long and thin. Second, it is straight. Third, it does not break easily. Fourth, the pipe wall easily absorbs tobacco oil. Generally, those who use bamboo or wood to make tobacco pouches use copper, ivory, or material for the mouthpiece, which varies. However, the bowl at the bottom for burning tobacco must be made of copper. When smoking dry tobacco, the mouthpiece is held in the mouth. Metal is durable, but it is too hard and easily damages teeth. Therefore, ivory is the most suitable because it is hard but flexible. When holding tobacco in the bowl and removing the remaining ashes, it must be tapped, so even using metal is still easily corroded. In the old days, a sachet or a lacquered wooden tobacco pouch was hung on the pouch to store tobacco. However, the simplest way to smoke is to use a thin bamboo tube, only about a foot long, with the nodes removed. One end is carved into a small funnel shape to hold tobacco. When smoking, one hand holds the pipe between the index and ring fingers, and the other hand picks up tobacco leaves between the thumb and index finger. The other hand uses the two fingers to take tobacco, blow paper to ignite the tobacco (paper blows are also called coal heads, which are made of熟paper rolled into strips, easy to blow with coal), blowing, sucking, and tapping leisurely, making viewers envious. This is what is meant by knocking damp tobacco (to be continued).

### Gold Market Reverses

Yesterday's spot gold market reversed its previous stable trend, with a slight downward trend. Due to the firm opening of the foreign exchange market, a selling trend was triggered, pushing the price down to 5,748 yuan at one point. Later, as the foreign exchange market stabilized, bargain hunters came, and short sellers covered their positions, pushing the price up to 5,777 yuan before closing. The final price was 5,773 yuan, down 13 yuan from the previous day. Xianshan Yuhao offered 40 taels of silver, 9 yuan lower than the official price. Later, the silver shop offered a large amount of 20 taels, 10 yuan lower. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. Only 2,000 taels were traded in half a day. The price of gold in silver shops remained unchanged, and the price of customs gold was flat.

Spot Gold Plunges

The morning was most embarrassing for the bulls. The opening price was pushed down by more than 30 yuan. The silver shop matched 20 taels at 5,750 yuan. Before long, the silver shop continued to match 20 taels, falling another 2 yuan to 5,748 yuan, a complete collapse. However, soon after, hearing that the foreign exchange market had stabilized, the buying sentiment slightly moved, and the gold shop also took advantage of the cheap price to buy in. Qian Duiye Silver Shop jointly purchased, pulling the price up to 5,777 yuan, with the Silver Shop entering Qian Duiye for 30 taels. Afterwards, trading was scattered, and the noon closing was average. The Silver Shop matched 10 taels at 5,773 yuan. As a result, the price fell by 13 yuan, with a fluctuation of 29 yuan in half a day. The selling price of spot gold in the brand name of the gold shop was more than 10 yuan higher than that of spot gold, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower. The current bid gold was 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little activity.

### Miscellaneous Grains Floating Speculation Seeks to Emerge, Futures Oil Falls Back Three Yuan, Large Quantities of Miscellaneous Grains Shipped to Hong Kong

Yesterday's oil market, first, because the spot market was sluggish and the market price was humiliated, resulting in half of the interest being hit, and secondly, the rice price was loose again, the soybean market was mediocre and lacked spirit, the people's hearts were inevitably floating, and the general speculation of grabbing hats sought to emerge, so the selling wind was strong, and the market price was downstream, resulting in the near term falling by nearly three yuan from the previous day, and the far term falling by two yuan, a total of 30 pieces of spot Yantai soybean oil were traded, and the price was 78.5 yuan, Dayou factory soybean oil was 100 dan, the price was 85 yuan, Jiaozhou Xinsheng oil was 200 pieces, the price was 83 yuan, Qingdao raw oil was 80 barrels, the price was 112 yuan, 2 jiao to 110 yuan, a total of 50 barrels of Dalian soybean oil for delivery in December, the price was 108 yuan, a total of more than 1,200 barrels of Qingdao raw oil for delivery in December, the price was 113 yuan to 110 yuan, a total of 900 barrels for delivery in February, the price was 110 yuan, 2 jiao and 5 fen to 109

### Securities Bullish Emerge, Domestic Debt Depressed, Foreign Debt Rising Power Still Strong

The securities market still failed to continue its upswing yesterday. Although there was a large amount of absorption by buyers, sellers continued to supply, causing the market price to fall instead of rise. It can be seen that large bullish holders have been seeking a way to emerge, and they have been selling off whenever there is a large exchange demand. Therefore, the future may not be easily excited for a while. The continuous success of large loans has not helped the price of government bonds. Contrary to the previous usual practice, there must be a period of excitement whenever a loan is established. Yesterday, Shanghai Da Yisheng bought more than 700,000, and Dazhonghua, Yizhong, Shunkang also absorbed 200,000 to 300,000. Maoyi, Dahong, and Dazhong also bought in a lot, and there were still scattered buyers buying in an endless stream. However, sellers Lianyi, Datong, and Lianhe continued to supply in the morning and evening, and the amount supplied by Yu Rutongji, Shuntai, Sankai, Wanchun, Yitai, Xiexing, and Yuanyuan was no more than the same, so the market price was still from high to low, and there was no upswing. As a result, Fuxing fell back to 5 fen, 1 jiao to 2 jiao and a half, and the total number of transactions was 1.56 million yuan. A simple table is listed below.

Stock trading, 200 shares of Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory stock were traded, and the price was 29 yuan, 2 jiao and a half.

Also, the stock market of Zhongye Gongsuo opened still quiet, and the people's hearts were slightly better after entering, but the transaction was still sparse, and there was no special change in price worth mentioning, only the Xinhuo stock once rose to 8 yuan and 6 jiao, and at the same time, the plush stock at 6 yuan and 8 jiao cattle, the price can also stand firm,

London, 10 (Tuesday) Telegraph, Today, the listed market prices of Chinese foreign debts and Far East British companies, Chinese foreign debts, and the previous stall market were strong, and the market was up by 2 pounds to 5 pounds, a total of Chrispo rose by 5 pounds, the price was 25 pounds, the British-German renewal loan (British hair) rose by 3 pounds and a half, the price was 42 pounds, the British-French loan (British hair) and the good loan (British hair) each rose by 2 pounds, the British-French was 45 pounds, the good was 33 pounds, the railway bonds in the later stall, only Guangjiu rose by 1 pound, the price was 13 pounds, the rest remained unchanged, Stock bank stocks continued to improve, HSBC bank stocks rose by 1 pound again, the British registered stock was 77 pounds, the Hong Kong registered stock was 80 pounds, there was a line and no market, and the United Bank rose by 5 shillings, the price was 10 pounds, 12 shillings and 6 pence, and there were no other changes,

### Yarn Cotton Profit Taking Sales, Yarn Market Rising Wind Has Been Determined, Single Yarn Hong Kong Sales Not Weak

Shuangma Chen opened, because the popularity in the afternoon of the previous day was unusually enthusiastic, and the first plate continued to move forward, the price of 20 Shuangma was 1,290 yuan, at this time the buying sound vibrated, and in a short time it rose directly to 1,297 yuan, but on October 22, the peak had reached 1,302 yuan, and some speculators saw that it had not yet broken through, so it might as well spit out the bullish, and then returned to 1,280 yuan, but the price was fatigued, and the buying wind rose again, and it rose to 1,296 yuan, but the second time it failed to rise out of the customs, so the users who grabbed hats sold out one after another, and the market continued to decline to 1,281 yuan at the close, but the big households had absolutely no abandonment concept, and if the price was low, there might be a move to increase the code, the daily transaction statistics were 4,710 bales, and the market 20 Shuangma was not much different from the previous day, and the amount purchased by each gang mouth is listed as left,

### Chinese Constables of Various Police Stations in the French Concession Requested Improved Treatment Yesterday - Approximately 1,000 Chinese Constables Briefly Went on Strike - Service Resumed as Normal After Discussions - The French Consul-General Promised to Provide Satisfactory Answers to the 17 Items Requested

Following the satisfactory resolution of the issue of Chinese constables in the Public Concession requesting improved treatment, all Chinese constables in the French Concession, due to meager income and difficulty in maintaining a living, also made a verbal request to the French authorities to increase the salaries of Chinese constables. 150 people from the Lukiawan Police Station were the first to go on strike at 8:25 AM yesterday. Other Chinese constables from police stations such as Songshan Road and Dazimingzhong, as well as the reserve team vehicle department, responded one after another upon hearing the news. 1,400 Chinese constables stopped working, causing the French Concession Police Commissioner Fabre and Deputy Commissioner Blanczy to immediately summon the Chinese constables from the Lukiawan Police Station for talks. Three representatives of the Chinese constables submitted the terms of the request. Fabre expressed his willingness to study them and promised to give a satisfactory answer within three or four days. The Chinese constables were satisfied and, considering the importance of public security, collectively returned to their posts at 10:00 AM, and traffic order was also restored. The details are as follows:

French Police Deployed to Maintain Traffic

After the Chinese constables went on strike at 8:00 AM yesterday, traffic on the roads of the French Concession was quite chaotic for a time due to the lack of personnel to direct it. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, a large number of private cars traveled eastward on Avenue Joffre to offices and shops in the Bund area. This was a common phenomenon, but because most of the traffic lights on Avenue Joffre were unattended, the line of cars stretched for hundreds. At the same time, trams and rickshaws also moved in succession, which was very slow, and the noise was mixed, which was very close to Shanyin Road. Later, employees of the tram company and French patrols were dispatched to direct traffic at various intersections, and order was gradually restored. However, because there were not enough people, they seemed quite busy. Some silver shops and large stores on Avenue Joffre and Avenue Foch closed their doors after hearing that the Chinese constables were on strike to prevent unexpected events, while other stores were not affected.

French Defense Forces Join Patrols

After the Chinese constables went on strike, the French Concession authorities, fearing problems with public security, immediately ordered all French defense forces, French expatriate volunteer corps, and reserve patrols to mobilize immediately, deploy to important locations, and patrol Avenue Joffre, Avenue Foch, and other places in groups of five, searching pedestrians and vehicles. Annamese and White Russian patrols were assigned to perform the work left by the Chinese constables. French police chiefs rode motorcycles around the roads, and armored vehicles patrolled everywhere, which was very busy. However, because the number of French and Vietnamese police officers was small, their strength was still very weak. However, residents of the French Concession were especially careful, so no unexpected events were heard. The French and Vietnamese military police who were deployed were still patrolling after the resumption of work and were demobilized in the afternoon.

Authorities Guarantee a Satisfactory Answer

After the strike occurred, French Police Commissioner Fabre and Deputy Commissioner Blanczy convened the Chinese constables of the Lukiawan Police Station for talks at 8:45 AM. 120 Chinese constables attended. Fabre announced that the French Concession authorities were paying close attention to the lives of Chinese constables after the recent price increases and were considering ways to improve the situation. He hoped that the Chinese constables would submit their requests. The Chinese constables’ representatives 158, 164, and 598, immediately submitted the terms. Fabre said that he was willing to guarantee that he would give a satisfactory answer to these conditions within three or four days and hoped to return to their posts immediately to ensure public security. The Chinese constables were satisfied and immediately resumed their duties. In the early morning yesterday, a Chinese constable propagandist was arrested by White Russian detectives while propagating the strike on Route Ghisié de Viliers and Route Massenet, but was released before the resumption of work.

Seventeen Requests Made in Total

The seventeen requests made by all the Chinese constables are as follows: (1) Request the establishment of a French Concession Chinese Constables Mutual Aid Association; (2) Request to set up a Chinese Constable General Patrol office in the Central Police Station; (3) A minimum salary of 60 yuan, 5 dou of rice subsidy, a special allowance of 30 yuan, a housing allowance of 18 yuan, and double pay at the end of the year according to the official salary; (4) Savings funds remain the same, with an annual seniority wage increase of two yuan; (5) If a constable's gun is stolen, those who have been dismissed should not be required to pay for the gun; (6) The reserve class should prepare for 24 hours according to the old rules; (7) The uniform should be changed to Western style, and black leggings should be used in winter and summer; (8) Inspections of uniforms and drills should be held twice a year; (9) The detective department is short of personnel and should be selected by Chinese constables through examination; (10) Each person should be issued a Chinese constable certificate, and amusement parks, trams, and parks should be free of charge; (11) The chief room should not be prohibited from going out except on special Chinese commemorative days and French National Day; (12) During work hours, if there are day shifts, night shifts should be canceled, and evening shifts should be double-posted for joint patrols; (13) Chinese constables who are heavily fined or dismissed must have the signature of the Chinese Constable General Patrol; (14) Velvet blankets, underwear, and mats must be issued by the police station; (15) Establish a school for the children of Chinese constables; (16) Give one month of official leave each year, with salary paid as usual. If a patrol is punished, the holiday should not be deducted without authorization; (17) Chinese constables should not be pursued for paying "official business" on a monthly basis.

Declaring Absolutely No Other Purpose

According to the Chinese constables, the strike yesterday was purely due to the inevitability of life. The salary of Chinese constables is only 24 and a half yuan per month, with another 5 dou of rice subsidy and a subsidy of 17 yuan, 1 dime and 5 cents, but the total is only 74 yuan. At a time of such drastic price increases, it is obviously impossible to maintain a family life. The grief should be understood and sympathized with by all citizens. The order for each Chinese constable to pry open 15 vehicle notices per month is particularly painful.

### Japanese Troops Stabbed Farmers for No Reason

The Mainland News reported that yesterday (the 10th) at 5:00 PM, a Chinese farmer was suddenly stabbed in the buttocks by a Japanese soldier with a bayonet while walking across the Yichang Road Bridge. The wound was quite deep. Passersby called for a fire department ambulance and sent the farmer to the hospital. On the way, they were stopped by a Japanese sentry for a long time.

### Municipal Council Police Officer Beaten - Formal Protest Lodged - To Be Delivered to the Japanese Side This Morning - Searches Continued in the Western District of Shanghai Yesterday

According to foreign sources, the Shanghai Municipal Council had not yet lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities regarding the case of a Chinese police officer of the Police Department being beaten by Japanese military police yesterday. According to a spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council, the protest will likely be lodged with the Japanese side this morning by Chairman Silas Aaron Hardoon.

Municipal Council Meeting Decides to Negotiate

Regarding the infringement by Japanese merchant buses of the Shanghai Municipal Council's licensed traffic business rights in the extraterritorial area of ​​Western Shanghai, Council Chairman Silas Aaron Hardoon had already lodged a protest with Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai Horinouchi Kensuke the day before yesterday, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to reporters from Da Zhong News Agency, when the Municipal Council Board held its regular meeting yesterday afternoon, the incident was reported. It was stated that after investigation by the Japanese Consulate, the Japanese Consul stated that the operation of Japanese merchant buses in Western Shanghai was a private matter and that the Japanese government was not aware of it. After discussion, the directors decided that in addition to the administrative authorities conducting negotiations based on reason, Japanese directors should also be entrusted to investigate the truth of the matter.

Rickshaw Licenses Still Awaiting Report

The English-language "The China Press" stated, "It is understood that regarding the recent case of a Chinese police officer of the Police Department being beaten and humiliated by Japanese military police, it is expected that Shanghai Municipal Council Chairman Silas Aaron Hardoon will formally lodge a new protest with the authorities of the Japanese Consulate today (the 11th)." As for the "notice" recently issued in the Western District that rickshaws on extraterritorial roads will be forced to pay for "Municipal Council" licenses starting on Monday, the Municipal Council is awaiting a formal report from the Police Department this morning. A certain Chang of the Municipal Council stated that he could not comment on the latter issue until he received a report from the Police Department.

No Signs of Lifting the Blockade

The situation in the blocked area of ​​Western Shanghai remains calm today. Officials stated yesterday (the 10th) that they believed the restrictions would be lifted on Saturday and Sunday. However, there were no concrete signs of the restrictions being lifted in the area this morning. Japanese merchant buses continue to run on Yuyuan Road, and Japanese military police and conscripted police are still conducting strict searches in the area.

News Vendors Detained and Not Released

Rumors that the Japanese side prohibits newspapers from being delivered to the blocked area and opened near residents were denied by Japanese officials this morning. It is said that Chinese people carrying parcels are subject to searches, but newspapers are allowed to be sent into the blocked area. However, according to Chinese sources, several news vendors were detained at the Japanese Military Police Headquarters on Route Dufour yesterday for delivering newspapers to the blocked area, and have not yet been released today. At the same time, Shanghai Municipal Council Chairman Silas Aaron Hardoon protested to the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai yesterday regarding the operation of Japanese buses in the Western District, and is awaiting a reply today.

### Youth Association Members and Families Gather to Sew Winter Clothing; Participating Men and Women Enthusiastically Collaborate, Hoping the Association Will Continue Fundraising to Achieve Full Success

The Shanghai Youth Association's fundraising for winter clothing to aid freezing, suffering children has been previously reported in this newspaper. We now learn that the Association has successively received hundreds of pieces of new and used clothing donated by warm-hearted individuals from all walks of life, as well as over eight thousand yuan in cash. They are proceeding to purchase cloth and cotton to begin sewing, and have explored continued fundraising and various related matters, as detailed below:

Volunteer Sewing

The Association meticulously considered and established detailed methods for sewing winter clothing in advance, emphasizing educational significance. On a recent day, the Association invited members' families to the meeting to volunteer sewing. Simultaneously, the China Underwear Company donated an electric cutter and two tailoring technicians, while the Singer Company lent six sewing machines. Electric cutting was immediately put into use, proving to be very efficient. Hundreds of pieces of clothing material were cut in a short time, with uniform sizes. In addition, tasks such as folding cloth, operating the sewing machines, spreading cotton, stitching, attaching straps, and printing were divided and collaborated on. Participating men and women were extremely enthusiastic. Each garment, besides the outer layer, contains one "shi jin" (approximately 1.1 pounds) of cotton, with labor and material costs totaling 3.50 national currency.

Continued Fundraising

The Association believes that the current collection of clothing, including those being sewn, amounts to only over two thousand pieces. The number of suffering children in Shanghai is vast, and with the imminent arrival of severe cold, the supply is insufficient. The Winter Clothing Committee of the Association decided to continue fundraising. The method involves printing a kind of three-yuan winter clothing receipt, distributed to Association members for endorsement. Subsequently, committee members will individually conduct fundraising. To encourage participation, the top five fundraisers will be awarded prizes to show recognition. Furthermore, to seek broad public donations, the Association has specially made over ten donation boxes for suffering children, planning to display them in prominent locations in major stores and cinemas before Christmas, requesting donations. There are many kind-hearted and charitable individuals in Shanghai, and it is hoped that substantial donations will be easily obtained.

Distribution Methods

The Association's committee, noting that in past years, winter clothing distributed by various charitable organizations in Shanghai during winter was often pawned by recipients or distributed unevenly, leading to numerous abuses. As a result, genuinely poor and suffering individuals could not receive practical benefits, while cunning individuals would fraudulently receive several pieces, reselling them repeatedly, wasting the sincere efforts of donors, which is very regrettable. The Association now plans to use scientific methods to conduct on-site investigations in impoverished areas, collecting statistics on the family circumstances of each suffering child. Those who are most impoverished and suffering will be selected for distribution. Each winter clothing item will be specially printed with the red characters "Winter clothing for warmth, not accepted for pawning," so that the funds are not wasted and the effort is truly effective.

Youth Association Members and Families Volunteer to Sew Winter Clothing

### Muslim Graves in Zhenru Excavated, Causing Outrage Among Believers

Muslim representatives in this city stated to reporters yesterday that the Japanese "Central China Railway Company" is currently excavating Muslim graves in the Zhenru area. This matter has caused indignation among all Muslims in this city. It is reported that there were originally hundreds of Muslim graves in that area. After the Japanese excavated them, they merely erected a small tombstone on the original site, stating that it was once a burial ground for Shanghai Muslims. Recently, the Japanese authorities criticized the graves in the Zhenru area for hindering the development of railway branch lines. Therefore, disregarding appeals from Muslim groups around the world, they proceeded to excavate. Muslims had previously proposed changing the route to bypass the burial ground, but to no avail. The Muslims here do not intend to protest this matter, knowing it would be futile.

### Detained Crew Members from Dinghai Arriving in Shanghai by Ship in Succession

Passengers on foreign ships such as Moufu, Haifu, Feikang, and American Da Sheng, which were detained off the coast of Dinghai Toutougang Nianmudun, have successively transferred to ships returning to Shanghai. The shipowners have also separately negotiated with the Japanese army in Dinghai, but they all claimed that it must be decided by the Japanese army in Shanghai, so there has been no result. Now, some of the crew members, because they have been detained for a long time, a few have also taken ships to Shanghai.

### President Jackson Arrives in Shanghai This Morning on Round-the-World Voyage; No Tours Due to Unusual Circumstances

The American Mail Steamship Company's newly completed President Jackson, on her maiden voyage from New York via Los Angeles, San Francisco, Honolulu, and various locations in Japan, is scheduled to arrive here this morning at 7:30, docking at buoys 14 and 15. Only sixteen passengers will disembark in Shanghai, while fifty-four will remain on board for the round-the-world voyage. Passengers arriving in Shanghai will transfer to small ferries and disembark at the New Customs Wharf at 9:00 a.m. The ship originally intended to offer tours to the public, but due to the unusual circumstances, the order was temporarily suspended by the head office. After staying here overnight, she is scheduled to set sail eastward tomorrow morning, passing through Hong Kong, various locations in Southeast Asia and India, rounding the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, crossing the Atlantic Ocean, and returning to New York. The last ferry will depart from the New Customs Wharf tomorrow morning at 1:00 a.m. (i.e., midnight tonight). In addition, the company's old round-the-world mail ship, President Van Buren, is also scheduled to arrive in port at noon today, scheduled to dock at buoys 12 and 13. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the same day as the new ship President Jackson. It is reported that this ship will transport a large batch of goods from the United States, amounting to 3,000 tons.

### 70,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Imported Yesterday, Rice Price Inflation Slightly Abated; French Consul-General Optimistic About Vietnamese Rice Supply, Rice Dealers Express Dissent Regarding Transaction Methods

The French mail ship, the D'Artagnan, arrived from Saigon via Manila yesterday morning at 10:00, docking at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. Passengers and luggage were transported to the New Customs Wharf by ferry at 11:30. Among the passengers were thirteen members of the Vietnamese mission to Japan economic delegation. In addition to seventy-four passengers, the ship also carried a large quantity of mail, goods, and over 71,500 bags of Vietnamese rice, ordered from Saigon by the relevant parties in this city. It is expected that the inflationary trend in rice prices in this city will be slightly abated as a result. The ship will set sail eastward to Kobe, Japan, on Sunday as soon as the unloading is completed.

No Difficulties Expected in Transporting Vietnamese Rice to Shanghai

The English-language "North China Daily Mail" reported that rice prices in this city fell today (November 11), and the selling price of some types of rice was even lower than the officially set price limit. According to rice merchants, the drop in rice prices was due to the 70,000 bags of Vietnamese rice brought from Vietnam by the French ship D'Artagnan today. It is generally believed that Vietnam will not impose any difficulties in transporting rice to Shanghai. Furthermore, according to French Consul-General Maziere, he has requested official details from the Vietnamese side regarding the rumors of Vietnam prohibiting the export of tribute rice, and has not yet received a reply. However, he intends to discuss the matter in detail with the Vietnamese trade mission to Japan passing through Shanghai today, so that he can learn what regulations Vietnam will implement regarding the transport of tribute rice to Shanghai.

French Consul-General Says Rice Reserves Sufficient

Maziere also stated that he has studied the statistics and learned that in recent weeks, a large amount of food rice has been transported to Shanghai from the south. He hopes that the rumors that Vietnam will issue an order prohibiting the export of rice are not entirely accurate. He feels that Shanghai's current rice reserves are sufficient for the current needs, and there is no fear of a rice shortage for the time being. Furthermore, according to a spokesman for the Public Works Department, public concession police officers continued to investigate rice merchant operations this morning and did not find any evidence of price gouging. Any rice merchants accused of price gouging will be punished if there is factual evidence.

Opinions of the Rice Grain Trade Association on Transactions

On the 9th of this month, the concession authorities invited representatives of the rice industry to discuss methods to stabilize the people's food supply. The principle of public warehouse grain storage has been adopted and a subcommittee will be established to discuss the details and implement them. It was also decided that starting from the 12th of this month, all rice grains traded in the market must first pay a deposit of five yuan per bag, with a deadline of five days for delivery of the goods, paying the full price. The Bean Rice Industry and Coarse Grain Oilcake Industry Associations held a meeting yesterday to discuss this. All committee members present stood up to express their opinions, and the discussion was lively. Then they began to discuss (1) the case of implementing the method of requiring a deposit and a deadline for the delivery of rice grains. It was decided that the above-mentioned deposit amount and payment date would be followed in all cases. As for the delivery date, according to the resolution of the joint meeting of the two associations on May 8 of this year, payment must be made within five days from the date of the transaction, with 80% for goods with a bill of lading and 50% for goods without a bill of lading, and weighing and delivery must be completed within ten days. Once a rice grain transaction is completed, it is valid. If the buyer cannot deliver the goods on time, the seller should enforce it and sell it as usual on the eleventh day. If there is a profit, it will be settled and returned to the buyer, and if there is a loss, the deposit will be used to offset it. There will be no further settlement, and it will be enforced by the Market Management Committee.

Negotiate for Vietnamese Rice to be Transported to Shanghai for Sale

(2) Regarding the case of industry peers ordering goods that are reported by foreign firms to be prohibited from export, it was decided that from now on, all goods ordered by industry peers through various foreign firms, regardless of the type, should bring the original invoice and the completed order form to the two associations for registration, by the end of this Saturday, in order to prepare a letter to the foreign firms to raise the matter. (3) Regarding the case of continuing to raise donations for price stabilization and winter relief, it was decided to set a donation target of 50,000 yuan. The fundraising methods will be discussed and decided at the next meeting. The meeting adjourned at about 6:00 p.m., and the announcements will be posted today in the Rice Industry Association Market and the Coarse Grain Oilcake Exchange, and submitted to the authorities for approval.

### Shanghai American Red Cross Telegraphs Home Country to Donate Medical Supplies for Distribution to Orphanages and Charities

The American Red Cross in this city will telegraph the United States, requesting the transport of a large batch of medical supplies to China, including cod liver oil. The orphanages and other charitable organizations here previously obtained cod liver oil from Norway, but since Norway was invaded by Germany, cod liver oil has been impossible to obtain in Shanghai.

### Xinda Xiang Appeals to Tenants, Still Wants to Increase Rent by 80%; High Court Second Branch Observed Both Parties Reaching a Settlement Yesterday

The Xinda Xiang silk and cloth shop at 614 Nanjing Road leases the property from Dehe Foreign Firm for a monthly rent of 1,900 yuan, with monthly expenses, including property taxes, totaling over 2,200 yuan. The shop was originally the site of the former Dahu Bank. There were several offices on the second and third floors for subletting. The place was originally named Dahu Building, later renamed Xinda Xiang Building. In addition to using the entire storefront, the shop occupies nine-tenths of the second floor and two-tenths of the third floor, with the remaining parts sublet to twenty tenants, collecting monthly rent of over 700 yuan. The shop signed leases with the tenants, acting as the landlord, and the leases were all indefinite. However, the shop's lease with Dehe Foreign Firm was a fixed-term lease, expiring on May 16 of this year. Dehe Foreign Firm, due to the shop's particularly prosperous business, notified the shop that starting from May of this year, the rent would be increased by 80%, otherwise the shop must move out. The shop accepted Dehe Foreign Firm's request and at the same time notified all subtenants that the rent would also be increased by 80%. The tenants unanimously opposed this. Subsequently, the shop hired lawyer Wang Zhengshao to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special Court, requesting that the tenants Jinling Typing School, Mu Qing, Meiduo Radio Company, Wang Runtao, Jinjihao Zhou Yinong, etc., pay an 80% rent increase starting from July of this year. Wang Runtao and others immediately hired lawyer Wei Weiqing to defend, stating that the plaintiff, Xinda Xiang silk and cloth shop, is next door to Taichang Ginseng Shop. Dehe Foreign Firm only increased Taichang Ginseng Shop's rent by 10%, while Xinda Xiang's rent was increased by 80%, and Xinda Xiang never voiced any opposition. However, Taichang Ginseng Shop's store area is 750 square feet, with a monthly rent of 627 yuan, which is 8 jiao 3 fen 6 li per square foot. Xinda Xiang's area is 5,250 square feet, so if compared to Taichang Ginseng Shop, the shop's entire storefront would have to pay 4,389 yuan per month, which is more than enough to cover Xinda Xiang's current monthly expenses of only 4,250 yuan. Moreover, nine-tenths of the second floor and two-tenths of the third floor are also used by Xinda Xiang itself. The tenants pay more than 700 yuan in rent per month, which is pure profit for Xinda Xiang. The shop is still not satisfied, and it is unknown what the motive is, and they are trying to increase the rent by 80%, and it is even more unknown what the motive is. After Judge Ni reviewed the case, he ruled that the subtenants' rent should be increased by 10% (following the example of Dehe Foreign Firm increasing Taichang Ginseng Shop's rent). Xinda Xiang silk and cloth shop was dissatisfied with the judgment and hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to appeal, hoping to achieve the goal of an 80% rent increase. The tenants Wang Runtao and others entrusted lawyer Wei Weiqing to act as their agent in the defense, requesting that the original judgment be upheld. After Judge Han of the High Court Second Branch heard the case yesterday, he instructed that the date be changed and advised both parties to go outside and reach a settlement.

### Great China Factory Labor Dispute, Intensified Mediation

Police Department Convened Negotiations Yesterday; Yu Qiaqing Agreed to Serve as Mediator

The labor dispute at the Great China Rubber Factory on Xujiahui Road, which began on the 3rd, has not yet been resolved. The management seems to have completely handed over the responsibility of protecting the factory to the labor side. Therefore, the workers now bear a heavier burden than production work, making their duties more difficult. According to a reporter from the Shewen News Agency, the French Concession authorities, because the labor dispute has been prolonged, causing harm to both labor and management, summoned negotiations again yesterday morning by the head of the Political Affairs Department of the French Police Department, Malai. The labor side requested a 10% wage increase, and the management agreed to half a percent, and negotiations must be held after work is resumed first, resulting in no resolution. It is heard that Mr. Yu Qiaqing has agreed to serve as a mediator in the labor dispute at the factory, and has scheduled a meeting with representatives from both sides this afternoon. It will not be difficult to resolve the labor dispute at the factory.

### Shaoxing Compatriots Planning to Build Zhejiang Shaoxing Hospital

Decided to Provide Free Service to Poor and Sick Compatriots

Pei Yunqing, Huang Yuzhai, Yuan Ludeng, and other wealthy merchants from Shaoxing residing in Shanghai, aware that countless poor and sick compatriots from Shaoxing residing in Shanghai are forced by life to be unable to afford medical treatment, proposed to the Shaoxing Seven Counties Association of Shanghai to build the "Zhejiang Shaoxing Hospital." This charitable undertaking is underway, with a designated fund of 300,000 yuan. The details are recorded below.

Fundraising Conference

The association specially convened a second fundraising conference the other day, attended by dozens of people, including Pei Yunqing, Huang Yuzhai, Wei Jinsan, and Huang Miaoda. Chairman Pei Yunqing reported the purpose of the meeting, and it was decided that Propaganda Director Huang Yuzhai would stand up and report on the propaganda direction. Then, discussion began on (1) the fundraising methods and incentive principles. It was decided that the incentive methods would be approved in principle, with rewards divided into seven levels: 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 yuan. (2) Adding Standing Committee members. It was decided to add Wang Miaoda, Zhu Yaochen, Xie Junshou, Pan Zhigao, Zhou Jiasheng, and Yan Chengde. (3) To facilitate widespread donation collection, in addition to the original eight designated institutions, all banks, money shops, or silver shops managed by compatriots are requested to collect donations. The resolution was passed.

### Two Kidnappings Occurred in the Two Concessions Yesterday Morning, One on Qiqi Road and One on Haifang Road, Kidnappers Used Automobiles, Already Found

Two kidnapping cases occurred successively yesterday morning in the French Concession and the Public Concession. One was the son of the deputy director of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Committee, Jin Youqin, and the other was the small factory owner of the Xin Ya Iron Factory, Cai Guoliang. The details obtained are recorded below.

Schoolboy Kidnapped at Entrance to Lane

At around 8:00 yesterday morning, at the entrance of Lane 195, Qiqi Road, French Concession, four kidnappers suddenly kidnapped an eight-year-old schoolboy who had just come out of the lane, took his bicycle, and put him in a white-plated automobile with the license plate number 12129, which was parked at the entrance of the lane, and sped away. At that time, there were few pedestrians in the area, and it was in a remote location, so only one rickshaw puller witnessed it. Then, a servant from No. 6 in the lane came out and saw a bicycle left at the entrance of the lane, which belonged to his young master. He hurried back to inform his master, Quan Shaowu, who reported it to the French Concession Police Station, which sent investigators to investigate. It was learned that there were a total of four kidnappers, two of whom were carrying handguns. The car they were riding in was a dispatch car from the Albert Road branch of the Taire Company on Myers Road. One kidnapper had rented the car beforehand, but after driving it to a remote location in western Shanghai, he drove the driver, Gao Gengsheng, away and then went to kidnap. The car was found at around 9:00 a.m. within the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Temple Police Station. According to reports, Quan is from Beiping and is the deputy director of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Committee. The French Concession Police Station is now fully investigating the case.

Factory Owner Kidnapped on the Way to the Factory

The owner of the Xin Ya Iron Factory at No. 182, Lane 430, Haifang Road, Public Concession, is Cai Genxing from Wuxian. The factory's accountant is Cai's son, Guoliang (22 years old). Cai and his wife and children live at No. 11, Kangle Lane, Kanglote Road. Usually, he has a reserved charter car for transportation. At 8:30 yesterday morning, Cai's son, Guoliang, took the car to the factory to work. Unexpectedly, when the car passed the intersection of Jinghua Road, three kidnappers suddenly appeared, took out guns, and kidnapped Cai into a car on the side of the road, and sped away at full speed. The chauffeur, A, watched the kidnapper's car leave and hurried home to report the incident. After Cai reported it to the police, because the chauffeur was terrified when threatened by the kidnappers, he did not see the license plate number of the kidnapper's car clearly. It was also heard that before Cai was kidnapped, his father had repeatedly received threatening letters from gangsters.

### Sketches of the British Women's Association Christmas Charity Bazaar (Part 1)

"Mammy, don't get lost!" A foreign girl's delicate voice broke through the subtle, mixed laughter and reached her mother's ears.

Everyone was so crowded they could barely breathe. After finally managing to reach out and buy a ticket for one yuan, they leaned against the handrail of the escalator, which was adorned with green pines and cypresses. Without much effort, they were carried up the stairs, step by step, by the people behind them. Looking down, several pots of three- or four-foot-tall "ivory red" plants were placed at the entrance, looking particularly vibrant and lush under the warm "atmosphere." The ticket booth was piled high with banknotes, accumulating more and more... When they looked up, they were already at the entrance to the "Green Room" on the second floor of the Racecourse, inside which was the charity bazaar organized by the British Women's Association of this city yesterday to raise funds to support their home country's war efforts.

Lady Kerr, the wife of the British Ambassador, had just finished her speech, and everyone applauded, expressing their warm welcome. She stood on the stage with a gentle, spring-like smile. Slender and gracefully dressed in a dark-colored outfit, she looked even more dignified and elegant. A fashionable, brimmed hat accentuated her full but not plump, oval-shaped face, making her look particularly lively and charming. The strong electric light from the magnesium flashbulbs focused on her from all directions, one after another, until she stepped down from the stage. At this time, it was just after three o'clock, and the charity bazaar officially opened.

"Try your luck!"... "Anything else?"... "How lovely it is!" These were the sounds that filled the ears. If I continued to write, I could compile a chapter of English conversation! The room was filled with various foods, daily necessities, and decorative items for the charity bazaar... Crowded with many foreign wives and children. The main hall, located on the grandstand of the Racecourse, was so packed that not even water could seep through. It took a great deal of effort to be able to roll through this "sea of people" in a circle, feeling as if you were being swept along involuntarily.

As soon as you entered, from left to right, along the corner of the wall was a candy stall, followed by a "used goods stall," a book stall, and a counter selling Christmas gifts. Directly opposite the entrance was the "lucky dip," divided into sections for boys and girls. In the center of the hall was a large Christmas tree, adorned with tassels, pendants, ribbons, and silver tinsel, making it very beautiful, with many toys placed around it. Beyond the Christmas tree was an area selling small items made of shells, priced from two dimes to several yuan, which was quite cheap. Near the exit door was a display area for auction items, with many items donated by various businesses in Shanghai, such as Victor records, Lao Jie Fu silks and satins, as well as private donations of fountain pens, tea sets, Chinese paintings, cigars, and whiskey, in a wide variety of styles.

Along the row of stalls along the grandstand windows on the east side were gardening items, women's cosmetics, Tombola (a type of lottery shopping), guessing contests, and a toy counter. The corner selling gardening and homemade goods was decorated with scenery to resemble a house, cut in half, showing great ingenuity. When the opening ceremony was held, Lady Kerr, the wife of the Ambassador, stood in front of this house scenery to deliver her speech. In the lucky draw, thin strips of colored paper were rolled up, each costing one yuan to buy. If you unwrapped it and found a number, you could claim a prize corresponding to that number. The ladies were very enthusiastic in their purchases. The guessing contests cost five dimes or one yuan. You had to guess the number or weight of a basket of shelled nuts or a smoked ham. One old lady wearing glasses, who looked very clever, ran over and lifted the ham with both hands, saying, "Twelve pounds." So, the female employee wrote down her name and address, so that she could be notified at dawn if the ham was indeed twelve pounds. The guessing contests for valuable items had ticket prices as high as five yuan.

Because there were too many people inside, it was not only inconvenient to buy things but also difficult to even look at them. A wife carrying a girl said to her companion, "I brought a check for one hundred yuan and would like to buy a lot of things, but it's too crowded to even get close." Her words expressed a sense of regret. Her companion also complained about the disorganized management of the venue. Mr. Crazors, an accountant, had set up a temporary bank on the second floor, where anyone with checks or needing to make exchanges could go to handle their business.

Finally squeezing out of the north-facing door, walking past the ice cream stand, they turned into the game room, which had games such as fishing, mini golf, using chopsticks to pick up glass balls, travel contests, map pinning, and beanbag toss.

### Fierce Battle to Capture Thieves: Two Bandits Captured Alive

Confiscated Box Cannon and Bullets; Passerby Injured by Stray Bullet

At 7:30 PM last night, detectives Wu Qiming and two others, numbers 383 and 404, from the French Concession police, were walking along the intersection of Route de Macao and Rue Wagner when they noticed four individuals ahead acting suspiciously. They immediately ordered them to stop, intending to search them. Unexpectedly, the four individuals fled eastward, drawing handguns and opening fire to resist arrest. The detectives also drew their guns and returned fire. Both sides exchanged fire for over ten shots, bullets flying everywhere, and pedestrians fled in panic. At that time, two men and two women were injured by stray bullets. The detectives chased the bandits to the intersection of Rue Mityenne and Rue Wagner, arresting Wang Aqiang (32 years old, from Anhui) and Wang Jinbiao (22 years old, from Nanjing). A box cannon and six bullets were found on Wang Jinbiao. The other two bandits escaped without a trace. The two captured bandits, along with the box cannon and bullets, were taken to the police station for interrogation. Simultaneously, an ambulance was called to take the injured pedestrians, Zhang Dejian (20 years old, local, resident of Lane 109, No. 9 Rue Lafayette) with a left foot injury, Wang Arong (18 years old) with a right eye injury, Shen Chen (18 years old, from Zhenjiang, resident of Lane Yinyu, No. 26 Rue Groc) with a left arm injury, and Mao Amei (26 years old, from Guangdong, resident of Pudong) with a left shoulder injury, all four to Guangci Hospital. Fortunately, their injuries were not serious. After being bandaged by the doctors, they were discharged from the hospital. Additionally, Detective No. 383's left shoe was hit by a bullet but his skin was not injured.

### Hooligans Cause Trouble: Vandalize Public Bus

Ticket Seller Hides, Driver Injured

At 9:15 PM last night, a Route 7 public bus was driving along Route Haig near Yidingpan Road when it was stopping. Suddenly, several hooligans began throwing stones into the bus, leading to a conflict with the ticket seller. The hooligans completely shattered the bus's glass windows. Seeing that they were outnumbered, the ticket seller fled into the crowd to take cover. Unexpectedly, the hooligans turned their anger towards the driver, Yi Mingyi (37 years old, from Anhui, resident of No. 5, Lane Shengde, Route Brenan), of bus number 374, dragging him out and striking his head several times with iron bars. Yi was injured, fell to the ground, and lost consciousness. The hooligans then dispersed in a chaotic rush. The police sent him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment.

### Suicide Notices

Yesterday morning at 3:30 AM, Madam Di Wang, a 31-year-old woman residing at No. 499 Route Robert, West Shanghai, suddenly ingested opium and attempted suicide due to recent disputes with her family. She was discovered and sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment.

Yesterday morning at 8:50 AM, a male traveler at the Nanfang Hotel on Jiujiang Road attempted suicide by taking poison in his room. He was discovered by the tea server and rushed to the hospital.

Yesterday afternoon at 1:25 PM, Madam Xu Wang (33 years old) of No. 108 Jing'an Temple Road ingested tranquilizer pills in an attempt to commit suicide. She was sent to Baolong Hospital for emergency treatment.

### Pedestrian in Tushanwan Hit by Stray Bullet

Ji Yanxiang, a 63-year-old local resident, living above Shen Shunyu Hardware Store, Yangjiaqiao, Route Haig, West Shanghai, was returning home from Longhua Town yesterday afternoon at approximately 4:00 PM.

According to Ji, he only heard a gunshot but did not see who fired it.

### Widow's Visit

— Mu He

"I became a widow overnight. It's really something I never expected..." she said, seemingly lost.

Looking at her lost face and the child she held in her arms, wearing a white cloth hat with a white ball on top, I also felt a little lost. I couldn't say a word of comfort, and didn't seem to want to say anything. Yes, what's the use of mere sympathy for widows and orphans, except for practical help?

"I really don't know how to thank you, truly... You don't know how sad I am. Since he died, besides you visiting me, only a strange old woman saw me and the child wearing mourning clothes and said a sympathetic word: 'So young, such a small child, and already without a man, widowed, it's really pitiful.'" she said, her eyes shining with gratitude towards me.

I was surprised, I was amazed: Such a small act of sympathy could evoke such sincere emotion from her?

"You're surprised, aren't you?" she seemed to understand what I meant. "It's simple, what's so strange? I've become a widow, and everyone looks down on me, even dislikes me; and even the child is no exception. That day I personally heard the landlady say to someone: 'It's this child's bad luck, with an unlucky horoscope. Ever since that child was born, either the husband was sick or she was bedridden, medicine pots never left the door.'" She looked at the child sleeping quietly in her arms.

The child is innocent, I thought.

"On the day of the coffin, I was really sad, but I couldn't cry. They insisted that I cry; and the child? They said this was his last time seeing his father, that he had to cry a farewell, so they hit the child, hit his face, twisted his arms, and the child cried loudly. I was really sad when I saw it then, and now I regret why I didn't stop them then..." She looked at the child again, holding him tightly.

The child is innocent, I thought.

"Because I didn't cry 'properly,' because my crying wasn't loud enough and I didn't wail while crying, they all said I was too impolite, resented me, hated me, and looked down on me." she continued, "When I went back carrying the child, the landlady held a burning grass stalk from afar to greet me, telling me to carry the child and step over the fire, saying it was to 'burn' away the 'bad luck,' ah, I really couldn't take it, ah..." she cried.

The child is innocent, and she is innocent, I thought again.

"I can't think about how to live in the future – I dare not think. The hostility of others right now is already scaring me to death..." she sobbed.

On the way back, I seemed to see many hostile faces waving before my eyes. I understood that humanity is unwilling to easily give even cheap sympathy, and only 'bestows' it after carefully assessing the recipient. I clenched my fist angrily, letting the cold wind blow on my face, and I gazed at this ruthless society.

Family

### Wife's Appeal

Dear Editor:

This is an appeal from a pitiful wife. Please show me a path!

We are partners united by love. For three years, our small family life has been quite happy. We each have stable jobs and a considerable income, enough to support a family of above-average means. We have no vices, no worries, both parents are alive, and our siblings are well. Except for lacking a child, I can't think of anything else we need.

I don't know how it happened, but misfortune suddenly descended upon our heads: This spring, stock prices soared. Several of my husband's colleagues, who were keen on wealth and status, were frantically making phone calls outside every day. All he heard was how Old Wang had made a thousand in profits and how Ah Zhang had made eight hundred from the Yangtze. Over time, he also became eager and scraped together some capital to join the speculative business. At first, things went smoothly, and he earned a thousand or two, so he was reluctant to stop. Finally, one day, stock prices plummeted, like a mountain torrent bursting its banks! His capital and profits were all poured into this terrible pit!

In this desperate situation, he still couldn't accept it and kept dreaming of recouping his losses every day. He even took leave from the office to go to some silver house to watch the market. But what's the use? It's like a soldier stuck in the mud, sinking deeper and deeper.

Look at our life now! The house is mortgaged, the furniture is sold, the savings are pawned, and even my precious jewelry and personal savings have been completely emptied. We still owe tens of thousands in debt!

I have repeatedly advised him to quit and said that by enduring a few years of hardship, we can repay the debt. But surrounded and tempted by a group of bad friends, he is already dazed. How can my words have any effect! A few days ago, I saw him writing in the air again, without any appetite for food, and realized that he had secretly lost several hundred yuan again!

Sir: He has stumbled. What should I do? If this continues, our future will be unimaginable! Empty words cannot strengthen his will, and quarreling only increases anger. Please give me a more effective method! A person's downfall not only affects the happiness of his family but is also a great loss to the country and society!

A desperately worried woman respectfully writes.

To the Young and Wise Lady:

It is truly regrettable that a husband's stumble in speculative business has brought so much unrest to a family. In this unfortunate situation, it is a good opportunity for a virtuous wife to show her abilities. You are right, quarreling is harmful and useless, and gentle persuasion should continue whenever good opportunities arise. In addition to these two points, you should express sympathy for your husband's misfortune, but you should still insist on opposing his actions. Although the family's situation is not as good as before, you should maintain an optimistic and calm attitude and manage the household affairs well so that your husband does not feel disgusted with the family.

Your husband is currently influenced by his colleagues, so he sees your words as blowing in the wind. But you must not be discouraged because of this. His confused brain will one day clear up. We feel that there is one thing you can try in this regard. In addition to constantly advising your husband, you can also try to approach his colleagues and persuade them to jump out of the deep pit of speculation. If possible, it is best to unite the wives of these colleagues and act together so that they can realize the truth as soon as possible.

Your views on speculative business are correct. We believe that you are a rare, ambitious, and virtuous wife. We believe that with your perseverance and hard work, your family can return to the right path. We wish you success soon. Editor

### Willow of Zhangtai

— Gu Mingdao

Shi Da pointed his hand out the window with all ten fingers and said: "Jingyuan is just ahead. Since you're going to tour the garden, please feel free. I'm immensely grateful for the fine wine and delicacies you've bestowed upon me, so allow me to drink a few more cups. If you want to drink with a beggar, I'm ashamed and undeserving, and also very uneasy." Zhang Tianru, hearing Shi Da speak so frankly, then said: "Very well. We have at least a dozen catties of wine on board, and we all have a low tolerance. Please, strong man Shi, drink as much as you like." Shi Da said: "Thank you for your hospitality. If you want to tour Jingyuan, please go ahead." Jiang Zi was initially afraid of the big man, but now was delighted by his forthrightness mixed with charm, only smiling foolishly at him. So Zhang Tianru left the great man Shi Da in the cabin to drink, while he himself took the Liu sisters ashore to Jingyuan. Jingyuan is a famous garden near the Chuihong Pavilion. Although small, its structure is very winding and magnificent. It is the place where the poet Ni Nanyun lived in seclusion. Zhang Tianru and Ni Nanyun were also literary friends, often exchanging poems and wine, so this time he took the Liu sisters to visit him and tour Jingyuan. The Liu sisters were originally from Songling. They were orphans from a young age, and their circumstances were pitiful. They became adopted daughters of Xu Danniang. Xu Danniang was also a famous courtesan in Shengze Town when she was young. Later, as she got older and her body grew fatter, she could no longer entertain guests herself, so she took the Liu sisters as adopted daughters and treated them as her own. The elder one was named Yang Ai, styled Yinglin, and the younger one was named Jiang Zi. As for the beautiful names of Ru Shi, they were given by Zhang Tianru. Ru Shi and Jiang Zi were a pair of flower sisters. Although they were beautiful and had a thin fate, they were helpless and dependent, they were both born with celestial beauty and a talented heart. Xu Danniang hired famous teachers to teach them reading and writing, and Liu Ru Shi's large and small calligraphy was truly well-written and delicate, and her singing voice was clear and crisp, like a good bird on a branch, so she was famous in Jiangnan. The Guijia Courtyard where they lived was bustling with carriages and horses, and the door was like a market. Xu Danniang had this pair of cash cows, so how could she not be happy? But Ru Shi's temperament was lonely and self-admiring, very proud, always self-possessed, and rarely allowed access. Those who came to visit were all refined people, and everyone knew her temperament, so they dared not treat her lightly. This was also because Ru Shi's talent and appearance were enough to overwhelm the group of beauties, so people naturally willingly gave her a bit of space. And her younger sister Jiang Zi was as intelligent and outstanding as her sister, so those who saw them could not help but praise them. Zhang Tianru, a famous scholar of the Fushe Society, retired to his home and, upon seeing Ru Shi, praised her as a celestial being and came to her boudoir every day to teach them poetry and lyrics. He was delighted that the two of them learned one thing and knew three, heard one thing and knew two, were very intelligent, and made rapid progress. Over the past year or two, Ru Shi's poetry has greatly improved, and her memory is particularly strong, never forgetting what she has seen, so she is also very knowledgeable about the classics. She is also able to deeply understand the meaning of reading and gains insights. Zhang Tianru, in his later years, gained this pair of female disciples, who could be trusted to carry on his legacy, and his heart was content. Seeing Ru Shi, such a beautiful woman, could not help but be moved. The so-called affection is like us. In his heart, he very much wanted to take Liu Ru Shi as a concubine, but he was not someone with a large salary, and could not take out ten bushels of pearls to hire her, and build a golden house to hide A Jiao, so he could only teach books in her boudoir every day. Being with this extremely intelligent female disciple, her beauty could cure hunger. This was also a kind of infatuation for Zhang Tianru. In fact, since Liu Ru Shi prided herself on her talent and beauty, she would never be willing to marry an old scholar in a remote village when choosing someone to serve. In her mind, there was naturally someone else. (7)

### "Mr. Wang" on Stage, "Mr. Wang's Troupe" Renamed "Unnamed Troupe," Performing "Mr. Wang Exposes the Western Mirror"

— Xing Gu

Tang Jie, this Mr. Wang who makes people laugh on the screen, has a history of serving in the film circle that cannot be considered short. At first, he was an actor in the Star Film Company. Later, Ye Qianyu's Mr. Wang comic strip became very popular. With a flash of inspiration, Tang Jie appeared on the screen imitating Mr. Wang. At that time, he was in Tianyi Film Company. Unexpectedly, the "Mr. Wang" film was very popular with the audience. In this way, Tang Jie became "Mr. Wang" for a long time.

After the war broke out, Tang Jie once organized a "Mr. Wang's Troupe" and performed in various parts of the mainland, which was well-received by all parties. Later, it merged with the "Movie Star Troupe." Last year, the "Movie Star Troupe" disbanded, and Tang Jie returned to Shanghai and joined Xinhua Film Company to continue making Mr. Wang films. Now, after the completion of "Mr. Wang's Night Visit to the Funeral Home," Tang Jie has asked the KMT authorities for leave for a period of time to revive his "Mr. Wang's Troupe" and seek further development.

Yesterday, the reporter met Tang Jie. During the conversation, it was learned that the performance of "Mr. Wang's Troupe" has made great progress. Because the mainland cannot be visited at present, it has been decided to perform in Shanghai first. The date is from the 18th to the 24th of this month, a total of one week. The location has been tentatively set at the Xuan Palace Theater.

For some reasons, the performance name will not be "Mr. Wang's Troupe" but will be changed to "Unnamed Troupe." The troupe members are all from the original cast of "Mr. Wang's Troupe." The name of the performance is "Mr. Wang Exposes the Western Mirror." As the name suggests, it is another comedy.

### "Kingdom of Women"

Yi Hua Film Company New Director Chen Huanwen, since his *Three Smiles* was released, has been highly valued by Yi Hua Film Company. Therefore, his second film was given an even greater opportunity. Chen Huanwen himself has selected and adapted a section of *Romance of the Flowers in the Mirror* about the Kingdom of Women, and named it "Kingdom of Women." This script has been reviewed by production director Yan Youxiang and was put into production last Wednesday.

The actors in "Kingdom of Women" have almost mobilized all the new and old actors of Yi Hua Film Company, especially the newcomers, all of whom have participated in the work of "Kingdom of Women." The role of the Queen of Women has been taken by newcomer Miss Di Ping. Miss Di Ping comes from Singapore, but her Mandarin is extremely fluent. Yi Hua Film Company has great hopes for her. She was once appointed as the lead actress in the new film "Qianli Song Jingniang," but later it was changed to star in "Kingdom of Women" due to the needs of the film.

The more important roles include Yan Hua's Zhi Zhiyang, Zheng Zhong's Tang Ao, and Tan Guangyou's Duo Jiugong.

### Portraits of Female Artists

— Tang

(Eleven) Xu Xuelou

In the storytelling world, everyone knows that there is a well-known Xu Sandang. The early Xu Sandang was led by Xu Xuesheng, with Xuesheng's sister Xueren and female disciple Xueyue as assistants, famous for singing "Three Smiles" and "Painting the Golden Phoenix." At this time last year, Xueren married in Suzhou, and Xueyue also left Xu Xuesheng after completing her apprenticeship and started her own show (recently, Xueyue has been performing in Wujin and will be going to Wujiang soon). Therefore, Xu Xuelou and Xu Xuehua were replaced to fill the vacancies left by Xueyue and Xueren. Xuesheng plays the sanxian, Xuelou plays the yueqin, and Xuehua plays the pipa. This has become the current Xu Sandang. Every night, they sing and play at the Nanjing storytelling venue, receiving the welcome of storytelling fans.

What will be introduced here is the rising star of Xu Sandang - Miss Xu Xuelou.

Xuelou's original surname is Tang. Jiaxing, which has scenic spots such as the Misty Rain Tower on Mandarin Duck Lake, is her hometown. Unfortunately, she lost both of her parents at a young age. She was adopted into the Wu family in Lili, so she also took the surname Wu and was named Yuexian. When Wu Yunquan, who was good at telling "Twin Phoenix Pearls," was performing in Lili, she became Wu Yunquan's apprentice in a simple ceremony because of her interest, and learned to sing "Twin Phoenix Pearls." She was intelligent and usually studied diligently, so she made rapid progress. At the age of fifteen, she "debuted" and started her own show. Before the war, she sang and played in Suzhou. Although this little girl had not "debuted" for long, she was born with a face that was suitable for both anger and joy. A smile would reveal two dimples, and her singing was very clear, so she had a bit of the magic of summoning people. During that time, she once paired up with Hua Yusheng, Xu Xuesheng's senior brother. Later, she collaborated with Xu Xuesheng, which was introduced by Hua Yusheng. In name, she is Xu Xuesheng's adopted daughter and female disciple. Her change of name to Xu Xuelou also started from this.

Xuelou has been "debuted" until now for three years. That is to say: she is already eighteen years old this year! She also understands a little bit of writing, and newspapers and magazines are her amateur pastime. What she is good at is acting as the "primary player," speaking, cracking jokes, playing, and singing, completely imitating Xu Xueyue. Therefore, some people who used to worship Xu Xueyue are now fascinated by this successor of Xu Xueyue - Xu Xuelou.

The Xu Sandang used to only sing "Three Smiles" and "Painting the Golden Phoenix." Since Xuelou joined the Xu Sandang, Xuesheng also got a "Twin Phoenix Pearls" script from Xuelou's hand. Therefore, the old listeners of Xu Sandang all say: "Xuelou is Xu Xuesheng's female disciple, and at the same time, she can be said to be Xuesheng's teacher!"
