### Japan Feels Annoyed with Negotiations; Situation in Vietnam Becomes Tense; Tominaga Arrives in Hanoi with New Instructions from Tokyo; Japanese Delegation Prepares to Withdraw and Exert Greater Force; Japan Actually Demands Joint Rule

Chongqing: According to news from Guilin, although the French authorities in Hanoi have allowed most of the Japanese demands, the Japanese delegation is still exerting pressure, forcing the French to comply with all demands. According to news from Hong Kong, unless the French divide Vietnam into zones and jointly rule the province of Tokyo, the Japanese will not be satisfied. A well-informed source in Guilin stated that the French have agreed to the Japanese demands, including: (1) Japan is allowed to land in Haiphong and pass through Vietnam along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway; (2) the number of Japanese troops landed should not exceed 30,000, so as not to exceed two-thirds of the French garrison in Tokyo; (3) the Japanese army can build an air force base in Hanoi. However, the Japanese still insist on landing 120,000 troops, which is the reason for the continuation of the negotiations. These negotiations may reach a final resolution by the end of this week. (United Press, 17th)

Chongqing: The Central Daily News reported that Japan is now demanding joint French-Japanese rule over Vietnam. The Japanese side wants to divide Vietnam into three zones: (1) the north to be ruled by Japan; (2) the central region to become a buffer zone; (3) the south to be ruled by France. The Japanese are also demanding that Hanoi become a Japanese air force base, and coastal ports and estuaries become naval bases. However, there is no confirmation whether the above-mentioned demands are included in the agreement currently under discussion. The Japanese Fifth Column is extremely active in Vietnam. The continuous rain has made all roads impassable. However, the rainy season will end by the end of this month, after which the situation in Vietnam cannot remain unchanged. (Reuters, 17th)

Hanoi: According to sources from the Japanese delegation, the Japanese delegation is quite unhappy with the unwarranted delays in the French-Japanese negotiations. This situation may force Japan to take stronger measures. However, Japanese sources do not confirm or deny that stronger measures or another final ultimatum may be used to deal with Vietnam. The strengthening of the Japanese attitude can be seen in the arrival of General Tominaga, a member of the military group of the Japanese delegation. It is said that Tominaga has come with new instructions from Tokyo, and a well-informed Japanese source said that General Nishihara has instructed all members of the delegation to prepare to withdraw if necessary. The situation is becoming tense again, which can be seen from this. Japanese Consul General Suzuki told a United Press reporter that the withdrawal of Japanese residents can be decided within the next few days. Members of the Japanese delegation told a United Press reporter that they are quite annoyed with the meeting and accused the French of intentionally delaying the process with the detailed discussion procedures they have set. This fact and the arrival of General Tominaga may lead the Japanese to exert pressure. As for the rumors that Thailand is demanding that Vietnam redraw the Thai-Vietnamese border, French officials have not received any official reports. The Japanese consul also stated that he has not received any official reports of this news. However, the Japanese consul said that anything Thailand wants to do is not within the scope of the current French-Japanese negotiations. Local officials cannot confirm the rumor that Thailand has sent troops to the Cambodian border. According to news arriving here, the Chinese army has begun to dismantle 72 kilometers of the Yunnan section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and use it for the Kunming-Xufu line. Although the Japanese side accuses the meeting of not proceeding smoothly and wants to adopt strong measures, this threat has no effect on the Vietnamese people celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival. Annamese soldiers are all on holiday and traveling, and French officers are giving toys to the children of native soldiers. Vietnamese Governor-General Teckuza has returned from spending the week in the mountains and is said to be prepared to negotiate. (United Press, 17th)

### Moscow Broadcasts to China as a Form of Propaganda

Chongqing: Soviet propagandist Chang Zha made his first appearance on a Far Eastern radio broadcast. A Moscow shortwave radio station has begun broadcasting to China in Chinese. The content of the broadcast includes the liberation of the people of Belarusian and Western Ukraine, the politics of the Uzbek Republic, and the living conditions in the Soviet Union. (Associated Press, 17th)

### Guilin Actively Promotes the New Life Movement

Guilin: Guilin is actively promoting the New Life Movement. In addition to publicity and guidance, it has also decided to organize an inspection team jointly by more than ten agencies, including the Municipal Health Department, from the 20th to the 29th of this month to implement inspections. Those with excellent results will be awarded certificates by the New Life Movement Association to show encouragement. (17th)

Vichy: According to an official French telegram arriving here today, the French authorities did not receive any prior notice from the Chinese side regarding the Chinese army's bombing of the international railway bridge between Hekou and Lao Kai on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. The bridge was destroyed by General Chiang Kai-shek's troops to disconnect the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. China did not notify France of the plan to cut off traffic on the road or the decision to take over the section of the road within Yunnan Province. The road is in a valley with overlapping mountains, with no less than 400 tunnels and bridges, most of which have been damaged by Japanese aircraft. French officials believe that China cut off the road to prevent the Japanese from transporting troops to Yunnan via this only rapid route. After the railway is cut off, the Japanese army will not be able to reach it quickly and will have to proceed slowly along this narrow and windy path. The Chinese army can then blockade or besiege the Japanese army passing through the valley. There are very few roads that can pass through the mountains, and the roads are rugged and difficult to travel. (Associated Press, 17th)

Singapore: The Malayan newspapers are all worried about the possibility that China may abandon the United Kingdom and become pro-American in retaliation for the British-Japanese compromise on the blockade of the Burma Road. The Singapore Free Press stated that the Chinese should know that China's interests are tied to the cooperation between the United Kingdom and the United States in the Far East. Rumors that the United Kingdom and the United States are at odds will actually harm China's interests. The English newspapers here all stated that the blockade of the Burma Road is temporary, citing former Prime Minister Chamberlain's words that "the temporary blockade is hoped to give time for China and Japan to find peace." The newspapers also stated that although the United Kingdom is eager for the end of the Sino-Japanese war, it has not persuaded Chongqing to accept conditions that the Chinese people are not satisfied with. The recent Japanese attacks on Chongqing show that the Japanese have not sought a peaceful solution to the war, but are forcing the British government to not reopen the Burma Road in October. The newspapers added that what is needed today is that China, the United Kingdom, and the United States can reach an understanding in the Far East. Any attempt to arouse ill will will not only be unhelpful, but will also have adverse consequences for the status of the three countries. As for the United States not supporting the United Kingdom, it is best to avoid much discussion. The two countries both have the freedom to act independently, and any discrepancies must be due to their different circumstances. In short, British-American understanding must be maintained, and the Burma Road issue must not be allowed to cause harm to it. (Associated Press, 17th)

Bangkok: Thailand has begun negotiations with the Vichy French government to return part of the territory of Vietnam, including the provinces of Paichapag and Luang Prabang in Laos, and eastern Cambodia in the south, all of which were incorporated into Vietnam from Thai territory. Local officials have already confirmed this news. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)

### Sichuan Gentry Voluntarily Donates Military Grain

Chengdu: Since Chiang Kai-shek, as Chairman of the Provisional National Assembly, issued a public letter on grain management, the virtuous gentry in various places, moved by the sincerity of Chairman Chiang, have voluntarily donated military grain. In addition to the two gentrymen, Chi and Han, in Qijiang, each donating 500 stones of grain a few days ago, there have been several other cases. The provincial government has transferred the request for commendation to the central government. Also, the provincial government recently received a telegram from Li Boying, the magistrate of Qijiang County, stating that another 1,000 stones of grain have been raised in Guofu Township in the county, and other local gentrymen will also enthusiastically donate. (17th)

### Tibetan Representatives Swear Allegiance in Lanzhou

Lanzhou: All the representatives of the pardoned people in the southwestern border area of Gansu Province held a public oath of allegiance ceremony in Lanzhou on the morning of the 15th. First, all the representatives read the oath of allegiance to the Party and the country and the supreme leader, and then presented to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek a banner of "The Light of the Nation," to Zhu Shaoliang a banner of "The Great Wall of the Northwest," and to all the officers and soldiers of the certain war zone a banner of "Pillars of the Party and the Country." Zhu accepted the banners on behalf of the recipients. The conference also sent a telegram to the Chairman to pay respects. (16th)

### Most of the Zhengtai Railway Tracks Have Been Dismantled; Japanese Reinforcements in Jincheng Were Defeated by the Chinese Army; Traffic on the Tongpu and Pinghan Railways Was Also Obstructed

Chongqing: The Xinhua Daily recently stated that traffic on the 70-mile-long Zhengtai Railway has been completely suspended because one-third of the tracks and most of the bridges have been destroyed by the Chinese army. It will take at least half a year for the Japanese to repair the entire line. In addition, traffic on the Tongpu and Pinghan Railways is also often obstructed. (Associated Press, 17th)

Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesperson stated that more than 1,000 Japanese troops rushing to reinforce a certain town in southeastern Jin have now been repelled by the Chinese army. The Chinese army repelled the Japanese army in the vicinity of Jincheng. In this battle, seven tanks and forty trucks were also captured. The battle took place on September 13. (Associated Press, 10th)

Luoyang: After the Japanese army in eastern Jin suffered a defeat, they recently mobilized more than 10,000 reinforcements and launched a fierce attack on Yangquan, Pingding, Xiyang (all south of the Zhengtai Railway), and Yu County (north of the Zhengtai Railway) and other counties in the Zhengtai Railway area. The Chinese army divided its forces on both sides of the Zhengtai Railway to meet the attack, and the fighting is even more fierce. At the moment, the Chinese army is completing an encirclement of the Japanese army and continuing to destroy traffic on the Zhengtai Railway. (16th)

### Chinese Army in Eastern Hubei Fiercely Attacks Tuanfeng

Fancheng: The Chinese army in eastern Hubei has been attacking the Japanese army for days and has been very successful. On the 8th, they captured Lao Ba River in one fell swoop, and then captured Fang Gaoping. The Chinese army continued to attack Tuanfeng fiercely and has destroyed all the Japanese strongholds, fortifications, and transportation facilities near Tuanfeng. (16th)

### Jiangxi People Perform Plays to Raise Funds to Donate Airplanes

The Ji'an Ganzhou Public Leisure Association, in response to the call of the theater community to donate airplanes, held a Chinese Opera Day, with all the proceeds being remitted to the Aviation Headquarters. Commissioner Chiang Ching-kuo generously donated 100 yuan to take the lead, and also donated another 50 yuan for local wounded soldiers' mooncakes. (17th)

Editorial

### The International Situation of the Past Nine Years

Everything that has happened in these nine years should be a epoch-making chapter in the history of China, the history of Japan, and the history of the world!

Now, the whole world is in turmoil, and more than half of humanity is in a state of panic. With all their energy and strength, they are still frantically dealing with the endless changes and developments. Who has the time to calmly review the past? But in our silence, in our unconsciousness, and unintentionally, the international situation of nine years ago comes to mind, as if it were right before our eyes.

If we understand clearly that the incident in the past had a global nature from the beginning, then the most heartbroken people would probably be the Chinese, who were the first to bear the brunt. The Chinese people encountered the calamity that began at that time and inevitably had to pay a terrible and enormous price to overcome it. However, how many nations in the world are now paying an even more terrible and enormous price to consume the even more severe calamities they have encountered. If they had understood the global nature of the incident in the past, and if they had prepared even one-thousandth of the price they are now paying and stood up, then the calamities they are now encountering and the prices they are paying would not have been as unavoidable as China's. Unfortunately, they were too clever at the time to watch the fire from the other side of the river, and as a result, they are now facing an even more terrible destruction. This is not a ruthless and pointless accusation. The past is gone, and the future is long. This is a painful and poignant lesson!

Looking back at that time: China had not yet completed unification and had no power to speak of externally. It also adhered very morally to international justice and expected international justice to be initiated. Compared with now, on the one hand, we have the self-awareness and determination to rely on our own efforts, and on the other hand, we also have the courage to support international justice ourselves. Thinking of the past from today, these nine years have passed in a flash, and whether in spirit or in reality, there is a feeling of being in another world. As for the international atmosphere at that time, it was believed that the strong were invincible and the weak were beyond salvation. It was believed that as long as the weak and small countries were sacrificed a little, the ambitions of the aggressors could be satisfied and they would stop at that. Today, these kinds of ideas have been proven by facts to be illusions. Not to mention the belligerent countries in the great cauldron, even isolationists in countries as well-off as the United States are gradually changing their minds. The waves of the incident have made the United States feel: (1) The breaking of the dignity of treaties, thus knowing that treaties alone are not enough to maintain the status quo of the world. Nine years ago, the United States was fully engaged in the recovery work after the economic panic, but now it has to devote most of its attention to expanding its vast military preparations. (2) The situation in the Pacific, since the signing of the "Washington Treaty" in 1921, has been damaged, and it has been discovered that there is a great threat on the other side of the Pacific. At that time, the United States did make some statements based on the "Kellogg-Briand Pact" and the "Nine-Power Treaty." At the beginning of the incident, the United States adopted a firm attitude, and the then Secretary of State of the United States, Stimson, intended to launch something, but unfortunately, he could not achieve anything due to being alone.

Compared with the United States, the Soviet Union was also actually feeling threatened at that time. Because the rise of militarism in the Far East made the Soviet Union feel that the encirclement of the great powers it had suffered in 1917 might reappear. Therefore, although the Soviet Union did not take any special actions at that time, its Foreign Minister, Litvinov, also made repeated statements, and from then on, the Red Army gradually moved towards the frozen eastern border.

Whether the British Empire will have to withdraw from the Far East in the future is a question. If it does withdraw, then the seeds were sown in the past. Originally, the United Kingdom had a very strong voice in all matters concerning the Far East, but only at that time, the United Kingdom was surprisingly silent. The British authorities at that time seemed to have another illusion, and simply rejected the United States' invitation to take joint action, and repeatedly made various defenses in the League of Nations. The British Foreign Secretary at that time was Sir John Simon, whom the Chinese people still remember to this day.

The current France is too tragic. It was not like this nine years ago! At that time, French Foreign Minister Briand was influential and active in the League of Nations, and he was able to manipulate things as he pleased. He was the virtual leader of the League of Nations, but not a faithful believer in the terms of the Covenant. But look at how he disregarded the spirit of the Covenant and tortuously excused Japan at the League of Nations! It was at that time that the long-shelved "French-Japanese Treaty on Vietnam" was suddenly signed. Thinking of this, seeing today's France and today's Vietnam makes people trace back to the past and sigh!

Looking at everything that has passed in the past nine years, the United States and the Soviet Union have been worthy of praise from the beginning, and now it is clear that this is the case. The United Kingdom and France initially made wrong moves due to insufficient understanding, but in recent years, it is clear that they have also discovered the mistakes of the past. As for how to correct and remedy them, half depends on their sense of morality and half depends on their actual strength. Today, who still resents the United Kingdom and France without sympathizing with them? It is hoped that their correction and remedy of mistakes will not become a permanent wish due to lack of strength!

### U.S. Secretary of State Meets with British Ambassador to Discuss Far East Naval Issues; Will Jointly Defend with Australia to Deal with Japanese Threat; Naval Chief Inspects Pacific Bases

Washington: Today, U.S. Secretary of State Hull, British Ambassador to the United States Lothian, and Australian Minister Casey met for an hour to discuss Far East naval issues arising from Japan's southward policy and Germany's threat to the British fleet. The results were not disclosed by the three, but it is expected that Australia is concerned about the extent to which it can rely on the protection of the U.S. Pacific Fleet if the entire British fleet is transferred to the Mediterranean and North Sea. Naval personnel here stated that the majority of the U.S. fleet is now based in the Pacific, and because British Prime Minister Churchill has guaranteed that the British fleet will not escape or surrender, it will remain stationed there. (International News Service, 17th)

Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Hull, British Ambassador Lothian, and Australian Minister Casey met for a long time yesterday. After the meeting, Lothian told people that most of the discussions were related to Australia. It is believed that they discussed Japan's actions in Vietnam and the impact of Japanese actions on Australia. It is generally predicted that the U.S. and Australia may conclude a joint defense agreement similar to the one established by the U.S. and Canada. (Reuters, 17th)

San Diego: Naval Chief Admiral Knox arrived here yesterday from Hawaii aboard a navy bomber of the Four Masted type. Knox is now touring Pacific naval bases and visited Pearl Harbor this week. (Associated Press, 17th)

San Diego: Naval Chief Admiral Knox stated that a U.S. naval squadron left Honolulu for the Pacific coast yesterday. Two other squadrons, each with thirty warships, will also follow. Each squadron will stay in U.S. territorial waters for half a month to allow shore leave and repairs. (Reuters, 17th)

Tokyo: The Hochi Shimbun stated in an editorial today that the Pacific is now undergoing an ominous transformation due to the European war. The U.S.-Canada joint defense agreement, the relocation of the main force of the U.S. fleet to the Pacific, and the U.S.-U.K.-Australia trilateral negotiations currently underway have changed the situation in the Pacific. The recent statements by British Foreign Secretary Halifax and U.S. Secretary of State Hull expressing deep concern about maintaining the status quo in French Vietnam are all signs of active intervention by the U.K. and the U.S. in the Vietnam issue. The newspaper then warned the U.K. and the U.S. that if they intervene in Far East affairs, Japan's southward policy will develop even more actively. The newspaper urged Japan to urgently proceed with building a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, with the South Sea region being necessary for national survival, and to include it within the sphere regardless of any obstacles made by the U.K. and the U.S. in Japan's path. (Reuters, 17th)

St. John's, Newfoundland: A group of U.S. experts has arrived here to survey locations that can be used as naval and air force bases. The base in Newfoundland is included in the recently concluded U.S.-U.K. treaty. (Reuters, 17th)

### Roosevelt Signs Conscription Bill

Washington: President Roosevelt signed the "Burke-Wadsworth Selective Service Act" yesterday and set October 16 as the date for men aged 21 to 35 to register. (Associated Press, 17th)

Washington: After signing the conscription bill, President Roosevelt issued a notice urging the United States to fulfill its mission and arm itself to defend against aggression from any direction. The President stated, "The United States is now at a turning point in its destiny. Time and distance have been reduced. Within a few weeks, we have witnessed the destruction of several powerful nations. We cannot ignore the belief in the force that is rampant in the world. We know the terrible fate of weak nations that are being insulted. We should exert our great strength to defend against war from the coast. We should prevent our land from being sacrificed to aggression. We have the determination." (International News Service, 17th)

Washington: The U.S. conscription bill was signed by President Roosevelt at the White House yesterday afternoon. When the signing ceremony was held, the chairmen of the military committees of both houses of Congress, Secretary of War Stimson, and General Marshall were present. After signing the bill, the President made a statement, saying, "The United States has adopted all selective service measures in peacetime, expanding the basic concept of citizenship. In addition to equal rights and equal opportunities, we also have equal service. In preparing for national defense, we have not opened a new path unprecedented in the history of democratic systems, but reiterated the old principles of civil administration." After the national registration is completed, approximately 75,000 conscripts will be enlisted in the first batch within about a month, and 100,000 or 125,000 people will be conscripted one after another so that there can be 400,000 conscripts by January of next year and 900,000 in the spring. This new conscription law also stipulates that the government has the right to take over factories by means of leasing when necessary. (Reuters, 17th)

### National Guard Troops Report for Duty

Washington: Since yesterday, according to the National Defense Force Mobilization Act, 60,500 National Guard troops from 26 states have been reporting to registration offices to train with the regular army for a year. These soldiers must first undergo a physical examination by a doctor and finally swear allegiance to the United States government. According to the conscription bill signed by President Roosevelt yesterday, it is expected that 16,500,000 people will be registered quickly, of which 500,000 will be registered quickly and 5 million will be classified as "Class A." "Class A" means that they must be in excellent physical condition, not need to support relatives, and not be employed in important factories. These will be the first batch of trainees under the conscription bill, the purpose of which is to train 5 million citizens for national defense. Another 400,000 people may be registered again in April of next year, 550,000 people in October, 650,000 people in November, and 400,000 people in December. Article 15 of the conscription bill explains that "the term 'United States,' geographically speaking, shall include the states, such as Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico." The Department of the Army stated that the Panama Canal is not included in the United States because it is located in foreign territory and not in the continental United States. The Philippines is not included because the Filipinos are not citizens of the United States and are enjoying a special status and moving towards self-government. Because Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico belong to the continental United States, they will be affected by the Manpower Act in the same way as the State of Columbia. However, according to the Manpower Act, trained soldiers may be sent to any area within the Western Hemisphere or U.S. territory, including the Philippines. (Associated Press, 17th)

### General Marshall's Broadcast Address: America Has Encountered a Crisis; A Strong Army Must Be Established

Washington - U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, in a broadcast today, warned radio listeners that the coming six months might be the most dangerous period in American history. He said, "America is currently facing a first-class modern military crisis, and we must find a way to deal with it." He believes the conscription bill is a fundamental plan for self-defense and protection of "our political system of government." He also stated that 1940 is completely different from 1917. In 1917, the United States was not in danger of being invaded, but now it is different. He said he plans to build at least a 1,200,000-strong, well-trained army based on a foundation of 225,000 troops. What is actually needed to defend the Western Hemisphere is a 2,000,000-strong, well-trained, and fully equipped army. Even then, 1,200,000 would be insufficient. Observers believe that the War Department has instructed Marshall to tell the national audience that on October 15, another 35,700 National Guard troops will be called up to join the 60,000 National Guard troops who have already reported today. These National Guard troops come from New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, Mississippi, Puerto Rico, and Ohio. Officials pointed out that this gradually mobilized National Guard will be used to form four infantry divisions, one cavalry division, and one mechanized division. (International News Service dispatch on the 17th)

### The U.S. to Construct an Air Force with Huge Sums; 45,000-Ton Battleship Construction Begins

Washington - The War Department today signed contracts with five companies to order aircraft worth $160,284,000 to strengthen the air force. It is said that this money will be used exclusively for manufacturing fighter planes and training planes. (United Press dispatch on the 17th)

New York - The U.S. Navy Department yesterday began construction of a 45,000-ton battlecruiser at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, which will be named "New Jersey." The Brooklyn Navy Yard also began construction of a battlecruiser a few weeks ago. (Haitong Electric dispatch on the 17th)

### Soviet Youth Eager to Enlist; Newly Built Amphibious Aircraft Test Flown in Moscow

Moscow - The first day of conscription for the Soviet Red Army and Navy proved the Soviet people's fervent patriotic sentiment. Countless patriotic young people have already secured positions in various units. According to Chernikov, Director of the Moscow City Military Commission, "One hundred percent of the first conscripts reported on time. The results of the work of the Moscow Conscription Committee confirm that the new recruits to the Soviet army are extremely qualified. All conscripts are physically strong young men, some of whom were prevented from enlisting, but they all refused exemptions." (TASS dispatch on the 17th)

Moscow - The Soviet Union's newly built amphibious monoplane had its initial test flight over Moscow today, with very satisfactory results. This aircraft can carry four passengers, has a speed of 140 miles per hour, and a range of 8,000 miles, intended for flying across the ocean. (Hava Khan Electric dispatch on the 16th)

U.S. Says Soviet Union Ready to Counter German Threat

Military experts here in Washington recently stated that the Soviet Union is now prepared to resist the German threat to its borders and wants to create the greatest possible influence in European politics. The Soviet Union's mobilization of the third-tier army is for this reason. Moscow believes that the opportunity to exert maximum pressure on Balkan politics in European politics has matured, and the time to take precautionary measures to prevent aggression on the eastern border has also arrived. However, this step by the Soviet Union can also be said to be a reaction of unease caused by the current uneasy situation in Europe. At a time when preparations are prevalent in countries around the world, the Soviet Union's mobilization of these third-tier new troops will inevitably be regarded as a very important move. The relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan has recently appeared calm due to Japan's attention to the progress in Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies in the south. Recently, the attitude of Americans toward the Soviet Union has been very complicated, but the United States may be able to approach the Soviet Union because the Soviet Union occupies an important position in Asia, which the United States can use to resist militarist Japan. However, American friendship with the Soviet Union has been greatly affected by the German-Soviet non-aggression pact and the Soviet invasion of Finland. (United Press dispatch on the 17th)

### New York Prepares Fundraising Campaign to Relieve War-Zone Refugees in China

New York - Yesterday, preparations were made here to carry out the third phase of the "Rice Bowl Movement" to relieve war-zone refugees in China. Colonel Roosevelt, who is in charge of the movement, has sent documents to New York Mayor La Guardia, appointing the mayor as chairman of the committee to carry out the third phase of the national fundraising campaign. This phase of the campaign is scheduled to end on November 1. At that time, New York City will hold a "Rice Bowl" dinner dance at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel and a picnic in Chinatown. The appointed chairmen of other New York branches include Mr. Tulanmu, the general manager of the National Broadcasting Corporation, who will serve as chairman of the radio broadcasting committee, and the famous newspaper publisher Mr. Huaide, who will serve as director of the propaganda department. (United Press dispatch on the 17th)

### Pacific Institute Observes Dutch East Indies' Solid Coastal Defense; Training Reserves to Deal with Aggression; Purchasing Aircraft from U.S. to Strengthen Air Defense; Economic Negotiations with Japan Began Yesterday

San Francisco - According to the observation of the Institute of Pacific Relations, the Dutch East Indies' ability to resist aggression is actually stronger than generally imagined. Since 1933, the authorities have been extremely secretive about the defense of the Dutch East Indies. Unofficial sources say that the naval strength there is one battleship, three cruisers, eight destroyers, eighteen submarines, and forty-two torpedo boats. The naval community has already recognized submarines as the best weapons for coastal defense, especially useful for small countries without large fleets. It is well known that the number of submarines currently in the Dutch East Indies is sufficient to cope with any maritime attack, and it is felt that they are more than capable of bombing transport ships intending to land troops. The reason for this is that there are not many military ports on the island. As far as investigators know, the destroyers and mine-laying ships of the Dutch East Indies have a special feature in their construction: several aircraft can be parked on the deck. Since the establishment of two large gasoline plants on the island, there is no longer a shortage of oil. The Dutch East Indies is confident in its air defense, especially regarding bombing ships. The island has various types of aircraft, including "Ma"-type, Kehuowen-type, Foxian-type, and various German types. In the forests of the Malay Archipelago, the authorities have excellent military bases and secret airfields. The land forces are equipped with Vickers anti-aircraft guns. According to investigations, several years ago, the Dutch East Indies purchased a large number of aircraft from major European countries to strengthen its national defense. Recently, the Dutch East Indies government purchased a large number of American aircraft. In 1938, 104 aircraft were imported, 66 of which were purchased from the United States. The local People's Congress recently passed a motion to purchase another 250 bombers. Before the Netherlands was invaded, the Dutch East Indies army numbered 50,000. Since then, the training of reserves has become increasingly active. The Dutch East Indies used to rely on its mother country in everything, but today it is striving for autonomy. To implement this policy, the necessary organizations have already been established locally. These organizations include a National Mobilization Congress and a Ministry of Finance to control wartime shipping safety, the establishment of coastal observation posts, and all facilities for exchanging information with the maritime fleet in wartime. In addition, considerable steps have also been taken to protect merchant ships and resist poison gas with mine-laying ships and radiation fish. All of these are enough to make the Dutch East Indies capable of dealing with any aggression from any direction with ease. (United Press dispatch on the 17th)

Tokyo - Semi-official Japanese sources say that formal negotiations between the Dutch East Indies and Japan on resolving economic issues began today in Batavia. The initial meeting between Japanese special envoy Xiao and Dutch authorities lasted one and a half hours. No communique has been issued regarding the progress of the talks. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

### The Executive Yuan Decides to Establish a Wartime Capital Construction Planning Committee to Plan the Construction of Greater Chongqing in Detail

Chongqing - At a meeting on the 17th, the Executive Yuan decided to organize a Wartime Capital Construction Planning Committee to plan the construction of Greater Chongqing in detail. (Dispatch on the 17th)

### Situation of Japanese Aircraft Raids on Chongqing the Previous Day

Chongqing - Yesterday, from 8:30 AM to 2:00 PM, Japanese aircraft raided Chongqing four times in several hours. At 9:15 AM, nine Japanese bombers attacked the western suburbs of Chongqing, destroying the Central Bank office. Near noon, three more groups of Japanese aircraft, nine aircraft in each group, bombed the northern bank of the Jialing River and the southern bank of the Yangtze River in the western suburbs. The Japanese have now changed their tactics from large-scale, intensive attacks to using fewer aircraft to maintain continuous bombing. During the second air raid alarm from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, some Japanese aircraft dropped bombs on the northern bank of the Jialing River. No engine sounds were heard, but the sound of exploding bombs was heard. The Japanese aircraft apparently stopped their engines and glided through the sky. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

### Sudden Change in Weather; German Invasion of England Not Yet Realized; Dense Fog at Sea, Strong Winds and High Waves; British Wait in Full Battle Array, Unafraid of Invasion

London - Most qualified observers believe that last night (September 16), with a full moon and high tide, was the day chosen by the German leaders to invade England. Unexpectedly, the weather changed suddenly yesterday. A strong southeasterly wind blew across the Dover Strait, very fiercely, and did not stop all night. Dense fog covered the sea, and nothing could be seen beyond a mile. In addition, the dark clouds were low, the sky was dim, and there was continuous rain along the coast. The situation near the coast today remains the same as yesterday. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

London - This morning (Shanghai time), the English Channel was shrouded in fog, the wind was strong, and the waves were gradually increasing. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

London - According to a highly placed official in the government, speaking to a reporter from the United Press, the Cabinet is still waiting vigilantly for the German threat to invade England. He said, "We still believe that a German invasion of England is possible every hour, but we have the ability to inflict heavy damage on the other side." At the same time, because the "Crisis Weekend" has passed without any incident, neutral experts here believe that the threat of invasion of England may gradually decrease day by day. Another neutral expert said, "The German delay in invading England may be due to conflicts among senior German commanders, the German aircraft's inability to repel the British Royal Air Force, or the British Air Force's too fierce intrusion into the French coast, all of which are unknown." (United Press dispatch on the 17th)

New York - According to sources here, German troop transport ships are still lurking along the French coast, apparently preparing to invade England. However, the sudden turn for the worse in the weather and the British Air Force's tireless fighting have led people to speculate again that Hitler has something to worry about and will wait until next spring. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

Madrid - According to reports here, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels recently told Belgian newspaper reporters that the war against England could be declared over in a few weeks, and that the offensive against the British Isles would only take three weeks or a month.

### German Aircraft Attack England Day and Night; London Suffers Another Horrific Bombing; Thousands and Hundreds of Various Bombs Dropped; Major Damage to Commercial and Residential Areas

New York - London lifted the air raid alarm at 5:25 this morning after an unprecedented and most destructive air raid all night. The number of bombs dropped exceeded previous air raids. A certain square in the center of London was hit by bombs seven times. Anti-aircraft fire was also very fierce. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

London - Today, the German Air Force continued its attempt to seize air control of Britain, dropping thousands and hundreds of various bombs on London and other places. London residents have virtually had no sleep because small groups of German aircraft have continuously rotated bombings, making London in air raid alarms throughout last night and this morning. The Midlands, the northeast and southeast of England, and South Wales have all been heavily attacked. Many residential areas in London had time bombs dropped last night, and many streets were closed to traffic to avoid danger. Several places in London caught fire, but they were extinguished. Since suffering a huge loss of 185 aircraft on Sunday, the German aircraft have apparently been using a new type of square bombing formation in recent air raids, but the British anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes can still disperse them in minutes. Casualties of the entire population have been very light, but material damage has been quite large. Some houses, shops, and other buildings have been destroyed in the London area, and a hospital was hit by a bomb. This morning, a German aircraft suddenly swooped down from the clouds over a certain town in the southeast and dropped several bombs in the downtown area, causing great losses and many casualties. Residents of London took refuge in air-raid shelters all night, and this morning, with the sound of the all-clear, they hurriedly had a quick breakfast and rushed to work at 8:12 with the sound of the third alarm. According to a joint communique from the Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Internal Security, today's first alarm in London was at 2:52 AM and lasted a very short time, but the German aircraft dropped bombs in many places in Greater London and the suburbs, and several places caught fire, but they were quickly extinguished. A hospital was hit by a bomb, but fortunately there were no casualties. A second alarm was issued at 7:02 AM. The German aircraft dropped several high-explosive bombs in the suburbs of London, destroying a few houses and causing slight casualties. The alarm was lifted at 7:48 AM. At the same time, several other batches of German aircraft raided various parts of England. Several incendiary bombs fell in a certain area in northeastern England. Towns in the Midlands and the Northeast were also attacked, with slight losses and casualties. Rural areas in South Wales were bombed by German aircraft, but the general damage was not great.

### Goering Flew to England for Inspection; Sky Offensive to be Intensified

Berlin - According to sources familiar with the matter, this agency has learned that German Air Force Commander-in-Chief Marshal Goering personally attacked London in an aircraft on Saturday night. Marshal Goering's headquarters are located in a small village in Normandy, France. From there, the German Air Force issues orders for the attack on England. He also directs the air defense measures in Germany and the occupied areas, strategizing with his senior staff every day, and has repeatedly achieved remarkable results. On Saturday night, Goering personally flew the latest type of Zhou 88 bomber, escorted by only two fighter planes. Goering, on his return from inspecting London after the bombing, said, "The sharpness of the German Air Force can be said to be satisfactory. Since the German Air Force is the decisive factor in Poland, Norway, and the Western Front, there is no doubt that it is the sharp sword for fighting against England." (Haitong Electric dispatch on the 17th)

Berlin - German officials also said today that after Air Force General Goering returned from reconnaissance of London in a giant bomber, he has ordered a doubling of air raids on the British Isles. (International News Service dispatch on the 17th)

### German Aircraft Groups Break Through Dense Fog, Madly Bombarding Central London

London - German Air Force personnel last night broke through the strong defense line of London in heavy rain and dense fog, making it the largest attack since the British army adopted new anti-aircraft guns last Wednesday. Dozens of German bombers continued to carry out the task that the previous five bombings of London had not completed, flying over central London, the sound of the engines continuous. The German aircraft responded to the sound of the British anti-aircraft guns with hissing bombs. The dark, foggy night was disturbed by the sound of high-explosive blasts, and shrapnel flew everywhere. The fire of buildings on the ground rose up from time to time, breaking through the dense fog. The German aircraft were forced to fly blindly, dropping bombs in the clouds and fog over London. Bombs fell one after another in central London. The buildings in the London commercial district were illuminated by magnesium and incendiary bombs, contrasting with the black night and military fog, which was very beautiful. (International News Service dispatch on the 17th)

London - Hitler's aircraft group again carried out the most brutal air raid on London last night. In the three hours after the German aircraft began the night attack on London, thousands and hundreds of bombs were scattered all over the British capital. The British anti-aircraft gun team also showed its great power when the German aircraft wantonly dropped incendiary and high-explosive bombs in the north, west, southeast, and other parts of the city. By 11:00 PM (7:00 AM Shanghai Summer Time), the German aircraft seemed to have changed their style again, acting alone or in small groups, but flying into London from all directions, and flying lower than the previous two nights. The shopping areas of London were heavily bombed by German aircraft last night. According to official estimates, since the start of the blitz attack on London, which has been nine days, Germany has lost 465 aircraft and 1,140 airmen, while the British have lost a total of 96 aircraft and 57 airmen. Yesterday's German air raid on England seemed to focus more on London than other raids. The underground passages of railway stations were crowded with people again, and there were still thousands of people living on the platforms of the stations, hoping to get a moment of sleep, even if the trains passed by, they did not feel the noise. One street in the city of London had its road surface destroyed by bombs and was impassable. The glass windows of all the buildings in the main shopping areas were shattered. The most severe London bombing yesterday afternoon was in the densely populated east, northeast, and south. (United Press dispatch on the 17th)

### British Aircraft Repeatedly Attacked, German Military Areas Under Attack, and Coastal Port Facilities in Belgium and France Damaged

London - British bombers engaged in extensive activity on the night of the 15th and the early morning of the 16th, attacking German centers for the invasion of England along the Channel and within the borders of Holland and Germany. Berlin was also heavily attacked again by British aircraft, with military targets in the northwest of the city, the Daemmerhof airfield (a major aircraft port in Schellin), and previously damaged power stations all bombed. According to the Ministry of Aviation, British aircraft encountered anti-aircraft fire on their way to attack, but none were hit. The residents of Berlin were alarmed twice in one night. At that time, Berlin was experiencing thunderstorms, causing one of the two engines of a British bomber attacking the Daemmerhof airfield to suddenly malfunction as it approached the target. However, the pilot continued flying, dropped bombs on the airfield, and then maintained an altitude of 5,000 feet with only one engine. After forty-five minutes, the other engine started. British aircraft also heavily bombed Hamburg, Wilhelmshaven, Antwerp, Flushing, Ostend, Dunkirk, Calais, and Boulogne's military supply stations and ships. Other British bombers attacked supply distribution centers such as Hamm, warehouses in Hamburg, and railway junctions on the Rhine. An enemy warship outside the island of Schiermonnikoog in the West Frisian Islands was also attacked, with one direct hit. An oil tanker and a supply ship at the mouth of the Elbe were also severely damaged. British coastal aircraft sank an enemy supply ship of 5,000 tons anchored in the Dutch port of IJmuiden. A convoy off the coast of Holland was attacked, sinking two supply ships and severely damaging several others. The docks and ships in Le Havre were also repeatedly bombed. All British aircraft returned safely. The most severely bombed area that night was the Antwerp dockyard, which was attacked twice. Many ships had gathered there in recent weeks, and British aircraft began bombing at 10:30 PM, lasting for three hours. Initially, the moonlight was bright, and although the British aircraft encountered fierce resistance from ground defenses, they still flew to their destination. Ships were bombed and blazed with fire, illuminating the entire Antwerp dockyard. By 12:30 AM, a major pier was engulfed in flames, and fires were also seen in other places. However, British aircraft continued to bomb. The British aircraft that arrived later dropped heavy bombs on the dock basin, piers, and ships. One hour after the last British aircraft flew away from the burning dockyard, looking back from several miles away, the blazing fire was still visible.

Ships and dockyards in Ostend were continuously attacked by British aircraft for over four hours. A large transport ship was hit and caught fire. British bombers attacking Boulogne used the bright moonlight to bomb their targets. Dunkirk was hit by British medium and heavy bombers, which dropped bombs on the dockyards and port facilities, causing severe damage. A violent explosion occurred at one dockyard, and the flames shot up, visible from twenty miles away. Calais and Flushing were attacked, with fires breaking out in many places. When British aircraft attacked the long-range gun emplacements at Cap Gris-Nez near Calais, the surrounding woods were hit and caught fire, causing the emplacements to be surrounded by flames.

Regarding the British aircraft's attacks on the German convoys concentrated in the Channel, according to the intelligence department of the Ministry of Aviation, a Hudson-type British aircraft was the first to attack a convoy off the Dutch coast, diving down and sinking one ship, and then strafing an armed vessel and a torpedo boat escorting the convoy. At dawn the next day, another convoy anchored off the Dutch coast was attacked by a patrolling Hudson-type British aircraft. The aircraft dived down and dropped three heavy bombs on a ship escorting the convoy, at least one of which hit, sending debris flying high. The ship sank immediately. Separate groups of British Hampden aircraft raided German ships concentrated in various ports along the Channel at night. A convoy near Calais was bombed by British bombers, and two ships were damaged. However, the main force of British aircraft attacked Le Havre. The first batch of Hampden aircraft arriving at the port saw four ships moored in front of the deep-water wharf, and repeatedly dropped bombs, hitting the wharf and causing a fire. The second batch of British aircraft, using the moonlight, saw the wharf and the ships next to it, and dived down to bomb despite intense anti-aircraft fire. The ships exploded immediately, and the wharf warehouses were also damaged by the bombs. The German railway center was also attacked and severely damaged. In Hamm, the center of German railway transportation, six buildings were hit and collapsed, and freight trains were also attacked. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

London - Responsible sources here declared that due to excessively bad weather last night, the British Air Force did not depart to bomb German military targets and Hitler's preparations for aggression. This has been the case only a few times in recent weeks. It is said that the weather conditions last night were unfavorable for accurate bombing. It would not be impossible to carry out indiscriminate bombing, but the British Air Force's systematic attack plan is not aimed at that. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Black Eagle Willing to Duel Goering in the Air, Claiming the Latter Has Accepted the Challenge; German Side Dismisses as Absurd and Groundless

New York - Colonel "Black Eagle" Julian declared last night that General Goering, the German Minister of Aviation, has accepted his challenge to a duel at 10,000 feet above the English Channel. This Black aviator stated that his aerial duel with General Goering will be held within thirty days. He said, "I will mow down the life of this fool with machine guns. We only die once, and I have resolved to sacrifice myself." "Black Eagle" said that after reading Hitler's "Mein Kampf," he telegraphed Goering to challenge him. Colonel Julian said that Hitler insulted the Black race, calling them "grotesque blockheads, half-apes." He said his wife received a phone call from Washington on Saturday from someone who said, "This is the military attaché of the German Embassy. Tell the Black pig that his challenge has been accepted and he should come to the chosen location." Colonel Julian said he would buy one of the two German Messerschmitt fighter planes that the British government recently put up for sale, saying, "Only by dueling with him in the same type of plane can we avoid the problem of unequal equipment." (Associated Press dispatch, 17th)

Washington - The German Embassy informed the press last night that the claim by American Black pilot Colonel Julian that General Goering had accepted his challenge to a duel in the air above the English Channel within a month is not true. A spokesman for the German Embassy considered the "Black Eagle's" talk to be "absurd and baseless." (Associated Press dispatch, 17th)

### Spanish Minister of the Interior Visits Berlin, Meets Hitler; This Trip Has Great Political Significance; Italian Colonial Minister Also Visits Germany at the Same Time

Berlin - German Führer Hitler received Spanish Minister of the Interior Suner at the Chancellery at 11:30 AM this morning, and Suner did not leave until 1:00 PM. Suner was introduced by the German Director of Protocol, Doernberg. When he left, a crowd gathered in front of the Chancellery to welcome him. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)

Berlin - Spanish Minister of the Interior Suner has now arrived here and is being treated as a guest of the German government. According to a German news agency, Suner told German reporters that Spain's position is currently that of a non-belligerent country, but it should not be regarded as indifferent to the war. Spain has its own task in the new European order. When the time is ripe, Spain will issue an order to mobilize. Regarding the issue of Spanish territory, Spain has no demands in Europe, because the term "demand" cannot be applied to true restoration. Spain has driven away those who previously intended to control its destiny and is enjoying freedom. Spain is not isolated in Europe, and the empire that Spain's policy aims at cannot be realized by Spain alone. This matter requires coordination with other countries. When Spain seeks comrades in the future, Spain will only turn to those who have suffered unjust treatment. No one will find this strange. His visit to Germany now is a subtle indication that Spain is still faithfully adhering to its natural policy. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

Berlin - Spanish Minister of the Interior Suner arrived here yesterday, and German newspapers all published articles welcoming him. The "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" stated that Suner is a talented politician of the new Spain and is therefore able to grasp great power and serve as Minister of the Interior. The "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" stated that the new Spain has been revived from the civil war, and Suner's contribution has been the greatest. He is the most appropriate person to speak on behalf of Führer Franco. The Nazi Party's newspaper "Der Angriff" stated that Suner's meeting with Führer Hitler is of great significance. Before his departure, Suner declared in Madrid that this visit is of great significance, and those currently visiting Berlin are participating in a historical undertaking. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)

Cairo - A communiqué issued here last night stated that the main force of the enemy seems to be consolidating its positions around Sollum, but large enemy armored vehicles have already come into contact with the vanguard of the British army around Buq Buq. Yesterday, the British Air Force and mobile artillery harassed the enemy with considerable success. The rest of the front line was quiet. A communiqué issued by the British Air Force stated that British bombers and fighters were active in Libya and the Western Desert area on Sunday. British fighters shot down six enemy bombers, which has been confirmed. Another three enemy aircraft may also have been lost. One British aircraft did not return. Last night, British aircraft attacked a large enemy motorized transport column near Buq Buq. The gasoline was hit and caught fire, and the firelight was visible from a hundred miles away. Yesterday, a motorized enemy column east of Buq Buq was moving east and was bombed by British aircraft.

Rome - The Italian and German General Staffs today launched a triple offensive against the British positions in Egypt, Kenya, and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Mussolini's plan to establish a new empire in Africa seems to have reached a mature stage. Today, it was officially announced that the Italian army in Abyssinia is now advancing south towards Kenya and west towards Sudan, while at the same time, the great offensive advancing towards Egypt from Libya has also been victorious. Italian newspapers all published the news of the Italian joint attack on the British African front lines on the front page with large headlines. The Italian High Command today stated that Italian mechanized units, in order to "liberate Egypt and the Suez Canal," have broken through the first British defense line east of Sollum. The communiqué stated that more than fifty British tanks and armored vehicles have been captured by the rapidly advancing Italian vanguard. The Italian Air Force continues its destructive attacks on British ships in the Mediterranean Sea and bombed Malta four times over the weekend. The newspapers here have detailed explanations of the strategic importance of the current Italian military operations and said that the scope of the war is gradually intensifying and expanding. Gedda, a recognized mouthpiece of Mussolini, wrote an editorial on the decisive battle in Egypt, stating that Italy's military operations are intended to liberate the African people. Gedda said that African lands bordering Italy that are under British rule are now under attack. The Italian army has been victorious everywhere and has crossed the old borders.

(International dispatch, 17th)

Rome - Although Italy has launched an offensive against Egypt, it will temporarily refrain from declaring war on Egypt. According to responsible sources in Italy, Italy's goal is to fight against the British army in Egypt, not to make things difficult for Egypt. As for the British using Egypt as a base to counter Italian interests, Italy naturally cannot recognize it. Therefore, the Italian army has taken action to enter Egyptian territory. The outside world generally believes that Italy's move has started a war and attempts to invade Egypt, but this is not Italy's purpose in fighting. (Associated Press dispatch, 17th)

New York - "The New York Times" today specially published a news item stating that the Australian army stationed in Egypt is practicing landing tactics.

### Tokyo Water Shortage, City's Water Tower Storage Insufficient for Two Weeks

Tokyo - Japan is experiencing a major drought this year, coupled with the expansion of munitions workers here, numbering over one million, so the water shortage problem is quite serious. This is a rare phenomenon in recent years in this peaceful capital. The water stored in the city's reservoirs is only enough for two weeks, and the annual rainy season only brings sunshine and cloudless skies. The authorities have enforced a compulsory reduction in water consumption, closing the sluice gates for sixteen hours a day, only opening them twice, from 4:00 AM to 8:00 AM and from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM, and the water flow is not very smooth. However, under this restriction, it has increased unnecessary consumption, because all users take advantage of the opening period to store as much water as possible in bathtubs and all other vessels that can hold water. If it is not used up, the remaining water flows into the sewers. Some do not close the faucets because they cannot get water, so when the main water gate is opened, a large amount of water is wasted. In view of this, the authorities have increased the number of opening times and shortened the opening period. Some people believe that this may remedy previous losses, but it still needs to be seen how effective it is. The danger of fire is also increasing day by day, because the water level is lowered, the water pressure is reduced, the water does not shoot high, and it is not easy to extinguish the fire. In addition, the spread of smallpox and typhoid fever, and the panic of hospitals lacking water for emergency operations, are also becoming increasingly dangerous. Only a heavy downpour can stop the development of this serious situation. (International News Agency dispatch, 17th)

### Further Discussions on the European War (8): German Troops Arrive at the Spanish Border

The following is an airmail dispatch from the European correspondent of the New York Herald Tribune, dated July 7th from the French border, describing the first historical arrival of German troops at the Spanish border. It is translated as follows:

The arrival of German troops at the Spanish border is a first in history. Even during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, German troops did not advance this far south. To celebrate this event, German officers held a joint banquet with Spanish officers in Biarritz, France, near the border, and also commemorated the victory of General Franco in the Spanish Civil War with the assistance of the "Condor" Legion of the Nazi Party.

The Basque coastal resort of Saint-Jean-de-Luz, with its beautiful scenery, is filled with German soldiers, although there is not a single German ship at the harbor entrance. The Grand Hotel there has been rented by the German army as its headquarters, and the swastika flag is flying in the wind on the flagpole on the roof.

The German troops arrived there on June 37th. The day before, the mayor had posted notices everywhere, advising residents not to engage in any demonstrations against the occupying forces.

The residents were able to strictly abide by the mayor's orders. The residents of Saint-Jean-de-Luz regarded the arrival of the German troops as if they did not see them, and there were no demonstrations. As far as the reporter knows, the German troops were also able to maintain strict discipline.

This is not to say that the shadow or the sound of the German troops was not seen or heard. That is not the case. Soldiers in uniform were everywhere. They demanded the evacuation of larger guesthouses for their accommodation, and in front of the hotels, there were helmeted guards standing watch. The sound of their heavy black leather boots constantly echoed on the steps. They also appeared in the shops, using their stiff and simple French to buy goods from the shop assistants who had been experiencing slow business for a long time, calculating the exchange rate at twenty francs to one mark. They also went to restaurants in groups to enjoy the exquisite French cuisine and fine wines. Their food and accommodation in the hotels were provided by the French government, that is to say, since the Pétain government assumed responsibility for the expenses of the German occupation, the French taxpayers should bear all of this.

In addition, there was singing – the German troops, when they marched in formation, sang constantly from morning to night. As soon as they woke up in the morning, they sang a song about England in a majestic tone. The reporter did not understand the meaning of the song they were singing, but it was obviously not complimentary to England. Most of the songs they sang were naturally praising their motherland. When they were not singing, they always played military music, and there was a military band playing on the hotel terrace every night.

During the reporter's several inspections of the front lines, he never heard French soldiers singing. They seemed not to be enthusiastic about this war, and there was no famous "Madelon" marching song like in the last war. This may be one of the reasons for France's defeat, although it is a very unimportant reason.

The German soldiers did indeed enjoy themselves to the fullest in this city. In addition to indulging in wine and food, they swam in the ocean every morning. The only thing they lacked was socializing with women. When American soldiers occupied the Rhineland in the past, they immediately had social interactions with German women, and many of them married German wives. But German soldiers have not yet courted the women of Saint-Jean-de-Luz; they still go out for walks with their own brothers.

It is not that these young Nazi soldiers have not made a deep impression on the local French residents. They certainly did make a deep impression on the French residents. Their youth, their beauty, their energy, and their good health provided the local residents with a lot of material for conversation. The French residents began to understand the reason why French soldiers, although brave, were ultimately no match for the Germans.

A French girl, when she saw these fair-haired, white-skinned soldiers from the Rhine, could not help but sigh, "France can be said to have no youth." She is not entirely wrong. French youth mature too quickly; they seem to have no youth. According to the meaning of youth in German soldiers or American college undergraduates, French youth are indeed without vigor. France's lack of emphasis on the physical education of the younger generation is indeed a pity. In French schools, too much time is spent on the intellectual education of children, but not enough attention is paid to their physical development.

The German occupation of Saint-Jean-de-Luz, apart from changing the time to German time, has not imposed any other harsh restrictions. If this change were implemented immediately and remained unchanged, it might not be such a bad thing. But first it was changed to Central European Time, then to French Daylight Saving Time, and finally to German Time. As a result, there was a period of confusion. At one time, the Saint-Jean-de-Luz railway station observed German time, while the municipal government still observed French time. It was extremely difficult to make appointments, and it was often necessary to ask specifically whether the agreed time was German time or French time.

The time is now changed, at least during the German occupation, and the local residents have already passively accepted it. This has extended the daylight hours. The sun does not set into the sea until after 10 p.m.

In addition to the German troops stationed in the suburbs, there were also large numbers of refugees from France and Belgium. The influx of refugees was so large that many shops had to limit the number of customers allowed inside at any one time. The queues of people entering the shops often made the customers waiting in line anxious.

Before the German invasion, this water city had many British tourists. These tourists were later evacuated hastily by British ships. The harbor of Saint-Jean-de-Luz has never been as busy as it was before and after the arrival of the German troops. Giant ocean liners were anchored outside the harbor, preparing to transport British refugees, and the destroyers escorting these liners were constantly moving back and forth outside the breakwater. The French residents were deeply afraid that the presence of these liners would attract German aircraft under the command of General Göring to bomb the city. The local residents at that time hoped for heavy rain and dark clouds, because bad weather was indeed a blessing for this seaside resort.

During the same period, there were five hundred Americans who also left the port, transporting luggage and belongings by car through Hendaye, across the border, to Spain. The evacuation of American expatriates was coordinated by officials from the American Embassy in Spain, who, upon arriving in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, were hailed as saviors by their stranded compatriots. For several days, the American expatriates had surrounded the Portuguese and Spanish consulates in Bayonne in order to obtain passports to leave the country, but they were unable to obtain them. It turned out that the streets in front of the consulates of the two countries were crowded all day long with terrified refugees from various countries, and the Americans had to retreat, knowing that it was impossible to succeed.

Even those American refugees who were fortunate enough to obtain passports and walked to the Hendaye International Bridge, thinking that they could reach neutral Spain without being hindered, found that the reality was very different. The cars carrying refugees waiting to pass through in front of the International Bridge stretched for a mile. The French allowed only about three cars per hour to cross the border. Some American expatriates arrived at the International Bridge at 2 p.m. on Saturday, but after forty-eight hours, sleeping in their cars for two nights, they had not moved forward even a step. If the American Embassy in Madrid had not come to their rescue, they might still have had to wait there for some time.

An American woman who had been waiting here for twenty-four hours was terrified because Reverend William, of the American Church in Paris, had deposited the original manuscript of his sermon against the Nazi Party in her car. When she suddenly thought that the German troops might come to the International Bridge and find this manuscript, which was a scathing denunciation of the Nazi Party, her heart was filled with the terror of being thrown into a concentration camp.

At present, only a few Americans remain in Saint-Jean-de-Luz. Most of them want to return to Paris. However, since the trains are not yet running, the most serious problem for them to return to Paris is the problem of obtaining gasoline. The first request of the German troops was that all the remaining locomotives in France be placed under German control, and gasoline has also become a rare commodity. The shortage of gasoline makes it necessary for American expatriates to economize when taking cars down the mountain.

At the same time, the local residents do not know what the situation is outside. There has been very little news in the French newspapers recently. Apart from knowing that businessman Wendell Willkie had become the Republican presidential candidate last month, the local expatriates know nothing else.

Because of the lack of news, rumors flourish. These rumors, at least within twenty-four hours, are believed by some to have some superficial value. The rumor-mongers have their own motives, and those who believe the rumors also hope that they are true. For the past two weeks, the reporter has been despised by those who believe the rumors for disbelieving them. They often say, "Oh, you are a journalist, haven't you heard the latest news?"

The following are some of the rumors that have been circulating in Saint-Jean-de-Luz since the signing of the armistice agreement between France and Germany:

(1) The United States has already declared war on Germany.

(2) The Soviet Union has already declared war on Germany.

(3) German troops have joined forces with Spanish troops for the purpose of attacking Gibraltar and have now entered Spain.

(4) The entry of German troops into Spain is for the purpose of attacking Portugal, which has been an ally of England for many years.

(5) France has clearly refused the entry of German troops into Spain and has arrested the Spanish officers who came to Biarritz to celebrate with the German troops.

(6) The British Air Force has bombed Berlin. In one air raid, three thousand Germans were killed, and the British vanguard has landed in Hamburg.

And so on, and so forth. The local situation is truly like a rumor factory.

### Increased Security in the Two Concessions; Shanghai Citizens Highly Encouraged; Police, Defense Forces, and Volunteer Corps Mobilized Simultaneously; Curfew Strictly Enforced for the Past Two Nights

Regarding the increased security measures taken in the Public Concession and the French Concession in recent days, as previously reported in this newspaper, it is now known that the police authorities of the two concessions and the defense forces of various countries are continuing their security measures today and will strictly enforce the curfew to maintain order. Therefore, the citizens of the entire city are highly encouraged. The details are reported separately as follows:

Joint Patrols by Military and Police

The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Police Department has decided to implement special security measures along the borders and within the concession starting at 5:00 AM this morning and has consulted with the American and Italian defense forces stationed in Shanghai to dispatch troops and patrols within their original defense areas. In addition to the mobilization of all police officers, special constables will also be called to participate, and some roads will be blocked. As for the French Concession, security has been further tightened today since the implementation of temporary emergency security measures. The French Concession Volunteer Corps has also been ordered to mobilize.

Volunteer Corps Units Ordered to Assist in Defense

Furthermore, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps (SVC) of the Public Concession issued orders yesterday from the SVC headquarters to prepare for defense. However, the A Company of the SVC will continue to be responsible for defense in the Hongkou (虹口) and western districts from the 15th to the 26th of this month. The Chinese Company, the American Company (i.e., B Company), the Cavalry, the Armored Car Company, the Machine Gun Company, the Jewish Company, the Filipino Company, the Portuguese Company, and the White Russian Company have been called up and will all be in uniform, awaiting orders to deploy. The deployment time will be from 5:00 AM this morning until 12:30 AM tonight.

French Concession Decides to Continue Security Measures

The French Concession has been under temporary emergency security measures for almost half a month. The French defense forces stationed in Shanghai have also been deployed, and most of the roads along the borders of the two concessions have been blocked, such as Rue du Consulat (天主堂街), Rue Chapsal (處洽卿路), Route Cardinal Mercier (南成都路), and Haig Road (海格路). The French defense forces have also been stationed in various forts. According to sources close to the matter, the authorities of the French Concession have no plans to lift these security measures and will make a decision based on the evolution of the situation.

Authorities Prohibit Assemblies and Parades

As of yesterday, all schools, clubs, and social organizations in Shanghai have received notifications from the SMC Police Department, instructing them not to hold any public assemblies. At the same time, all parades are also prohibited. Most schools have also been closed for one day. This is because the school authorities, considering the strict security measures in Shanghai and the many inconveniences for students traveling to and from school, do not want to be held responsible for unexpected incidents related to the safety of students.

Large-Scale Arrests of Suspected Criminals

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that the SMC Police Department launched a surprise attack on undesirable elements in the city this morning (the 17th) and conducted a large-scale search of warehouses and hotels in the Putu Road (普渡路) area, arresting twenty or thirty suspected criminals. It is believed that this move by the Police Department is one of the security measures taken by the Shanghai authorities to prevent unexpected incidents. However, the police refused to disclose any information about the arrests, presumably because the Police Department will continue to conduct searches this afternoon and evening.

Midnight Curfew Strictly Enforced

At the same time, Shanghai will once again become an armed encampment tonight at midnight. The military police and volunteer corps are all scheduled to begin security measures at midnight to prevent any unexpected incidents from occurring. Police sources have stated that the curfew will be strictly enforced on the nights of the 17th and 18th. After midnight, any pedestrians on the streets will be detained and taken to the police station, to be released at 5:00 AM the next morning. Furthermore, nightclubs in the Public Concession will only be open until midnight on the 17th and 18th. Foreign troops will patrol their respective defense areas tomorrow, and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will continue to conduct defense operations in the "B" defense area.

### One-Yuan Notes and Subsidiary Coins Sufficient for Circulation; Total Value Exceeds Ten Million Yuan

In order to regulate the supply of subsidiary coins and one-yuan notes in the Shanghai market, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank have been granted special permission by the Ministry of Finance to (1) issue one-cent and five-cent subsidiary coin notes by the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank and (2) issue one-cent and five-cent aluminum coins by the Shanghai Bankers' Association. In addition, foreign banks have been entrusted to transport subsidiary coin notes and one-yuan notes to Shanghai for issuance. These include the new one-dime and two-dime notes of the Farmers Bank of China, the new edition of one-dime and two-dime subsidiary coin notes of the Bank of China, and the new one-yuan notes of the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Bank of China, and the Farmers Bank. It is reported that the total value of these notes and coins that have arrived in Shanghai is already over ten million yuan, which is sufficient to meet the demand for small change in the Shanghai market and to curb the illegal discounted trading by opium and money changers. In the future, there should be no more shortages or panic. Those who wish to obtain subsidiary coin notes and aluminum coins can apply directly to the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank and the Banknote Issuing Reserve Committee in accordance with the prescribed procedures.

### Lecture on Chinese Antiques

The Shanghai Rotary Club will hold its regular weekly meeting on Thursday, September 19th, at noon at the Metropole Hotel. At that time, Mr. Johncan, a member of the club, will give a lecture on the topic of "Collecting Chinese Antiques," which has been his lifelong hobby. If members wish to invite friends to attend, please notify the club by telephone (16450) before Wednesday morning to avoid overcrowding and delay the meeting. Members from other cities are welcome to attend.

### The Isolated Battalion Incident Should Be Resolved Fairly; Shanghai Municipal Council Scheduled to Discuss Today; Colonel Xie's Letter to Newspapers Details the Truth

Regarding the conflict that occurred in the Isolated Battalion (孤軍營) on the 14th, after the second round of negotiations between the two parties ended without results the day before yesterday, the situation has reached a standstill. Although the Isolated Battalion has made demands such as the removal of the blockade and the restoration of freedom, whether these demands can be met depends on the attitude of the Shanghai Municipal Council. It is reported that the Council, in order to seek a solution, will submit the matter for discussion and decision at today's board meeting. People from all walks of life in Shanghai have high hopes for this meeting, hoping that a fair solution can be found soon. The strict blockade of the Isolated Battalion was not lifted yesterday. White Russian guards rotated every half hour, taking turns on duty, guarding the perimeter of the barracks. The installation of searchlights, after working through the night, was completed at midnight the day before yesterday and was also turned on briefly, with the light reaching dozens of feet away.

Council Hopes to Obtain Understanding

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that disturbances have occurred in the Isolated Battalion on Jiaozhou Road (膠州路) in recent days. A reporter asked the spokesman of the Shanghai Municipal Council what action the Council would take. The spokesman replied that the Council's responsibility for the Chinese troops inside the Jiaozhou Road barracks remains as before. This morning, the isolated troops in the barracks continued to actively express their demand for release and threw bricks out of the barracks to express their anger, but no one was injured by the bricks. According to a member of the Council, the Council attempted to seek an understanding with the isolated troops yesterday (the 16th), but due to the behavior of the Chinese soldiers, no results were achieved. There are no plans to resume discussions at this time. Once the isolated troops show signs of reconciliation, the Council will fulfill its responsibility to seek a harmonious understanding. At present, the disturbances in the Isolated Battalion have not yet subsided, and the White Russian company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps has sent more guards to be stationed around the barracks, blocking access.

Colonel Xie Jinyuan's Letter to the Press

Colonel Xie Jinyuan (謝晉元), the commander of the Isolated Battalion, sent a letter to the Shanghai press yesterday, explaining the details of the incident. The original text is as follows: To the colleagues of the Shanghai press, In recent days, the news about the Isolated Battalion in various newspapers has been mostly one-sided and aimed at suppressing the truth. The repair of the football field gate on the 13th was the fourth replacement within a month. Due to Mr. Ling's obstruction, the original gate was not moved. Whether a replacement is needed or not can be determined by on-site investigation. There was absolutely no conflict with the workers at that time, so how could there be any injury? On that day, at about 7:00 AM, because the replacement of the steel plate on the gate was obstructed, Major Mann asked to see me. While I was getting a haircut, Translator Wang reported that Major Mann had come to see me. I said that if it was an important matter, please consult with Major Xiong. Otherwise, see me in the afternoon or tomorrow. Unexpectedly, Major Mann left immediately and ordered the traffic to be cut off. A group of soldiers negotiated with the Volunteer Corps. Major Mann also rushed back. I got up before my haircut was finished and met with him. After a few words, everything returned to normal. This was the incident on the 13th. (All expenses are paid by the Chinese government.) On the morning of the 14th, at about 7:00 AM, Major Mann was again directing the Volunteer Corps to construct the fourth gate. This gate was between the second and fourth gates from the road into the barracks, and there was no reason for it. The officers and soldiers added to the obstruction. I asked Major Mann to come in and see me. We talked for about ten minutes. I said that there was absolutely nothing else and that I would do my best to maintain order. We have always cooperated with the Shanghai Municipal Council. Please do not provoke each other's feelings. Mr. Mann said that he had stopped construction and restored the original state. Unexpectedly, at this time, several education teachers and industrial instructors were [blocked] by the Volunteer Corps outside the road. Major Mann learned of this and immediately sent Translator Wang out to relay the message, that everything should be restored to its original state and that the visitors should not be hindered by Major Mann's orders. But when Translator Wang arrived in front of the gate and finished relaying the message, Colonel Hembell, the commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, led a team and arrived, without distinguishing between right and wrong, and without asking what Major Mann and I had talked about, and rashly ordered the traffic to be sealed off, and the visitors were not allowed in, which completely overturned the results of my conversation with Major Mann. Soon after, Translator Wang reported that Major Mann [gave] Colonel Hembell the order to add the fourth gate, and that Colonel Xie had to admit it, and after Colonel Hembell issued this order, he left, causing the situation to escalate. "The Shanghai Municipal Council has been sending representatives to the Isolated Battalion for negotiations in recent days" is not true. At 3:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 15th), Colonel Hembell visited the barracks with several people (reportedly newspaper reporters), but there were no representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Council, and only Colonel Hembell spoke, with the general meaning that the barracks gate should be restored to its original state, cleaned, the team should assemble, and Colonel Xie should go out and inspect it with him. Besides this, there was no other conversation. As a soldier, I can only make responsible remarks. I can also tell the world that there are no soldiers in China today who wish to leave their glorious motherland. It is a mistake to expect us to surrender. Wishing you peace, Xie Jinyuan, 29.9.17.

Rumors of Three Deaths Due to Injuries

Another report says that Colonel Xie of the Isolated Battalion told Western reporters yesterday that during the disturbances in the Isolated Battalion on Saturday (the 14th), dozens of isolated soldiers were injured as a result of the high-pressure tactics of the White Russian company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and the firefighters, and three soldiers died from their injuries. Colonel Xie solemnly stated that all the officers and soldiers of the Isolated Battalion would never willingly succumb to this kind of armed oppression. If the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities use force again, please do not listen to one-sided stories and conduct your own on-site investigation to clarify the truth.

### Reports of Four More Deaths of Wounded Soldiers in the Concentration Camp

Regarding the conflict between the Chinese soldiers and the French-Vietnamese soldiers in the Route Lareou (拉都路) concentration camp in the French Concession, the French-Vietnamese soldiers opened fire with machine guns, killing seven people on the spot and injuring more than twenty. The representative of the camp, Zhang Guangzhi (張廣志), was also arrested, and no results have been heard as of yesterday. However, it is only known that four of the injured soldiers died yesterday. French Concession officials have not issued any statements on this matter. However, additional French defense forces have been sent to strictly guard the perimeter of the concentration camp. According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, Chinese soldiers in the Route Lareou concentration camp in the French Concession clashed with the Vietnamese guards of the camp, and the enemy soldiers were brutally shot, killing eight people and injuring twenty-five. The number of soldiers guarding the camp has increased significantly this morning. French officials have remained silent about the tragic incident that occurred in the camp yesterday. However, it is believed that this matter is related to the disturbances in the Isolated Battalion. This morning, the camp has been placed under the control of the French Army's tenth regiment, and the situation is relatively calm. It is generally believed that the French authorities may begin consultations with the Chinese officers of the camp, aiming to reach an understanding.

### Shanghai Coastal Shipping Returns to Normal; Tai Sheng (泰生) Ship to Shantou (汕頭)

After the resumption of Shanghai coastal shipping on the 8th of this month, British Taikoo (太古) and Jardine (怡和) shipping companies have successively arranged ships to join the voyages. Taikoo's Suzhou ship and Jardine's Ming Sheng ship have departed from the port separately. However, due to limited cabin space, passengers are disappointed. Taikoo's Tai Yuan ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow afternoon, taking the route via Xiamen (廈門) and Hong Kong to Haiphong. Jardine's Tai Sheng ship has also been allowed to sail to Haiphong at 12:00 noon on the same day, stopping at Danang, Shantou, and Hong Kong. Jardine's Yong Niu (永牛) ship, which was briefly detained by the British military authorities, returned to Shanghai from Singapore the day before yesterday and is scheduled to join the Shanghai-Haiphong route tomorrow, stopping at Hong Kong. Taikoo's Heng Yang ship is scheduled to sail to Haiphong on the 22nd of this month. In addition, transportation between Hekou (河口) and Lao Cai (老街) can rely on ferry barges, and transportation is not obstructed. Therefore, passengers traveling to Haiphong in recent days are extremely crowded. Taikoo's Jia Ying ship is scheduled to sail to Siam on the morning of the 22nd, stopping at Saigon. It is reported that the French postal company's Xi Jiang (西江) ship will return to Shanghai from Saigon at the end of this month and will continue to operate between Shanghai and Saigon. Therefore, all cargo transportation and the arrival of tribute rice in Shanghai will not be affected.

### Cargo to Java Must Have Certification Starting October 1st

A reporter from the New News Agency learned from shipping circles that, regarding goods exported from this port to Java, the authorities in Java stipulate that, starting October 1st, a cargo certificate issued by the shipping company must be provided for import to be permitted. The Java Company, which operates the Southeast Asian route, has notified all cargo merchants separately that, if the goods they ship arrive in Java after October 1st, regardless of the type of goods, a detailed certificate must be filled out. The certificate must be obtained and filled out three days before the ship sails, and the required items to be filled out are: (1) marks, (2) numbers, (3) destination, (4) contents of the goods, (5) value, (6) gross weight, (7) net weight, (8) name of the loader, (9) exporting firm, (10) name of the ship and date, (11) name of the factory.

### British Youths Cherish Loyalty, Enlist for Their Country, Resigning Their Lucrative Positions, Saying Farewell to Relatives and Friends

The China Press reports that the British youths in Shanghai are deeply patriotic, and soon more people will leave their jobs to join the army. Recently, some have already left Shanghai, or are about to set off to join the army. The British expatriates who are not unemployed all have lucrative positions, and they resolutely bid farewell to their relatives and friends to serve the country. It is reported that at least twelve British employees of Jardine Matheson & Co. will leave Shanghai at the end of the month. Many employees of other British firms have also resigned, all with the aim of joining the army. There are also quite a few British people from the Shanghai Municipal Police Force who are joining the army. It is heard that many young British police officers are eager to enlist as soon as possible, so the old staff will soon be further reduced. Among the many British expatriates leaving soon, Paul, a messenger from the British Assessor's Office, is also among them. Paul has been in Shanghai for fifteen years, first working in the police force, and joining the British Assessor's Office three years ago. He has resigned on the 15th of this month.

### Unconditionally Reopen the Yunnan-Burma Road, Correct Selfish Behavior, Western Newspapers Urge Britain to Acknowledge

The Continental Daily News reports that the British Aid to China Committee, even at a time when Germany is fiercely carrying out air raids and is about to invade London, still remembers the affairs of the Far East, and submitted a letter to Prime Minister Churchill on the weekend, reporting the unanimous resolution of the whole country, demanding that the Yunnan-Burma Road be reopened immediately and unconditionally. This is truly a matter of great interest.

British Measures Disappoint China

According to a Reuters dispatch, this resolution has the support of nearly 300,000 British people. Regardless of the reason why the Yunnan-Burma Road has been blockaded for three months, the decision made by Britain to blockade the road is indefensible. Even Churchill himself admitted that Britain's actions contradict the resolution passed by the League of Nations in 1937, only because "we are now engaged in a life-and-death struggle," and therefore had to yield to the demands of the Japanese. This is truly a frank statement, but the fact remains that Britain has disappointed China.

Discussion Will Resume in March

The three-month period will expire in the middle of next month, at which time the Yunnan-Burma Road issue will be discussed again by Britain and Japan. During this period, what kind of changes will occur in Europe and the Far East cannot be predicted. Therefore, when the Yunnan-Burma Road issue is revisited in mid-October, Britain's attitude will depend on the progress of its war against Germany.

All Parties Hope for Fulfillment of Obligations

Judging from the current situation, it seems that Britain is quite capable of dealing with the fierce attacks of the Nazis. The war between Britain and Germany cannot be expected to be resolved within a month, but we hope that Britain, even in its "life-and-death struggle," will not forget its obligations and fulfill them.

Correct Past Mistakes in a Timely Manner

It should be noted that Britain's war against Germany and China's war of resistance in the past three years have different routes but the same destination, and their goals coincide. Sacrificing the lives of others to preserve oneself is a selfish act, which is not agreed upon by people with a sense of justice. Britain has already disappointed China, and the middle of next month is the time for it to correct its mistakes towards China. The British Aid to China Committee's letter to Prime Minister Churchill is indeed a timely piece of advice to the British government.

### Low-Priced Rice to Continue Tomorrow, Rice Prices Only Began to Fall Yesterday, The Sale of Surplus Rice at Low Prices Ends, Scalpers Overcharging and Bribing Sentenced Separately

In order to plan ahead, rice firms in this city have telegraphed overseas to order a large quantity of rice, amounting to about 60,000 bags. The rice business has now loaded ships and set sail for Shanghai, and will soon arrive in Shanghai to enter the market. The rice firms resumed market trading yesterday at their tea party. After opening at 7:30 yesterday morning, prices were immediately seen to fall, and morale was low. Large households supplied their current goods to the market, and were restless and uncertain. It is reported that the rice firms have heard that a large quantity of rice is on its way to Shanghai, and have no intention of continuing to buy. As a result, the market is flooded with spot goods, and the price of foreign rice has fallen by about 1.5 yuan compared to the previous market. It is also heard that merchants from various provinces believe that the price of rice in Shanghai is expensive, with a large difference compared to the price of production. Once transported to Shanghai, the profit is very high, so they have actively tried to purchase in large quantities and transport it to Shanghai to enter the market.

Sixth Phase of Low-Priced Sales to Start Tomorrow. Public Notice No. 6 of the Shanghai Low-Priced Rice Committee states, regarding public notice, it is hereby decided to continue the sixth phase of low-priced sales starting September 19th. In accordance with the above decision, 60 member rice firms within the two concessions are still entrusted by the Rice Firms Association to handle the low-priced sales, with 36 in the Public Concession, 18 selling tickets and 18 distributing rice, and 24 in the French Concession, with 12 selling tickets and 12 distributing rice. The Rice Firms Association has separately designated them to start on time. Those who purchase rice must purchase rice in accordance with the methods outlined below, and must not rush or push. In addition to reporting to the authorities of the two concessions to instruct the police stations to assist in sending police to suppress and protect, this is specially announced. The regulations for low-priced sales are as follows: (1) It is stipulated that each person is limited to buying rice for one yuan in Shanghai common currency, and must not buy more. (2) Each yuan sells four catties of rice. (3) Each store still sells only 50 bags of rice per day. (4) The selling time is from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. daily (new time), and will stop at any time after 50 bags are sold. (5) Those who purchase rice must purchase a rice ticket and then go to the rice distribution point designated on the rice ticket to collect the rice, and must not be confused.

Reporting to the Authorities to Handle the Closing. Shanghai Low-Priced Rice Committee's letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Concession's Board of Directors states, Dear Sirs, our association was established on January 5th of this year and has been in existence for more than eight months. We are grateful for the enthusiastic public spirit and generous donations from various trade associations and people from all walks of life, and for your council's deep sympathy and protection. The purpose of handling low-priced rice is to help the common people, which is a great duty of human mutual assistance. Considering the past, it has always been a temporary expedient, and there has never been a long-term undertaking that lasts for years and months. The members of our association have worked hard to bear the heavy responsibility, and we are deeply concerned. Our association handled three phases of low-priced sales in the first session, selling a total of 100,296 bags of tribute rice, with losses reaching more than 718,400 yuan. The second session has handled two phases of low-priced sales, selling about 20,000 bags, with losses reaching more than 157,000 yuan. The remaining 54,000 bags can barely be used for two months of low-priced sales. The members of our association have raised donations and borrowed rice capital. Today, we are exhausted and unable to continue. Therefore, after deliberation, we have decided to stop and close down after these remaining rice are sold out. We have no choice but to declare and announce to all sectors of society as soon as possible. We are especially writing to inform you and hope that your council will pay attention. We express our highest respect.

Rice Broker Overcharges and Bribes. Rice broker Sun Quan'guan, 26 years old, from Qingpu, residing at 154 Zhejiang Road, was peddling No. 2 Saigon rice at the rice market at around 10:30 a.m. on the 13th of this month, at a price of 65 yuan, which was 6 yuan higher than the price limit (59 yuan) set by the Grain Evaluation Committee. This was noticed by Mao Guoshi, No. 199 of the Chinese detectives stationed in the market by the police station, who arrested him. Sun tried to bribe Detective Mao with 40 yuan in legal tender, and the detective brought him to the police station together. On the 14th, the police station lawyer filed a lawsuit against him in court. For the part of destroying the price limit, the court yesterday (17th) sentenced him to 15 days of detention in accordance with Article 33, Section 1 of the Police Penalty Law. The sentencing for the bribery part is scheduled for the 24th of this month.

### United States Aviation Plan, Opening New Air Routes

From New York via South America to Africa According to news from the Shanghai Postal Administration, United States Aviation Company announced that "United States Aviation Company submitted an application to the Civil Aviation Department in Washington on August 15th" requesting permission to prepare for the establishment of a civil aviation route from New York to Portuguese Guinea on the west coast of Africa (5,000 miles long), which has been registered by the Civil Aviation Department. It is reported that the application stated that the applicant plans to extend the line to Cape Town in the Union of South Africa in the future. United States Aviation Company intends to order the line to pass through New Ande in the West Indies along the South African coast to Belem or Natal in Brazil, and then cross the South Atlantic to Bolama. The distance from New York to Bolama is 5,000 miles, and the section extending to South Africa is about 4,000 miles. In the future, Boeing 314A aircraft may be deployed to fly the line. The new aircraft is larger than the Clipper currently flying the Pacific route. However, according to a senior postal official of the Shanghai Postal Administration speaking to a reporter from the New News Agency, in the future, various air mails from Shanghai to New York and South America, or Africa, will be transported by the aircraft on this line, in order to be fast. He continued that the flight date of the line has not yet been determined. Once the line starts operating, the bureau will issue a notice stipulating the air mail charges.

### Japanese Consul General Miura Handles Transfer Matters

Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura Yoshiaki, has been ordered to be transferred to the post of Minister to Mexico. The Japanese Consulate General at 106 Huangpu Road has been busy in recent days handling the transfer matters.

### Four Banks Relieving the Market, Re-discounting and Re-mortgaging, Strictly Examining Loans for Daily Necessities, Lending Funds for Purchasing and Selling Operations at Fair Prices

In order to promote the circulation of funds in finance and various industrial and commercial sectors, the four banks of Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China have agreed to discount, re-discount, lend, and re-mortgage: (1) Discounting and re-discounting, commercial bills of exchange are discounted according to the face value, and government bonds, medium banknotes, or interest coupons are discounted according to the face value. (2) Loans and re-mortgages include major domestic and imported materials. It is heard that the four banks have specially set up a valuation committee to handle valuation matters, using 85% of the market price as the standard. The amount of re-mortgage loans shall not exceed the original mortgage amount.

Examination of Pledges

Since the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in accordance with the Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding Daily Necessities, designated 20 kinds of goods such as grain as daily necessities, the four banks of Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China strictly examine the mortgage loans and re-mortgages for the designated daily necessities, in order to avoid fueling speculation. It is heard that the Shanghai Banking and Monetary Industry Association has received an order from the Ministry to solemnly handle the mortgages of daily necessities. Those who request to mortgage goods shall be responsible for examining the purpose of the goods. If the mortgaged goods are daily necessities, the extension shall not be allowed after the expiration date. At the same time, the Shanghai branches of the four banks have also received the same order.

Fair Price Loans

The four banks have been ordered to provide loans for fair price purchasing and selling operations according to the actual demand in various places. If there are no fair price purchasing and selling offices in the local area, they may also handle it according to the local situation. However, the borrowers shall be subject to the inspection and supervision of the four banks. The daily necessities purchased and transported by the purchasing and selling offices, except for agricultural products, shall be limited to the original or relocated factory products, handicrafts, local products, and products of domestic goods manufacturers in Hong Kong and Shanghai. However, when necessary, they may purchase and transport foreign goods with approved foreign exchange, or submit an application for special permission to purchase daily necessities whose import is prohibited.

### Foreign Ships to Ao River All Detained, Rumor of Release of the Yichuan

Since the suspension of navigation between Ningbo and Wenzhou on the Shanghai-Zhejiang route, foreign ships have concentrated their sights on trying to navigate the Ao River. In the past two months, a total of more than 20 foreign ships have joined the trial voyage. Although some have succeeded in the trial voyage, most foreign ships have returned in vain due to the obstruction of Japanese warships along the way. Recently, because the British ship Jiangsu took the lead in successfully completing the trial voyage, the ships berthed in Shanghai have once again tried to navigate the river. However, it was learned yesterday that all ships sailing to Ao River were obstructed by Japanese warships.

Obstructed Midway

The Daxin was the first to be obstructed and detained on the sea off the coast of Wenzhou for many days. After repeated negotiations, it was released the day before yesterday and returned to Shanghai. The Anmanli and Jiangding were intercepted by Japanese warships along the way one after another, and are still being detained on the sea off Ligang. There is no news on whether the Maberilia and Shili have been detained. However, there is no telegram from the two ships that they have sailed into Ao River, and their itinerary is doubtful. As for the British merchant ship Jiangsu, which once arrived at Gutou in Ao River, it left Gutou last week and returned to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, when it sailed to the Ao River estuary, it was intercepted by a Japanese warship anchored at the estuary and forced to anchor. It is heard that the ship is now also being detained on the Jingjiang sea.

The German merchant ship Haiyi, managed by the Tongtaifeng Shipping Company, has been operating on the Songmen Qushan Xiushan route for more than a month, and it has been smooth. Unexpectedly, on the 13th, it started from Xiushan and returned to Shanghai. When it sailed to the Yushan sea, it was suddenly monitored by a Japanese warship, causing it to lose its freedom. When the Shanghai company heard the news, it repeatedly postponed the ship's schedule. On the one hand, it requested the German consulate to negotiate for release. It was learned yesterday that after the German consulate negotiated, the Japanese side agreed to release it. It may arrive in port today.

### No Oil to Skim, Resentment and Retaliation Between Ticketers and Ticket Inspectors of Route 17 Trolley, Another Serious Conflict Erupted Yesterday Morning

Since the Public Concession and French Concession tram companies implemented strict ticket inspections at the beginning of this month, the ticket sellers have had friction with the ticket inspectors due to the lack of oil to skim. At 11:30 p.m. on the 12th, a fight occurred because Wu Caichun, a ticket seller of No. 422 of the British Tram Company, refused to be inspected by Feng Yimin, a ticket inspector of No. 38 of the French Tram Company. Wu Caichun is still being detained in the Special No. 2 Court.

Another Conflict Erupts

As a result, the relationship between the ticket sellers of the Public Concession tram company and the ticket inspectors of the French Tram Company has deteriorated. At 7:05 a.m. yesterday morning, a No. 354 Route 17 trolleybus of the British Tram Company, which was traveling from Dapu Bridge to the intersection of Caishi Road and Lafayette Road, caused a conflict between the two parties because the ticket seller No. 788 of the bus refused to be inspected by the ticket inspector No. 17 of the French Tram Company. Then they started fighting, and the ticket seller No. 788 got off the bus and left, causing the bus to break down.

Serious Situation

When the Route 17 and 18 trolleybuses of the British Tram Company from the direction of the Great World heard the news, they also responded to each other and stopped, causing more than a dozen vehicles of the two tram companies on Route 17 and 18 to accumulate for a time, and the situation was quite serious. When the police station heard the news, it immediately sent police to protect and mediate, but it was not effective. It was not until 8:10 a.m. that the authorities of the British Tram Company learned of the situation and sent personnel to the scene to call back the vehicles to the factory. At the same time, they ordered the Route 17 and 18 trolleybuses to stop entering the French Concession to avoid expanding the situation.

Continued Traffic

The French Tram Company's chief of traffic, Maxina, also immediately ordered all Route 17 and 18 trolleybuses traveling on Kunming Road and the North Railway Station to enter the Public Concession. Therefore, yesterday, the Route 17 and 18 trolleybuses all traveled to the Great World as the terminus. However, until the evening, the vehicles on the two routes continued to travel between the two concessions.

The hearing continued yesterday morning, and the police station lawyer Yuan Jiahuang prosecuted the first to ninth defendants for robbery under Article 330 of the Criminal Law, and the tenth defendant Zeng Shangren for receiving stolen goods under Article 249 of the Criminal Law. First, detective Zhang Dongcheng reported the process, saying that the case occurred on July 17th, and the police station immediately notified the gold shops on the 20th to pay attention. Unexpectedly, Wang Binggen purchased three gold bars on the 17th, and his father purchased two more on the 23rd, which was obviously using the defendants to

Unknown Stolen Goods and Selling Them at Low Prices. Please Ask in Detail. As for the remaining defendants, some are principals, some help plan the robbery, and some receive stolen goods, all of which should be punished together. Wang Binggen confessed, I am the accountant of Lao Tianbao Gold Shop on Rue Robert, with a monthly salary of thirty-five. On the 17th, two people came first and took out a gold bar to cash it. At that time, I estimated the price to be four thousand six hundred and twenty yuan. Later, another person came and took out two bars, worth more than nine thousand yuan. On the 23rd, my father received two bars, but I didn't know they were stolen. Zhou A'gen confessed, this case was started by Zhang A'si and Peng De,

A total of five people, including me and Huan Qingfang, Sun Qingfu, and Zhang Guoliang, robbed a total of 28 gold bars, and I got one. Huan Qingfang confessed that Sun Qingfu entered Wang's house first, with one pistol for Sun, one for Zhang A'si, and one for me. Afterwards, the pistol was taken away by Zhang A'si. Expand Zhang A'si, robbed a total of 25 gold bars, and later I got one. Sun Qingfu confessed that I didn't know I was going to rob gold bars that day, I only knew I was called to help. Later, when I arrived at Wang's house, I only acted, and I got one gold bar. Later,

A fellow villager exchanged it for me and gave me two thousand yuan. Xu Yishan confessed, I didn't go that day, because Zhang Guoliang wanted to establish a special agent team in Zhabei and lacked guns, so I lent him my pistol. Later, I also got a gold bar. Zhang Guoliang confessed that he went to Wang Zhiren's house to rob. Zhang A'si took the lead, followed by Sun Qingfu, Zhou A'gen, Huan Qingfang, and me. After the gold bars were obtained, I got one. Lu Zhaochang confessed that I was a Chinese detective No. 619 in the Public Concession, because my pistol was robbed when I was on duty in Caojiadu, which led to the police station

Suspended me for six months, which has now expired. I was planning to resume my post, but unexpectedly this happened and implicated me, causing me to be unable to resume my post. In fact, I don't know anything about this matter. Yu Xiaobo confessed that I am a translator in the Fifth Section of the Political Department of the Public Concession Police Station, and I am a relative of the plaintiff Wang Zhiren. Although I also live next to Wang in Zhi Maoli, I have never seen Wang have gold bars, so I don't know anything about this matter. Wang Zhifang confessed that I didn't go that day, and I don't know Zhang A'si. I don't know anything about this matter at all. Zeng Shangren confessed that he

Is a Cotton Textile Broker, The Two Gold Bars Searched From My Home Are Not Mine, They Were Sent To My House By My Fellow Villager Gao Jinshun. I Know Gao, Because Gao Wants To Open A Gambling Table And Entrusted Me To Get A License For Him. Therefore, I Ask The Court To Acquit Me. The Defendants Also Entrusted Lawyers Wu Chu Liang, Wang Shizong, Huang Zeng Jie, and others to defend. Judge Li Weishen reviewed the words, because the case is complicated and requires detailed investigation. He instructed that the date be changed to 9:00 a.m. on the 26th of this month for further interrogation, and the defendants were sent back into custody. The request for bail was denied.

### Jointly Selling Rice, Embezzling Dividends, Yu Jianzhang Accused

Yu Jianzhang, who lives at No. 6, 1366 Lafayette Road, whose father, Yu Songzhou, is a famous pediatrician of traditional Chinese medicine, lives at No. 15 Hengle Lane, Bubbling Well Road. Yu Jianzhang engaged in the rice sales business after the war, and his accumulated assets have reached hundreds of thousands. He separated from his father and has a private car at No. 1395. Recently, Ge Boxin (36 years old, residing at No. 431 Fuzhou Road), a Shanghainese who partnered with Yu, entrusted lawyer Huang Jiyuan to represent him and filed a private prosecution in the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing him of embezzling rice and profits, and requesting legal investigation. It is stated that on March 26th of this year, Yu Jianzhang, the defendant, introduced by Sheng Cuizhi, said that the price of white japonica rice in Wuxi and Qishuyan and other places was very different from the price per stone in this city. He had set 1,273 stones of high-quality white japonica rice there, with an average price of 31 yuan and 40 cents per stone, and had already obtained a transportation permit, which could be transported to Shanghai for sale within two weeks at the latest. The net profit per stone could be 6 or 7 yuan. Because the deadline for ordering was approaching and the funds were difficult to raise, if he was willing to advance 40,000 yuan to cooperate, in addition to paying interest, he was willing to distribute all the profits equally. The plaintiff agreed to his request and paid the defendant 40,000 yuan the next day. After that, he did not see him again. After stern negotiations, the defendant said that the transportation permit had been obstructed. It was delayed until June, when the plaintiff tried to entrust the Xie Da Rice Firm to transport and sell the rice. The defendant delivered 1,125 stones, and after selling it, after deducting expenses and interest, there was a profit of 1,000 yuan, which was taken away by the defendant. He embezzled the 500 yuan that should have been handed over. The remaining 148 stones of white japonica rice should have been divided equally after the profit was sold, but he also delayed handing them over with excuses. After investigation, it was learned that the defendant had already embezzled them. In desperation, he filed a lawsuit for investigation in accordance with the law, and attached a civil lawsuit to recover 1,000 yuan of profit and half of the 148 stones of white japonica rice, etc. The court accepted the case and opened a court hearing yesterday with Judge Jiang to summon the defendant. The defendant was not present, and only the plaintiff and the lawyer were present. The court slightly questioned the plaintiff and announced that the defendant would be summoned to the court again on the 26th of this month for verification. It is heard that the defendant was also accused in the First Special District Court of selling and embezzling bag skins in the British Concession.

Under the dedicated promotion of Chairman Zhang Shouyong, Supervisor Wu Yunzhai, Vice-Chairman Yu Zuoting, Vice-Supervisor Xu Jiyin, Chairman of the Committee Dai Chunfeng, and Director Zhang Guoquan, the relief and education efforts have expanded from elementary schools in five districts to primary and secondary schools in 42 districts due to environmental needs. A total of over 2,500 students are being assisted. In addition to the complete waiver of tuition and miscellaneous fees, all educational supplies such as books, textbooks, and notebooks are provided free of charge by the center.

However, both labor and management refused to accept the invitation. The management immediately reported the matter to the relevant police station. The police sent officers to investigate to prevent incitement of a labor strike. Furthermore, according to labor representatives, reports that labor petitioned western Shanghai were baseless. Currently, labor is still working quietly and is determined not to be exploited. Management is also actively considering labor's demands. Both sides are sincere and a satisfactory resolution should be easy.

### Hunan Province Promotes the "Teach Three" Movement

(Laiyang Correspondence) There is still a large number of illiterate people in Hunan Province.

### Fujian Elementary Schools Must Not Charge Any Fees for Issuing Graduation Certificates

(Minhou Correspondence) In the past, a small number of schools in Minhou County have often charged fees for issuing graduation certificates, which is inappropriate. This time, the Minhou County government has successively printed and distributed graduation certificates for the second semester of the 28th year (i.e., graduates in July of the 29th year), and each certificate has been stamped with "Not Permitted to Charge Any Fees" to prevent malfeasance. Furthermore, in the past, the prices at which various elementary schools resold exercise books to students were all above five cents. After the county government sent personnel to investigate various bookstores and paper shops, the highest printing price was found to be below four cents (the lowest price was only two cents and eight li per book), and the prices were not printed, which easily led to malfeasance. It was deemed necessary to correct this situation. The county government has distributed the format to various bookstores and paper shops, allowing them to reprint and sell the books, and has stipulated that the selling price shall be uniformly set at three cents and two li, and printed on the cover, so that students can recognize the price and prevent profiteering.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Shows Near-Term Inflow and Long-Term Outflow

In yesterday's foreign exchange market, the HSBC listed rates showed no movement. The gray market for British and American currencies was mediocre. Although there were many transactions, there was no significant response between buying and selling. This was because operators had both inflows and outflows. The weakness of the pound was due to the Bank of England's renewed buying interest, which required better prices, seemingly due to improved war news for Britain in Europe. By the close of the evening, sellers had decreased slightly, so the US exchange also tightened to 5.3125. A British gold three pence five seven eight one two five, calculated to reduce zero three one two five, it is heard that foreign banks arbitrage near and far slightly, and forward transactions are not weak.

Favorable Pound Absorption

At the beginning of the morning, due to large London transactions, the near term fell zero six two five, while the far term rose zero six two five. The New York silver price remained flat, and London gold remained fixed. Exchange rates were flat against the US and Shanghai, etc. The US rate against the British rate rose slightly by two five, against Shanghai was unchanged, and there was no market against France. The central bank's listed rates remained unchanged. Banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning: British gold three pence six zero nine three seven five, US exchange five yuan three one two five, the British and US exchange rates were both flat compared to the close of last Saturday. After opening, Chinese banks showed a slight appetite, and foreign banks were quite willing to supply, so the market was still flat. It is estimated that foreign banks sold this month's US exchange at five yuan three one two five. Later, US banks and speculators also bought this month's US exchange at five yuan three one two five, and October's at five yuan two eight one two five. The HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax was revealed to be reduced by zero point five percent. Thereafter, the pound price became slightly tighter due to the favorable absorption of pounds by the Bank of England, with the price for this month being three pence five nine three seven five, down to five seven eight one two five. At the same time, US banks sold this month's US exchange slightly weaker at five yuan two eight one two five. Chinese banks' silk industry was still buying October's US exchange in Shanghai for five yuan six one two five. The noon close finally announced that the US was flat and the British pound tightened zero three one two five, to five yuan three one two five and three pence five seven eight one two five.

Slight Swap Transactions

The market conditions in the afternoon remained flat and warm. Initially, Chinese banks' silk industry swapped out September's US balance at five yuan three one two five, which was absorbed by a certain Western broker. Advantageous entry speculators also quoted five yuan three one two five. Foreign banks once made deals for this month's pound at three pence five seven eight one two five and October's US exchange at five yuan two eight one two five. The evening close resulted in British gold at three pence five seven eight one two five, US exchange at five yuan two eight one two five, and next month's British gold at three pence five six two five, US exchange at five yuan two five. Compared to last weekend's close, the British and US exchange rates were each weaker by zero three one two five in both spot and forward.

Hong Kong, 17th (Monday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The US exchange rate fluctuated. The British exchange rate had no gains or losses in both spot and forward. The US spot exchange rate tightened zero six two five to twenty-two yuan one eight seven five (yesterday's opening was twenty-two yuan two five). The Shanghai exchange rate rose by three yuan, to four hundred seventeen yuan (yesterday's opening was four hundred fourteen yuan, but there were transactions without a market).

The "United Notes" gray market also depreciated by two jiao five fen to ninety-one yuan five jiao.

### Gray Market Price Increased

The gray market outside the exchange was flat and warm, with prices in the range of six thousand one hundred fifty to sixty yuan. Suddenly, news of a certain favorable development spread, and the exchange market reported a slight tightening. Buyers gathered, and the price soon rose to six thousand two hundred yuan, but few transactions were heard. Later, the foreign exchange market rebounded slightly, and the noon price fell back to only six thousand one hundred eighty yuan, but there were still buyers, about thirty to forty yuan higher than on Saturday.

### Deposit Increase: Exchange Rate Reduced

Recently, due to the abundance of floating capital in the city, deposits in various banks have increased sharply. The market is stable. The Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Preparatory Committee has reduced the exchange rate. The interest rate has been changed since yesterday (the 17th) as follows: The public single discount interest rate is 2.8 fen in national currency, the exchange rate is 1.8 fen, the acceptance bill 90-day discount rate is 2.8 fen in national currency, the exchange rate is 1.8 fen, the interest on intra-industry exchange is 1.5 fen, the deposit interest is 1 fen, and the interest on intra-industry loans is 1.8 fen (all calculated per thousand yuan per day). Compared to August 8, the national currency interest rate has not changed, and the exchange rate has been reduced by a certain amount. Compared to May 1, the exchange rate has been reduced by 1.5 jiao per thousand yuan per day. The interest on intra-industry exchange was three jiao on May 1 and is now 1.5 jiao, with the difference being exactly half.

The demand for Korean notes was also strong, rising again to 1.13 yuan in the evening.

### Zhongnong New Two-Jiao Note: - Two More Hidden Marks -

After the commercial column of the newspaper published the hidden marks of the Zhongnong two-jiao note by Mr. Ji Meng on the 5th, it has been found that there are still a few points that seem to have been missed. They are now supplemented as follows:

Both hidden marks are on the front. That is, in the upper right corner, on the left treetop of the two trees, there is a cursive English letter "W", mixed with the leaves. Its position is on the lower left of the character "大". Between the English "T" and "LE", near the edge of the "Two Jiao" border, there is a square gap with something like the Chinese character "入" in the middle. Its position is in the left bush of leaves on the left of the two trees on the left, next to the "貳角" border. Others, such as the bridge by the weeds under the left tree, are mixed with the letter "E", but it is blurred and unclear, so I don't know. (Shan)

### Securities: Bond Market Mediocre

The securities gray market opened as usual yesterday. However, because today is still a holiday, yesterday's price only had half a day of trading. The market was therefore sideways, and transactions were quite rare. Most banks did not enter the market but waited and watched. Market prices were only different by one or two jiao. There were no type A transactions. The general conclusion was that Lianhe Renchang Jiufeng were buying, and Lianyi Hongda Hengfu were selling. Market prices ultimately differed by only one or two jiao. The trading volume was about 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below. Today is a holiday.

Stock trading: 100 shares of Xinxin Company were traded at a price of 10.075 yuan.

The Public Industry Association reported that the stock market opened with extraordinary enthusiasm due to good news received over the weekend. However, the wind of profit-taking soon became rampant, and the upward momentum was frustrated again. There was quite a lot of support when prices fell. The evening closing price was still much higher than the final price on Friday. Industrial stocks were traded in extremely large quantities, and rubber stocks were neglected.

London, 16th (Tuesday) dispatch: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and British merchant stocks in the distant area were generally calm. Only the Maccelli Bank shares fell by two shillings six pence due to the dividend relationship, and the price was six pounds seven shillings six pence. The rest were unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: Market Still Stagnant

Yesterday's yarn and cotton situation remained stagnant, with basically no transactions. Overseas Indian-American cotton prices revolved, up and down, around two or three pounds, with no gains or losses to be distinguished. It was also found that 1,075 pieces of cotton yarn and 250 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong today.

According to another report, the market price of foreign cotton in New York opened higher in the morning due to purchases by speculators. Later, due to the sharp rise in stock prices on Wall Street and the general public's purchases, the closing price was four or five pounds higher than the previous day. India has also been mediocre recently. Yesterday, including forecasts, it fell by half a rupee.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been lackluster recently. All parties have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Factories are purchasing weakly, and there is talk of Japanese factories reducing working hours, but the details are difficult to ascertain. Chinese factories also have relatively abundant reserves and are unlikely to reduce working hours for the time being.

### Profiteering by Hoarding Cotton Leads to Speculative Losses

Since the August 13th Incident [the Battle of Shanghai, 1937], the cotton businesses in Shanghai have flourished. Companies with capital of several thousand yuan have seen profits eventually reach hundreds of thousands of yuan. Those with substantial strength have even earned one to two million yuan. Consequently, capitalists concentrated in the "isolated island" [Japanese-occupied Shanghai] have, observing the above situation, pooled their resources and formed companies like mushrooms after a spring rain. During the speculative frenzy this spring, those with nervous temperaments discussed at length that hoarding cotton would be the safest bet. Therefore, the industry united and collectively purchased substantial quantities of American and Indian cotton. At that time, overseas cotton prices were at their peak. Speculators only cared about the current enthusiastic atmosphere and ignored global affairs. They bought and bought, ordering more and more. Some had not settled their foreign exchange transactions and settled at the highest price, resulting in the highest costs, with the cost of 20-count raw cotton exceeding 100 yuan per day. Unexpectedly, good times did not last. The European war escalated, with Germany's blitzkrieg advancing into France. Global commodity prices plummeted instantly. American cotton frequently declined, falling from 1.10 yuan to just a few cents. Indian cotton fell from 270-280 rupees to 150-160 rupees, a drop of more than 40 percent. At the same time, after 5.2, the foreign exchange prospects were bright, gradually improving and strengthening, making overseas cotton prices increasingly cheaper when calculated. However, cotton merchants held onto their goods, all overstocked. Those who once smiled broadly now frown with worry. This is not surprising for seasoned professionals, but it has caused suffering for a group of speculative followers. As the saying goes, "Extreme prosperity leads to decline." The price of yarn has plummeted, and manufacturers are also busy purchasing foreign cotton, already struggling to manage themselves. Credit is tight, and there is no demand for spot cotton. Meanwhile, orders continue to arrive on schedule. Initially, merchants thought that the intense European war would cause severe obstacles to Far East shipping and lead to blockades and shortages. However, the opposite happened. Orders arrived in Shanghai on schedule, and the value of the legal tender became more stable. Those holding goods had to sell them in the market, but buyers were hard to find, showing a clear sign of weak confidence. However, this rapid change was unexpected, with the biggest factor being political instability. To this day, the cotton market remains in a bad state and is difficult to recover. This time, the US dollar exchange rate has shrunk from 5.80 yuan to 5.09375 yuan. Based on this observation, raw cotton should be viewed favorably, but it remains lifeless. In fact, its disease is severe, with excessive greed, making it difficult to receive divine assistance. The import situation for this year is recorded on the left (unit: bales) (each bale weighs 400 pounds): Indian cotton 517,168, African cotton 22,918, American cotton 412,233, Burmese cotton 8,600, Brazilian cotton 244,956, totaling 1,229,742, Egyptian cotton 13,868.

The above is the quantity of foreign cotton imported from August of last year to August of this year. Among them, Indian cotton is the largest at 517,168 bales. Each bale weighs 800 pounds. Next is American cotton at 412,232 bales, and Brazilian cotton at 244,956 bales. With this large amount of cotton imported, the market is overwhelmed. As soon as the market price rises slightly, those holding goods seek to sell due to credit constraints, making it impossible for prices to rise. Moreover, the inventory is large, and once the goods arrive, they are dead in the water. Therefore, the spot price of cotton in Shanghai is actually tens of yuan cheaper than the overseas price. However, factories still do not come to buy this cheap goods, mainly because factories have hoarded cotton, with the exception of Japanese factories which have less in need. As for foreign factories, due to the abundant production of new cotton in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year, prices are extremely low. The price of Tongzhou seed cotton is 30 yuan per "zu" [unit]. The price of seed cotton near Shanghai is also cheap, at 38 to 40 yuan per "dan" [unit]. However, it is forbidden to transport it out of the region. Therefore, based on the current situation, the cotton in the hands of general hoarders is still difficult to release for the time being. Currently, the inventory of long-staple cotton is decreasing, while other cotton still lacks sales channels. Now that the new cotton has entered the market, it is even more difficult for old cotton to rise in price. This is also the speculators reaping what they sowed. The British-owned Sino-British Cotton Mill Co., Ltd., decided at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on August 31 to increase its capital to 10 million national currency, divided into 2 million shares, each with a par value of 5 yuan. In addition to the 800,500 shares already issued, with a paid-up capital of 4,002,500 yuan, it is now scheduled to publicly solicit 410,000 new shares on September 19, totaling 2 million yuan, with each share sold at a premium of 10 percent, for a selling price of 5.50 yuan.

### ### Review of Summer Sales of Piece Goods and Woolens

— Jiang Changfeng

The Mid-Autumn Festival has passed, and as we look back at the quiet woolen market, we can't help but recall the rapid changes in woolen sales since the Dragon Boat Festival.

In the period before the Dragon Boat Festival, the black market exchange rate in the isolated island was fluctuating constantly. Everything in the market took the opportunity to raise prices. Woolens, as one of the imported goods, was even more deeply stimulated by the foreign exchange rate than other industries. Therefore, all the woolen wholesale, distribution, and retail shops suddenly announced price increases of 20-30% or even 40-50%. A small number of transactions were considered "favors." If it was a large bulk purchase, they would be met with cold words and polite refusals.

Because it was the summer season, items like summer suiting, worsted, feather yarn, and linen were the most popular in woolens. However, the arrival of goods was limited. Most of the old stock had been snapped up by some far-sighted tailors or brokers in the early spring. Therefore, the entire woolen summer sales market showed a situation where demand far exceeded supply. Most tailors, seeing that the market price was only getting tighter day by day, agreed to customize summer clothes first. This, on the one hand, created a more serious shortage of summer materials, and on the other hand, stimulated the prices of some remaining old stock to rise rapidly. For example, worsted, which previously cost only 7.10 yuan per yard, rose to about 23 yuan at once, and then went straight to 30 yuan. Feather yarn, which used to sell for tens of yuan per yard in previous years, suddenly reached a peak of 45 yuan. Other items like linen were even more surprisingly inflated. For example, a white double-width linen (Friendship brand), which cost less than 10 yuan a yard last year, now costs about 40 yuan. A set of linen suits costs about 200 yuan, which is equivalent to a set of the best pullover tweed from previous years. A careful comparison is indeed astonishing.

Woolen summer sales proceeded in such a stormy and turbulent manner. One point is worth mentioning, and that is that it promoted the rise of many domestic woolens. Summer suiting and feather yarn, etc., all had unexpected sales. As for the Sanjiang linen item, it was the common material worn by Western-style dressers in the past summers. The best, such as the French-made AAA brand, sold for only about 3 yuan a yard. However, this year it rose to 15 yuan, and the customers were shocked. Hongsheng (a Chinese merchant) Sanjiang linen then became very popular, with a price of about 4 yuan. Although this was also an increase of 50-60% compared to previous years, compared to other brands, some tailors thought it could still be sold and purchased it in groups. This must be said to be a good phenomenon!

However, I must say that the shortage of foreign woolens, on the other hand, stimulated the minds of some friends who specialize in hoarding and speculation. Seeing the summer sales like this, they made large-scale searches for autumn and winter materials. It is said that many of them have formed groups, like companies, sharing equity, and then hoarding whatever goods they can get, regardless of what they are produced or what type, trying to make a fortune in the coming season.

The facts were a wake-up call. In recent times, general prices have been rebounding sharply - sales have been sluggish, and prices are falling back. The woolens, because of previously ordered goods, have also been continuously shipped from places like Singapore, and all low-grade, common goods have also initially shown signs of falling prices. Many woolen hoarders who were "strong in capital" and "active in the market" are now facing their greatest depression. In order to sell, the price of goods has to be lowered step by step, but because of the sluggish sales, the road to sales is not prosperous. People who once clamored for profits of millions or tens of millions are now in a state of frustration and depression.

How will the autumn and winter sales be? What is the future of the price of goods? Most woolen merchants are hovering in such questions. The summer sales season did give them stimulation to the point of madness, but the depression at this time is also the most uncomfortable.

### Grain: Price of Foreign Rice Gradually Approaching Shanghai Market

After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the rice market resumed business as usual at 9 a.m. yesterday. According to telegrams from Hong Kong, the black market price of foreign rice is gradually approaching the Shanghai price. Actual sales of foreign rice are exceptionally sluggish, while new "Kehsien" [Indica rice], new "Yangjian" [foreign-style rice], and new "Keng" [Japonica rice] are arriving in Shanghai in a steady stream. More than 2,000 bags of "Wuhsien" [Wuhu-style Indica rice] continue to arrive. Therefore, the rice market, which the sellers intended to develop after the festival, lacks actual sales and demand. The total transaction volume for the day was less than 5,000 bags, and half of them were still floating and collected. Therefore, people in the market are mostly nervous. After opening in the morning, the price fluctuated for a while, and then continued to decline step by step due to oversupply. The opening prices were: No. 1 Saigon old goods 69 yuan, new goods 67.40 yuan, "Huojiao" [high-quality rice] 67 yuan to 65 yuan, No. 2 Saigon 63.50 yuan to 62.50 yuan, No. 2 Siam 62.50 yuan to 62 yuan, "Xiaojiao" [low-quality rice] 62 yuan to 61.80 yuan, Haiphong special red tip 61 yuan, medium 58 yuan, "Milu" [coarse rice] 53.50 yuan to 53 yuan, slightly lower than the pre-festival price by 1-2 yuan.

Yesterday, a small amount of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai, carried by the Taikoo Company's "Taiyuan" ship, carrying 674 bags from Hong Kong, which arrived at the port yesterday morning and berthed at the company's wharf in the French Concession for unloading.

Glutinous rice is still not available, and the sales are average. The prices quoted are unchanged. The opening price for Jinli special "Yuan" [round-grain glutinous rice] is 71-72 yuan, ordinary 68 yuan, Changdan white "Yuan" around 70 yuan. The sales of guest glutinous rice are more slack, and the market is weakened by about 1 yuan. Hong Kong special "Yun" is 70 yuan, ordinary 68 yuan.

The source of thick, thin, and broken "Keng" [Japonica rice] and other domestic rice continues to be blocked, but as foreign rice gradually falls, the black market is slightly weaker by a few cents. The opening prices are: Changbang special "Keng" 80 yuan, ordinary 77-78 yuan, Wuchang Su-Kun "Keng" high 78.50 yuan, second to 75-76 yuan, Kunshan fragrant "Keng" 76 yuan to 74.50 yuan, Qingpu thin broken 76 yuan, Nangang original package early broken unopened, the bulk price is 73.50 yuan to 73 yuan.

New "Kengjian" from various sources, in the past two days, about 2,000-3,000 "shi" [unit of volume] were pedaled into Shanghai by bicycles, so the selling price is nearly 1 yuan shorter than before the festival. The opening prices are: new "Keng" 72.50 yuan to 71.80 yuan, Taicang Jiading "Yangjian" original package 66 yuan, the bulk price is 64 yuan, Du "Jian" the bulk price is 65 yuan to 64.50 yuan.

### Oil Cakes: Violent Surge in the Oil Market

Yesterday, the soybean oil market was monopolized by speculation. The price of each product surged sharply, causing speculators in the market to be active and people to tend towards bullishness. The market price continued to rise sharply, resulting in a jump of 3-4 yuan compared to before the holiday. The prices were: Jiaozhou soybean oil 250 pieces, priced at 74-75 yuan, Qingdao soybean oil 100 barrels, priced at 102 yuan, Dayouyu factory soybean oil more than 500 "dan" [unit of weight], priced at 79.50 yuan for old bills, and 80.05 yuan to 81.50 yuan for new bills. The transaction for peanut oil was 200 barrels of Qingdao oil, priced at 94-95 yuan. The selling price for delivery in October was also the same as the opening price above. In addition, the price of 250 pieces of Jiaozhou spot oil was 67-68.50 yuan. 300 pieces for delivery in late September were priced at 67.50-68.50 yuan. 450 pieces for delivery in early October were priced at 67.50-69.50 yuan. 800 pieces for delivery in late October opened at 68 yuan and rose to close at 70.05 yuan. Today the market is closed for one day, and will resume business as usual on the morning of the 19th.

### Sugar Market: Refined White Sugar Slightly Tight

Yesterday, the sugar market quoted prices for spot goods. The new goods of No. 24 group white sugar from foreign warehouses were quoted at 78.50 yuan. The goods arriving in July were 78 yuan. Transshipment goods were quoted at 63 yuan. Dutch cotton white TML mark was 74 yuan, KD mark was 73 yuan, slightly looser than before.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Tianjin Red Dates Rise by Nine Yuan

Recently, some Tianjin red dates have been transported in. Yesterday, it was heard that more than 80 packages were opened, with Date King at 82 yuan, Date Head at 72 yuan, First Grade at 62 yuan, and Second Grade at 22 yuan, an increase of nine yuan compared to before.

One hundred packages of raw kernels arrived from Yantai yesterday.

### Lanchu Branches Will Continue to Arrive

New Lanchu branches have been seen, but only dozens of boxes have arrived initially. Moreover, the transportation between Zhangzhou and Gulangyu has been suspended again, resulting in a lack of continued arrivals. According to news from the companies, transportation there has resumed, and it is expected that shipments will continue to arrive within days.

### Seafood: Fragrant Mushrooms Are Popular and Profitable

The sales of fragrant mushrooms have recently become active. Due to the lack of arrivals and limited stock in the market, the situation is very popular and profitable. Currently, ordinary goods from Pingzhuang must be sold for 520 yuan, and high-grade goods for about 600 yuan. However, the price of winter mushrooms is still stable, with a price of 650 yuan to 750 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: Needle, Show, and Mei Teas Are Sold

Yesterday, the green tea market in foreign firms saw sales of the colorless Fengmei pearl tea from American firms. Jardine Matheson and Jinlong and other foreign firms have not received any response to the telegrams sent last week, and are still waiting for news. However, items such as Needle, Show, and Mei Teas have some sales to Nanyang, Tianjin, and other groups. Yesterday's market made more than 170 packages. Needle and Mei teas opened at 50-58 yuan, and Show teas opened at 40 yuan, both prices were 15-16 yuan lower than before.

### Coal - Indian Coal Street Sales Surge

Indian briquette coal has recently seen slightly improved sales due to the arrival of autumn. Businesses have actively begun procuring it. However, due to high costs, sellers are unwilling to lower prices easily, leading to a favorable market situation. Yesterday, the wholesale price of Indian lump coal was 192 yuan per ton, and mixed coal was 185 yuan per ton, both prices ex-warehouse. Additional fees apply.

Current Affairs

### Advocating Group Rice Purchasing

--Dan Feng Chong

"Group rice purchasing" was not originally a movement caused by the current rice hoarding and manipulation that has led to rice prices exceeding the limit, but began more than half a year ago. However, according to a newspaper report the other day, it is necessary to "advocate" "group rice purchasing" again, which shows that on the one hand, the situation of rice hoarding and manipulation is serious, and on the other hand, it can also be seen that "group rice purchasing" has not left a deep impression in the minds of the general public.

Since we are going to "advocate" "group rice purchasing" again today, we must find out why the last "group rice purchasing" did not leave a deep impression in the minds of the general public. We cannot deny that the last "group rice purchasing" had some shortcomings. The most important reason is that "group rice purchasing" has not penetrated into the general public, but only in some production departments. Today's "group rice purchasing", according to reports, is led by companies and factories such as China National Products Company, Wang Shengji Woodware Store, and China Enamel Factory. This is limited to a production department. In my opinion, today's "group rice purchasing" must be universal to all citizens of Shanghai. If it is really advocated in this way, then it is not impossible to eliminate hoarding and manipulation.

"Group rice purchasing" was not originally a movement caused by the current rice hoarding and manipulation that has led to rice prices exceeding the limit, but began more than half a year ago. However, according to a newspaper report the other day, it is necessary to "advocate" "group rice purchasing" again, which shows that on the one hand, the situation of rice hoarding and manipulation is serious.

Our first step must be to expand the importance of "group rice purchasing" so that the slogan becomes as deeply ingrained in the minds of the public as the "safety movement" in Shanghai in the past. The next step is to strengthen "neighborhood organizations". Each neighborhood has an organization to eliminate hoarding and manipulation, so that "group rice purchasing" can be implemented from each neighborhood. In this way, the momentum will be great. If we only rely on companies and factories, then we must remember that we will definitely lose many vendors, freelancers, and even those who rely on other kinds of income (such as unemployed landlords) or the unemployed. Therefore, in my opinion, the role of "neighborhood organizations" in "group rice purchasing" is very important. Of course, the role of "neighborhood organizations" is not only to deal with "rice", but also other daily necessities have their important role, and even "cooperatives" can be organized according to each neighborhood or by linking several neighborhoods.

Not long ago, in order to curb "speculation" and "manipulation", our government issued decrees to ban these unscrupulous acts, and at the same time used a huge sum of 30 million yuan to purchase bulk daily necessities and sell them at par. As a result, other commodity prices immediately fell by 20-30% across the board. Of course, we very much hope that the Shanghai authorities can raise a large sum of money to do this. However, even if it is not raised, if every neighborhood is organized, I think, no matter how much money they have (because each neighborhood contributes a certain amount of money in advance, it is also considerable), even in terms of its great momentum, I think it can also scare off speculators and manipulators.

Perhaps some people think that my opinion is close to ideal and cannot be implemented. However, all ideals are valued by practice. Then, this ideal cannot be realized from the beginning! It concerns the daily life of the vast majority of citizens of Shanghai. I hope everyone will pay attention to this issue!

Hawthorne Detective Case

### The Destiny of the Dance Queen

--By Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 7: "Take Him Away!"

Hawthorne glanced at him and said, "You played mahjong at the Yangtze Hotel until dawn, didn't you? What room number?"

Lu Jiansheng said embarrassedly again; "This—fourth floor, room 412."

"Who were the three people in the game?"

"This—one surnamed Huang, one surnamed Li, and one—"

"Surnamed Zhang. Isn't it?"

"No, no, also surnamed Lu."

Hawthorne suddenly put down one leg he had been resting on, stretched out his arms, stretched his waist, and then stood up. With a somber face, he said, "Alright, we have important things to do, and we don't have time to listen to your nonsense. … Detective Ni, I don't think you can help but inconvenience this Manager Lu a bit. Before the investigation of this case is completed, it is not convenient to let him move freely."

Ni Jinshou opened his eyes in surprise, "Mr. Hawthorne, what—what does this mean?"

Hawthorne said concisely, "Don't you understand? Take him away!"

"This sentence had the effect of a thunderbolt on the banker. He also suddenly jumped up from the sofa. His lips trembled as he defended himself.

He stammered, "What?—Take me away?—Take me away?"

Hawthorne said, "Yes, take you away! Is it impossible to take away a bank manager?"

"This has nothing to do with being a manager or not. You—you can't just take people away. I have a lawyer."

Hawthorne sneered, "It's even better if you have a lawyer. There's a telephone here. You can call your lawyer right away."

Lu Jiansheng didn't want to make a phone call. He only glanced at the telephone and continued to speak to Hawthorne, "You—what reason do you have to take me away?"

Hawthorne glanced at him and replied, "Of course there is a reason. I didn't want to say it originally, but for the convenience of Detective Ni performing his duties, I might as well tell you. First, your whereabouts were unknown last night. You are indeed a regular customer at the Yangtze Hotel, room 412. There was indeed a mahjong game last night, but you did not join the game and you did not go to the hotel." (110)

### It's Hard to Study

--Ke Ming

In this kind of year, it is really difficult to read a little, not to mention anything else, just a few books will cost more than ten yuan, not to mention many miscellaneous expenses and various educational supplies.

Just look at the fee bills of general schools:

Tuition: 35 yuan

Book fee: 3 yuan

Servant fee: 2 yuan

Physics and chemistry experiment fee: 5 yuan

Sports fee: 1 yuan

Compensation reserve: 5 yuan

Lecture fee: 4 yuan

Health equipment fee: 3 yuan

Medical fee: 2 yuan

Miscellaneous fees: 4 yuan

Deposit: 10 yuan

Compensation reserve: 5 yuan

Some schools not only have legitimate ways to collect money, but also stipulate that "the deposit will be refunded upon graduation," etc. Needless to say, students who drop out in the middle of the course will consider this ten yuan "gone like a drop in the ocean," and even those who graduate may not be completely reliable. What's more, a few years of "interest-free term deposit" is enough for the principal to "turn it over and over."

Speaking of stationery, most schools now have stationery departments. All large-sized notebooks, small-sized notebooks, composition notebooks, foreign-style copying notebooks, and drawing notebooks have prescribed formats. In order to show "spiritual uniformity," students "should urgently" purchase these notebooks. However, under this "spiritual uniformity" and "should urgently," students' expenses have increased again.

### Why Are There So Many Postage Dues?

--Xue Liang

"Why are there so many postage due letters?" When I picked up a postage due postcard marked with the letter "T," this question arose in my mind. Many letters (in fact, they are basically just a few scolding words) are intentionally sent without stamps so that the other party has to pay a few cents. Many people are wronged because they do not understand the method of packaging (for example, putting printed matter in a sealed envelope); they do not know that certain stamps have been discontinued, and it is very common to be charged postage due. Here, let the author write some common sense about affixing stamps:

(1) Do not use discontinued stamps. For example, the sailboat stamps and the recently issued Sino-American commemorative stamps have been discontinued today.

(2) It is best to go to the nearby post office to ask about the fees for airmail before affixing stamps arbitrarily. The fees for sending to North China, Central China, and South China, and the occupied areas are different and must be noted.

(3) Do not cut off the postage stamp on the postcard and affix it to the letter. At the same time, when writing a postcard, remember not to write on the stamp, otherwise, it will be treated as "postage due."

(4) When affixing stamps, it is best to use one as much as possible. For example, when sending to other places, affix a five-cent stamp. The position for affixing stamps is the upper left corner for Chinese envelopes and the upper right corner for Western envelopes.

(5) Some people also write a few secret codes or sign a name on the stamps as a symbol to avoid others opening them—in fact, this is a big mistake.

(6) Do not affix damaged stamps.

(7) Do not include letters in books or printed matter, otherwise, the postage will be charged according to the weight of the item as postage due.

(8) Letters are charged in units of twenty grams. For example, a normal letter weighing twenty-five grams to another place should have a ten-cent stamp. If only a five-cent stamp is affixed, it will be charged postage due. (It is best to weigh overly heavy letters at the post office first to avoid delays)

(9) It is also wrong to seal the envelope tightly and write "printed matter" on the front of the envelope and affix stamps according to the printed matter rate. The packaging of printed matter, trade contracts, samples, and other mail should be easy to inspect.

(10) Open letters are also charged as letters. Therefore, do not think that you can reduce the postage by not sealing the envelope tightly.

Postage due mail is a loss for both private and public entities, so I hope this article can arouse the attention of the general public to postage due letters.

### The Genius Director – Ernst Lubitsch

— Qinghui

When it comes to directors, Ernst Lubitsch is probably the most popular. Indeed, every film he directs is wonderfully brilliant and endlessly watchable. However, we only see his art and not the man himself, which is a bit of a pity. Now, let me tell you about his success story and private life, which I think everyone would be very interested in knowing!

Lubitsch in Brief: He is a resolute and bold middle-aged man, upright and generous, amiable, with a very sincere smile on his face. His personality is gentle, refined, and full of humor. He has grey-black hair, bright eyes, slightly dark skin, a height of three feet eleven inches, and weighs one hundred and seventy pounds. From a distance, he looks somewhat like Wallace Beery.

Path to Success: Lubitsch was born in Berlin. At the age of six, he aspired to be a stage celebrity. His father, a businessman, insisted that he study commerce for three years and then practice in his own store. However, he never forgot his ambition. He studied commerce during the day and drama at night. Later, he was discovered by the famous drama professor Mr. Helling, who nurtured him and greatly improved his dramatic skills. He specialized in playing humorous roles, able to imbue solemnity with humor. Soon, he moved to Ufa Company to star in comedies, and then directed comedies and eventually feature films. His dramatic talents were occasionally displayed, shocking Europe and America. Due to the global sensation of the film "Carmen," he was hired by Paramount Pictures at a high price to serve as the company's producer and manager. As a result, hit films poured in like a spring.

Elegant Style: His style is known for its humor and elegance, with a generous spirit, appealing to both refined and popular tastes, suitable for young and old alike. Moreover, with his many years of rich experience, outstanding talent, boldness, and attention to detail, he uses humor to satirize the world. Each film he makes, from beginning to end, gives the audience a light and satisfying feeling. Any film bearing the words "Directed by Ernst Lubitsch" will undoubtedly sell out. His artistic height and magical power are definitely unmatched by other directors.

Loves Fishing: In his private life, Ernst Lubitsch is a hardworking fisherman. He likes to fish in icy harbors, no matter how cold the weather is, even when the sea surface freezes into hard ice and his hands and feet become numb and lose sensation. However, he cannot extinguish his will to fish. When he is fishing, there is no "suffering," only "work"!

Special Skill: He also has a special skill, which is that he is most capable of laughing. Although everyone can do it, only his laughter conveys emotion most effectively. He said, "Once, I felt something because of laughter, which is that we can use laughter to convey various feelings. Laughter is a kind of nervousness or a sign of contempt. So I practiced laughing skills. Sometimes I would laugh in front of the mirror by myself and listen carefully to the sound of laughter. I should also thank laughter because it led me on the road to success."

Island Drama Talk

### Further Discussion on the Disciples of Wang Yaoqing

— Weiwei

Today, coinciding with the sixtieth birthday of the veteran actor Wang Yaoqing, Wang's disciples initiated a celebration for their teacher, performing plays and offering toasts, a grand occasion. Yesterday's newspaper carried an article by Bingjiu Jun entitled "Talking about the Disciples of Wang Yaoqing," but the information in that article is somewhat inaccurate. Corrections are as follows:

Bingjiu Jun mentioned that Wang Yaoqing's disciples include two dozen male actors (including the amateur actor Zhang Xiaoshan). Listed among them are Rong Diexian, Wang Huifang, Jiang Miaoxiang, and the Four Great Dan actors, which is actually incorrect. Rong Diexian did indeed belong to Wang Yaoqing's school, but Wang Huifang, Jiang Miaoxiang, and Mei Lanfang, one of the Four Great Dan actors, were not Wang Yaoqing's disciples. Wang Yaoqing was a disciple of Chen Shitou Delin, and Huifang, Miaoxiang, and Lanfang were among the six major disciples of the Chen school (the so-called six major disciples of the Chen school being Wang Yaoqing, Wang Huifang, Jiang Miaoxiang, Mei Lanfang, Wang Qinong, and Yao Yufu). They were not master and disciples with Wang Yaoqing, but rather direct fellow disciples. Furthermore, Shang Xiaoyun was also not a disciple of Wang Yaoqing, but a contemporary of the six major disciples of the Chen school. As for Cheng Yanqiu, he was a disciple of Rong Diexian and thus a grand-disciple of Wang Yaoqing. In addition to the above, Bingjiu Jun also omitted Jin Biyan and Song Dezhu. Biyan studied acting with Wang Yaoqing for a long time and received Wang Yaoqing's personal instruction, becoming one of Wang's inner disciples. Song Dezhu joined Wang Yaoqing's school the latest, becoming Wang's youngest disciple.

Among Wang Yaoqing's disciples, the one who received Wang Yaoqing's greatest affection was undoubtedly Cheng Yuqing. Wang Yaoqing imparted almost everything he knew to Yuqing. Yuqing's dramatic skills are also commendable. Therefore, many of the female actors who joined Wang's school in recent years, such as Du Liyun, Hua Huilin, and Zhang Eyun, mostly learned their skills from Yuqing. Zhao Tongshan (Furong Cao) had the deepest relationship with Wang Yaoqing and imitated Wang Yaoqing's art most closely, so Tongshan was also Wang Yaoqing's favorite disciple. As for the female actors, Wang Yurong was closest to Wang Yaoqing. Yurong was very respectful to Wang Yaoqing. Wang Yurong's success today can be said to be the result of Wang Yaoqing's efforts, and Yurong's art was indeed carefully guided by Wang Yaoqing, which is different from Wang Yaoqing's teaching of Liyun, Huilin, and others. In recent years, those who study Dan roles all strive to join Wang Yaoqing's school, so it is difficult to count how many disciples Wang has. Wang Yaoqing once taught at the Peking Opera School, and Zhao Jinrong and others also studied under Wang Yaoqing. The above is a brief note on the slight discrepancies in Bingjiu Jun's article. It is not nitpicking, but there is a need for correction.

### A Study of the Characters in the Film "Confucius" (2)

— Tianye (Illustration), Qingniao (Writing)

The wise elder Zhong You, a brave man, courtesy name Zilu, also known as Jilu, was nine years younger than Confucius. He was decisive, upright, courageous, and talented, known for his political affairs. He often gave Confucius straightforward and extreme advice, which Confucius never found offensive. In his later years, he served in the state of Wei. During the rebellion in Wei, he fought valiantly with the rebels and died. He upheld the Confucian teachings and did not remove his hat even in death.

### Saying That Another Strong General of Yue Fei is Weakened

— Yuxiu

Zhou Yiliang was a "close-door disciple" of the late Yue opera master Zhong Shiliang of the Guangyu Society. He had been a disciple for only a short time when Zhong Shiliang passed away. However, his teacher liked this young disciple the most, believing that he could inherit his mantle, so he entrusted all his precious scripts to him before his death, with great expectations.

However, Zhou Yiliang, after all, had too short a time with his teacher, and the number of stories he heard was limited. At the same time, there were many senior disciples, such as Li Hanchen and Wang Zailiang, who had long been independent in the opera world. It was very difficult for him to stand out in such a situation. So he came up with a unique idea and created a "Later Biography of Yue Fei" to attract attention.

Although there is such a story as the Later Biography of Yue Fei, the narrators of the Biography of Yue Fei never tell it, and even the audience does not feel any interest in it. However, since Zhou Yiliang revived the old play and started telling the Later Biography of Yue Fei, from "Sweeping Qin" to "Capturing Wen Tianxiang Nine Times," it became popular for a while, surpassing the previous Biography of Yue Fei and dominating the Book of Yue Fei.

Zhou Yiliang's best performance was "Sweeping Qin," in which his interpretation of the role of the mad monk, his performance style, hand gestures, posture, and acting, were all perfect and fascinating. Therefore, whenever he performed a "meeting book," he always used the "Sweeping Qin" section to send off the audience, winning a full house of praise. He never skimped on his performances, and each role was fully realized, always maintaining the inherent style of "a strong momentum in a large book." Due to excessive grief, he contracted hemoptysis and became addicted to opium. Later, he suffered from poverty and illness, and recently died suddenly at the age of only forty.

In the fifteenth and sixteenth years of the Republic of China, Zhou Yiliang came to Shanghai once and performed at the Deyi Lou in the City God Temple. The Shanghai audience, feeling refreshed, flocked to him, and his career flourished, almost filling the seats. As a result, Zhou Yiliang became a highly popular master storyteller. Unfortunately, it was a fleeting moment, and he never came to Shanghai again, so the impression of him among the current Shanghai audience may have already faded.

### Zhou Xuan Stars in "Street Angel"

— Xinren

Recently, folk story films have come to an end, and fashion films are on the rise. However, limited by the environment, they will appear in the form of songs. Guohua will shoot "Street Angel," starring Zhou Xuan, Baiyun, Murong Wan'er, and dozens of male and female singers. There will be many songs, produced by several major musicians in Shanghai. Wu Cun will direct the film. The momentum is very grand. The film has already started shooting. When it is completed, it will surely cause a sensation. New actors will also be invited to participate in the performance. The reporter specially visited Zhou Xuan, the protagonist of the film, yesterday. According to her, "Street Angel" will start filming in a week.

### Disney Searches for Long Legs

— Huazhi

After the cartoon master Walt Disney caused a worldwide sensation with "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" two years ago, he continued his research, thinking that since dwarfs have so many laughs, wouldn't tall people have some interesting aspects? He had the idea of drawing a film like "Land of the Giants." Coincidentally, one of his cartoon company's employees, named Keith Lou, is six feet three inches tall. Although he cannot be ranked as first-class, he can be considered a tall person. This person first organized a "Long Legs Club" in California, inviting long-legged comrades to share their feelings and experiences. The joys of long legs include seeing the scenery in a crowd without looking up to others and being able to move objects at high places at will. The difficulties include not being able to fit in the small seats in movie theaters and wasting materials when making clothes, which are difficult for outsiders to understand. For a while, many members joined to support the club and collect a lot of ready-made materials for Disney.

The organization of this Long Legs Club has spread to various places. For example, one recently appeared in Pittsburgh. Both men and women can join. The qualifications for men to join are a height of six feet four inches or more, and the qualifications for women are a height of five feet or more. There are many members, and the president is a capable woman. Their purpose seems to be very pure, and the members are all very happy. In reality, perhaps they are all characters in future cartoons.
