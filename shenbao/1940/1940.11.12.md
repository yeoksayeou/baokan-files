Editorial

### Looking at Japan by Observing the Soviet Union

Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, broke through his static state of not leaving the country and announced a formal visit to Berlin, the capital of Germany. He set off the day before yesterday and arrived yesterday. Undoubtedly, this is another extremely gloomy and fascinating prelude to the ever-changing international situation in recent times, attracting worldwide attention.

In previous years, Litvinov had repeatedly visited many countries, even when he was still the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, the predecessor of Molotov. Therefore, this time Molotov's visit to Germany is only his maiden voyage after taking office and cannot be hastily symbolized as a special action of Soviet diplomacy. Moreover, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop personally visited the Soviet capital last autumn. According to international practice, reciprocity is the rule, and Molotov should reciprocate the visit. It cannot be hastily judged as an abnormal intimacy between the two countries. This is a normal and superficial observation. Under this observation, it is also seen that Moscow does not currently have any important diplomatic negotiations that are difficult to resolve and are actively underway. Otherwise, how could Molotov take the time to travel far at this time? Therefore, what the Japanese side has been spreading, how the new ambassador to the Soviet Union, Jian San, is active and effective in the Soviet capital, still needs to be investigated.

In this extraordinary period of international affairs, the Soviet Foreign Minister's reciprocal visit to the German capital should not be taken lightly. Last autumn, the German Foreign Minister visited the Soviet Union and signed the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact, which led to today's world. Now, although it is not necessary to formally infer that Molotov's trip will have plans and achievements that are exactly the same, the nature of this trip is not just to reciprocate the visit. In addition to the reciprocal visit, there must be another mission. What is the mission? Outsiders cannot know for sure, only by waiting for further reports can we be able to determine how the situation will unfold. But at this moment, Germany has already gained considerable benefits. Both sides are at war, with Germany and Britain as the main opposing protagonists. Among the neutral countries that can be called pivotal, the United States and the Soviet Union are mentioned in the same breath. The distance, closeness, joy, and sorrow in between are closely related to the domestic morale and public opinion, the international division and allegiance, and the future of the war situation. Now, with all eyes on them, everyone is scrambling to court the Soviet Union, fearing to fall behind. However, the Soviet Foreign Minister accepted the German invitation and set out. This is not only undeniable in Britain, but also, in Germany's domestic and international affairs, what kind of fresh material can this be used to recruit and call for? It is conceivable that the grand occasion of Berlin welcoming Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov yesterday and today may surpass the excitement and fanfare of Führer Hitler's triumphant return from Paris. The capitulation of France is a partial victory in the war, while welcoming this distinguished guest has boundless prospects, a prelude to a major diplomatic victory.

Prelude, just a prelude. The future is uncertain, unknowable. The world certainly has no way of knowing the contents of Molotov's mission, let alone imagine the outcome of the negotiations between the two sides. Suppose: Molotov represents the Soviet Union and goes to Berlin to support Germany and Italy's so-called creation of a new European order, and even goes to Berlin to accept the leadership of the leaders of the new order. Or suppose: Molotov goes to Germany, maintains equal status, abandons peace from now on, concludes an alliance with Germany, and declares war on Britain. Or suppose: the Soviet Union is prepared to sacrifice Turkey, sell out the Slavic origins of Southeast Europe, and support Germany and Italy's conquest of the Balkans. Or suppose: the Soviet Union has pre-recognized Germany's final victory, so Molotov is sent to Berlin to sign a preliminary coupon for the spoils. If any of these assumptions come true, then German diplomacy will be a great victory. But in normal and ordinary wisdom, one cannot help but recognize any of these assumptions as just assumptions: it is a miracle to imagine that assumptions will come true!

Six days ago, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, Kalinin, solemnly stated that in the future, it will be difficult for the Soviet Union to maintain its impartial policy in international affairs for a long time. Coupled with Molotov's visit to Germany yesterday, if the two are combined and extended, it can be most simply explained as a sign that the Soviet Union is helping Germany fight Britain. We now have no definitive evidence or proof that can disprove the establishment of this sign. At the same time, we also believe that the two cannot be so simply explained. Because Kalinin's speech and Molotov's trip are two things with the same intention. It can be regarded as a sign that the Soviet Union is helping Germany fight Britain, and it can also be regarded as a warning that it will no longer tolerate Germany and Italy's wilful actions. It can also be regarded as implying to both Britain and Germany that it is waiting for a good price to sell, and it may not be impossible to try to resolve the difficulties. In short, both can advance and retreat, go left and right, swirl and tumble, and each has an extremely large angle and extremely large freedom to stretch, choose, and abandon at will. At this time when each is possible and yet each is unsatisfactory, it is too early to judge, and it is also too early to worry or be happy. If we try to infer, the Soviet Union is not so eager to try to get involved in the international vortex that it cannot bear it, but rather it is gradually feeling cramped and unable to settle down. Therefore, it either hopes to alleviate the overall situation, or hopes to stabilize a corner, or attempts to move the flames away from its own eyes and develop in other directions. If it is said that the Soviet Union is a little lonely and does not hesitate to jump into the whirlpool and climb into the fire pit to save people, this is an unimaginable change. Molotov will never return quietly, and the Soviet Union will never remain silent. Please watch with wide eyes the facts that will be manifested in the next few days!

### U.S.-Japan Relations Have Entered a Serious Stage; Japan's Destruction of Treaties Makes the United States Wary; Future War in the Pacific Is Inevitable

Washington: Well-informed observers here recently stated that U.S.-Japan relations, since Tokyo joined the Rome-Berlin Axis, have become increasingly strained due to the development of various factors in the minds of the two peoples that are sufficient to aggravate political and diplomatic relations. Although people here have not yet predicted the possibility of war between the two countries, many observers believe that the policy currently adopted by Japan will make the United States' policy toward the Pacific more resolute. Many believe that neither the United States nor Japan can rely on the friendship between the two countries in the past as a guarantee for future difficulties, nor can either government take a measure that can generate a future friendship and favorable commercial relations to dispel the dissatisfaction of public opinion and politicians in each other's countries. The American people, whether fair or extreme in their views, believe that Japan has resorted to force on its own to resolve diplomatic and political issues. The occupation of Manchuria, the invasion of North China, and the subsequent expansion of its military operations in most parts of China, the Panay incident, the repeated bombing of Chinese cities, and the armed invasion of French Indochina, all these have made public opinion believe that Japan's policy cannot deviate from violent actions. Japan's recent attack on Vietnam has further strengthened this belief, and now there are reports that Japan will use violence to threaten the Dutch East Indies. According to various sources, Japan's opinion is that the United States has failed to understand or accurately assess the important facts such as population, economy, and external stimuli that are suitable for Japan's Far Eastern policy, and believes that the four powers cannot readily recognize its increased international status, its increased wealth, its increased industrial power, and its increased significance to the international community, which are necessary for the fate of the country. Finally, Japan has also been very dissatisfied with various actions of the United States over the years, such as the Japanese Exclusion Act of 1924, and regards it as an insult to the Japanese nation, and the California Land Restriction Law, which the Japanese also regard as discriminatory treatment against Japanese races and Japanese economic interests. In addition, Japanese politicians and newspapers often resent the United States, such as the United States urging Britain to abandon the Anglo-Japanese Alliance in 1922, and the United States revising the Lansing-Ishii Agreement of 1917, which recognized Japan's "special interests" in certain parts of China, are also matters of dissatisfaction among the Japanese. Regardless of whether Japan's various motives and claims are justified, Japan's actions are in fact challenging or destroying the various international procedures established by the United States. The Washington Naval Limitation Conference from 1920 to 1922 was nominally an achievement, but the facts of the next ten years have destroyed the two purposes of the United States, which were to reduce military injuries and maintain the Open Door policy in China. The United States needed a naval force balance based on a 5:3 ratio. The United States claimed high figures, arguing that Japan had a geographical advantage in any possible war, so the United States had to have a larger naval force. In fact, the U.S. Navy actually bears the practical responsibility of two oceans. This 5:3 ratio was later cancelled after the London Naval Conference in 1936. The Washington Conference also agreed on a Nine-Power Treaty and other agreements, stipulating that all countries should respect China's territorial integrity and respect the principle of equal trade opportunities. Japan's occupation of Manchuria and later the occupation of vast areas of mainland China have been considered by people here to be far away from the principles of these treaties and agreements. The U.S. government, Congress, and the public also celebrated the establishment of the Kellogg-Briand Pact in 1928, recognizing this as an important achievement in world affairs, an effective tool for world peace, and sufficient to supplement the shortcomings of the League of Nations rules. Japan's occupation of Manchuria in 1932 led the American people to feel disappointed in the effectiveness of this pact. The U.S. view has been specifically stated in a famous note sent by former U.S. Secretary of State Stimson to China and Japan on January 7, 1932. In this note, the U.S. government warned China and Japan that the U.S. government could not recognize any situation of facts as legal, and had no intention of recognizing any treaties or agreements between China and Japan that could affect China's central power, independence, and territorial integrity, or related to the policies of various countries toward China, such as the Open Door Policy, and damage the treaty rights or interests of the United States in China. The U.S. government has no intention of recognizing any situation treaty or agreement that would violate the obligations of the Pact of Paris, which was signed by China, Japan, and the United States on August 27, 1928. These words are still the fixed policy of the United States. The Lugouqiao Incident in July 1937 has proven to be the prelude to Japan's invasion of most of China. These military actions clearly violate most of the U.S. policies toward China and the international community. This conflict of interest became acute in December 1937, when Japanese naval aircraft sank the gunboat Panay, killing and injuring many people. Although the Japanese government later formally acknowledged that it was an "unfortunate incident" and provided compensation to the victims and their families, this incident has been deeply etched in the minds of the American people and has had a great impact on U.S.-Japan relations. On January 10, 1938, U.S. Secretary of State Hull wrote a letter to Vice President Garner, which became a fundamental principle of U.S. policy toward the world and the Far East. In the letter, Hull stated that, regarding the situation in the Far East, the United States is deeply concerned about supporting forces that are conducive to maintaining and encouraging the cause of peace through peaceful means. Japanese air raids on Chinese cities have made the United States wary of Japan, and the ban on aircraft to Japan and the change in the U.S. attitude toward Europe and Japan on the issue of the Mandate System have also caused difficulties in U.S.-Japan relations. The original intention of the Mandate System was an altruistic method to promote the interests of semi-civilized regions in the world, but in fact, Japan's mandated territories in the Pacific have gradually become "unseen places" for the United States, and the American public opinion believes that these mandated territories have become Japanese naval bases in the Pacific. For more than ten years, the views of the United States and Japan on the Pacific and the Far East have become increasingly distant, and the announcement of the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan has further made U.S.-Japan relations a serious state. The United States, which advocates assisting democratic countries with all resources except war, suddenly feels that it is confronting the alliance of this omnipotent country in the Pacific, and this fact has given the U.S. defense program a great stimulus and made the people of the world imagine the possibility of a future Pacific war.

### Japan Prepares to Invade the Dutch East Indies; New York Newspaper's Prediction

### Japan to Hold Important Meeting

Tokyo: Prime Minister Konoe will hold an important meeting with the Navy and Army Ministers this week to discuss the adjustment plan of the military and government administration departments.

Before Konoe formed the cabinet on July 21, the Prime Minister and the Foreign, Navy, and Army Ministers had reached an agreement on national defense, diplomacy, and the adjustment of the military and government administration departments. Subsequently, the Navy and Army Ministries repeatedly consulted on adjustment methods, and only recently did they agree on the plan. (Reuters dispatch on the 11th)

### Arnold's Advocacy for Active Aid to China, Warning the United States Against Withdrawing from the Far East, Grew's Emergency Meeting with Matsuoka

San Francisco - Arnold, the former U.S. Deputy Commercial Attaché to Shanghai, recently stated that Japan is currently employing blitzkrieg tactics against the United States in an attempt to expel the latter from the Pacific. Unless the United States acts promptly, Arnold, who served in Shanghai for 38 years before recently returning to the United States, said, "The most serious point of the Sino-Japanese War lies in Japan's determination to completely sever China's external transportation. Although China's resistance and fighting spirit have already checked the Japanese army, which is far superior in equipment, there is concern that they may not be able to sustain their military defense structure in the future." He further warned the United States that if it wishes to maintain its reputation, authority, and interests in the Far East, it should immediately abandon its frequent public statements about not being prepared to fight there or unwilling to join the conflict in the Far East. He stated that if the United States adopts this policy, it will not only lose all its rights and interests, but also proposed a nineteen-point program to stop Japan's advance: (1) Stop making statements such as "No matter what fate befalls China, the United States will never participate in the war." (2) Stop adopting a wait-and-see policy towards the Japanese government. (3) Organize a non-partisan intelligence committee to observe the Far Eastern situation with the spirit of the Supreme Court. (4) Take precautionary steps to deal with Japanese aggression. (5) Intensify the embargo on war materials to Japan and prevent the continuation of loans to it. (6) Organize commercial institutions interested in the Far East as a collective guarantee against Japanese commercial competition. (7) Provide China with credit and financial loans. (8) Help China maintain its transportation with the outside world to ensure the continuation of its war effort. (9) Assist in China's financial recovery. He also stated, "The value of providing China with necessary assistance is far greater than the cost of fighting Japan in the future. The fate of our country is closely tied to how we handle our responsibility as a Pacific nation." (United Press, November 11)

Tokyo - U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, held a two-hour discussion with Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka yesterday. Grew went to Matsuoka's private residence on Sunday for an emergency meeting. The content of this long conversation has not been disclosed. (United Press, November 11)

Chongqing - The Central Daily News today published a special article by Chen Bosheng, predicting Japan's future actions. It stated that after President Roosevelt's re-election, Japan's policies towards Britain and the United States will undergo fundamental changes. Japan's military strength is insufficient to fight Britain and the United States simultaneously. Japan deeply understands that empty threats will be of no avail in the future. Japan's only path forward is to resolve the Far Eastern issue based on the fundamental principles proposed by Britain and the United States. We firmly believe that within six months, Britain and the United States can defeat Japan without war and force it to accept their conditions for a fundamental resolution of the Far Eastern issue. We hope that Britain and the United States, especially President Roosevelt, can understand this point and apply great pressure on Japan, and Japan will have no choice but to yield.

### Following Pittman's Passing, U.S. Senate Adjourns in Mourning, Vacancy of President Pro Tempore Temporarily Unfilled, Foreign Relations Committee Chairmanship to be Succeeded by George

Washington - The sudden passing of Pittman has shocked Washington. President Roosevelt immediately sent a message of condolence to his wife, saying, "The sudden news of the death of my old friend Pittman has shocked and saddened me deeply! At this time of global survival, our Senate President Pro Tempore and Chairman of the important Foreign Relations Committee has passed away, and the nation has lost a mentor! Thirty-nine years of deep friendship and unwavering loyalty, now he has passed away, and my wife and I are deeply saddened." Secretary of State Hull also expressed his condolences, saying, "I am deeply saddened by this terrible news! It has been a great honor to work with Pittman and have a close friendship for many years.

Washington - After Pittman's death, Senator Walter George of Georgia is the most likely candidate to fill the vacancy of Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. George is a conservative Democrat. During the 1938 Roosevelt presidential election, there was an attempt to purge conservative elements from the Democratic Party, but it was ultimately defeated by the conservatives, and George was one of those who defeated this attempt. Senator Harrison of Mississippi, currently a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee, predicted last night that George would be unanimously elected as Chairman of the Committee, as this move would cause him to resign from the highly influential Senate Finance Committee. George opposes many of President Roosevelt's domestic policies but strongly supports his foreign policy. (United Press, November 11)

Although those who leave can state their desired destination, the government does not guarantee that it will comply. It is reported that Fiji is willing to accept 500 Chinese, with transportation costs paid by the government, but the cost of living may have to be covered by the evacuees themselves.

### Moscow Issues Communiqué, Soviet Union to Maintain Neutrality, Molotov May Arrive in Germany Today, Important Consultations in Berlin

Moscow - As the Soviet Foreign Minister is rushing to Berlin, the Soviet government announced today that the Soviet Union will maintain neutrality in the European war. Well-informed sources believe that Molotov's large delegation proves that the Soviet Union and Germany may sign an important agreement in Berlin. The Soviet communiqué issued today stated, "The Soviet Union intends to adhere to its neutral policy. Regarding this matter, Kalinin briefly mentioned it in his speech on Wednesday." It is generally believed that the upcoming talks in Berlin may resolve the disputes between the Soviet Union and Japan and create the possibility of a new agreement between the two countries. Yesterday was the 2600th anniversary of Japan's founding. The Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tatekawa, held a reception in Moscow, which was attended by a large number of Soviet officials. Political circles here also attach great importance to this matter. (International News Service, November 11)

The station was filled with red flags and flowers, and the spotlights illuminated the station, creating a radiant scene that was reflected in the falling snow. Soviet newspapers remained silent about Molotov's mission to Germany, but diplomatic circles believe that its impact on Europe will be significant, and perhaps on the Far East as well. (United Press, November 11)

Moscow - Molotov's entourage to Berlin totals thirty-two people. Alexandrov, Director of the Central European Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Pavlov, Director of the Legal Department, German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Dr. Schnurre, head of the German trade delegation, Counselor Warlo, and Hilger also accompanied him.

The "Volkischer Beobachter" and the "Lokalanzeiger" both published a large photograph of Molotov on the front page. German official newspapers published official announcements, announcing Molotov's impending arrival but making no comments on the trip. As for foreign newspapers, there is no official news to be gleaned. Many believe that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will greet Molotov in Danzig. Molotov may arrive in Danzig on Tuesday, and then travel by plane to Berlin with Ribbentrop. (United Press, November 11)

Basel - A correspondent from the Basler Nachrichten in Berlin cabled that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has gone to Königsberg in East Prussia to greet Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. (Reuters, November 11)

### The Status of Countries Bordering will be Re-examined by Soviets and Germans

Berlin - Today, Berlin newspapers continued to prominently feature news and commentaries about the upcoming visit of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to Germany. The newspapers solemnly stated that this is the first time a Soviet leader has decided to travel abroad, and the impression this has made on the Soviet people is extremely profound. Soviet newspapers also published this news with large headlines. Marshal Göring's mouthpiece, the "Essener National Zeitung," made a detailed commentary this morning, stating that Molotov's visit is of extraordinary significance. Although the established treaties and contracts stipulate that important issues should be discussed frequently, his visit to Berlin is undoubtedly significant. With the continuation and expansion of the war beyond Western Europe, such measures are necessary. At this time when Britain is on the verge of collapse, extremely important issues will inevitably arise. Therefore, his visit to Berlin indicates that a united front against Britain on the European continent is about to begin. If such extraordinary gains can be achieved during short-term Soviet-German cooperation, and both countries can simultaneously restore all the territories lost during World War I, then further cooperation between the two countries will surely yield even greater gains in the future. The two governments are now using the established treaty of friendship as the foundation for further cooperation between the two nations. Countries bordering Germany and the Soviet Union that have not yet decided on their policies should re-examine their status and policies during Molotov's visit to Germany. Turkey is one such country. Soviet-German understanding will also affect the Far East, and Soviet-Japanese relations are also improving daily. This move can free the Soviet Union and Japan from their constraints and allow them to focus their efforts elsewhere. Britain is currently working to undermine Soviet-German understanding because, for its own benefit, it has consistently prevented the natural development of the two countries. Now that an understanding has been reached, the two countries are determined to adopt a united anti-British policy. What is currently being discussed are the issues arising from the war and the establishment of new agreements to pave the way for the future. The current task is to enhance Soviet-German common relations and to determine how backward countries in Europe and Asia will be positioned in the future new order. (Haitong News Agency, November 11)

Rome - Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gayda, wrote in the newspaper yesterday that if Britain intends to expand in the Mediterranean, it will inevitably face resistance from the Soviet Union. In his comprehensive analysis of the European situation, Gayda praised the Soviet Union's policies towards Europe and Asia. Gayda also warned Turkey not to resist the Axis powers at Britain's urging.

Petropavlovsk is the administrative city of the Kamchatka region and also an educational center. There is a normal school and a political training school in the city. In addition, a fishing school is about to be established. The surrounding mountains provide citizens with places for skating and other sports, and are also a place for fox hunting. In short, Petropavlovsk is the Soviet Union's easternmost vanguard. Midnight at the Moscow Kremlin is sunrise in the city. The city now has very convenient transportation with the Soviet Union. In addition to ships, there are also airplanes carrying goods and passengers. (TASS, November 11)

### On the Pindus Mountain Front, Italian Forces Retreat After Losses, Italian Encirclement Strategy Fails, Greek Forces Continue to Win on Northern Route

Athens - According to the latest Greek military communiqués, it has been confirmed that the elite Italian Alpine Division has been defeated on the Pindus Mountain front. The division included cavalry, the Bersaglieri Regiment (Mussolini was once a member of this regiment during the Great War), and Fascist militia. This operation was an attempt to cut off the transportation of Greek forces in Epirus. However, due to unfavorable circumstances, in order to avoid being surrounded, they abandoned a large amount of baggage and wounded soldiers and fled. Italian forces rushing from Valona to provide support also retreated at the same time. Greek forces captured some enemy soldiers and a large amount of military supplies. Locals believe that the appointment of a new commander-in-chief of the Italian army, coupled with the arrival of a large number of reinforcements from Italy, is proof that the Italian offensive against Greece has been thwarted. (Reuters, November 11)

Southern Capital - According to the "Politiki" newspaper, Greek warships have laid mines in the straits leading to Thessaloniki, Kavala, and other Greek seaports. It has also been learned that British warships have arrived in Thessaloniki. (Haitong News Agency, November 11)

Athens - Greek government officials said that after Greek forces annihilated two Fascist battalions in the Pindus Mountains, an Italian unit sent to rescue the "isolated forces" was also attacked by Greek mountain troops, "like reaping wheat." A supply train rushing to resupply two Italian divisions was heavily attacked by Greek artillery. The original text states that mountain trails were "covered with Italian corpses, and rivers ran red." The Italian reinforcements were the famous Venetian Alpine Division, originally intended for blitzkrieg operations, but now no longer exists, as they were either captured or fled. Greek headquarters also stated that there have been continued victories in the Korytsa-Florina area. Authoritative sources claimed that Greek anti-aircraft fire has shot down eleven Italian aircraft since the start of the war, mostly the latest long-range bombers. However, Italian aircraft shot down by Greek aircraft in air combat are not included in this number. British aircraft launched from Greek territory have attacked Valona twice, damaging many aircraft and aircraft on the ground. Two Italian barges loaded with aircraft were sunk by British and Greek aircraft. (United Press, November 11)

Athens - The Greek High Command stated that Greek forces defending Yannina defeated two more Italian battalions. After this setback, Italian forces in the western Ionian coast area retreated yesterday. Official reports state that two Italian mechanized battalions were completely annihilated in the Kalamas River area yesterday. The people of Athens were still celebrating Saturday's victory yesterday. The news of the above-mentioned victory has further boosted Athenian morale. Officials said that yesterday's new victory has made the Greek position in the war more favorable. Greece's chances are now better than when the Italian army began invading Greece. At the same time, it was heard that Italian forces are now using paratroopers in the mountainous area of Korytsa, dropping food and orders to troops trapped in the mountains. (International News Service, November 11)

Southern Capital - This morning, it was learned here that Italian forces are actively engaged on the Albanian-Greek front. The Italian air force is bombing concentrated Greek troops. Italian artillery continues to bombard Greek positions. Italian reinforcements have arrived on the front lines. (Haitong News Agency, November 11)

### Greek Forces Capture Thousands of Italian Soldiers in the Pindus Mountains

Athens - The Greek High Command announced today that thousands of Italian soldiers were captured in the Pindus Mountains last night. A communiqué issued by the Italian High Command stated that these Italian soldiers preferred to be captured rather than starve or be annihilated, so they surrendered without offering any resistance. Greek forces also seized a large number of artillery pieces, tanks, and a large amount of military supplies. However, the Greek side acknowledged that although Greek reinforcements arrived in the mountainous area in a timely manner, the number of Greek casualties is still very significant. According to battle reports arriving here today, Greek forces are now advancing to the south bank of the Kalamas River. It is generally believed that the Greek victory on the front lines has removed the direct threat to Yannina and thwarted the Italian offensive against Epirus. At the same time, Greek forces in the west are stepping up their encirclement of Korytsa, seizing a large amount of Italian supplies and repelling Italian reinforcements. It is reported that the Royal Air Force has assisted the Greek Air Force in bombing the key Albanian port of Vlora and the Italian bases of Brindisi and Taranto. The joint British and Greek bombing of Italian bases has greatly hampered the movement of Italian reinforcements and the supply of supplies via the Strait of Taranto. At the same time, it was learned that U.S. Minister to Greece MacVeagh informed Greek Prime Minister Metaxas that the United States is willing to provide medical supplies to Greece.

### British Aircraft Stationed in Crete, Islanders Form Irregular Army

London - A Reuters correspondent in Greek-owned Crete cabled that the hatred of the Cretan islanders towards the Italians is now greater than ever. This is the only effect of the Italian air raids on the island. After British aircraft arrived on the island to be stationed, the islanders' belief became stronger, all saying that since British aircraft have now come to protect them, Italian aircraft will not dare to come again to carry out wanton killings. The chieftains of the various tribes on the island have already gathered the brave and skilled islanders and are preparing to form an irregular Cretan army to assist the Greek forces on the island in combat. (Reuters, November 11)

### Italian Side Uses Aircraft to Supply Mountain Climbing Troops with Food and Ammunition

Southern Capital - According to news from the Politiki newspaper here, yesterday was peaceful on the Greek front due to extremely adverse weather conditions. Heavy fog, low-hanging black clouds, and constant rain prevented artillery activity. Soldiers on both sides suffered from the severe cold. Food and ammunition for the Italian mountain climbing troops on the front lines are being supplied by aircraft. Paratroopers were dropped in several places. The Italian advance is clearly visible, with large contingents advancing in an endless stream. The newspaper stated that the Greek situation is quite difficult because supplies are not arriving on time, and reserves are repeatedly hindered in the mountains. According to the Greek side, artillery that the Greek army did not have at the beginning of the war has now been transported to the front lines. They are of a very large caliber and are the latest models. (Haitong News Agency, November 11)

### Continuous Earthquakes in the Balkans: Severe Disaster in Romania; No Intact Buildings in Bucharest; Thousands Dead and Injured; Major Oilfields on Fire

Lisbon - The Coimbra University Observatory reports that an earthquake occurred in the Balkans this morning. (Haitong, 11th)

Vienna - At 0:35 AM (Central European Time) today, another earthquake occurred in Romania. Although it lasted only a few seconds, some houses collapsed. (Haitong, 11th)

London - German radio broadcasts from the official news agency report that Bucharest felt the first earthquake this morning, and it was very strong. (Reuters, 11th)

Bucharest - Since the most violent earthquake in the modern history of the Balkans shook Bucharest and other parts of Romania this morning, the death toll in Bucharest alone is at least several thousand. Two more tremors occurred yesterday at 3 PM and 7 PM, plunging the people of Bucharest back into terror and chaos. Although the houses that did not suffer this great natural disaster were filled with frightened people crying out for refuge, the two earthquakes in the afternoon caused little damage. Since Bucharest suffered five earthquakes, several buildings have collapsed and been damaged, including the Royal Palace, the Foreign Ministry, and the American Embassy. Therefore, Bucharest is now a smoking ruin. Many small cities in Romania have been completely destroyed, and the number of deaths and injuries is increasing. It is learned that when rescue workers were excavating rubble, more than a thousand people died in the cities of Ploiesti, Calarasi, and Giurgiu. Hordes of refugees are entering and leaving Bucharest, as the people do not know where to go to avoid death. According to seasoned observers, they have never experienced such an earthquake in their lives, and the only one that can be compared to it occurred one hundred and thirty-eight years ago. Preliminary investigations indicate that property losses amount to hundreds of millions. The disaster not only struck a large area of Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, but also the oilfields in the area, which are an important source of oil for German war machines, are on fire, according to sources in Ploiesti. German troops stationed in Romania are assisting the public in excavating rubble piles to save lives and property. No building in Bucharest was spared damage in this earthquake. According to official statistics, six hundred people were crushed to death when the Carlton Palace apartment building, the largest ten-story building in Bucharest, collapsed into a pile of wood and reinforced concrete. The government has used radio to notify all construction engineers to assist the government in selecting which buildings should be demolished to avoid further casualties. Hotels have been converted into hospitals, and the magnificent lounges are filled with ragged and unclean men, women, and children, some squatting and some lying on the floor. The groans of the injured being given first aid are endless. Furthermore, according to officials, if the firefighters had not worked quickly, the entire city would have been reduced to ashes. Yesterday, it was reported that several high-ranking German and Italian military officers had died, but this has not yet been fully confirmed. The buildings on Bulevardul Bratianu and Bulevardul Brezoianu have been almost completely destroyed. The epicenter of the earthquake seemed to be in the center of Bucharest. Several sections of the railroad were broken, and the post office building was completely ruined. (International, 11th)

London - According to reports received in London, the earthquake in Bucharest yesterday caused considerable damage. The eight-story Carlton Building collapsed, and it is feared that up to two hundred people were buried in the rubble. The new Romanian Foreign Ministry building was completely cracked from top to bottom, and the fourteen-story telephone company building was also greatly damaged. There are no intact houses in Bucharest. Many streets are impassable due to piles of rubble. The most modern commercial street in Bucharest, Victoria Avenue, is also blocked in many places. The city center is now cordoned off with ropes. Telephone service has been disrupted for a long time, and traffic is restricted. The only vehicles seen on the streets on Sunday morning were ambulances transporting the injured to hospitals. Thirty people died and a hundred were injured in Galati on the Danube River due to the earthquake. In Ploiesti, the center of Romania's oil industry, most of the oil refineries were damaged. The earthquake was also felt in Bulgaria, causing some casualties. An earthquake also occurred in Marseille, France. Romanian radio broadcast a request for all construction engineers in the country to register for service so that they could inspect the condition of buildings and how many people lived there in order to avoid further casualties. Many railway tunnels have cracks, and trains have been suspended, pending inspection by engineers in sections. (Reuters, 11th)

Bucharest - Forty-six bodies were recovered from the ruins of the collapsed twelve-story Carlton Building this morning. Nine of them were still recognizable, while the rest were missing their faces and could not be identified. Seventeen seriously injured people were recovered and are still expected to recover. Only twenty bodies have been found in other ruins in Romania so far. The exact death toll is difficult to obtain at this time. Money and other valuables recovered by the rescue teams from the bodies were handed over to the authorities for safekeeping. German soldiers also participated in the rescue work. According to the Bucharest Observatory, the earthquake lasted forty seconds. According to the Post Office, telephone communications have been mostly restored throughout Romania, but telegraph service has not yet been restored in many places. The telephone exchange building in Bucharest was slightly damaged. Many houses in Ploiesti collapsed. It is now known that seven people died and forty were injured in that city. The number of victims is undoubtedly more than that. Two hundred houses collapsed in the Târgoviște district, and the number of casualties is still being investigated. The Doftana Prison near Câmpina also collapsed, and most of the inmates died under the rubble. It is reported that forty-five people died and more than a hundred were injured in Focșani. The town of Buzău was completely destroyed, and twenty-three bodies and seventy-one injured people were recovered. Thirty bodies were found in Galati today, and more than a thousand people were injured and are now being treated in hospitals. Craiova, which is farther from the epicenter of the earthquake, had several houses collapsed, five deaths, and six serious injuries. (Haitong, 11th)

Sofia, Bulgaria - Following the earthquake in Romania, there are large fires everywhere. The large fires in Romania can be seen across the river from the Danube in Bulgaria. According to information obtained here, several villages in Romania have been completely destroyed. Damage in Bulgaria was minimal, and few people were injured by collapsing houses. The Sofia Earthquake Institute declared that this earthquake was the most severe since 1928. The cities of Plovdiv and Chirpan were largely destroyed in 1928. (Haitong, 11th)

Sofia, Bulgaria - Regarding the earthquake in Romania, according to the Meteorological Observatory here, two earthquakes were felt in various parts of Bulgaria, and there was a rumbling sound underground.

Although the epicenter of the earthquake was in the Balkans, residents of Moscow were awakened from their sleep. Odessa, Poltava, and Akkerman were also affected. Many houses collapsed in Kishinev. The Council of People's Commissars of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic has appointed a relief committee to handle the aftermath. (Haitong, 11th)

### Franco-German Formal Agreement: Negotiations Impossible; Laval Returns to Vichy; French Press Reviews Relations Between the Two Countries

Vichy - Cabinet Minister and Foreign Minister Laval has returned here after talks with German Air Minister General Göring in Paris. Semi-official sources commented that as long as the Anglo-German war continues, there is no room for France and Germany to negotiate and discuss a formal peace agreement. The current issue lies in creating an atmosphere of mutual understanding between France and Germany and enlisting public opinion in both countries to promote rapprochement. The French government's adoption of this policy in the current environment is a wise move, and the outcome will be seen in the future. As for the meeting between Laval and Göring, it was a necessary step after the historic meeting between Marshal Pétain and German Chancellor Hitler in Montoire. In short, the French people should recognize that the Franco-German cooperation policy is the only way for France to recover. (Havas, 10th)

Clermont-Ferrand, France - The newspapers here today continue to focus on Franco-German relations as a topic of commentary. In addition to expressing general opinions, some authors have examined the possibilities of cooperation between the two countries in detail. Frossard, the former Minister of Propaganda and Minister of Information, also published an article in the "Slogan Newspaper," stating that since the Munich Agreement of 1938, most of the French people were very excited, regardless of the fact that this matter damaged the country's prestige. The reason for this is that they hoped that the age-old feud between France and Germany could be eliminated. Therefore, France does not hate Germany, and the same is true in Germany, which has no intention of hating France. Resentment can only arise between them when France tries to enslave Germany or Germany tries to divide France. Conversely, if both parties cooperate under certain conditions, that is, under the condition that the defeated country does not bear unlimited burdens, then cooperation is entirely possible. In short, once the defeated country has paid the price of its defeat, there should no longer be any distinction between the victorious country and the defeated country. Marshal Pétain's recent speech has elaborated on how the German people should deal with victory. (Havas, 10th)

### All of French Equatorial Africa Falls into Free French Hands; Capture of Libreville Confirmed

London - According to military news arriving in London this morning from Léopoldville, General de Gaulle's "Free French Forces" have occupied Libreville, the capital of French Gabon. Therefore, all of France's colonies in Equatorial Africa have come under their control. Informed sources know that the Vichy government has telegraphed the authorities in French Gabon to stop their pointless resistance. The initial report of the attack on Libreville came from the Vichy government, which claimed that a squadron of British light cruisers shelled the city on Saturday, covering the landing of Free French infantry. The Vichy government claimed that the French garrison in Libreville rose up and attacked the landing forces commanded by de Gaulle, leading to fierce fighting. However, the British Admiralty does not believe that the British Navy shelled Libreville or assisted the Free French forces. Today, observers here are satisfied with the success of the attack on Libreville and the occupation of French Gabon. Observers say that this move can greatly eliminate the shameful memory of the failure to attack Dakar, which the British newspapers at the time called "the great failure of Dakar." (International, 11th)

London - The news that General de Gaulle's forces have occupied Libreville in French Equatorial Africa has been officially confirmed by London today. People here believe that the occupation of this important coastal base is an important victory, as the occupation of Libreville can guarantee the safety of the British South Atlantic shipping lanes. It is said that casualties during the shelling of Libreville were relatively light. The local people warmly welcomed General de Gaulle, who has been appointed as the governor of the area. It is said that several British warships are currently anchored in Libreville. (International, 11th)

### Unemployed Japanese Mob Beat Up Officials

Tokyo - The Kokumin Shimbun reports that a high-ranking government official was recently beaten up by a mob of people unemployed due to the new construction movement. This shameful phenomenon is due to the fact that both the official and the unemployed have failed to understand the true meaning of creating a new order. (Reuters, 11th)

### A Painful History of the European War (2) The Great Tragedy of France

Bordeaux was utterly unprepared for the influx of government agencies, diplomatic corps, and the press. The city already held a million refugees, with countless more arriving continuously. The streets were clogged with vehicles, which many refugees used as temporary shelters.

A large number of congressmen, officials, civil servants, and others, sensing the end was near, clung closely to the government. Bankers, industrialists, merchants, writers, and their wives and mistresses all prepared to relocate time and again. The streets, cafes, hotels, consular offices issuing passports, and corridors of various ministries were crammed with people. People met and exchanged news, while spreading baseless rumors. Archduke Otto, the heir to the Habsburg throne, young but already balding, wearing a raincoat and with a furrowed brow, paced back and forth in front of the police station. General Haller, the Polish envoy, with his white beard flowing, was in earnest conversation with former Belgian Prime Minister Pierlot, who was wearing a black coat. The entrance of the Splendide Hotel was crowded with men and women from various branches of the Rothschild financial dynasty, who had fled London, Paris, and Vienna.

Amidst this incredible atmosphere, the French government ministers were meeting several times a day, awaiting the outcome of Reynaud's final appeal to Roosevelt. They were also considering moving the government to Morocco or Algeria, or even to England to continue the war. The temporary residences of the President and the Prime Minister were on the same street, only a hundred yards apart. The road between them was constantly filled with traffic, the cars of high officials coming and going. Cabinet meetings lasted four or five hours. Pétain was ardently calling for an armistice, and his supporters were growing in number. This veteran general, over seventy years old, dressed in his old military uniform, spoke haltingly but with great eloquence. He said, "Gentlemen, please think of France's future. We cannot abandon the country and let it fend for itself, nor can we allow it to be trampled upon by others. We must remain on this sacred land and care for our people. Before the victorious enemy, without hesitation, refuses to negotiate, we must obtain guarantees to protect our youth and our cities and towns. This way, the opportunity for revival can still be in our hands."

Foch, Baudouin, and the newly appointed Minister of Information, Prouvost (publisher of the Paris-Soir newspaper), all stood on the same side, supporting Pétain's insightful views. Prouvost said, "If we move elsewhere from here, the people will not understand. They will think we ran away with the treasure chests."

Pétain continued, "We must hurry, we must hurry. Verdun, Metz, Sedan, Épernay, Belfort, Toul, Chaumont, Orléans have all fallen."

Weygand's headquarters had already moved to Vichy and now had to retreat further to near Bordeaux. Weygand was also summoned to the meeting.

He said, "The situation is beyond repair. The Maginot Line has been bypassed, and the Alpine defenders will soon be surrounded. We have only a few isolated troops fighting on, who cannot communicate with each other or with us. Most of the remaining aircraft have been destroyed on the ground."

Reynaud still wanted to continue the war. He said, "We cannot abandon the fleet. We cannot lose everything, and even more, we cannot lose our honor. The resources of the colonies are still not exhausted." He even telephoned Churchill, urging him to come to Bordeaux for a final meeting. Churchill initially refused but later proposed a new suggestion: the formation of a Franco-British Union, governing both nations together until the end of the war. The resources, wealth, territories, and colonies of both countries would be under the jurisdiction of the Union government.

Monnet supported this suggestion. General de Gaulle was an even more enthusiastic supporter. Other cabinet members believed that this plan would merely place France under British control. Roosevelt's reply to Reynaud's appeal was only empty words of comfort, expressing willingness to support the continuation of the war. At this time, France had only five hundred fighter planes on the front lines.

Parliament was in recess, but several hundred senators and representatives were milling about in the city hall. Among them were many who advocated for an armistice. Only the white-haired President of the Senate, Jeanneney, and the towering President of the Chamber of Deputies, Herriot, opposed surrender.

On the afternoon of June 16, Pétain insisted that the cabinet decide on the major plan of war or peace. Therefore, another meeting was convened, presided over by President Lebrun, who supported Pétain's proposal. Lebrun requested that the cabinet make an immediate decision and suggested that the resolution be signed by the two generals, Pétain and Weygand, and announced to the nation. At this time, everyone knew that the rights of civilian officials had been completely swept away. The people, especially the soldiers, had to accept their fate based solely on the prestige of Pétain and Weygand. Finally, Chautemps tried to mediate the dissenting opinions, proposing that the Swiss government first make a tentative approach to Hitler. Thus, the faction supporting the armistice declared victory.

Reynaud resigned immediately. That evening, Pétain formed a new government, with Weygand as Minister of Defense and Darlan as Minister of the Navy. The elegant Baudouin, who had been attached to Pétain for a week, surprisingly obtained the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs. Laval had spent almost the entire previous day in conversation with the Spanish ambassador to France, Lequerica. Pétain summoned him, intending to offer him the post of Minister of Justice. Laval refused. He would accept nothing less than the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was afraid of bearing the infamy of signing the armistice agreement and had no real intention of joining the cabinet. Finally, he explained the content of his long conversation with the Spanish ambassador. Pétain was looking for a suitable secret envoy and immediately invited Franco's representative. Lequerica, accompanied by the papal envoy Valeri, met with Pétain, and both agreed to convey the intention of an armistice to the German and Italian regimes. This proposal had to be presented as an honorable proposal between soldiers.

That night, Pétain did not go to bed to sleep peacefully. He only sat down in an armchair near dawn, covering his knees with a blanket, for a few hours of rest. He had done this before when commanding the battle at Verdun, knowing that tomorrow's difficulties would be even greater after a day of difficult work, and rested in this way to recover his strength.

On June 18, Hitler and Mussolini met in Munich and decided on the terms of the armistice with France, but the German army was still advancing. While occupying Rennes in Brittany and crossing the lower Loire River, they also seized Nevers and reached the Swiss border. Three days later, they occupied Vichy and Lyon. Bordeaux had not received any reply from Berlin or Rome, and the situation was tense to the point of being unbearable.

Suddenly, it was reported that Mandel had been arrested. He was dining with the famous actress Béatrice Bretty in one of Bordeaux's most luxurious restaurants when he was suddenly arrested by the police. Mandel was arrested! Was this an attempt to seize the government by force? Was this the first demand made by the German side? In fact, Mandel had been accused by Bordeaux citizens of hiding weapons and plotting to overthrow the Pétain government, so he was detained for three hours. He then received an apology from Pétain and regained his freedom.

Like this kind of absurd rumor, there was also the rumor that Reynaud had left France for the United States. In reality, Reynaud was pacing back and forth in the lobby of the Splendide Hotel, his attitude very calm, and his self-confidence undiminished. The only member of the old government who had already left France was General de Gaulle. He was an ambitious separatist, and after predicting this great tragedy, he went to London to form the French National Committee to oppose the Pétain government.

The German response did not arrive until the 19th, requesting that France "appoint plenipotentiary ambassadors, empowered to sign an armistice treaty. After the German side agrees, it will designate the date and place for a meeting with the German plenipotentiary ambassador." The French government immediately nominated Generals Huntziger and Prételat, Admiral Le Luc, and former Ambassador to Poland Noël. They went immediately to Compiègne, to the same train car where German generals had accepted surrender terms in 1918, to determine France's fate. That night, Bordeaux was again subjected to heavy bombing by the Germans.

There were lengthy secret talks during the day about the disposition of the French fleet. British First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander, accompanied by British Ambassador to France Sir Campbell, flew to Bordeaux to consult with Pétain and Minister of the Navy Darlan and Foreign Minister Baudouin. They agreed that under no circumstances would the French fleet be handed over to Germany. Darlan also pleaded at the next cabinet meeting that the French fleet should not be used to fight against Britain and proposed that France itself disarm the ships. The entire cabinet agreed.

On June 20, the French government felt that there was no guarantee of obtaining acceptable terms from Germany, so it provisionally decided to move the government to Perpignan. The office of the Chamber of Deputies secretly chartered a ship to carry away some of the people most hated by the Germans from Bordeaux. On this ship were Daladier and his son Jean, Mandel, Campinchi, Kerillis, and a dozen members of parliament. A few days later, the ship arrived in Casablanca, North Africa. Daladier, unaccustomed to the rough seas, suffered severe seasickness. Campinchi's teeth were knocked out. When they landed, they were treated as fugitives.

On June 22, there was still no news from Compiègne, probably because the terms were too harsh. Members of the cabinet were seriously considering moving to North Africa. They firmly decided that if the conditions were too harsh, they would implement this plan. Vehicles and ships were prepared to carry a group of ministers and office staff from various ministries to Algeria.

On June 23, General Huntziger thanked the German army for setting up a telephone line in a very short time, so that he could communicate with Pétain at any time and report the German conditions. (In reality, Bordeaux had already been informed of these terms six hours earlier by Colonel Bébert, the special envoy of the Spanish Foreign Minister. The Spanish Foreign Minister's information was conveyed by the German Ambassador Stohrer). The terms, after slight modifications in detail by the French plenipotentiary ambassadors, were fully accepted. The Franco-Italian armistice agreement was also signed on the same day.

At 0:35 on June 25, the war officially ended. From the declaration of war to this point, France had fought for only two hundred and ninety-seven days, and actually fought for only forty-seven days. Now it laid down its weapons, with one-half of its territory occupied. (End)

Correction: In yesterday's newspaper, "The Great Tragedy of France – Continued," sections 1 to 5 should be placed between sections 8 and 9. The order was reversed. This is hereby corrected.

### ### Today is the Anniversary of the Birth of the Father of the Nation: Celebrations Extended by Chinese and Foreigners in Shanghai, Citywide Flag Display, Donations for Winter Clothing Funds, Withdrawal of Chinese Troops Commemoration Postponed by One Day, Normal Precautions Implemented in Both Concessions, Traffic Not Blocked

Today is the anniversary of the birth of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation. Because the situation is extraordinary, various sectors will not hold extravagant celebrations or ceremonies. However, in order to commemorate the Father of the Nation's fearless spirit and his great achievements in creating the Republic, it has been decided to uniformly display flags for one day, according to the plans agreed upon by various organizations and the authorities of the two concessions. All institutions, public organizations, and schools will be closed as usual. The consulates and embassies of various countries in the city, including the United States, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Portugal, as well as the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council, will also be closed. Financial firms and various markets for flour, food, securities, soybeans, foreign currency, cotton cloth, coal, and other industries will also be closed for one day to extend the celebrations.

Active Commemoration

Various sectors in the city have decided to implement a targeted and active approach to today's commemoration, carrying out national construction savings and donating winter clothing. Citizens can directly remit savings to designated receiving agencies tomorrow for collection and remittance, to be used as appropriate. Therefore, banks and other institutions have made arrangements for the receiving procedures today to avoid temporary congestion. It is expected that the original purpose will be achieved.

Temporary Precautions

The police authorities of the two concessions, in light of today's anniversary of the Father of the Nation's birth, have implemented temporary precautions from yesterday to prevent unexpected events within the concessions. All police stations have been ordered to increase patrols, search pedestrians and vehicles. It has been rumored that all non-essential roads, such as Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, will be closed and traffic will be blocked. A reporter inquired with the police department, and it was said that the concession authorities had no plans for such measures, but are only implementing normal temporary precautions. Also, today is the third anniversary of the withdrawal of Chinese troops to the west. Because it coincides with the Father of the Nation's birthday, the solemn commemoration has been postponed by one day.

### ### Death of Pittman: Telegram Sent to the United States Expressing Condolences, Pittman's Life Dedicated to Upholding Justice, Loud Mourning in Shanghai Upon Hearing the News

Following the death of Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the public in this city, considering Pittman as China's most loyal friend, whose life was dedicated to criticizing aggression, upholding justice, and possessed a chivalrous spirit admired by all nations, expressed deep condolences upon his passing. Relatives and friends of Pittman residing in Shanghai sent a telegram to Pittman's family in the United States expressing condolences. Various Chinese organizations also believe that although Pittman has passed away, his spirit of upholding justice has established the United States' consistent anti-aggression policy, so they also asked the Ambassador to the United States to convey their condolences.

### ### Japanese Troops Prepare to Withdraw from Xiaoshan, Heavy Losses in Zhuji and Shaoxing

According to organizations from Zhejiang Province residing in Shanghai, a telegram received yesterday from eastern Zhejiang reported that after the Chinese troops recovered Qianqing on the eastern front and Linpu on the southern front in the battles south of the Qiantang River, the Japanese troops have retreated and concealed themselves in the county seat of Xiaoshan. Recently, they have also burned their defensive works at the east gate, showing signs of abandoning the county seat of Xiaoshan, which has greatly encouraged the residents of the city, awaiting a surprise attack by the Chinese troops. Order in Zhuji and Shaoxing has been restored. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway still starts from Zhuji, but the city has suffered significant losses and the shops have not fully reopened. The suburbs of Shaoxing are also desolate, and the main street from Shuicheng Lane to Dachan Temple has become a field of rubble. About 90% of the houses near Xiguo Gate have also been burned. The city is filled with refugees, urgently awaiting relief.

### ### Foreigners Hold Solemn Ceremony to Commemorate the European Armistice, Present Wreaths to Honor Unknown Heroes, and Pray that Justice Will Ultimately Triumph Over Might

Yesterday was the anniversary of the armistice of the First World War. Looking back on the past and considering the future, one cannot help but feel endless emotions. British, American, and French residents of this city, with solemn attitudes, successively went to the Peace Memorial on the Bund to present wreaths, paying tribute to the unknown heroes of a previous generation who sacrificed their lives for justice and peace, and praying that justice will ultimately triumph over might. Although the ceremony was simple, it had great significance. Details are recorded below:

British and French Residents Jointly Present Wreaths

British and French residents of this city held a joint memorial ceremony in front of the Peace Memorial at ten o'clock. The French presented five wreaths, and the British presented a large wreath of red poppies. The British stood on the left side of the memorial, represented by British Consul-General George. In addition, participants included Commander Hemphill of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, the military attaché of the British Consulate-General, and representatives of the Great Britain Victory Society and the British Legion, totaling more than thirty people, each wearing a bright red flower on their chest, arranged in two rows. The French stood on the right side of the memorial, represented by about ten Frenchmen in military uniforms, including the French Consul-General, representatives of veterans of the war, and representatives of the French General Association and the French Municipal Council. It is said that half of these French residents were supporters of General de Gaulle of France. In a solemn atmosphere, they silently prayed. At this time, hundreds of foreigners from various countries gathered there, removing their hats and standing at attention to pay their respects. It was also reported that the French held a memorial service at St. Joseph's Church at 9:30 AM.

American Ceremony Solemn and Grand

The most impressive memorial ceremony yesterday was the one held by American residents yesterday morning at eleven o'clock. At that time, Colonel Baker, Major Hamilton, two detachments of the 4th Marine Regiment, and representatives of various American organizations in this city held a twenty-minute memorial ceremony in front of the Peace Memorial. When the color guard of the American troops raised the American flag and saluted the flag, there were many American and other people watching. Then, Colonel Baker and Major Hamilton presented a large chrysanthemum wreath in front of the statue. Following them, Mr. Matti, a giant in the American automobile industry, represented the American Legion, Mrs. Allie and Mrs. Punt represented the General Federation of Women's Clubs, and Mrs. Dunlap and Mrs. Tomlinson represented the Daughters of the American Revolution, who presented wreaths to the statue. Then, Chaplain Cullum of the 4th Marine Regiment gave a five-minute speech and prayer. Chaplain Cullum said in his speech, "We must dedicate ourselves to justice and righteousness so that these great people beneath the tomb, though dead, shall live on." The final scene of this moving ceremony was the performance of "The Star-Spangled Banner" by the bugle corps of the 4th Marine Regiment.

Thousands of People Watched

When the American troops held the memorial ceremony, thousands of people watched nearby. The police authorities of the two concessions dispatched a large number of police officers to maintain order on the spot, and placed iron nets and wooden fences on the sidewalk and around the statue across the road from the statue to prevent the audience from approaching. However, because many foreigners from various countries and American troops participated in the ceremony, the road was blocked and traffic was temporarily cut off for five minutes. After the ceremony, the wreaths sent by foreigners from various countries remained in front of the statue for viewing. People came to visit throughout the day. The Shanghai Municipal Police sent many patrolmen to guard nearby.

### ### Barbed Wire Still Erected at the Western End of Jing'an Temple Road

The Shanghai Times reported that after Corporal Saito Seiichi of the Japanese Military Police was assassinated on YuYuan Road on October 18, the Japanese authorities immediately took precautions in the Western District, causing British Shanghai Municipal Council buses to only travel to Jing'an Temple. Only single-decker buses traveled west of Jing'an Temple. This lasted for more than three weeks, until yesterday (the 10th) when double-decker buses resumed service west of Jing'an Temple and on Haig Road. At the same time, because of repeated crimes in the Western District, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department erected barbed wire obstacles at the intersections of the roads leading to Haig Road and the areas outside Jing'an Temple, and at the intersections of Great Western Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and YuYuan Road. These have not yet been removed.

### ### Christian Groups Pray for the Current Situation

The International Fellowship of Prayer and the Christian Federation, in view of the raging flames and the devastated scenes everywhere, notified churches across the country to hold a national prayer meeting yesterday, specifically praying for the current situation to avert a great disaster. Various church groups in this city held prayers for the current situation in the morning and a joint prayer meeting in the afternoon. Many Christians participated enthusiastically.

### ### Litigation Stagnation in the French Concession, Judges Almost All Resigning, Bar Association Relocated Elsewhere, Avenue Haig Presents a Desolate Scene

All Chinese courts established in the French Concession based on the agreements signed between China and France have been seized since the 8th of this month. The courts, considering that the authorities of the French Concession disregard the agreements and allow illegal intruders, were forced to withdraw. Since then, the official Chinese courts have suspended their functions. According to the orders of the National Government, any judgments claiming to be from courts in the French Concession will be considered invalid. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency inquired with various parties yesterday and compiled the news as follows:

Bar Association Relocated to Work Elsewhere

It is reported that when the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court was seized, more than 170,000 of the litigants' bail money had not been taken out and fell into the hands of the intruders. As for the Shanghai Second Special District Court, someone had been secretly watching in advance, and even a newspaper could not be taken out at will. As for the Bar Association, it had moved out of the concession beforehand. After discussions among many people, it was believed that lawyers should abide by the law, and since the legitimate courts in the French Concession have suspended their functions, they should of course stop appearing in court. Therefore, there were few vehicles on Avenue Haig yesterday.

Enforcement Office Staff All Resign

The Shanghai Second Special District Court's Civil Enforcement Office, which specializes in civil enforcement cases, had more than ten staff members. It is reported that since the day the court was seized, the judges Shu Chang and Lu Jiarui, and the clerks Ma Suquan, Xu Lujia, and Wang Duxing, have all resigned. All civil enforcement cases in the "court" are currently stalled.

Case Stagnation Difficult to Restore

The English Great American Evening News reported that most of the prosecutors and inspectors of the French Concession High Court Third Branch and the Second Special Court have refused to go to the "court" to work. Other lawyers and French Concession police lawyers have also refused to appear in court, so since last Friday (the 8th), all lawsuits that have not been decided have been stalled. It will be difficult to restore the original situation for a while. However, it is reported that some newly "appointed" staff members may take office in the next day or two. At the same time, the French Concession police continued to maintain strict precautions in front of the court buildings this morning (i.e., yesterday morning) to prevent accidents. Officials have refused to comment on the court issue, but it is reported that talks may continue today to resolve the current difficulties.

### ### Ningbo Plague Still Rampant

Recently, a plague broke out in Ningbo, causing considerable damage. A team of more than thirty people from the Central Anti-Epidemic Team arrived in Ningbo from Songyang the night before yesterday and began their work of eradicating and preventing the plague yesterday. Yesterday, sixteen people in the Class A Isolation Hospital were infected with the plague, and two more died. The remaining fourteen were also in critical condition. The Class C Isolation Hospital continued to admit four new patients, bringing the total to twelve. Among them, five have improved after treatment and will be discharged soon. Also, the Yin County Anti-Epidemic Office received a telegram from the Cixi Urban Area Anti-Epidemic Office yesterday, stating that two plague patients living on Kaiming Street had fled to Cixi and died there yesterday. The Cixi Anti-Epidemic Team buried them in the wilderness and disinfected the houses where they lived. Also, the search team of the security group continued to find two residents who had fled from the plague area yesterday and have been sent to the isolation hospital.

### US Ship Evacuation Starts Today; Kobe Port Not Berthing; Only a Few US Citizens Evacuate on This Ship; Washington Ship Expected to be Crowded

The second US evacuation ship, the "Mariposa" postal ship, entered the Wusongkou at 9:40 AM yesterday and sailed to the No. 11 and 12 buoys at around 11:00 AM to dock. The small boat for crew members to disembark arrived at the New Customs Wharf at 12:20 PM yesterday. The postal ship will stay overnight in Shanghai and is scheduled to set sail for Qinhuangdao at 9:30 AM this morning, passing through Incheon (Korea) and Honolulu, etc., on its way back to San Francisco. The shuttle boats for evacuating the Americans boarded at 9:00 PM and 12:00 AM last night from the New Customs Wharf. According to the company, only 83 tickets were sold for the evacuation of Americans in this city. The number of Americans evacuated from North China, Tianjin, and other places who are concentrated in Qinhuangdao to board the ship is unknown. Mr. Pippin, a commissioner of the Matson Company, decided to come to Shanghai by the "Monterey" postal ship to assist the United States President Lines in handling the ship ticket matters. Now that the official business is completed, he will return to the country with the "Mariposa" postal ship this morning.

Safe Journey to Shanghai

According to the English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", the second US evacuation ship "Mariposa" arrived in Shanghai at 11:30 AM today (the 11th) and is immediately preparing to set sail for North China and Korea early tomorrow morning (the 12th). The "Mariposa" weighs 19,000 tons and is luxuriously equipped. The hull is painted white and shines brightly. After arriving in Shanghai, it docked at the No. 11 and 12 buoys. A group of personnel from the United States President Lines boarded the ship to take care of it. Each side of the ship and the stern are painted with huge American flags. It is said that this flag was painted since the outbreak of the European War, not added because it was sailing to the Far East. According to Captain Meyer told reporters that the ship sailed from Honolulu and had a safe journey. It only encountered bad weather east of the Ogasawara Islands for three days. However, this is not unusual, because ships often encounter bad weather when passing east of the island.

Kobe Port Definitely Not Berthing

The "Mariposa" did not carry a single passenger upon arriving here. During the journey to Shanghai, the crew had pastimes such as a movie room and a swimming pool. The entire ship can accommodate 725 passengers, and some hammocks have been added to prevent the number of passengers from exceeding the limit. When in Honolulu, supplies have been replenished to prepare for "any development". However, according to the United States President Lines, the number of passengers on the "Mariposa" will not be too crowded. There are currently 85 Americans in Shanghai who will depart on this ship, and less than 500 in Qinhuangdao and Incheon, Korea. It was also announced that the "Mariposa" will definitely not berth in Kobe, Japan. However, the destination of the ship after leaving Incheon has not been disclosed. When the "Mariposa" docked, the crew rushed ashore to sightsee, including Captain Meyer. It is said that he has not been to Shanghai for 18 years, and his appearance must have changed greatly. The "Mariposa" once sailed along the Chinese coast eight or nine years ago, but this is the first time it has come to Shanghai.

Comfortable Cabins and Exquisite Cuisine

The "Mariposa" was built in 1932 and is a sister ship to the "Monterey" and "Manulani". It weighs 18,017 tons and travels at a speed of 20 nautical miles per hour. For the past seven years, it has been traveling between San Francisco and Melbourne. The entire ship is painted white and is one of the most beautiful ships on the water. Its comfortable cabins and exquisite cuisine are well-known throughout the world.

Washington Ship's Voyage to Shanghai

The third evacuation ship, the "Washington", is scheduled to arrive in port on the 17th of this month. The ship is huge and can accommodate more than 1,500 passengers. It has a large number of third-class cabins and extra small beds, and the ticket price is only about 100 US dollars. Therefore, the number of people reserving cabins on the ship from the United States President Lines has been constant in recent days. According to a reporter from the New Life News Agency, more than 400 people will be leaving Shanghai on this ship. The ship will stay here for four days and is scheduled to set sail for the United States on the 21st. According to the US registration, there are more than 4,000 people to be evacuated. As of today, 1,000 people have left Shanghai, and another 1,000 people have decided to evacuate within the year, who will take the various ships of the United States President Lines.

### Jinshanwei Guerrilla Fights with Japanese Troops; Villagers Wounded by Bullets; Family Sends to Shanghai for Medical Treatment

Tang Kaiming, a native of Songjiang, is 21 years old and lives in a certain building in Zhujing Shuiputang East, Jinshanwei. A few days ago (the 5th), there was a guerrilla fight with the Japanese army in that area. Both sides opened fire. Tang Kaiming happened to be passing by and was wounded in the left arm by a stray bullet. Later, because traffic in that area was blocked, he could not seek medical treatment. It was not until the day before yesterday that his family managed to escort him to Shanghai. He arrived in Shanghai at around 8:00 PM last night and was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment.

### Hong Kong Establishes Immigration Bureau; Travelers Fear Restrictions; Rush to Take Ships

It is rumored that the Hong Kong government, in view of the overpopulation of the local area, wants to restrict travelers from going there and has decided to set up an immigration bureau on the first of next month to handle immigration entry procedures and implement restrictions on travelers to Hong Kong. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency recently inquired about this with travel agencies. Travelers from this port who want to go to Hong Kong are afraid that the procedures will inevitably be more complicated after the Hong Kong government announces these restrictions, so many are going to Hong Kong in advance. Therefore, recently, many travelers have been buying tickets to Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government has now notified the local travel industry that anyone traveling from Shanghai to Hong Kong, regardless of class, must hold a Municipal Council smallpox certificate and an epidemic prevention certificate issued six days before leaving Shanghai, and the certificate must be affixed with a two-and-a-half-inch photo of the person to be valid. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to disembark. It is heard that the British Jardine Matheson Shipping Company's ships to Hong Kong, the "Mingsheng" scheduled for tomorrow and the "Yusheng" scheduled for the 16th of this month, will be more popular with passengers than before.

### Cargo to Southwest China Transported Via Shayuchong

Since the Shayuchong line in Hong Kong was opened, many commercial goods transported from this port to various parts of Southwest China have been routed through this line and imported through Shaoguan, which is very convenient. Recently, cargo transportation between Shanghai and Hong Kong has become increasingly crowded. The Qiacheng Shipping Company on Avenue Joffre has rented the American Qiapao "Pluto" ship to join the route, specializing in carrying goods, with a load of more than 5,000 tons. It is scheduled to set sail from Shanghai on the 14th. Recently, several batches of local products from Southwest China will be exported from Hong Kong via Shayuchong and loaded onto ships for transportation to Shanghai. The company's joint transportation arrangement is about to be completed.

### Municipal Council Concert

The Municipal Council Music Team is scheduled to hold its sixth symphony concert at the Lyceum Theatre at 5:15 PM this Sunday. The program includes three items.

### Local Observer Talks About Soviet Union Maintaining Neutrality and Deciding Not to Be Enemy of the British and American Front; Soviet Foreign Minister's Visit to Germany Influences Small Countries

Regarding the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Germany, a local observer said that the Soviet Union maintains traditional interests in the Balkans and the Near East, and the Black Sea and the Dardanelles are the keys to the southern gate of Soviet Russia. The flames of Western Europe are gradually moving eastward, which has made the Soviet Union feel uneasy. Molotov's visit to Berlin is aimed at discussing with Germany the division of the sphere of influence in Eastern Europe in order to protect the interests of the Soviet Union by means of compromise. This trip has a major relationship with the future status of the Near East countries, especially Turkey. The Soviet Union will not abandon its policy of peace and neutrality for the time being, and will not join the Axis powers to jointly deal with the British and American front. However, if the Soviet-German negotiations are coordinated, it will affect the attitude of the small countries in Eastern Europe. It is indeed a difficult task for Britain to deal with Germany and Italy alone in the Balkans.

### Rice Prices Dominated by Rumors; Fierce Price Increase Yesterday; Authorities Unable to Control and Closed the Market Early; Responsible Parties Should Not Turn a Blind Eye

The rice market has been active in recent days due to investment molecules, resulting in an increase in the price per stone. Yesterday, it continued to rise by about two yuan. The price of rice in the past four days has risen by as much as six yuan per stone. The Market Management Committee was unable to control it and finally closed the market early at 11:00 AM. If measures are not taken to suppress it urgently, the price increase will develop into the unrestricted price increase of last month.

Obvious Crimes

Since the source of domestic rice in this city has been slightly restricted, foreign rice has been ordered from overseas producing areas, resulting in the rise and fall of the selling price in this city, which depends on the quantity of foreign rice. Since the situation in Vietnam changed, speculators have taken advantage of various reasons to raise rice prices. However, the source of foreign rice has not only not been blocked, but is very abundant. The goods arriving in the past two weeks have been more than 400,000 bags, and the inventory is very sufficient. Some transportation merchants, taking advantage of the opportunity of the decline in gold prices and the long exchange rate, have ordered from the producing areas, also in the amount of hundreds of thousands of bags. Furthermore, after the Shanghai Citizens Food Regulation Association promoted group ordering, all sectors responded and participated. Therefore, the future of food for the citizens of this city is very optimistic, and there is no danger of shortage. Now, due to the manipulation of speculators and the hoarding of households, who refuse to let go, the rice market, which was slightly stable, has become tense again due to the price increase. The crime of stirring up trouble should be forcibly suppressed by the concession authorities, and should not be ignored.

Taking the Opportunity to Spread Rumors

Recently, speculators have been spreading rumors in the market, saying that if the Japanese army's southward policy is successful one day, it will be difficult to purchase rice in the future. Some firms have rushed to absorb a large amount of rice, resulting in falling into the trap of speculators, giving them the opportunity to hoard and raise prices, making the entire rice market chaotic. Although the Japanese army has the intention of advancing south, there is currently no impediment to the transportation of foreign rice to Shanghai. Because the Nanyang area produces three crops a year, if this huge amount of production is not sold to foreign markets, the entire economy of the country will be greatly affected. And now the shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam is smooth, and the transportation of foreign rice is also more convenient than before. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason for the continuous rise in prices. It is heard that the Rice and Grain Evaluation Association is deeply afraid of exceeding the 5% profit stipulated by the authorities, which will disrupt the rice market. Therefore, they have been exchanging opinions for several days and plan to convene a meeting immediately to discuss suppression methods. The authorities are also paying close attention to this and will jointly suppress the rice price with the rice industry groups when necessary.

Group Purchase Should Be Expedited

Regarding the citizens' initiative to organize group purchases of foreign rice, the authorities have repeatedly advocated it, and reporters have also repeatedly stated that the citizens' automatic purchase of rice is related to the future of the entire food supply in Shanghai. Although many parties have already launched the initiative, most are still watching and waiting, missing the good opportunity. Now the price of rice is frequently increasing, and the livelihood of the common people will inevitably suffer a serious blow. However, the rice merchants' excuses are ultimately that the rice reserves are not abundant, and the domestic and foreign sources are not abundant, so people's minds are firm and rice prices have rebounded to a peak. The relevant parties hope that all sectors will quickly initiate or participate in group purchases of foreign rice, and no longer miss the good opportunity, jointly seek to stabilize the entire food supply in Shanghai, and relieve the suffering of the common people. The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association's first group purchase of rice, with the price tentatively set at 75 yuan per bag, has already begun.

### Tonghe Debt Problem Resolved; Settlement Plan Signed

The debt problem of the commercial department of Tonghe Commercial Savings Bank was resolved by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce convening the third conciliation of all creditors the day before yesterday. As a result, a settlement was reached.

### Former Site of Central Bank; Leased by Municipal Council; Although Lease Has Been Terminated, It Has Not Been Returned to the Owner; Central Bank Has No Expression Since Being Occupied

The former site of the Central Bank at the corner of Jiujiang Road and the Bund was leased by the Municipal Council to open a school after the war because the head office of the Central Bank moved inland and the Shanghai branch moved to Yiyuan to work. The Municipal Council's Nie Zhongcheng School, etc., have moved to Daxilu for classes. Although the former site of the Central Bank was declared to be vacated three months ago in accordance with the lease agreement, it has been "occupied" before the site was returned to the owner. It is heard that the Central Bank has no expression even though the site has been occupied because the former site was leased by the Municipal Council and has not been returned to the owner.

### Bullets Flying on Chongqing Road; Police Bravely Chase Thieves; Chinese Police Wounded but Still Pursue; Result: One Thief Killed and One Pedestrian Wounded; Yuanfengchang Rice Shop Looted by Bandits Yesterday

A major robbery occurred in broad daylight at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Rue Pellerin in the French Concession yesterday afternoon. There was a great fight between bandits and police. When the police chased to Dagu Road, one thief was shot and killed on the spot. One policeman was also injured. The details are compiled as follows:

Rice Shop Employees Settling Accounts at Noon

The second floor of the Shengtaichang Leather Goods and Tailor Shop at No. 7 Avenue Foch and Rue Pellerin in the French Concession is rented to Wang Baochu from Luodian. His family lives in the pavilion room, and the entire building is used as the Yuanfengchang Rice Shop, employing accountants, runners, etc. Wang Baochu himself usually goes to the Qingliange Rice Market on Simalu every morning to buy and sell. At 12:05 PM yesterday, employee Liu Senlin and two others returned from the market first. Before long, Wang also returned home in his own chartered car for lunch. At that time, the employees were busy settling their accounts, totaling more than 1,800 yuan in cash and a check for 700 yuan in national currency. Part of the money was placed on the table, and a small amount remained in their pockets.

Seven Bandits Armed and Entered

When the carter A Er (from Jiangbei) parked the car, he carried a sample bag and entered the kitchen to eat. Unexpectedly, seven bandits followed behind, each holding a pistol. Three were stationed in the shop of Shengtaichang Leather Shop on the lower floor, one guarded the side of the handrail, one pointed a gun at the hostess and maid in the kitchen, forbidding them to make a sound, and the remaining two bandits forced the carter A Yi to lead them upstairs, directly into the accounting room in the front building, pulled out guns, and one of them spoke in a Jiangbei accent, saying, "Boss Wang, we have been waiting for a long time. Please help us today." They first put all the cash on the table into their pockets, and then washed away all the accounts from the employees.

Carter Escapes and Reports to the Police

At that time, the carter saw that the two bandits were busy looting, so he took the opportunity to escape, opened the sunning platform door, turned over and entered the sunning platform of a coal ball shop at No. 9, and ran out through the back door, secretly reporting to Zhu Denglu, a police officer of the Daodeli police station, and telegraphed to the Songshan Road police station. Because it was close by, armed Chinese and Western detectives were immediately dispatched and drove in police cars. However, the thieves had already left with the stolen goods.

Chinese Police Shot; Injured and Pursued Tightly

The bandits fled westward along Avenue Foch without a trace. One bandit was about to escape from the main entrance and turned into Rue Luzon. The employees shouted "Robber" at the window, and a Vietnamese police officer at No. 198 at the corner of the Yimiao Street drew his gun when he heard the alarm. The bandit, in order to strike first, raised his pistol and aimed at the police officer. The police officer quickly dodged. The bandit did not have time to fire and fled northward. The Vietnamese police officer also followed closely. Both sides opened fire several times along Rue Edouard VII, but none of them hit. At the intersection of Chongqing Road, the Chinese police officer No. 3349 of the Chengdu Road police station, who was directing traffic, saw the bandit running over and planned to arrest him. The bandit immediately fired a shot at the police officer, hitting the police officer in the lower abdomen. The bullet did not penetrate. Although the police officer was shot and injured, he still bravely joined the Vietnamese police officer No. 198 and pursued closely. When the bandit ran north through Chongqing Road and turned east into Dagu Road,

Gunfire Flying; One Thief Shot Dead

The Chinese and Vietnamese police officers who followed fired five shots at him, and the bandit also returned fire to resist arrest. The sound of gunfire was like throwing a firecracker. On the spot, a stray bullet wounded a pedestrian, Song Xie (30 years old), in the right foot. The Chinese police officer No. 3349 who was chasing ran to No. 214 Wu Lao Jian Tou Shop on Dagu Road, was shot and injured, and collapsed. Fresh blood flowed out. The bandit fled to the front of No. 187 Tai Ji Cigarette Paper Shop on the west side of the Xinmalis Vegetable Market, and also fell to the ground after being shot. One shot hit the chest and one hit the leg. The injuries were too serious and he died on the spot. The bandit wore a dark camel wool robe, a black long gown on the outside, a blue cloth shirt and pants, yellow socks, and black running shoes. He was 25 or 26 years old. Half an hour after his death, his body was transported to the autopsy site in a hearse. The injured Chinese police officer No. 3349 was sent to the Municipal Council Hospital for treatment by ambulance. It is said that the bullet hit a vital point and his life was in danger. The injured woman was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment.

### Robbery at Zhonghui Building; Two Thieves Arrested

The Zhonghui Building at No. 420 Avenue Edouard VII in the French Concession is the residence of Tang Hesheng. At about 4:00 PM yesterday, four bandits suddenly broke in and robbed 370 yuan in French currency. When the bandits were committing the robbery, the French police station received a report and sent a large number of detectives to the scene, surrounding the Zhonghui Building on all sides. After a while, the bandits were called to carry the stolen goods out. The detectives immediately stepped forward to arrest them, but the four thieves saw a large number of detectives and fled. The police chased closely to the vicinity of Mugia Circle in the Public Concession and arrested two thieves, seized a pistol, six bullets, and part of the stolen money, and took them to the police station for handling.

Foreign Apartment; Bandits Rob Gun

At 1:30 PM yesterday, two bandits broke into Apartment No. 28, No. 182 Rue Amiral Bayle and Rue Magy in the French Concession to commit a robbery. At that time, the American Li Lai (the slot machine king), who lived in that apartment, was out, and only one servant was inside. The bandits immediately took out guns to threaten him and robbed a gold watch, a personal pistol, six bullets, worth more than 1,000 yuan, and left with the stolen goods.

### British Overseas Nationals Association; Lottery Drawn Last Night

### Collection of Crimes; Taking a Cut and Gambling

Room No. 202 of the Meilongzhen Hotel at No. 5 Lane 6 Pingwang Street has recently been used to open a gambling den and profit from taking a cut. This was discovered by Zhou Zhenxing, a Chinese detective from the Old Gate Police Station, who went to arrest them at 11:30 PM last night. He arrested the boss Cao Xihou, gambler Lin Guoqing and 18 others, and seized a domino, gambling oceans, etc. Yesterday morning, he sent them to the First Special Court. The police station's lawyers Qian Xunjiu and Peng Qixin requested strict punishment in accordance with the law. After questioning by Judge Zhan Gence, Cao was sentenced to three months in prison, and the others were each fined 10 yuan. The gambling equipment was confiscated.

Private Possession of Military Weapons

The Public Security Force Reserve Team searched pedestrians at the intersection of Fujian Road and Beijing Road at 7:15 AM on the 9th and seized a box gun and three bullets from Yang Shenggen, a native of Wuxi. He was taken to the Old Gate Police Station, investigated by Chinese detective Xue Youwen, and sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police station's lawyer Ru Baoyi requested to detain him for investigation. Judge Feng sentenced Yang to detention and scheduled another hearing.

Selling Opium

Zhang Zhitong, an opium trafficker from Wuxi, had a room at No. 238 of the Dadong Hotel at No. 6 Nanjing Road. On the 3rd of this month, Zhang obtained 16 and a half pounds of opium worth a lot of money and asked Ge Fengming from Wuxi to carry it with him, intending to send it to Suzhou River and take a boat to Wuxi. He was arrested at the entrance of the Wing On Company. Later, Hu Jilin, Zhang Zeshan, Ding Shun'an, Zhou Yi, and four others were arrested in Room No. 238 of the Dadong Hotel. Zhang was at large. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu rose to continue the interrogation. The defendants hired Wang Yaotang as their lawyer to defend them. Ge Fengming was sentenced to six months in prison for knowingly possessing opium. If he could commute the sentence to a fine, it would be three yuan per day. The remaining four people, Hu Jilin, etc., were each fined 100 yuan. The 139 taels, 4 mace, and 8 fen of opium were confiscated.

### Case of Thugs Intercepted on Avenue Dubail: Investigation Reveals Foiled Kidnapping Attempt; Three Thugs All From Fujian, Equipped with Military Caps and Bayonets; Second Attempt to Abduct Kong Xianfen Fails

At 9:10 AM on the 9th of this month, a black-plated car, license number 5579, carrying three Taiwanese and two Chinese individuals, drove along Avenue Dubail at the intersection of Rue Tenant de la Tour. They were suddenly met by a search team from the Public Police, who approached to investigate. One of the Chinese men abruptly jumped out of the car, pulled out a pistol, and fled, leading to him being shot dead by Chinese and Western officers. Stray bullets injured several people. The remaining three Taiwanese and one Chinese individual, along with the car, were taken to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Details of the incident have already been reported. Further investigation by the police revealed that the so-called three Taiwanese were not from Taiwan but were actually Chinese from Fujian.

Knowing of Modest Wealth, Planning a Kidnapping

It was learned through interrogation that their names were Chen Jiabao, Lin Yueyan, and Jiang Jianben. The arrested Chinese man was named Gao Jinsheng, from Shaoxing, and the deceased was Chen Jinbiao, 22 years old, from Tongzhou, a well-known rogue in the Suzhou area. It was determined that they intended to kidnap Kong Xianfen. Kong worked at the National Goods Bank on Avenue Foch and lived at No. 6, Lane 75, on Rue Murmel. His movements were observed, and he always took a chartered car. Lu Ahua, who lived at No. 2, Lane 75, and Yang Qingshan (also known as A Qiao), a Henan man who sold fruit in the lane, learned that the Kong family was of modest means and conspired to provide information. Together with Gao Jinsheng, Chen Jinbiao, and others, they planned to kidnap Kong for ransom.

First Kidnapping Fails, Second Attempt

Using the fact that Chen Jiabao and the other two resembled Japanese, they wore military caps and impersonated Japanese soldiers. On August 21st of this year, when Kong Xianfen's chartered car left the lane, they attempted to kidnap him. However, Kong was alert, got out of the car, and fled. He encountered an Indian policeman on the way and shouted for help, managing to escape. The thugs drove away. This time, they discussed the matter again in room 22 of the Xi'an Hotel on Xi'an Road, planning to kidnap Kong again. Yang Qingshan was responsible for keeping watch. If he saw Kong leaving, he would signal by removing his hat. They rented car number 5579 from the Xinxing Automobile Company, owned by a Japanese person, at No. 170, Wusong Road, Hongkou.

Subject Alert, Fortunate Escape

Learning from the previous failed attempt, Kong was very cautious. Whenever he went out, he would get out of the car and walk, paying extra attention. When Kong walked out of the lane entrance the previous morning, he saw a suspicious car opposite him and turned around, heading north. Yang Qingshan, realizing the plan had failed, informed the thugs. They drove back towards Hongkou but were caught in a search at the intersection of Avenue Dubail, leading to the shooting incident. In addition to a pistol and four bullets found on the deceased Chen Jinbiao, a pistol and seven bullets were found near Chen Jiabao, and a military bayonet and two military caps were found near Jiang Jianben. Yang Qingshan was subsequently arrested, while Lu Ahua remains at large. Yesterday morning, the police transferred Gao, Chen, Lin, Jiang, and Yang to the Second Criminal Court of the Special First District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the above circumstances, requesting a postponement. Judge Fu ordered the five defendants to be detained, with a new hearing scheduled for the 22nd.

Strength of Both Teams

Today, Donghua and Lux are the two most elite iron armies in this season's A-League. Donghua defeated Jewish, conquered Western Police, defeated St. Francis, broke North Western Children's Home, and overwhelmingly won against the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce. With the convergence of wind and clouds, its prestige spread far and wide, becoming the only remaining Chinese iron chariot. Lux was originally a strong team, further strengthened by the heroes of St. Francis, North Western Children's Home, and the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce, effectively becoming a disguised Western United team. Therefore, today's Donghua-Lux battle is no less than a gathering of a Chinese team against a Western United team, with equal strength. It is yet unknown who will emerge victorious. On the Donghua side, the initial plan was to try its new formation, with Jia Youliang and Hong as forwards to strengthen the midfield line. Fei Chunhua and Sun Lufang were to be assigned to take charge of the main formation, but due to the strength of the Lux army, it was decided to use the same lineup as in the previous day's battle against the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce.

Precautions

Today, spectators who purchased tickets in advance, both five-yuan and two-yuan tickets, must enter through the Avenue Joffre gate. One-yuan tickets can be entered through the Rue West Adams entrance. Temporary ticket sales will be available at the respective counters mentioned above. However, in accordance with the regulations of the French Municipal Council, a donation tax of 10% must be collected on tickets: five-yuan tickets require five yuan five jiao, two-yuan tickets require two yuan two jiao, and one-yuan tickets require one yuan one jiao. Spectators must prepare sufficient small denominations to purchase tickets, as we regret that we cannot provide change. Western Football Club gift tickets will not be valid today. However, those who enter the stadium must still present the pale yellow special pass issued by the club.

Food

### Rice Weevils Unabated, Food Difficult to Obtain; Hoarding Merchants Are Powerful and Wealthy... Appeals Fall on Deaf Ears; Foreign Rice Arrives in Steady Streams... Rice Prices Rise Daily, Several Yuan per Day... Poor People Will Soon Be Driven to the Gutters

The rise in rice prices in recent days is truly extraordinary. The existing stock does not decrease, and arrivals occur daily, but rice prices are recklessly raised. Various rumors have been repeatedly disproven with facts. However, facts remain facts, and rumors continue to spread. The manipulation of hoarding merchants still exerts its maximum power, all for the sake of other commodities, not "food items." Even for cloth, which is a "food item," it is ultimately not as crucial as genuine "food item"—rice. Because a piece of clothing can be worn for several years and can be mended when torn, even though cloth is as expensive as pre-war silk, it is still not as vital as rice, which is indispensable for daily survival and can be said to be controlled "in one's hands every day." Once it enters the stomach, hunger burns, and within a few hours, the stomach rumbles again, requiring new fuel in the form of porridge and rice. Therefore, the recent influx of capital is not being used in legitimate industry and commerce but in rice, which is essential for public survival. It is truly a case of borrowing a knife to kill, unafraid of bloodshed, seeking only personal enjoyment and disregarding the suffering of the masses. Now, look at the general rice merchants, all with high spirits, fat heads, and big brains, smoking cigars, drinking fine wine, and rejoicing at home. However, many are frowning and complaining about this, unable to eat their fill, drinking soup, and still unable to cope. The rice market has reached this point, partly because of inconsistent principles, but also because of speculative hoarding merchants seeking unattainable gains. The so-called "rule," "wartime," and "famine" cause others to grieve, while rice merchants and hoarding merchants are delighted. Without these situations, hoarding merchants cannot manipulate, spread rumors, or profit from troubled waters. Moreover, such rice prices cannot be achieved without wealth and power. When discussing price stabilization, appeals are met with deaf ears and no effect. Black-hearted rice merchants are still crying about losses. This so-called loss must be based on the rice price having once reached over eighty yuan, believing that it must return to that level. However, it is not known that Saigon No. 1 has already reached seventy-one yuan, and new japonica rice in its original bag has reached a high price of ninety-one yuan. In this case, according to the psychology of rice merchants, rice prices will inevitably rise daily in the future. I also think it will be a loss. Is there any reason for this? In short, if rice weevils are not eliminated, the people will continue to face difficulties in obtaining food.

The actions of hoarding merchants are so ruthless. However, looking at foreign rice, it continues to arrive daily without fail. The Taikoo Company's Suiyang wheel, carrying 5,456 bags from Hong Kong, arrived last Saturday evening and docked at its own pier in Pudong for unloading. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson had two ships arriving in Shanghai, transporting foreign rice from Hong Kong. The Mingsheng wheel carried 3,285 bags, and the Sun Transporter carried 200 bags. However, the original ship will transport 1,340 bags of foreign rice to Qingdao today.

Yesterday, the price of foreign rice in the market soared, with each grade rising consistently. No. 1 West was at 72 yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, it still tried to rally and refused to sell. Rumors spread in the market, and people were confused. Hoarding merchants used floating capital to absorb rice, causing the market price to rise higher and higher. Spot No. 1 Yinghua Si has been quoted at 80 yuan, December No. 1 at 78.5 yuan, and No. 2 at 76 yuan to 75.5 yuan, and they are not willing to sell as much as possible. Even borrowing the occupation of a building on the Bund, and being confused by rumors about legal tender, and then encountering the contraction of exchange rates and rising gold prices, the price was set higher, which is no less than adding fuel to the fire, raising eyebrows and boosting the spirits of the hoarding merchants. Therefore, the early market opening price rose steadily. Now foreign rice has risen by nearly two yuan in the morning and nearly one yuan more in the afternoon. No. 2 West was quoted at 68.7 yuan in the afternoon, which is nearly three yuan higher than on Saturday. The daily transaction was more than 7,000 bags due to the facilitation of hoarding merchants.

The arrival of new japonica rice, premium rice, and wild tea rice is still not strong, with only one or two thousand bags in total. The retail and wholesale market is still desolate. Therefore, the owners rallied and each price continued to rise by one or two yuan. The original bag of new japonica rice was quoted at 91 yuan, 89 yuan, and 86 yuan in bulk. The green rice was 82 yuan and 80 yuan, the wild rice in the middle pass was 86.5 yuan, the original bag of Dujian was 79 yuan, and the bulk was 76.5 yuan and 75 yuan. The sheep rice was in short supply.

The stocks of both domestic and foreign glutinous rice are thinner than other goods, and suddenly there are large households absorbing them, as well as active sales of wine households and rice porters, which have suddenly become scarce goods, and the price has risen sharply by more than two yuan. Yili white is 80 yuan, Hong Kong ordinary white is 76 yuan, and Decision is 73 yuan. Glutinous tea is 65 yuan, and the price of glutinous tea accompanied by a decision is up to 62 yuan.

The rice market is closed today for Sun Yat-sen's birthday to celebrate.

### Flour and Noodle Hoarding Resumes

The current flour market is gradually improving. The price of No. 2 flour factory is still 17 yuan, and the customer price is 18.5 yuan. In addition to nearly 10,000 bags of retail transactions in this street, customer sales are still not strong. However, hoarding households in this street, in view of the rising price of gold and rice, have resumed their speculative thoughts. Therefore, the old car flour price for returned goods is 19.2 yuan, and 300 bags have been collected from this street. Due to the lack of chips, it is difficult to buy more. It is also heard that the quoted price of foreign flour is also high, but because 600 bags of scheduled flour were loaded on the Taikoo Company's Suiyang wheel from Hong Kong last Saturday, both local and foreign customers are reluctant to buy. The market is still in a firm rejection.

Wheat transactions are also in a rejection situation. Since the arrival of goods from various places has been scarce, except for goods directly delivered to factories, there has been no formal sale. It is heard that the price of goods in the concession market is 27 yuan. Local merchants have purchased slightly, but the amount is not large. The Japanese factory is still collecting more than 200 bags at the original price. The market is in a dilemma for a while.

Coarse Grains

### Soybean Hoarding Merchants Active

Yesterday, soybeans suddenly became prosperous in a tired state. The market price rose by 80 jiao to 1 yuan compared to last Saturday. The reason is that the rumors are fierce and the environment is good. In a short period of time, transactions have developed. No matter whether they are Hong Kong or local hoarding households, they have suddenly become active. A total of 1,500 to 1,600 bags of Qingdao soybeans were traded in the city, at a price of 35 yuan to 35.25 yuan. There were also 500 bags of Chen soybeans, at a price of 34.2 yuan. More than 2,000 bags of Tianjin soybeans, at a price of 37.5 yuan to 36.5 yuan. More than 100 bags of Anqing soybeans, at a price of 35.35 yuan. 60 bags of Pudong Xin Du soybeans, at a price of 38 yuan. More than 1,000 bags of Chongming sand yellow new soybeans, at a price of 33.5 yuan. 750 bags of beans were shipped to Hong Kong on the 12th.

Oilcakes and Oils

### Oil Price Soars by Two Dollars

Yesterday, the oil market experienced dramatic fluctuations in exchange rates, a surge in gold prices, and the spread of rumors, creating a favorable environment. Widespread buying activity led to continuous price increases, reversing the sluggishness of the previous weekend. Peanut oil prices uniformly rose by two dollars. A total of 400 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded, priced at $73.75 to $75. Over 100 pieces were forward-dated, priced at $75.50. 300 barrels of Qingdao oil were traded, priced at $102.50 to $103.50. 500 barrels for November delivery were forward-dated, priced at $102 to $103.25.

The soybean oil market was also affected, with prices stabilizing. 100 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded, priced at $76. 50 pieces of Yanqi oil were traded, priced at $78.50, and 50 loads of Dayou Factory oil were traded, priced at $84.75. 300 pieces of tung oil arrived from Wenzhou.

Finance

### Foreign Exchange Speculation Stirs Again

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC posting rates at 9:30 AM, with British and American exchange rates tightening by 1.25 points each. The British gold rate was $3.6875, and the American exchange rate was $5.75. Other currencies such as Dutch, French, and Japanese also showed a uniform decrease. In the domestic market, there was a sudden tightening, mainly due to the absence of negative news, which led to speculative activity. The import demand in this area remained high, with foreign firms frequently settling accounts, and the general public following the trend to purchase, resulting in a tightening not seen in weeks. The afternoon closing price for the American exchange rate was $5.84375, while the evening result was $5.78125. Sterling fell to $3.703125, which was the closing price on Saturday, with British and American rates softening by $0.140625 and $0.328125, respectively.

Market Suddenly Tightens After Opening

Initially, the exchange rates between British and American currencies in Shanghai were flat, and there were no changes in the rates between American and British currencies. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of $3.84375 for British gold and $6 for the American exchange rate, which was flat for British and $0.03125 tighter for American compared to the previous Saturday's market closing. The market suddenly changed after opening, and a buying spree began soon after. Foreign firms first and Chinese firms then paid $5.9375 for American exchange for next month, and HSBC absorbed foreign banks' British gold at $3.8125 for this month. In less than half an hour, the tightening became more severe. Japanese banks bought British and sold American, purchasing spot sterling from American banks at $3.75 while selling spot American exchange to those banks at $5.84375, with the exchange rate remaining at 3.75. At 9:30, HSBC announced its rates, with both British and American exchange rates decreasing by 1.25 points. The British exchange rate was revised to $3.6875, and the American exchange rate was posted at $5.75. Other exchange rates, such as Dutch, French, and Japanese, uniformly tightened. Unexpectedly, speculators then followed the trend and bought aggressively, and short positions rushed to cover, leading to remarkably high prices. Some Chinese merchants sold this month's American exchange to foreign banks for $5.78125 and $5.84375. At noon, HSBC released foreign banks' spot American currency at $5.84375 as well. The situation stabilized before closing, with fewer buyers. The final spot prices were $3.6875 for British gold and $5.84375 for the American exchange rate, decreasing by $0.15625 each compared to the morning opening.

American Exchange Rate Re-enters the $6 Territory

The market continued to tighten afterwards. Hong Kong telecommunications speculators bought aggressively, with Hong Kong telecommunications buying foreign banks' spot American currency at $5.8125, and speculators buying this month's American currency at $5.788125. The evening closing prices showed spot sterling softening to $3.703125, with spot and this month's British gold tightening by $0.140625 compared to the end of the previous week, and next month softening by $0.15625. Spot and this month's American exchange rate decreased by $0.328125, while next month tightened by $0.296875.

British and American Rates in Tianjin Both Decrease

Tianjin, 11th (Monday) dispatch: The exchange market opened this morning with easing rates. The telegraphic transfer rates for London and New York both softened by $0.03125, with London at $3.84375 and New York at $6.03125. The Shanghai exchange rate decreased by $0.375 to $0.90. "Joint currency" traded at a discount of $0.25, at $0.85.

### Short Covering Leads to Rally, Gold Rush Resumes, High Reaching $5,800

Yesterday's black market for pure gold suddenly experienced a shocking surge, with the upward trend expanding rapidly. Amid the chaos, the price soared past the $5,600 and $5,700 levels, once even rising to the $5,800 mark, marking the largest increase since cash futures trading began. Reports that Soviet envoy Feder stated the "New Central Bank" would soon open further fueled the rumors. The dramatic tightening of foreign exchange rates stirred emotions across the board. The market initially surged by hundreds of dollars in a buying frenzy, reaching $5,690. Sellers attempted to resist, retreating to $5,655, but the foreign exchange rate continued to tighten, and exchange dealers and banks continued to pour in, causing short sellers to rush to cover, intensifying the upward trend. The price soared to the $5,800 mark. Around noon, a certain rumor arose, and the American exchange rate rebounded, causing a $60 drop. In the afternoon, the American dollar tightened again, and gold firms returned to buying, pushing the price near $5,800. However, the price dropped $65 due to money shops selling short and silver firms releasing gold. Ultimately, because of the upward sentiment, the closing price was $5,770, a sharp increase of $201. Over 6,000 taels were traded throughout the day. After closing, the price rose again to $5,790. Cash trading had not yet opened, and the price was slightly lower than futures trading by a few dollars. Decorative gold also increased by $20, reaching $590. Customs gold remained flat. The market is closed today for the birthday of the President.

Pure Gold Jumps $200

Initially, the foreign exchange market tightened, causing confusion at the opening. The price was raised to $5,690, an increase of over $120 compared to the closing price on the previous Saturday. At that time, bullish gold firms took the opportunity to lock in profits, and the price fell back by tens of dollars. Silver firms traded 20 taels at $5,655. Afterwards, as the foreign exchange rate continued to soften, sellers hesitated. Soon, silver firms traded 30 taels with money changers, exceeding the $700 mark, reaching $5,710. However, sales between gold firms pushed the price back down to within the $5,700 level. However, the tight foreign exchange market made it easy for prices to rise but difficult to fall. Silver and gold firms traded 20 taels, suddenly rising to $5,745. Although the downward trend was thwarted by silver firms releasing gold, the futures retail investors and other new longs rushed to buy, causing the price to jump to a high of $5,800. This was the case when gold firms released 20 taels to silver firms. Around noon, the foreign exchange rate eased slightly, and money changers released, while gold firms continued to sell. The noon closing price was $5,740. In the afternoon, gold firms entered silver firms with 10 taels at $5,760, and another 20 taels at $5,775. Meanwhile, silver firms released 20 taels to gold firms, falling slightly to $5,755. After fluctuating for a while, the foreign exchange market continued to tighten, and gold firms turned to buying again, reaching as high as $5,795. Finally, the money changers shorted, and the bullish silver firms released, dropping to $5,770. However, the money changers searched again in the evening, and the result was $5,770, an increase of $201 compared to the closing price on the previous Saturday. There was a fluctuation of $145 throughout the day. The current market price for cash gold from the cash firms was over $10 higher than pure gold, with purchase price lower by $30. The current standard gold was listed at $50 to $60 lower than listed gold, and trading was light.

Decorative Gold Also Increases by Two Grades

The exchange price for jewelry gold from silver firms increased by $10 at 9:30 AM, and another $10 at 11:30 AM, after which it remained unchanged. The Dadaong firm listed at $590. The new firms had similar prices, with purchase price approximately $30 lower.

### All Foreign Currencies Rise

Yesterday's market conditions for various currencies were such that, due to the persistent rumors regarding the imminent establishment of the new "Central Bank," the price of pure gold rose sharply. The British and American gold pounds also uniformly increased by $3. British gold notes still saw little trading, and the market price remained stagnant. American gold notes initially rose to $16.90, but eventually settled at $16.85, an increase of $0.70 compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes followed the Shanghai exchange rate with a dramatic increase of $0.26. Canadian and Philippine notes also tended to strengthen. Demand for Japanese gold notes suddenly became strong, reaching as high as $1.54 in the evening market. Korean notes showed a slight upward trend, reaching $1.185 in the evening market.

### Discount Rate Increases by Half a Dollar

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange bills initially rose and then eased slightly. The discount rate rose to $6.50 in the morning and $5.50 for purchases. In the afternoon, it eased slightly to $5 for purchases and $6 for discounts, an increase of $0.50 compared to the previous Saturday. The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was listed at 6% for both the morning and afternoon markets, with no changes.

Yarn and Cotton

### Speculators Eagerly Buy, Yarn Market Surges, Double Horse Jumps $30

The yarn market continued to rise, with a particularly sharp upward trend. This was due to the abundance of rumors in the market, all indicating positive developments. At the same time, the tightening trend of foreign exchange rates and the soaring price of gold further excited the public, leading to intense buying. The market gradually advanced, but actual trading did not improve. The upward pressure was suppressed, but those outside the industry uniformly anticipated further gains. Today (12th) is the President's birthday, and the cotton yarn market is closed. 280 pieces of yarn were transported to Hong Kong yesterday.

The spot yarn market opened in the morning with favorable international news, creating positive sentiment. Buyers flocked in, and the initial price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was $1,265, an increase of over $10. Upon hearing that the foreign exchange rate was gradually decreasing, speculative buyers became even more eager, driving the price straight up to $1,282. Subsequently, a certain bank released a large quantity, causing the price to fall back to $1,271. However, the foreign exchange rate remained weak, and those who expected prices to rise were in the majority, pushing the price up again to $1,285. The closing price fell back slightly to $1,280. According to the statistics of transactions throughout the day, 6,440 bales were traded, with prices rising by $30. The amount bought by each group is listed as follows:

Fellow Traders 6,250 Hong Kong 190 Total 6,440

### Cotton Market Also Favorable

The current situation in the cotton market is also favorable. Due to the dramatic tightening of foreign exchange rates and strong public sentiment, the market is trending higher. However, factory demand has been very active. Various sources remain difficult to access. Middling cotton is priced at $286 to $305, Pila flower cotton at $217, and Changyinsha cotton at $140.

Foreign cotton prices. The New York cotton market opened in the morning due to speculative buying. Later, due to favorable Wall Street stock prices and buying by overseas cotton merchants, the closing price rose by six to seven pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian market situation was flat.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading. Yesterday, due to the sharp tightening of exchange rates, the combined cotton price rose sharply by over $10. The spot prices rose significantly as a result. Fellow traders were highly motivated, with some unwilling to release samples. Factories are temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach. Therefore, there were no reports of large transactions yesterday.

Piece Goods

### Yarn and Thread Soar, Fabric Prices Surge

The factory fabric market opened yesterday with a sharp increase, due to the soaring prices of yarn and money hoarders becoming eager to absorb goods. The asking price for coarse cloth increased by $0.15 to $0.50, fine cloth and fine twill increased by $0.50 to $0.75, bleached and dyed cloth increased by approximately $0.50, and poplin, fine wool, fine yarn goods, and greige fabric increased by $0.75 to $1.50. Over 1,000 pieces of various goods were traded on the street. The Zhejiang, Ningbo, and Shaoxing groups purchased over 300 pieces of fine cloth and colored cloth. The Guangdong and Hong Kong groups purchased over 100 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth. The northern Yantai group purchased over 100 pieces of coarse cloth and flannel.

Eastern Cloth. Strong buying activity from both within and outside the industry led to a dramatic increase in prices. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth jumped $1.34 per piece, opening at $36 and gradually rising to $37.10. The closing price fell back slightly to $36.90. Four Gentlemen broadcloth increased sharply by over $0.05 per yard, starting at $1.10 and closing at $1.04. This was due to the strong positive atmosphere, which made the market very firm.

Exports. 315 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong on the 11th, and 35 pieces were also shipped to Hong Kong on the 12th.

### New Outlets for Plain Camel Wool

Domestic wide and narrow camel wool used to make Russian hats and children's coats has seen its market sales plummet recently due to inconvenient transportation and a lack of transport routes. High prices and reduced purchasing power are also factors. Striped camel wool is even more stagnant, while plain and artistic styles are better. Artistic and plain camel wool have recently found a new outlet in making Russian hats and children's coats, broadening their market. However, this is limited to lower-end products, with a suitable price of over $2 to over $5 per yard. Children's and women's coats are mostly wholesaled at $130 per dozen, while Russian hats are mostly wholesaled at only $11 to $12 per dozen.

Securities

### Floating Long Positions Released, Domestic Bonds Plunge

The securities black market experienced a sudden downturn yesterday. Initially, it was due to the occupation of the Central Bank's former site. Subsequently, the surge in Yu Zi by $100 to $200 caused panic in the market. Floating long positions were released one after another, and the opening price dropped by approximately $1. Short sellers aggressively pressured the market, causing Class A bonds to break through the $70 level and Class D bonds to break through the $60 level. The situation was extremely dire. However, although there were many rumors, they were all unrealistic. Moreover, many short positions had been released, and there would inevitably be a short squeeze in the future. Furthermore, the general interest rate reduction by silver and money firms clearly indicated an unwillingness to absorb deposits, and various sources of funds still needed to find suitable destinations. It remains to be seen what will happen. Yesterday morning, Heng Kang, Heng Fu, and Lian He sold a considerable amount. At the time, Yu Xing and Chang Ji saw strong buying activity. Tong Shun and Xie Kang made some purchases, while Ren Chang and Le Mao continued to sell, causing the market price to become unsustainable. Retail investors also released a considerable amount. Class A bonds broke through $70, and Class D bonds, which had not been traded on the previous Saturday, dropped dramatically by $3 yesterday due to the removal of the draw rights, while the others fell by $1 to $2. Approximately one million dollars were traded in half a day. The market is closed this afternoon. Today is the President's birthday, and business is closed for the day. A summary table is listed below.

In stock trading, 50 shares of Central China Trust Company were traded at a price of $13.10.

Sugar Market

### Sugar Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market saw a sharp tightening of foreign exchange rates, with prices trending upward by over $2. Spot prices for 24 coarse white sugar were $75 at the local warehouse and $73.60 to $74.50 at foreign warehouses, an increase of $2.50. Taikoo Car B Mark was $75 to $75.50 at the western warehouse and $74.30 to $75 at the eastern warehouse, an increase of $1.35. DY Mark was $70 at the western warehouse and $69.60 at the eastern warehouse, an increase of $2.20. HX Mark was $70 at the western warehouse and $69.30 to $69.60 at the eastern warehouse. H Mark Car was $55 at the eastern warehouse. Dutch cotton white BS Mark was $70.50, an increase of $1.50. RA Mark was $75. Dutch red was $57.70 to $57.80, an increase of $1.70. The price for orders placed on November 6th was $58. Local factory No. 1 ice sugar was $95.50, an increase of $2.50. Jing Ming ice sugar was $97, an increase of $3. Several hundred bags of winter mist green sugar were also released, priced at $60.

Coal

### Coking Coal Arrives from Dalian, Over 500 Tons

The coking coal market has recently become sluggish, while the supply of train wheels remains constant. Over 500 tons of general coking coal arrived from Dalian yesterday. Various routes continue to see sales, but with declining interest from buyers, the market continues to trend downward. Transactions among fellow traders for general coal are priced at $145 per ton, screened coal at $160. For foreign warehouse train goods, an additional fee is added on top of the regular rate.

Silk and Tea

### Black Tea Sales to Germany Revive, Silk Cocoons Continue to Arrive in Shanghai

Yesterday, 11 pieces of silk fabric arrived from Wenzhou, and 20 pieces arrived from Hong Kong. In addition, 324 bales of silk cocoons were transported by ship from Wenzhou to port.

The local tea market has been particularly deserted in recent weeks. However, the sales of native black tea to Germany have recently revived. A total of over 500 boxes were purchased by firms such as Xingcheng and Jieshiman, priced at $280 to $290, with prices remaining firm. The green tea market remains stagnant. There is still demand for uncolored Fenmei pearl tea from abroad, especially for high-quality products. However, high-grade goods are rarely available due to supply disruptions. Sales of colored Zhenmei pearl tea are also stagnant. Furthermore, 285 pieces of tea were transported from Wenzhou yesterday (11th), and 100 pieces will be transported to Hong Kong today (12th).

Hardware

### The Depressed Market for Steel

The market for steel has been somewhat sluggish recently, mainly because the supply routes from Tianjin are intermittently disrupted. Also, merchants from Yantai, Qingdao, and other regions have not been making many purchases. Furthermore, the actual sales of local factories are low, with only canneries and braising factories making some acquisitions. Otherwise, there is no activity, making the market feel particularly depressed and people feel listless. As a result, the standard prices have slightly loosened compared to before. For example, high-quality steel from old steel factories is now selling for $170 per 200-pound crate, while steel from new steel factories is selling for $165 per 200-pound crate. It is estimated that the actual transactions yesterday were around 100 crates.

### Jesus as Lord of My Heart (2)

(2) Jesus – Lord of the Mind: The structure of our thoughts is also what Jesus wants to reconcile. Thought is an essential element in shaping character. The human thought mechanism does not emerge from nothing; it merely processes the material we put into it, using it to create our character, making us what we imagine ourselves to be. As the saying goes: "As a man thinks in his heart, so he is."

People sometimes casually say, "I can think whatever I like." But this is not accurate. Just as we cannot do whatever we want, neither can we think whatever we want. If I have malicious intentions towards someone, I will naturally treat them unfairly. Thought is the source of words and actions. What I think, I will say and do. Therefore, Jesus said, "For out of the heart come evil thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander." (Matthew 15:19) People must first think of these things before they can carry them out.

If we regard Jesus as the Lord of our hearts with holy intentions, that is what Paul said: "We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ." (2 Corinthians 10:5) We listen for Jesus to control our minds, rejecting any thoughts that cause Him grief, and refusing to think about anything He does not want us to think about.

Conscious thought can also be cultivated, because a person's thoughts can be controlled by their willpower. We should learn the secret to controlling our thoughts. Even better is to allow Christ to control your thoughts in your inner consciousness. If He is the Lord of our minds, the peace of God will guard our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:7). In this way, we can think about what is honest, just, pure, lovely, and of good repute. Only those who honor Jesus as the Lord of their minds will know that thought is the greatest pleasure in life, because Jesus dwells in their hearts through faith, and they will set their minds on things above, rejoicing in all that is noble and beautiful.

Free Debate: Where Should Women Go? (3)

### Women Should Return to the Home

— Qi Zhai

(4) Women and the Nation: Since women are the "mothers of society," they are naturally also the "mothers of the nation." We all know that a small number of excellent people can rule a large population of a low-level ethnic group. From this, we can see how important it is to pay attention to the mental and physical environment of women in order to ensure that the nation has healthy citizens, so as to avoid becoming a subjugated country or a colony. China is now in the midst of a struggle, and it certainly needs the full strength of its 450 million people, but if we ask politicians to make weapons, medical experts to dig trenches, or engineers to run education, then even though we mobilize the entire population, the strength we gain will be zero. We must allow each type of person to exert their strengths in order to achieve the greatest power. Women are certainly no exception, and they should exert their strengths to cultivate healthy citizens, so that everyone can be in their proper place. President Chiang Kai-shek advises the young people in the isolated islands to work hard in their studies and not to go to the mainland. Is he嫌嫌人力太多或不要奮鬥了？。 He simply has superior insight. He knows that the current manpower and future manpower are equally important. If we only care about the present, using up all of our current strength without generating new strength, then when the time comes when there is no one to follow up, we will simply have to let others slaughter us. Therefore, women cultivating national construction to contribute to the long-term struggle or future restoration is also an important task for the current citizens.

(5) Women and Career: A career is a kind of work that benefits society, the nation, or the world. If a job can unleash the inherent abilities of the worker, it will definitely achieve solid results and benefit society and the nation. The key is a job that can adapt to physiological limitations and psychological influences. Women have a "maternal love ability," and according to Thorndike's tests, their sympathy, patience, and instincts for paying attention to people all exceed those of men, so they are very suitable for educating children. V. Sirtaunas said, "A good mother is better than a hundred teachers." In the biographies of great people, we can also see that great people become great people mostly because of the influence of their mothers. This is all created by women's special abilities. Therefore, if women engage in raising children, they will definitely achieve the highest results and the greatest achievements. Being able to cultivate a few great people to benefit society, the nation, and the world can truly be considered the most beneficial work and the greatest career. The key is that any work that is not subject to the control of dates, times, and locations, so that it does not affect the inherent functions of women, and that is beneficial to society and the nation, can also be regarded as women's second career.

### Women Should Go to Society

— Yi Hui

(4) Women and the Nation: Women are members of the nation, and they have the same responsibility for the rise and fall of the country as men. Therefore, women's contribution to the country solely through their physiological function—producing small citizens—is not enough. They need to actively participate in all the work that creates a strong new China. The theory that "a small number of excellent people can rule a large population of a low-level ethnic group" is worthy of our discussion. A few imperialists are indeed in a superior position of oppression and exploitation against the majority of small and weak nations. However, what creates this superior situation is their inherent excellence, or the strength of their financial power and military might? If it is said that women should raise healthy citizens at home to prevent the country from becoming a colony, then is the reason why China has become a semi-colony to be blamed on women for not educating their children to become healthy citizens? However, for thousands of years, Chinese women have faithfully fulfilled their responsibility of raising children at home!

(5) Women and Career: An individual's choice of career should be based on their interests and talents. This is the case for men, and it is also the case for women. Some women have a special interest in children, and they are good at guiding children. This kind of talent should not only be their own child's nanny and teacher, but also the nanny and teacher of dozens or hundreds of children. She should not only educate her own children to become great people, but also educate many other people's children to become great people. A good mother can certainly be better than a hundred teachers. A good teacher can also replace a hundred or several hundred mothers who can raise but cannot teach. Because these women who regard child care as their career can constantly research and experiment to obtain the best methods of child care from their work. In this way, many other women can also pursue various careers that are beneficial to society according to their preferences, because there are child-rearing experts to raise their children for them. Since sympathy, patience, and attention to people are women's strengths, women should take on more leadership responsibilities in society. If the leaders of a country are all rich in sympathy and patience, then the happiness of the people will definitely be greatly increased. Why don't we use women's strengths to create greater happiness for mankind? (To be continued in the next issue)

The Hawthorne Case

### The Dancer's Fate

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 11 Zhao Baixiong's Confession

Hawthorne said lightly, "But he still sold you out."

Zhao Baixiong smiled and said, "Yes, but he can't be blamed for that. Because I looked out of place staying outside the shop, I exchanged all my clothes with Nai Kui. His figure is similar to mine, and his attire is exactly the same, so it's naturally not easy to tell them apart. It was only after your detective partner followed him away that I was able to freely come here to visit you."

I seemed to have entered a dream state, and I was really confused. Zhao Baixiong was clearly a wanted criminal, how could he dare to come to the door himself and put on this hypocritical politeness? Even more strangely, how could Hawthorne treat him with courtesy? He had been looking for this person for a long time, so why didn't he arrest him immediately? Could I make a phone call to Ni Jinshou?

Hawthorne said coldly again, "Mr. Zhao, I must remind you. If you were more careful, you wouldn't say that you are a free man at this moment."

Zhao Baixiong's body slightly lifted off the chair. "Mr. Hawthorne, what do you mean by that? Are you planning to —?"

Hawthorne shook his hand and said, "Not that. You haven't been very free on your way here."

"What? Is someone watching me again?"

"Yes, I believe at least one person escorted you here. Would you like to meet him? ... Shi Gui, go to the door —"

Zhao Baixiong hurriedly waved his hands and said, "Mr. Hawthorne, no need, no need. I really admire you, you are truly a detective genius. I think someone with your talent should take on more important tasks for the nation and the people."

Hawthorne replied with a stern face, "I don't think you came to see me at this moment just to say a few words of flattery to me, right?"

Zhao Baixiong said, "Of course not. But you must understand that these few words of mine are really from the heart, and not hypocritical perfunctory remarks. I have two purposes for coming here: first, to apologize; second, to explain the misunderstanding." (163)

### Greed

— White Dog

Greed only accumulates money, and reduces its effectiveness in all aspects. -- Taylor

One can fill a box with favors as easily as filling a heart with gold. -- Spencer

In the eyes of the greedy, the world is too small. -- Latin Proverb

The chests of the greedy are rich, but they themselves are not rich. -- English Proverb

Why are we so blind? What we accumulate, what we possess, and what we hoard, is it ever for ourselves? -- Madame de Stael

The life of a glutton is as if the world was created for him, not he for the world. He only knows how to take in, but not how to give out. The only convenience that the greedy person gives to his neighbor is to let them know that he is just as dissatisfied with what he has as they are. -- William Pitt

### The Giant's Birthday

— Wei Min

—In Memory of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Birthday—

Seventy-five years ago today, at the eastern end of the earth—on the land of our motherland, a child was born. Following the arrival of this child was the Republic of China; it was the overthrow of the Manchu Qing dynasty and the establishment of a democratic republic. However, this child worked like an ox and a horse all his life to save the nation from danger, and today, this savior of the nation has closed his eyes for fifteen years, but this democratic republic has not yet been fully established. However, the history we have written in blood over the past three years, this, the most glorious page of the national revolution, will be dedicated to our national giant, the national savior, Mr. Sun Yat-sen! —It will guarantee the completion of the arduous tasks left by our savior!

### Xin Yanqiu's Elegant Skill in Painting Orchids

— A Visit

Performers' hobbies often involve a penchant for associating with refined arts. Through constant exposure, there are not a few among them who are skilled in calligraphy and painting. Occasionally, the wonderful works of performers are highly praised. For example, Shi Huibao's Wei stele style, Cheng Yanqiu's Zhang Menglong stele style, are bold and majestic, reminiscent of the Six Dynasties, even professional calligraphers would admit to being inferior. Some also use their artistic talents to create paintings, such as Mei Lanfang, Wang Yaoqing, Jiang Miaoxiang, Shang Xiaoyun, Liang Xiujuan, and Li Shifang's paintings of birds and flowers, Wang Fushan's butterflies, and Li Wanchun's Buddhist images, all of which are charming and considered rare and valuable. As for those who are by nature serene and do not seek fame for their paintings, yet their strokes are worthy of being passed down through generations, Xin Yanqiu's orchids are indeed commendable.

Xin Yanqiu is skilled in painting orchids, with exposed roots and no soil, entirely emulating Zheng Sixiao. The ink blends with the mist, no less beautiful than Xiang orchids. Years ago, I saw someone write a poem for Wang Yuhua, "Ode to Painting Orchids," which said, "The girl painting orchids is only eleven years old, with hair hanging down to her eyebrows, dark as lacquer. Her eyebrows are like willow leaves, her smile bright, combining two beauties in one. In the song, she sings two tunes. She is from an old family that moved from Wuxia back to the capital, playing the pipa in a house with loquat trees. Her orchid heart is naturally a forget-sorrow herb, her blushing face a naturally smiling flower. An old man in the capital has long been decadent, seeking fame to visit her boudoir. The troupe originally had many talented branches, and her cloud-like hair also learns to sing courtyard flowers. Not long after returning, the south wind carries news that peace negotiations will be completed and the dark clouds will disappear. Four hundred thousand people are simultaneously disarming, and the imperial city is filled with rumors of war. As they come and go, the people tremble, and they must cross by boat. … On the seventh day, the Southern army entered the Forbidden City, and the bamboo cane in the corner points to a distant private residence. During these seven days, everything is desolate, and singing and dancing cease. Yuhua stays at home with her mother, and her ten fingers produce fragrant orchids. You have been learning to paint orchids for just over a month, and your skill is equal to three years of work. The peach blossom blood is similar in red, but the willow leaf eyebrows are not as green. Apply fragrant paintings to sandalwood fans, and their value doubles upon entering the market. The people of Chu give fragrant herbs to beautiful women, how could they lightly let the fragrant fan fall? Alas! Old Su Shi used orchids to compare to beauties, and beauties in turn write portraits for orchids. She is transcendentally different from the world, like a fairy, and her royal fragrance is herself. She can support her mother in the chaotic Beijing, and can perform the Rainbow Skirt Dance in peaceful times. The exposed roots entirely emulate Zheng Sixiao's flowers, born in the Six Kingdoms, how could she have soil! Don't you see that my poem should be included in the national history supplement, not just talking about love for children, painting orchids is also a person escaping Qin, the color is Qin and Chu. Stop singing the Southeast peacock flies, stop singing the Latter Lord phoenix song… " The new performer is an advanced female performer, who had the title of chairperson of female performers in her early years. The poem describes another piece of history. She has faced frequent setbacks in recent years, and many people pity her fate. When [Ran Du] came to Shanghai this time and reread this poem, with her orchid heart and jade quality, she may feel overwhelmed by the contrast between the past and present.

### Wang Yin Directs "Thinking About It"

— Silver

Wang Yin has risen from film actor to director, achieving good results. His recent film "Country Girl" was very popular, further establishing his position as a director.

It was rumored that Wang Yin would direct the costume drama "Spring Lantern Riddles" after "Country Girl," but this is not entirely true. Wang Yin is currently working on "Thinking About It," which is a stage play recently completed by Cao Yu. Guolian Film Company is adapting it for the screen as a modern drama, a comedy full of satirical meaning. Yuan Meiyun is the female lead, and Wang Yin himself does not act in it.

The plan for Wang Yin to direct "Spring Lantern Riddles" does exist, but the script has not yet been adapted, so he is filming "Thinking About It" first. "Spring Lantern Riddles" was originally a play by Mei Lanfang, and it is now being adapted into a film based on the Peking opera. Wang Yin plans to prepare for "Spring Lantern Riddles" after completing "Thinking About It."

(1) Wang Xichun

Wang Xichun was formerly a singer in Nanjing, a typical figure from the "Qinhuai Family," but she was ambitious and knew how to cherish her artistic life. She did not belittle herself, and through diligent efforts, she transitioned from Qingchang (a cappella singing) to formally performing on stage. Her debut was at the Nanjing Grand Theater around 1936. Her initial partner was the laosheng (old male role) Zhao Yunsheng, and later Gao Baisui, who is now also with Carlton Theatre.

After the war, Xichun went to Hankou and collaborated with Zhao Ruquan and An Shuyuan at the Tiansheng Stage. I once saw her perform "Yutangchun" with Zhao Ruquan as the blue-robed [actor] and An Shuyuan as the red-robed [actor]. In a performance of "Farewell My Concubine," with Zhao Ruquan as Xiang Yu, just as Consort Yu was about to dance with her sword, an air raid siren went off, and all the lights in the theater went out. The performance resumed half an hour later. I think this was also a memorable day in Xichun's acting career!

I first met Xichun in Hankou. She lived in a lane behind the Tiansheng Stage, not far from the Railway Hotel. I don't remember the name of the lane. I visited her one afternoon. She came out to meet me wearing a simple floral qipao. She was very talkative and told me a lot about her singing in Nanjing and her apprenticeship in opera. She also talked about the Nanjing journalists and Tian Han. Tian Han was very supportive of her when he was in Nanjing. Before I left, she gave me a autographed photo. (See above picture)

In the summer of 1938, Xichun was invited by the Yifeng Drama Troupe to go from Hankou to Hong Kong, and then from Hong Kong to Shanghai. She began to collaborate with Zhou Xinfang at the Carlton Theatre. She gained widespread praise shortly after her debut with the play "Consort Xiang's Regret." Later, she also appeared on the screen, starring in several films such as "Wen Sucheng," "Consort Xiang," and "Meng Lijun." She even became the owner of Chunming Film Company, which produced "Meng Lijun."

Xichun's acting is known for its subtlety. She is best suited for playing young girls who are just experiencing love. She has a nickname called "Little Crow," and she is still as innocent as a young girl. (Tomorrow: Sun Jinglu)

### Rambling Talk on "Waterloo Bridge"

— Shuang An

After the release of "Gone with the Wind," Vivien Leigh became extremely popular. Now she stars in "Waterloo Bridge," and audiences have been eagerly awaiting it. The male lead in "Waterloo Bridge" is Robert Taylor. The strangest thing is that when Robert Taylor went to England to film "A Yank at Oxford," Vivien Leigh played a seemingly unimportant supporting role and was not noticed.

Vivien Leigh's hard work is commendable. She worked continuously for twenty-three weeks on her role as Scarlett O'Hara in "Gone with the Wind," only resting for three days. It took her a full nine weeks to play Myra in "Waterloo Bridge," without a single day of rest. She would seize any free time on set to knit woolen items and donate them to soldiers in her country. She was also the vice president of a relief organization. During the filming of "Waterloo Bridge," she desperately ate chocolate to maintain her weight of 106 pounds. She ate it pound after pound, which amazed onlookers. It is said that her weight once reached 110 pounds.

The producer of "Waterloo Bridge" is Sidney Franklin. His previous masterpieces such as "The Good Earth," "The Life of Emile Zola," and "Mrs. Miniver" are all well-known and immortal works. The director is Mervyn LeRoy, who is also a top-notch master. "The Wizard of Oz" has already given us a profound and majestic impression. With such excellent talent behind the camera and such talented actors, how could this film not be a success?

Five months of preparation were spent before filming began, and seven weeks were spent on the initial storyboards alone. The so-called storyboards are to draw the necessary shots in advance as a reference for actual filming. This meticulous attitude is truly worthy of being emulated by those who are lagging behind in the eighth art.

### Autumn Mountain Waterfall Viewing

Ms. Yang Shiyu is the niece and granddaughter of Yang Lingfu, a famous family in Wuxi and a female painter. She has a family background and also studied with Gu Qingyao in Wuzhong, learning landscape painting, which is extremely elegant. She has both talent and learning, reaching the highest level. The painting on the right is her recent work.

Lei Chuanxiao is the daughter of Lei Songfentang Lei Xuedao in Wuzhong. She once studied with Gu Qingyao, and her landscape painting style is extremely ancient and unrestrained. The picture on the right is her recent work.
