### Japan's Struggle

The issue between China and Japan has a history of over sixty years. From the late Qing Dynasty to the eve of the War of Resistance, almost every possible solution has been tried. However, the result of its development has only proven that war between the two countries is inevitable, and only a thorough war is the only way to thoroughly resolve the China-Japan issue. Therefore, this situation of resistance may be seen by some as unfortunate, but it is actually a historical necessity.

The emergence of the Far East as a problem lies, on the one hand, in China's accumulated weakness in the past, and on the other hand, in Japan's ambition to annex China and dominate East Asia. Since Japan took the lead in the Meiji Restoration, it has consistently regarded China as the target of its expansion for decades. Saigo Takamori's theory of conquering Korea, Okuma's Twenty-One Demands, Tanaka's Memorial, and the various measures and actions of the Japanese military clique since the September 18th Incident all treated China as meat on the chopping block. Even the Japan-Wang Jingwei documents disclosed two months ago still show that the Japanese military clique's dream of invading and subjugating China has not awakened. As long as the ambition of the Japanese military clique is not completely liquidated, how can there be peace in the East, and there will be no true peace in the world. Therefore, China's War of Resistance, from any perspective, has the necessity to thoroughly fulfill its objective mission. This is also a major obligation that China bears towards the East and even the world.

As for China's past weakness, it is an undeniable fact. Unfortunately, in the middle of revolution and construction, everything just saw the dawn and was invaded. Now, it has completely changed. Undoubtedly, this is an important side harvest in the War of Resistance. The unity and progress in the political and military fields need not be said. Even the increase in international reputation and the tempering of national character are not things that can be achieved overnight in peacetime. Other things such as transportation construction, economic development, the progress of inland society, and the improvement of culture in the border provinces are all obvious facts that are universally recognized. What is particularly valuable is that from more than two years of this arduous effort, a strong confidence and decisive perseverance have been forged, showing the revival of the Chinese national soul and the resurrection of national youth. All these achievements in the middle of the War of Resistance cannot be obliterated by any slander. Any ancient country often accumulates too much dross left over from history in society, causing the nation to form a morbid state, and even giving people a sense of aging. Under such circumstances, getting rid of the old and bringing forth the new is often several times more difficult than starting from scratch. However, once a national war against foreign countries is engaged in, either it will be completely defeated and collapsed, or it will achieve rapid progress in a very short period of time. This is also a common occurrence in ancient and modern history. The unification of Germany, the independence of Italy, and the revival of Turkey are all obvious examples. This time, China needs a national war against foreign countries. The first step to success is to smash the other side's strategy of a quick victory, which is the first step to overcome the crisis of complete defeat and collapse. From then on, it has transformed into an opportunity for rapid progress. The glorious magnificence of Germany, Italy, and Turkey is indeed a precedent, while it is an unprecedented miracle in Chinese history. It was because China was weak that the Sino-Japanese War was triggered, but at the same time, it was because of the tempering of this war that China turned from weak to strong. In the midst of the war, China did suffer significant damage, but it also gained more because of the war.

Everyone believes that China is by no means a militaristic nation. If China engages in war, then this war must be absolutely unavoidable. In other words, China would never resist unless absolutely necessary, and would not resist until the last moment. The War of Resistance is by no means to go to death, but to seek survival. Therefore, at the beginning of the outbreak of the War of Resistance, there was a clear estimate of the future prospects, and the determination to persevere in the War of Resistance and endure painful sacrifices was made. Today, reviewing the bloody experience of more than two years is enough to prove the wisdom and intelligence of the estimate at that time, and it is in line with the factual deduction. Now, even though it is not yet the stage to drive the Japanese army out of China, sufficient confidence and certainty have been gained. Moreover, in the long stalemate, the Japanese army has actually become weakened and exhausted, and the military and civilians are tired of war. Its turn to step up political offensives shows that it has lost military confidence. Looking back over the past year, the Japanese army's defeat in central Hubei, its re-collapse in northern Hunan, the mixed battles in western and southern Shanxi, and the defeat in Binyang and northern Guangdong have all proven the decline of the Japanese army's strength and the failure of its invasion attempts. Although it also once achieved a small victory in Nanchang, Chaozhou, Shantou, Qin, Fang, Yong, and Ning, it ultimately failed to save its overall war situation. Recently, the Japanese side is at a critical juncture of making a desperate political offensive and going against the tide. The battlefields in southern Guangxi and western Sui have once again brought news of the recapture of Lingshan and Wuyuan, which is just like a head-on blow to that offensive. Recently, the frequent movements of the Japanese troops on various fronts are probably to echo their political offensive with their final struggle. However, as long as the Chinese military and civilians are firmer and more invigorated, the Japanese side's new military deployment will inevitably fall into the same predicament of being unable to advance or retreat as its political offensive. There is no doubt that the future of China's War of Resistance will not be affected in any way.

China's liberation and progress, and East Asia's stability and peace can only be achieved through victory in the War of Resistance. Apart from this, any methods and plans will only increase chaos and disturbance. This is the destiny that history has destined, and it is also the point that the world should recognize most clearly.

### Soviet Union Plans to Establish Defenses on North Pacific Islands, Sufficient to Threaten Japan's Wartime Food Supply, Japanese Councilor Suggests Purchasing Primorsky Krai

New York: It is rumored that the Soviet Union is currently planning to establish defensive fortifications on the Kamchatka Islands off the coast of Siberia. The New York Times today criticized this specifically, believing that after the Soviet Union deployed submarine bases on these islands, it will threaten the shipping of Western countries in the Pacific, especially when a war breaks out between the Soviet Union and Japan, which will be sufficient to threaten Japan's food supply. It also has harm to the military strategy position of the US Navy, because from these islands to Dutch Harbor in the United States, it only takes five hours to reach by plane.

### Three Years of Japanese Invasion of China, Resources Depleted: Canadian Bank Annual Report Details Japanese Economic Situation

Washington: The "Washington Evening Star" stated yesterday that the establishment of a "new government" in Nanjing, as announced from Tokyo, as a sign of China's revival is a "laughable fabrication." The newspaper stated in its editorial that Japan's creation of this "new government" is a "cunning scheme that cannot deceive the Chinese people and the world." Chairman Chiang still possesses considerable strength for resistance, while the depletion of Japan's domestic economy and its strained relations with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are its greatest difficulties. After three years of war in China, Japan is now in a dilemma of national collapse and diplomatic isolation, and will soon try to end this undeclared "incident." (United Press report, 24th)

New York Airmail: The Royal Bank of Canada recently released its 1939 annual report, detailing the Japanese economic situation, stating, "Japan's war against China has lasted nearly three years. Although the country's war-making capabilities are not completely exhausted, it can be confidently said that its resources have been severely depleted. Therefore, in recent months, most people in the country have felt that, for Japan's sake, the China situation should be brought to an end in a relatively short period." (Havas report)

### Joint German-Italian Policy: Maintaining Peace in the Balkans; Italy Will Not Allow Foreign Forces to Enter Yugoslavia; Germany Plans to Restructure the Economic Organizations of Southeastern Europe

Paris: Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki is currently visiting Rome. Political figures here are commenting that, given the situation in Southeastern Europe, Prime Minister Teleki's trip is of extraordinary significance. However, the European situation has greatly changed since Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky visited Italian Foreign Minister Ciano several months ago. Foreign Minister Ciano had offered a promise, stating that if Hungary were attacked by the Soviet Union, Italy would come to its aid, provided that Hungary would maintain close relations with Romania and temporarily abandon its demands for border revisions. At that time, the Soviet-Finnish War was in a stalemate, and Ciano's promise could be considered timely. Since German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met at the Brenner Pass and formulated a joint policy on the situation in Southeastern Europe, the Danube region and the Balkan Peninsula seem to be jointly "protected" by Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union. However, since Italy is determined to prevent the current war from spreading to Southeastern Europe, it is still unknown whether it will allow Soviet forces to enter the area. One of the issues that Prime Minister Teleki should explore with the Italian authorities is this. (Havas report, 24th)

Paris: Béchet, Vice Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, recently published an article in "L'Ordre," commenting on the situation in Southeastern Europe. The gist of his remarks was that "Yugoslavia is as important to Italy as Czechoslovakia is to Germany. It is to be expected that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini would not want the forces of other countries to extend into Yugoslavia." (Havas report, 24th)

Paris: Newspapers here have recently reported from the capitals of the Balkan Peninsula countries that Germany is currently promoting a broad plan to restructure the entire economic organizations of the Southeastern European countries, demanding that these countries reduce part of their military equipment, reduce industrial production, and thereby increase the quantity of agricultural products to supply Germany. It is also reported that detailed production plans have been drawn up for each country, with detailed content. This will certainly be quickly addressed by Britain and France, and Italy's attitude is also worth noting. (Havas report, 23rd)

Basel, Switzerland: Newspapers here recently received news from Central Europe that Germany's proposal for Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union to jointly provide guarantees to the Balkan Peninsula countries has encountered difficulties. According to the Basler Nachrichten, the countries concerned in the Balkan Peninsula have not welcomed this plan and have even expressed suspicion because Germany has not consulted them. Yugoslav diplomats even believe that the country has no diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, and it is doubtful whether the country can accept Soviet guarantees unless Italy adds strong pressure. In short, the Balkan Peninsula countries generally believe that Germany's proposed guarantee plan is unlikely to succeed. It is speculated that its intention is to urge the Soviet Union to pursue a more cautious policy in the Balkan Peninsula. (Havas report, 23rd)

### Hungarian Foreign Policy: Avoiding Involvement in the War; Temporarily Not Raising Treaty Revision Demands; Hungarian Prime Minister to Meet with Italian Prime Minister Tomorrow

Rome: It is believed here yesterday that Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki will hold talks with Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano next week. (United Press report, 24th)

Rome: After Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki arrived here yesterday, Foreign Minister Ciano hosted a banquet for him in the evening. Many important figures from both Italy and Hungary were invited to accompany him. Newspapers here recently commented on Prime Minister Teleki's visit, praising Hungary's current policy, which is to temporarily not raise demands for revising the peace treaty, saying that any country that uses inappropriate means at this time to resolve individual problems will inevitably expand the scope of the current war and only harm the interests of non-belligerent countries. Hungary's refusal to do so is admirable. (Havas report, 24th)

Rome: Political figures here believe that Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki's visit to Rome has confirmed the general impression after Hitler and Mussolini met at the Brenner Pass, that Italy believes that Hungary's demands for revising the treaty have no opportunity for discussion at present. "Il Giornale d'Italia" stated that Hungary is well aware that in the current situation, it is not allowed to make special demands and disrupt the peace of the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube region. "Il Popolo d'Italia" stated that after the Hungarian Prime Minister meets with the Italian authorities, it will certainly enhance the friendly relations between Hungary and Slovakia, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and Romania. Hungary does not give up its rights, nor is it eager to realize its goals, but waits for the appropriate time. Hungary's foreign policy is to avoid involvement in the vortex of war and cooperate with Italy to maintain peace in Southeastern Europe. (Haitong report, 24th)

Berlin: The German Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, the "German Diplomatic Political Correspondence," declared that Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki's visit to Italy will not have surprising results. Countries that maintain friendly relations should maintain close contact, and it is especially necessary to maintain contact during serious times. The leaders of the Axis powers have recently held talks, and countries that maintain friendly relations with the Axis powers are also urgently discussing the Danube issue with the Italian authorities. Southeastern Europe has been spared disturbances due to the keen insight and responsible spirit of the authorities of various countries, but certain issues remain to be resolved to avoid countries taking advantage of the disputes between the great powers to make attempts. The Allied powers have considerable intentions to incite the disturbance of various countries in Southeastern Europe, but Southeastern European countries such as Hungary have rejected this temptation and demonstrated the foresight of their politicians. All countries in Southeastern Europe must avoid involvement in the vortex of war. Germany and Italy closely monitor the happiness of Southeastern Europe and will do their utmost to maintain peace in Southeastern Europe. (Haitong report, 24th)

### Pope Sternly Condemns International Acts of Aggression: Heartbroken at Dishonesty and Destruction; Prays to God for Early Restoration of Peace

Vatican City: Pope Pius XII recently preached to the faithful in St. Peter's Basilica, condemning acts of violating public reason and destroying treaties, as well as unrestrained desires for conquest. He said, "What kind of era are we in? You should be aware of this. The harmony of nations has been broken, solemnly signed treaties have been unilaterally modified or destroyed, all things that are beneficial to the prosperity and progress of all nations have been derailed, and even the public reason on which the mutual relations of civilized nations are based has been violated. For example, undefended cities and villages inhabited by farmers are often bombed by airplanes, residents are shocked, houses are destroyed, fields are damaged, and ordinary civilians and the old, weak, sick, and disabled who have no self-defense capabilities are either bombed to death or displaced and homeless." His words were truly heartbreaking. "I now piously pray to God to ensure that the monarchs and royalty of all countries and people can enjoy peace and be in harmony." (Havas report, 24th)

### Nordic Alliance Unlikely to Become a Reality Due to Opposition from Both the Soviet Union and Germany

Moscow: Soviet newspapers commented on the plan for Sweden, Norway, and Finland to sign a defensive alliance, believing that the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty has completely thwarted the Allied powers' attempt to incite war in Northern Europe. The Nordic countries have already been outside the war zone, and the Allied powers naturally cannot accept this. The Soviet Union is working to realize peace and mutual cooperation among the Nordic countries, and the true background of the so-called "defensive alliance" is to establish an anti-Soviet front. (Haitong report, 24th)

London: Well-informed sources here recently stated that the proposal for Finland, Norway, and Sweden to form a defensive alliance treaty may not be easily realized. Since the Soviet Union has already expressed its opposition to this, and Germany has also adopted the same attitude, the Swedish government is deeply afraid of causing disputes as a result, so it is hesitant. According to Germany and the Soviet Union, if this alliance treaty can have anti-British and French implications, so that their forces cannot extend into the Nordic countries in the future, and at the same time increase the volume of trade with the two countries, then Germany and the Soviet Union can support it. However, according to the actual situation, the Scandinavian countries intend to conclude this treaty as a tool for self-defense, which is the opposite of what Germany and the Soviet Union intend, so it is to be expected that they will express opposition. Norway and Sweden, in view of this, would rather adopt a more subtle attitude towards the belligerent countries and do not want to conclude a treaty to invite future troubles. For this reason, the proposal for the three Nordic countries to form a defensive alliance is very difficult to realize. (Havas report, 23rd)

### French New Prime Minister Meets with British Ambassador

Paris: Prime Minister Reynaud met with British Ambassador Campbell this afternoon for discussions. (Havas report, 23rd)

### Molotov Has Not Stepped Out of the Country: Soviet News Agency Ordered to Refute Rumors

Moscow: Recently, foreign news agencies have spread news that Soviet People's Commissar Chairman Molotov will go to Berlin or other German cities, and there are also rumors that Molotov will go to Western Ukraine. TASS has recently been officially authorized to solemnly declare that these rumors are pure fabrications and have no basis. (TASS report, 24th)

### Hitler Spends Easter, Will Deliver a Speech in the Coming Days

The Hague: The "Commercial Report" recently carried news from Berlin that German leader Hitler is now spending Easter in Berchtesgaden and will deliver an important speech in the coming days. It is also reported that the draft of the speech has already been completed. (Havas report, 24th)

### Soviet General Election: Unprecedented National Unity

Moscow: The Supreme Soviet elections of the Ukrainian and Belarusian Republics will be held tomorrow. Today, various people held rallies. In the Lviv rally, 20,000 people participated, including Ukrainian Communist Party Central Committee Secretary Khrushchev and Pominsterko. Koslev, Chairman of the Lviv District Executive Committee and candidate for the Soviet Supreme Soviet, delivered a speech saying, "Millions of voters will tell the enemy that our current unity is unprecedented. Do not try to destroy our interior." (TASS report, 13th)

### Reason for Search of Welles' Ship: Allegedly Someone Had a Forged Passport; British Blockade Intensifies

London: Reuters learned from official circles that the Italian mail ship "Conte di Savoia" was indeed searched by the British, because British officials received intelligence that an important person was traveling on this ship with a forged passport. (Reuters report, 24th)

London: London officials have not confirmed the claim that the Italian mail ship "Conte di Savoia" was searched by the British in Gibraltar in order to arrest German economic expert Dr. Schacht or other wanted figures. British officials are also unwilling to explain why the Italian ship was searched. According to news from New York yesterday, the Italian ship was detained for thirteen hours and searched very thoroughly in order to find Dr. Schacht, who was rumored to be on board. It is noted that U.S. Undersecretary Welles returned to the United States on this ship after touring Europe. (Reuters report, 23rd)

Amsterdam: The Gibraltar British authorities' inspection of passengers on the Italian mail ship "Conte di Savoia" is considered by the outside world to be a more severe measure of the British blockade than before. Because this Italian ship was heading to a foreign port, the ships previously inspected were all ships returning to Italy from foreign ports, and the main purpose was to abduct Germans of military service age, and did not involve all passengers. From the standpoint of a neutral party, searching passengers in a neutral country's ship is like the British authorities exercising police power in neutral territory. (Haitong report, 24th)

### British Railway Workers' Union Resolution Urges Government to Stop the War: Believes the War Hinders Work Interests; Willing to Continue Fighting for Socialism

London: The Essex group of the Railway Workers' Union passed a resolution yesterday demanding that the government quickly end the war against Germany. The resolution stated, "This union strongly condemns this imperialist war that harms the interests of our workers. We demand a quick end to the war and an international conference to discuss the economic needs of all countries and the fair distribution of fuel. We demand a referendum to resolve the issue of ethnic minorities. We demand an end to the political truce. Our leaders should continue to fight for socialism and fight for the people of all colonies, because only socialism can bring lasting peace to the world." Smith, Chairman of the National Committee of the Independent Labour Party, said in Nadderham yesterday that the current European war is "another evil struggle for power politics." The committee rejected the Railway Workers' Union's proposal, but agreed with the peace proposal, joining with neutral countries to make peace with Germany, restoring the independence of Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, and ensuring that Germany will no longer stir up trouble when another international alliance or federation is formed. Smith also said, "Whether war or peace, I oppose Chamberlain's tenure." (United Press report, 24th)

The Soviet Union and the European War

### Written by Former Czech General Staff Colonel Moravec

Haitong News Agency Airmail: Based on close observation of the military situation, this European war is completely different from the previous European war. Imperial Russia was an ally of Britain and France. From 1914 to 1917, Germany had to keep two-fifths of its troops on the Eastern Front. Before the collapse of Imperial Russia, Germany only had three-fifths of its troops to deal with the British and French forces. As a result of Germany's three-year war with Imperial Russia, the German army suffered more than one million casualties and prisoners. However, last year's German-Polish campaign lasted only one month, with only 14,000 casualties. When the German army attacked Amiens in March 1918, the German army had 40 divisions, which was about one-sixth of the total military strength, still stationed in Russia. Today, German officers do not need to station a large army in the east, nor do they need to station air and artillery troops for defense. For the sake of maintaining order in Poland, only the police and security teams are sufficient. Today's Soviet Union not only has no malice towards Germany, but also provides food, fuel, and minerals to help it. There is one more thing about this: the Soviet Union does not need to send troops to aid Germany. It only needs to exert pressure on places that are crucial to the interests of Britain and France, such as Iraq, Pakistan, and Syria, to be effective. Moreover, the Soviet Union faces the Pamir Plateau, which connects to the key points of British India. Is the Soviet Union expected to advance or retreat? In the previous European war, Britain and France had Imperial Russia as an ally and could dispatch troops from India, Africa, and Australia to attack Turkey. At the same time, Imperial Russia could also put pressure on Turkey from north to south, so the entrance to the Suez Canal and the Persian Gulf would not be threatened. If the Bohemian Basin can be called the center of Europe, then the area located between the five seas can be called the center of the ancient world. The five seas are the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Aegean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Arabian Sea. Today's Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, Arabia, and the northern part of Iran are located in the area between the five seas. In this area, Britain not only possesses rich oil fields, but its air routes connecting the four continents of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia also use this as a hub. In this area, if Britain loses its power, the fate of the British Empire will not be long, and the coming of bad luck can be counted on the days. Furthermore, Germany today only has one front and can concentrate all its forces in the Rhineland area, while Britain and France must take into account the safety of overseas colonies and naval bases, and they are exhausted and in danger. France must station troops in Tunis to prevent Italy, station troops in Morocco to prevent Spain, and station troops in Syria to strengthen Turkey's ability to resist the Soviet Union. Therefore, France cannot mobilize colonial soldiers to Europe to help in the war as it did in the past. The difficulties that Britain is encountering today are similar to those of France. Only a very small number of troops can be mobilized from India, and the fortresses in Iraq and Pakistan need to be reinforced. In 1915, the cavalry of Imperial Russia had already drunk water from the Tigris River. At that time, Germany and Russia were at odds, and the Russian army had to use five-sixths of its military strength to defend the German-Russian border. Now that the two countries have turned enemies into friends and have no worries, where will the Soviet army go if it goes south? How can it be said easily? France has a small population. If it loses another two million people in this war, it will no longer be able to dominate the ranks of the great powers. The war between France and Germany requires the help of the troops from the colonies of Britain and France, but because they are under pressure from the Soviet Union, Italy, and Spain, it is difficult to achieve their wishes. Therefore, they have to reluctantly place the heavy responsibility of defending the Maginot Line entirely on the shoulders of their own people. In short, the Soviet Union's benevolent neutrality not only caused the failure of Britain's blockade policy, but also made it difficult to concentrate the strength of the British and French forces. Germany's observation is like this, and knowledgeable people should not think it is nonsense. (Translated by Wang Shanshang)

### Norway Lodges Another Protest with the German Government, Demanding Punishment for Pilots Who Bombed Norwegian Ships; Denmark Also Prepares to Negotiate with Belligerent Nations

Oslo - Following Norway's protest to Germany on March 8 against Germany's methods of naval warfare, Norway lodged another protest with the German government yesterday, demanding punishment for German pilots who recently machine-gunned and bombed two Norwegian merchant ships. The first Norwegian protest was issued regarding the incident on March 3 when the Norwegian ship "Leisekek" was strafed by a German plane, leaving the ship riddled with bullet holes but without injuries. The second note mentioned the German plane bombing the Norwegian ship "Brorodt" on March 1. This ship was later escorted by a lifeboat and sailed into a port on the east coast of England. As the crew lowered the lifeboat to escape, the German plane opened fire on them again. It is reported that seven crew members died as a result. (Reuter, 24th)

Norwegian Capital - The Norwegian ship "Dora Ellis" was attacked by a German plane on the 20th of this month, killing three crew members on the spot, with two others, including the captain, injured, one of whom is in critical condition. This has been confirmed by the captain, who stated that the ship was flying the Norwegian flag but was still bombed. In addition, the Norwegian Telegraphic News Agency reported that the Norwegian freighter "Lindoe" was also attacked by eight German planes on the 20th of this month, which dropped six bombs, all of which landed near the ship. According to one crew member, the German planes also machine-gunned him, but missed. A warship then arrived, opened fire with anti-aircraft guns, and drove away all the German planes. One of them seemed to have been badly damaged and probably could not fly back to its base. (Havas, 23rd)

Danjing - Well-informed sources say that the Danish government instructed its ambassadors to Britain and Germany on the 11th to make contact with the governments of their respective host countries in the hope of finding appropriate measures to ensure that Danish ships are no longer accidentally damaged due to naval warfare. However, six more Danish ships have recently been lost one after another. The external authorities are conducting a detailed investigation into the circumstances, and as soon as the results are obtained, they will negotiate again with the responsible belligerent party. (Havas, 23rd)

Danjing - The Social Democratic newspaper, which has close ties with the Danish government, commented today on the sinking of five or six Danish ships by German submarines in the past few days without warning, saying that Denmark felt particularly painful during this Easter. Before the British submarine sank the German ship "Hedderheim" off the coast of Denmark on March 21, it gave the crew a 15-minute warning. There is no need to compare with other incidents. We certainly acknowledge that Germany is currently at war with Britain, but we cannot accept this unfair form of warfare. (Reuters, 23rd)

London - After the Danish ships "Possehl" and "Viking" were recently sunk by German submarines with torpedoes, the country's ship "Christiansborg" was hit by a torpedo fired by a German submarine in the North Sea on the 20th of this month, killing one crew member. The rest have been rescued and have landed in a port in Scotland, one of whom has both legs broken and has been sent to the hospital for treatment. In addition, it is rumored that German planes flew over the eastern coast of Scotland today, seemingly to inspect the traffic of merchant ships at sea, but the Aviation Department has not received any information to confirm this. (Havas, 23rd)

### Air Force Activity on the Franco-German Front; German Planes Continue Reconnaissance Over Britain

Paris - The communiqué on the battles of the past 24 hours released here states that several strong German patrols approached the French line near the Barace River, and the French army repelled them without difficulty. The weather is more conducive to air activity, and both sides dispatched some aircraft, but no air battles were reported. British aircraft continued to patrol the North Sea, while French and German aircraft were active over the front line. Several French aircraft, protected by fighter planes, flew out to take photographs of German defenses and military targets, and repeatedly penetrated deep into German territory day and night, carrying out long- and medium-range reconnaissance flights. German aircraft were extremely active over the French lines in Alsace and carried out long-range reconnaissance flights in northern France. (Reuters, 24th)

Berlin - The German High Command issued an official communiqué this afternoon stating that there were reconnaissance activities and artillery battles on the Western Front yesterday. Despite the abnormally bad weather, the German Air Force flew to eastern France for reconnaissance. Last night, several enemy planes flew to northern Germany for reconnaissance, and one Wellington aircraft was shot down by German anti-aircraft guns. (Haitong Agency, 24th)

London - Several planes, certainly from the enemy, approached the coast of Scotland yesterday, and their purpose was obviously to reconnoiter shipping routes. This is the third day that enemy aircraft have flown to Scotland for reconnaissance. (Reuters, 24th)

It is reported that in addition to dropping several bombs in Danish territory, British aircraft also dropped a large bomb in Tarum. (Haitong Agency, 24th)

Bijing - The Ministry of National Defense has just issued a communiqué stating that the German Deutsche Nachrichten-Agentur issued a message yesterday saying that several British or French aircraft had invaded Belgian airspace on the night of the 23rd of this month. According to the investigation by this Ministry, a foreign aircraft did invade the eastern airspace of this country at midnight on that day, but none of the border watchtowers were able to identify its nationality. One of the watchtowers reported that the aircraft belonged to Germany. As it was late at night, the country's air defense authorities had no certainty to determine this, and so it was reported to this Ministry as "nationality unknown." According to the country's practice, we are not willing to make conjectures without solid evidence. (Havas Agency, 23rd)

Hejing - Several aircraft of unknown nationality flew over the Dutch cities of Arnhem and Urk between 11:00 pm and midnight last night. In addition, traces of these aircraft were also found over the northern provinces. Their direction was both from west to east and from east to west. (Havas, 24th)

### Soviet Newspaper Advocates Building More Railways to Facilitate Eurasian Commercial Transport; Passenger Trains Between Lening and Viborg Have Resumed

Moscow - An article in "Gudok," the mouthpiece of the Soviet Railway Commission, advocates building a railway from Baku to Maqushkara in the Caucasus. If this plan can be realized, the route and time for Soviet oil to reach Germany can be greatly shortened. The article also advocates extending the existing railway from Gurguf to Kandagas to Vorosk. After this route is completed, the route from Baku to Siberia or Central Asia can be shortened by more than 1,000 kilometers, which will have a major impact on commercial transportation. (Haitong Agency, 24th)

Moscow - The government has just announced that the railway from Lening City to Viborg Port (formerly belonging to Finland) will resume passenger trains starting tomorrow, twice a day. In addition, telegraph and telephone communications between the two places will also be gradually restored. (Havas, 23rd)

### Indian Muslim Association Passes Constitution; Provinces with Muslim Majority Should Be Treated as Independent Countries

Lahore - Representatives from 40 Indian states attended the founding conference of the All-India States Muslim Association. The organization of the Association includes people from various states, but it is not within the scope of the activities of the All-India Muslim League. The congress passed a constitution identical to that proposed by the All-India Muslim League and decided that constitutional reforms in various states must be discussed with Muslims before implementation. (Reuters, 24th)

Lahore - The Resolutions Committee of the Indian Muslim Congress today passed a resolution to be submitted to the Annual Congress for consideration, reiterating that the federal method stipulated in the recent Indian Autonomy Act is completely unsuitable for India and cannot be implemented. It also stated that Indian provinces with a Muslim majority should be treated as independent countries, with effective guarantees attached to protect minorities. This is a fundamental principle, and any constitution not based on this fundamental principle is unacceptable to Muslims. The resolution authorized the Working Committee to formulate a constitutional outline in accordance with this principle and stipulated that each independent region should have full power over national defense, diplomacy, transportation, and customs. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Irish Republican Army Creates Havoc in Prison, Beating Jailers and Setting Fires; Police Suppression Quickly Subdues Situation

London - The Irish Republican Army in Dartmoor Prison in England took advantage of the opportunity when there were fewer jailers on Saturday and Sunday to beat prison staff and set fires. Suddenly, there was a lot of noise. The jailers rushed to the prison upon hearing the alarm, driving the troublemakers back into their cells and trying to put out the fire. After about two hours, the fire was extinguished. The roof of the cell block where the Irish Republican Army was detained had been burned through. When the news of the incident first came out, everyone suspected it was a large-scale prison escape. Police from nearby districts immediately came to assist, and the prison was immediately placed on alert. After the fire was extinguished, everything returned to normal. According to the Home Office, a small number of Irish Republicans were causing trouble in the prison, setting fires, but the damage was minimal. (Reuters, 24th)

### Rare Bible Discovered in Romania, Valued at 1.5 Million Lei

Lojing - An antique dealer in Romania discovered a rare treasure in the library of a wealthy man in Yassai: 50 beautifully illustrated copies of the Bible were printed in the mid-17th century to commemorate the achievements of Mazarin (who was initially a papal envoy to Paris and later a leading figure in French politics), known as the "Mazarin Bible," which are extremely valuable.

### The Appearance of the Puppet Central Government; Overview of the Situation in Nanjing; The Puppet Central Government Cannot Control North China

A dispatch from the mainland newspaper on March 20 from Nanjing stated: "The Central Political Conference" held its first meeting here this morning and will pass resolutions previously decided upon, and Chinese "officials" will hand over the occupied areas to the "government" organized by Chinese "officials." However, the heavy secrecy surrounding the conference has increased the curiosity of the city's Chinese residents. The population of Nanjing before the war was about one million, but it is now only half of that number. Although five-color flags are still hung in many places, the number of small "officials" wearing the blue sky with a white sun badge is increasing daily, and the blue sky with a white sun badge is also prominently displayed on the windshields of public cars. The public is confused as to why, and this point has not been explained in detail. Nanjing is still a world of soldiers. The so-called post-war reconstruction consists only of simple houses, providing only shelter from the wind and rain, without any plans for future development. Two-story buildings have been built on both sides of the main roads, with relatively high-rise banks interspersed among them, which look sturdy, but only on the outside, with rubble still in the back. The desolate scene reminds one of Zhabei in Shanghai. Although a Japanese division is stationed throughout the city, it is rarely seen. They are all stationed in solidly built barracks, and those seen on the streets are stationed in concrete fortifications at intersections. It is rumored that these Japanese troops will soon be transferred to Wuhu, so that the "new government" will have the false appearance of being able to manage its own destiny, but there is no evidence to confirm this rumor. What the "Political Conference" announced yesterday was that Chinese industries currently under Japanese control would be returned to Chinese administration, but the progress of this move would be quite slow. If this statement cannot be implemented, the "new government" will be hampered from the beginning, unless Wang Jingwei can deliver on his promises and not just make empty talk. Then, the people under Wang's rule will see no difference between Wang and the Japanese army. Thirty representatives gathered at the International Club this morning to pass resolutions previously decided upon and automatically promote the establishment of a new "government." The "Political Conference" is currently convened in accordance with the "constitutional" provisions and must pass several important resolutions before adjourning. One of the resolutions is to liquidate the two "temporary" and "reformed" "governments." According to visitors from Beiping, the "new government" will nominally control North China at most, except for foreign relations. There are currently at least 900 military police from Beiping in the city of Nanjing, and it is expected that another 1,500 will arrive here within days. In terms of domestic forecasts, this may be of great significance.

### Japanese Soldiers Tired of War Commit Suicide in Jiaozhi Town, Suzhou; Tang Dynasty Sculptures of Arhats Safe and Sound

A correspondent in Suzhou reported that more than 60 soldiers of the Goto Detachment of the Japanese army are stationed at Baosheng Temple on Nanjie Street in Jiaozhi Town, this county. On the morning of the 16th of this month, the Japanese army there suddenly received orders to go to eastern Zhejiang to fight. When the roll was called at the time of departure, it was discovered that one soldier was missing. The Japanese officer in charge of the team initially thought that he had gone out shopping and had not returned. By about 9:00, he was still nowhere to be seen, and he became suspicious. He immediately ordered his subordinates to search in all directions. As a result, he was found in the firewood room in the temple, lying on the ground in a suicide attempt, barely breathing. The Japanese military doctor diagnosed him and determined that the poisoning was deep and beyond saving. The Japanese soldier soon died.

Also, the Tang Dynasty sculptures of Arhats in the town, which were previously rumored to have been shipped to Japan, are confirmed to be safe and sound and are being properly cared for by the town. Strong iron fences have been built around them, and they are locked to prevent damage.

### Shanghai Circles Commemorate Yu Manto; National Government Orders Posthumous Recognition; Lawyers' Association Plans Memorial Stele; Five Hundred Attendees Reflect Utmost Honor; Yu's Remains Scheduled for Burial at Jing'an Temple Cemetery on the 27th

After Yu Manto, Criminal Division Chief of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court in Shanghai, was murdered in the line of duty on November 23rd of last year, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Lawyers' Association, the Dangyang Sojourners Association in Shanghai, and leaders from all walks of life in this city held a memorial service at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 500 representatives from all walks of life attended. The general assembly resolved to petition the National Government for posthumous recognition. Yu's remains are scheduled to be buried at the Jing'an Temple Cemetery on the 27th of this month. The details are as follows:

Solemn Atmosphere at the Venue

The four walls of the memorial service venue were hung with elegiac couplets, creating a solemn atmosphere. Yu's portrait was hung high above the stage, radiant and awe-inspiring. Yu's posthumous calligraphy and poetry were also hung on both sides of the entrance to the venue. Those who attended deeply mourned upon seeing his posthumous works. Above Yu's portrait hung a white cloth banner from the Lawyers' Association that read "Sacrificed Life for Law." Among the elegiac couplets hanging on the four walls were those from Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, Xie Guansheng, Minister of Justice Administration, and various groups in this city. In particular, the elegiac couplet from Yu's younger brother, Mr. Dafu, was especially striking. The couplet read, "Heaven ruins the talented Wang Lang, integrity is seen in times of adversity, each with a clear reputation that spread throughout the country. Heaven and earth support justice. The spirit grieves for two nights, relying on blood debts to settle Liaodong." The wording was impassioned, sad, and extremely moving. The seats in the venue were divided into left and right sections, with the left section for female guests and the right section for male guests, totaling more than 300 people.

Memorial Circumstances

The presidium of the memorial service included Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Wen Lanting, Xu Jiyi, Chen Shichang, Jin Tingsun, Ru Baoyi, Liu Shaokui, Xu Zuoliang, Wu Zhengzhuo, Yuan Yang'an, and others. The memorial ceremony was quite solemn. After playing mourning music, the chief officiant, Yu Qiaqing, and the assistant officiants, Wen Lanting, Xu Jiyi, Yuan Ludeng, and Du Kanghou, took their places one after another. Next, the chief officiant offered flowers. Lin Kanghou and Xu Zuoliang read the memorial oration. Then, everyone stood at attention and bowed three times. Next, Jiang Baqian reported on Yu's life. Chen Tingrui delivered a eulogy and discussed permanent memorial measures, including the Lawyers' Association's construction of a memorial stele to commemorate Yu's martyrdom. It was also decided to telegraph the National Government for posthumous recognition. Finally, Yu's wife delivered a speech of thanks, and the ceremony was concluded.

Central Government's Preferential Treatment

According to reporters investigating with the memorial preparation committee, after Chief Judge Yu was murdered in the line of duty in Shanghai, the central government expressed deep condolences. President Chiang telegraphed condolences to the family and provided a pension of 10,000 yuan. Yu's eldest son, Yu Minfang, went to study in the United States last year and will also be given official funding by the central government to complete his studies. This demonstrates the authorities' care for the bereaved family. Yu had two sons and four daughters. The eldest daughter has completed her university studies and is now working in the cultural field in Hong Kong. The others are still young and studying in Shanghai. Yu's remains will be buried on the 27th of this month. The memorial preparation committee announced that Yu Manto will be buried at the Jing'an Temple Road Cemetery (end of Foch Road) at 3:00 PM on the 27th of this month. All those who knew Yu well and wish to attend the ceremony are invited to come to the cemetery at that time.

Request for Posthumous Recognition

The request for posthumous recognition reads: "To Chairman Lin of the Chongqing National Government, Shanghai Jiangsu High Court Second Branch Criminal Division Chief Yu, has served in Shanghai for eight years. His reputation is widely praised. He was suddenly murdered in the line of duty on November 23rd. His integrity was awe-inspiring. The tragedy of his death is unprecedented in the judicial community since the war of resistance. Upon investigation, this deceased Chief Judge served as a judicial officer for nearly thirty years, known for his integrity and impartiality. He served as a law professor at various universities in the north and south, as well as at the Judicial Training Institute and Chucun Hall. He educated numerous students throughout the country. His contributions to cultivating talent are indelible. Throughout his life, he was filial to his parents and fraternal to his brothers. His ordinary virtues and actions are worthy of admiration. All the details of his death in the line of duty and his life's achievements have been submitted in detail by his family and should be reviewed. Various circles in Shanghai jointly held a memorial meeting on the 24th of this month to express their condolences, demonstrating the depth of public grief. We, Qiaqing and others, have witnessed this and are deeply in awe. Having witnessed this deceased Chief Judge sacrifice himself for the country, we cannot remain silent. Therefore, we earnestly request that you approve a clear order for posthumous recognition and generous compensation, and that his death in the line of duty and his life's achievements be proclaimed in the national history, to comfort his loyal soul and encourage future generations. We await your orders with utmost trepidation. Respectfully submitted by Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Lawyers' Association, Fuyang Sojourners Association in Shanghai, acting Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Xu Jiyi, Xu Zuoliang, and others."

Memorial Oration

On the 24th day of the third month of the 29th year of the Republic of China, Yu Qiaqing and others respectfully offer this simple memorial offering to the spirit of Yu Manto, saying: "Alas, our esteemed Yu, a national scholar, heroic and outstanding, with pure virtue in his person. Born in Dangyang, endowed with spiritual beauty, having completed the Confucian classics, he extensively studied in the Pan Palace. In his youthful years, he traveled to the east of the sea, studying law with great precision, his reputation filled the world. As an old officer of the Han court, he was a model of lectures, educating talents with great joy. His equal-weight writings have the same merit as Han and Shang. His poetry and prose are elegant, succeeding Fang Weng. His paintings excel in landscapes, following Da Chi. He was benevolent in heart, treating all things equally. He enforced the law without bias, being just and honest. Encountering a world in turmoil, his five internal organs felt disturbed. Although he had the intention to retreat, he still upheld his steadfastness, unafraid of power, and fearless of the Rong soldiers. He sacrificed his life for righteousness, leaving a lasting reputation. With the beam broken, who will support the mansion? A teacher of law, literature, and art for later students, we pay tribute and offer sacrifices, our tears flowing silently. His heroic spirit is unwavering, eliminating violence and ensuring safety. Alas, alas! Please accept this offering." The Lawyers' Association's memorial oration is omitted.

Wife's Memorial Oration

On the 24th day of the third month of the 29th year of the Republic of China, the widow Chen Yin tearfully offers this simple offering to the spirit of my husband, Manto, saying: "Alas, my husband, unfortunately, was suddenly assassinated. Without leaving a word, he departed forever. Alas, how painful! The karmic connection in this life has been severed, and there is no hope of reunion in the next. Separated forever by life and death, my heart and liver are torn apart. My husband's life was pure and selfless, frugal in building a family, and dutiful to his parents and siblings. Since the national crisis, our family has been unfortunate. First, my mother-in-law was killed, and now my husband has sacrificed his life. How cruel is heaven to our Yu family? I hate that the murderers have not been brought to justice and lament that national law cannot be upheld. Sacrificing his life in blood only won him fair public opinion. How can I not be sad? Recalling the past, under the lamp by the window, in the autumn of banana sounds and night rain, you said that although heaven and earth are vast, we two are dependent on each other. You deeply wished to relinquish the responsibility of a judge, retire to our hometown, assist society, improve production occupations, and popularize women's education. You enjoyed poetry and painting, while I enjoyed photography and planting flowers. Among famous mountains and rivers, there were always traces of our two travels. These feelings and words are vividly before my eyes. How long ago was it that it all turned into bubbles? Now that you have sacrificed your life, it is not difficult for me to sacrifice my life for you. Considering that the children are still young, raising and educating them are the responsibilities of those who remain. Why take one's life lightly to follow you? I can only steal a breath in this world,勉力抚孤，以慰君灵于地下。君如有灵、来歆来格、呜呼哀哉、伏维尚飨、

### 工部局董事選舉　日方提出要求　一再向費利浦提出交涉　結果增日監票助手二人

Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) Board of Directors Election: The Japanese side made demands and repeatedly negotiated with Mr. Fessenden, resulting in the addition of two Japanese assistant poll watchers.

The results of the Municipal Council's current Board of Directors election and the British community candidates' primary election have been announced. The elected members are H.E. Hale, K. J. Tweedy, Mitchell, Rotherick McDonald, and Powell. The American community candidate, Arroman, Karna, McDonald, is in the midst of voting, with results expected to be announced on the 26th. Regarding the five Chinese directors, there is talk of re-election. As for the issue of the number of Japanese directors, the Japanese side has used the increase in the Japanese population as an excuse to demand an increase, which has not yet been resolved. This matter has attracted considerable attention from all parties. According to an announcement from the Japanese side, the Municipal Council has made concessions regarding this election law due to the Japanese side's seven demands. According to the Japanese side's account of the negotiations, on the 19th of this month, Mr. Hayashi, the current chairman of the various Japanese Associations, raised the following seven conditions during a visit to Mr. Fessenden: (1) Due to the sharp increase in the number of Japanese residents with voting rights, one of the two election committee members in charge of this year's election should be Japanese. (2) Based on the above reason, this one election committee member (i.e., the poll watcher) should be selected from among the Japanese. (3) To guide Japanese residents who do not comply with the election rules, Japanese instructors selected by the Japanese community should be responsible for guidance at the polling place. (4) To ensure the accurate receipt of Japanese residents' voting certificates, the Japanese Residents' Association should collect and distribute them in full, without the Municipal Council mailing them out. (5) Due to the increase in the number of voters, the election time should be extended. (6) The names of the Japanese director candidates should be recorded in Japanese in addition to English on the ballots. (7) Japanese residents should be allowed to write their ballots in Japanese. At that time, Mr. Fessenden agreed to the third, sixth, and seventh articles, but for the first article, he only allowed Japanese residents to serve as assistants. For the second article, he said that the two members of the election committee had already been determined to be Norwegian Mr. Bertel and Swedish Mr. Bringer. For the fourth article, he said that it was still appropriate to mail them to each voter and could not be entrusted to the Japanese Residents' Association for collection. For the fifth article, he said that the Land Regulations had already stipulated and could not be changed. The Japanese representatives believed that the Municipal Council's response was unsatisfactory, and on the 21st, Consul General Miura met with Mr. Fessenden to discuss the matter. As a result, Mr. Fessenden expressed his willingness to comply with the fourth and sixth articles and agreed that the Japanese community would select two assistants to assist the election committee. As for the number of Japanese directors, there is currently no indication whether the Japanese side can abide by the "gentleman's agreement" of the British, American, and Japanese ratio of 5:2:2.

### 英僑候選人履歷

British Community Candidates' Biographical Information

Following the announcement of the results of the Municipal Council's Board of Directors election and the British community candidates' primary election, the outside world expressed its approval. The reason is that the elected individuals are all experienced in the work of the Municipal Council. The biographies of each of the elected candidates are as follows:

(1) Hale: Manager of Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., has been in China for over thirty years. He has been serving as a director of the Municipal Council since last year.

(2) McDonald: Manager of Jardine Matheson & Co., Ltd., has been in China for thirty-eight years. He has been serving as a director of the Municipal Council since 1937.

### 棉織業職工會　昨開成立大會

Cotton Textile Workers' Union held its inaugural meeting yesterday.

The entire body of workers from undershirt and sanitary shirt factories in this city organized the Cotton Textile Workers' Association, which held its inaugural meeting yesterday. Over 900 members attended, passing the constitution and discussing proposals: (1) To continue to re-establish standard wages based on the plan determined at the preparatory meeting, to restore piecework wages to the original state of 1933, and to request a double increase for hourly wages to provide financial assistance. Resolved and passed. (2) Labor savings should be implemented, and the employer should be asked to assist in the process. Resolved and passed. (3) Member job placement should continue according to the original plan. Resolved and passed. (4) Providing medical treatment, medicine, emergency loans, compulsory education, and all welfare matters should be expedited. Resolved. According to Article 15 of the constitution, a board of directors was organized, and it was decided on the spot to hire Shen Yaoting, Wang Haicheng, and He Xianli as directors. (5) Approved the declaration. Finally, the election results were announced, and He Xianjun, Yang Youcai, Zhang Xichang, Shi Heguang, Xue Liangcai, Wang Zhiban, Lu Fudi, Wang Hejin, Mao Dafu, Li Genlin, Qiu Wenxuan, Zhang Xianyu, Changsheng, Lu Laisheng, and Zhu Zhenbin were elected as executive committee members. Ji Zhongqing, Xu Zhibin, Xie Fusheng, Su Guan, and Xu Rongchun were elected as supervisory committee members. The declaration stated briefly that the wages of our cotton textile workers have been reduced by two-tenths over the years. On the contrary, the standard of living has continued to rise. The difference between the past and the present is more than several times. Workers are forced to bear an increasing burden of inverse proportionality. For the sake of livelihood, we should ask the employer to restore the original wages for piecework and to increase the wages for hourly work by double, which has not yet been resolved. Looking at the wages of various countries in the world, they all change with the social environment and standard of living to stabilize the livelihood of workers. Even the regulations on minimum wages in our country's factory law are based on the living conditions of workers in each factory location. Especially since the price increase, many employers in various industries have automatically increased wages, with many previous examples. We ask people from all walks of life to uphold justice and show sympathetic assistance so that this case can be resolved as soon as possible and maintain the spirit of labor-management coordination.

### 中國西南實業協會建議　救濟上海工業辦法　飭四行擴大貼放組貸款銀團　實施便利內滙辦法准請申滙

China Southwest Industrial Association Suggests Ways to Rescue Shanghai Industry: Order the Four Banks to Expand Discounted Loans, Organize Loan Syndicates, Implement Convenient Internal Remittance Methods, and Approve Applications for Remittance.

The China Southwest Industrial Association suggests ways to rescue Shanghai's national industry: (1) The central financial and economic administrative authorities should send responsible personnel to Shanghai to investigate the current production and sales situation and internal organization of each factory in conjunction with various public organizations to understand the true situation. (2) The central financial authorities should supervise the joint office of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Central Bank of China to notify their branches in the interior and Shanghai that they should make every effort to handle and implement the interim measures for facilitating internal remittances approved by the Ministry of Finance for factories that have been identified in the previous item and have accurate proof, so as to ensure thoroughness. (3) The central financial authorities should order the four banks' discount committee to expand the amount of discounts for Shanghai industry, encourage commercial banks to jointly handle industrial loans, or organize industrial loan syndicates to underwrite loans to factories that are solid in content and have reliable guarantees. At the same time, the four banks' discount committee and the Shanghai Bankers' Joint Preparatory Association should be ordered to act as a backing for commercial banks by means of refinancing, so that funds can be used properly or speculative activities can be suppressed. (4) Please ask chambers of commerce and other organizations to organize joint industrial groups to handle matters such as investigating and identifying the content and production and sales of various factories for the government and the financial community to consult, handle remittance applications, and review loans, which can be more convenient. (5) Shanghai factories that transport and sell goods to Hong Kong and Nanyang should settle and sell foreign exchange to the four banks in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's measures for exporting goods and selling foreign exchange to increase the government's foreign exchange income.

According to Gao's confession, the crime was committed with the involvement of Bureau Chief Cai and Minister Rong, who strangled the victim. The details have been recorded in previous reports. The case was originally investigated and concluded, and a verdict was scheduled to be announced. However, Judge Miao, who was presiding over the case, believed that the case still had unclear aspects. For the sake of caution, a more detailed investigation was needed to avoid injustice. Therefore, on the scheduled date of the verdict, the defendants were ordered to be brought to the case and the conclusion of the debate was revoked. A retrial was scheduled, and the debate was reopened. The defendants were returned to custody pending review.

### 中國科學社　昨追悼蔡孑民氏　並經決定永久紀念辦法

China Science Society Mourned Cai Yuanpei Yesterday and Decided on Permanent Memorial Measures

After the death of Cai Yuanpei in Hong Kong, the president of the Academia Sinica, the China Science Society of this city, held a public memorial service and memorial meeting at the Society's headquarters on Albert Road at 2 p.m. yesterday because Cai was the chairman of the Society and made great contributions to the Society. The details are as follows:

A glimpse of the auditorium: A white cloth banner was hung at the entrance of the China Science Society, with the words "Memorial Meeting for Chairman Cai." A half-mast flag was hung on the roof to express condolences. The memorial meeting was held in the auditorium on the second floor of the Society. A portrait of Cai was placed in the center, surrounded by green cypress and flowers. There were flowers and incense on the offering table. Dozens of wreaths were placed in front of the offering table, and the four walls were decorated with mourning couplets. The layout was extremely simple.

Visitors filled the door: Although the weather was continuously rainy yesterday, many members of the Society and guests came to mourn. The members included He Dekui, Gu Dingmei, Hu Dunfu, Sun Hongfen, Cao Huiqun, Yang Xuehuan, He Bingsong, Pan Xulun, Yang Shuxun, Song Wusheng, and Fang Ziwei. There were about one hundred guests. The chief officiants were Hu Dunfu, representing the Board of Directors, Sun Hongfen, representing the Council, and Cao Huiqun, representing the Shanghai Social Friends. Hu Dunfu was the chairman of the memorial meeting.

Memorial ceremony: The public memorial service and memorial service began at 2 p.m. Order: (1) Public memorial service: The chief officiants took their places, the whole body stood in silence, bowed three times to the portrait of Mr. Cai Yuanpei, remained silent, presented wreaths, played music, read the memorial text, the whole body sat down and played music. (2) The chairman of the memorial meeting delivered the opening speech, speeches, proposals, and the meeting adjourned.

Chairman's Speech: After the public memorial service was completed according to the above order, the memorial service began. Chairman Hu Dunfu gave a speech, stating briefly that Mr. Cai's articles and morality were admired by the world, and that he would not repeat them. Mr. Cai reached the peak in Sinology at an early age, and his philosophical research also had insights. He had a thorough understanding of various academic thoughts and immersed himself in research. He was by no means satisfied with a little superficial knowledge. He advocated promoting aesthetic education and promoting all education and culture. He was the highest ideal for the number of people. Chinese scholars, such as those who are well-versed in old learning, often become rigid and cannot learn from the past. Those who have made achievements in new learning often tend to be extreme. There are also those who are too subjective and have eyes higher than their heads. This kind of thing does not help academic culture. Only Mr. Cai can be inclusive. He presided over Peking University. From the old to the royalists, the new to the anarchists, he advocated lecturing and learning freely. His thoughts can keep pace with the times and never lag behind. He was very generous to younger students, and he treated people with sincerity.

Guest Speech: Then Cai's old friend Gu Dingmei gave a speech, briefly describing his friendship with Cai for 40 years and praising Cai's meticulous scholarship. Then He Bingsong took the stage to express his views. He said that Cai's founding of Peking University was a major turning point in the Chinese national revival movement. Cai's life had several characteristics: (1) He was humble and never felt satisfied with his own knowledge. (2) He followed the thoughts of the times and never gave up. (3) He was kind to others and could tolerate all things. (4) He devoted himself to the four words of academic salvation of the country until his death. Then Yang, Gu Hongfen, Cao Huiqun, and others gave speeches.

Permanent Commemoration: After the speeches, Yang Xiaoshu, the secretary-general of the Society, stood up and described Cai's achievements to the Society during his lifetime. The preparatory committee proposed permanent commemoration measures. The Nanjing Institute of Biology, which Cai loved very much, was destroyed by fire in the current war. It is proposed to rebuild it at a higher price, just like the "Mingfu Library" to benefit the academic community. This suggestion will be submitted to the Council for approval. The chairman also solicited the opinions of the members on other commemoration methods and asked them to submit them to the Council for discussion in writing. The meeting then adjourned.

### Children's Day Preparatory Committee Specifies Carnival Procedures and Notifies All Units That Prior Notification to the Police Authorities Is Required

In the past, various schools and child welfare organizations in this city held speeches, celebrations, and large-scale group parades on the Fourth of April Children's Day.

The committee has notified all schools and child welfare organizations in this city accordingly. Also, according to reports, the Children's Day Preparatory Committee, considering that there are still more than 20,000 impoverished children in Shanghai, has specially decided on a method for soliciting gifts, sending letters to all sectors of society requesting donations of 20,000 gifts to be distributed on Children's Day to express condolences.

### International Cup Soccer Final: Chinese Team Should File a Protest

Yesterday's Western Newspapers Unanimously Condemned the Referee

In the International Cup soccer final the day before yesterday, the Chinese team suffered a bitter 2-3 defeat due to a ridiculous and nonsensical penalty kick awarded by the referee. Yesterday, various Western newspapers, including the "North-China Daily News," "The Shanghai Times," and the "China Press," published news reports condemning this penalty. This shows that Chinese and Western people on the scene shared the same view. Although the award has already been given, the Chinese team should immediately file a protest in order to clarify the truth. Whether or not it is established is another matter, but it shows that someone cares. The so-called evidence is the reports in yesterday's newspapers, which are ironclad evidence. What do the authorities think?

It was decided that they would meet today at the Canidrome. However, it is the Qingming Festival, and the spring rain is incessant, which is a pity. The Western organizers, in order to end the season as soon as possible, have decided not to postpone it again. They will compete today despite the rain. The Chinese athletes, having had their within-reach International Cup championship ruined the day before yesterday due to an unwarranted penalty kick, will borrow from the spirit of Yue Fei and fight with their backs to the wall with a spirit of determination. In order to commemorate Mr. Gao Huaide, the late chairman, for his founding of the Lido Sports Association, in addition to wearing black armbands, they have also negotiated with the organizers to stand in silence for one minute before the game to express their condolences. The starting lineups for both sides are as follows:

Lido Association

Li Yichen, Zhang Linggen

Yan Shixin, Meng Yiliang, Jiang Zhaoxiang

Cao Qiuzhe, Sun Jinshun, Jiang Chao, Xu Wenkui, Zhang Mingsheng

### Old News Re-Copied: 67 Years Ago, From Our Paper of the 12th Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Late Qing Dynasty

The Situation of Money

In ancient times, people traded at midday, exchanging grains for tools and goods for goods. There was no need for currency, so the rulers and ministers of ancient times did not concern themselves with matters of currency. During the rise of the Zhou dynasty, Taigong created the Nine Offices, and currency began to be used in transactions. During the Han dynasty, in addition to coin-knives, springs, and silks, five-zhu coins were cast. By the Song dynasty, coins were cast with the reign titles of each emperor. The events before the Song and Yuan dynasties will not be discussed in detail. Only the events of the Ming dynasty will be discussed. During the Hongwu reign, financial resources were already insufficient. After the use of banknotes, they were repeatedly abolished and restored. The casting of coins was also stopped and started from time to time, which led to the uprising of bandits and the lack of national resources during the Chongzhen reign. As a result, various levies were created, and taxes were increased every year. However, taxes come from farmers, and farmers come from the land. If the land cannot be cultivated, only the circumstances are considered for taxation, which leads to the impoverishment of the people, who become bandits and destroy the dynasty. After the fall of the Ming dynasty, the princes, nobles, meritorious officials, and cabinet officials each presented their gold and silver to the bandit camps, amounting to countless millions, while copper coins were not considered very valuable. When Emperor Sizong was raising funds, his father-in-law Zhou Kui and chief minister Chen Yan only contributed 100 taels of gold to Emperor Sizong, but they gave millions to the bandits. After our dynasty established itself, silver was increasingly exported and copper coins were increasingly cast. By the Yongzheng and Qianlong reigns, the silver treasury was full and copper coins were abundant. By the Daoguang reign, it was not as prosperous as before. At this time, the silver mines in Yunnan were still open, so silver was not yet scarce. The coin bureaus were still casting coins, so copper coins were not yet in short supply. The reason for this is that most of the silver is hidden in private homes, or it flows overseas to be cast into foreign coins. Therefore, even though the Shanghai markets are the most important in the world, they would probably not be able to gather 1 million taels of silver or 1 million strings of cash in a single day.

### How Can Agricultural China Achieve Victory?

— Zhang Xiaomei

Misunderstanding of Economic Factors

In the context of highly technological modern warfare, it seems that industrialized nations, capable of producing new weapons, indeed hold an advantage over agricultural nations that rely on imported armaments. Consequently, a faction of defeatists has harbored doubts from the outset about China's "belief in certain victory in the War of Resistance and certain success in national reconstruction."

If their doubts genuinely stem from "concern for the nation," then their only responsibility lies in diligently assisting the government in devising methods to overcome the difficulties they perceive in their minds. However, if, out of fear of defeat, they engage in collusion with the enemy and acts of treason, then what is the real motive behind their so-called doubts? This becomes quite clear.

Regardless of their motives, analyzing the situation from both theoretical and factual perspectives reveals that the past two and a half years of the War of Resistance have sufficed to correct this defeatist theory. The fundamental error of this theory lies in its failure to grasp the concrete content of "economic factors." What do the economic factors of war refer to? Some say they refer to the so-called "three Ms" of "manpower, materials, and money." Others say they refer to productivity, especially the productivity of the military-industrial complex. The former can be termed the "resource theory," while the latter can be termed the "industry theory." The mistake lies in adhering to one extreme.

Possessing only abundant resources without corresponding productivity is akin to possessing only advanced industrial equipment without the corresponding manpower and raw material resources: both represent an unsound wartime economy. It is meaningless to speak of abundant resources, high productivity, or even of industrialized or agricultural nations. To assess the economic strength of two warring nations, the crucial aspect is to observe the relationship between the enemy's productivity and resource capabilities. Who has a closer and more coordinated relationship? If one possesses only abundant resources without corresponding productivity, it is like wealth discarded on the ground, rendering the abundance useless. If one possesses only advanced industrial equipment without adequate resources to support it, it is no more than a facade, lacking any real power. This reasoning is self-evident.

Wartime Economic Entities of China and Japan

Precisely for this reason, both China and Japan represent unsound wartime economic entities. To believe that China, being an agricultural nation, is at a disadvantage compared to industrialized Japan is indeed an erroneous observation. However, to believe that China, being vast and rich in resources, holds an advantage over resource-poor Japan is also seemingly true but actually false. The truth is undeniable: both China and Japan represent unsound wartime economic entities. The key to victory or defeat in the Sino-Japanese War lies in the degree of this unsoundness; which side is less unsound than the other?

Basis for Agricultural China's Chances of Victory

Let's first consider China: our nation possesses abundant mineral resources, but lacks corresponding production equipment, rendering this wealth useless, a significant deficiency. However, our national economy, and indeed our entire wartime economy, is still based on agriculture due to current factual limitations. Therefore, the crucial question is the extent to which our agricultural resources and agricultural productivity can complement each other. If there is land but no one to cultivate it, or if there is manpower but no land to cultivate, the problem would naturally be severe.

However, our nation is indeed a vast agricultural nation with abundant resources and a large population. The partial loss of land and population has not affected the overall sustenance of the national economy because their production and labor have not been abandoned. Although there may have been temporary pauses due to the war, they quickly resumed. Although the people and resources in the occupied areas are subjected to wanton devastation and plunder, the disruption of wartime freight transportation has forced some rural areas to naturally revert to their former self-sufficient state. In areas where freight transportation is still accessible, they have gained the possibility of increased income due to high prices. The Chinese farmers' virtue of hard work, endurance, and frugality is renowned throughout the world. They now resist the pressure of high prices for industrial goods with frugality, while enjoying the possibility of increased income through diligence. Moreover, the price disparity between industrial and agricultural products is gradually shrinking. All the feudal forces that previously existed in rural areas, such as the pressure from usury and land rent, have become invisibly loosened. Although some rural areas have experienced violence from Japanese puppets and gangsters, they have strengthened their will to resist the war in addition to enduring adversity. The most valuable aspect during wartime is the ability to sustain the national economy. If the majority of the people cannot maintain their livelihoods during wartime or feel the impact of the war deeply, then no matter how smooth things are militarily, a complete collapse is inevitable. However, the economic lives of farmers, who account for more than 85% of China's population, are not problematic. Therefore, the anxiety experienced by landlords, small citizens, and even salaried classes in Shanghai and other cities should be addressed, but it is evident that it is insufficient to affect the sustenance of our entire wartime national economy. Therefore, while China's wartime economy is unsound in terms of industry, it is perfectly sound in terms of agriculture. Precisely because China's roots lie in agriculture, the agricultural economy has become the foundation of the wartime economy. With the agricultural economic system fully sound, the crucial aspect of China's economic war of resistance is no longer a problem.

The Nominality of Industrial Japan

Of course, this is in comparative terms. If industrial Japan's wartime economy were equally sound, then agricultural China's wartime position would indeed be diminished in comparison. However, in reality, Japan's industrial economic system is fundamentally an unsound system. The main reason is that they only have considerable industrial equipment but lack the corresponding resources to support it. However, the industrial economy is the backbone of their entire national economy and even their wartime economy. The danger inherent in the industrial economy itself poses a threat to Japan's entire national economy and even its wartime economy.

From a theoretical perspective, a shortage of domestic raw materials can be addressed through imports. For example, virtually all the raw materials for British industry are imported from abroad. The reason why they were able to sustain themselves in the previous European war, and can largely be expected to do so in the current European war, lies in two reasons: first, they possess substantial financial resources for imports and also have vast overseas colonies providing raw materials; second, they maintain a powerful navy capable of sustaining their maritime transportation, and their position in international diplomacy is generally superior to that of their enemies. Otherwise, even if they have the capacity to maintain maritime transportation, they cannot function if neutral nations refuse to provide them with materials. However, Japan lacks both of these conditions. They are currently trying to replenish their own blood by relentlessly plundering resources from the occupied areas of China. However, unconditional plunder requires the backing of military force. In today's situation where their military strength is insufficient, large-scale plunder still relies on legal tender. This has resulted in a huge trade surplus with China, limiting the assistance it provides in terms of resource scarcity and foreign exchange scarcity. Therefore, they now have plans to restrict exports to China, which is clear evidence that they cannot rely on plundering Chinese resources to compensate for their own lack of resources. This pathological condition of mismatched resource capacity and productivity is undoubtedly the fatal flaw in Japan's wartime economy.

From a factual perspective, the Japanese government's production expansion plan in recent years can be described as swift and decisive. According to the decisions of the 74th Diet last spring, they plan to increase the production of steel and other products by 20% to three times, increasing the average value of production by 75%. Therefore, in the past year, new capital invested reached 5,308 million yen, nearly double the 3,976 million yen of the previous year. More notably, due to extreme panic within the country, they have relentlessly extended working hours for consecutive years. If the working hours in July of Showa 12 (1937) are taken as 100%, then the average working hour index for peaceful industries in July of last year was 85, and in October it was 96. The working hours in military factories increased from 121 in July to 133 in November. Although working hours have been extended so relentlessly, the production index has decreased in inverse proportion. For example, if the average of Showa 6, 7, and 8 (1931-1933) is estimated at 100%, then the overall index decreased from 181.8 in July to 155.6 in September. According to the Japanese government's own explanation, this was due to a sharp decline in the production of electricity and gas due to the coal shortage. In reality, the fundamental problem is still the shortage of raw materials and manpower. The Japanese government overestimated its abilities, only knowing the importance of increasing productivity, but not knowing that without the coordination of resources, the expansion of production equipment is just building castles in the sand, only making the raw material shortage in the industrial sector more obvious. The soaring prices in China are not surprising because the mechanism for price control has not yet been completed. However, in Japan, which has long implemented price control, the increase in prices has continued to keep pace with the times, which further highlights the severity of the resource panic within the country.

### A Word to Small Speculators

— Cao Zhenzhao

Price fluctuations depend on supply and demand. Scarce supply leads to high prices, while weak demand leads to low prices; this is a natural trend. If supply and demand are balanced and prices rise unreasonably, this is abnormal. The root cause lies in environmental pressures 30% of the time, and in powerful manipulation 70% of the time. Taking Shanghai as an example, the post-war population has suddenly doubled compared to the original. All consumption, such as daily necessities like rice and coal, has exceeded three and a half times the pre-war level, according to the Shanghai Municipal Council's workers' living index. Even if Sino-foreign transportation is blocked and freight rates are high, it should not be so disparate. There must be other main reasons, and the rise of speculation is also the biggest reason. Some small assets or salaried classes are preoccupied all day long, either fearing asset losses or finding that their income is insufficient to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, they rush to buy foreign exchange and hoard goods, thinking that this is the only way to preserve assets and increase income. However, they do not know that this kind of class is originally isolated from market conditions and completely ignorant of recent trends. Relying only on hearsay, on the one hand, they envy others' huge profits, and on the other hand, they want to seek asset security, sometimes buying stocks and foreign exchange, and sometimes hoarding goods and warehouse receipts, all following others' lead. If the foreign exchange shrinks occasionally, they feel anxious and rush to buy in; if the foreign exchange loosens occasionally, they fear losses and rush to sell. This kind of buying and selling, even if they are fortunate enough to profit, they must pay considerable commissions; if they are unfortunate enough to lose, it is really an unexpected disaster, and they cannot reach it. Moreover, this kind of speculative business has long been monopolized and manipulated by specialized operators. It is extremely unwise to pick up leftovers and be used by others. Therefore, to put it bluntly, even if speculation is feasible, they must ask themselves whether they are clear about the market situation? Whether the original assets are sufficient? Whether they will be affected if they fail? If none of these three conditions are met, it is better to deposit in the bank and earn interest. However, based on the general intention of people, there are the following three concerns about depositing in the bank:

(1) Bank interest rates are low, and the gains are small. Bank interest rates are only 3-4% for current deposits and only 7-8% for fixed deposits. Since interest rates are so low, why not try to make profits themselves instead of depositing in the bank? This statement is not entirely true. Although bank interest rates are low, they are more stable than risky speculative businesses. Why should banks passively restrict speculation by appropriately increasing lending rates? It is impossible to analyze and not give to depositors, and they are unwilling to actively encourage savings.

I think there are two ways to increase interest rates: (A) The government guarantees interest, and the government bears part of the increased interest to show preferential treatment. This deposit can be jointly used by the government and the bank to transfer floating funds to the mainland and concentrate production. (B) Promote profit sharing. In addition to the prescribed interest, the bank uses it on behalf of depositors and distributes the remaining profits to depositors. In this way, depositors have no risk of speculation, but have fixed benefits. It is really a win-win situation.

(2) The bank itself also engages in speculative business. Some people think that the bank itself also undertakes this kind of speculative business, such as hoarding goods and buying foreign exchange. It is better for them to do it themselves than for the bank to do it. Fortunately, the bank will profit, and the interest rate will not be increased. If they are unlucky enough to lose, the foundation will be shaken, and the impact will inevitably affect depositors. Therefore, depositing is harmful and not beneficial. This statement seems to have a reasonable reason at first glance; however, after careful examination of the content, it is not entirely true. Not to mention that banks are properly supervised by the government and cannot engage in speculation indiscriminately; even if they occasionally buy and sell foreign exchange, they have their own uses, which are by no means comparable to those of ordinary speculators! And they can choose a bank with stable operations and deposit in it. If the bank handles profit-sharing deposits, its funds are no different from being managed by the bank, so the reliability is even greater than that of individuals.

(3) Restrictions on withdrawals. Some people think that since the government had restrictions on withdrawals on August 13 and the "Ma Telegram" later, they are afraid that if they deposit in the bank, they will become stagnant once they are restricted. Not to mention that the government will never do this again in the future, even if they do, they are only depositing their surplus funds in the bank to earn interest. They only need to use the interest income to maintain their daily expenses, so why bother about this point.

People's selfishness is inherent in human nature and does not need to be concealed. Moreover, for the sake of preserving personal assets, hoarding goods and competing to buy foreign exchange, etc., may have their own unavoidable difficulties. However, can holding foreign exchange, stocks, goods, tungsten ore, etc., really ensure their personal assets? This is questionable, and I will briefly describe the reasons:

(1) Foreign exchange: In today's turbulent European situation, who can guarantee the value of various foreign exchanges and the extent to which it can be maintained? Who did not cherish and value the pound in the past? What about today? The US dollar, which is valued by all parties today, was the currency that everyone trusted the least in 1933. Moreover, who can be sure that the United States can maintain its neutral position? If they think that the position of foreign exchange is always more stable than that of legal tender, this is a completely unreasonable view. Indeed, the decline in exchange rates and the rise in prices are no different from the devaluation of legal tender. However, world prices are rising uniformly; the value of any foreign currency is also depreciating uniformly. It should be known that today's soaring prices are the inevitable impact of the war. Therefore, hoarding legal tender is as dangerous as hoarding foreign exchange; moreover, China's war of resistance has dragged on to this day, and the Japanese economy is on the verge of collapse. Today, they are eagerly seeking peace, and they do not hesitate to set up puppets themselves to make peace, rather than waiting for China to admit defeat. The state of their embarrassment can be imagined. This is especially revealing that the future of legal tender is bright. Moreover, the current foreign exchange has been reduced to the lowest level. According to the international balance of payments, there is absolutely no reason for it. The current international payment exceeds more than three times the previous one. It can be imagined from this that the current unreasonable decline in the exchange rate is inevitable in the future.

(2) Stocks: Stock prices have risen to the highest peak, or have exceeded several times the face value, or even exceeded ten times. However, if you try to see whether the dividends that should be obtained are also several or more than ten times, you will be clear. According to the general intention of buying stocks, they think that these stocks are not low in dividends and are relatively stable. However, the property rights are all controlled by foreign merchants, and the Chinese people cannot intervene. If it is profitable, why would they sell it? Moreover, their prices are mostly calculated in legal tender, which is contradictory.

(3) Tungsten ore: Tungsten ore will definitely be purchased by the government in the future. It cannot be privately exported, nor can it be privately sold for profit. As for the purchase price, it will certainly not be consistent with the recent black market price. If they buy it at a high price today and sell it at a low price at that time, they will inevitably suffer considerable losses.

(4) Goods: If the hoarding of goods is excessive, once foreign exchange is slightly loosened and foreign loans are imported one after another, or if foreigners dump them, the prices will plummet, even at present. Moreover, even if the market price rises, it is a market without a market. If they are not in the industry, they cannot sell at the market price. Sitting and consuming warehouse rent and interest, the result may be more harm than good.

I think that at this time, if they can ship domestic native products to the mainland for export and exchange for foreign exchange, it is really the best way. On the one hand, the government can develop foreign trade, and on the other hand, individuals can also obtain profits. Moreover, there are many maritime people from all over the world, and there must be many products from their hometowns. There may not be few people who are familiar with this way. Instead of competing to accumulate, why not find another source?

In short, in this extraordinary period, hoarding goods and competing to buy foreign exchange are not the way to preserve assets and increase income. It is better to accumulate legal tender and accumulate thrift. Hoarding legal tender has the indirect preparation of full production and the direct preparation of existing funds and guarantees. Depositing in the bank also has considerable interest to be taken. What is the most stable method, why bother to enter the trap, be used by others, and take useless actions with limited energy and material assets? Banks should also have corresponding measures at this time to curb speculative actions, such as refusing to make speculative loans, etc.

National Tung Oil Purchased for Export

Tung oil is now one of the state-run export commodities. In the first ten months of last year, the total amount of tung oil purchased and exported by the Trade Commission reached 32,000 metric tons, which is equivalent to 720,000 dan in the city system. As for the region of its acquisition, it is as shown in the following table. (Note) According to the "Industrial and Commercial News" monthly magazine in Chongqing. Unit: metric tons.

### Price Index of Chongqing City

According to the price index compiled by the Southwest Economic Construction Research Institute: The prices in the wartime capital have indeed increased sharply, but compared with Shanghai, it seems that they are still not as good as each other.

Year 26 Year 27 Year 28 End of Year 28

(Note) The above three paragraphs are the average for June of each year; the last paragraph is November of Year 28.

It can be seen from this that food prices have increased the slowest; because they are local products, they should not be compared with those that have foreign exchange relations. Nowadays, Shanghai rice merchants openly say that since foreign rice has risen, domestic rice should also follow the rise. Their intentions can be known!

Commercial News

### North-South Cargo: Black Dates Sell Well

Recently, black dates have been cheap in the market and vendors are very active. A total of more than 2,000 packages have been opened. The better quality cargo sells for 31-32 yuan, the second grade for 30 yuan, and second-grade dates for 27-28 yuan to 29 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Market Stabilizes

Yesterday, the sugar market stabilized due to the closure of the border and the value of the week, so the trend was stable and transactions were clear. The association made a list of prices: the current price of second-grade coarse sugar white spot goods at this store was 62.24 yuan, and new goods at the foreign store were 62 yuan. Taikoo Chebai was called lower by 12 cents. HX Ma's new goods at the Xizhan store were selling for 67.6 yuan, and HX Ma at the Xizhan store was selling for 63.9 yuan.

### Coal: Cooked Coal Raised in Dark Market

The cooked coal market continues to rise. In fact, all parties on this street are collecting it very closely, and because the supply is insufficient for distribution, the black market is exceptionally strong. The same industry line is broken, and it has been called 180 yuan to be delivered, and they still want to add more labor. Therefore, the retail price of each door shop has been raised across the board, 25 yuan per unit, and 10 yuan is sold per 100 city pounds.

### Hardware: Yellow Steel Wire: Factory Demand is Still Lively

Yellow steel wire, which has been silent for a long time, showed a slight turnaround yesterday. The spring factory, thermos bottle factory, and iron bed, etc. on this street successively moved to do business and bought more than 200 loads. Therefore, the market is still called lively, and people's hearts have also been revived. The standard sales disk has also been raised by about 1 yuan. The current market price of flowers is 35 yuan per load, the middle-grade goods are called 40 yuan per load, and the fine color is sold for about 45 yuan per load.

Sexual Health

### The Changing Affection of Women

— Yang Daonan, graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

Impact on Husband's Strength and Vigor

If the combination of two sexes cannot harmonize the personalities of both sides, the feelings are often not good. However, the preservation of a woman's love is always shifted by her own desires, so a woman's love is most likely to change. The one she gives her great love to today, once the feeling changes, it is not difficult to regard them as hateful people. The background of love is purely the satisfaction of carnal desires. If a man cannot satisfy a woman's desires, he is in danger of being abandoned by her. People often say that a woman's desires are entirely dominated by vanity, but they do not know that in addition to material vanity, there is also the enjoyment of carnal desire. German physiologist Mr. Weismann said: "The life of a woman is a sexual life, and the thoughts and feelings of a woman are entirely motivated by sexual desire." This is indeed the truth. Looking at a woman who is loved, no matter how happy she is in life, if her husband cannot satisfy her desires, she often does not abide by women's morals and looks for another partner outside. This is a major motivation for women to commit adultery, which is also what those who study women's psychology must know.

Therefore, as a husband, one should always pay attention to the health of his reproductive function. Those who have had spermatorrhea, seminal emission, or impotence should seek medical attention as soon as possible. It should be known that this kind of disease is mostly caused by early masturbation and indulgence. If it is not treated and made worse, the organization of love between the two sides will taste like wax, and the feelings will be like ice and charcoal. Love cannot last forever, not to mention that the disease will extend to the whole body, such as pale complexion, stunted development, back pain, forgetfulness and insomnia, loss of erectile power, and even complete impotence. The various distressing diseases cannot be described in detail, so early treatment is a necessary step. Now that medicine has advanced, German physiologist Dr. Mellen has learned from 30 years of research that this disease is completely due to the rupture of the gonads that dominate sexual desire, and invented the "Bodytone," a genuine male-strengthening animal gonadal preparation, with phosphorus to nourish the brain, iron to nourish the blood, and calcium to nourish the bones. After taking it, the spirit is rejuvenated, and impotence dissipates in an instant. The medicine is effective and nourishes the kidneys 24 hours after taking it. Therefore, the efficacy is the crown of all endocrine preparations. Her female "Bodytone" is an ovarian endocrine preparation that regulates menstruation and seed production and is a good gynecological medicine.

### Youth's Wet Dreams Without Dreams

— Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine from Germany

Treatment of Nocturnal Emission During the Day

Spermatorrhea should be divided into dream and dreamless. Dream emission is less harmful than dreamless emission, but spermatorrhea is more harmful than dreamless emission. The method of treatment should also respond to its causes. If it is caused by excessive masturbation, then it is appropriate to first abstain from masturbation. If it comes from荒淫, then it is especially appropriate to be temperate in desire and nourish life. Pay attention to the various sperm-consolidating drugs on the market, all of which advocate consolidating the sperm gate, and must not be taken indiscriminately. The ingredients contained in this type of drug all contain toxic substances that anesthetize the ejaculation center and paralyze the sperm gate. Its ability to achieve temporary success relies on this anesthetic ingredient. Its harm is as ridiculous as using morphine to quit opium addiction, and the abuses are endless. It must be known that drinking鸩to quench thirst is not done by the wise, so the best treatment should be to take medicine and health care in parallel. All stimulating cigarettes, alcohol and other products should be quit, and the body should not be overworked. If you can rub the area with cold water for ten minutes before going to bed, it will be very effective if you can continue to do it for a long time. It is also appropriate to take "Nairs Spermatorrhea Tablets", only three tablets before going to bed, which can completely stop spermatorrhea. This product has absolutely no side effects, does not damage digestive function, and has no disadvantages if taken for a long time. This is the祭酒in spermatorrhea medicine, and has been popular for more than 20 years. No matter how fierce spermatorrhea is, it has the effect of taking effect that night. If the body is too weak, then combine it with the German endocrine preparation "Bodytone" to make up for the loss. The effect of taking the two medicines together is like a god.

### New Estimates of Chemical Therapy for Gonorrhea

— Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine from the United States

Chemotherapy is the latest term for the most recently invented treatment for淋. However, there are pros and cons, and there are no completely perfect results without disadvantages. Therefore, many doctors and patients hesitate and doubt because of its large reaction, and dare not apply it. This certainly has considerable reason. However, with the progress of science, this defect can be improved. The one who has achieved the most in researching gonorrhea treatment is the German gonorrhea master Dr. Peter. Dr. Peter's thinking is progressive. All kinds of effective treatments for淋have been tested, and finally, for chemical therapy, he felt that it does have special effects on the treatment of淋, but it is necessary to improve its bad ingredients and have no reaction. Therefore, Dr. Peter went one step further and invented a specially made chemical therapy drug "New Clinon". This agent has a very strong bactericidal power. After taking it, there is no adverse reaction in the part of the drug that passes through the stomach and intestines. The reason is that this agent is purely refined and does not contain toxic substances, so there is no adverse reaction. However, its power to kill淋bacteria is unusually strong, reaching the lesion directly without harming its healthy tissue, and it is not like general chemical therapy, which has severe reactions, causing the complexion to turn blue. Only "New Clinon" has absolutely no such reaction, because its bactericidal power is thorough, so regardless of the symptoms of acute淋at the beginning or various symptoms of gonorrhea when it turns into chronic淋. Taking "New Clinon" has the certainty of rapid cure without leaving bad sequelae. In my many years of clinical experience, only after the two drugs "New Clinon" were introduced can it be called the highest peak of chemical therapy. And this kind of special medicine has won the unanimous encouragement and appreciation of doctors all over the world. ("New Clinon" Zhengwei and Taihe are both sold)

### Gonorrhea Lecture

— Doctor Yao Ju

Outpatient Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road

The Relationship between Seasonality and Bacteria: There is a great relationship between seasonality and the survival of bacteria. Therefore, many seasonal diseases are quite rampant in their five seasons, and are rarely seen in a certain season. This is probably because of the twelve points of relationship with the effectiveness of climate activities. Now let's take the activities of淋bacteria as an example. The transmission of gonorrhea is certainly not limited to climate and seasonality, but it cannot be said that the activities of淋bacteria have nothing to do with climate. Now that spring returns to the earth and everything is thriving, we humans are also more active in action than in the cold season because of the spring sunshine. Therefore, the long-dormant淋bacteria will inevitably take the opportunity to move out and wreak havoc, so there are many chronic淋that have not healed, which often have to break out again in the spring. The reason is here. There is also another reason. It is also an element for the肆of gonorrhea, that is, five people are more in need of love in the spring than in other seasons. Therefore, it is also the main cause of the transmission of gonorrhea.

Easily Cured Opportunity: However, the story should be turned around. This season when淋bacteria are most active is also the season when gonorrhea is most easily cured. Because at this time,淋bacteria that have been久longing to move have a tendency to attack the nest. Therefore, taking advantage of its complete activity to make a thorough eradication is really a matter of killing several birds with one stone. According to my experience, the gonorrhea holy medicine "New Clinon" (available at Wing On Company) is the best. Because the bactericidal effect of "New Clinon" is meticulous, it is even more useful to use German electrostatic therapy and X-ray electrotherapy alternately. As a result, the latent淋bacteria are quickly extinguished, so the New Year season is indeed the best opportunity to eradicate gonorrhea, so please do not miss this opportunity.

Consultation hours: 10 am to 6 pm. Starting today, 20 numbers will be sent for consultation every day, and each number will only cost 50 cents.

### Hemoptysis Should Be Cured Quickly

— Sheng Zaiqiang, Physician

Regarding hemoptysis due to tuberculosis, the blood vessels in the diseased part are fragile, and hemoptysis symptoms are caused by the sudden rupture of the pulse tubes due to exercise and coughing. Tuberculosis is a chronic disease, and the changes of all diseases go through a very slow process. However, hemoptysis is a sudden event, so effective treatment must be carried out, and absolute negligence is not allowed. However, in theory and experience, hemoptysis is not absolutely a critical illness. However, it cannot be regarded as a minor symptom. According to my many years of experience, in terms of internal medicine, "Lung Tonic" is the most effective. Not only can hemoptysis be cured, but the source of hemoptysis can also be cured. I said that the merger of lung disease and hemoptysis is not terrible, and the reason is here. Moreover, "Lung Tonic" has the miraculous effect of killing lung tuberculosis bacteria, so it is the most effective internal medicine for lung disease and hemoptysis.

### Japan's Increased Production Policy Expected to Fail

The shortage of raw materials and manpower has shattered the Japanese government's increased production policy. According to a survey by the Japanese Toyo Keizai Shinpo Sha, Japan's industrial and mining production index reached its peak in August last year and then began to collapse. The table is as follows: (Showa 6 (converted to percentage in the eighth year)

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### Food Belief and Longevity

— Sun Xian Dao Cheng

At the refugee relief art performance conference hosted by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Township Group Fundraising Committee yesterday at the Broadway Concert Hall, Dr. Ding Fubao publicly elaborated on the method of longevity. The main skills related to the two major elements of food and accommodation are recorded in this publication. (What Mr. Ding said below) The most important condition for longevity is to have a suitable diet. As the saying goes, disease enters through the mouth. It can be said that food has a great relationship with human life. It is better to follow the example of German leader Hitler's abstinence from meat, smoking and drinking. The above items contain very tiny toxic substances, and long-term consumption is easy to be poisoned. It is best to eat brown rice, vegetables, soybeans and other items every day because these items contain rich nutrients. Salt is especially suitable to be reduced, and should not be eaten too much. Fruits are beneficial to the human body, and it is okay to eat more. This can avoid hardening of blood vessels, high blood pressure, nephritis, liver disease, etc. Also, all foods should be chewed slowly and swallowed slowly, and it is especially important to eat less. At most, eat to 70% or 80% of your appetite, and do not eat too full. Ms. Lu Bicheng, a senior member of the Chinese education community, said that the world may worry that vegetarianism is unhygienic, but it is actually a misunderstanding. Her English friend told her that vitamins are divided into five categories A, B, C, D, and F in fresh fruits and vegetables, which are the most essential for health preservation and can cure various diseases. They are found in almost all fruits and vegetables. The greatness of its nourishing power cannot be compared with the dead corpses of animals. Eating meat is harmful and can cause various diseases. Smoking and drinking not only consume money, but are also not suitable for health. In the past, the rice and wheat in our country were pounded with stone mortars and ground with stone mills. Although they were rough, they were hygienic. Since the invention of rice milling machines, valuable nutrients have been completely removed. The reason why people in cities are not as healthy as people in rural areas is also related to the fineness of the rice they eat. The above is about food. As for housing, in addition to sufficient sunshine and fresh air, the best sleeping time every night is 9 pm, and you should get up at dawn. When sleeping, you should lie on your right side in the first half of the night, and lie on your left side in the second half of the night, because the lower mouth of the stomach must be inclined to the right side in the first half of the night, so that the food staying in the stomach can easily enter the duodenum and be transported to the small intestine, so it is advisable to lie on the right side. Other things such as exercise can get the mean, the spirit can be quiet, not greedy, not looking for troubles, and things that cannot be told to others should not be done. In short, the Confucian school is cautious and alone, then you will have longevity. Now the general sons on the isolated island are all happy at night and sleep during the day, which is equivalent to killing their lives. It's a pity!

### Talking About Shoes

— Shen Xishen

In recent years, people in cities, regardless of men or women, like to wear leather shoes. Except for women wearing high heels that are not worth learning from, a person who wears leather shoes seems to be able to invigorate their spirits when walking and working. At the same time, they seem to be more imposing!

However, recently Shanghai has seen soaring prices in everything. To buy a pair of middle-to-upper-class leather shoes, I am afraid that it will cost no less than twenty or thirty yuan. Even if it is a little lower, it will cost about ten yuan. Therefore, all those who wear leather shoes should pay special attention to saving their leather shoes in the future. For example, when at home or in the office, you may as well buy a pair of cloth shoes to wear. When going out, change into leather shoes. This adjustment can also save some money!

I heard that people in the interior are wearing cloth shoes because of the high prices. I think Shanghai people can also follow suit. A pair of women's shoes with wool woven uppers and red leather soles on the market now costs five or six yuan. Young people walk heavily, and often a pair of shoes can only be worn for one or two months before they break. This is really too uneconomical! Why not change to cloth shoes? They are both simple and comfortable.

### You Can't Live Without Bamboo

— Ai Li

The ancients said it well: "You would rather eat without meat than live without bamboo." It can be seen that the ancients loved bamboo deeply. Wherever they lived, they had to plant a few bamboos to feel elegant. Bamboo is one of the most valuable things among plants. It can be eaten and grown. Therefore, rural families often have a bamboo garden, which is a great help in terms of production. I have always loved bamboo. In my old home in my hometown, I also planted dozens of bamboos. I like to watch the new green of the bamboo leaves, and I like to listen to the sound of rain on the bamboo tips. And when the spring bamboo shoots are budding, I have to borrow them as appetizers, so my feelings for bamboo are too good. I really can't live without this gentleman for a day. However, since my hometown fell into enemy hands, I have never gone back and have been separated from the bamboo garden for a long time. I can't even think about eating bamboo shoots. In recent years, I have been cramped on the sea, living on the third floor of someone else's house. Opening the window, I can only see the cliffs or windows of my neighbors on the left, right, front, and back. I can't even see a tree, let alone a bamboo garden. The old saying of the ancients "You can't live without bamboo" has long been overturned. However, my love for bamboo is too deep. Although there is no bamboo garden where I live, I still have to buy one or two potted small bamboos to serve as a clear offering on my desk, and I also have to hang a few ancient bamboo paintings on the wall for appreciation. Even the appetizers for these few days must be bamboo shoots. Yesterday, after drinking, I had nothing to do and went to the Da Xin Company to visit the calligraphy and painting exhibition of Old Man Fen. Old Man Fen's calligraphy has long been famous. Whether it is official script, cursive script, seal script, or clock鼎stone drum script, he writes well. But I have never seen his paintings before. I heard that he has dozens of bamboo paintings this time, so I went to see them specially. After seeing them, I couldn't help but admire him. It turned out that his bamboos, whether sparse or dense, were all refined and detached. He was simply looking up to Wen Yuke and Xia Zhongzhao's halls. Taoist Banqiao is really not worth mentioning. I have heard old gentlemen say that whoever writes well will definitely paint bamboo well. Old Man Fen's calligraphy is good, so it is no wonder that he can paint many good bamboo heads as soon as he starts. The poems are mostly written by Old Man Fen himself. I love one of them the most: (Looking west at Kuizhou, I am saddened, Don't feel ashamed that you have no power to repay涓, A branch is sent to express the meaning in front of the wind, It is originally known that arrows are needed for killings.) After chanting again and again, I feel that Lu Fangweng is a little far away from the people. I think in the shortest possible time, I will ask Old Man Fen to wave his如橡pen and paint a stone and a few techniques of bamboo for me, and then inscribe this poem and match it with a square mirror frame so that it can be hung in my碧玟玕阁. I know that when the wind comes in the middle of the night, there will be a rustling sound coming from the back of the paper.

### Two New Weapons for Land Transportation

— Liu Yun

In recent years, the development of the automobile industry in Europe and the United States has really been progressing by leaps and bounds. I heard that a young inventor in the United States has recently invented a "night-light car". That is, the car is coated with a layer of phosphorescent paint, so when it comes to night, the car emits a dazzling light, which can be seen by people even half a mile away!

A Soviet engineer has recently invented that the steam from locomotives can still be returned to the water pot to save the trouble of trains stopping to add water. The method is actually very simple, that is, the steam sprayed out by the locomotive is led to another container, cooled and condensed into water, and then re-injected into the water pot. With such a device, the train can continue to travel for more than four or five hundred miles.

### The Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation of a Perfect Couple

— Traveler's View

In the past, during the era of monarchs, people had only one path to success. Talented individuals from across the country gathered in the imperial court, leading to a "hydrocephalic" nation with an overdeveloped brain and underdeveloped limbs. Therefore, the "perfect life" was merely defined by the six characters "wealth, honor, and longevity." Such outdated notions are, of course, extremely unsuitable for a later age of scientific progress and democratic evolution. Fellow countrymen who aspire to a happy life should first understand what constitutes a perfect and happy man and woman in other countries. I have exhausted my life's efforts, yet I have not only failed to benefit my countrymen, but also do not know how to seek happiness for myself. Recently, American newspapers have held a grand competition to find the perfect couple. If our country could emulate this, it would deeply correct mistaken societal views, open up new avenues for national progress, and allow us to consider economic conditions and enjoy regulated and planned leisure activities, thereby creating countless perfect and happy families throughout China.

The main conditions for the American newspapers' so-called "perfect couple" are based on four questions, soliciting responses widely:

(1) The husband must be ambitious and have excellent qualities, while the wife must be harmonious, beautiful, and have no occupation. (Note: This emphasizes "completeness," not that women should not have occupations.)

(2) The husband's income should be at least US$1,500 per year. (Note: The cost of living in the United States is remarkably high; an annual income of US$1,500 is nearly the lowest salary for a married man, equivalent to a monthly salary of eighty yuan for a National Government employee when the exchange rate had not yet fallen.)

(3) The wife must be skilled at cooking.

(4) They must have three children, ideally two boys and one girl.

Subsequently, tens of thousands of written responses were received from readers. After detailed examination by the editorial staff, the "standard perfect couple" selected as the first-place winner was the McDonnell family from Gainesville, Florida, who had been married for ten years and had a monthly income of US$200. The husband is 35 years old, the wife is 31 years old, and they currently have two sons. The elder son is named Washington, and the younger son is named Theodore. In their ten years of marriage, they have only quarreled once. It is said that their disagreement stemmed from differing opinions on the naming of their elder son. Ultimately, they followed the husband's suggestion and named their eldest son after the first President of the United States. When their younger son was born, they followed the wife's suggestion and named him after the twenty-fifth President, Theodore Roosevelt. Western customs generally avoid imitating others and lagging behind. However, when naming children, they not only fail to have unique "personalities," but also engage in relentless and uncompromising disputes, which is difficult for people from the Far East to understand. The McDonnell family's clothing, food, housing, and transportation are detailed below:

Clothing: The wife spends very little on clothing each year, purchasing only two new outfits and two new hats, all within a specific period during clothing market sales. In European and American families, this is considered extremely frugal, as men's clothing does not undergo frequent style changes and can be carefully maintained for many years without wearing out.

Food: The couple eats at home year-round. However, each week, the wife spends half an afternoon at a tea party with female friends, or hosts a tea party for them at home. The husband spends time in the club once a week. (Europeans also have casual chats with friends, also once a week.) In addition, the husband drinks a glass of whiskey (often mixed with soda water and drunk late at night) every day, and smokes two pouches of tobacco and ten paper-rolled cigarettes. (Note: "Whiskey" is from the Irish language, "Beatha" means life, and "Uisge" means water.)

Housing: They live in a small, elegant house with a garden, but do not hire a maid.

Transportation: They own a car for outings, but do not employ a driver. They go to the cinema once a week, the theater or concert hall once a month, and an exhibition once every three months, or instead of visiting an exhibition, they take a leisurely tour of the museum. Every Sunday, they go out to the gardens and fields for leisure, always with the entire family.

### Weekly Economical Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

In Shanghai, during this difficult time of economic hardship, it goes without saying that chicken, duck, fish, and meat are unaffordable. Even ordinary vegetables, which poor people rely on to eat with rice, have all risen in price. It is truly forcing people to become immortal beings who do not consume earthly food. Speaking of relatively inexpensive vegetables, only yellow bean sprouts and tea bean sprouts are available, each costing about one and a half jiao per catty. After cooking, they can fill two bowls, enough for two meals, day and night. Yellow bean sprouts have a natural freshness, are rich in vitamins, and are very chewy, making them a truly affordable food. When making meat dishes, it is best to braise them with beef slices. First, stir-fry the yellow bean sprouts briefly, then add the beef slices and braise them together. You can add a lot of broth, which is very delicious with rice. If you don't eat beef, you can substitute pork slices, which are also delicious. Tea bean sprouts are also known as silver sprouts. If stir-fried with roasted duck shreds, they can be served at banquets. Usually, they are stir-fried with pork shreds, and should not be overcooked to maintain their crispness. In addition, you can add some chive sprouts or pickled mustard tuber shreds as you like, which also have a unique flavor.

### A Major Problem on the Isolated Island

— Yang Zi

Blacklisted friends, you must: Think while lying down, speak while sitting, and act while standing!

During the days of strict prohibition, at a time of bright spring sunshine, those sinking in the sea of suffering should not delay in quitting their addictions.

"What time is it now?" This is the first question I want to ask my blacklisted compatriots on this isolated island.

The government's consistently proactive anti-opium policy has reached its deadline for cessation this month on the 31st. According to reports, the government authorities are determined to thoroughly enforce it. Starting from April 1st, anyone who smokes opium again will be sentenced to death. Even elderly and sick smokers will be dealt with strictly without exception. It is evident that opium's life has only a few days of lingering breath left. Although smokers on this isolated island, where the government's reach is limited, can still eke out a living for some time, the danger is always great. Just imagine, from next month onwards, smokers will be carrying a terrible death sentence on their backs, wouldn't that be very unsettling? Therefore, during this period, smokers must quit. Now, during this period of gentle breezes and warm sunshine, it is the perfect opportunity to quit smoking. At the same time, land prices are so expensive, rice is so expensive, and all commodity prices are so expensive. Therefore, to resist the torrents of this great era, to establish a foundation for struggle, and to open up a bright future, smokers should not fail to quit during this period. Because smokers cannot but quit during this period, and should not fail to quit, a craze for smoking cessation drugs has formed under a speculative mentality. Those who are determined to quit smoking should be particularly cautious amidst this craze. If money is wasted and the goal of cessation is not achieved, but instead the severity of the drug addiction is increased, harming the entire physical constitution, that is even more unwise than smoking. Therefore, the most important issue in quitting smoking is choosing a good doctor and absolutely avoiding making one's body an experimental product for speculative medicines.

Dr. Lai Gōngliàng of the White Cross Road Hospital has accumulated over ten years of experience in smoking cessation. The number of people who have quit is countless. All the thank-you letters piled high are ironclad proof of his achievements. (Regarding the countless thank-you letters, they could be printed as a special edition, but because Dr. Lai does not like to make exaggerated publicity, he would rather save the advertising fees and reduce the burden on those quitting smoking. If you want to know the truth, you can go to the hospital to browse them.) As for the safety and efficacy of Dr. Lai's smoking cessation methods, the newspapers have consistently published truthful reports in the past. I believe that those who are determined to quit smoking also understand that Dr. Lai's smoking cessation is by no means comparable to that of quacks. During the cessation process, work continues as usual, the spirit is even better than when smoking, the addiction is broken unconsciously, and there is never a relapse after quitting. These are the four most prominent characteristics of Dr. Lai's smoking cessation: (1) sound sleep, (2) smooth bowel movements, (3) refreshed spirit, and (4) increased appetite. Anyone who has been treated by Dr. Lai is willing to guarantee it with their character, because Dr. Lai takes full responsibility for helping people quit smoking and guarantees safe cessation. For example, I am one of those who had their smoking habit broken by Dr. Lai. Because smokers have the greatest tendency to be lazy, I am specifically reminding smokers that they really cannot be lazy anymore during this period. The address of the Public Health Hospital is at 208 White Cross Road in the British Concession. The telephone number is 9521. If you have any questions about smoking cessation, please inquire at the Public Health Hospital in person. There are also trial service measures to demonstrate the value.

Spring and Autumn

### In Memory of Mr. Cai Yuanpei

— Zhang Yimo

Mr. Cai and I were born in the same year and month, but he was eleven days older than me. Last year, on the seventeenth day of the old lunar calendar, his disciple Mr. Yu Tianmin came to visit and said, "Today is Mr. Cai's birthday. He is not entertaining outside guests, but because you are an old friend, he has specially invited you to chat at noon." On that day, Mrs. Cai hosted a feast, and the only guests present were Mr. Cai's nephew Cai Taichong and his wife, a Mr. Qi, and Tianmin, as well as the host and hostess. Last month, I visited him two or three times again for some matters. I never imagined he would leave the world so quickly. At lunch the day before his death, he ate heartily as usual. In the afternoon, he bent over to pick something up and stumbled, then spat out purple blood. The doctor said it was a gastric ulcer. He was carried to the Yanghe Hospital, where his limbs were cold and his breath was barely perceptible. His nephew transfused him with four bowls of blood. Soon his hands and feet twitched, but his speech was already slurred. He passed away at 9:45 the next morning. Mr. Chen Binhe took care of his funeral arrangements and informed me of his illness, also asking me to write a brief account for historical materials. Since I did not bid farewell to Mr. Cai, I will record my friendship and feelings for him. As Ouyang Xiu said, "Regretting for the world above, and mourning for his personal loss below."

Mr. Cai passed the imperial examination in the gengyin year and entered the Hanlin Academy. His examination papers were examined by Wang Haoyin, an elder from my hometown. He found the first paper unusual, not resembling the stereotyped eight-legged essay. But the second and third papers were incredibly erudite, so he recommended all three papers and praised him. I heard this from Wang Haoyin's sons, Jilie and Jitong.

During the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, Mr. Cai was a teacher at Nanyang Public School. When student movements arose, he established Patriotic Schools and was recommended as their leader. At that time, the authorities aimed to suppress student movements. Soon, Mr. Cai and eight other gentlemen, including Wu Zhihui, Zhang Taiyan, and the Monk of Wumu Mountain, were wanted. He went abroad and joined Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance).

In the guimao year, I was sent to Zhili as a special candidate recommended by a provincial graduate, and was appointed as a reserve county magistrate in the Beiyang government. Mr. Cai was overseas, and I did not have the opportunity to meet him. During the Xinhai Revolution, when Sun Yat-sen became President, Mr. Cai headed the Ministry of Education. When Sun Yat-sen ceded the presidency to Yuan Shikai, the Tongmenghui cabinet resigned en masse and went into retirement.

When Mr. Cai entered the Ministry of Education, he appointed Fan Jingsun as the Director-General. Members of the Ministry, such as Xia Zengyou and Lu Xun, were all talented individuals, and he did not use party affiliation as a standard. The regulations he drafted were universally accepted as groundbreaking for the Republic of China. In the fourth year of the Republic (1915), I became the Minister of Education because I advised against the imperial system. I followed Mr. Cai's principles. I saw in the files of the National Language Unification Association that representatives from twenty provinces, including Mongolia and Tibet, were gathered in one place to standardize the language. Before it could be implemented, I requested the establishment of a Phonetic Alphabet Training Institute. This was the beginning of the Ministry of Education's National Language Unification Association. Mr. Cai was the president, and Mr. Wu Zhihui and I were his deputies. The promotion of the national language in various provinces, and the textbook revisions to vernacular Chinese after the eighth year of the Republic (1919), were all initiated by Mr. Cai. When Fan Jingsun was the Minister, he deplored the corruption of Peking University and changed it to an independent system, appointing Mr. Cai as its president. Mr. Cai invited Wang Guowei, Gu Hongming, and Liu Shipei to lecture on classical literature, and Hu Shi, Qian Xuantong, and Chen Duxiu to lecture on modern literature, bringing all factions together in one furnace. He was like a river that accepts all small streams, allowing different paths to coexist without conflict, and nurturing all things without harm. How great he was!

During the May Fourth Movement, the government surrounded Peking University students with soldiers. Mr. Cai had Jiang Menglin act as the acting president and left a note on his desk, saying, "The one who killed your horse is a passerby on the road." He then secretly left. Thereafter, when people spoke of academic atmosphere, the old school focused their criticism on Mr. Cai's laissez-faire attitude, while the new school regarded it as the first sign of Chinese students saving the country. Dr. John Dewey of the United States was lecturing in Beijing at the time, and believed that the student movement could represent a new awakening (Dewey's lecture collection). Impartial judgment will be left to future generations.

Between the sixth and seventh years of the Republic (1917-1918), U.S. Minister Reinsch and Mr. Xiong Bingsan were the presidents of the Sino-American Association. Mr. Cai, Mr. Wang Liangchou, and I were all members of the Association, which met twice a month. In the eleventh year of the Republic (1922), Mr. Cai returned to Shanghai from Europe. Mr. Huang Renzhi and I welcomed him together. Mr. Cai said that there must be free assembly organizations in the country, and that is why the National Affairs Conference was held, with Mr. Yu Rizhang recommended as president. Ultimately, it ceased operations due to a lack of funding. The Tang (Shaoyi) and Zhu (Qiqian) North-South peace talks followed, and Sun Yat-sen's northern expedition declaration followed, but ultimately they did not achieve unification.

After the success of the Northern Expedition, Mr. Cai was a member of the Central Supervisory Committee and the Director of the Academia Sinica. During this time, I had the opportunity to travel to Yushan Mountain at the invitation of Chang Yihuai and Pang Diancai, and I shared lodging with Mr. Cai. That's why I sent him a poem last year, saying: "Even more solid after Yushan, we rejoiced together amidst the songs of triumph." In the future, when I revisit Yushan Mountain, I will pour wine to toast Mr. Cai's spirit and sing songs of triumph in his honor.

After the August 23rd Incident (1937), Mr. Cai went to Hong Kong in disguise, using the pseudonym Zhou Ziyu. The following May, when I moved to Hong Kong, I visited him and learned that he had undergone foot surgery at the German Hospital in the former capital. Later, he had another surgery in Hong Kong, making walking difficult. Because of the New Writing Movement, Mr. Cai and President Sun Zhesheng had a declaration of over seven hundred people, and he agreed to be the honorary chairman, and we consulted him frequently. His wife, Mrs. Zhou Yanghao, took meticulous care of his daily life, and they also enjoyed composing poetry together. Two months ago, Mr. Cai told me: "Cataracts have grown in both eyes, and doctors advise surgery, but because of my old age, I haven't had the operation." Another doctor said not to operate, but to wash them with medicinal water. It is inconvenient to read under the lamp now. Recently, I have received several poems from him, and I should have them cast in zinc plates to preserve his last writings.

Mr. Cai treated everyone equally and never showed anger. He approached everything with a research attitude. The Song Dynasty people said: "Seeing Cheng Mingdao is like sitting in a spring breeze"; he had this quality. He loved to learn and think deeply, and he always had a book in his hand. He taught himself Latin when he was old, and after going abroad, he thoroughly learned German, English, Japanese, and French. He opened newspapers every day in Hong Kong, so he was well-informed about the situation even without leaving his house. Whether people knew him or not, they regarded him as a towering figure, but they were unable to learn his profound nature. His spirit will forever remain between heaven and earth, as a model for a democratic nation. Mr. Cai took national love and equality as his guiding principles, and lamented the lack of universal national education, and that the "rickshaw" of Chinese characters could not reach the masses, so he loudly called for the New Writing. During this period of resistance and nation-building, the government surely cherishes the older generation and will complete Mr. Cai's legacy to benefit four hundred and fifty million people. Mr. Cai can now rest in peace.

### Thoughts on Reading "Ninety-Nine Price Hikes"

— Chu

After Ba Jin proposed a movement to increase manuscript fees, I read an article titled "Ninety-Nine Price Hikes." The title seems humorous, but the author's pen is not humorous at all, and just like my "Thoughts After Reading," I feel endless pain. The poverty of writers has been a fact since ancient times, and "poverty leading to excellent work" seems to be the most honorable compliment. But now is not the time to "store it away on a famous mountain." If there are still bookworms like those in the imperial examination era, reading behind closed doors and writing late into the night, then their poverty is deserved, because those "articles" that only have form but no content, even if they are "excellent," are worthless. Since the War of Resistance, the work of writers with their pens has not lagged behind. On the front lines, in the rear, and even in the occupied areas, they have not forgotten their responsibilities, promoting the true value of words. Chairman Chiang said that elementary school teachers teaching children in classrooms are no different from soldiers in the trenches on the front lines. The power that the writers gave to the war effort was an indelible value. However, the poverty of writers is now so extreme that even the opportunity of elementary school teachers' appeals for a salary raise is not there for them. The sympathy that society gives them is far below that of elementary school teachers. Ba Jin is still a famous writer (this does not mean that "famous" and "unknown" are used to distinguish writers), so the lives of other unknown writers can be imagined!

At this time, publishing articles, although a small hope for monetary value, is the only way writers can make a living through words. Therefore, my "thoughts" also hopes that general merchants, newspaper and magazine publishers, will have "thoughts" too.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 22: News Travels from Afar; Revered Discussions are Human Beliefs

After the paper plates are made in the paper plate room, they are sent to the casting room next to the casting furnace. The paper plate room has six paper plate making machines, so twelve pages of news can be made at the same time. The casting room also has melting furnaces, equipped to cast lead plates simultaneously. Because the lower part of each melting furnace has a pipe opening, the lead liquid can be injected into the casting mold with a single turn. After it is opened, it becomes a semi-circular full-page lead type, which can be placed on the machine's drum. As they walked out of there, Shao Huihua said: "There is a small paper warehouse here, you can also take a look, fortunately that warehouse is never closed." This is a nearly underground room. Although Shao Huihua said it was just a small warehouse for stacking paper, it can also store six hundred rolls of large paper rolls. Because according to Shao Huihua, there is another large warehouse, but it is outside the building, not inside the building. In addition, several special Chinese paper mills can also deposit there, and ship goods at any time. This paper warehouse is only for several days or a week. From the paper warehouse to the machine room, there are two small electric railway tracks, which are specially used for transporting paper rolls. Transporting paper rolls does not require manpower. Just put the whole piece on a flat car, follow this track, and automatically push it to the rotary press. There are two workers next to it who are in charge of the paper pieces. The paper roll is placed on the tube in a row, and when one tube is used up, another one is attached to it. The connection is so fast. In the paper warehouse, we just looked at it. To see them working actively, it is best to come in the middle of the night. Coming out of the paper warehouse, they came to the typesetting room. This typesetting room is on the second floor. It is also a large room, and the type cases are arranged very densely. Only some people were already working there, probably setting the daily advertisements, as well as secondary publications and other less important manuscripts, etc., which can be done a little more leisurely. As for the important news, it is not yet time. But the electric lights in the typesetting room were already shining brightly, and work was about to begin. They saw that there were also several skylights leading from the typesetting room to the upper floor. Above each type case, there are double-wire electric baskets that are sent directly to the upper floor through the skylight. Qu Wushuang said: "Our editorial department is on the third floor, and the proofreading room is also on the third floor. So the editorial department sends manuscripts to the typesetting room, which are sent here by electric basket, and the typesetting room sends the manuscripts to the proofreading room after typesetting, which are also sent by electric basket. In this way, the labor of manual running is saved. Otherwise, the place is so big, running back and forth would be very time-consuming. Because the editorial department, the typesetting room, and the proofreading room, this one institution has a close relationship. Also, from the typesetting room to the small proofing room, from the small proofing room to the layout room, from the layout room to the large proofing room, you see, these electric baskets are also installed as densely as spider webs."
