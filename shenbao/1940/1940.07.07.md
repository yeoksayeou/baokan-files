### The Fourth Year of China's Resistance War

Three years ago, on July 7, 1937, the 26th year of the Republic of China, Japanese troops who had penetrated into Hebei Province, China, suddenly provoked Chinese troops stationed at Lugou Bridge and exerted pressure on Beijing and Tianjin in various ways. At that time, it had already been six years since Japan launched violence and forcibly occupied several provinces of China, including Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. In between, in addition to constant small contacts between the armies of the two countries, there was the January 28th Shanghai Incident and the engagements at various passes of the Great Wall. The Shanghai Agreement and the He-Umezu Agreement were successively signed to end local conflicts through local negotiations. Diplomatic channels between the two countries remained open. The Chinese authorities sought peace at the expense of principle, and the Chinese people swallowed their anger, making various attempts, still hoping to find a way to resolve the disputes. When the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, it confirmed Japan's bottomless ambition and absolute lack of hope for reconciliation. Japan again sent a large number of ground troops into Shanhaiguan and a large number of naval vessels to Wusongkou. China made a final attempt through diplomacy, which also proved ineffective. A meeting was held in Lushan, and the consensus was reached to resolutely strive for the independence, integrity, freedom, and survival of the nation, to resolutely endure any painful sacrifice, and to resolutely prepare for a long-term, all-out war of resistance. Not only would the war of resistance be won, with confidence in victory, but also efforts would be made to lay the foundation for the nation's eternal foundation in the cause of national construction. From the Lugou Bridge Incident to the present, it has been exactly three years. Today is its three-year anniversary, the first day of the fourth year.

We revere morality and respect reason. We yearn for morality to become the standard of action between people and between countries, and we yearn for the reason of people and groups to restrain their actions. Unfortunately, this is not the case. War proves that although morality and reason are revered and respected by a part of the people, they are not enough to govern every part of the people. Japan's ambition was brazenly expressed through the means of war. China sought peace at the expense of principle, swallowing its anger for six years before finally having to fight back. The nature of war is barbaric destruction and cruel killing. At the same time, war is also the most rigorous, solemn, extensive, and profound test for mankind. China and Japan have undergone three years of testing and are still being tested. The war is still ongoing, so the results of the test have not yet been announced. However, the gains from the past three years have already shown enough to determine the final outcome.

What has Japan's three-year test shown? Violation of morality, loss of sympathy, and thus complete isolation in the international community. The invasion was unjustified, its words were not justified, and therefore its politics were chaotic. Only now has it been able to intensify its long-unsuccessful so-called one-party movement. The current Prime Minister, Yonai, still has to ask Prince Konoe, the central figure of the one-party movement, to "frankly express his beliefs regarding concrete measures for establishing a new system," revealing the lack of frankness in the past and the lack of mutual trust. The turmoil and panic caused in Japan by wartime price increases and currency inflation illustrate the poverty, unsoundness of the Japanese economy, and the emptiness and bewilderment of the people's hearts. The failure of its military offensives and the futility of its political offensives reveal its outwardly strong but inwardly weak attitude, already at the end of its tether.

What has China's three-year test shown? Comparing Shanghai's three-month resistance in one corner and the three full years of resistance to date with the war in Poland, the war in Finland, the war in Norway, and the so-called great battles on the Western Front in the European war, how do they compare? Comparing them side by side, highlighting the strengths and measuring the weaknesses, the achievements of China's resistance war will surely receive a fair, consistent, and glorious assessment, whether asked of the world or awaited by future generations. This is of course, absolutely, not obtained by luck. The three-year test is not yet over, but reviewing the process can also reveal the trend. Compare this war with the European war, and compare recent events with the past. Comparing the number and speed with which the Japanese army attacked famous cities and towns in the past with the recent battles in southern Henan, central Hubei, northern Hunan, western Jiangxi, and other places, all of which were met with fierce counterattacks by the Hua army and collapsed. In the past, the Hua army had difficulty holding its ground, retreating dozens or hundreds of miles at a time. Recently, they advanced and retreated only a few miles, engaging in repeated battles, like a tug-of-war. As for mobile counter-offensives, the recapture of strongholds, and large-scale strategic encirclements and annihilations, news of victories is frequently reported. This was difficult in the past but has been repeatedly seen recently. The three-year test is not yet over, but comparing recent events with the past, it is clear that Japan's strength is declining day by day, gradually falling into decline, while China's strength is growing day by day, gradually gaining an advantage. This is ironclad evidence, not empty curses and slander on one hand and extravagant hopes on the other. Therefore, in the early stages of China's resistance war, there was a commitment to victory and confidence in victory. Now, we have a firm grasp of victory. This is not obtained by luck. It should be attributed to the great strategy and talent of China's leaders, as well as to their moral influence. It should be attributed to the loyalty, bravery, and self-sacrificing spirit of China's generals and soldiers. It must also be attributed to the Chinese people's understanding that the nation's independence, integrity, freedom, and survival cannot be achieved without striving for final victory, and that striving for final victory requires unity of purpose, collective wisdom, and collective effort, without shying away from any sacrifice, hardship, or suffering. This is something that the Chinese government and people can be proud of, and something that China's friends cannot but admire.

Japan is like that, China is like this. Three years have passed, all of which is magnificent history. The fourth year begins, and this is the stage for China to unleash its highest courage and strive for final victory. Glory fills the future!

### On the 3rd Anniversary of the "July 7th" Incident, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Exhorts the People and Soldiers of the Nation to Enforce Spiritual Mobilization, Keep the National Covenant, Support the Government’s Military, Political and Economic Plans, With the Faith, Endurance, and Determination to Break Through Difficulties, to Create Lasting Happiness for Mankind

Chongqing: On the 3rd Anniversary of the "July 7th" Incident, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued an address to the people and soldiers of the nation, stating that on this important anniversary, he hoped that the people and soldiers would remember the greatness of our Founding Father’s revolutionary strategy, the depth of our ancestors’ heritage so that, when we could not but resist three years ago, we would make the policy to fight hard and become stronger, protect our national personality, and protect the justice of the world. He urged the soldiers and people of the nation to recall the tragic history of the last three years, and everyone to reflect on whether they are worthy of being citizens of this era, worthy of being descendants of the Yellow Emperor and disciples of the Founding Father. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had not ceased to tell the soldiers and the people the truth of the success and failure of this war during these three years. What he has said should be checked with the facts. As we start the fourth year of the War of Resistance, we should evaluate the past, especially the last year, our circumstances and international relations, to realize that the victory is approaching, and the importance of our continued hard work. The banner for the Chinese War of Resistance is clear, and the goal is accurate. It is striving with all our power to preserve the survival of the nation, and independence of the country. We must have the Japanese army fully withdraw outside our borders, and restore our territorial sovereignty and the completeness of administration. We have no intention of harming the Japanese nation, and do not wish to form a deep feud with the innocent people of Japan. Today, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek made the following sincere points to our beloved soldiers and countrymen and must be followed and implemented by all. (A) We must enforce the National Spiritual Mobilization. We must indeed abide by the national covenant, genuinely practice the Three Principles of the People, support the National Government, and understand our obligations, observe discipline, and make the country and the nation the highest goal. The more the world changes, and the more tense the war, we must be more determined and brave. We must establish a solid and unyielding spiritual fortress that can withstand the final victory. (B) We must support the government’s military plans. Everyone must accept military training, enthusiastically enlist in military service, or participate in labor service, to achieve the goal of a nation of soldiers and a nation of workers. All officers and soldiers, especially senior officers, should not be arrogant in victory, nor discouraged in defeat. Strict discipline and accomplish the mission. Whether it is the front or the rear, we must follow the plan to make our existing military foundation more substantial, expand our existing achievements, and make our national army stronger and stronger, so that we will win every battle and take every attack. (C) We must support the government's political plan and take the responsibility of promoting local autonomy and implementing the new county system, laying a genuine foundation for the Five-Power Constitution. This is a necessary work to enrich national strength and concentrate people's strength. For the sake of long-term resistance, and the long-term welfare of the nation, it must be strengthened. Especially the leaders of various parties and organizations, the gentry of various provinces, cities, and towns, and the principals and teachers of large, medium, and small schools, their words and deeds are all models for their compatriots, and they must work together to realize the Three Principles of the People as their own responsibility, unite sincerely, and never change until death. (D) We must support the government's economic plan. The capital, technology, and efforts of compatriots at home and abroad must be concentrated, and production and construction in the rear must be accelerated and realized as soon as possible. We must also be extremely hardworking, absolutely frugal, vigorously promote savings, promote cooperative undertakings, avoid hoarding, and eliminate corruption, so that the land can be used to its fullest extent and goods can flow smoothly. (E) We must trust and support the government's diplomatic policy. Our diplomacy is one that adheres to justice and reason, and promotes credibility and peace. It has remained unchanged since September 18. Since the start of the War of Resistance on July 7, we have determined that all those who sympathize with and aid us are friendly countries. We have adhered to this central idea as our guiding principle, and it remains unchanged to this day. All our people and soldiers must jointly understand this meaning, support this national policy, cherish themselves, strengthen themselves, fulfill their responsibilities, and make our national policy in the War of Resistance win the respect of the world and live up to the expectations of friendly countries, so as to enhance sympathy, cooperate together, and jointly establish peace in the Far East and the world. Soldiers, compatriots, now is the time when victory is approaching, and it is also the most critical stage of our struggle. We must not forget the ancient teaching of accumulating soil to make a mountain of nine ren. We must understand the principle of fighting harder as we fight. We must endure the current difficulties with a spirit of self-respect and self-confidence. We must break through all difficulties with the determination to succeed or die. We must promote the great power of the Chinese nation from these difficulties, and create lasting happiness for China and all mankind. We unite, we work hard, we persevere, and we will certainly complete the sacred mission entrusted to us by history. (6th dispatch)

The people of the whole country will never forget this and here, we would like to frankly inform our friendly countries of two more important points. First, regarding Japan’s recent threats to the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, and Burma to achieve its aims without fighting, our friendly countries must adopt a clear, fair, stern, and resolute attitude toward this, and should collectively plan effective ways to address this. This is an unavoidable responsibility of all friendly countries towards China and the Far East, morally or legally, and it is also an obligation that all friendly countries must fulfill to uphold the future order of the world. As far as China’s position is concerned, if the Japanese army takes any military action in Vietnam or other Asian regions in the future, the Chinese government will not hesitate to use force to deal with it in order to safeguard its own security and to fulfill its consistent principles. Second, although war has broken out in Europe, our two major friendly countries, the Soviet Union and the United States, have not been drawn into the whirlpool of war and still have the power to increase their assistance to China. This is not only the duty of the Soviet Union and the United States, but also their responsibility and right. It is a well-known fact that Japan relies heavily on the United States for its military needs and commerce. The recent enactment of the embargo authorization law by the US Congress shows the demands of US public opinion. If the United States can quickly take decisive measures, and if the Soviet Union and the United States can both increase their aid to China, it will not be difficult to clarify and stabilize the overall situation in the Pacific Ocean soon. Finally, regarding the future of the overall world situation, we would also like to sincerely address a word to the people of friendly countries after reviewing recent events, that is, future efforts should be directed towards gathering countries that love international peace, building a strong international organization, and establishing an effective collective security system. The 455 million Chinese people are eager to work with the insightful people of friendly countries to lay the foundation for lasting world peace in order to improve the well-being of all mankind.

### Letter to Comrades: Elucidating the Party's Mission and Commemorating the Premier's Life

Chongqing. On the third anniversary of the War of Resistance, the Chairman will issue a letter to all party comrades, stating: "Today marks the third anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. I, Zhongzheng, look back and forward, filled with myriad emotions. As the Party bearing the responsibility of leadership, we must seize this opportunity to review the past and encourage the future. Therefore, in addition to issuing general letters, I would like to further clarify the mission of our Party and the awareness that each Party member should have, so that we can jointly abide by them and continue our efforts, to live up to the spirits of our Premier and the soldiers and civilians who sacrificed themselves for the country." What I, Zhongzheng, wish to share with all comrades is nothing other than taking the Premier's aspirations as our own. Throughout his life, the Premier exhausted his energy, running around and appealing, fighting regardless of life, death, success, or failure. His aim was to seek freedom and equality for China. In other words, it was to save the nation and the people from danger. Fifty years ago, the Premier had already foreseen that there would inevitably be a war of self-defense and national salvation today. However, with corrupt governance and a lack of national spirit, once foreign disasters deepened, the country would inevitably be destroyed and the race exterminated. Therefore, he put forth his utmost sincerity, advocated the National Revolution, and called on his compatriots to save themselves together. Furthermore, for the sake of the long-term stability of the country, he believed that all 450 million compatriots must be aware of themselves as masters of the country and jointly fulfill their national responsibilities. The Five-Power Constitution entrusts political power to the people, and he was also concerned that economic development would lead to class divisions, so he advocated equal land ownership and the regulation of capital as a preventive measure. The Premier was the pioneer of the nation, possessing the foresight of the times. With a spirit of great benevolence and courage, he advocated the principle of utmost impartiality and clarity. His basic understanding lay in the absolute reliance on the greatness of national culture for self-defense, as this is the instinct of our people. Revolution is based on the ideal of China. The decline of modern times is solely due to the obscuring of the people's wisdom. If there are people of lofty ideals and benevolence to lead the way, establish models, and inspire and encourage each other, then the national spirit will be vigorously aroused. What achievement cannot be made? What enemy cannot be destroyed? This is also the origin of the Premier's advocacy of the theory of knowing is easy but doing is difficult. To this day, it has become the foundation of the great cause of resistance and national reconstruction. Commemorating the greatness of the Premier can be summarized in two phrases: First, selfless; second, fearless. What does it mean to be selfless? Throughout his life, the Premier had only one thought that was pure and sincere: revolution and national salvation. Apart from this, there were no selfish plans or personal views. The Premier dedicated his entire life's energy, time, and life to the Chinese nation and the Chinese people, simply because he could not bear to see them perish and wanted to save them. His purpose was only to seek freedom and equality. From the perspective of human morality, this is utmost impartiality and not selfishness. Why fearless? The Premier absolutely relied on the national spirit, deeply knowing the profound foundation of our nation's inherent morality and intelligence. He firmly believed that once our people awaken and fight, they will definitely develop great strength, destroy all obstacles, and ensure permanent survival. If I revolt myself, who can stop me? If I do not destroy myself, who can destroy me? Because the Premier was fundamentally selfless, he was absolutely fearless. The conclusion drawn from these two phrases is the belief that the nation and the people will surely be saved, and the Three Principles of the People revolution will surely be successful. The only condition is struggle and sacrifice. Understanding this, we can know the mission of our Party. The Premier founded this Party, but he never considered it private. He was not only not private but wanted to overcome the selfishness of society and seek comrades who would abandon private interests and serve the public, to be advocates for the people. Therefore, the Premier taught Party members only one important thing: to struggle and sacrifice for the revolution and national salvation. Loving life and hating death are the most selfish emotions of mankind. The Premier sought comrades who would sacrifice themselves to save the country. Therefore, the basic spirit of our Party is to organize people who share the pure and sincere aspirations of revolution and national salvation, to sacrifice their lives, to serve the country loyally, to arouse the national spirit, and to fight together. This is what the Premier taught us and is also the guarantee on which China relies today to achieve final victory. Since I, Zhongzheng, have served the Premier and dedicated myself to the Party and the country, I have been moved by the Premier's lofty spirit and the greatness of his doctrine, and I have been inspired and resolute. Unfortunately, the Premier passed away prematurely. Fortunately, thanks to the guidance of the loyal elders in the Party, I have been able to work with my comrades to follow the legacy and strive for the cause of revolution and national salvation. Looking back over the past ten years, we have endured hardships and dangers. What we have adhered to in dealing with all revolutionary obstacles is precisely the Premier's great spirit of selflessness and fearlessness, and the absolute belief that national salvation must be achieved and the revolution must be successful. The past ten years have proven that our nation will inevitably respond, and the Premier's reliance on national power is not a concern. Japan, blinded by the strength of our national character and unaware of the greatness of the Premier's doctrine, took advantage of our revolutionary journey and launched a full-scale attack on this day three years ago, resulting in this great war. Now, I, Zhongzheng, reflect on what our Party has done for the country and the people. It is to uphold the legacy, determine national policies, lead Party comrades, inspire national compatriots, and unanimously abide by the legacy of revolution, national salvation, sacrifice, and struggle, and to die for the country. In the three years of arduous struggle, all our armed comrades have strived to be the first to give their lives. Their loyal and heroic deeds have moved the heavens and made the ghosts weep. What is even more inspiring is that since the War of Resistance, the people of the whole country have believed in the Premier's doctrine and admired the Premier's spirit, which has been fully developed. In these three years, the whole country has been under artillery fire and bombing, but our compatriots have been able to endure all kinds of hardships, support the government, and support the Party. This is the victory of our national spirit and the victory of our Premier's Three Principles of the People. It is regrettable that the Party had been in power for nearly ten years before the start of the War of Resistance. Although I, Zhongzheng, was aware of the urgency of foreign threats and was constantly concerned with building national defense, unfortunately, the unification had just been achieved, and there were still many changes, which consumed national strength and delayed the opportunity. Finally, relying on the protection of the nation's righteousness, the foundation of the country was able to remain intact. However, the facilities that I, Zhongzheng, idealized were far away on the day of deciding to fight three years ago. I am saying this now to encourage and reproach myself. I deeply hope that all Party comrades will encourage and reproach themselves, catch up quickly, because the obstacles in the past were ultimately due to the wrong understanding of some comrades, and the Party is responsible for guiding them. Guidance must rely on sincerity, and there is no better way to show sincerity than to set an example. Since the Party bears the heavy responsibility for the rise and fall of the country and the people, and all our compatriots are the objects of the Party's guidance, when obstacles arise, we must reflect on ourselves. All Party comrades should conduct a deep inspection and self-reflection to see if their sincerity is lacking, if their efforts are not enough, if they have truly practiced the oath to serve their duties with the spirit of pioneers, if they have had thoughts of fear and complacency, if they have purged the bad habits of hypocrisy and inertia, if they have completely eliminated public and private words and deeds, and if they are comparable to or have surpassed the non-Party members in the same profession and the same position, and can be their role models. Especially regarding the Party's orders, whether they are thoroughly obeyed and the tasks are completed, regarding the Party's resolutions, whether they are earnestly implemented and efforts are made to achieve them, and regarding the Party's laws and regulations, whether they are faithfully followed and their duties are not neglected. How much of the Party's doctrine has been implemented by us? How much of the Party's policies have been achieved by us? If the doctrine is not implemented, it is due to the disloyalty of the Party members. If the policies are ineffective, it is due to the cowardice of the Party members. Do you know this meaning clearly? Have you ever felt ashamed? All of these important points should be used to ensure that you can reflect on yourself without guilt, so that you can look up without shame. Party comrades should know that revolution and saving the country require Party comrades to spare no sacrifice and redouble their efforts to be pioneers. It is absolutely impossible to think that you have done your best simply because the soldiers of the national army are bravely resisting. I, Zhongzheng, am familiar with the overall situation and believe that the Party's responsibility to guide compatriots will be even greater in the future. Therefore, on the anniversary of the War of Resistance, I first urge all Party comrades to pay serious attention, and I hope that everyone will renew their vows before the Premier's portrait, and that they must take the Premier's aspirations as their own and die for the country, in order to awaken their compatriots to strengthen their efforts. All my comrades should deeply understand the Premier's great spirit of selflessness and fearlessness, and prove the Party's bright and upright mission at all times and in all places. The Party is absolutely one with the country and the people, representing the instinct of national self-defense and seeking the assurance of national independence and national freedom. This is completely different from political parties in other countries that represent the interests of professions, classes, and regions. Therefore, the Party's responsibility for political tutelage is only a necessary initial task for national salvation and national reconstruction. Political power must belong to the entire people and not to the Party. Struggle does not allow for delegation of responsibility, so we must take the lead in undertaking it. Therefore, before the start of the War of Resistance, we did our best to protect the foundation of the country, and what we tried to eliminate were only words and deeds that harmed China and divided China. Apart from this, there was no sectarianism, and there was no selfish governance. The main purpose was to strive for freedom and equality, so as to lay the foundation for the well-being of the nation for generations and to fulfill the revolutionary responsibility. We hope that the people of the country will participate in this effort. This spirit of the Party has achieved great results in the past three years. All my comrades must show their sincerity and strive to carry it out in the future. This is originally a policy that is absolutely supported by our compatriots. As long as we implement it with utmost sincerity, there is no reason why we cannot inspire the whole country. Moreover, I especially hope that my comrades will devote themselves to the revolution, not only touching people with words but also touching people with actions. Every Party member should understand the close relationship between the Party member and the Party, sharing honor and disgrace. Not only should we follow the example of the martyred comrades in dealing with life and death, but also in daily duties and work, and in public and private behavior, we should conduct self-examination and be role models for the people. Therefore, I hope that all my comrades will be able to endure the hardships that ordinary people cannot endure, do the work that ordinary people cannot do, be afraid of not being brave in their work, be afraid of not being humble in their abilities, be afraid of not being strict in their discipline, and be afraid of not being careful in their handling of affairs. At present, the work of resistance and national reconstruction, politics, is more important than military affairs, and construction is more important than combat. All my comrades must delve into various political and economic departments, diligently study academic subjects, intensify their work, strive for efficiency, and cherish every moment. As for providing relief to the dead and wounded, respecting the elderly and caring for the young, and all the work that serves the military and civilians during the war, my comrades should also go deep into the people and strive to put them into practice as role models. Only in this way can we be true followers of the Premier, and the nation will respect us for generations to come. If there are those who are members of the Party but cannot practice the morals that a Party member should have, or are corrupt and negligent and delay work, or neglect their duties, or even engage in corruption and self-interest and do not know how to cherish themselves, then Party discipline will not be lenient. I hope that all comrades serving in Party, government, and military organs at all levels will conduct strict inspections at all times to ensure thorough clarification. All my comrades must conduct self-examination and encourage each other, accept fair criticism, and strive to improve their cultivation and progress. Only by creating can we become healthy Party members, only by being progressive can we shoulder the heavy responsibilities of the revolution, and only by putting it into practice can we implement the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, we should not only eliminate the habits of following the old ways and being sluggish in a passive way, and correct our bad public and private lives, but also take a proactive approach, do things quickly and practically, and constantly progress and constantly strive. We should take on what ordinary people find difficult and go where the country needs us most, and create benefits for society and the people at all times and in all places, and then the doctrine can be promoted and policies can be implemented. It must be known that officials are the driving force of the country, and Party members are the vanguards of the people. The Premier's life was a model for our words and actions. Looking back since the Tongmenghui, my Party comrades have sacrificed their lives for the country, no less than hundreds of thousands of people. National justice is focused on the Party, enabling compatriots across the country to believe in the greatness of the Premier's doctrine, trust the Party, and support the Party. This is the great trust shown by the Party and the gift of the martyrs' sacrifices, which should be cherished by the comrades who die later. I firmly believe that all my comrades will abide by this righteousness, not avoid danger in times of crisis, take the lead in the face of difficulties, be diligent and brave, and fight without fail, so that the glory of the Three Principles of the People will surely shine throughout the country. My beloved comrades, let us all take this to heart and put it into practice! (6th dispatch)

Feng Tai Xiang and Others Will All Speak

Chongqing. The Chairman Chiang's letter to friendly nations, which will be broadcast tonight, will summarize the situation of the Sino-Japanese War over the past three years. The letter was drafted by He Yingqin. Starting tomorrow, the broadcast will continue for three days. Feng Zhuxiang, Zhang Qun, Wang Shijie, Song Meiling, Wang Chonghui, and others will all speak, elaborating on their thoughts on the July 7th anniversary of the War. Chairman Chiang's article will be published this afternoon. Minister He's broadcast will be broadcast in five dialects. The "Current Affairs News" commented this morning on the July 7th anniversary, stating that the number of Japanese soldiers killed or wounded by the end of last year in the Republic of China had reached 1,464,400. Adding the total for the six months of this year, the total number will reach 1.8 million. Japan used 26 divisions in the first year of the war, 31 divisions in the second year, and has increased to 41 divisions in the third year. Kong Xiangxi also published an article, emphasizing the stability of China's finances. The main reasons are (1) the solid foundation before the war, (2) the abundant harvest of agricultural products in the past three years, (3) the remarkable effectiveness of using urban funds, (4) a large amount of overseas remittances, and (5) the sympathy and assistance given by foreign countries. Minister of Finance Kong mentioned the issue of banknote issuance, saying that since the outbreak of the war, the demand for legal tender has gradually increased. Although the number of banknotes in circulation has increased, the total amount is still insufficient to meet the demand. Minister of Finance Kong then discussed taxation, saying that China's main tax revenues are customs duties, salt tax, and consolidated tax, all of which have been reduced. Therefore, the central government is using direct taxes as the backbone of China's national taxes. Income tax ranked sixth in national taxes before the war, but now it has jumped to third place. The national debt issued by China after the start of the war totaled 4.7 billion yuan. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

薛西爾 Sends Congratulations to Chairman Chiang

Chongqing. The Chairman of the International Anti-Aggression League, Xue Xier, and the Vice Chairman, Gao Te, recently sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, saying, "Your country's heroic resistance against aggression for three years is a model for anti-aggressors. Congratulations." (6th dispatch)

### Political Inspection Group Visits Zhejiang for Inspection, Chiang Tingfu Discusses the Inspection Process

Jinhua correspondence. The head of the Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi group of the Executive Yuan's Political Inspection Group, Chiang Tingfu, members Ni Weiqing, Li Rui, Wu Jingchao, secretary Zhao Hengrong, and others, accompanied by personnel sent by the Jiangxi Provincial Government, arrived in Jinhua on the evening of the 11th of last month. Huang Shaohong, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, sent a representative to welcome them. Chiang and others then visited Chairman Huang and discussed the grain problem in Zhejiang Province for two hours. It was decided that the provincial government would formulate a plan and then ask the central government for assistance, so the difficulties could be resolved. In the evening, they inspected the streets of the city. Xu Xuebin, the magistrate of Jinhua County, also reported on the local situation. Due to the urgency of time, Chiang and others left for Yongkang Fangdang on the morning of the 12th to inspect. They received inquiries from various committee members and department heads of the provincial government,

Zhejiang Provincial Political Situation

In the afternoon, they transferred to Lishui for inspection. On the 13th, they met with Chairman Chen in Fujian and then went to southern Jiangxi to inspect Guangdong and Guangxi. According to an interview with Chiang by the reporter, they left Sichuan on the 15th. The scope of the inspection was originally Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi. Zhejiang and Fujian were not originally included in the regulations. After arriving in Jiangxi, because Zhejiang and Fujian were not far away, they took this opportunity to temporarily decide to go there and meet with the provincial authorities to discuss issues such as mutual assistance in grain supervision between neighboring provinces. The purpose of this inspection was to adjust local politics and investigate the economic situation of the countryside. Although the situations in each province were different, they were working hard to solve various difficulties. Everything in Hunan and Jiangxi

Has Made Considerable Progress

Especially the improvement of the rural economy and the development of handicrafts in various places have shown a rapid surge. The industries that were originally suppressed by imported goods are also gradually recovering, and the situation is better than before the War of Resistance. In terms of conscription, Anren in Hunan and Guixi in Jiangxi have achieved the best results. For example, the compilation of the roster of strong men is clear, and the preferential treatment of the families of soldiers on expeditions is well-organized, which is commendable. As for the implementation of the new county system, the methods of each province are different. For example, Hunan Province is implementing it in stages. Twenty-three counties will be the first to implement it starting on July 1st. After that, more than twenty counties will be implemented every six months, with the goal of completing it in a few years. Jiangxi Province plans to unify the entire province because the township and village baojia organizations have a better foundation.

### French Aircraft Bomb Gibraltar, Retaliatory Action Against Britain, Germany Cancels Naval Provisions of the Agreement, Allowing the French Fleet to Retain Weapons

Rome. According to the Italian Agence d'Allemagne reports, a number of French aircraft dropped bombs on the British military fortress in Gibraltar at 6 a.m. yesterday. The British anti-aircraft artillery fired back. Details are still unknown. It is generally believed that France's move was to retaliate against Britain's attack on its fleet in Oran. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

Gibraltar, British Territory. The port was bombed by enemy aircraft for the first time this morning before noon. A total of eight bombs were dropped, but they were aimless and all fell into the sea. Therefore, there was no damage to the ground, and there were no civilian casualties. Local anti-aircraft artillery also fired back, and the enemy aircraft fled in panic, apparently flying towards French Algeria in North Africa. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

Wiesbaden. The German Armistice Commission notified the French representatives today that, in view of the Oran incident, the German Supreme Military Command is prepared to temporarily suspend the requirement that French warships be disarmed. It is reported that the German Commission sought the consent of the Italian Armistice Commission before taking this decision. (Reuter dispatch, 6th)

Berlin. Yesterday's news, Hitler has formally allowed France to retain its army and navy for retaliatory purposes. According to reports from Germany's capital, the Pétain government has severed diplomatic relations with Britain. At the same time, the Armistice Commission has informed France that it will temporarily cancel the provisions for disbanding the French Navy. Therefore, the French fleet, originally bound by the armistice provisions, can now freely leave the harbor and strike. (International News Service dispatch, 6th)

### Battle of Oran Not Over, French Casualties Exceed 1,000

Algiers. The Anglo-French naval battle is still ongoing. No fewer than a thousand French fleet officers and sailors have been killed, injured, or are missing. According to the official French report from Oran, three French battleships and one light cruiser have been severely damaged and run aground. The three ships lost are the "Dunkerque," "Bretagne," and "Provence," and the light cruiser is the "Mogador." Another small ship had its stern blown off and ran aground. In the waters off Cape Matifou in the Algiers area, a French patrol boat was destroyed, apparently by artillery fire or a mine. However, all the personnel on board were rescued. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

London. The German official news agency published a Geneva dispatch, saying that according to Vichy sources, the French destroyer "Frontière" has been sunk by a British destroyer in the Mediterranean Sea. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

London. London points out that the claim that the French destroyer "Frontière" was sunk by a British ship in the Mediterranean Sea is baseless. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Vichy. According to semi-official French sources, the French escort ship "Général de Lyautey" was torpedoed and sunk off Algeria without warning. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Vichy. The Commander-in-Chief of the French Navy, Admiral Darlan, issued a letter to his officers and soldiers this morning, stating, "I sincerely pay tribute to the French soldiers who died in the naval battle of Oran. Their sacrifices were not in vain. The German-French armistice agreement stipulates that the French fleet must not be used for combat tomorrow. We have accepted the armistice agreement. In the current tragic situation, we must consider the higher interests of France. You have understood this point, and I express my gratitude to you. We must fulfill our promises in order to preserve France." (Reuter dispatch, 6th)

### Several French Warships Arrive in British Territorial Waters, Fleet Stationed in Egypt Willing to Join Britain in Combat

London. Naval sources here have confirmed that several French warships have indeed sailed into Scottish territorial waters. Several other warships, originally being built in French shipyards, have also been towed across the English Channel. All the workers are on the warships, and whether they will continue to work or be repatriated will be their own choice. Regarding this matter, semi-official sources have commented that British officers and soldiers are all heartbroken about the conflict between British and French warships in Oran, North Africa, firstly, sympathizing with the unfortunate encounters of the French officers and soldiers, and secondly, admiring their spirit of obeying government orders. In addition, the French fleet in Alexandria, Egypt, has expressed its willingness to fight alongside Britain, which is quite commendable. (Havas, 6th)

Alexandria. There is still no news about the status of the French fleet stationed here. However, on Thursday, French sailors remained on board, and fewer British sailors landed. Last night, traces of British and French sailors were searched everywhere in the town. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

### French Foreign Minister's Speech, Viciously Accusing Britain of Betraying its Friends

Geneva. French Radio announced yesterday afternoon that Foreign Minister Baudouin delivered a speech to foreign reporters, accusing Britain of betraying France in political and military terms. His words were roughly as follows: "Britain, not France, was the first to declare war on Germany. During the war in the Netherlands and Belgium, and even the war in the Flanders region, Britain was only concerned with defending itself. In fact, Britain never sent its main forces to fight in France. The achievements of the British army in the battle of the Flanders region were merely to carry out a retreat, and its losses were only one-fifth of its expeditionary force. In the battle of the Flanders region, France lost 50% of its troops. The British army was able to escape from the Flanders region entirely thanks to the sacrifices of the French army. The French Navy also shed blood and sacrificed itself everywhere for Britain, covering its navy. However, the reward for France's spirit of selflessness was that the French ships docked in Oran were attacked by the British Navy. At that time, the French military was collapsing and had to sign an armistice with Germany. Britain had no soldiers left in France. Later, General Pétain and I repeatedly explained to Britain that Germany had no intention of asking the French to surrender their warships to join the German fleet to attack Britain. After the armistice agreement was signed, the French government reaffirmed its will on the naval issue to Britain. But in fact, when the French warships were not taking any action, Britain launched an attack without hesitation. The French people were outraged when they heard this." (Reuter dispatch, 6th)

Geneva. Diplomatic sources here believe that Foreign Minister Baudouin's remarks to journalists confirm France's desire to change its diplomatic policy, to distance itself from Britain and approach the Axis powers. According to Baudouin, Churchill promised on June 13 that if France was forced to negotiate peace alone, Britain would respect the independence of the French Navy. In other words, Churchill went back on his word. Baudouin also said that France had attempted to restore diplomatic relations between Britain and France, but had been unable to do so, indicating that Churchill had been planning to attack the French fleet ten days ago. France believes that since Britain does not hesitate to destroy the friendship between the two countries, France intends to participate in the establishment of a European order, leaving Britain with no foothold.

### Italian Foreign Minister Visits Berlin for Important Discussions, Covering Military and Political Issues; New Developments Expected in Europe

Rome: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Berlin was kept strictly secret beforehand. There were no farewell ceremonies when he departed from Rome today. The "Stefani News Agency" only released an official announcement several hours after Ciano's departure. It is reported that the German Ambassador to Italy, Dr. Mackensen, and Ambassador Muti, a key official of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accompanied Ciano. (Haitong Telegraph, 6th)

Berlin: Hitler returned to Berlin at 3 PM today, arriving one day earlier than Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. It is rumored that Hitler will hold important discussions with Ciano. Officials deny that these talks involve peace negotiations with Britain, but well-informed sources say, "If this peace agreement equates to a complete German victory, we might consider granting Britain's requests." It is said that Ciano will not return to Rome immediately after his talks with Hitler but will travel elsewhere. (United Press, 6th)

Berlin: The political circles here are not surprised by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Berlin. It has become customary for key figures from the Axis powers to hold consultations when important decisions are made. In August 1938, before the outbreak of war, Ciano had lengthy talks with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Salzburg and then met with Hitler. After the end of the Polish campaign, on October 6th, when Fuehrer Hitler delivered his speech in the Reichstag proposing peace to Britain and France, Ciano was also in Berlin. This spring, before the German army began the Norwegian campaign, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop visited Rome. A few days later, Fuehrer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met at the Brenner Pass. Most recently, on June 18th, the two leaders and the two foreign ministers met in Munich to discuss the stance of Germany and Italy in the armistice negotiations with France. Although the itinerary of this visit by the Italian Foreign Minister has not yet been announced, there is no doubt that he will discuss all current political issues with German figures. Political circles believe that the discussions between Germany and Italy will cover approximately the following three areas: (1) Relations between Britain and France, (2) The Mediterranean issue, (3) The issue of Southeastern Europe. (Haitong Telegraph, 6th)

### Hitler Returns to the Capital; Grand Public Welcome

Berlin: This afternoon, after Hitler returned to Berlin from his field headquarters, crowds gathered outside the Chancellery to pay their respects. Hitler, accompanied by General Goering, Ribbentrop, General Brauchitsch, and Admiral Raeder, appeared on the platform, and the people sang "We Are Marching Against England." When Hitler arrived in Berlin at 2 PM, all streets from the Halensee train station to the Chancellery were guarded. The German radio station had previously warned residents not to throw flowers at the Fuehrer's car as it passed through the streets of Berlin. All flowers should be placed on the road before the vehicles passed. White wooden posts with flower crowns tied with gold ribbons were erected on all streets, and the houses were decorated with birch branches. (Reuters, 6th)

### French Government to Convene National Assembly to Discuss Constitutional Amendments and Expand Government Power

Geneva: According to reports from Vichy, the French government will formulate a new constitution by the end of next week, stipulating a reduction in the power of parliament and an increase in the power of the government leader. The French Senate and Chamber of Deputies will meet at 10 AM on July 9th to organize a National Assembly to discuss constitutional amendments. At that time, France will have a brand-new political posture, open to the eyes of the world. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

### People Aiding Britain in War to Be Charged with Endangering the State

Vichy: The French government yesterday promulgated a decree stating that any French citizens who continue to fight against Germany and Italy on the side of the Allies after the signing of the armistice agreements between Germany and France, and Italy and France, will be charged by the French authorities with endangering the state and sentenced to death or life imprisonment. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

### Reynaud's Injuries Not Serious

Vichy: There were previous reports that former French Premier Reynaud had been involved in a car accident. According to semi-official sources, Reynaud's injuries are no longer a cause for concern. (Reuters, 6th)

### Southern Coast of England Declared a Defense Zone; Strict Measures Against Fifth Column Activities; All Foreign Nationals in Britain Must Register

London: The British government today took further precautionary measures to deal with any actions that the enemy may take. The Home Office has designated the southern coast, from Hastings in Sussex to a certain location in Dorset, as a coastal defense zone, extending twenty miles inland. It is understood that government authorities will soon issue orders restricting traffic within this coastal defense zone. All residents of the area, unless they have sufficient reason, are prohibited from driving vehicles arbitrarily, so as not to hinder road traffic within the zone. In this regard, the Ministry of Transport will work closely with the Home Office and has authorized local air defense authorities to prohibit "unnecessary" vehicles from traveling on important highways essential for troop movements, and to designate highways that can continue to be used normally, so that residents are fully aware of them. In addition, the Home Office has also issued orders stipulating that all foreign nationals, except for diplomatic and consular personnel, may not possess British maps with a scale larger than 1:750,000. Various travel guides that detail highway and railway traffic conditions within Britain are also prohibited from being kept and must be handed over to the authorities before the 9th of this month. Even British subjects must obtain permission from the authorities before they can keep such books and maps. Libraries everywhere have also been ordered to carefully conceal all detailed maps. (Havas, 5th)

London: Police authorities in Manchester and Salford today arrested more than one hundred enemy aliens. At the same time, the Home Office issued a notice to a portion of naturalized Austrians, Germans, and Italians who are 16 years of age or older and who obtained British citizenship after December 1, 1932, requiring them to register at the local police station on the 7th and 8th of this month and to present their British citizenship certificates, identification documents, and photographs. (Havas, 5th)

### German Air Raids on Southeastern England; "Whistling" Bombs Dropped; British Aircraft Bomb German Transportation Lines

London: German aircraft attacked a certain town in southeastern England last night, dropping eight "whistling" bombs, but material losses were minimal, except for the destruction of one bungalow. Six bombs fell in open areas. Another town in the southeast was attacked for the first time, with German aircraft dropping five bombs, injuring one soldier. Yesterday, German aircraft appeared alone over the southwest and southeast of England and a certain town in Wales. Late last night, enemy aircraft flew over the northeast coast of England, dropping five or six bombs. It is not yet known whether there were any casualties. Anti-aircraft guns fired back. (Reuters, 6th)

London: German aircraft again launched a major attack on England yesterday. British anti-aircraft units fiercely attacked the German aircraft formations on the southeast coast of England, greatly hindering them. However, at the same time, German aircraft dropped six bombs in northeastern England. According to the Ministry of Aviation, the British Air Force has also been unusually active recently, inflicting heavy damage on German shipping off the coast of Norway. A large German transport ship has been destroyed. Observers say that the British Air Force is now engaged in attacking the main transportation lines of the German army in order to thwart Hitler's plan to attack England using "blitzkrieg tactics." (International News Service, 6th)

### French Government Leaning Towards Fascism; Severing Diplomatic Relations with Britain; London Not Surprised

London: The newspapers here did not express much surprise at the severance of diplomatic relations between Britain and France. The diplomatic correspondent of "The Times" claimed that it was noteworthy that the initial news of the severance of relations between Britain and France did not come from the French side, but was transmitted by the German official news agency yesterday morning. At that time, there was no news from Vichy. The declaration of severance of relations was not issued by Vichy until the evening. The newspaper also mentioned the declaration of German and Italian resentment of Britain's actions against the French fleet. Judging from the remarks made by Germany and Italy, it can be proved that the actions on Wednesday indirectly struck a blow to the enemy's military value. Within the scope of the actions, these two dictators could do nothing but instruct their puppet, Petain, to sever diplomatic ties with Britain. This move was expected. Its main practical effect is to draw a clear line between those in Free France who continue to fight and those who are willing to submit to the aggressors of their country. (Reuters, 6th)

### German Propaganda of Secret Anglo-Jewish Pact; Content Includes Five Points

Oslo: According to local newspapers, British Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Halifax signed a secret covenant with the Executive Committee of the Zionist Organization on June 22.

The Jewish Free State is an autonomous territory under the British Empire. (2) The Jewish Free State will acquire the territory of Palestine (except for the south) and part of Syria, as well as the highlands of Abyssinia.

(3) Construction of the Jewish Free State will begin, and it will be temporarily protected by the British army for the next five years. (4) An Anglo-Jewish company will be organized and guaranteed by the Bank of England. (5) This agreement will take effect after the end of the current war and will be part of the future peace treaty. (Haitong Telegraph, 6th)

### American Monroe Doctrine; Germany Formally Refuses to Recognize; Note to the United States Says No Intention to Claim Territory; US Believes German Explanation Is Untenable

Washington: Germany yesterday delivered a formal note to the United States, rejecting the recent warning issued by the United States to European powers not to interfere in the Western Hemisphere. The State Department announced that it had received the German note at the same time that rumors were spreading that war might break out in the Western Hemisphere, as it was learned that a British cruiser fleet had blockaded the French Martinique Island in the Windward Islands. In rejecting the American warning regarding the Western Hemisphere, the German note stated that Germany had never shown any intention to interfere in the Western Hemisphere or to claim territory in the Western Hemisphere. Therefore, the United States has no reason to issue a warning. The note also warned that if the American republics hope to gain respect for the principle of non-interference in American affairs by European countries, as explained by the Monroe Doctrine, then the American republics should also not interfere in European affairs. The German note was released by the State Department, along with a commentary by Secretary of State Hull. Hull emphasized that the governments and peoples of Latin America, and undoubtedly most of the rest of the world, fully understand the basic issues involved.

Hull reiterated that the purpose of the Monroe Doctrine is to avoid any aggression against the Western Hemisphere by any non-American power, and at the same time to curb the expansion of any non-American governmental system and countries in the Western Hemisphere. The German note is a formal response to the United States, which shortly before France signed a peace treaty with Germany and Italy, separately sent documents to Britain, France, Germany and Italy. The purpose of the American note was to warn European powers against any attempt to transfer territory in the Western Hemisphere from one European country to another. (United Press, 6th)

### Hull Reaffirms US Position; Aims to Maintain Independence and Integrity

Washington: Judging from the general meaning of the public document released by US Secretary of State Hull, Germany refuses to recognize the US interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine, deeming it untenable. Hull said that the US government feels that it would not be beneficial to handle this matter with the German government at this time. The United States had previously stated that the United States would not allow land in the Western Hemisphere to be transferred from one European country to another European country. This position of the United States has not changed to this day. Today Hull has reaffirmed this position in his official remarks. The German letter is a reply to the Washington letter of June 18, which stated that the non-interference in American affairs required by the Monroe Doctrine can only have legal effect in principle on the condition that the American countries do not interfere in European affairs. After reading the main points of the German reply, Hull said that the Monroe Doctrine has nothing to do with the fact that certain countries in Europe own land in the Americas, while other European countries do not. The Monroe Doctrine is purely a self-defense policy aimed at maintaining the independence and integrity of the American countries. Hull concluded by saying that although the United States is pursuing a policy of non-participation and non-interference in purely political events in Europe, the United States will continue its cooperation with other countries when its policies make it possible to unite with other countries. Hull's remarks were clearly approved by President Roosevelt. (Reuters, 6th)

Washington: The State Department announced yesterday that the United States has warned Germany that if any German officials stationed in the United States openly criticize US policies, Germany must dismiss and recall them. It is reported that Berlin sent a note to the United States stating that Germany would only approve of the US Monroe Doctrine if the Americas did not interfere in European affairs, that is, if Europeans did not interfere in American affairs. Furthermore, the German Consul General in New Orleans, Bickelch, stated in an interview with reporters on June 14 that Germany would not forget that the United States was constantly providing military assistance to Britain. For these two reasons, the aforementioned warning was issued after Hull's rebuttal to Germany. (International News Service, 6th)

### French Martinique Island; London States No Blockade

Washington: Last night, there was fear here that the European war would extend to the Western Hemisphere, because Germany had clearly rejected the Monroe Doctrine. At the same time, it was reported that the British cruiser fleet had completed a blockade line around the French Martinique Island in the Caribbean Sea. French people here are deeply concerned that the French troops in Martinique and the British Navy may start a war at any time. The Martinique authorities support the French Petain government, which signed a peace treaty with Germany and Italy. It is reported that in the days before France surrendered, a large number of American aircraft were shipped to France, and then transferred by French ships to Martinique Island. It is believed here that the British Navy has decided not to let these aircraft fall into the hands of the Germans. For this reason, French people here predict that the British cruiser fleet blockading Martinique Island will enter the island's harbor in the near future. Unconfirmed news said that the French aircraft carrier "Béarn" is currently in Martinique Island, carrying 100 American aircraft, in addition to the ship's original 40 aircraft. It is heard that the "Béarn" sailed from a certain Canadian port on June 17, carrying 100 American aircraft. When Germany and France signed a peace treaty, it evaded and went to Martinique Island. The garrisons in the French overseas territories have all been ordered by the Petain government to attack any British warships entering within 12.5 miles of French territorial waters. It is generally believed that if the British cruiser fleet attempts to search the French ships on Martinique Island, the French garrison on the shore will definitely open fire. French people here are speculating whether Britain will invade Martinique Island and disintegrate the government there that supports the Petain regime. If Martinique Island cannot be placed under blockade, then the island will be an excellent base for German submarines, enough to attack shipping routes between Britain and the United States. (United Press, 6th)

London: London firmly stated that the Royal Navy has not blockaded Martinique. According to news from French people in Washington, the purpose of this blockade is to prevent a batch of military aircraft from falling into the hands of the Germans. Responsible parties in London said that the Royal Navy is capable of dealing with this situation without having to implement a blockade. (Reuters, 6th)

### Japan Actively Engaged in Improving; Business with Latin America; Pacific International Institute Survey Report; Established As Many As Seven Commercial Agreements in Half a Year

San Francisco: According to a survey report by the Pacific International Relations Institute, Japan has recently been actively working to improve its commercial relations with Latin America. Since this year, Japan has concluded as many as seven commercial treaties or agreements with various Latin American republics. Japan's commercial "blitzkrieg tactics" in Latin America can be seen in the speed with which treaties are signed. After one treaty is concluded, it is immediately followed by the signing of another. Among this large batch of new treaties, the first to be established was the treaty with Chile. The treaty was signed in January of this year. The agreement stipulates that Japan's annual purchase of nitrates from Chile will increase from approximately 30,000 tons to 70,000 tons. In addition, it can also purchase copper, beans, various vegetables, various dried fruits, and cooking salt. The goods that Japan sells to Chile are ironware, glass, and toys. The second is the commercial agreement with Uruguay, which was signed on February 21 of this year. The agreement stipulates that Uruguay will sell wool, leather, and scrap iron to Japan, and Japan will sell cotton textiles and rayon to Uruguay. The third is the commercial agreement with Argentina, which was concluded on March 15, immediately after the Japanese-Uruguayan commercial agreement. The agreement stipulates that trade between the two countries will increase to 60 million Japanese yen per year, three times more than in 1939. Japan can purchase wool, frozen meat, canned meat, casein, and other products from Argentina. Japan will enjoy favorable exchange rates when exporting chemicals, cotton textiles, steel products, and other manufactured goods to Argentina. Only two days after the signing of the Japanese-Argentine commercial agreement, on March 17, Japan began negotiations with Mexico. The Mexican commercial commissioner went to Tokyo to discuss barter trade agreements and Japanese investment in Mexico. Although a complete commercial treaty has not yet been established, in fact a certain Japanese company has signed a purchase contract worth 3 million Mexican pesos with the Mexican government to purchase Mexican kerosene and gasoline. It is also heard that in order to subsidize Japanese freight costs and Panama Canal tolls, Mexico estimates the price of these items to be extremely low. The commercial agreements and negotiations between Japan and Colombia and Venezuela also focus on oil, because oil is the bulk of these countries' exports and is urgently needed by Japan. Regarding Japan's negotiations with other Central and South American countries, the survey report said, "In the current Japanese commercial offensive, several phenomena have hindered Japan's economic life. These phenomena are interrelated, yet each has its own special characteristics and did not exist before the Sino-Japanese War, such as the European war and Washington's abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty. In terms of these two, Japan is in a dangerous situation, because Japan is very dependent on Britain and the United States, and these two countries are special suppliers of raw materials for Japan, and they are also markets for the sale of goods. Although Latin America has never occupied an important position in Japan's trade, many raw materials, whether in wartime or peacetime, are needed by Japan. These raw materials are all produced in the Great River (Latin American rivers, referring to the Latin American region, for this reason). The expansion of trade between Latin America and Japan is easy, especially after the outbreak of the European war disrupted the normal trade between South America and Europe, the realization of this situation is necessary. However, from a close examination of Japan's side, putting aside its internal difficulties, its desire to gain anything in the near future may not be as desired. Furthermore, a force has existed since 1930 that is sufficient to prevent Japan's trade in Latin America from surpassing that of Europe and the United States. In other words, Japan's inability to develop in South America is due to two obstacles. First, Japan's new industries in Latin America do not have huge investments. Second, it is not easy for Japan to spur Latin America to fully adapt to Japan's needs. (United Press, 6th)

### US President's Speech Broadly Discusses Peace Goals; Disarmament, Freedom of Information and Speech; Removal of International Cultural and Commercial Barriers

Hyde Park: When President Roosevelt was hosting reporters here, he said that there are five key points that must be realized before lasting peace can be achieved, namely (1) Elimination of fear, which requires disarmament, (2) Freedom of information, the whole country must be able to obtain information on how things are progressing at home and around the world. Therefore, this freedom is very important. If the various tools for disseminating information are not free, there can be no stable world. (3) Freedom of religion, this freedom is well maintained in democratic countries, but not so in other political systems. (4) Freedom of speech, everyone should be free to express their opinions, as long as they do not advocate overthrowing the government. (5) Elimination of desire, this point must be achieved by removing international cultural and commercial barriers. President Roosevelt said that the outline of the above five goals has raised the question of whether the United States will seek these five points, or give them up, or encourage countries that have already given up these five points because no one opposes them, so as to establish more effective governments. He admitted that the totalitarian governments maintained by Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union are more effective than democratic countries. The US political system has places where things are done too slowly due to the system of checks and balances among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Many Americans are willing to adopt their political systems because totalitarian countries are more efficient. This is what he is depressed about. Although there are many such people, they are not the majority in the country. (Reuters, 6th)

### Soviet Union Opposes Blockade of Yunnan-Burma Transportation; British Reply to Japan to be Delivered

London: Well-informed sources have stated that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Stafford Cripps, has informed Britain that the Soviet Union will strongly oppose the blockade of the Yunnan-Burma Road. The British Foreign Office will cite the Soviet Union's opinion to reject Japan's demands. It is also believed that the British reply will be delivered to Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Mr. Craigie, within the next two days. The reply will likely contain simple phrasing, stating that the issue involves other countries, and therefore the British government cannot comply with the request to block the Burma Road. Reliable sources also indicate that the British reply will point out that non-military goods are also transported via the Yunnan-Burma Road. It is believed that Japan's request to blockade Hong Kong's transportation will be ignored, as this route is practically non-existent. Reliable sources also stated that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov told British Ambassador Cripps that the Soviet Union strongly opposes any action that weakens China's resistance. Molotov also said that in addition to transporting goods to China via Xinjiang, Soviet goods are also often transported to China via Burma. Therefore, the Soviet Union must have a say in the fate of the Burma Road. Although Britain is eager to seek a peaceful resolution with Japan, it is unwilling to sacrifice China's interests, especially at this critical time in British-Soviet relations. Britain does not want to undermine the improvement of British-Soviet relations. When Britain discussed Japan's demands with Australia and New Zealand, it also consulted with the United States and exchanged views with the Soviet Union. Well-informed sources said that Britain may ask Japan to discuss the matter directly with the United States, as the issue also involves American interests. (United Press, 6th)

### Intense Battle in the United Cup Basketball Tournament; Paramount Defeats Shanghai Youth; Shanghai Youth Lacks Stamina in 66-43 Match; Exciting Battle Between Liangxi and Qifan Today

In the first round of the United Cup Charity Basketball Tournament, the two giants of Group A, Paramount and Shanghai Youth, had their first encounter. Both sides had strong players, well-organized lineups, and evenly matched strengths. After the dissolution of Hualian, Li Zhenzhong and Bao Songyuan joined Paramount, while Shen 　Gong, Ren Xiangcheng, and Chen Xuechong played for Shanghai Youth. Former teammates became opponents, so the battle was inextricably linked. The first half was especially tense, with the difference always within a few points. Unfortunately, Shanghai Youth lacked stamina, resulting in a sharp decline. As a result, the score was 66-43, with the first half being 29-22. Because the competition was too intense, the actions were inevitably excessive, which was also a drawback. In terms of performance, Paramount was definitely better. Yesterday, the Paramount court was completely surrounded, and it was very lively. The band of the Orphans' Training Institute also performed to add to the excitement. In the opening game, Shangxing played against Xihua. Shangxing took the lead, taking a 14-6 lead in the first half. After the exchange, Xihua counterattacked, catching up and tying at 21 each. Shangxing finally relied on Zhuang Kunpeng's remote shot to hit the target, and the time ended, so they won with 23-21. However, there was a question of whether one of the balls was hit, and it is said that the Xihua team may file a protest.

Paramount Comes From Behind

The main battle began, Zhang Shaoqing of Paramount scored four points with two free throws. Sun, Shen, Li, and Ren of Shanghai Youth built successively, surpassing the other side with 11-5 momentum, and the Paramount men responded calmly. Relying on Li Zhenzhong's wonderful shot, they forced equalizing at 15 each. Yu Gong and Xue Chong of Shanghai Youth both shot from left and right, still maintaining the leading position. Zhenzhong and Xianglong of Paramount then hit the net, first surpassing the other team with 20-19. Yu Gong then shot the other team on his way back. With a aerial penalty by Da Mao, Shanghai Youth once again was in a leading position. However, when Shanghai Youth was on top of its glory, its players slacked, and Zhang Shaoqing of Paramount went off to rest and then Bao Songyuan came on, and the team's momentum changed significantly. They scored more than nine points in a row. On the other hand, Shanghai Youth did not gain anything at all in the more than six minutes of this. From then on, Paramount's victory was basically confirmed. As the first half came to an end, Paramount got 29 points, and Shanghai Youth got 22 points.

Shanghai Youth Can't Save the Situation

After the exchange, Paramount still played with the original lineup, while Shanghai Youth brought Li Zude instead of Yu Dehai. Li Zhenzhong first showed off his shooting skill, and Chen Xuechong immediately responded. Sun Da Mao shot twice at the side, and Shanghai Youth was about to revive. Fortunately, Bao Songyuan and Chen Xianglong both took pearls on the team to try to curb Shanghai Youth from having the opportunity to raise its head again. Zhang Shaoqing soon came back on the front line, and Paramount's offensive became sharper. From 36-32, Paramount went on to have Zhenzhong, Songyuan, and Shaoqing scored, especially Bao Songyuan, who became even more active, suddenly increased by ten points, and the score became 46-36, with a difference of ten points. From then on, Shanghai Youth's morale seemed to have been greatly discouraged, and the team was unable to revive. Paramount took over the victory, changed to Zhou Zhi to play. Nian Hua and Songyuan were brilliant, and in the last ten minutes, the people saw nothing but Paramount's dominating the game. With the long whistle, Paramount won with 66-43.

### Student Summer Work—Written for the Newspaper's Summer Essay Contest for Middle and High School Students

—Shen Tilan

Mr. Shen is a famous educator and specially wrote this article for the newspaper's summer essay contest for middle and high school students. Mr. Shen believes that middle and high school students, whether or not they participate in summer school or summer camps, should focus on collective research, collective service, collective sports, and other operations suitable for the times. This newspaper believes that the results and experiences of research, service, and sports are excellent materials for writing. We hope that all students will follow Mr. Shen's suggestions, do it practically, and complete the essay contest entries. The summer vacation is coming to an end, and the articles submitted should be wonderful. —The Editor

Summer vacation is the longest holiday of the year for schools. When students arrive at the summer vacation, the question arises of how to spend the holiday.

In recent years, students in middle and above schools have felt interested in using summer work and have made various attempts. This is a good phenomenon, but in general, students only pay attention to spending the holiday and have not grasped the center of summer work, which is still a regret.

Summer work, of course, should be devoted to the cultivation of personal physical and mental health and the preparation for further education and employment, but it is not enough to start from a personal standpoint alone. In the great era of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, young people should do something that contributes to the country and the nation. This is the most central topic of student summer work.

The most common summer work for students is to join summer students. Their purpose is often to make up for credits or tutor failed subjects. This can be considered beneficial work, but most of these students usually do not work hard enough and have slightly worse grades, and they want to find a way to remedy it in the summer. The motivation is not very pure. Moreover, the summer school is short, and students are mostly perfunctory, only seeking to complete the term and be able to make up for credits. They do not care about other ideological research and life training. Such a summer school has almost become a prison for lively and promising young people. It is definitely not a suitable summer work for students. As for an ideal summer school, in addition to setting up important subjects, teachers and students should teach and learn earnestly, and there should be suitable books and experimental equipment, especially various extracurricular operations suitable for the times. This is the first point of student summer work.

The student summer camps or summer camps promoted by the YMCA over the years have attracted many ambitious and active young people, especially Christian believers. There is spiritual practice, lectures, discussions, labor, sports, and friendship. It is a collective training for the average development of life in many aspects. In terms of educational significance, it is a very progressive facility. Unfortunately, it only limits the recruitment of some students and cannot popularize the public. In recent years, other agencies and groups have also begun to hold summer camps or summer camps, but they lack the excellent traditions and achievements of Christianity and are not very good. We hope that all students who have the opportunity to participate in this year's YMCA summer camp or summer camp should not easily let go of the summer camp, and pay more attention to various operations suitable for the times. If possible, its scope should be expanded to give more students the opportunity to participate.

For students who do not participate in summer school and summer camps, or who have joined but still have some free time, it is possible to combine several young comrades to do various collective work. These groups only need a simple center of interest, whether it is research, sports, or service. The important thing is that the work is carried out regularly and without interruption. As for the location, it is best to find a way to borrow school buildings. Otherwise, it can only be held in students' homes in turn. However, although these groups do different jobs, everyone should have a common goal of recognizing the times and sharpening their ambitions. Otherwise, there will be a danger of falling behind and corruption. As for service-oriented work, the most convenient are popular schools and voluntary schools. Students often like to travel during the summer vacation. Since the War of Resistance, many young people have thought of going to the interior, but the travel expenses are quite expensive now. Except for those who have decided to go to the interior for further education and employment, they can go and do not have to come back. The rest can only go to the eastern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu areas nearby, which is relatively economical. But it is just a superficial look and does not have much meaning. It is best to have the introduction of relatives and friends to get some temporary work or training. We have absorbed the air of freedom in the interior and then returned to the isolated island, which can make our vision farther, our will firmer, and our courage more majestic. We are equipped to bear the arduous tasks in this great era.

### Three Years Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident: Silent Commemoration by All Circles in Shanghai; Cessation of Entertainment to Mourn the Martyred Soldiers and Civilians; Strict Precautions Taken by Concession Authorities

Today marks the third anniversary of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. As designated by the Central Government as the War of Resistance and Nation-Building Commemoration Day, all circles in Shanghai will not hold any commemorative ceremonies. However, they will all silently commemorate the day with a spirit of perseverance and voluntarily cease entertainment and banquets to mourn the martyred soldiers and civilians. As the severe winter is approaching rapidly, all circles believe that the troops and refugees need to be provided with winter clothing and bedding in advance. Therefore, they have initiated the "Early Winter Clothing Donation Campaign" to prepare. The authorities of the two concessions are implementing special strict precautions throughout the day today. The details are as follows:

Full Mobilization of Defense Troops, Corps, and Police

The police authorities of the two concessions, all police officers from various police stations, and reserve special constables have been fully mobilized to participate in today's special precautions. The curfew before "July 7th" has been intensified since the evening of the day before yesterday, and last night it was specially extended from 11:30 PM to 5:00 AM. The British and American troops stationed in the Public Concession have also been ordered to begin deployment this morning. It is reported that the French troops stationed in the French Concession have also been deployed. In addition to deploying troops to guard key locations in their respective defense areas, patrol teams have been formed to conduct patrols. These stationed troops, together with the Shanghai Volunteer Corps of the Public Concession and the French Volunteer Corps of the French Concession, total more than 10,000 armed personnel deployed for precautions. With such a strong force, public security is definitely assured.

Strict Searches at Transportation Hubs

The authorities of the two concessions have also internally decided to start using barbed wire to block roads after 11:00 PM last night. Roads such as Zhubao San Road, Sanyangjing Bridge, Shandong Road, Hubei Road, Yunnan Road, Chongqing Road, and Chengdu Road at the junction of the two concessions on Avenue Edward VII have all begun to be blocked or are preparing to be blocked. However, major transportation hubs such as the Bund, Sichuan Road, Henan Road, Daxin Street, Yu Qiaqing Road, Ma Road, Tongfu Road, Seymour Road, Hart Road, and Haig Road will retain narrow openings for vehicles and pedestrians, but strict searches will be conducted as usual.

Special Precautions Limited to Today

In addition, special precautions will be taken and appropriate closures will be implemented along the concession border areas, such as the area along Route Ghisi and Haig Road in the Western District, as well as the bridges along the Suzhou Creek in the Northern District, leaving only necessary passages. It is also rumored that the iron gates along the Sino-French border at the southern end of the French Concession will be temporarily closed. Pedestrians entering the concession along the wharves on the Huangpu River on the eastern border will also be subject to strict searches. It is also learned that the two concessions will conduct large-scale searches of public places such as hotels, apartments, tea houses, and printing houses, and have been under invisible martial law since 6:00 PM last night. The deployment time for defense troops and volunteer corps is from 5:00 AM this morning to 11:00 PM tonight, but it may be extended or shortened as appropriate depending on the situation.

Publishing Announcements to Encourage Compatriots

The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters issued a letter to all citizens today, commemorating the third anniversary of the War of Resistance, expressing appreciation for the perseverance and efforts of all circles in maintaining their positions and moving forward in the difficult environment. The Two-Road Party Headquarters, the Seamen's Party Headquarters, and the Three Principles of the People Youth League have also issued announcements to encourage compatriots.

### Admiral Hart Departs Shanghai for Qingdao

He also met with British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr at the British Embassy at noon on the 4th to discuss the Far East situation, and the results were quite satisfactory. It is learned that Admiral Hart has completed his official duties in Shanghai and departed Shanghai on the "Isabel" on the 5th to return to Qingdao to escape the summer heat. However, he is still very concerned about the development of the situation in Shanghai and will continue to closely monitor the evolution of the situation in the Far East and Shanghai after arriving in Qingdao.

### Japanese Side Denies Agreement on French Concession

The North-China Daily News reported that a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy denied yesterday (the 5th), when receiving newspaper reporters, that the French and Japanese authorities in the city had established an agreement to guarantee the integrity of the French Concession, as reported by a certain evening newspaper.

The North-China Daily News reported that the Japanese-language "Continental News" reported yesterday (the 5th) that the U.S. Ambassador to China, Johnson, will come to Shanghai from Chongqing to meet with British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr and French Ambassador Cosme, who have recently returned to Shanghai from Chongqing. It is expected that the diplomatic situation in Shanghai may soon see new developments. The three ambassadors will hold talks in Shanghai to study issues related to the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. It is reported that after the British and French ambassadors arrived in Shanghai in early June, they originally planned to go to Beidaihe for summer vacation as usual, but due to the sudden changes in the European situation, especially France's surrender to Germany and Italy, the future of the two concessions in Shanghai has become complicated, and they were forced to postpone their trip to North China.

### British Ships Between Shanghai and Vietnam Have Suspended Navigation; Defense Forces in French Territories Ordered to Fire on British Ships

The English-language "China Press" reported this (the 6th) morning that the British Consul in charge of navigation affairs in Shanghai has recently ordered British ships sailing between Shanghai and Vietnam not to sail to the French colony. British officials in the city admitted that this order has been issued, but said that this decision by the British authorities is only a temporary measure and should not be taken too seriously. It is because a Washington dispatch this morning stated that the defense forces in French overseas territories have been ordered to open fire on any British ships entering within 12.5 miles of French territory.

Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire Both Affected

The British trading firms Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire, which maintain regular shipping services between Shanghai and Haiphong, are most affected by this order. The interruption of British shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam is another unfavorable development for Shanghai trade. In the first half of this year, imports to the city from Vietnam accounted for 7% of the total. Most of the rice and coal transported to Shanghai come from Vietnam. From January to May this year, Shanghai imported goods from Vietnam totaling 7.7 million gold units, of which rice accounted for 4.4 million gold units and coal accounted for 2.7 million gold units. According to Shanghai customs records, Shanghai's exports to Vietnam in the same five-month period were only 5.1 million yuan, accounting for 1% of the city's total exports. However, a large amount of Shanghai-made goods transported to Hong Kong are often transshipped to Vietnam, mostly cotton cloth and silk made in Shanghai. A large amount of Chinese paper, machinery, miscellaneous items, and steel are also often transported to Vietnam for sale.

Status Quo of Concession Situation Maintained

The sudden deterioration of British-French relations has caused quite a stir among the general public. The diplomatic authorities of the two countries in Shanghai have so far made no statement on this issue. As for the future of the Shanghai concession situation, it was said yesterday by those familiar with the international situation that it should not be affected in any way. The neutral nature of the Shanghai concession has been determined, and the authorities in Shanghai can coexist peacefully and avoid friction even among warring countries. Even if Britain and France break off diplomatic relations, they should be able to understand the difficult situation in Shanghai and do their best to maintain it to avoid giving others an excuse.

Hong Kong Waterways Have Been Mined

According to reliable sources in the shipping industry, the Hong Kong Naval Intelligence Department has notified shipping companies to pay attention to minefields and other dangerous waterways: (1) Isolated minefields, in the area of West Lamma Channel and from Castle Peak to Chu Liu Kok. Under no circumstances should ships of any size approach this area. The boundaries of this area are marked with red flags and lighted buoys. (2) Controlled minefields, in the area of East Lamma Island and Tai Long Channel. No ships are allowed to anchor or fish. Wooden ships may pass through this area unless prohibited by patrolling warships. Steel ships may only enter this area with special permission from the naval authorities. Small steel ships traveling to and from Joss House Bay are allowed to pass through the northeast corner of the Tai Long Channel area, but must travel close to Chau Tsai. The area has been properly arranged to allow ocean-going ships to pass through, but yachts are not allowed to pass through. (3) Submarine obstruction. Small ships should not risk passing through this obstruction. The eastern end of the obstruction area has an entrance for small ships to pass through. The water depth is 10 feet 6 inches, whether the tide is rising or falling. The main entrance is marked with two symbol ships, which are specially for ocean-going ships to pass through. (4) Fat Tong Mun. The waterway has been closed with non-explosive materials to a depth of about 2 feet 6 inches. Small ships can pass through, but they are responsible for any danger. (5) Chu Liu Kok. Ships registered in Hong Kong can pass through the eastern waterway of Chu Liu Island, but they are responsible for any danger. When sailing in this area to within two miles east or west of Chu Liu Kok, they must sail close to Lantau Island, about one mile away, to avoid approaching the closed area of Castle Peak and Chu Liu Kok. (6) Liability for loss. The naval authorities are not responsible for any danger or loss. The managers of the ships should be responsible for the safety of their ships.

"Tai Sang" Ship Only Sails to Hong Kong

Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire have now been ordered to stop all ships bound for Haiphong to avoid attacks. In fact, no ships will sail to Haiphong thereafter. The voyage will be decided again depending on the development of the situation. Butterfield & Swire's "Taiyuan" ship is scheduled to sail to Shantou and Hong Kong on the 8th, carrying only passengers and suspending cargo transportation. The company's "Sichuan" ship sailed on the 5th. The ship normally sails the Shanghai-Haiphong route, but due to the current situation, it has been decided to sail to Hong Kong only. It is reported that some other smaller ships may continue to travel between Hong Kong and Annam. Jardine Matheson's "Tai Sang" ship, which normally sails between Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Haiphong, had just left Shanghai for Haiphong at noon on the 4th, carrying more than 100 passengers. Due to the sudden outbreak of the British-French incident, it was ordered to change its course to Hong Kong. All passengers will disembark in Hong Kong, and those who do not wish to stay in Hong Kong will be returned to Shanghai. Jardine Matheson's "Yu Sang" ship is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow and will stop in Shanghai for one night before changing its course to Hong Kong. The two companies have also stipulated that passenger tickets will no longer be sold to women and children in Shanghai who are going to Hong Kong because Hong Kong is evacuating women and children.

Shanghai-Ningbo Cargo Transportation Becomes More Frequent

In the past week, the cargo from Haiphong on the ships of Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson was not unloaded and was carried back on the original ships. It is reported that all merchants have decided to transship the cargo to Ningbo by Shanghai-Ningbo ships and then go to the mainland. Therefore, Shanghai-Ningbo cargo transportation has been frequent in recent days. Every ship leaving the port is very crowded with passengers and cargo. There are currently more than ten ships sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo. Tomorrow, the "Shan Tai" ship of the Zhengde Company and the "Rui Tai" ship of the Hualun Foreign Company will set sail directly from Shanghai to Ningbo.

### French Concession Fire Department's Situation in June

The French Concession Fire Department released its work summary for June yesterday, as follows: The department extinguished 34 fires in June, five of which used five hoses, and one used six hoses. At the same time, the department's special team rescued a drowning person from the Huangpu River opposite the French Consulate last month and rescued a Chinese person who had been electrocuted. The department's technical department inspected 256 designated restricted buildings, 96 temporary buildings, and 44 large buildings. Ambulances transported patients to various hospitals 200 times.

### Rice Market Price Limit Announcement Announced by the Rice Evaluation Committee; Low-Price Sales and Foreign Rice Subscription Are Being Prepared

The Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee announced to the rice shops and teahouses yesterday morning: "This committee was announced to be established on the 5th of this month, and it has been resolved that from the 6th of this month to September, the market price of various foreign rice will be temporarily based on the price announced by the Bean and Rice Industry Association on the 2nd of this month as the highest price. It is only allowed to operate below this price and not exceed the limit. If any black market activity occurs, it will be reported immediately and severely punished. The market price after the 10th of this month will be evaluated on the 9th and announced again."

Low-Price Sales Measures

It is learned that the fourth phase of low-price sales is scheduled to be implemented on the 16th of this month, and 60 member companies of the Rice Shop Industry Association will still be entrusted to handle it. In order to actively carry out this work, the association has ordered foreign rice from abroad. The first batch of 20,000 bags and the second batch of 40,000 bags have already been shipped and will arrive at the port around the start of the low-price sales. If the foreign rice does not arrive at the port in time for the low-price sales, the association will first start with the 15,000 bags of rice left over from the previous sales. When the scheduled rice continues to arrive, it will be connected. If the stored rice has been sold out and the scheduled rice has not arrived, it will be suspended for a few days. As for the temporary joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees originally scheduled to be held by the Rice Shop Industry Association on the 8th of this month to discuss low-price sales, it is learned that the association has postponed it to around the 12th of this month.

Foreign Rice Subscription

The Shanghai Food Adjustment Association has been working hard for six months and has been deeply trusted by people from all walks of life, who have actively participated and subscribed in large quantities, totaling nearly 50,000 bags. It has made a considerable contribution to the relief of the food panic in the city. Yesterday, the association briefly reported on the actual work situation in the past few months and revised the foreign rice subscription method. The main points are as follows: (1) Groups, organizations, companies, and factories wishing to subscribe to foreign rice should go to the association's office (Room 302, 3rd Floor, YMCA, Eight Immortals Bridge, telephone 84040) to obtain an application form, fill it out according to the format, and submit it with the signature and seal of the responsible representative to the Jiangxi Road Jin City Bank Trust Department, the collection agency designated by the association, and pay a deposit of 40 yuan per bag of foreign rice. Obtain a receipt issued by the association. The collection agency should fill in the receipt number on the application form, indicate that the deposit has been received, and submit it to the association every day. (2) The minimum amount of subscription for each company each time is 50 bags. (3) Subscribers may not cancel or increase or decrease the amount they have subscribed. (4) The type of foreign rice to be subscribed will be decided by the association on its behalf, and the number of bags will also be increased or decreased in proportion to the actual number of subscriptions. (5) The association will deliver the originally packaged foreign rice when the goods arrive, and will not be responsible for the quality of the subscription or the weight loss caused by transportation, drying, breakage, leakage, or corrosion. (6) The association will insure the foreign rice subscribed on its behalf, but if the goods are damaged due to force majeure, the association will not be responsible except for the insurance company's responsibility. (7) The association is not responsible for the delayed arrival or non-arrival of the foreign rice subscribed on its behalf. (8) The storage fee, loading and unloading fee, transportation fee, insurance fee, interest, and other expenses required for the foreign rice subscribed on its behalf will be determined by the association and borne by each subscriber.

Profiting from Speculation

At the meeting of the Ningbo Low-Price Sales Donation Solicitation Conference yesterday, Mr. Yu Qiaqing incidentally expressed his opinion on the food situation in the city, saying that speculative merchants are taking the opportunity to hoard goods and seek huge profits, making a profit of up to 15 yuan per bag of foreign rice. Rice is related to people's livelihood, and a profit of two or three yuan per bag is already heaven-defying. It is hoped that speculative merchants will be inspired by their conscience and take the people's food as the priority.

### New Pacific Hurricane Continuing to Advance

According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the position of the hurricane at 6:00 AM yesterday was at 20 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees east longitude. The center of the wind force was within 60 nautical miles and was still advancing rapidly in a northwesterly direction. According to the reported position, it was about 180 nautical miles southeast of Luzon. The observatory is now watching the development of its journey. In addition, since the 5th, the tide in the Huangpu River has suddenly risen, with a quantity of more than 11 feet, and it will not be able to recover until after the 9th. The autumn tide next month is even more worthy of attention.

### Chapelee Reports to Superiors: Postal Difficulties; Shanghai-Europe Mail Transportation Hindered; Parcel Post to Northwest Suspended

The Continental News reported that the Shanghai Postmaster, Chapelee, went to Kunming at the beginning of last month to report the postal situation here to the General Administration, and will stay in Kunming for ten days before returning to Shanghai. After arriving in Kunming, Chapelee immediately reported to his superiors that after the intensification of the European War, the postal services between European countries and Shanghai have been greatly affected. Furthermore, the deterioration of the situation in Hong Kong and Vietnam has added another obstacle to the post office. Now, the parcel post business between Shanghai and the northwestern provinces of China has been completely suspended. Efforts to rebuild this business have not been successful, and transportation from Shanghai to the mainland via Ningbo is extremely difficult due to poor roads and lack of proper facilities.

### Summary of Important News

The messengers of Reuters in this city demanded that the company accept and agree to pay a rice subsidy of 30%. Messengers with a monthly salary of less than 23 yuan will be given a salary increase. However, the percentage of the increase has not yet been announced. The labor side is satisfied, and all resumed work on the 4th of this month.

Zhu Peisong, Chai Youkang, Zhou Zhisheng, Wang A'gen, and other four foremen of the Hualun Foreign Company's "Rui Tai" ship in this city were arrested at the port of Ningbo on the 2nd of last month by the local defense headquarters on suspicion of being involved in politics. After the company authorities provided a guarantee to the Ningbo authorities, they were released the day before yesterday and have arrived in Shanghai.

It is reported that anyone wishing to swim at the Takahashi Bathing Beach, even if they have a pass, will be prohibited.

### Japanese Side's Proposed White Russian Organization Stillborn; General Russian Community Pleased Upon Hearing the News

The Continental News reported that the Japanese authorities in this city had carefully formulated a plan to organize a new organization under their wings to manage the White Russians, with strong political overtones, so as to impose a "new order" on the more than 25,000 White Russians in Shanghai. It is learned that this plan has failed.

According to sources in charge, senior Japanese officials in Shanghai, after considering this issue for more than a month, decided not to approve the previously planned "Shanghai White Russian Immigrant Association," which contained many White Russians of questionable origins and reputations. It is reported that the existing "White Russian Immigrant Committee" in Shanghai, which manages White Russian affairs, is threatened by the new "Association." Members of the committee are very satisfied to hear the news that the new "Association" will be stillborn. However, they themselves have not received the same news. Mr. Tsurumi Ken, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in this city, said, "This matter is still under consideration." The general White Russian community in Shanghai is relieved to hear this news and hopes that the news is true because they are deeply afraid that once the "Association" is established, it will follow the precedent of Harbin and Tianjin and use "anti-communism" as a guise to oppress and extort, or even kill, White Russian immigrants. Shanghai is now the only city in China where White Russians can live freely. Since the new "Association" has failed, the White Russians in this city can continue to enjoy civil life under the current committee led by Mr. Meitzi.

### Eight Immortals Bridge Vegetable Market to Be Reorganized Starting Today; First-Class Goods to Be Used; Foods for Foreigners Also Sold

In order for residents in the concession to be able to purchase food at a lower price than the current market price, the French Municipal Council has reorganized the Eight Immortals Bridge Vegetable Market. It is now scheduled that from July 7th, each stall in the market will always have goods for foreigners, and the quality of the goods and the hygiene of the vegetable market will be strictly supervised. An agreement has been reached with various importers of livestock and seafood to ensure that the goods in the vegetable market are of the first-class quality. In addition to the meat stalls, fish stalls, egg, chicken, and duck stalls, vegetable stalls, fruit stalls, ice stalls, and flower stalls, there are also foreign shops selling bread and groceries. The vegetable market has convenient transportation. Trolleys on Route 1, Route 2, Route 7, and Route 10, trolleybuses on Route 17 and Route 18, and buses on Route 21 and Route 22 all go directly to the market. Therefore, it is hoped that Chinese and foreign residents will jointly promote the development of the reorganization of the vegetable market so that the Eight Immortals Bridge Vegetable Market can become a food supply center and be comparable to other major vegetable markets in Shanghai. It would be fortunate.

### Ningbo Low-Price Sales Donations Have Reached More Than One Million Yuan; Deadline at the End of This Month

More than 300 people from various industries and enthusiastic fellow townsmen attended. The report showed that the exact amount of donations received, as of yesterday, was more than 1,135,500 yuan. Approximately 400,000 yuan had been recognized but not yet paid. It was resolved that the deadline for donations would be set for the 31st of this month, and a fourth conference would be held at that time to hold the final unveiling. It is also learned that the Zhejiang Provincial Government has allocated 100,000 yuan to cover the expenses for handling the low-price sales in the two prefectures.

### Silver and Money Industry Clearing Preparation Meeting's Eleventh Inspection

The total amount of clearing approved by the preparation meeting was 34,308,300.00 yuan in national currency. The approved amount of use was all below 70% of the collateral valuation, which is in compliance with the regulations. (According to the reporter of the New Voice Agency, the amount of use by each bank and merchant has increased sharply, setting a new record since implementation.)

The total amount of donations to the fund is now close to two million yuan in legal currency.

### Lawyer Zhang Li Talks About Group Life Insurance for Lawyer Organizations

The Shanghai Lawyers Association plans to hold group whole-life insurance. It was previously submitted to the Ministry of Judicial Administration and approved by the association to decide on its own. If a majority approves, it can be implemented. According to lawyer Zhang Li, a member of the association, the principle of group insurance is very much in favor, but there are still some amendments to be made to the outline: (1) If a member dies, regardless of whether the cause of death is natural or accidental, compensation should be paid uniformly to meet the purpose of the association holding group whole-life insurance. (2) There should be a distinction for members who withdraw from the association. Except for those who are subject to criminal punishment or withdraw from the association due to disciplinary action and are not refunded the insurance premium, those who are transferred to serve as officials or voluntarily transfer should be refunded their insurance premium. At present, some members have temporarily joined due to the extraordinary circumstances. When order is restored in the future, they should return to their original place to practice law. (3) Although it is rare for the insurance premium to exceed the insured amount, it cannot be said that it is non-existent. Therefore, generous interest should be given to the extra insurance premium paid. However, this is a personal opinion and can be amended in the future.

### Dissatisfaction with Pension: Senior Police Officers Request Departure; Reportedly, Inspector and Police Superintendent Also Resign; Public Works and Fire Department Personnel Also Plan to Retire

According to the English-language North-China Daily News, it has recently come to light that approximately four Western police officers in the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Police Department, dissatisfied with the pension issue, have reportedly submitted their resignations. Among the more important officers are the well-known Inspector Ross, as well as several police superintendents and deputy superintendents. An SMC spokesperson stated this morning that they had not officially received news of the resignations, but that it was possible. They said that at the moment they could not comment on this. It is reported that Inspector Ross submitted his resignation on July 1st, and the others resigned around the same time. They all feel dissatisfied because the SMC is unwilling to guarantee police officers' pensions. Furthermore, employees of the SMC's Public Works Department and Fire Department are also dissatisfied, and some have submitted their resignations, although their number is smaller than that of the resigning police officers. According to an SMC employee, the SMC should thoroughly investigate this matter to seek a satisfactory solution. If the pension issue sees no progress, then within the year, perhaps more than one hundred employees will submit their resignations.

### At the Entrance of Zhaofeng Garden: Thugs Open Fire and Resist Arrest; One Dead, Two Wounded, Remainder Escape; Handgun and Two Bullets Recovered

Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, a man riding in a rickshaw near the entrance of Zhaofeng Garden was suddenly intercepted and robbed by several thieves. As Jing'an Temple Police Station officers and plainclothes detectives were patrolling nearby, they immediately stepped forward to make arrests. At that moment, a bandit wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and shorts drew a handgun and opened fire on the detectives. Fortunately, the detectives were prepared and were not hit, and immediately returned fire. At that time, gunshots rang out in rapid succession, with a total of twenty to thirty shots fired. As a result, in addition to the bandit wearing the white short-sleeved shirt and shorts having his leg bone broken by a shot, two other bandits wearing Xiangyun gauze trousers were wounded and fell to the ground. The remaining bandits escaped. A handgun and two bullets were recovered from the wounded bandits. The police station dispatched an ambulance to transport the three wounded bandits to the police station hospital on Shanhai Pass Road for treatment. One of the bandits died upon arrival at the hospital due to a serious head wound. His body was then sent to the coroner's office for examination. According to the wounded bandits, one was named Yang Jinlong and the other Zhang Shiyuan.

### Yi Pin Xiang and Jue Lu Hotels Searched by Police Yesterday

The Yi Pin Xiang and Jue Lu Hotels on Yu Qiaqing Road were simultaneously surrounded by red-painted armored vehicles dispatched by the Public Concession Police Department at 8:30 PM the night before, along with a large number of detectives and British merchants. A search lasting approximately half an hour yielded no results.

### Special Martial Law in Nanshi Yesterday

Starting at 6:00 AM yesterday morning, within and outside the city walls of Nanshi, as well as the border between the Chinese, French, the area from Xie Bridge along Zhou Road, Nanyang Bridge, Minguo Road, Xinqiao Street, Xinlao North Gate, Xinkai River, Xiaodongmen and others were all filled with Japanese military police, Japanese soldiers, and puppet police officers, all fully armed, with secret sentry posts. Some even stood on the French Concession side, implementing special precautions. The situation seemed quite tense, and residents felt alarmed. However, someone who entered Fangbang Bridge from Nanyang Bridge, passed through Minguo Road, Jing Road, Jiumudi, Fuyou Road, and exited Xinbei Gate at 9:00 AM did not see Japanese soldiers searching or making arrests. Starting at 11:00 AM, the aforementioned sentry posts suddenly implemented temporary special martial law, cutting off traffic for ninety minutes before resuming. The Japanese soldiers at the sentry posts also gradually withdrew.

Another report states that yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, puppet police stations throughout Nanshi suddenly dispatched large numbers of puppet police and Japanese soldiers to conduct a strict search of the area around Laoximen, Lujiabang, Xiaonanmen, and the Niumudi vegetable market in the refugee area. Residents wearing short clothes and suspicious-looking adults were all arrested. Several women and children were also taken away. Subsequent investigations revealed that over two hundred people were arrested in total. At that time, the citizens were all panicked. It is said that those arrested were detained at the puppet police station, but the reasons for the arrests and the details are unknown.

### Shanghai West Gambling Dens Closed Again Yesterday

After being ordered to close down completely on the 16th of last month by a certain party, the major gambling dens in Shanghai West, after some operators vigorously pulled strings, were able to make a comeback on the 1st of this month, stipulating that they must relocate and change their names. However, the gambling dens have only recently changed their names, which has displeased a certain party. Therefore, they have been given a deadline of five days to relocate to other places to operate, or they will be closed down again. Yesterday was the deadline. Yesterday, a reporter from Huaguang News Agency learned that the gambling dens had automatically ceased operations yesterday afternoon. The so-called Entertainment Relief Association has also been disbanded at the same time, and all employees have been paid half a month's salary.

### Cholera Cases Repeatedly Discovered

Recently, this city has entered the dog days of summer, and the weather is hot, and various seasonal diseases have been repeatedly discovered. According to a Datong News Agency reporter who inquired with the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department yesterday, cholera patients have continued to be discovered in this city in recent days. As of yesterday, a total of eight cases of true cholera have been discovered at the Shanghai Infectious Disease Hospital, all of which have been confirmed by the hospital. Four of them came to Shanghai from Shaoxing to escape the disaster, and the rest were workers and boatmen. Fortunately, they have been properly treated, and the results are good. According to news from the Infectious Disease Hospital, gastrointestinal inflammation has been prevalent recently, and there are many patients. Residents should pay close attention to their diet and daily life.

In the Hongkou area, the Japanese army has been forcibly administering injections, and people entering and exiting Hongkou must carry a vaccination certificate, which must be renewed every three months. Precautions are very strict. However, on the 3rd, a coolie named Liang in Chaoyang Road contracted cholera and was sent to the hospital for treatment. Afterwards, the Japanese authorities disinfected the patient's residence and sent the family to the hospital for examination. It is reported that two young children were found to have bacteria on their bodies. Chaoyang Road was closed to traffic, and door-to-door injections were carried out, and the surrounding residences were disinfected.

### Claim for Guaranteed Debt: Issue of Debt Amount Arises; Defendant Yu Zhewen's Lawyer Defends

Wang Yaqiu, the owner of Maochenghao at No. 5 Rongshou Lane, 6th Malu, Public Concession, a native of Jiangyin, recently hired a lawyer to file a suit with the Special First Court, suing Yuankang Clothing Store at No. 270 Kaige Road, Xujiahui Road, and Zhou Quanjii Printing Factory at No. 14 Haikou Road, Dongxin Bridge, seeking compensation for a guaranteed debt of 1,000 yuan. The Special First Court has issued summonses.

The case was transferred to the Special First Court due to lack of jurisdiction. Yesterday, the case was heard by Judge Gui Yu. The plaintiff's lawyer, Tang Renlian, stated that the two defendants guaranteed a debt of 1,000 yuan for Xiejihang in Shengang Town, Jiangyin. Because the debt could not be collected, he requested that the court order the defendants to repay the debt. The defendants, Wu Kang Clothing Store and Zhou Quanjii, jointly hired Yu Zhewen and Gu Peilun as their lawyers.

They appeared in court and argued that the contract submitted by the plaintiff was entered into by Fuji and Xieji. The subject of the lawsuit has obvious problems. Moreover, according to the debt amount submitted by the plaintiff, the amount in the mediation statement was 2,111.20 yuan, while the amount in the complaint was 2,377.30 yuan, which clearly shows that the amount of the debt he submitted

is not accurate. Moreover, according to the principal debtor's letters to the introducer, there were many disputes between the two parties regarding the accounts. Moreover, the defendant did not waive the right of prior action in the guarantee contract. The court ruled that the truth could not be ascertained without the principal debtor appearing in court, and adjourned the hearing to a later date.

### A Refugee's Lawsuit: Beaten by Shelter Staff; Writes Petition and Appeals for Relief

Now there is a refugee, Jiang Shihai, who spends his days in the shelter, but because he was beaten and humiliated by the staff of the shelter, he has lost his place to rely on. The staff of the shelter have already been fined by the court. Jiang Shihai is not satisfied, so he wrote a petition to appeal and requested to re-enter the shelter in order to receive relief. The details are as follows:

Request for Relief: To the esteemed Editor-in-Chief: I, Jiang Shihai, am from Bishan County, Jiangsu Province. I took refuge here to escape the Sino-Japanese War. I originally rented a loft to live in, but later, due to insufficient funds, I was admitted to the refugee shelter run by the Renji Shantang thanks to Mr. Chen Heqin. I am often bullied and beaten by the staff, as if I were living in hell. On May 9th, I filed a complaint with the Haining Road Police Station. The police station immediately arrested the staff of the Xin Yamen refugee shelter, handcuffed them, and wanted to deal with them. Later, the defendants asked Renji Shantang (No. 35 Yunnan Road) to send Xu Qisong and others to find a way to bail them out. After I filed a complaint with the police station, I was not allowed to enter the refugee shelter. Because of this, I have no food or lodging, and there is no one to turn to for help. I am about to die on the street. Please publish all the details of my situation in the newspaper and request social relief. With respect, Jiang Shihai.

Appeal: Appellant: Jiang Shihai, No. 10, Lane 219, Shandong Road, Ningbo Road. Appellees: Chen Zhonghua (head of the management department and chief regional officer of the Ciyuan Refugee Shelter on North Zhejiang Road), Hu Kegen (chief inspector), Xiao Rong (head of the general affairs department). Being dissatisfied with the first instance judgment, the appellant appeals according to law, and attaches a civil suit. The appellant was previously injured by Chen Zhonghua and others without cause, and filed a lawsuit. The Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court has issued Criminal Judgment No. 249 of the 29th year of the Republic of China, which states, "Chen Zhonghua and Hu Kegen are each fined ten yuan for jointly causing bodily harm. Xiao Rong is not guilty," etc. The appellant finds this judgment difficult to accept. According to the regulations of the refugee shelter, all refugees must have their belongings checked by the doorman before taking them out. Therefore, the appellant took cold rice out every day to burn, and was checked by the doorman before going out. This has been going on for a year and a half, and all the staff know this. It is by no means an act of theft. Moreover, on that day, the appellant was carrying a rice pot and was still inside the refugee shelter, not taking the pot out. The appellees saw this and immediately took the appellant's rice pot away, which was unreasonable. Now the appellees say that "the appellant secretly took cold rice out of the door," which is not true. This is the first point of disagreement. The appellees beat the appellant deliberately and maliciously, and there was no other reason. The original judgment "said that Chen Zhonghua and Hu Kegen were angry for a moment," etc., which is inconsistent with the facts. This is the second point of disagreement. When the appellees beat the appellant, in addition to beating him with a rattan stick, they also used large nails to stab him in ten places, causing his skin to break and bleed, which was inhumane. If the appellant had not shouted loudly for help at the time, he would have been beaten to death. The original trial judgment stated, "The reasoning is that the appellant had purple bruises and swelling on his left and right arms, back, and thighs, and there were stab wounds on his legs." Why does the judgment say that "the facts are that he was angry for a moment and beat Jiang Shihai with a chicken feather duster handle and his hands, causing minor injuries"? This is clearly contradictory and unfair. This is the third point of disagreement. Xiao Rong saw Hu Donggen take the appellant to an empty room, and shouted loudly before the beating. He shouted before the beating. Now the judgment says that the defendant Xiao Rong only arrived at the scene after the fact and declared him not guilty. This is inconsistent with the facts. This is the fourth point of disagreement. In summary, the appellees committed the crime of intentionally causing serious injury. The original judgment only sentenced the appellees to a fine of ten yuan, which is too light and not enough to punish the wicked and protect the good. Therefore, the appellant appeals and respectfully requests your court to overturn the first instance judgment and sentence the appellees Chen Zhonghua, Hu Donggen, and Xiao Rong to severe punishment. In addition to the civil suit, the appellant requests that the court order them to pay for medical expenses and compensation totaling 200 yuan in national currency, and allow him to be re-admitted to the shelter in order to save his life. This would be a great kindness. Respectfully submitted to the Jiangsu Higher Court Second Branch through the Shanghai First Special District Local Court for your consideration. June 17, 29th year of the Republic of China. Petitioner: Jiang Shihai.

### Letter

To Whom It May Concern: According to our client, Zhang Hengsen, manager of Renchang Cotton Cloth, the Shen Bao published a news item on the 5th of this month entitled "Counterfeit Trademark", which contained the phrase "Entrusted to Chen Guoan (i.e., Zheng Guoan), owner of Chang Cotton Cloth Store, No. 12 Jixiang Lane, Henan Road" and was extremely shocked. Zheng Guoan is only a clerk in our store and is neither the owner nor the manager. Therefore, Zheng Jun is responsible for all legal actions outside of his store duties, and our store is not involved. Moreover, according to Zheng Jun, he has not committed any illegal acts of counterfeiting trademarks. This supplementary accusation was made by Shan Xu Nanhua due to a personal grudge. Although the First Instance Court has sentenced him to a fine, he will file an appeal to seek redress. Therefore, we are entrusted to send a letter to correct the mistake and avoid misunderstandings. We hereby send this letter as above, hoping that you will grant the correction. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Pan Renxi, July 6th.

### Military Township Examination

I have observed the dates of the civil and military township examinations. For the civil examination, on the day of entering the examination hall, the chief examiner, supervisor, and education officials all arrange their full staffs, and the examination hall is desolate. As for the military township examination, the yamen officials set up an exercise hall, the military students decorate their clothes and horses, and the spectators next to the horse troughs are like weaving. The clerks enter and leave the city day and night. From horse archery to skill and courage, it takes twenty days. Before the examination, the military students practice their skills themselves, and the period of the horse-worship ceremony is several months. Those who are not insiders must stop and watch when they encounter it. The splendor and brilliance are almost dazzling. Compared with the civil field, the difference is more than a courtyard. At first, this more than a month came to the whole country like crazy, but it was only for dozens of military candidates. Therefore, we know that the court's talent selection ceremony is so important. When we look at it on weekdays, those so-called military candidates, after several metropolitan examinations, are only employed for service and receive one month's salary. This can last for ten or twenty years, or even their whole lives. In the military field examination, archery and horsemanship are the most important, followed by skill and courage. The other four or five military classics are like civil students copying imperial edicts in a small test. If they enter the camp later, archery and horsemanship are only the skills required when the superiors come to inspect. What is valued in killing the enemy is not here. Therefore, regular military officers are not as proficient as those in the military.

### Finance: US Dollar Dumps and Surges Near Noon; US-British Exchange Rate Plummets 13.5 Cents; Rumor that British Merchants Request Government Stabilization

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices showed no changes. In the unofficial US-British exchange market, the selling pressure was difficult to dissipate. Many households were nervous and unable to persist. Although today's US-British exchange rate suddenly fell by a huge 13.5 cents, the opening US dollar was unusually tight. However, by noon closing, it had returned to the previous day's closing price. Moreover, due to rumors that British commercial banks in this city requested the government to stabilize the US dollar exchange rate to prevent it from falling freely, most operators were bullish on the pound. Chinese banks and speculators rushed to sell US dollars, which was very enthusiastic. However, the leading trend was still soft and hard, and current prices were already at the four-office mark, closing at four office zero three one two five. The future is infinitely changeable due to environmental changes, and the tightness and looseness are still dominated by the European war. The futures market is exactly the same as the spot market.

After opening, Chinese merchants and speculators came to sell, and the market showed signs of loosening. HSBC's absorption of July US exchange was six yuan one eight seven five and two five. HSBC's listed price announcement remained unchanged. The silver balance tax announcement reduced by 0.025%. After this, US banks also sold out, selling seven months of US exchange to foreign banks at six yuan two one eight seven five. The existing leading deal had been done at four offices, which was HSBC's intake. Until after half past ten, it was rumored that the British bank requested the government to balance the US exchange rate, which made the public bullish on the pound. At that time, Chinese banks and Chinese speculators vigorously threw seven months of US exchange, and the transaction price was six yuan three one two five. The loosest existing US exchange reached six yuan three four three seven five. The British hard to four offices outside, and the noon closing reported four offices zero three one two five. The US exchange was six yuan three one two five, the British gold in July was four offices, and the US exchange was six yuan two eight one two five. Compared with the previous day's closing price, the British loosened zero seven eight one two five, and the US exchange did not have any honor or disgrace. July British gold also rose zero seven eight one two five, and the US exchange remained unchanged. There is no market on Saturday afternoon.

The US exchange rate spot price tightened by 0.0625 to 5 yuan 6875. The Shanghai exchange rate slightly increased by 2.5 cents to 110 yuan. (The Allied Currency's black market decreased by 1.5 yuan to 91 yuan and 7.5 cents).

### US Currency Rises and Falls Again

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: British and American gold pounds fell by one yuan each along with the price of gold. British gold notes also fell by 30 cents due to the black market British exchange rate breaking through the four pence mark. US gold notes initially rose to 16 yuan 15 cents in the morning due to the sudden surge in the pound price. However, due to ample supply from all parties, the market price gradually fell. As a result, it fell by 10 cents compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes fell by 1 cent. Philippine notes tended to be soft, and the price fell by 10 cents. There was a strong demand for Japanese gold notes, and the evening market rose again to 1 yuan 16 cents. There was no shortage of demand for Korean notes, and the price rose by 5%. The evening market was 98 cents.

### Extremely Short-Lived Buying Sentiment: Gold Price Unable to Rise, Ultimately Drops Another Fifty Dollars

Yesterday's spot gold market situation was erratic and volatile, with the overall sentiment remaining bleak. Operators showed weak buying appetite, with temporary purchases dominating. Furthermore, due to the tightening and infrequent loosening of the foreign exchange market, public confidence waned. The opening price in the morning was 5,150 yuan, and after manipulations by banks and securities firms, it briefly reached a high of 5,170 yuan. Unfortunately, the good times didn't last, and soon gold shops and retail investors took the opportunity to sell, pushing the price down to 5,075 yuan. Subsequently, thanks to renewed buying by money changers, the price recovered to above 5,100 yuan. Unexpectedly, as news of foreign exchange loosening spread and the outlook for exchange rates lengthened, many people inclined to sell, causing the price to plummet again to 5,040 yuan. The closing price was only 5,045 yuan, a drop of 50 yuan compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, due to Saturday's market closure, only 2,000 taels were traded in half a day. Jewelry gold prices initially rose but then quickly returned to their previous levels. Customs gold prices remained stagnant.

Spot Gold Declines for Four Consecutive Days

Since the morning, initially the exchange rate was reported to be lengthening per tael (ten taels), with the US dollar reported to be tightening. However, operators were eager to sell at high prices. Although a certain securities firm took the lead in buying, the price only rose by 55 yuan. The securities firm, together with gold shops, purchased a total of 50 taels at 5,150 yuan. Subsequently, the price continued to rise by 10 yuan, with money changers purchasing 10 taels from banks at 5,160 yuan. Soon after, due to aggressive selling by gold shops and a weakening buying appetite, the price quickly fell by a small 35 yuan, with banks selling 20 taels to gold shops at 5,125 yuan. Afterwards, although the foreign exchange market remained tight, securities firms and banks absorbed at lower prices. Furthermore, as sellers became scarce, the price rose again by 45 yuan, with banks transacting 50 taels with each other at 5,170 yuan. However, due to low public expectations, gold shops again sold aggressively at high prices, and a certain bank and retail investors turned from bullish to bearish. The price soon fell again by 95 yuan, with gold shops trading 30 taels among themselves at 5,075 yuan. Later, a certain money changer aggressively purchased several hundred taels. Although the foreign exchange market was reported to be loosening at that time and retail investors were still selling, the price was eventually lifted by 35 yuan, with gold shops purchasing 10 taels from banks at 5,110 yuan. Eventually, due to the continued loosening of the foreign exchange market and a certain money changer halting purchases to observe, the price once again weakened and plummeted, with banks selling 30 taels to gold shops at 5,040 yuan. Subsequently, gold shops purchased 10 taels from banks at 5,045 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning. As a result, the price fell by 50 yuan compared to the previous day. It has now declined for four consecutive days, a total drop of 385 yuan, with a fluctuation of 130 yuan in half a day. The selling price of current gold by local gold shops, based on spot, is several tens of yuan higher, while the purchase price is reduced by 30 yuan. The spot standard gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with few transactions being made.

Jewelry Gold Rises and Then Falls Back

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at silver shops initially remained at 520 yuan at the Tahong Hang. At 9:40 AM, it increased by a large 10 yuan, and at 11:15 AM, it fell back by a small 10 yuan. There were no changes in the afternoon. In total, the Tahong Hang still kept the original price of 520 yuan. The price at the Xinhong Hang was the same as the previous price, while the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan.

### Financial Commentary

—Up to July 6th—  St. Ke Qiong

(1) Gansu Provincial Bank Increases Capital

The capital increase of the Gansu Provincial Bank has been approved by the Ministry of Finance. At the same time, Chairman Shui Zi and General Manager Xu Yuankun officially took office on July 1st (see the Shen Bao of the 2nd). The Gansu Provincial Bank was established after the outbreak of the war. Its general situation is unfamiliar to the general financial community and those who study the financial situation. A more detailed introduction is provided here for reference by all parties.

The predecessor of the Gansu Provincial Bank was the Gansu Ping City Official Money Bureau, which was used to reorganize the money notes issued by the Gansu Agricultural and Industrial Bank, which had suspended operations. However, due to the lack of reserve funds, it could not be redeemed at that time, and the price fell to 40 strings per yuan. On April 17th of the 22nd year, the Money Bureau issued new notes, divided into four types: ten coins, twenty coins, fifty coins, and one hundred coins. On the one hand, it exchanged old notes for new notes at a rate of one string of new notes for every ten strings of old notes. On the other hand, it stipulated that four strings of new notes were equal to one yuan, and there was no limit to redemption. The bureau was directly under the jurisdiction of the Department of Finance and, in addition to issuing notes, also engaged in remittance, deposit, and other businesses.

After the outbreak of the war, in order to use the institutions of provincial and municipal banks to develop the economy of the northwestern provinces, the government formally reorganized it into the Gansu Provincial Bank on June 1st of the 28th year, adopting a board system. Liang Jingzhang, the director of the Department of Finance, was the chairman, Shui Zi and Xu Yuanfang were the standing directors, and Jia Jiying, Gu Zude, Zhang Wei, and Zheng Enqing were the directors. Li Shijun, Pei Jianzhun, and Shi Kuiling were the supervisors. During the era of the Ping City Official Money Bureau, due to organizational, financial, and other factual reasons, the matters that should be handled could not be handled. Since the reorganization, under the government's financial policy, it has shouldered four important missions: developing local production, promoting inter-provincial trade, expanding domestic finance, and encouraging rural production. Therefore, in August, a trust department was added, with Xu Yuanfang as the director and Ma Gongying and Wu Haoran as the deputy directors. Starting from September 1st, it handled national remittances. In order to assist the province's industry, it specially borrowed 800,000 yuan from the Industrial Cooperative Association to handle various industrial cooperation projects.

The bank currently has branches in Lanzhou, Suzhou, Lintao, Tianshui, Pingliang, etc., and offices in Liangzhou, Ganzhou, Linxia, Jingning, Huixian, Dingxi, Qin'an, Chengxian, Anxi, Yongdeng, Longxi, Weiyuan, Bikou, Zhangjiachuan, and Xifengzhen. Because it was reorganized from the Money Bureau, the issuance business continued to be carried out. According to the report of the bank's issuance inspection meeting on July 29th of the 28th year, as of May of the 28th year, the total amount of issuance was 3,825,622.50 yuan, including 3,597,420 yuan of subsidiary currency notes and 228,202.50 yuan of copper currency notes (912,810 strings).

Gansu Province has always had only one branch of the Central Bank and two offices and agricultural loan offices of the China Farmers Bank. In the 27th year, the Central Bank added an office, and in the 28th year, the Bank of Communications established a branch in Lanzhou and an office in Tianshui. Therefore, there are very few financial institutions. After the establishment of the Provincial Bank, although it can universally establish new-style bank branches and offices to develop the financial economy of Gansu Province, its financial strength is insufficient and cannot bear its important mission. Increasing capital is really urgent.

(2) The Mission of Mr. Song Ziwen's Trip to the United States

Since Mr. Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Bank of China and former Minister of Finance of the National Government, went to the United States, it has attracted much attention from Chinese and foreigners. According to reports from all sides, the figures Mr. Song met with included President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, Undersecretary of State Welles, and British Ambassador to the United States Lord Lothian in the political field, and Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, Reconstruction Finance Corporation Chairman Jones, and Export-Import Bank President Pierson in the financial field. According to people involved, some say it was a social visit, and others say it was to renew friendships, as if Mr. Song's trip was solely for entertaining.

However, entertainment is a technique before carrying out a mission. After the entertainment, it is necessary to move into a normal path. So what is Mr. Song's mission? It can be seen from the classification of the people he met that there are two types: one is a financial mission, and the other is a political mission. The latter should not be discussed here. Regarding the former, personal observations are as follows:

After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the US government's financial assistance to China first included a US$25 million credit loan in December 1938, and then a US$20 million credit loan on March 7, 1940. According to regulations, the US Export-Import Bank could no longer continue to lend after the first loan. However, with the efforts of the Chinese financial delegation, the good credit of the Chinese government in repaying debts, and its strong ability to repay debts, the US government specially ignored the trouble and passed a new law—that is, the US Congress approved the allocation of US$100 million of additional capital of the Export-Import Bank—and amended the foreign loan law to make the second loan possible. The use and guarantee of these two loans were all handled through the China Universal Trading Corporation. On the one hand, credit loans were used to purchase hardware, gasoline, trucks, road construction machinery, mining and smelting machinery, medicines, and other raw materials necessary for construction. On the other hand, tung oil, tin ore, and other raw materials were exported to repay debts, which were needed by American industries. However, after the sudden change in the European situation, Japan was eyeing the Far East. It first proposed to French Indochina to ban the export of resources to China, and then proposed to the United Kingdom to ban exports from Burma. It also surrounded Hong Kong and cut off the passage to Chongqing. How can China and the United States smoothly carry out "each gets what it needs" transactions without being obstructed by Japan? This is the first point of Mr. Song's financial mission. Secondly, the current anti-Japanese construction economic policy of Free China lies in being able to be self-sufficient. According to Economic Minister Weng Wenhao, "As the Japanese are approaching the supply lines of Chongqing, the National Government is making every effort to achieve self-sufficiency. Since the relocation of the capital, the government has issued many laws and regulations to improve and support the production of the rich inland provinces" (see the UPI report of the 4th). However, there is no doubt that it has not yet been fully able to achieve this goal. Then, the various tools needed to improve and support it are of course urgent and massive. Therefore, before the Japanese approach the supply lines of Chongqing, (to be continued)

### Food: Rice Price Evaluation Day 1, Imported Rice High Quality and Sufficient, Limited Transactions

Yesterday morning, the rice market could hardly exceed the previous day's price due to the evaluation. There were no major ups or downs, and it can be said to be stable. In the early market, whether it was the local Zhejiang-Shaoxing merchants or local shops, they all eagerly purchased due to today being a regular Sunday holiday. Therefore, sellers continued to try to maintain prices, but buying was not loose, and transactions were all done at the same prices as the previous day. By the afternoon market, the inland sales volume turned sluggish. Lower-grade goods, such as Tokyo pointed red rice and broken pointed rice, which relied on the routes of those merchants, were seen to soften. As a result, the closing price of No. 1 aged Saigon remained at 66 yuan, 65.5 yuan, No. 2 at 64.5 yuan, 64 yuan, No. 1 Luo Siam at 66 yuan, 65.5 yuan, No. 2 at 64.2-3 yuan, 64 yuan, Fire Twisted at 65.5 yuan, 65 yuan, Hong Kong Pointed at 64.5 yuan, 64 yuan, 63.3 yuan, 63 yuan, while Tokyo Pointed was only 62 yuan, second grade 60 yuan, Haiphong Red Rice 61.5 yuan, 61 yuan, Mixed Broken 53 yuan, second grade to 50 yuan, Rice Tea 57 yuan, 56 yuan, second grade 54 yuan, a depreciation of 5-6 jiao. Only high-grade goods were firm and sufficient with limited transactions. For returned goods, 26 packs of No. 2 Siam rice opened at 72 yuan, jumping up by 1 yuan, and then increased by another 5 jiao to 72.5 yuan. 18 packs opened at 75 yuan, but the sellers shouted 1 yuan higher, without reaching an agreement. A total of 150 tons were traded.

The source of japonica and glutinous rice was still only nearly 1,000 bags of japonica rice arriving at the port. In terms of sales, it was rumored that the off-market price of japonica rice was still normal, so the selling price did not change and remained similar to the previous market. However, glutinous rice was still fragrant due to the lack of goods and continued to increase by half a yuan. Jin Piao Special Yuan 66 yuan, Chang Dan Bai Yuan 64.5 yuan.

### Wheat Flour: Raw Material Scarcity

—Must Rely on Imported Wheat—

Wheat Flour: Yesterday's flour supply, in addition to Fufeng Factory maintaining sales within the street, Fuxin Factory continued to suspend sales. However, 20,000 to 30,000 bags of inland miscellaneous brands of flour were newly transported to Shanghai. The green phoenix and other brands produced by the Shanghai-Japan factory were available for forward delivery. Those who needed it had to transfer to them. It was heard that yesterday's price of Double Lions Jinshan was 16.23 yuan, the spot price of Green Phoenix was 16.35 yuan, and the forward price for July-August delivery was 16.43-5 jiao yuan, with 4,000 to 5,000 bags being traded. Fufeng Factory also released about 5,000 bags of old car spleen, maintaining the original price of 15.2 jiao. It was also heard that merchants from other provinces purchased 2,000 to 3,000 bags of returned goods of No. 3 and No. 4 flour, and the selling price was equal to the factory price.

Wheat: Yesterday, the source of new wheat was endless, with a total of 9 cars arriving, totaling more than 10,000 bags, but they were all monopolized by Japanese factories. The transportation permits for Chinese factories have not yet been officially issued. Therefore, Fuxin Factory recently ordered a ship of Australian wheat. It was heard yesterday that Fufeng Factory also ordered a ship of Australian wheat, reportedly more than 3,000 tons, with the price still around 30 yuan. Later batches are still under negotiation. During this period of new wheat flooding the market, they are urgently seeking foreign wheat. This is also being dominated by the environment.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Rebounds Slightly

Securities: The black market saw a slight recovery yesterday, with various bonds showing relative weakness. Ding bonds fell more. The afternoon was slightly stronger than the morning, probably because some of the floating surplus came out, and there were few new buyers. Bullish news has not yet been confirmed, and due to the relationship on Saturday, those doing me are at a disadvantage, so they are temporarily in a state of stagnation. There are many changes in the future, which cannot be reversed. Yesterday morning, Jiufeng Lianhe made up for the short positions, and Lianyi and No. 35 were slightly bought. Lemao, Tongshun, Renchang, Defu, etc. were all sold, and the market was slightly more bearish. The morning closing was slightly down by 3-4 jiao. In the afternoon, Renchang bought back Class A, Shuntai Runli bought Class C, and retail investors also had needs. Hongkang, Hongda, and Yitai were all sold, but the demand was still greater than the supply. Various bonds recovered by 2-3 jiao. As a result, it turned down by 5 fen 1 jiao to 3 jiao. The total number of transactions was about 700,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below:

Stock trading: 50 shares of Xinxin Company were traded at a price of 10 yuan.

London, 5th (Friday) Electricity, today's stock market listings of various Far Eastern British companies were generally stable. Only the British registered shares of HSBC Bank continued to rise by £2 to £65. Hong Kong registered shares remained unchanged, and there were no other ups and downs.

London, 5th (Friday) Electricity, today's Chinese foreign debt market listings were still stable. There were no changes in the upper and lower bonds.

### Yarn and Cotton: After Major Players Absorb, Yarn Market Rises

Yarn Market: The market is good, and the situation has improved. This is because the actual transactions have progressed, and Hong Kong is purchasing very heavily. It is said that goods can be loaded at Guangzhou Bay. Therefore, the purchasing power of the Hong Kong gangs has increased. At the same time, the demand from the Ningbo gangs is also active. Therefore, people's confidence is boosted. A certain company in the market has taken in 400 to 500 bales of single yarn from the Shuangma factory, and the table is showing signs of tightness.

The morning opening of the current yarn was still flat, because there were no major changes in the overseas cotton market, but the foreign exchange rate shrunk again. The market price of Shuangma was flat at 885 yuan. Then it was heard that the Guang gangs were eagerly searching for current yarn, and the market传传 Jiangxi gangs also had transactions. People's confidence suddenly tightened, and the market gradually rose. After the chips of retail investors in the market were taken in by major players alone, they became more dry, and the multilateral parties took the opportunity to absorb and rise. The closing price was 922 yuan, and the closing price was 922 yuan. The half-day transaction statistics were 3,110 bales. The price of 20-count Shuangma rose by 37 yuan. The amount of purchases by each gang is listed separately on the right.

Current cotton transactions still lack development. Only Japanese factories have a slight need, and the silver payments are slightly delayed. All transactions are in Indian cotton prices, which are also ordinary. However, yarn sales have slightly improved, and the sentiment in the cotton market is slightly better. However, each store has abundant goods on hand, and the tight silver supply has a significant impact on the market.

A batch of American cotton arrived in Shanghai yesterday, shipped by the American President Lines' Doctor Lvkes, with more than 900 pieces. It arrived at the port yesterday afternoon and docked at Qichang Wharf in Pudong for unloading.

Another message on foreign cotton market prices, yesterday the New York cotton market rose slightly in the early morning due to public purchases, and then fell because spot merchants sold out and multi-heads closed in the near future. As a result, the closing price in the near future fell by 23 pounds, and the far future only fell by 2-3 pounds. The Indian market was quiet. Yesterday, it quickly predicted that it would rise by 1 rupee.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trade has always been very quiet recently. Except for a part of Japanese factories purchasing and releasing loans for spot goods for one or two days, each colleague is limited by limited silver and cannot sell in large quantities. Chinese factories have sufficient inventory to meet current needs, so there are no transactions reported for the time being.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Tightens

Yesterday, according to Dutch telegrams, the Dutch East Indies will collect a small export commodity defense fee from today, at 2% of the value. Sugar is also included, and the cost will inevitably increase. Therefore, the market is slightly tight. The association's fixed price, the current spot price of 24 coarse white is 68 yuan at the local warehouse, and the price at the foreign warehouse is 67.6-8 jiao in the morning and 7 jiao in the afternoon, both up 2 jiao. Transit goods 53.4-6 jiao, delivery on July 10th 53.8 jiao, both up 6 jiao, delivery on July 20th 54.6 jiao, Taikoo car white has not changed much, B mark 78 yuan to 78.1 jiao, DY mark 76.5 jiao, Dutch red rose by 4.5 jiao to 57.5 jiao, no transactions. The factory's snow white is 68.5 yuan, up 5 jiao. The original price of the factory's ice sugar has not moved. For national sugar, the Guang gang has opened 200 packs of Hainan red, 51 yuan to 50.07 jiao. The Jian gang has opened 50 packs of oil bag Diaoqing, 64.5 yuan.

### North-South Goods: Green Bamboo Shoots Expected to Rise

Since the price of green bamboo shoots has fallen, the settlement period for customer goods has recently arrived. Customers are not satisfied, and inventory is not willing to be sold cheaply. Therefore, the market may tighten today, with larger ones increasing by 1-2 jiao per small basket, because the cost is difficult to loosen. The goods of Guancaiji's fatty and particularly high-quality goods are particularly strong and still cost 3 yuan.

### Piece Goods: Price Cut of Palekis Promotes Sales

The market for Palekis has been flooded recently, and the mainstream market price has been falling. The goods from this factory and the Dong goods are visible in the market. In fact, sales have been affected because the price is more than double the previous year's price. In the past, ordinary ones were usually bought for about 1 yuan per foot, but now they are sold for 3.35 yuan. Sales of Chinese clothing materials have been reduced by more than half, and the route for Western suits requires high-quality, thick materials. In addition, the sales period has passed for the most part. Although there is an outlet in the autumn, the number is limited. Since the armistice between France, Germany, and Italy, sellers have mostly shifted their concepts and are willing to sell the Palekis category at a reduced price, unlike other woolen fabrics that are firm and hoarding for profit. Looking at the gray plain Palekis of each brand, on average, the selling price per yard has fallen by 7-8 jiao compared to last weekend.

### Hardware: Ribbed Steel Bars Fall Again and Again

Ribbed steel bars have recently been sluggish in sales, and the market price has fallen several times. It first fell from 1,500 yuan, and then reduced to 1,300-400 yuan. Recently, it has fallen to 1,250 yuan (this is for 3-4 fen goods), and the asking price for 5 fen to 1 inch patterns is only 1,200 yuan per ton, a decrease of several tens of yuan compared to the previous price. The only sales route for this product in Mu埠 should be the construction gang, but recently, the construction gang has adopted very little. In addition, the overseas customer gang business is also stagnant and has no spirit. Therefore, the current transactions are extremely desolate. Also, 1,500 pieces of galvanized iron came from the United States yesterday.

### Coal: Korean Coal Dust Appears on the Market

Hongji white coal dust, in addition to supplying coal ball raw materials, has no other use. In recent months, various industrial factories have also replaced furnaces and switched to white coal dust because the price of bituminous coal is expensive. Therefore, the route has become more smooth and the market has been firm. Someone saw that there was a profit to be made, and a so-called new Korean white coal dust was brought to the market for activity, cutting prices for cash, but because the quality is inferior, it cannot be sold.

### The American Political Situation and the European War

"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness..." This is a section from the Declaration of Independence passed by the American National Congress on July 4, 1776, and it has been the cornerstone of the American spirit of democracy for 164 years. In this important period when the two major forces of democracy and autocracy are competing for growth in the world, this declaration of independence is naturally more meaningful.

US Secretary of the Army Stimson said, "Long-range bombers have extended the US defense line to the far reaches of the Atlantic, including Puerto Rico, Bermuda, Newfoundland, and northeastern Canada. A strong enemy can bomb our eastern coast if they gain a base in any of these places. Our country's national defense problems have become even more serious. Today, our country still has time to reorganize, relying on the fact that Britain can still control the North Atlantic. In this situation, assisting British maritime power in the North Atlantic has a very important impact on our own interests." In this way, the US eastern defense line has extended to the North Atlantic, which reminds people of the British former Prime Minister Baldwin's saying that the British defense line is on the Rhine.

President Roosevelt was elected in November 1932 and was re-elected in 1936. The statutory term of office is four years, which will expire on January 20 next year. The Republican Party nominated electrical industry tycoon Wendell Willkie as its presidential candidate last month on the 28th. The Democratic Party will hold a national convention in Chicago on the 14th of this month to nominate the presidential candidate. Before the Republican Party held its national convention in Philadelphia, New York District Court Prosecutor Dewey, Senator Taft, and Vandenberg were the most vocal in competing for the presidential nomination. Why did a Dark Horse Willkie emerge? This change in the situation was completely influenced by the European war. Dewey is very young and seems to lack the experience to deal with the crisis. Moreover, he has repeatedly published extremely isolationist political views during the competition for the primaries. Later, the European situation changed drastically, and this idea of "sweeping the snow in front of your own door and not caring about the frost on other people's roofs" became untimely. Taft and Vandenberg also advocated isolationism in their campaign speeches, so they were all defeated. Willkie debuted late and has not made any self-imposed remarks. He was able to follow the trend of public opinion and express his support for Britain. His cadres and national public opinion mostly supported him in breaking the precedent and competing for the third presidential term, but he himself remained silent. According to American political commentator Sullivan, American public opinion changes every day. The degree of American aid is directly proportional to how dangerous Britain is. From now until the November election, if the European war has stopped, then American public opinion will return to domestic affairs, and Roosevelt's position will inevitably be extremely unfavorable. Because everyone understands that Roosevelt's chances of becoming president for the third term depend on the American public's attention to the war. If domestic issues are the campaign theme, Roosevelt's chances of being elected will decrease. In short, the future of the American political situation still needs to depend on the development of the European war.

### The Lineage of Churchill

— Lin

Winston Churchill, the wartime prime minister of Britain, hails from a distinguished family with a history of holding prominent positions. His achievements are remarkable and unique, setting him apart from other major British politicians. He enjoys widespread popular support and universal admiration. His appointment to handle difficult situations stems entirely from the people's endorsement, distinct from those who leverage political parties for personal gain. This truly embodies the spirit of democracy.

What kind of person is Churchill? This question can be answered by his biographers. Biographers must examine a person's life and achievements, much like an artist who captures a person's likeness by meticulously observing their facial features. Though different paths, they arrive at the same destination. Currently, our knowledge is limited, at best, resembling the perspective of a photographer.

Everything that we can know about Churchill seems to be known thoroughly. The ups and downs of his life, his robust physique, his serene smile, his sharp replies, and his public speeches delivered in harmonious tones are all vividly imprinted in people's minds.

How then do we understand him as a person? How did Churchill rise from a private in the army to wartime prime minister? Does he possess a unique quality that allows him to integrate all aspects of himself into one? We cannot help but look to his origins.

If we examine his family history and compare it with his past achievements, we will find that Churchill's characteristics are quite different from what one would expect of the grandson of the Duke of Marlborough. Churchill's style does not resemble that of a duke's descendant. In his political career, he embraced liberalism with sincerity and courage, disliked the aristocracy, and sought to weaken aristocratic power through heavy taxes and limiting the number of seats in the House of Lords. None of his thoughts or actions indicate his noble origins. Could it be that his maternal ancestry, being American, accounts for his unique sense of justice?

His father, Randolph Churchill, intended to marry Miss Jerome of New York. The Jerome sisters were originally a pair of beauties, but he only loved the "dark beauty". The mother of the two daughters was living in Paris at the time. The Duke was somewhat surprised upon hearing the news, and even Mrs. Jerome found it uninteresting. In 1873, crossing the Atlantic for a marriage was unprecedented. The young couple could only wait for their parents' love and approval. Before the end of the year, the lovers finally became a couple, and Londoners knew that the Duchess of Randolph was a lively dark beauty.

The wedding feast was grand, and distinguished guests gathered, starting with Prince Edward, all coming to offer congratulations. Disraeli, the old statesman, sat before his table, drinking brandy and water, turned his head, and facing the host, mumbled in a peculiar tone, "My dear Randolph, I have sipped champagne, emptied the wine, and drained the Badminton cup, and I don't want to drink any more." Such was his wit. The newlyweds found themselves in society, appreciating their own unique qualities. The groom began his career as a Conservative Party member. However, shortly after the marriage, they inevitably faced some financial challenges. Meanwhile, a child was born in the upstairs nursery, and they named him Winston Leonard Spencer. The first and last names were derived from Churchill's family, and the middle name was taken from his maternal grandfather, Leonard Jerome of New York City.

Churchill's life initially showed no traces of his transatlantic heritage. With his prestigious family background and handsome youth, it was natural for him to attend Harrow School and the Royal Military Academy. By 1896, the British army was inactive. Churchill retired and sought opportunities abroad, finally finding them across the Atlantic. At the time, the Spanish army was struggling with Cuban guerrilla tactics and was overwhelmed. Churchill joined the Cuban army as a cavalryman. This was the first time his hidden New York heritage was revealed externally.

Later, he served in the British regular army, fighting on the Northwest Frontier of India. Soon after, he travelled to the Sudan in Africa. At that time, Lord Kitchener was using troops on the upper reaches of the Nile, avenging the murdered Gordon, and severely punishing the local rabble outside Khartoum.

Before long, British troops were deployed to South Africa; Churchill departed as a war correspondent and was captured by Dutch immigrants. He relied on his intelligence and bravery to escape safely after a month.

After the end of the Boer War, Churchill left the military and engaged in social work. In reality, this "Cuban cavalryman" was already a statesman. The situation on the other side of the Atlantic was similar. Colonel Roosevelt was elected Vice President the same year Churchill entered Parliament. Not only did Churchill and Roosevelt's entry into politics coincide, but their style of resisting tyranny was also similar. Not long after the United States launched a severe attack on the "rich and unkind", Churchill also used his rising power to strike a blow against large landowners and hereditary aristocratic members of parliament.

Churchill was then a member of the left-wing Liberal Party, relying on Lloyd George as his right-hand man when he was in power. He used his eloquent and powerful speeches to attack the opposition with all his might, often saying, "The Liberal Party is the hope of millions of wandering and homeless people."

The year was 1910, and the world situation was becoming increasingly grim. At that time, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany was meticulously planning to destroy Britain. The Germans were building up their military and building ships on a large scale. The British looked out over the North Sea, feeling confused and disoriented. Churchill was then serving as Home Secretary. One day, armed police officers in London's East End raided a foreign anarchist organization. The two sides exchanged gunfire, and Churchill himself went to the scene to investigate. The people of the country were a little surprised by what this "Cuban cavalryman" was doing. In 1911, Churchill was transferred to the position of First Lord of the Admiralty, where he devoted all his energy to planning national defense policies. Churchill, originally from the military, had now become a naval expert as a messenger. At that time, he had to expand the army due to the situation.

In August 1914, the European war broke out. One night, Churchill swayed in from the outside to No. 10 Downing Street to inform the cabinet ministers that the war orders had been notified to all ships. The British fleet repeatedly shone in the ocean. At this time, the "Cuban cavalryman" had overshadowed many politicians. All his previous overzealous actions were forgiven because of his great achievements. In the last phase of the war, Churchill served as Minister of Munitions, making many changes to everything he did.

Churchill, having experienced the hardships of the world, became more and more experienced. His political style changed from the past and became closely connected with the Conservative Party. In 1917, the Russian Revolution broke out, and Churchill was heartbroken, expressing reservations about the actions of the Red Party. Later, as he became more and more conservative, Churchill became politically isolated. But a brave politician cannot be lonely and shrink back. Churchill then served as Chancellor of the Exchequer for five years.

At this time, Baldwin was popular, and the gold standard still existed, while Hitler had not yet emerged. Later, when the two elders, Baldwin and MacDonald, were in power, they retreated blindly, and Churchill's rough style had no place for heroism. He finally resigned, like the angry prophet Jeremiah, shouting loudly in the wilderness.

However, everything the Germans did was predicted by Churchill. When the fires of war rose, Churchill was entrusted with the heavy responsibility of the people and made a comeback. Eight months later, he was promoted to Prime Minister and was about to lead the British Empire to a final victory against Hitler. (Translated from the New York Times)

### Churchill: A Man of Both Literary and Military Talent

### A Grand Record of the Second New York World's Fair

— EL

The New York World's Fair caused a sensation last year. It was truly as President Dill of the San Francisco Golden Gate International Exposition said: the New York World's Fair is the greatest event ever seen before or since, a once-in-a-lifetime experience. This year's fair is its second session, lasting from May 11 to October 27, a total of one hundred and seventy days and nights.

The results of last year's fair were not entirely satisfactory. The fair authorities have made major reforms in this year's second session in order to attract more visitors and generate greater revenue. The reasons for last year's failure were first, that it was too serious, and second, that the fees were too high. This year, efforts have been made to avoid these two shortcomings. From the opening ceremony onwards, everything is simple and casual, and the formalities of "top hats and white hard collars" have been largely omitted, striving for "commoner" appeal. Therefore, the form of the opening day was nothing more than drama and entertainment. The biggest feature this year is the addition of countless amusement venues, called the Great White Way, symbolizing New York's most bustling street, with brilliant lights at night.

Ticket prices, which were as high as 75 cents last year, have been reduced to 50 cents this year. Parking fees have also been reduced to 25 cents, and food and other expenses have also been made more affordable, with canteens offering meals for 5 cents and 10 cents, allowing visitors to eat their fill at the lowest cost. Other expenses, such as travel and accommodation, have been made cheaper than in previous years to the extent possible. The fair authorities have also focused on publicity and prize giveaways, with a golden key contest offering visitors the chance to win a car for free, as an attraction.

This year's fair has "Peace and Freedom" as its slogan. Last fall, when the first World's Fair was in full swing, the situation in Europe suddenly changed, followed by the outbreak of war. The beautiful world was instantly transformed into a battlefield. Although the United States was not involved in the whirlpool, it was disheartened by the increasing recklessness of the aggressors and wanted to promote peace and freedom in this gathering of nations. Therefore, on the opening day, many places were dedicated to expressing this good intention.

The venue is in the Brooklyn district of New York, with very convenient transportation. It is only a fifteen-minute train ride from the most bustling Manhattan district. It covers an area of 1,216 acres and is divided into two major sections: exhibitions and amusements. The design and construction costs of the entire venue have reached US$155 million. After the closing, all but the main buildings will be demolished and converted into a large park, as a permanent recreation area for the citizens. The venue opens at 9:00 AM every day, and the main exhibition halls open at 10:00 AM. The exhibition section closes at 10:00 PM. The amusement venues close at 2:00 AM.

Grand Opening

This year's World's Fair opened at noon on May 11. The ceremony was simple and full of vitality. There are a total of twelve entrances to the venue, and the opening ceremony was held at the East Entrance. Many people eager to see the excitement were waiting there early in the morning. At noon, New York Mayor LaGuardia officially cut the ribbon to open the fair. He said at the time, "I now formally open the 1940 New York World's Fair." The original English words were only nine words in total. At that time, the American national anthem was played, airplanes soared above, troops paraded, flags fluttered, and in addition, there were thousands upon thousands of men and women, a spectacle never seen before.

At 2:00 PM, a dedication ceremony was held in "Peace Square", completely centered on the fair's slogan of "Peace and Freedom". At that time, New York Governor Lehman addressed an audience of 20,000, saying that the United States must strengthen its army, navy, and air force, so that "no country, or several countries, dare to invade us". President Roosevelt also sent a letter to the conference, saying, "This is a manifestation of international common sense, and the exposition should achieve great success." The mayor spoke, explaining that there were no German or Soviet exhibits in the second session, saying that the exposition "must not allow these two international rogues to participate in it."

The ceremony was presided over by the Chairman of the World's Fair Board, Gibson. During the ceremony, 6,000 American Boy Scouts formed a living American flag in front of the square. At the same time, there was a grand parade of more than 10,000 people, including Boy Scouts, the US Army, Navy, National Guard, and representatives from sixteen countries, and the public. Among the representatives of the sixteen countries, the Netherlands held the first honorary position, followed by Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, and Sweden.

Five girls from the countries at war with Germany—Belgium, the Netherlands, England, France, and Norway—wore their national costumes and held their national flags, forming a separate group in the parade to show their respect. Leading the parade was a twenty-five-year-old American girl named Qiqiu, representing the spirit of "Peace and Freedom". She wore a white robe and blue skirt, with a graceful figure, and was guarded by twelve men (To be continued)

### How to Practice Calligraphy During Summer Vacation (Part 1)

— Shen Baiying

A few days ago, I was invited by an elementary school to give a lecture, and I talked about this topic. Now I am copying it down and publishing it in the newspaper for the benefit of everyone.

Dear children, don't you have holiday homework during the summer vacation? There are many self-study subjects, and calligraphy is one of them. Judging from the current situation, calligraphy is not as important as reading or general knowledge, but you can't go without practicing it for the entire summer vacation. As the saying goes, "A fist must not leave the hand, and a song must not leave the mouth." Anything that requires practice should be reviewed every day and cannot be stopped. Once you stop, you will become unfamiliar and regress. So I would like to add another sentence to this saying: "When practicing calligraphy, you must not leave the tip of the pen." Although school is on summer vacation, calligraphy must not be put on vacation as well. Not only must it not be put on vacation, but you must practice diligently every day without interruption. If you don't practice at all during the entire summer vacation, when school starts after the vacation, the writing you produce will be like the work of two different people.

Some of you may ask, "What tools should I use to practice calligraphy during the summer vacation?" My answer is that from the perspective of the new era, and based on the application in today's society, pencils and fountain pens are used more often than brushes. Therefore, you cannot only use brushes when practicing. The best way is to write large characters with a brush and small characters with a pencil or fountain pen, using both at the same time, without favoring one over the other, so that you don't lose out.

Some of you may also ask, "How should I allocate my practice time?" I can explain it in two ways: The best time to practice during the day is in the morning, because it is cooler in the morning, and it is not easy to get tired when writing. The ideal length of a single practice session is about twenty to forty minutes. If the time is too short, the muscles will not have become skilled, and if you stop suddenly, you will not get any real benefit, as if you had not practiced at all. If the time is too long, you will inevitably become mentally and physically exhausted, and there will be no progress, which is also not appropriate. Therefore, using time appropriately is also an important condition.

Some of you may also ask: "When we practice calligraphy at school, we have copybooks distributed by the teacher, and we can imitate the model characters written by the teacher. If we practice at home, what do we write from?" My answer is:

### Originally, It Was the Same Thing

— Yu Qing

Let Me First Introduce a Painting

"This picture is a bit strange," the children must say. "That's right, this picture is a bit strange, and what's even stranger is that it's also a very good composition!" When I say this, the children will feel bewildered.

This is a picture drawn by an Indian who had not yet discovered writing, and it is also the writing they used and the composition they made to record their deeds and express their ideas.

In fact, this picture composition is not difficult to read. The five canoes, with many people in them, indicate that they crossed the lake to attack the enemy. The man riding the horse is clearly their leader. This attack lasted for three days, because there are three suns under the three brackets representing the sky. The bear and the eagle indicate that the victory of this attack was due to their bravery in battle. The strange beast, said to be a leopard, is the leader's name. The snake below indicates that they all returned in triumph, with no one killed.

In this way, isn't this a very good narrative composition?

Take our Chinese characters, for example. They were originally pictures. The characters "日" (sun) and "月" (moon) that we write now were written as "　" and "　" in ancient times. Aren't these pictures of the sun and the moon? So drawing pictures, writing characters, and writing compositions were originally the same thing, and they were only separated later.

Let Me Give Another Example

Suppose you are walking on the road, and someone gives you a piece of paper with two place names written on it. It turns out they are asking you for directions. After a little thought, you tell them the route, telling them to first walk in that direction, cross several roads, then turn there, and pass by some places before reaching their destination, and that there are some special landmarks in that place.

But you have been babbling on for a long time, and he is still at a loss. It turns out that he is a Cantonese who has just arrived in Shanghai, and he cannot understand your authentic Shanghai dialect.

You have no choice but to take out your notebook and pencil, tear off a piece of paper, and write down the route in detail and give it to him, telling him to follow it.

But again, unexpectedly, he still stares at you and shakes his head. It turns out that he is illiterate, and that piece of paper with the place names was written by someone else.

This makes you embarrassed. What will you do? I think you will probably tear off another piece of paper and draw a detailed map of the route, pointing it out to him. Only then does he nod to you, thank you profusely, and happily follow your instructions.

If you do this, you will naturally use three tools - writing, composition, and drawing. These three tools have a common purpose, which is to express your own ideas and make others understand your ideas. A Simple Ruler

To know the length of something, we can use a ruler to measure it. To know the weight of something, we can use a scale to weigh it. It would be best if the characters we write, the compositions we make, and the pictures we draw also had something like a ruler and a scale that we could use to measure them. This is difficult. Writing characters, writing compositions, and drawing pictures have neither length to measure nor weight to weigh, so there is no way to measure them. However, the common purpose mentioned above can be used as a simple standard to roughly measure the quality of compositions, writing, and drawings. Until a better ruler and a better scale are found, we can reluctantly use it.

That is to say, whether your composition, writing, or drawing is good or bad depends on whether others understand the meaning you are expressing, and whether they understand it thoroughly.

For example, if you draw a picture of a tiger, and others say, "This looks like a dog," it is obvious that there is something wrong with your drawing. If you draw a landscape painting and plan to have people admire it, to evoke a sense of beauty, but people look at it and shake their heads, saying, "It's extremely ugly," then your painting has completely failed.

The same is true of compositions. For example, if you write a composition describing the lives of the poor people in Shanghai, wanting to evoke sympathy, but after reading your essay, people say, "Their lives are still quite comfortable," then it is obvious that your article is irrelevant. As for the characters you write, the most important thing is of course that they are written correctly, without errors, clearly, so that people will not look at them and not recognize your characters, leading to misunderstandings.

This is of course the most basic standard, and it is ridiculously simple. However, children may wish to try using it to measure their own compositions, writing, and drawings, and it may be of some help. This time, the Shen Bao is hosting a holiday homework competition, which specifically designates these three tasks. Children may wish to conduct an experiment and see if this ruler is of any use after all.

### Shirley Temple's Autobiography (9)

— Min

But you must know that even though it is acting, you must do it with your heart and effort. I remember one day, when I was practicing a performance in the "Little Colonel" scene, Director Butler suddenly raised his hand and said, "Shirley, this scene, your performance is not lively enough, please try again!" I was very unhappy when I heard Mr. Butler's words, and I almost cried. However, I finally followed his words and tried again with my heart. That day, Mr. Butler cheered and said, "That's good, dear, that's how you should do it!" And I was still happy.

This was the first time I felt that what Mr. Butler said was indeed correct, so after this scene was filmed, I walked up to him and said softly, "Mr. Butler, I think the performance just now was indeed terrible." Then I smiled at him slightly, meaning, "We understand each other, don't we?" Mr. Butler seemed to have picked me up and kissed me on the cheek, but I don't remember that.

However, I owe everything to my mother. If it weren't for her instructions, I wouldn't know how to perform. Whenever I was about to start working and star in a film, she would first tell me the story in detail. I still remember when they first called me to perform "War Baby," they gave me a script. My mother took me to a secluded corner of the studio, and she read the script once. It only took a few minutes, because this film was a short reel, and the whole thing only took more than ten minutes to show. Now, when you watch the films I star in, they often take more than an hour, which is very different. After she read the script, she told me the story and kept asking me, "Do you understand, dear? Do you understand completely?"

When we drove home from the studio, I asked my mother to tell the story again. Before she explained it, she told me who was acting with me in this film, who was playing the colonel, and who was playing the politician? I didn't understand what a colonel was or what a politician was, so I had to keep asking, and my mother had to explain it to me in detail.

When we got home, after dinner, my father gave me a bath, put on a bathrobe, and sat in the bathroom. My mother came to fix my curly hair, then went to the bedroom, lay down on the bed, covered myself with the quilt, and said to my mother, "Mom, I'm ready." My mother hurriedly closed the door, took the script book, sat on the edge of my bed, and read it to me sentence by sentence. Sometimes it was as long as a whole page, and sometimes it was more than a page. These scripts were contained in the story. I followed what my mother read, reading sentence by sentence, five or six times. Then she said to me, "Dear, you must be happy when you read these lines of dialogue." After my mother heard me read it fluently, she closed the book, and I had to remember these lines firmly, preparing to use them when I went to work at the studio the next morning.

### From Yang Shengchun's Arrival in the South to Remembering Yang Xiaolou

— Plum Blossom Pavilion Owner

Yang Xiaolou, known as a master of the national opera, has been dead for almost three years now. At this time, Yang Shengchun, a Wusheng performer of the Yang school, has come to the South, and I cannot help but feel nostalgic and filled with emotion! Since Yang's death, those who flaunt the title of Yang school Wusheng include Sun Yukun, Liu Zongyang, Yang Shengchun, and Gao Shenglin. Liu is Yang's grandson. From childhood to adulthood, he was always by Yang's side. Among all, Zongyang knew Yang's voice, appearance, and smile the best, and he gained the most from it. If Zongyang could have been determined to improve and study diligently, then the person who could inherit Xiaolou's mantle would undoubtedly be Zongyang. Alas, this decadent playboy was accustomed to idleness and had no intention of pursuing further artistic refinement. This caused excellent material to be gradually abandoned and obscured, like a beautiful jade buried in barren soil. Is this not a great pity? Shenglin's aptitude is relatively inferior, and he seems to lack the talent to learn from Yang. Occasionally, there are successes, but they are not entirely satisfactory. Yang Shengchun is in his prime and has the greatest hope, but he needs a famous teacher to guide him in order to become a great talent. Sun Yukun has excellent material and a proper teacher. He is the only one who surpasses others in learning the Yang school with his spirit and skill. However, his will is not firm, and he is deeply addicted to bad habits that he does not abstain from. If he continues to drift along and does not seek to improve, then his future achievement will, at best, only amount to becoming a Sun Yukun of today.

Moreover, among the aforementioned people, except for Sun Yukun, most are younger successors who saw Yang in his old age (such as his eyes being afraid of the light and often closing, coughing on stage, and all movements on stage becoming slower). They have never witnessed Xiaolou's bravery and skill in his prime. Therefore, most of today's Yang learners commit the two faults of "decay" and "weakness," and they imitate all of Yang's shortcomings, fearing that they will not be similar enough. This is a major mistake for Yang learners, just like Shanghai amateur opera singers learning from Zhou Xinfang, who must first make their voices hoarse before flaunting themselves as the Qi school. Both are undesirable strategies to imitate.

Xiaolou's skills are admired throughout the country. When he was approaching sixty years old, people were worried that his art would not be passed on. At that time, the wise Mr. Ye Yuhu (Gongchuo) even made the contribution of "selecting talents and teaching them so that the unique art can be passed down," which shows how highly Xiaolou's art was valued in the world. I have a copy of Mr. Ye's original letter, and I am publishing it here as a decision, as it is also excellent historical material for the pear garden.

"Mr. Xiaolou, although I often saw you in Beiping, I never had the chance to talk in depth. I know nothing about opera, but I am very interested in it because I love literature and art. I believe that it is necessary to preserve the truth and characteristics of Chinese opera today in order to discuss improvement. If the truth is lost first, how can we know the gains and losses? In recent years, most opera performers have lost their original style in order to keep up with the times, and the older generation is gradually dying out, with few successors. This is especially a misfortune for this art. Your art surpasses your peers, and you have no rivals today. Even in Shanghai, which follows the trend, there are still people who truly appreciate you, which shows that fame comes after substance and that there is still justice in the world. However, what I want to tell you most urgently is that you should realize that you are a unique village in the Chinese opera world. For the sake of the Chinese opera world, you should be responsible for passing on your unique art to future generations. Now that you are over fifty years old and your physical strength is gradually declining, I wonder if there is anyone among your students who is capable of succeeding you? I believe that you should pay special attention to selecting those with good qualities and teachability, and do your best to mold them so that they can see the essence of the art, so that the unique art will not be lost and your great name will last forever, which is far better than leaving wealth to your descendants. What I saw in my illness is presented frankly and directly, I hope you will understand. Ye Gongchuo."

### Vivien Leigh Serves Her Country Loyally

— New Square

British actress Vivien Leigh, who won the Academy Award for her role in "Gone with the Wind" last year, has gained worldwide fame. Recently, after completing her new film "Waterloo Bridge," Vivien Leigh and her new husband Laurence Olivier went to Broadway in New York to perform Shakespeare's famous play "Romeo and Juliet."

The news came that the performance industry was suspended from June 8th onwards. The two have been summoned by the British government and have decided to return home as soon as possible to join the wartime service department. Therefore, they have to temporarily bid farewell to all circles in Hollywood.

Vivien Leigh and others are returning to their country to serve completely voluntarily. It is said that Vivien had written to the national intelligence department beforehand, requesting to take on any work. Her patriotic spirit is truly admirable.

### Volcano Near

— Little Tian

A certain lawyer, after work, came to chat with me, from abroad to home, from official business to travel. Then we went to the park together. I saw two girls, Shan Shan, coming towards us, nodding their heads frequently. I looked at them carefully and they seemed familiar, but I couldn't remember their names. Then we talked to each other. One was Rong Feifei from Changzhou, and the other was Wang Weimei from Hong Kong. They had just returned from Hong Kong, due to the aftermath of the European storm, they had no choice but to return. According to them, the Hong Kong guests are more extravagant than those in Shanghai, because wealthy people are concentrated here, so few merchants have the habit of haggling over every penny. Feifei has joined Lido and is in great demand. On her first night, she sat at seven tables and received 350 gold coins. Big shots from Hong Kong also came to support her. The younger sister joined Dahua Nightclub, and I heard that her life is not bad. Because she is short, she is not suitable for dancing with tall people, so she is slightly inferior to Feifei.

The park tour was over, and we planned to find a place to dance. The tea dance was about to end, and the night dance was still early, so we went to a small dance hall on Fuxu Road. Although there was no music stage, there was air conditioning. There were more dancers than customers. Looking at them, there were few beauties. Just as we were about to leave, a woman lifted the curtain and entered. She looked a bit like Cheng Yanqiu more than ten years ago. My friend was a fan of Cheng opera, so we sat down again and urged me to try dancing. Although I didn't have the lightness of a flying swallow, my advances and retreats were still measured. I urged my friend to say that it was okay to bring out a city ticket, but my friend didn't listen. He went upstairs and called her to sit at the table, only three yuan per hour. It was a small expense. Looking at her carefully upstairs, she was indeed beautiful. I asked her name and she said it was Zhang Yongna, 17 years old, currently a freshman in a certain high school. My friend took out paper and asked her to write. Surprisingly, she could write in both Chinese and English. I then asked my friend, and my friend told the truth. She didn't believe it and said, "Those who play here are all common people. Lawyers must be literate. You try to write an English article, then I will believe it." My friend was a French student and was almost embarrassed. At that time, the woman was slightly arrogant, so my friend bought a city ticket and took her out. When we got into the car, I spied on the woman, and her arrogance had disappeared. When we arrived at the Metropolis, seeing the waiter's diligence and the dancers' frequent greetings, she also smiled humbly. This woman is indeed smart, and she will definitely be popular in the future. She is still a beautiful jade in a box.

### Bai Yang Will Return to Shanghai

— Star

The Golden Star Company, which is eagerly hoping to bring a different color to today's film industry, must start filming its maiden work on the 16th no matter what. The Golden Star authorities have internally decided on one of the three current popular stars to play the female lead, but a final decision has not yet been made, but it should be decided ten days ago.

Bai Yang sent a reply to Golden Star yesterday, saying that she will come to Shanghai, but she still has unfinished work in Chongqing, so she can only implement it after the autumn cools down. Gao Zhanfei also sent a letter, with opinions similar to Bai Yang, but said that it depends on the environment. His meaning seems to be that if the military celebration side fully agrees, then there will be no problem in returning to Shanghai.

### "Marriage" at Gong Hua

— Bao

"Marriage" is a three-act satirical comedy by the great Russian writer Gogol, which took ten years to write. It was previously performed by the Shanghai Drama Society and the Shanghai Art Society one after another, and both were well received. The Gong Hua Drama Troupe, which is the drama group of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Staff Club, is no stranger to the amateur drama world. It has performed more than a dozen plays such as "The Death of a Famous Actor," "The True Story of Ah Q," and "Collecting Fishing Taxes." It is an excellent drama troupe with a pure purpose. Because it is buried in hard work and unwilling to publicize, it has little contact with the outside world.

Recently, Gong Hua performed two plays at the same time. One was "A Woman and a Dog," which was unanimously recognized as a difficult play, and the other was the world-famous play "Marriage." Both plays were directed by Zheng Tong, and the actors included Jiang Hong, Li Cong, Li Zhi, Ma Qu, Zhuang Hua, Xu Lin, Yi Wei, Zhao Qin, Zhong Qi, etc. Although most of them are newcomers to the drama stage, their acting skills are quite exquisite, and their performance attitude is especially serious and meticulous. Moreover, the director's technique is light and clear, and the handling of the comedy scenes is lively and beautiful. Therefore, the performance was very successful, and the audience praised it unanimously.

Hawthorne's Detective Work

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 3: Opposing Information

Qin Mozhai walked to Wang Liland's corpse and took a careful look, shaking his head and saying to himself, "Alas! What a pity! Such a beauty, as if made of jade, would end up like this! Alas, the murderer is too cruel!" He turned his head again. "Hey, Mr. Hawthorne, Detective Ni, you have to work hard. This person must not be allowed to escape."

I thought to myself that although Qin Mozhai still maintained his talkative temper, he also showed that this dead dance queen did have some fascinating magic in her lifetime.

Hawthorne sarcastically said coldly, "You are this Miss Wang's confidant, it's just a little late!"

The police officer thought for a while, and then defended himself, "No, I am doing it for you two. This is a famous socialite who has been murdered. The newspaper will definitely have a lengthy report. Since you two are involved in this case, if you can't catch the murderer, it will not only be disappointing, but also a 'burden of fame'!"

Hawthorne bowed slightly. "Thank you for your advice and encouragement." He lit a cigarette and sat down slowly.

Ni Jinshou also felt Hawthorne's impatience, so he said with a serious face, "Chief Qin, if you want to express your opinions, you have to find a suitable time. Don't delay official business."

Qin Mozhai closed his lips tightly, shrank his neck, and then raised his hand to beckon to the four porters standing at the door.

After the four sturdy men came in, they first placed the stretcher on the carpet, and two of them began to move Wang Liland's body. The body was already a little stiff, and it was not very straight when it was placed on the stretcher, especially her head was hanging upside down. Hawthorne stood up again and gave the dead woman one last look. I had a strange feeling, how could there be no jewelry on such a wasteful and decadent woman. This feeling was expressed by Ni Jinshou.
