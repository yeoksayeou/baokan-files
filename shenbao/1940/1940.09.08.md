### If Japanese Troops Land in Vietnam, Chinese Troops Will Resolutely Resist. Important Railway Bridges on the Vietnamese Border Have Been Destroyed. Rumor Has It That a Battalion of Japanese Troops Entered Vietnam from Lang Son and Then Immediately Withdrew.

Chongqing: While the Chinese side's countermeasures regarding Vietnam's permission for Japanese troops to pass through remain difficult to ascertain, the general public, in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' declaration on August 18, believes that if Japanese troops were to land in Vietnam, the Chinese troops concentrated on the border would occupy key military points in the northern Vietnamese mountains to resist the Japanese attempt to attack Kunming northwards along the railway from Hanoi. According to the opinions of military experts, important railway bridges in the mountains have been destroyed, and Chinese troops can effectively resist along the border. (July 7th, Reuters dispatch)

Hanoi: A French government communique recently stated that Japanese troops entered Dong Dang (transliteration) on the Vietnamese border yesterday morning but withdrew at 6 PM yesterday without engaging in combat. Lieutenant General Nishihara, the leader of the Japanese delegation, visited Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux this morning and expressed deep regret over the incident. (July 7th, United Press dispatch)

Hanoi: Yesterday morning, approximately one battalion of Japanese troops, led by an officer, crossed the border near Dong Dang (transliteration) in the Lang Son military district without orders from their superiors and entered Vietnamese territory. Fortunately, French military officers maintained a firm and calm attitude, preventing the situation from escalating and resolving it quickly. By the afternoon, all Japanese troops had withdrawn from the Vietnamese border. General Nishihara, the chief representative of the Japanese inspection team, expressed his deep apologies to Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux this morning. (July 7th, Havas dispatch)

Chongqing: Authoritative sources today report that the Chinese National Government has decided to immediately dispatch troops into Vietnam as soon as the Japanese invade any part of Vietnam. However, when the territorial sovereignty of Vietnam has not been violated by the Japanese, Chinese troops will still respect the territorial sovereignty of Vietnam. The Chinese troops will only take this action when the Japanese implement aggression. According to the Ta Kung Pao, 200,000 Chinese troops are prepared to enter Vietnam when the Japanese invade French territory. According to a report from the Central News Agency, to ensure the adaptation of transportation in Vietnam, wireless broadcasting between Kunming and Hekou was opened yesterday. Well-informed sources say that, regarding the Japanese demands, although they have learned of reports confirming that the French authorities have adopted a compromising attitude, discussions between Tokyo and Vichy have not entered the final stage. Regarding the issue of Japanese troops passing through Vietnam, the topics discussed include: first, the number of Japanese troops or naval marines to be allowed to pass through; second, the route that Japan should take; and third, the location where the Japanese are allowed to land. It is said that the road through the mountains is limited to the railway section from Haiphong to Lao Cai, and the branch line between Hanoi and Lang Son. It is also said that there are three locations where the Japanese are allowed to land in Vietnam. (July 7th, United Press dispatch)

London: Although there is a rumor from Chongqing that the Vietnamese authorities have allowed 12,000 Japanese soldiers to land at three locations, a Reuters diplomatic correspondent says that as of now, London has not received news of Japanese troops landing in Vietnam. (July 7th, Reuters dispatch)

Hanoi: It is rumored that Chinese troops entered Vietnamese territory on the 5th of this month and had a fierce conflict with French border defense forces, eventually being repelled. One person on the French side died and ten were injured. Border defenses have been strengthened since then. (July 7th, Havas dispatch)

Manila: Chinese and foreign figures here are greatly shocked to hear that the Vietnamese authorities have agreed to Japan's request to pass through with troops. They initially believed that the Vietnamese authorities would maintain a strong position and, if they remained unchanged, Japan would eventually withdraw its request and be unwilling to launch an attack on Vietnam at this time. Moreover, with Britain and the United States successively negotiating with Japan to maintain the status quo in the Far East, the Vietnamese authorities' tactics could be strengthened accordingly. Now, the sudden change of plan must be due to German pressure on the Vichy government to force concessions. (July 7th, Reuters dispatch)

Vichy: Regarding the Vietnam issue, the Vietnamese authorities and Japanese representatives are still holding continuous meetings in Hanoi, while the French and Japanese governments are also conducting negotiations in a sincere environment. U.S. Secretary of State Hull has issued a statement to maintain the status quo in Vietnam. According to sources in Tokyo, French-Japanese negotiations, whether in the past or at present, have not involved the status quo in Vietnam. This has been confirmed here. (July 7th, Havas dispatch)

Hong Kong: According to sources from the Vietnamese responsible parties, France and Japan have agreed on a basic agreement allowing Japanese troops to pass through the Tokyo region only. The Japanese request to use the convenience of airfields has been rejected by the French authorities. Japanese troops are only allowed to land in Haiphong and travel by train through French territory, but may not leave the railway area. (July 7th, Reuters dispatch)

Tokyo: Authoritative neutral sources recently stated that Japan and Vietnam have reached an agreement allowing Japan to pass troops through, use air force bases, and station troops on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Although private sources arriving here say that Vietnam has rejected Japan's request for air force bases, they point out that the Japanese have freely used the Hanoi airport for military and commercial purposes since the middle of last month. Details regarding the conditions for transporting troops are not yet known, as negotiations regarding Japan's various requests are still ongoing in Hanoi. However, sources with difficulty accessing information say that France has allowed Japan to transport troops within certain specific areas of Vietnam and along the railway. (July 7th, United Press dispatch)

Hong Kong: Authoritative sources say that according to British officials, although an agreement has been reached allowing Japan to transport troops through Vietnam, Japanese troops have not yet landed in Vietnam, and are not expected to land within the next few days. Negotiations are still ongoing in Hanoi. The French agreement only allows Japanese troops to pass through the Tokyo region, but the detailed methods of transporting troops are still being discussed in Hanoi. It is also said that the French, in allowing Japanese troops to pass through, stipulated that Japanese troops can only use the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to reach Chinese territory and cannot leave the railway area. It is rumored that the Japanese request to build official air force bases in Vietnam has been rejected by the French. However, authoritative sources strongly say that negotiations are continuing on this point and other issues. According to travelers arriving here from Hanoi, they have not seen any signs of Japanese troops landing. Although there are 20 Japanese people wearing military uniforms at the Hanoi airport, this is not unusual. Moreover, authoritative Chinese sources in Vietnam believe that when the Japanese troops land, they will order some of their troops to disguise themselves as Chinese troops and launch disturbances on the Guangxi-Vietnam border, thereby claiming that they are stationing troops in Vietnam to eliminate so-called "Chinese terrorism".

The Japanese suffered extremely heavy losses. (July 7th dispatch)

### Liu Yiren Passes Away in Chengdu

Chengdu: Liu Yiren, the Chief of Staff of the Chengdu Provisional Headquarters, contracted dysentery a month ago. Medical treatment was ineffective, and he passed away on the morning of the 6th. Liu graduated from the fourth class of the Army University. When the staff group entered Sichuan, he served as the Chief of the First Division, and later as the Chief of the First Bureau of the Chongqing Provisional Headquarters. He was then transferred to his current position, advising on military affairs with extreme diligence. His sudden death is mourned by all who hear of it. (June 6th dispatch)

Yulin: Chinese troops in eastern Suiyuan have been extremely active recently. A few days ago, they launched a fierce attack on Xinghe County Town, an important Japanese stronghold, catching the Japanese by surprise. They charged into the city in one go, killing and slashing horizontally and vertically, and almost completely annihilated the Japanese. They seized over 320 rifles and countless other military supplies. (July 7th dispatch)

### Japanese Troops in Yangquan Fail in Their Western Offensive

Xingji: Japanese troops in Yangquan on the Zhengtai Railway launched a fierce offensive to the west on the morning of the 29th under the cover of aircraft. They were blocked and attacked by the Chinese troops in the Sangzhang Potou area. After a day of fierce fighting, the Japanese failed to succeed. Then, a certain unit of the Chinese troops detoured to attack the rear of the Japanese, cutting them into several sections and killing over a hundred Japanese troops. (July 7th dispatch)

Luoyang: On the evenings of the 27th and 29th, Chinese troops in southwestern Shanxi launched attacks on Japanese strongholds in the Wenxi and Xiaxian areas, including the mountain pass, Xiaowang Village, Chen Village, Chuanjia Slope, and Wende Village. The fighting was extremely fierce. The Chinese troops, with the momentum of a bamboo split, breached many Japanese positions and annihilated over 300 Japanese troops, seizing a large number of weapons and ammunition. (July 7th dispatch)

Luoyang: A unit of Chinese troops in southeastern Shanxi launched an attack on the Japanese near Lanzhen Town south of Jincheng on the 29th. After three hours of fierce fighting, they killed many Japanese troops and captured many Japanese soldiers from the Nishida Regiment, including Tanaka Katsumi, seizing a large number of weapons and ammunition. (July 7th dispatch)

### Jiang Zuobin Publishes Inspection Thoughts

Chongqing: Jiang Zuobin, the Director of the Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou Group of the Executive Yuan's Political Inspection Group, along with members Duanmu Kai and Wang Nanran, departed on July 16 to inspect the administration of the three provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. They have now completed their task and returned to Chongqing on the morning of the 6th. They will pay their respects to President Jiang within a few days and report on the inspection. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Director Jiang to inquire about his thoughts on the inspection. Jiang smiled and told the reporter that what he saw during this inspection—the vigorous economic construction and the rapid advancement of civilian production in the Great Rear—was enough to excite people. In terms of local administration, the three provinces are all vigorously implementing the new county system promulgated by the central government and actively promoting education. However, because the Yunnan Province's Baojia system was implemented later, the implementation of the new county system is expected to be slightly slower, but its swiftness in issuing orders is a unique advantage. The Guizhou Province's anti-smoking administration has achieved the most outstanding results and can be called a model. The economic capabilities and living conditions of the people are more robust and better than in previous years. All of these provinces have had a bumper harvest this year, and their future economic development is limitless. (June 6th dispatch)

Editorial

### Thoughts on the European Situation

To say that humans are political animals is an achievement of gradual human evolution; to say that humans are warlike animals is a nature inherited from the primitive. Today's world is an exposure of human nature, leading to mutual slaughter.

Taking Europe as an example, since the opening of the war last autumn, the combat methods of both sides have evolved from the initial submarine and mine warfare of localized slaughter, through airborne and tank warfare, to the current collective slaughter of "London Blitz" and "Bombing of Berlin". Following this deduction, if the victory or defeat cannot be decided early, it is not guaranteed that gas warfare or germ warfare, which people talk about with dread, may also be adopted! In this modern era of academic prosperity and developed human intelligence, such cruel phenomena occur, which cannot but make people feel that culture has regressed by thousands of years!

Regarding the results of this European war, let us set aside the gains and losses of the first four countries to start the war, namely Britain, France, Germany, and Poland; and the naked facts before our eyes are that at least many small countries have been destroyed or dismembered. It is a pity that these small countries themselves have weaknesses, but the foundation of their establishment is peaceful and neutral. People do not offend them, and they will never offend others; this time, in the sound of the expansion of the war, they have become associated victims for the sake of the military or political reasons of several major powers: counting on fingers, in the past year, there have been no less than seven or eight countries occupied or annexed by major powers; and the country that recently encountered such a similar misfortune is the so-called "neutral country" in southeastern Europe with an area of more than 290,000 square kilometers and a population of 20 million—Romania. This is the first victim in the Balkans in this European war. Its territory was not taken by belligerent countries by force, but was divided into two-thirds by three other neutral countries. In other words: the Soviet Union, relying on its own power, demanded Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina; Bulgaria, with the support of Britain and the Soviet Union, requested Southern Dobruja; and finally, Hungary, due to the support of Italy and Germany, obtained Northern Transylvania. This partition movement is nominally to reclaim old land, but in fact it is nothing more than taking advantage of the fire to loot. Of course, Romania, with its complex ethnic composition and factional infighting, usually does not know how to eliminate internal contradictions and strengthen military preparations. Since the European war, it has vacillated between the two major powers and has never had an independent and autonomous response policy: it was expected that it would attract the coveting of its neighbors, and we now have no time to criticize its right and wrong. What we urgently want to study and consider very important, however, is whether this area can be peaceful after this country is partitioned? Regarding this point, I am afraid it is the opposite, that is, the Balkans cannot avoid being more troubled from now on.

Originally, after the outbreak of the war last year, many people believed that the powder keg that would explode first due to its impact would be the Balkan Peninsula; who knew that the matter was not so, but Northern Europe came first, followed by Western Europe, then Africa, and the intricate and complex Southeastern Europe unexpectedly has not suffered from war. But what about the future? The King of Romania has abdicated, the political power has fallen into the hands of the Iron Guard, and from then on, its foreign policy will abandon Britain and lean towards the Axis powers; can all this eliminate the contradictions of the great powers in Southeastern Europe? Observing with cold eyes from the side, one would rather draw the opposite conclusion: that is, if the war between Britain and Germany is prolonged, then, whether from a military and political point of view, or simply based on physics, the scope of the war will inevitably continue to expand in the future. Looking at the entire map of Europe, I am afraid that only this corner of Southeastern Europe is the possible development area of war.

Here, we cannot help but examine the significance of the current stage of the war between Britain and Germany: (1) In terms of Britain, at the beginning of the German-Polish war last autumn, Britain's participation in the war contained the meaning of "upholding justice and raising an army for righteousness," but as it stands, since Britain initially opposed Germany's demand for Danzig and the Polish Corridor, why does it now support Bulgaria's request to reclaim old land from Romania? And since it is said to be against aggression, why doesn't Britain declare war on the Soviet Union and Japan for the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland and Poland, and Japan's aggression against China? (2) In terms of Germany, before and after the outbreak of the war last year, Germany flaunted the principle of nationalism on the one hand, and self-defense and resistance to the threat of democratic countries on the other. But at this point, the principle of nationalism has long disappeared, and as for the so-called threat, with today's military strength of Germany and the current situation in continental Europe, Germany is as stable as Mount Tai, people are afraid of him, and no one dares to invade him! Therefore, it is said that the significance of the war between Britain and Germany in the past year has undergone great changes: thoroughly speaking, the current war between Britain and Germany fully shows that it is a war for each other to compete for European hegemony! In our opinion, Europe is small, but can it really not accommodate two or three major powers to coexist? Moreover, one is an island naval power, and the other is a continental land power, and there is plenty of room for each other to give way, complement each other, coexist and prosper together. In Hitler's book "Mein Kampf," Britain was not listed as an enemy country, and he seemed to have blamed William II for not fighting Britain in the last European war.

Of course, making such a suggestion today, when the war between Britain and Germany is difficult to resolve, is tantamount to dreaming, but the reason why we cannot help but still make it is precisely because we deeply feel from the standpoint of this time and place that the current European war is not as clear as the Far Eastern war in terms of consciousness; in other words, the Far Eastern war must be fought, as for the war between Britain and Germany, it could have been avoided. The result of the European war, in addition to both sides suffering, is that many small countries are sacrificed in vain. Moreover, according to historical experience, after each major war, the roots of the next major war are often laid in advance during the peace talks; the past events of the Congress of Vienna after Napoleon's defeat, and the evils of the Paris Peace Conference after the last European war, are lessons from the past. Britain and Germany are both excellent nations. Why don't we see signs of timely awakening? Is it really the warlike nature of mankind that dominates their reason?

### Containing Far Eastern Aggression: US and Soviet Union Are Conducting Talks; British-American Cooperation to Deal with Japanese Threat; Protecting Important Interests in the Far East

New York: A Washington correspondent for the New York Post stated that, in order to contain Japan's tide of aggression in the Far East, the United States has launched important discussions with the Soviet Union. According to reliable sources in the State Department, the primary purpose of these talks is to prevent Japan from attacking the Dutch East Indies. US-Soviet discussions may lead to a formal or informal alliance between the US and the Soviet Union, but at present, the United States is handling the matter cautiously and has not put forward concrete proposals. However, the fact that the US and the Soviet Union are currently holding talks is a warning to Japan. The repeated meetings between Under Secretary of State Welles and Soviet Ambassador to the United States Oumansky are discussing this matter. (July 7th, Reuters dispatch)

Washington: Well-informed sources say that the U.S. government seems to have adopted extensive actions to counter Japan's expansionist forces in the Far East. It is also said that Soviet Ambassador to the United States Oumansky has held repeated negotiations with U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles and will continue after Welles returns from his leave. Well-informed sources believe that the United States is helping Britain persuade the Soviet Union to dissolve its non-aggression pact with Germany. (July 7th, United Press dispatch)

Washington: Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that, in addition to issuing a statement on Vietnam last Wednesday, the United States will protest to Japan regarding maintaining the status quo in Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies. Hull avoided directly answering questions about the protest, but he said that he would not be surprised if "some peaceful governments" took the same action. He said that he believed France has not yet agreed to "some proposals" that could interfere with the status quo in Vietnam. (July 7th, United Press dispatch)

Tokyo: According to the Kokumin Shimbun, which often publishes opinions from the military, Britain and the United States are gradually becoming more hardened in their attitude towards Japan. This can be evidenced by the joint note sent by Britain and the United States to the Japanese government, because the British and American governments are eager to maintain the status quo in Vietnam and are greatly concerned about its changes. The newspaper predicts that the "erroneous policy of intervention" jointly carried out by Britain and the United States in the Far East may make the situation in the Southwest Pacific increasingly tense. It then said that Japan cannot suddenly ignore the strengthening of the common front by Britain and the United States in the Pacific region, so it must pay attention to the development of the overall situation and prepare to respond to any events. The Asahi Shimbun said that Japan must be determined to overcome all obstacles placed by British-American cooperation on the road to establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, because this sphere is necessary for Japan's national survival. Former Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Rear Admiral Yarnell, etc., recently spoke out, advocating that the British and American navies should jointly defeat Japan and Germany, and U.S. Secretary of State Hull's statement on the Vietnam issue on September 4, and the British Foreign Secretary Halifax's similar statement in the House of Commons the next day, proves the cooperation between Britain and the United States on Far Eastern affairs. After Britain and the United States cooperated in the Atlantic, the United States will actively develop its Far Eastern policy, and Britain's promise not to scuttle its fleet will also allow the United States to not have to worry about Atlantic affairs. (July 7th, Reuters dispatch)

Moscow: Pravda said that the British-American base agreement has included or will include the Far East. The Trade Union Trud said that the Far East is undoubtedly included. (July 7th, Reuters dispatch)

### Singapore Naval Base: Britain Decides to Allow the US to Use It

Washington: People here believe that extremely complete cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East, to protect their extremely important interests threatened by the Japanese government, now exists, but concrete developments must await a more suitable American political atmosphere. The recent British-American agreement is a heavy dose that American isolationists must swallow. The authorities feel that it is best to give it time to digest slowly. Afterwards, Britain-American and America-Australia will again discuss the Far Eastern issue. It is rumored that the issue of the British and American fleets using the Singapore naval port in the event of an emergency, according to the battlefield situation, will also be raised for discussion. Naval officials here are convinced that if the United States needs the Singapore base, it will be available for use by the U.S. fleet. However, if Britain made this suggestion at this time, it would cause misunderstandings, pointing out that Britain is using this to entice the United States to pull chestnuts from the fire for Britain. Yesterday, Secretary of State Hull and Ambassador Lothian and Australian envoy Casey reviewed the entire situation and decided that a gradualist policy was the most appropriate. Hull told people that no concrete methods have been established, nor have any decisions been made. (July 7th, Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing: The Central Daily News stated that the British-American agreement is clear proof of close cooperation between Britain and the United States. However, whether British-American cooperation is limited to the Western Ocean or will expand to the Pacific is still an important question today. Although Britain and the United States are currently focused on the European situation, they must also take closer cooperation in the Far East to protect Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines. (July 7th, Reuters dispatch)

### US and Australia, Canada, New Zealand Sign Friendship Treaty; Secretary of State Hull Answers Questions: US and Australia May Have Joint Defense

New York: A friendship treaty between the United States and Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, aimed at promoting peace, was signed today in Secretary of State Hull's office. The treaty stipulates that if any disputes cannot be resolved by ordinary diplomatic methods, a committee should be organized to investigate and prepare a report. After the United States continues the U.S.-Canada joint defense agreement, U.S. Secretary of State Hull was asked whether the U.S. would sign a similar treaty with Australia. Hull replied that he had not heard of this matter at this time, but he could not rule out the possibility in the future. (July 7th, Reuters dispatch)

### Two Central American Countries Cooperate with the US to Carry Out Defense Plans

Washington: President Roosevelt told reporters that the two Central American republics of Costa Rica and Ecuador are fully cooperating with the United States to carry out the Americas' defense plan. The United States is currently not holding negotiations with any country to seek other sea and air bases. After outside parties blamed the president for not disclosing the truth at the press conference before announcing the base lease rights and destroyer exchange, the president took the opportunity to answer questions in a conversation with reporters, saying that when all the official documents are released in the future, people will know that the accusations were made prematurely. He believed that the State Department has decided to release these official documents in about ten years. The President also said that this transaction did not involve any other equipment besides the original gun positions on the destroyers. The President also said that the discussions of the U.S.-Canada Joint Defense Board are currently proceeding satisfactorily. When the President spoke, news from those in close contact with the White House reported that the United States believed that Cocos Island was not suitable as a U.S. sea and air base, and also believed that the French-owned Clipperton Island was not suitable. (July 7th, Reuters dispatch)

New York: According to news from Ottawa today, the next meeting of the U.S.-Canada Joint Defense Board will discuss the issue of building a military highway from the United States, through Canada, to Alaska (July 7th, Haitong News Agency dispatch)

### Three U.S. Warships Arrive in Canada; Britain Prepares to Receive Them

An Eastern Canadian Military Port: The first batch of 50 U.S. destroyers being transferred, a total of three ships, arrived here yesterday from Boston. Informed sources here say that the three ships will be put into service immediately, and it is widely believed that the other ships will arrive this week. (United Press dispatch, 7th)

A Certain Port in Eastern Canada: A British ship arrived here today, carrying British sailors to receive the U.S. destroyers. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

New York: Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie yesterday vehemently criticized President Roosevelt for rashly exchanging 50 destroyers for naval bases in the British Western Hemisphere without the consent of Congress. Willkie said, "The President's action without the consent of Congress is an abuse of his power, and it violates the spirit of our legal system. We do not know what he will exchange in the future. Although I strongly support aid to Britain, this action is very inappropriate." He concluded, "If President Roosevelt is re-elected next year, he may exchange the Philippine Islands without the consent of Congress and inform us afterwards." (International News Service dispatch, 7th)

### U.S. Congress Passes "Total Defense" Bill, Allocates Over Five Billion Dollars to Build Aircraft and a Two-Ocean Navy

Washington: Yesterday, the U.S. Congress completely passed the $5,251,486,392 "Total Defense" bill. The bill allocates funds to build 18,421 aircraft, a two-ocean navy, and a mechanized army of 1.2 million men. The bill brings this year's total national defense expenditure and construction contract funds to $10,125,000,000, not including the $4,125,000,000 in the naval expansion bill. (United Press dispatch, 7th)

Washington: The Senate has just completed appropriating $5,251,000,000 to fund the Congressional action to equip a two million-man army and create a two-ocean navy. This bill has been submitted to the White House for President Roosevelt's signature. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

Washington: The House Naval Affairs Committee recommended legislation to allow the U.S. Navy to build the world's largest dry dock in New York Harbor, estimated to cost $10 million. The committee also recommended building another battleship-capable dry dock at the entrance to the Panama Canal from the Atlantic Ocean. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

### Complete Ban on Scrap Iron Exports; U.S. Defense Advisory Committee to Advise Roosevelt

New York: The New York Times Washington dispatch reports that the National Defense Advisory Commission will soon advise President Roosevelt to completely ban the export of scrap iron. The committee has decided that all scrap iron is needed for domestic military equipment. Once this ban is implemented, Japan will be one of the main affected parties, as 91 percent of the scrap iron imported by Japan in 1939 came from the United States. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

### U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Amendment to Conscription Law

Washington: Yesterday, the House of Representatives, by a vote of 161 to 47, rejected the provision in the Burke-Wadsworth Conscription Act amendment that set the conscription age at 21 to 30 years old. It also rejected the amendment's proposal to extend the conscription age to 55 years old. The provision setting the conscription age at 21 to 31 years old was a Senate amendment, while the House is now advocating for 21 to 45 years old. The House also rejected the amendment's opposition to conscripted soldiers serving in the Philippines. (United Press dispatch, 7th)

### Konoe Has Decided on Diplomatic Policy; Tokyo Groups Resolve to Oppose "Flattering Diplomacy"

Tokyo: This morning's meeting between Colonel Hisamoto, a member of the New Structure Preparatory Committee, and Prime Minister Konoe has attracted general attention. Hisamoto told people afterwards that he was seeking the Prime Minister's clarification of diplomatic policy because it must be refreshed before establishing the new structure. Hisamoto also expressed his impression that Prime Minister Konoe has already decided on his diplomatic policy, which was apparently reaffirmed at yesterday's core cabinet meeting. However, it is currently unknown when the new diplomatic policy will take concrete form. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

Tokyo: Three hundred representatives from various groups here recently resolved to condemn the "flattering diplomacy" towards Germany and Britain, stating that this kind of diplomacy violates Japan's independent diplomatic policy. They also resolved to immediately hold demonstrations to oppose pro-German and pro-British diplomacy. This is the first time that the Japanese people have condemned Japanese diplomats for being pro-German. (United Press dispatch, 7th)

### German Air Force Adopts New Tactics; London Bombed Seven Times in One Day; Bombs Fall on Suburbs, Many Civilian Casualties; Air Combat Results in Numerous German Aircraft Shot Down

London: From last night until 1:01 AM this morning (9:01 AM Shanghai summer time), German bombers carried out seven brutal bombings in the London area. Reliable sources say that a total of 46 German aircraft were shot down. Yesterday during the day, the Air Ministry announced that German aircraft attempted to break through the London defense line a total of three times, with a total of 650 German aircraft participating in these attempts. The first time was 300 aircraft, the second attempt involved 200 aircraft that broke through over the coast of Kent, and the third attempt was made at dusk with 100 aircraft. During last night's air raids, many bombs fell on the outskirts of London, killing many civilians. Soldiers were stationed on alert around the area, and ambulances were lined up waiting to load the victims. During the last air raid, multiple large fires broke out and spread widely, but most of the fires were quickly extinguished. It is reported that there were extremely high civilian casualties. Hundreds of incendiary bombs and high-explosive bombs fell on a factory and a stable. Several strangely sounding bombs and "Molotov bread basket" type bombs fell in the London area. German aircraft are now using new tactics, dropping flares three times during each bombing run and flying in concealed locations to avoid searchlights. Only when the target is illuminated by the third flare do they drop bombs. Yesterday morning, 100 German aircraft attacked the two airfields in the southeast, encountering terrible anti-aircraft fire. After the anti-aircraft guns fired, British fighters engaged in fierce air combat for about ten minutes before the German aircraft fled. (United Press dispatch, 7th)

London: The Air Ministry issued a communiqué this afternoon, stating that the scope of enemy air raids had narrowed this morning. Enemy aircraft attacked a certain airfield in Kent without effect, but a bomb landed nearby, causing some casualties. According to reports received so far, British fighters shot down one enemy bomber and one enemy fighter this morning. There were no British losses. It is now known that another enemy aircraft was shot down yesterday, so the total number of losses is 46. This afternoon, British fighter squadrons intercepted enemy aircraft over the Thames Estuary and shot down an enemy aircraft that infiltrated to drop bombs. The first alarm was issued in London at 3:55 PM this afternoon, but detailed reports of the air raid were not available until 5:00 PM. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

London: Yesterday, German aircraft attempted to break through London's defenses, suffering heavy losses and failing. In the morning, Spitfire and Hurricane British fighters shot down an enemy aircraft every two minutes. By 10:30 PM last night, 45 German aircraft had been destroyed, and British fighters had only lost 19, with the pilots of ten of them unharmed. Residents of a certain town on the southeast coast gathered in the streets last night to watch the great air battle. British fighter machine guns roared and dove into the formations of German bombers, scattering them. The German aircraft fled out to sea, and at least two crashed into the sea. Two German crew members parachuted out, and a tugboat with a naval surgeon on board went out to sea to rescue them.

At 7:55 PM last night, another air raid alarm was issued in London because German aircraft were approaching the Thames Estuary. British fighters attacked swiftly, and five German aircraft were shot down within ten seconds. The attacking German bombers and fighters numbered several hundred. Witnesses said that there was continuous fierce fighting over a large area of the Thames Estuary, the scale of which had never been seen in the area. According to the Air Ministry Intelligence Office, in one hour of air combat in southeastern England, British fighters shot down more than 20 German bombers and fighters. A squadron of Spitfire British fighters has repeatedly performed outstanding feats recently, and shot down eight Messerschmitt German fighters again this morning, with another two possibly shot down. Yesterday morning, about 300 Junkers bombers, protected by a large number of fighters, attacked in groups of 20 to 30 aircraft, targeting airfields. Most of the air combat took place in Kent and Essex, but some German aircraft were intercepted outside Beachy Head. After the fourth alarm in London was lifted at 10:14 PM last night, a fifth alarm was issued at 10:30 PM. According to witnesses watching the battle from the roof of the Reuters building on Fleet Street, German aircraft attacking the London area last night used a new technique, with one aircraft dropping a cluster of three flares. While the flares illuminated the target, the aircraft flew away to avoid the searchlights, then returned quickly to drop bombs. However, the anti-aircraft guns continued to fire fiercely. It is reported that high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs fell on several streets in the London area, destroying several houses and causing fires, with some casualties. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

### British Air Force Counterattacks; Fierce Bombing of French Coastal Ports; Explosions Shake the Opposite Coast; British Aircraft Break Through Berlin's Defenses and Drop Bombs

A certain town in southeastern England: People here witnessed yesterday that the intensity of the Royal Air Force's counterattacks against Germany is increasing daily, especially in the area of the English Channel. Royal Air Force aircraft continued to drop heavy bombs in the French Channel on Thursday night and yesterday morning, apparently intending to destroy the German airfields in the area so that German aircraft cannot attack Britain. The sound of bombing in France on Thursday night and yesterday morning was unprecedentedly loud. People in Boulogne and Dunkirk could see the flames when the bombs landed on the opposite shore, as well as the explosions of anti-aircraft shells. Here, the ground shook when the bombs exploded. German anti-aircraft batteries formed a dense "onion-shaped flame," but the bombs continued to fall incessantly throughout the night. In addition, British aircraft also bombed other "major targets" in Germany. Aviation experts here believe that British aircraft have passed the "testing" period and are now in a struggle for life and death to determine the fate of Europe. (United Press dispatch, 7th)

Berlin: The Royal Air Force made a violent attack on Berlin. The alarm was issued at 12:15 AM this morning and lifted at 3:00 AM. It is said that most of the British aircraft were driven back before reaching Berlin, but the authorities admit that several aircraft broke through the air defenses and dropped bombs, causing multiple fires. British aircraft came in waves, mostly flying from the Hamburg area. The German government claims that Royal Air Force aircraft were unable to fly low due to being blocked by barrage balloons, so they remained at high altitude. British aircraft also attacked the Ruhr area. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

### German Military Communiqué

Berlin: This afternoon, the German military report stated that yesterday German aircraft bombed important military targets in southern England, including the aircraft manufacturing plants in Rochester and Weybridge, the oil depot in Thameshaven, and the airfield in Cranleigh. Many enemy aircraft were shot down. The targets of last night's German air raids were mainly British naval ports and aircraft manufacturing plants. Liverpool, Manchester, Derby, and various ports on the south coast were heavily damaged. North of Aberdeen, a 6,000-ton merchant ship was sunk. German aircraft also dropped mines in various British ports. Last night, enemy aircraft attacked Berlin, dropping several bombs randomly in the center of the city, causing civilian casualties and damage to private property. Therefore, in retaliation, the German Air Force launched a large-scale bombing of London. The docks in East London caught fire, and the oil depot in Thameshaven also caught fire, with the light illuminating the distance. In total, 67 enemy aircraft were lost yesterday, of which 52 were shot down in air combat. German anti-aircraft guns shot down one enemy aircraft, and German destroyers destroyed one enemy aircraft at night. In addition, 13 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground. In total, from August 1st to August 31st, the German side destroyed 596,500 tons of enemy cargo, of which submarines destroyed 503,000 tons. The cargo destroyed by mines is not included. If the total amount of enemy cargo lost since the beginning of the war is calculated, the amount is astonishingly large, reaching 4,323,000 tons, of which submarines destroyed 2,768,000 tons.

### German Strategy Mysterious and Unpredictable; Rumors of Tunneling Under the Channel to Invade Britain; U.S. Experts Believe This is Impossible

Washington: Military experts here are quite interested in studying the rumor that Germany may dig a tunnel under the English Channel to transport troops to invade Britain. A telegram quoted German adviser Herr's words, saying that German workers are engaged in building military projects in the English Channel, which made people believe the rumors were true. However, U.S. military experts unanimously believe that this plan is impossible because (1) the project would take too long; (2) even if completed, it would be easily destroyed by bombs or even flooded; (3) it is impossible to build another secret exit, so if the German troops traveling in the tunnel are attacked before reaching British territory, they will not be able to find an exit to hide or escape. Therefore, U.S. experts believe that the rumors of German workers working on projects in the English Channel must be for projects such as building seaports, air force bases, or gun emplacements.

Moscow: The report in the Japanese newspaper Hochi Shimbun that Stalin met with German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Count von der Schulenburg at the end of August regarding the signing of a Soviet-German-Italian-Japanese pact and the cancellation of the Anti-Comintern Pact has been officially denied here. According to a statement issued by TASS, authorized by the authorities, the Hochi Shimbun's report is a complete fabrication from beginning to end, as Stalin has never met with Count von der Schulenburg in the past six or seven months. (TASS dispatch, 7th)

### Japanese Residents in Singapore Oppose Southern Expansion Policy; Believe Konoe's Plan Will Not Be Effective; Some Japanese Fishermen Migrate to Hainan Island

Singapore: Japanese residents in Singapore and the Malay Peninsula oppose Prime Minister Konoe's "southern expansion" program, believing that it will not have the "stabilizing" effect that the Japanese government claims. A prominent business spokesman for the Japanese community here said today that they hope to eliminate the Malay Chinese boycott of Japanese goods and maintain the status quo of peace in the area. The recent arrest of Japanese news reporter Kobayashi has caused unrest among the Japanese community here, but this has now been eliminated. The Japanese side stated that they, about 3,000 people, are law-abiding. Previously, when the police authorities interfered with the Japanese, it was mostly with Japanese people who were on "leisure holidays" in the islands or Japanese people who came here from other countries. In the past five or six years, there have been few instances of the authorities paying attention to Japanese residents on the island. The authorities occasionally do not allow Japanese people who have returned to their home country for short vacations to return to this country. Japanese people have a long history of residing in Malaya, but their organizations for sharing the benefits of mining and agriculture only began in 1920. The former Japanese Consul General in Singapore admitted that Japanese people were sometimes seen as suspicious characters. He said that this may be because the Japanese were unable to get along with the non-Japanese people in the area. Although Japan's commercial interests in Singapore are mainly in rubber, tin, coconuts, vegetable oil, and shipping, Japanese companies own two large iron mines on the Malay Peninsula, producing the best iron ore. Last year, 2 million tons of iron ore were shipped to Japan from there. Bauxite, used to make aluminum and aircraft, is also mined by the Japanese on the Malay Peninsula. The Japanese also own rubber plantations, but they still purchase the rubber and tin they need on the market. Although the Malay Peninsula is a favorable market for Japanese manufactured goods, it is not an important market, as the island only has a population of 5 million. Java, with a population of over 40 million, is more important than the Malay Peninsula. Singapore is a Japanese fishing center. Japanese fishing boats departing from here go as far north as Burma and as far south as Darwin, Northern Australia. When part of the fishermen's licenses were revoked by the Singapore authorities, most of the Japanese fishermen moved to Malaya to engage in iron ore mining, because the Chinese there were unwilling to work for the Japanese to produce raw materials for weapons. The remaining Japanese fishermen moved to Hainan Island, which was newly occupied by the Japanese army. The island has now been designated as a fishing territory to replace Singapore's position. The current value of the Japanese fishing industry in Singapore is 1 million Singapore dollars. (United Press dispatch, 7th)

Vichy: The cabinet held a meeting at 5:00 PM today, and all ministers immediately submitted their resignations to Chief of State Marshal Pétain. By 6:30 PM, Marshal Pétain had completed the reorganization of the new cabinet. The list is as follows:

The original Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Youth and Family have been abolished. Deputy Prime Minister Laval will now be responsible for coordinating matters among the ministers and presiding over intelligence affairs, with even greater power. Among the new cabinet members, Army Minister Huntziger served as Commander-in-Chief of the French forces in the Near East and conducted armistice negotiations with Germany and Italy.

(Havas dispatch, 6th)

Vichy: Although the incumbent Minister of National Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Army, and Air Force, General Weygand, was not reappointed in this cabinet reorganization, Marshal Pétain has decided to assign him to another important position, appointing him as the government's representative stationed in various parts of French Africa and granting him extremely broad powers to maintain the security of the various territories and strengthen their defenses. The government is determined to do everything possible to resist any conspiracy to alienate the country from its territories. This can be seen here. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

The difference between this decree and the decree issued by King Carol on December 5, 1939, is that it does not mention the King's power of amnesty, nor the power to conclude treaties and appoint cabinet ministers and deputy ministers. (July 7th Reuters dispatch)

Rome. Yesterday morning in Rome, members of the Iron Guard attempted to break into the residence of former Prime Minister Arghezi, exchanging fire with two guards outside the gate, killing them. No disturbances have occurred there since. Romania is currently without a government. The National Peasants' Party, led by Maniu, and the Liberal Party, led by Bratianu, have both agreed to cooperate with Antonescu, but only on the condition that Antonescu agrees to establish a constitutional and parliamentary government. (July 7th Reuters)

Rome. Dictator and Prime Minister General Antonescu yesterday ordered Iron Guard members to cease their riots. At the time, these pro-National Socialist party members were marching through the streets of the capital, destroying Jewish-owned stores. Iron Guards were deployed in large numbers throughout Rome, entering stores and forcing shopkeepers to hoist the Romanian national flag to celebrate the King's abdication and his son Michael's succession. At the same time, the new Prime Minister held meetings with various political leaders to form a new cabinet. Since the new King's ascension, after issuing a proclamation, the Prime Minister has obtained unlimited power. Radio Rome broadcasted that the Prime Minister had appointed General Niculescu as Minister of the Navy, and Mosu as Minister of Transportation and Director of Railways. According to the radio, the mayor of Rome, Dobrosescu, has been dismissed. At the same time, the radio officially announced that the Privy Council, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, has taken all steps to withdraw troops from Outer Transylvania. The new King Michael was sworn in at 9:30 AM yesterday, only four and a half hours after his father's abdication. The oath was read to Prime Minister Antonescu, Foreign Minister Manoilescu, Interior Minister Popescu, Justice Minister Gruia, and Propaganda Minister Cranea.

### Ministry of Personnel Establishes Provisional Measures for the Appointment of Civil Servants During Extraordinary Times; Agencies May Raise Statutory Appointment Qualifications If Special Needs Arise

Chongqing. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, there have been many changes in the political situation of the central and local governments, and all civil service appointment regulations have had to be adapted in practice. The Ministry of Personnel has previously formulated ad hoc measures from time to time. For example, county magistrates in war zones can be appointed by personnel with military knowledge and county administration experience, and police officers in war zones can be appointed by military officers who have served in the police force, without being restricted by the seniority requirements of the Police Officer Appointment Regulations. All these measures were intended to encourage talent, adapting to the times and local conditions. The Ministry of Personnel has recently referred to past precedents and considered recent facts to formulate provisional measures for the appointment of civil servants during extraordinary times to adapt to the current special circumstances and to supplement the deficiencies of existing regulations. The main points of these measures are as follows: (1) Central or local agencies may deem it valid if there is a need to raise the standards or impose necessary restrictions on the statutory qualifications of civil servants due to special affairs or circumstances. (2) If it is truly difficult to apply statutory qualifications to civil servants in war zones, the competent authority may consult with the Ministry of Personnel on the standards for appointment based on the knowledge, experience, skills, and physical strength necessary for the job in order to meet the needs of the War of Resistance, and those who meet the standards may be assigned accordingly. (3) If past certificates are lost, the competent authority or the superior competent authority may issue a certificate, or two current civil servants of the recommended rank or above may provide a certificate. (4) If a school graduation certificate is lost, the directly responsible educational administrative authority may issue a certificate. (5) Civil servants appointed in war zones who cannot submit their applications for review on time due to special circumstances may have their review and acting periods extended upon approval by the Ministry of Personnel. (6) When a civil servant who has passed the personnel review is reassigned to a position with the same qualifications, they may be exempted from filling out an appointment review form and report to the Ministry of Personnel by telegram for record.

### Churchill Reports on the War Situation

The air war we have discovered is very different from what we had envisioned before the war. Over the past year, there have been a great many empty beds in military hospitals, exceeding 150,000. So far, we feel that the air war is not as serious as we were prepared to endure. In August, 1,075 British civilians died in air raids, with slightly more seriously injured. Even if we lose two or three times more than this, compared to the main issues at stake, no one would call it serious. In August, in addition to minor damage that can be repaired, approximately 800 irreparable houses were destroyed, the Prime Minister continued. The insurance plan for house bombing losses should continue to be studied, and immediate relief should be given to those with low incomes. Those with annual incomes of 400 pounds with dependents and those with incomes of 250 pounds without dependents should be given relief equal to the full amount of their losses. At the same time, the Ministry of Health is now preparing to assist the authorities in coastal evacuation areas with rental matters. (June 6th Reuters dispatch (Continued)

### Zhejiang Tea Export Situation

Chongqing. The Zhejiang Tea Communication published by the Zhejiang Tea Bureau reports that since Chinese goods cannot be exported via Hong Kong, the Hua authorities have decided to export tea along the Northwest Highway to the Soviet Union. Tea exported to the UK, USA, Morocco, and Southeast Asia will be shipped via Shanghai. The amount of tea secretly shipped from Zhejiang to the occupied areas has decreased since the price of tea in Shanghai fell. Last year, a total of 10,000 piculs of tea were shipped from western Zhejiang to the occupied areas, but this year it is more than 6,000 piculs, mostly due to the difference in tea prices between the inland and the occupied areas. Last year, the price of tea in Shanghai was 270 yuan, while the government's purchase price in the inland was only 90 yuan. Tea from western Zhejiang was mostly secretly shipped to Hangzhou and Guangde. This year, the government's purchase price of tea has increased by 13%, and then increased to 15%, while the purchase price in various occupied areas of Shanghai has increased by 16%.

### Random Talks on the European War (3) The Eve of War: British Civilian Life

A "water bridge" is what is called where a canal passes under a road. These "water bridges" were built 150 years ago and are truly engineering marvels. We passed under many brick "water bridges" on the Grand Canal, built when Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo. Others have been rebuilt with reinforced concrete, forming semi-circles spanning new roads. As the boat passed, we heard long-distance buses rumbling under the bridge, creating a rather unusual sensation.

It was July, and dawn in England came quite early. Around three in the morning, the secluded woods were already filled with the chirping of birds. The birds gradually responded to each other, eventually leading to a chorus of hundreds of birds, their melodious and lilting songs being especially pleasing to the ear.

One day, after finishing breakfast, we saw a barge loaded with a very high stack of wood trying to pass under an old bridge, but it couldn't go forward or backward. Most canal bridges in England are arched, made of brick. Although they are old and covered with moss, they are still exceptionally sturdy, rarely requiring repairs. A bridge near Witton, built in 1800, was originally used for livestock passage. Today, the road between London and Birmingham also passes over this bridge, with frequent traffic and trucks weighing up to fifteen tons passing through constantly, which shows its sturdiness.

Leaving the London area, most of the locks are unattended. Therefore, each boat carries a crank. Upon approaching a lock, a child usually runs ahead to use the crank to open the lock and let the boat pass. I saw a girl opening a lock with the crank without any difficulty. When I tried to open a lock for the first time, I made many mistakes and spent a lot of effort before finally getting the lock open. After a while, I became familiar with the process and could use the crank as skillfully as a boat boy.

Canal boatmen pass down their profession from generation to generation. When the Grand Canal Company was established and the canal was put into use, four hundred barges were added, but there was a severe shortage of boatmen. Eventually, sailors from the sea were recruited to drive the new barges. However, because they were not used to it, collisions between boats and locks were frequent in the narrow canals, and it took a long time before things ran smoothly.

The English countryside is characterized by rolling hills, unlike the flat plains of the Netherlands and northern Germany, which are more suitable for canal transportation. We gradually ascended, passing through forty-five locks, and then sailed on the Chiltern Hills at an altitude of about four hundred feet. The Grand Canal meanders through the highlands in three places.

On both sides of the canal, we often saw anglers, all taking it very seriously, sitting quietly by the riverbank, staring intently at where the fishing line entered the water, without moving for hours. They may have simply been sitting by the riverbank away from home to bask in the sun, as it was rare to see them catch any fish. The small boat we were driving was rarely seen by the English, but the anglers paid no attention to it. The single-mindedness of the English is the secret to their success.

Further ahead, the river became higher and the water clearer. Later, we arrived at Rickmansworth, to visit the Walker shipyard. Mr. Walker, the owner of the shipyard, guided us through the canal ship construction process. The shipbuilding is done with teak, which is hard in nature and becoming increasingly scarce, as the developed shipbuilding industry in England is unable to meet the demand. Canal ship construction and repairs are all done with exquisite craftsmanship. Mr. Walker said that shipbuilding must be strong, otherwise, future repairs to the factory would affect its reputation.

Rural boatmen still maintain the traditional hardworking spirit of British laborers. When I went to a village to have my shoes repaired, the shoemaker described the shoe repair process in great detail, as if I had asked him to rebuild a battleship.

The next day, Saturday, city residents came to the countryside for excursions and camping. Many people stopped to chat with us at the tents we had set up by the roadside. London's trains and long-distance buses did a lot of business for weekend countryside trips. Some went five or six miles from the city, while others went more than fifty miles away and returned several days later. Tourists carried guidebooks, so they didn't have to worry about getting lost, and they could freely walk through private fields and pastures, as long as they didn't stray from the path and trample on the crops, they wouldn't be chased away.

The tents we set up in Batchworth were located at the confluence of the railway, the road, and the canal. It was Sunday, and cars and bicycles were constantly passing by, with an average of six hundred vehicles passing by per hour. Every five minutes, a certain railway line brought a batch of tourists from London, crowding together and making a lot of noise. In addition, canal barges loaded with steel traveled north to Birmingham, the engines were rumbling, and the lock gates were opening and closing, all kinds of noises mixed together, and it never stopped all night.

The lock keeper at Batchworth Bridge, seeing a boat passing, would ask in detail about the cargo, the names of the captain and owner, and the destination, recording everything. He told us that an average of eighty barges passed through each day in pairs. His great-grandfather had been guarding the lock since 1794, and three generations had inherited the job, fulfilling their duties, never receiving a penny from the government. Now it was the fourth generation.

We went ashore and wandered around the lock, seeing two pairs of boats coming at the same time. So we asked the lock keeper which boat could pass through the lock first. He replied that the first to arrive should pass first, but sometimes it was impossible to say for sure which boat had arrived first.

This time, two boatwomen were arguing over who should go first, neither willing to give way, causing the bows of the two boats to squeeze into the lock entrance at the same time, making it impossible to pass. The lock keeper hurriedly waved to the boat that he thought had arrived later. After a long standoff, one of the boatmen, impatient with the argument, shouted to the other boatman: "Come on, friend, let's go ashore for a beer and let the wives solve it."

A canal repair supervisor, whom we had known for a short time, invited us to leave the lock and visit his garden, which immediately felt exceptionally quiet. He loved to talk about flowers, and I couldn't help but think of two types of Englishmen who were completely different: one who focused on cultivating a small garden, striving to make all kinds of flowers bloom; the other who was adventurous, crossing continents, trekking across oceans, enduring heat and cold, to protect the great British Empire founded by his ancestors.

Leaving Batchworth and going upstream, we passed through Cassiobury Park, where the grass and trees were lush and green. The National Trust had purchased many scenic areas for preservation, and Cassiobury Park was one of them. The English, who love nature and enjoy sightseeing, strongly support this kind of preservation of scenic spots for public enjoyment. Therefore, the Trust has purchased many forests, lakes, mountains, castles, and villages, considering them public property and preserving them forever.

Late in the day, we passed the sixty-fifth lock and reached Cowroast on the Chiltern Hills, which is 393 feet above sea level, the highest point of the Grand Canal. The inn there was full of boatmen, either playing darts or drinking beer. Near the locks, there were usually public places for boatmen to rest.

We camped a mile past Cowroast. Suddenly, an uninvited guest闯came, asking us directly where we were planning to go. He was also an American, who had originally planned to stow away on a train to cross England, but failed, so he decided to walk.

### Unwilling to Change the Decision on Defense Forces, the US Decides to Take Over the Defense of the Central District, Admiral Hepburn Held Meetings Continuously Yesterday, and Returned to Qingdao by Ship in the Afternoon After the Matters Were Completed

Admiral Hepburn, commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, suddenly arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao on the 4th. During this brief period, he held several meetings with the US Acting Consul-General Mr. Butler and Colonel Baker, commander of the 4th Marine Regiment, to review the general situation in the Far East and discuss the issue of defense zones, making a decision. Hepburn, having completed his official duties in Shanghai, left Shanghai for Qingdao on the US ship Marblehead at 2 PM yesterday. He plans to return to Shanghai on the flagship Augusta in late September. Yesterday morning, around 10 AM, before Hepburn's departure, Colonel Baker and US Consul Butler held another meeting to discuss the various issues of the US military's preparation to take over the defense of District B. Since the Japanese military has already dispatched troops to patrol District D, effectively controlling the area, it is necessary for the US military to take over the defense of District B. Therefore, there will be new developments in the issue of defense zones in the shortest possible time.

The US is Willing to Abide by the Decision on Defense Forces

Yesterday, authoritative sources firmly stated that Hepburn assured his subordinates in Shanghai that the United States would not agree to any changes to the decision made by the Defense Forces Committee regarding the issue of defense zones. The reason why the Japanese military has not formally taken over the "D" district in western Shanghai is that the negotiations between the US and Japan on the issue of defense zones have stalled. Therefore, it is believed that the US 4th Marine Regiment will soon take over the defense of the Central District. The current garrison in that district, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, is originally provisional in nature. However, at the same time, news from the Japanese side firmly claims that the US defense forces will not undertake this task.

The Japanese Military Has Already Controlled District D

It has been a week since the Public Concession and the French Concession jointly implemented special security measures. It was said that they would be lifted soon, but after the incident on the day before yesterday in which bandits on Yu Yuan Road attempted to attack Deputy Chief Inspector Yao Ke of the Municipal Council Police Department, this kind of security measure may be extended after "September 18th". The security situation in the two concessions is also quite tense. Japanese military police randomly conduct inspections of pedestrians and vehicles passing by, and the inspections are even stricter at 3 locations: Brillant Road (west of Zhaofeng Park), Yu Yuan Road Yi Ding Pan Road, and Yu Yuan Road Di Feng Road. Each location is guarded by four Japanese military police and puppet police. The Japanese side has also set up military police headquarters at the Hualegong gambling den on Great Western Road and No. 834 Yu Yuan Road, both guarded by four Japanese military police in front of the door. Military telephone lines have also been erected along the road there, and the work is quite busy.

### Public Bus Labor-Management Dispute Remains Unresolved; Management Declines Labor's Demands

Approximately two thousand workers of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company submitted a request to management on July 6th of this year, seeking improved treatment. The contents included: (1) Management must not dismiss workers without cause; (2) Management must improve workers' treatment as much as possible based on the cost of living index; (3) Daily working hours should not exceed eight hours; otherwise, it will be considered "special work" (special work will be calculated at one and a half times the original hourly wage, and special work lasting less than one hour will also be counted as one hour); and work in the traffic department will be limited to eight hours and no longer increased; (4) Work should cease on Sundays, with one day off granted and wages paid as usual; workers working on Sundays will be paid double; (5) Year-end bonuses should be increased from 5% to 10%, and other various demands, totaling 23 items.

Workers Dissatisfied with Management's Response

Yesterday, this newspaper's reporter learned that management has responded to each of these requests. The most important points include: (1) The company has never dismissed employees without cause, but reserves the right to dismiss those who are incompetent or have improper behavior; (2) The company has automatically increased cost-of-living allowances and rice subsidies, based on fluctuations in rice prices, making treatment better than other companies in Shanghai; (3) Regarding eight-hour workdays, it was originally agreed by both parties, but the traffic department inevitably exceeds it due to complex circumstances, while the mechanical department has never exceeded eight hours; even if overtime is unavoidable, wages are added according to regulations; (4) Regarding holidays, the company already has a regulation of granting one special day off for every nine days worked, and five days off for the Lunar New Year, but since fares for Sunday riders are not doubled, it is difficult to calculate double wages for those who work on Sundays; (5) Annual general wage increases should be based on the company's "Professional Creed", etc. The labor side is not satisfied with this response.

Professional Creed Sparks Dispute

Yesterday, the labor side claimed that this labor-management dispute was actually caused by the company authorities forcing all workers to sign the "Professional Creed" a few months ago. This creed requires filling out a detailed resume and agreeing to the following rules: (1) Wage increases are at the company's discretion, and if my health interferes with my work, I will unconditionally resign automatically; (2) "The company's articles of association may be modified at any time, and I shall absolutely obey them." The labor side believes that accepting the company's creed is tantamount to being at the mercy of management in everything hereafter, and individual lives will be even more insecure. Hence, the aforementioned request for improved treatment was made.

### Enthusiastic Response to National Savings Campaign in Shanghai; Savings Bonds Purchased Reach Approximately One Million Yuan

Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued a letter to the public, calling on the people to practice thrift and national savings, the public in this city has expressed excitement and responded enthusiastically, earnestly promoting national savings to cultivate a frugal lifestyle and achieve the goal of national construction. Furthermore, given the abundance of idle capital in this city and the opportunity for unscrupulous merchants to hoard and speculate, violating the law and harming people, relatives and friends are universally advised to participate in the national savings campaign and to quickly purchase savings bonds or deposit them in banks and post offices, benefiting both themselves and the country, achieving two goals with one action.

Millions in Bonds Purchased; Savings Increase Sharply

Since the National Government promulgated the National Savings Regulations and designated the Central Trust Bureau, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to issue National Savings Bonds, all provinces, cities, and counties across the country have universally promoted them. Although Shanghai has not been ordered to issue them due to its special environment, all sectors believe that saving is beneficial to the future of national construction and themselves. It is understood that the purchase of savings bonds through the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau and various banks has reached approximately one million yuan. In addition, postal savings have also increased sharply compared to before. The commendable virtue of national savings is now being continuously promoted and developed. National Savings Bonds are divided into two types, A and B, with denominations of five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, one hundred yuan, five hundred yuan, and one thousand yuan. These savings are designated for investment in national construction and semi-industrial projects, which are highly secure and offer relatively generous interest rates.

### Memorial for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Hardship on the Anniversary; Silence Observed by All Sectors, Resolve to Emulate His Spirit and Complete the Resistance and Reconstruction; Intensified Efforts to Raise Funds for Winter Clothing

Tomorrow is the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's first uprising, as well as the combined anniversary of the Central Government's designated October 11th Memorial of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's London Hardship and June 16th Memorial of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Guangzhou Hardship, thus it is of great significance. However, all sectors in this city, being in a special environment, cannot hold commemorative ceremonies. Nonetheless, in remembrance of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's arduous efforts in building China and the difficulty of overthrowing the Qing Dynasty's autocracy, they have decided to inherit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, emulate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit, and complete the great task of resistance and reconstruction. At that time, a silent memorial will be observed. All sectors are also aware that with the imminent arrival of winter, the soldiers fighting on the front lines and the compatriots in the rear who have suffered from the disaster urgently need winter clothing. Therefore, the movement to raise funds for winter clothing will be intensified.

### Business Corps Receives Notice to Detain Three Vehicles; Members Pay Full Attention, Then Order Is Rescinded

The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that members of the International Business Corps stationed in the "B" defense zone of the Public Concession suddenly received notice this morning (the 7th) to prepare their weapons, as the Public Concession Police Department requested their assistance in arresting three cars in the western Hongkou district. According to the police notice, the licenses of the three cars were 7995, 5662, and 11717. It is believed that the last car belongs to a certain Russian Jew, but the identity of the owners of the other two cars is unknown. The initial notice received by the Business Corps members was to detain these three cars upon sight. If the cars disobeyed the order to stop, they were authorized to shoot if necessary. However, a second notice was subsequently received from the police, rescinding the previous order.

### Chairman of the French Municipal Council Resigns and Returns Home

To Depart on the 10th

The Shanghai Times reports that it was learned from official sources yesterday (the 6th) that the Chairman of the French Municipal Council, M.J. Brediam, has resigned and is scheduled to leave Shanghai for France last Tuesday. His successor has not yet been appointed.

### Ningbo Deals with the Aftermath of the Bombing

Regarding the various circumstances of Ningbo dealing with the aftermath of the bombing, the Zhejiang provincial organizations in this city received a telegram yesterday: (1) The bombs at the three locations – in front of the Xinbao Huamen on Luotang Bridge Road, inside the bamboo fence on the east side of the cold storage, and in the middle of the Yuelai Lane Heji Longan Shop – have not detonated. The bomb in front of the Xinbao Huamen has been found in the soil about five feet below the ground after days of work and can be retrieved yesterday. The bombs on the east side of the cold storage and in Yuelai Lane are said to have expired and will not explode.

Continuing to Unearth Bodies

(2) Since Ningbo suffered two devastating bombings by Japanese aircraft the day before yesterday, Zhangqi Lane has suffered the most damage and has the most deaths. Three more bodies were unearthed from the rubble yesterday. The names were identified as Ye Anshun, Ye Hesheng, and Ye Wensheng, all of whom died from being crushed. The wife of Xiaohua, the owner of the Sanxing Tea Garden on Zhenming Road, is missing and is rumored by neighbors to be buried in the rubble, so excavation is being intensified. In the rubble inside No. 3 Wutai Lane, the body of a sixteen-year-old girl named Chen Yinfeng was also unearthed the night before last. (3) In view of the bombing situation on the 4th, the people of Ningbo were on high alert. Starting at dawn the day before yesterday, they dispersed to the countryside, and the prosperous city became deserted. They did not return to the city until all the lights were on.

Raising Funds to Provide Coffins

(4) The two bombings of various districts in the city on the 4th caused severe disaster. Many of the affected compatriots are poor people. Therefore, they cannot afford to buy coffins and cannot complete the funeral arrangements. The situation is too tragic to bear. County Magistrate Yu, therefore, together with Zhou Dalie, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, raised 2,000 yuan and also allocated 2,000 yuan from the Relief Association for Compatriots Affected by the Xiaozai Disaster, totaling 4,000 yuan, and ordered the heads of various branches and the police to order coffins from coffin shops, all of which were stored at the Baiyun Bridge Relief Center outside the West Gate for bereaved families who could not afford coffins to claim and complete the funeral arrangements.

### Investigation of French Concession Housing Rental Situation Concluded

Major Landlords and Sub-Landlords Exploiting; Rent Council Determined to Curb It

The "North China Daily News" reports that yesterday (the 6th), it was learned from M. Corguier, Chairman of the French Concession Rent Investigation Committee (Legal Advisor to the French Municipal Council), that the Chinese, French, and Russian groups of the Committee have submitted extremely detailed reports on their investigation of rental housing and rents to the Council. The British and American groups will also submit reports soon. Once all the reports have been completed, the investigation of the rental housing problem and the customs of the Chinese regarding rental housing will be concluded. The Committee will then hold a plenary session to carefully study the reports and submit recommendations to the French Consul-General in Shanghai. The reports are very long, and it is impossible to summarize the main points. It is impossible to predict what the Committee will decide when it holds a plenary session. It is hoped that the Council's resolutions, once approved by the French Consul, will be issued by the French Consulate and implemented in the French Concession, applying to all residents regardless of their nationality. Corguier reiterated the Committee's determination to curb excessive rent increases, the collection of gratuities, and the practice of forcing tenants to buy furniture at fixed prices. He hopes that the Committee can eliminate such exploitation of residents and control subletting, preventing sub-landlords from demanding excessive prices.

### Draft for Shanghai Western Special Police Completed; Bao Wen Concludes Study; Opinion Paper Prepared for Consideration and Approval by Municipal Council

The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that Police Chief Major Bao Wen has completed his study of the proposal for the Shanghai West Joint Police Force presented by Fu Xiaoan. He has prepared a response opinion paper to submit to the Secretary General of the Municipal Council, Fei Lipu, for further consideration by the Council. It is believed that the Municipal Council will send a final response to Fu next week, as both sides have reached an understanding on the more important details related to the establishment of the police force. When asked if both parties would sign an agreement soon, Fei denied it, saying that he could not say whether the criticisms contained in Bao Wen's response would lead to a previously resolved issue. Bao Wen's response will be submitted to the Municipal Council for a final consideration of the matter before replying to Fu. Regarding the meeting of police chiefs of the two concessions and the "municipal government" proposed two weeks ago, it is said that the meeting will be convened soon according to Bao Wen's wishes.

### Kidnapped Jin Benren Rescued

Near Kangjia Bridge on Kangnao Road in western Shanghai, a person driving a private car to the area on the morning of the 5th. Suddenly, several bandits rushed out from the roadside, blocked his way, and threatened him with guns. As a result, they robbed him of more than ten yuan in legal tender and forcibly seized his private car, leaving in a hurry. Afterward, the victim immediately reported to the nearby concession police post to pursue the perpetrators.

Police Pursue

However, since the area belonged to an extra-settlement road, the police could not exercise their duties. He then reported the situation to the nearby puppet "police station." Several armed puppet police officers rushed to the scene and conducted a house-by-house search of the nearby slums in an attempt to apprehend the bandits. When they searched a flat behind the World Funeral Home, they intended to knock on the door and enter to investigate the bandits' whereabouts. Unexpectedly, after knocking on the door several times, a cry for help was heard from inside. The puppet police were surprised to know that something was amiss and immediately

Broke Down the Door

The bandits inside, knowing that things were not going well, opened fire to resist arrest. A battle then broke out, with both sides exchanging more than ten shots. As a result, the bandits ran out of ammunition and were arrested. A person lying on a straw mat on the ground was discovered. It was the kidnapped rice merchant Jin Benren, who loudly called for help. He was then rescued from danger.

### Bombing of British Church in Ji'an to Be Taken Up with the Japanese, Reported to British Consul General in Shanghai

The church of the China Inland Mission in Ji'an City, Jiangxi Province, which displayed British flags and prominent signs, was completely destroyed by Japanese aircraft bombing earlier this month. The missionary Mr. Thiele has now sent a detailed report to the British Consul General in Shanghai, requesting that he take up the matter with the Japanese and demand compensation for all losses.

### Winds Were Quite Strong Yesterday

The observatory reported at 6:00 a.m. yesterday that a Pacific hurricane is currently located at 23 degrees north latitude and 130 degrees east longitude, moving very slowly and still heading north-northwest, having reached the southeast of Okinawa. The tentacles of the hurricane's vanguard have now reached this city. Therefore, there have been irregular sporadic rains since yesterday morning, and the clouds are thick, causing the weather to be uncertain. Another hurricane in the Pacific Ocean had reached 26 degrees north latitude and 140 degrees east longitude at 6:00 a.m. yesterday, heading north-northwest. Furthermore, according to the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, the high tide in the Huangpu River can recede to below one foot starting today (the 8th). Therefore, in the midst of the hurricane warning, the threat of flooding can be avoided. However, there will still be autumn tides in the middle of this month. Yesterday, the tide still flooded the streets.

### US Attitude Very Firm on Maintaining Commercial Rights in Shanghai; Anglo-American Trade in North China Repeatedly Repelled; Commercial Competition Now Concentrated in Shanghai

(Special Dispatch from Da Zhong News Agency) Since Japan launched its military invasion of China, European and American trade in China has been gradually declining due to Japan's interference on the pretext of military needs. Before August 13th, the United States ranked first in China's national foreign import trade, followed by Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. However, since Japan implemented trade controls in North China, trade between third countries and China has decreased sharply, and the market in the occupied areas has been almost exclusively occupied by Japanese goods. According to customs statistics, the changes in the national trade between the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom in recent years are as follows (unit: gold unit):

US Goods Japanese Goods British Goods

Year 26 83,075,141 66,098,123 49,129,745

Year 27 660,008,175 90,481,011 30,836,905

January to August of Year 28 6,249,981 126,555,744 31,242,084

July of Year 29 94,093,000 105,582,000 16,640,000

(Import Comparison) Recently, Japanese imports have increased sharply, doubling compared to before the war. Although US goods have also increased slightly, this is purely due to the need for US cotton. China's domestic cotton is purchased and transported to Japan by the Japanese, and the country must purchase US cotton with foreign exchange. Since last year, there has also been the European war, so the United States has been able to maintain its trade with China without decline, while the United Kingdom and Germany are in dire straits. Even if the European war had not occurred, judging from the trend in 1938, it would inevitably decline. In North China, since the issuance of "United Reserve Certificates" and the implementation of import controls (foreign goods importers are initially limited to 80% of the foreign exchange collected from export goods), Japanese imports account for the absolute majority, while British and American goods lag far behind.

(Shanghai Customs Statistics) However, the legal tender is still circulating as usual in Shanghai, and the trade between the United Kingdom and the United States with China is concentrated in Shanghai. According to customs statistics, the recent trend of industrial competition among the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom in Shanghai is as follows (unit: gold unit):

US Goods Japanese Goods British Goods

Year 26 51,187,489 33,096,362 10,266,195

Year 27 26,523,222 16,154,159 12,962,090

January to April of Year 28 7,415,203 33,014,222 16,068,536

July of Year 29 62,132,569 16,32,429 8,159,353

Politics and economics are inherently inseparable. The result of the great powers' political concessions to Japan is the decline of their rights and interests in China. If the United Kingdom and the United States make further concessions in Shanghai, the collapse of their rights and interests in China will be obvious. The recent firm attitude of the United States towards Shanghai is a necessary step to protect its rights and interests in China.

### Shanghai Ships Sailing to Haiphong and Saigon; Schedule Unchanged; Shipping Industry Says Vietnamese Situation Has Not Changed

The Vietnamese situation, which has been tense for some time, has eased after the Japanese side automatically withdrew the final ultimatum. The Shanghai-Vietnam route has been decided to resume, and details have been reported previously. Unexpectedly, it was reported that France allowed Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam, causing uneasiness in the market again yesterday. Some speculators took the opportunity to become active, and the market price of tapioca actually exceeded the price limit, and the actual price was not announced. Regarding the actual situation in Vietnam, the reporter specifically consulted the foreign shipping industry in this city.

(Schedule Unchanged) It is said that reports on the situation in Vietnam as published in the newspapers this morning (i.e., yesterday morning) have not been received from the ports in Vietnam, so the details are unknown. However, the Taikoo Kiangsu, which is scheduled to resume sailing, will set sail at 3:00 p.m. today, via Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Haikou, to Haiphong. The Kweiyang is also scheduled to depart at 3:00 p.m. today, via Xiamen, Shantou, and Hong Kong, to Siam, and also to Saigon. Although there are not many passengers and cargo being transported, it is determined to depart on schedule without changes.

(Vietnamese Situation Unchanged) Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng, which is scheduled to resume sailing to Haiphong on the 11th, has also begun selling tickets. Therefore, the Vietnamese situation can be guaranteed to be unchanged as of yesterday. This can be confirmed by the fact that the ships resuming the Shanghai-Vietnam route are not changing their schedules. In addition, Taikoo recently transferred the Ansheng, which previously sailed the Nanyang route, with a tonnage of 3,188 tons, to Shanghai to join the Shanghai-Singapore route. The ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and is temporarily docked at its own wharf in Pudong. It is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for the first time to Singapore next Tuesday (the 10th), also serving Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Penang.

### Jiangding Still Not Released

The Jiangding is still being detained and moored at Gaochang Temple. There has been no news of its release. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. The rumor that it was released yesterday afternoon and sailed back to the No. 5 Wharf of the 16th Pier is not true. It has been learned that the ship is currently moored in the southern Huangpu River. As of yesterday afternoon, it has not turned around. The Ruitaide and Daping are also anchored in the area and are not moving. According to the Continental Report, a Japanese naval spokesman denied the reports yesterday afternoon (the 6th) that the German Jiangding was being detained by the Japanese authorities. It is claimed that the investigation has revealed that the Jiangding is not being detained by the Japanese side.

### Ministry of Transportation Regulates Automobile Industry; May Purchase When Necessary; Military Vehicles to Be Repaired First

The Ministry of Transportation, in view of the lack of scrutiny in automobile imports and the fact that merchants are either raising prices according to their needs or replacing new products with old ones due to a lack of supply, or even smuggling goods and selling them privately, urgently needs to implement strict regulations to prevent abuses. Interim measures for the wartime control of companies and firms selling automobiles and repairing automobiles have been formulated and submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council for approval and promulgation. It is understood that these measures have been issued to Shanghai. They are recorded below:

### Japan Denies Arresting Assassin in Attempted Assassination of Yao Ke; Municipal Council Currently Investigating; Remains Silent on Motives

Yao Ke, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Public Concession Police Department, was attacked by two thugs the day before yesterday, but fortunately, they missed. One of the thugs was arrested on the spot by Japanese military police. Yesterday, the Japanese military police department was evasive about the whereabouts of the arrested thug, which was puzzling. According to Japanese newspapers in this city yesterday, both thugs who attempted to assassinate the police chief were at large and had not been apprehended. Yesterday, a Western reporter telephoned the Japanese military police headquarters on North Sichuan Road and was told that the arrested thug was still in custody and an investigation was underway. However, less than five minutes later, a spokesman for the Japanese military police department suddenly called back the Western reporter and said that although the case was under investigation, he could not say for sure whether a thug had been taken into custody. Furthermore, he could not confirm whether the thug was arrested by the Japanese military police. The Municipal Council Police Department also made no comment on the case, only saying that an investigation was underway and remained silent on the possible motives for the case.

### 大同 Dyeing and Weaving Factory Embezzlement Lawsuit

Older brother accuses younger brother of embezzling raw materials; refuses to hand over account books during audit.

The Datong Dyeing and Weaving Factory, located at 580 Beikaier Road, Hongkou, was founded by Kong Chunfang of Zhenjiang. It has been in operation for ten years and has developed successfully. However, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the factory's location was within the defense line, making it impossible to operate and temporarily suspending operations. In August of the 27th year of the Republic of China, the factory resumed operations. However, Kong Chunfang, due to old age and declining strength, entrusted his younger brother, Kong Yongqing, with the position of manager. Recently, Kong Chunfang, alleging that his brother had acquired many concubines and engaged in speculation, secretly transferred cotton yarn from the factory to his Yongfeng Yarn Store and embezzled raw materials worth 50,000 yuan, attempted to go to the factory to investigate the accounts. Unexpectedly, on the 3rd of this month, Kong Yongqing privately withheld 15 important account books from the factory and refused to meet him. Kong Chunfang then, on the 4th, accompanied by lawyer Jiang Pingfan, reported to the Yulin Road Police Station, which dispatched Detective Li Yilian and Inspector Yuan Xinzhong, who arrested Kong Yongqing at 64, Lane 143, Kangti Road in the French Concession yesterday and detained him. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case and requested a postponement. Under questioning, the plaintiff confessed that the factory was jointly established by his brothers, with him as the manager and his brother as the assistant. All the raw materials had been used up successively, and the surplus of over 100,000 yuan last year was also divided equally with his brother. This time, his brother suddenly took away four account books, and as he was the manager and responsible for everything, he removed the remaining account books. Judge Fu instructed the plaintiff to be detained pending a seven-day review and denied the request for bail.

### Coolidge Postpones Arrival in Shanghai, Empress of Russia Arrives Today

The Changxing Company's Empress of Russia mail ship, which departed from Canada on the 27th of last month, stopping at Hong Kong and Luzon, is now returning from Luzon. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai via Hong Kong at 5:30 PM today, docking at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou.

The small vessel for passenger transport will depart from the Customs Wharf at 11:30 PM tonight. The United States President Lines' President Coolidge mail ship, which has returned from Luzon to Shanghai to return to the United States, was originally scheduled to arrive on the 9th (tomorrow). However, according to the company's announcement, the mail ship was slightly delayed in loading cargo in the Philippine port, so the arrival in Shanghai has been changed to the 11th and is scheduled to depart on the 12th to return to the United States.

### Zhenhai City Area Hit by Shells

According to a telegram received yesterday from the shipping industry, a Japanese warship sailing from the north arrived outside Zhenhai Port on the morning of the 6th. Together with the previous ship, there were two ships. At 10:10 AM, they suddenly fired 11 shells at the Zhenhai city area. One shell landed in Qiujiang Alley, killing three people, injuring four, and destroying two houses. One shell landed in Pingjiang Alley, one shell landed at Lin Temple, one shell landed near Linchao, and many shells landed in the sea behind Lin Temple. At 11:00 AM, one ship sailed north. There is still one Japanese warship anchored outside Zhenhai Port.

### Patrol Officer on Avenue Dubail Robbed of Handgun

Two bandits restrained throat, one bandit snatched handgun.

Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, a Chinese patrol officer No. 864 from the French Concession was dispatched to guard the intersection of Avenue Dubail and Rue Lafu. Unexpectedly, three bandits in short clothes suddenly appeared. Two bandits stepped forward, and one bandit approached the patrol officer from behind, suddenly striking his throat, making him unable to speak. One bandit forcefully snatched the service handgun he was wearing and fled with another bandit who was acting as a lookout, disappearing without a trace. Afterwards, the patrol officer reported the incident to the police station and requested an investigation.

### Selecting Domestic Helpers, Forcing Them into Massage Profession, Colluding with Employment Agencies to Lure Them into the Trap, Xu Alin Arrested by the Police

Massage and guidance were originally good careers in the West for fitness and serving society, but once imitated in our country, they have become a kind of disguised prostitution that harms society. Some of the women in this profession are forced by hunger and cold and have no choice but to do this, while others are those who are in charge and use sweet words to deceive them from various rural areas to come to Shanghai. However, once they enter the cage, it is difficult to fly away. For many years, the number of decent women who have lost their chastity and reputation is unknown. If this organization continues, I don't know how many more women will fall into the fire pit. Xu Alin, a native of Yangzhou, opened the Penglai Women's Massage Parlor at 17, 992 Niuzhuang Road. The massage girls she hired were all lured by deception, and none of them were willing. The method of deception is based on the fact that various places are currently suffering from natural disasters and man-made disasters, and those who cannot live, come to Shanghai to make a living, especially women. The only way out for these women is to become domestic helpers, so the employment agencies are full of women waiting to be hired. Taking advantage of this time, they collude with the employment agencies to select women aged 16 to 22 and send them to their massage parlors, claiming they are domestic helpers. However, once the maids enter the massage parlor, they are forced to change their clothes and forced to work as massage girls. If they dare to resist, they will either have their clothes confiscated or be threatened with dangerous words. These women feel unfamiliar with the place and have no help, so they have to endure the pain and serve. The remuneration they receive is only 30 cents out of 2 yuan. Most of the Penglai massage girls are sent by Liu Tongxing Employment Agency on Route Père Robert in the French Concession. There was a woman named Xu Yaying who was just sent by Liu Tongxing a few days ago, and Xu Alin forced her to become a massage girl the day before yesterday. When Xu saw that the men who came were all naked and behaving in all kinds of obscene ways, she couldn't bear the shame and wanted to resign and leave, but she was monitored by the owner of the parlor. So yesterday, she took the opportunity to sneak out and reported to the Zhabei Police Station. Western Head Constable F. R. Howard No. 1013 went to arrest Xu Alin and seized 19 massage girls including Wang Yueying, Zhang Suzhen, Zhu Xiuying, Chen Yuemei, Wang Jinfeng, Yao Caiying, Chen Gendi, Wang Aizhen, Chen Jinying, Xu Laiying, Yao Fengying, Shen Baoying, Zhao Huizhen, Yu Guizhen, Xu Yueying, Zhang Yudi, Shi Meiying, Wang Xiuying, etc. After interrogation, it was learned that they were all deceived by Xu Alin using the above methods. Wang Xiuying (16 years old) was even sent by Xu to the Zhongshan Hotel one day to be raped by a guest, ruining her chastity. The head constable arrested Xu and escorted him to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyers Ru Baoyi and Jiang Baolian prosecuted him for the crime of inducing decent women to engage in indecent acts with others in accordance with Article 233 of the Criminal Law. After detailed interrogation by Judge Huang Risheng, he ordered Xu Alin to be detained pending a further review.

### Fire at a Tent Store on Tokyo Road, Apprentice Girl Burned to Death, Both Bodies Charred Beyond Recognition

The Taichang Tent Store at 225 Tokyo Road in western Shanghai caught fire unexpectedly at around 10:00 AM yesterday. Instantly, flames soared and fire tongues spread in all directions. Once a tent is on fire, it is not easy to put out. When the fire was raging, apprentice Shi Wenbin (16 years old) and Chen Meiju, the six-year-old daughter of a tenant named Chen upstairs, were unable to escape and died in the fire. Later, firefighters dug out the bodies from the rubble. They were charred beyond recognition, making it unbearable to look at. The bodies were sent to the morgue for examination in a hearse. The fire brigade drove to the scene and extinguished the fire after about an hour. Several houses were burned down.

Machine Factory Destroyed by Fire

At 3:10 AM yesterday morning, a machine factory at 348 Avenue Metteunier in the French Concession suddenly caught fire due to carelessness. The fire immediately broke through the roof. Upon receiving the news, the Central Fire Brigade rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire at around 5:00 AM. In addition to the complete destruction of a three-story municipal building in the factory, the fire also spread to a building at 350 next door, causing significant losses. Afterwards, the French police summoned Zhou Fuhai, the owner of the machine factory, for questioning.

### Social News

On the road built beyond the Shanghai Western Boundary, outside the Meilifang Gate on Daxilu Road, at approximately 6:35 PM yesterday, a Route 2 public bus sped by.

They pulled out their handguns, and all 30 or so passengers on board were robbed, with no one spared. The losses are said to be substantial, but the exact amount is unknown. Afterwards, the driver, ticket seller, and others reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station and requested an investigation.

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the Swire Group's Pootung Wharf and warehouses were damaged when the Japanese Navy bombed the Huangpu River water gates in the spring of 1939. Repairs are now being actively carried out. Although the cost of repairs has not been announced, it is said to be very high.

At the home of farmer Xu Qiusheng in Zhujiamu Bridge, south of Mackinnon Road on Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai, more than ten bandits suddenly arrived at around 11:00 PM the night before, breaking into the house. They robbed clothing and silver dollars worth approximately 300 yuan. They then broke into the home of Xu Baixiang next door. Because the homeowner argued with the bandits, he was shot in the right leg by the bandits. It is said that the injury is not serious.

Yesterday morning at 8:30 AM, a Japanese military truck was traveling south on Haig Road. In front of the Tongyanchun Pharmacy on Hongqiao Road, it accidentally hit and knocked down a female vegetable vendor. After driving to the Lijing Bridge in Xujiahui, it hit and knocked down a man, causing serious injuries and endangering his life.

### Suspension of Parcel Post along the Longhai Railway

Regarding the bulk parcel post sent from Shanghai to various cities and counties along the Longhai Railway, the Parcel Business Department of the Shanghai Postal Administration announced yesterday that it would stop accepting such items.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Stirred Up a Huge Wave

In the foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The black market for British and American currency experienced another huge wave, first rising sharply and then suddenly falling back slightly. Initially, it was reported that France had allowed Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam to invade China, causing fear. Chinese merchants and speculators came to dump their holdings, and importers settled 300,000 US dollars. It was rumored that a Japanese bank also settled 400,000 US dollars, but this was difficult to confirm. Therefore, a certain American bank alone supplied more than 200,000 US dollars, and other banks also raised prices to squeeze out supply. For a time, the tightness was very strong. US dollars were still being absorbed by banks at 5.25 yuan, and British pounds also tightened to 3 pence and 4375. Then, news came that the United States and the Soviet Union had reached a certain agreement, and the panic subsided immediately. Chinese banks were willing to supply, and speculators turned to cover their positions. The US dollar immediately returned to a flat rate of 5.34375 yuan, and the British pound also recovered slightly. Finally, it was heard that a certain Chinese bank was absorbing supply, and the market softened again at noon. The closing price was 3 pence and 453125 for British pounds and 5.28125 yuan for US dollars, with British tightening by 0.046875 and US tightening by 0.0625. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Importers Struggled to Buy

In the early morning, London large bars, near and far term, were flat. The New York silver price was still flat, and the London gold price was fixed. The exchange rate for British pounds against US dollars was unchanged, and it was also flat against Shanghai. US dollars were up 3 points against British pounds and there was no market against French francs. The central listed prices for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning: British pounds at 3 pence and 484375 and US dollars at 5.3125 yuan, which was British tightened by 0.015625 and US softened by 0.03125 compared to the previous day's closing. The market was stable after the opening. Foreign firms first traded US dollars for September delivery at 5.34375 yuan, approximately 120,000 yuan. Later, foreign firms suddenly had a large number of settlements, causing the market to tighten. Initially, they sought US dollars for October delivery at 5.3125 yuan from American banks, but the price had softened to 5.25 yuan by the time they entered the foreign firms. HSBC's listed prices were announced in the morning and remained unchanged. The announcement of the silver equalization tax also showed no increase or decrease. After this, speculators also came to buy US dollars for September delivery at 5.21875 yuan, and US dollars for October delivery even fell to 5.1875 yuan. At this time, the American banks' appetite was also strong. It is estimated that foreign firms traded US dollars for September delivery at 5.25 yuan. Later, due to rumors of bearish news, Chinese merchants and speculators came to dump their holdings, and the potential gradually loosened. It is estimated that Chinese merchants sold US dollars for October delivery to foreign firms at 5.28125 yuan, and sold US dollars for September delivery to Chinese banks at 5.3125 yuan to 5.34375 yuan. By noon, foreign firms were selling US dollars for the current month to Chinese banks at 5.3125 yuan. The closing price was 3 pence and 453125 for British pounds, 5.28125 yuan for US dollars, 5.25 yuan for US dollars for October delivery, and 3 pence and 4375 for British pounds, which was British tightened by 0.046875 and US shrunk by 0.0625 compared to yesterday's closing.

### Gold Price Rose Sharply, Then Retraced Slightly, Fluctuating Hundreds of Yuan in Half a Day

Yesterday's black market for spot gold in Shanghai rose and fell with the rumors from foreign telegrams, causing confusion. The price repeatedly broke through the 6,200 yuan barrier but then fell back. Initially, it was seen that France, which had been brewing for a long time, had allowed Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam to invade China. Foreign exchange was already tightening sharply due to the panic buying by speculators, importers, and Japanese banks. People were panicking, and buying sentiment spread. Sellers took the opportunity to hoard. The price opened at a high of 6,280 yuan in the morning in the midst of chaos. After the opening, securities firms and gold shops began to sell, and the buying trend gradually subsided. Suddenly, news came that the United States and the Soviet Union had reached a certain agreement, and foreign exchange began to harden, causing the price to rebound sharply and fall wildly. New bulls rushed to close their positions, and the price immediately fell sharply to 6,170 yuan. Later, following the US dollar market, it eventually rose to 6,195 yuan, a rebound of 30 yuan. There was an example break in the afternoon on Saturday. It was heard that the outside market price had returned slightly lower. More than 4,000 taels were traded in half a day. The price of gold jewelry rose by 10 yuan, to 640 yuan. Customs gold and other items were flat.

Spot Rose by 30 Yuan

In the early morning, the market was very firm due to the tightening of the exchange market. Most people were willing to buy at 5 yuan higher than the listed price (i.e., the opening price). Many transactions took place at that time. Initially, gold shops took in 20 taels from silver shops for 6,280 yuan, an increase of 115 yuan compared to the previous day. Unexpectedly, the market situation suddenly changed after the opening, because the foreign exchange market had reported a loosening at that time, which immediately caused a selling trend. Certain securities firms, gold shops, and retail investors rushed to sell. Around 10:00 AM, the price fell to 6,170 yuan. Later, as the exchange market softened again, the selling trend gradually subsided. Silver shops and money changers took advantage of the low price to strongly raise the price again to 6,230 yuan. Finally, due to the fact that most people were bearish and frequently sold at high prices, silver shops and securities firms made great efforts to supply. Before closing, the price retreated again to 6,190 yuan. The result was a closing price of 6,195 yuan, which was still 30 yuan higher than the previous day. There were still transactions below the closing price after the close, showing a fatigue. There were fluctuations of hundreds and tens of yuan in half a day. The selling price of cash gold at gold shops was several tens of yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current marked gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. There were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Listed 10 Yuan Higher

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at silver shops was initially listed at 630 yuan by Dahang Tong. At 9:30 AM, it was listed 10 yuan higher. There were no changes after this. Dahang Tong changed its listing to 640 yuan. The new shops had similar prices to the previous price, with a buying price reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Also Rose

Yesterday's foreign currency market initially rose sharply due to the report that France had allowed Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam, resulting in high demand for British and American gold pounds. However, it soon fell back, and each eventually rose by one yuan. The British gold note initially rose to 18 yuan and 94 cents, but then suddenly declined, eventually closing at 18 yuan and 72 cents, an increase of 5 cents compared to the previous day. The Singapore note rose by 10 cents, and the falling trend of the Japanese gold note gradually subsided, with the evening market reaching 1 yuan and 43 cents. The supply and demand of the Korean note was even, and the market price stabilized, with the evening market still at 1 yuan and 16 cents.

### Food: Rice Became a Black Market, Prices Invariably Rose, Speculators Boldly, Money Industry Supporting Them

Due to rice merchants' fear of public opinion and political attacks from all sides, the market for foreign rice deemed buying and selling Du rice on the black market outside of the market to be safer, and is a model for all to follow. The market no longer sees formal transactions for foreign rice. If there are transactions, they are nothing more than lower quality goods, and I will replace them with rush goods. Formal transactions in the market are less than a thousand bags. The black market for foreign rice is also as endless as the black market for japonica rice. There is talk of 64 or 5 yuan for No. 1 Saigon Siam fire mixed. There are sayings of 61 or 2 yuan for No. 2 and small mixed, and because the evaluation of the original packed English Chinese company No. 2 Siam and No. 2 Saigon is only 71 and a half yuan, and the black market had already exceeded it, yesterday there was talk of 73, 4, and 5 yuan. The asking price for the spot and original packaged black markets are generally one yuan higher than the previous day. Currently, the rice market has long been monopolized and speculated on by large households. Rumors abound in the market, and new tricks are constantly being invented. No wonder the general public is blindly deceived. Therefore, formal sales were still cautious yesterday, while floating hoarders and retailers were still active. The total number of transactions, including original packages, was still 6 or 7 thousand bags. Because the money industry supports them, they can mortgage and lend, so the hoarders are bolder. It is rumored that No. 1 Saigon has reached 65 yuan again, fire mixed 64 yuan, No. 2 Saigon 62 and a half yuan, No. 2 Siam and small mixed 61 yuan, rice tea 51 yuan, which is an increase of 2 yuan over the previous evaluation. Only Tokyo second-class cypress tip and red rice are still on the right track, opening at 56 yuan.

Slightly more japonica and glutinous rice arrived yesterday, totaling 1,300 to 400 bags. Rumors said that the market sentiment in the open and black markets was more stable, because the prices had already been raised so high, and the general cargo owners also knew that it was not easy to raise them further. They no longer insisted and were willing to open at the previous prices, so the selling prices were still neither up nor down. Changbang Qing japonica was 77 or 8 yuan, Changzhou Sukun japonica was 75 or 6 yuan, next to Su 72 or 3 yuan, Qingjiao thin rice 72 or 3 yuan, Nangang original packaged early rice 71 or 2 yuan, Hulu Jian was from 69 and a half yuan to 68 and a half yuan, Jinli special yuan 70 yuan, Changdan Baiyuan 68 or 9 yuan, Hong Kong glutinous special from 70 yuan, medium to 64 or 5 yuan. As for the new japonica and new sheep tips, the arrivals were also not weak, estimated to be 40 loads of Zhoupu japonica, 16 loads of Zhuanqiao japonica, and 22 loads of Taicang sheep tips, totaling no less than nearly 100 loads, so although the sales were lively like foreign rice, the market was difficult to increase and presented a fixed situation. Zhoupu japonica was sold at 69 yuan, Zhuanqiao japonica at 69 and a half yuan, Taicang sheep tips at 63 or 4 yuan for the original package, and Hulu Jian at 60 yuan.

### Flour Market Firm

Flour: The market was consistently firm yesterday. Since the original factory's flour supply has been reduced, the demand on this street has long exceeded the supply. Moreover, the goods returned to the market are also felt to be scarce, so Fuxin and old brands are not available for purchase in whole amounts. Although the factory price is still 15 yuan, the retail market price varies greatly. Recently, the Phoenix brand of Japanese factory flour has been taken up by customers, and has become a business item for speculators. Yesterday, due to the rise in rice prices, new hoarders absorbed heavily, and the price rose by 5 cents to 1 dime. It is estimated that the opening spot Phoenix was 14 yuan and 7 dimes, September 14 yuan and 9 dimes and a half, and October 15 yuan and 3 dimes and a half, with 4,500 bags traded. Also, 1,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Xiamen today.

Wheat: Transactions were still quiet yesterday, because the supply from the interior was limited, and it was even more difficult to import into the concessions. Although the appetite of Chinese factories and export firms was good, there was no large amount to be collected. Moreover, the transactions of brokers are like smuggling goods and are not formally public. Yesterday, it was heard that Kuntai wheat was still 25 yuan and 35 cents, with one or two hundred bags taken for export. The Japanese factory's import price was still only 21 or 2 yuan, with about two or three thousand bags collected. Also, 980 bags of wheat will be shipped to Xiamen today.

### Yarn and Cotton: Inventory of Yarn Increases Daily, Knowing That Hoarding Yarn is Not a Solution, Thinking About Disease From Foreign Exchange Again

The yarn market is still not far from the hovering zone. Although Hong Kong firms have not made large-scale purchases, the demand for designated yarn has improved somewhat, so some people are looking high and delaying imports. In general, cautious people, in view of the gradual increase in yarn inventory, such a situation, accumulated over time, hoarding is not a fundamental solution, so the public psychology is still inclined to think about foreign exchange. Therefore, those holding goods are as quiet as usual.

The market situation for spot yarn opened flat in the morning, with 20-count Double Horse priced at 1,015 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan. Later, it was heard that the exchange rate had shrunk and then risen again. At the same time, the news that the border crossing allowed Japan to pass suddenly caused a false wind, falling to 1,012 yuan, but Tianjin firms suddenly came to collect two or three hundred bags, and the situation rebounded to 1,019 yuan. However, Kangji Bank still sold out. The closing price was 1,018 and a half yuan. The transaction statistics for half a day were 2,620 bags. The market for 20-count Double Horse rose by 3 and a half yuan. Today, 75 pieces of cotton yarn will be shipped to Xiamen, 1,415 pieces to Hong Kong, 45 pieces to Haikou, and 265 pieces to Siam. The amount of purchases by various firms is listed as follows:

Peers 1,730 Hong Kong 875

Xiamen 5 Fuzhou 9 Total 2,620

### Long-Fiber Cotton Nearly Searched Out

Current cotton trading is still good, but sparser than yesterday. Factories only showed some interest in purchasing new cotton, while otherwise remaining quiet and inactive.

Brazilian Cotton 260.00 Shenxin purchased 35 bales

Dazhongji 202.00 Shenxin purchased 85 bales

Dazhongji 32.00 Shenxin purchased 97 bales

Mitterling 263.00 Yuancheng purchased 100 bales

Brazil 258.40 Yuancheng purchased 167 bales

Pingguoer 139.50 Shenghe purchased 100 bales

Pingguoer 140.00 Yongda purchased 100 bales

Another report: Overseas cotton prices. The New York cotton market was slightly weaker yesterday, with public selling and some long positions being closed out. As a result, the closing price fell by five to six pounds compared to the previous day. India was closed yesterday, with predictions of another rupee increase.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading has been particularly active recently, especially for long-fiber cotton. This is because this type of raw cotton is very scarce in the market, and overseas shipping is inconvenient with extraordinarily high war risk insurance rates. Foreign firms require payment before shipment, which is quite inconvenient. Factories have a strong need, so they have been aggressively searching the market in recent days, and the long-fiber cotton in the market has almost been completely searched out. Therefore, the price of cotton has been rising sharply in recent days.

### Piece Goods: Buyers Have Strong Stockpiling Intentions, Market Temporarily Stabilized

Domestic Cloth: Yesterday the market was peaceful, and sales prices showed little change, varying by only one or two jiao per bolt. In reality, Shanghai's export sales are obstructed, with supply exceeding demand. However, due to the lack of a consistent source from the inland, various goods are very popular. Therefore, buyers from Shanghai merchants are very interested in purchasing goods in Shanghai and are continuously stockpiling large quantities, which has stabilized the market. Yesterday, this street's transactions totaled over 500 pieces, with Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants purchasing over 200 pieces of dyed cloth and twill, Northern traders from Yantai and Tianjin purchasing over 100 pieces of coarse cloth and flannel, and merchants from Southeast Asia purchasing over 8,000 pieces of dyed cloth, twill, and bleached cloth. Recently, the autumn bargain sales situation in the shops on this street is slightly worse than last year. The largest stores have daily sales amounts of about 40,000 yuan each.

Eastern Cloth: Trading is not high, but the market sentiment is very firm. White cloth, the leader, is hovering around 32.9 yuan, an increase of 2.5 jiao per bolt compared to the previous day's market price. Four Gentlemen Serge is still priced at 9 jiao 3 fen 2.5 li due to the current cheap sale price by the firms, but most people expect the price to rise.

Exports: There were 1,155 pieces of piece goods exported to Hong Kong today, 265 pieces to Xiamen, 2 pieces to Haikou, and 215 pieces to Siam.

### Grains: Soybean Trading Starts, Oil Bean Imports and Exports Are Very Active

Yesterday's soybean market situation remained good, but its potential was not showing a violently rising trend. Due to the disappearance of speculators and the actual sales market not being overwhelmed, the scope of fluctuations was not broad, causing the overall situation to remain in a hovering pattern. Since the continuous rise in recent days, trading has also begun. Yesterday, the activity continued, and market prices were seen to rise even further. It is estimated that over 1,000 bags of Qingdao beans were handled by Nanyang Port merchants on this street, with prices rising from 34.5 yuan to 37.5 yuan. Over 500 bags of Sangyuan beans were priced at 34.3 yuan to 34.85 yuan. Over 200 bags of Anqing beans were priced at 34 yuan. 300 bags of Wuhu beans were priced at 32.4 yuan. 200 bags of Nanjing beans were priced at 33 yuan. 97 bags of Taicang new soybeans were priced at 36 yuan. Hundreds of bags of Pudong soybeans and Chongming soybeans, and 150 bags of Chongming yellow sand beans, and 200 bags of Dalian mixed green beans.

Also, there were 1,195 bags of beans and 1,000 bean cakes, and 975 cans of raw oil shipped to Xiamen today. In addition, 520 bags of raw peanuts, 1,570 cans of raw oil, 370 bags of beans, and 1,240 bean cakes were shipped to Hong Kong. Also, 685 bags of sesame were shipped to Siam.

In addition, 3,070 cans of raw oil arrived from Qingdao yesterday.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar is Flat and Weak

Yesterday's sugar market trend was flat and weak. The association's listed prices are: spot No. 24 coarse white, new goods in this warehouse, 78.2 yuan; goods arriving in May, 77.5 yuan; goods arriving in April, 76.8 yuan; re-exported goods, 62.5 yuan; Dutch red sugar, spot, 63.8 yuan; goods on the way, 63 yuan. Taikoo granulated white B mark is still 77 yuan, the lower grades are slightly lower, DY mark 73 yuan, HX mark 72.7 yuan to 72.5 yuan. Domestic sugar only had asking prices, no transactions. Also, 1,160 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Hardware: Native Nails and Wire Rods Rise Together

Yesterday, the market prices of native factory wire nails and wire rods both showed increases. The reasons are now described in two points as follows:

Native Nails: Native factory wire nails, after the drastic changes in the exchange rate on May 2nd, the asking price soared to a peak of 85 yuan. The high spirits of the industry can be seen. They purchased raw materials (wire rods) for nail making from overseas. Afterwards, due to the obstruction of the northern supply channels and the blockade of domestic sales, coupled with the deteriorating situation in Southeast Asia, overseas transactions were insignificant. Moreover, the sales market for construction businesses on this street was small, leading to a slump in the native nail market. In addition, overseas orders arrived from time to time, resulting in an oversupply, and the market price plummeted, even falling to 40 yuan. Many people suffered losses. However, recently, the Yantai merchants have risen to handle the business, and the construction businesses in this city have also gradually become active. Therefore, the market has recovered, and the asking price yesterday was 50 yuan per barrel, an increase of 4 to 5 yuan compared to before.

Wire Rods: The raw material for manufacturing native nails, also known as wire, its market trend mostly rises and falls with native nails. The previous and yesterday's native nail market prices were firm, and there were many inquiries for goods, and the standards also continued to increase. The selling price per dan was also around 50 yuan, and there were many purchases, mostly by the nail factories on this street.

### Seafood: Dried Mussels Are Scarce and Prices Rise Frequently

Dried mussels have recently been in short supply due to intermittent sources, and market prices have been rising accordingly. Currently, medium-sized Western mussels have risen from 170 yuan to 190 yuan. Other domestic products, such as Ningbo dried mussels, have sold for 310 yuan, and the momentum is particularly strong.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds are Extremely Strong and Unstoppable, Rising for Eleven Consecutive Days... Up Over Four Yuan

The over-the-counter market for securities, yesterday's market conditions, actually saw another round of increases. Most people predicted that Class C would be 55 yuan, yesterday the market was only one jiao short, unfortunately it was unable to break through. According to the bond market's rising trend, from August 26th to yesterday, it has risen for eleven days. Although there have been one or two minor corrections in between, the closing price on that day has always been higher than the price of the next day. The extension of the rising trend for so long was truly unexpected. Although credit is loose, there has been no increase in demand for remittances, which can be seen from the daily decline in the discount market price. The talk of new loans has been going on for a long time, not only has it not materialized, but repeated denials from all parties have made people even more uneasy. Vietnam's allowance of passage, the invasion of Yunnan is inevitable. The difficulty in easing the tightness of the paper currency market is sufficient to prove that the situation is still very chaotic. Yesterday's market price for Class C initially approached the 4 yuan mark. The bulls, fearing its decline, had no choice but to struggle again. Therefore, in the afternoon, one side bravely pulled up the price, while the other side was already looking for ways to escape, but the methods are not something outsiders can see. In short, the market price has risen by more than four yuan. The short covering was at its peak yesterday, which made the surface more crowded. A turnaround is inevitable. Kang, Jiufeng, and Hongda have been buying in for many days, and yesterday they felt satisfied. Yitai, on behalf of a trust company, has bought in a very considerable amount. The shorts, unable to withstand the pressure, also covered a large amount. Lianyi and Hengfu took advantage of the high prices to leave the market. Most retail investors covered their positions. The bull's wall is being built higher and higher. When the moon is full, it wanes, this is an unchanging principle. Yesterday's results, continued to rise by another three to seven jiao, all seeing new high prices again. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.6 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:

Stock Trading: 200 shares of Hanyeping Coal and Iron Company were traded at a price of 3.5 yuan.

London, 6th (Friday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds and Far East British companies' stocks only saw bank stocks continue to improve. Jardine Matheson Bank continued to rise by one shilling and two pence, priced at six pounds eight shillings and nine pence. All others remained unchanged.

### Today's Day of Prayer

Both the President of the United States, Roosevelt, and the British Monarch, George VI, have designated today, September 8th, as a national day of prayer. Churches throughout the United States, Britain, and Shanghai are preparing to hold special services today, so that Christians everywhere can repent and reflect, pray for divine guidance, and promote the innate conscience to explore the path to luminous truth. The intention is supremely good.

On the surface, this may seem like just another religious ceremony, not worth noting. Especially in a religiously conservative nation like Britain, a national day of prayer is not uncommon. However, from another perspective, Britain is currently in a historically unprecedented and critical period. Every action, whether military, political, domestic, or diplomatic, is of utmost importance. How could those in power act carelessly? The ancients said, "If you offend Heaven, even prayer is futile." Britain's traditionally imperialistic policies, which only care about their own interests regardless of the life or death of others, were bound to face a day of "retribution." To put it bluntly, what they are experiencing now is just the beginning of reaping what they sowed. The suffering they will endure in the future may be a hundred or a thousand times greater.

What is the true meaning of prayer? First, it must be understood that prayer is an active action, the true expression of the Christian spirit. Second, prayer is the source of spiritual unity, an essential element for achieving victory. When an individual is at the brink of life and death, or a nation faces a critical moment of survival, and all possible human methods have been exhausted, the last hope lies in praying to Heaven. However, such prayer is merely temporary and responsive, not grasping the true essence of prayer. If an individual, or even an entire society or nation, seeks success in life, they should incorporate the spirit of prayer into their daily lives, integrating life with prayer, and building all hopes and beliefs upon prayer.

An American businessman said that a successful life should begin with living prayer. He believes that prayer should not be like an old monk chanting scriptures, "saying the words without the heart," nor should it be a "begging" posture. Because most people—those who consider themselves devout Christians—often open their eyes in the morning and say, "Lord, give me this... Lord, give me that," and after a while, they say again, "God, please save me from doing this... Please bless me so that I can do that... Please grant me great grace..." While asking for this and that, they neglect the prayer in the Lord's Prayer, the mere words "Thy will be done."

Let's examine the words "Thy will be done." Does "Thy" refer to the one who prays or the one who is prayed to? If it refers to the one who prays, then the person reciting the prayer need not ask for anything and can simply do as they please. Instead, one should abandon the self, eliminate ego, eradicate selfish and self-serving notions, and express sincere obedience to the divine. Only then is prayer reasonable, only then is it a way to extend oneself to others. Many truly capable people are defeated. Why? Because they overly value their own self-interest and have not embarked on the path of reasonable prayer, encountering only a "second-rate" life. Beyond their own small selves, they have never experienced the vast garden of obedient living. Their prayers are merely requests.

The so-called "Thy will be done" should not be passively waiting for God to "bestow" all blessings. One should always transform passive "waiting for fulfillment" into active "doing." The famous social reformer Theodore Parker put it well: "The man who prays well does not call God to do the work of man, but first prays for repentance, prays for detachment, and then prays for action—imploring with heart, head, and hand together." Therefore, the one who prays reasonably well, when praying, acts as if everything depends on God; and when working, acts as if everything depends on themselves. Thus, what is sought is in Heaven, but what is done is still up to oneself!

In this season of bloody war in Europe, the philosophy of dictators running counter to the Way is nothing more than taking "My will be done" as the center. However, it must be said that such dictatorial behavior can be found everywhere in the world, not just in Europe. These people specialize in doing things that "harm others without benefiting themselves." If they were willing to replace "My" with "Thy," wouldn't that be wonderful?

The famous British writer Stephen Foot, in his article "We Must Arouse the Power of Britain," said that the source of strength for a person who is fearless in the face of danger, willing to discard their own selfishness, and willing to complete the sacrifice, comes from only one place. He knew that during the last war, two senior British officers risked great danger and received medals. One was a brigadier who was unusually respectful of the divine, always with the Bible by his side, and kneeling when praying. The other was an air force officer who once heard many comrades discussing the issue of divinity and showing some disdain for religion. This officer initially listened silently, but later stood in front of the fireplace and said, "Friends, I have heard all your words. What I want to say is that I am older than you. I consider the few achievements in my life that I can boast about to have been accomplished through the spirit of Christ."

Stephen Foot also said that in times of national crisis, the responsibility of Christians lies in arousing the hearts of the nation. We must possess the spirit of resolve, calmness, unity, and inspiration. Resolve should be guided by God's plan, with the determination to eliminate evil and pursue purity. Calmness comes from the love of Christ, where nothing disturbs the heart. Inspiration is the inevitable result of listening to God's will. The miracle of the French maiden Joan of Arc came from this.

The first British admiral, Nelson, was a firm believer in prayer. In the moments before the Battle of Trafalgar, he knelt at his desk in the flagship cabin and wrote his "prayer for victory" in his diary: "May my beloved God, for the benefit of all of Europe, grant our country a great and glorious victory; so that everyone will deeply restrain themselves, with no harm to the nation; and after victory, may benevolence and righteousness always abide in the British Navy. I personally entrust my life to the Creator, may His glory bless my passion, so that I may faithfully serve my country. I commit myself to the presence of God, so that I may defend the nation with justice. Amen."

In short, prayer is the essence of goodness, purity, and upright thought. When praying, one should carefully consider what is being said, striving to make thoughts substantial and real. Only then will what is prayed for have power, and this power will be a part of our body, mind, and spirit.

### Rise and Fall of American Movies and Music (Conclusion)

Alright! Now that Class C theaters are showing two full-length films per screening, the increased ticket revenue is more than enough to pay for the low rental price of another film. The owner of the Class D theater on the corner, seeing that his business was about to become slow, also quickly followed suit by showing two full-length films per screening. In this way, they learned from each other, step by step, pushing it upwards, even reaching the "first-run" Class A theaters. To compete with the "second-run" Class B theaters, they had no choice but to show two full-length films per screening. The theaters that specialized in Paramount films were doing this, and the theaters of the Fox Company were also doing this. Thus, like a contagious disease, the whole country became ill.

What is particularly sad is that the so-called two-film screenings are not just showing a new film paired with an old film. Now, it has become even worse, with two brand-new films being shown consecutively in the same screening! There is even a theater in Chicago that shows two full-length films, including previews and short miscellaneous films, for a total of six hours, but charges only the price of one screening! And a movie theater in Kansas offers patrons not only three full-length films for a dime but also a free full-course meal! As for the gifts offered by various theaters, there is an even wider variety: tea cloths, kitchen knives, tea, encyclopedias, imitation jewelry, pastries, ice cream, lecture folders, dictionaries, coffee, candies, razor blades, silverware, silk stockings, and the Harvard Classics. If you want to furnish your home, you can simply go to the movie theater!

Going to the movies was originally a leisurely entertainment, but under the current prevalence of the two-film system, everyone is beginning to dread it. What parent would want their children to sit in the dark for up to six hours? Not only is sitting still tiring, but it also damages eyesight, making it a losing proposition. Therefore, parents everywhere have written many letters asking for the movie screening time to be shortened.

In addition to customers' reluctance to go to the movies, Hollywood itself is also in a precarious situation, like a prisoner awaiting their final fate. Besides the lack of customers, other reasons are also quite important. One is the increase in film production costs, especially the salaries of stars, while at the same time, profits are decreasing. Secondly, sales are sluggish due to the impact of the war. Forty percent of the revenue from the American film industry comes from overseas. Because of the European war, that revenue has decreased by seven percent, three percent of which comes from Brussels, The Hague, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Antwerp. In addition, investment in films has also been reduced due to the war. However, the war has also helped the film industry in one or two ways. Because most of the films are now sold domestically, there is less concern or interference from foreign countries. In the past, there were often several films with good themes and plots, but they were abandoned due to government warnings.

Radio has now become a powerful rival to movies. "Fortune" magazine recently conducted a survey among the public regarding the choice between the two. The result was that as many as 79% of respondents would rather give up movies and replace them with radio. This is truly a bolt from the blue! Radio has three advantages over movies: (1) Radio is free. Except for the initial purchase of the radio and a small maintenance fee, there are no other expenses. (2) Convenience. People who listen to the radio do not have to travel into the city or twist and turn. They can enjoy it simply by sitting at home. (3) Selectivity. You can listen to whatever program you like with just a wave of your hand. On the other hand, if you don't like the movie that is being shown in the theater, nine out of ten people will just have to sit there and try to recoup their "investment," but you have already developed a negative reaction to any film. This is like sealing a letter and putting on a stamp. If you want to reread what is written on that letter, few people, except for those with a very strong will, are willing to sacrifice the stamp.

The progress of television poses an even greater threat to movies. The general public likes to go to the theater because humans are social beings, but this is only one aspect. Movie makers only need to work hard on "authenticity." If this can be achieved, it can far surpass radio.

The originator of the two-film screenings was a movie theater in Harvard, Massachusetts, as early as 1916. As for the motivation and how it happened, there is no way to know. The initial reason was probably that a neighboring theater had the same program but charged a slightly lower price. This theater was unwilling to lower its price, so it charged customers the price of one screening but showed them two films. The neighboring theater, of course, knew about this clever trick, so they imitated each other, creating the trend of two-film screenings.

In this time of instability for the film industry, fortunately, American music has recently gained widespread attention. Originally, because of the great development of radio broadcasting, the United States can be said to be the country with the most listeners in the world. However, from the perspective of classicism or conservatism, American culture always has a "metallic taste," and music is no exception. To put it bluntly, America has long been seen as a "country that does not understand music." But now everything has changed, and the previous judgments can no longer stand. Dr. Hanson, director of the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester, strongly refuted this view. His main idea is: America's contribution to music education in the world that is most worthy of attention is the promotion of symphony orchestras in secondary schools. This is the newest and relatively unnoticed thing. The beginning of this new era in music began twelve years ago, when students with musical talent were selected from many secondary schools and organized into a 300-member symphony orchestra. Initially, it was guided by Dr. Hanson. The scope of music was originally relatively narrow and had an air of dignity. For hundreds of years, its foundation was almost entirely built on a small number of special classes of people. But now, this closed atmosphere has been opened up, fully embodying the spirit of populism, and American boys and girls can all be bathed in the blessings of music education. In recent years, many major symphonies have been conducted by American musicians from American public schools. And many famous foreign music conductors have praised the greatest musical works in the world today as coming from the hands of American composers. This is clear evidence that American music has been valued by the world. Dr. Hanson also said that no matter what the facts are, no matter how long the time has passed, the aspirations and insights of the great artists and the experience we have gained are all in agreement and will always be in harmony. Due to this kind of spiritual effect, harmony, empathy, and tacit understanding among human beings can mutually grow with beautiful things, and the populist spirit of America should be guided by this. Also, Mr. Gilskin, deputy director of the Adult Education Group of the Chicago Works Project Administration, advocated that everyone use their spare time to develop their cultural activities. Paying attention to the cultivation of the temperament of men and women and the inculcation of aesthetic education, advocating music education is of course also part of what he advocates.

### Antithetical Couplet for Donation Bureau

The patrol officers and detectives hired many assistants to search for illegal activities, while they themselves freely spent money in opium dens and restaurants. This is what all the donation bureaus are like. Yesterday, it was said that someone gave them a couplet: "We merchants run small businesses, we must impartially contribute daily according to regulations, only Heaven can witness. May your esteemed bureau wield great power, do not let your subordinates chase shadows, and divide the spoils while sitting." Because it is in the tone of a businessman, the phrasing is not well-crafted, but the sentiment can be seen.

### Butcher Mei's Realization

A certain person in the eastern part of Yangzhou City made a living as a butcher. At the crack of dawn, the sound of knives could be heard. He would skin and scrape the animals, and then use a pot of hot water to clean and polish them. However, recently, this person suddenly contracted an illness. His whole body itched terribly. He consulted doctors, but they could not determine the cause of his illness. When the itching became unbearable, he had to bathe in boiling water to find relief. Later, he realized, "I treated animals this way, and now Heaven is treating me this way. It is only right." So he abandoned his butchering business, and his illness was cured.

### Elegant Jest About an Illness

A certain licentiate from Zhangmen recently had a grandson. He widely distributed ginger soup. When seeing off guests at the bottom of the stairs, he broke his foot. He urgently summoned a surgeon, who splinted it with boards and bound it with rope. The next morning, a guest went to visit him. Seeing his condition, he smiled and said to the old man, "Your grandson can truly be said to 'rope his ancestors' footsteps'!" Everyone who heard this burst into laughter!

### Chatting About Vietnam

— Yan Maode

These past few days, the Vietnam issue has filled the pages of every newspaper, causing the people of our country to immediately pay attention to Vietnam. Vietnam was originally a vassal state of our country but later became a French colony. Therefore, I will briefly introduce Vietnam's location, transportation, agriculture, and customs, so that children can have a deep impression of it!

Politically, Vietnam is divided into five parts: Tonkin (also known as Bắc Kỳ), Annam (also known as Trung Kỳ), Cochinchina (also known as Nam Kỳ), Cambodia (also known as Cao Miên), and Laos (also known as Lạng Xang). France has placed a governor-general in Hanoi, Tonkin, and a deputy governor-general in Saigon, Cochinchina, to govern the military and civilian affairs of Vietnam.

Location: Vietnam is located in the southeast of Asia, in the eastern part of the Indochina Peninsula. It is bordered by the three provinces of Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong in our country to the north, Myanmar and Thailand (Siam) to the west, the Gulf of Tonkin and the South China Sea to the east, the Indian Ocean to the south, and the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest. Its area is about four times the size of Fujian Province in our country.

Transportation: Vietnam's land transportation is mainly railways, with about 1,400 miles of railways completed. The coastal trunk line from Hanoi to Saigon has been connected. Railways have also been built from Haiphong to Kunming and from Hanoi to Zhennanguan in Guangxi. People from the southeastern provinces of our country often take the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to go to Yunnan. As for waterways, there is the Red River (the upper reaches of which are the Fulang River in our country), and its port, Haiphong, is a must-pass for ships, exporting rice, silk, and the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, from which it goes to the sea.

Agricultural Products: Vietnam's agriculture is the most prosperous, and its rice production is famous throughout the world. The Saigon rice we eat now comes from Vietnam. In addition to rice, there are also many other agricultural products, such as wheat, cotton, tobacco, soybeans, peanuts, corn, pepper, tea, rubber, coconuts, and sugar cane.

The Vietnamese people resemble our people in appearance, but they are short and have slightly darker skin. Their language is very similar to our language. The clothing is the same for men and women. When going out, they all wear a large bamboo and palm-leaf hat, but they are lazy and do not know how to make progress.

### A Genuine Children's Picture Magazine

— Yi Ying

The children's picture magazine I want to introduce here is not published by any publishing house, but is run solely by a child. He does everything himself: editing, writing, and publishing. It can truly be called a genuine children's picture magazine.

One day, I went to visit a friend named Shen. As soon as I sat down, I noticed a colored drawing on the wall. It depicted an open book, with pictures on the top half and words on the bottom half. The picture showed many airplanes engaged in battle. Some were falling straight down from the clouds, with black smoke trailing from their tails. The markings of small red circles could be vaguely seen on the fuselages. The words on the bottom half read:

Little Painter Brother's Edited and Drawn Little Picture Magazine

—Special Issue on Air Combat—Subscribe Now!

Subscription fee: one small apple or two small bananas per issue.

Note: Inferior goods will not be accepted, rotten goods will not be accepted.

Ah! It turned out to be a small advertisement. I couldn't help but ask Mr. Shen, "What is this thing?"

Mr. Shen smiled and said, "This is my eldest son Huimin's creation. Huimin likes to draw and is always scribbling. Once, he had a sudden inspiration to run a picture magazine by himself. He made up his mind, drew pictures, and wrote explanations, but he didn't allow anyone else to take a peek. He was busy for four or five days, almost forgetting to eat and sleep. Sure enough, he bound a small picture book and named it Little Picture Magazine. At first, his only subscribers were his younger brother and sister, but later it expanded to

the children in the house and the children in the neighborhood. He can actually receive ten or so apples or bananas each time.

Mr. Shen casually took out a few previous issues of the picture magazine from the small bookcase and handed them to me to look at. I flipped through them from beginning to end and found them very interesting. I couldn't help but say, "No wonder the children are willing to send him apples and bananas to eat."

Here is a page from the Little Picture Magazine:

Children, after reading the above introduction, please don't suspect that I am the salesman of the little painter Huimin, wanting to attract more subscribers for him so that he can eat one or two more apples. (His picture magazine only publishes one copy per issue, and it's not even enough to supply the existing subscribers.) I just think this is a good idea and worth introducing to the children in Shanghai to do the same: either work alone, or cooperate with a few people, or form groups to run different types of magazines, exchange them, and compete with each other. During this wartime, when the children's picture magazines of Shanghai's major bookstores have stopped publishing and everyone is clamoring for a lack of spiritual food, why don't the children follow Huimin's method and run a few genuine children's picture magazines themselves, supplying their own spiritual food? At the same time, they can also take this opportunity to practice drawing, writing, and composing.

### Shirley Temple's Autobiography (13)

— Min

The work of being a representative, although very hard, is still something that many girls want to try. My mother receives letters every day from mothers all over the country, and even from Europe. Those letters are accompanied by photos of their daughters, saying, "Doesn't my daughter look like Shirley? She would be very willing to be Shirley's representative. Would you possibly agree?" But my mother can only write back and refuse one by one, because I already have a representative.

Not long after, my father went back to work at the bank. One day I heard him say to my mother that the situation had not improved, because his salary had been greatly reduced. They thought I wouldn't understand what they were saying, so they didn't avoid me, but when my two older brothers, Jack and Sennan, were nearby, they stopped talking.

My mother wanted to find some work for me in other film companies, but unfortunately, people didn't really need me. In each small film, I only needed to work for one or two days. My father once said to my mother that there was no need to plan for films anymore. He said that there were already three hundred gold dollars in my name in the bank. All the money I had earned from working in seven films in the past year was in it. When I grew up and went to university, it would probably be enough for one semester's tuition.

My mother was always worried that I couldn't have any new developments in the studio. She often said that as long as she could get a contract, she could wait for the opportunity to be in a better position in the film, and she didn't care about the amount of money.

### Crickets

— Su Ming

Autumn has truly arrived. The cicada's song in the willow trees has been scattered without a trace by the gusts of autumn wind, replaced by the orchestra of crickets. Yong-er has always had a fondness for crickets. In the days before school started, he was already searching for crickets in the corners of walls and in damp soil. As soon as he heard a "qu qu" sound, the cricket would certainly be invited by Yong-er to become a resident in his earthenware pot. Each day, he would be sure to get three meals of white rice and clear water, a much more luxurious life than eating mud under the soil. However, while enjoying these rights, Yong-er expected some obligations from it, which it was quite willing to fulfill. What were those obligations? Yong-er loved to act as a matchmaker for cricket fights. If he caught two, he would put them in the same pot to watch them gnash their teeth and fight for dominance. Hearing a triumphant "qu qu" sound would make Yong-er's heart bloom, he was happy beyond words. Sometimes, the cricket was very cunning and, catching him off guard, would jump and escape. This was not surprising, as it was born with a humble nature and did not deserve such a comfortable life. However, tears would inevitably well up in Yong-er's eyes as he bid it farewell, and he would scold it in his heart as an ungrateful beast.

Later, school started, but his attention to crickets did not diminish. One day, his older brother came over and said to him, "Don't just play with crickets and forget about preparing your lessons. Now is the season for crickets, and you can gain some knowledge about insects by observing them. Have you learned anything?"

"What? I don't understand what you're saying. Crickets are crickets, and insects are insects. What do they have to do with each other?" Yong-er said, shaking his head in surprise.

"You really don't understand. 'Insect' is not just one type of bug. It encompasses a very wide range. Crickets, ants, flies, mosquitoes... all belong to the insect category, and a cricket is just one type of insect.

Look at that cricket: it has a pair of antennae on its head, six legs, membranous wings, and a body divided into three parts: head, thorax, and abdomen. Its body has segmented rings, which are very hard and made of chitin. This is just the external morphology of a cricket, and it can also be said that all insects have it. It can even be said to be the basic structure of insects. If you don't believe me, you can catch a fly to prove it. These are the basic facts about insects that we must remember. Now, here's a fun thing to do with crickets: go catch a female cricket with a swollen abdomen, commonly called 'San Mi Zi', because the eggs inside her belly are fully developed. At the same time, take a wide-mouthed jar that is five inches deep, and fill it with two inches of soil. The soil should be dry and contain little decaying leaves, so that mold does not grow. Then gently shake the jar to fix the soil so it is easy for her to lay eggs. Put the female cricket in the jar and feed her with eggplant slices. Pay attention to her at all times. Later, you will see that the female has three spines on her rear end, the middle one being the ovipositor. She will insert it into the soil to lay eggs. Eventually, the female will die. Remove her and the eggplant slices together. Then, put a lid on the jar, but not too tightly. It is best to separate the lid with a piece of cardboard. Place the jar in a corner of the house, away from direct sunlight. Wait until early June of next year to see if any baby crickets hatch. Isn't that a very interesting thing to do?" After hearing this, Yong-er, of course, went to try it out.

### The Spirit of Forgiveness of Jesus Christ (1)

Most people think that when a person is suffering, he only thinks about his own pain and has no time to think about others. In fact, when a person is suffering, if he only thinks about his own suffering, he will become more and more bitter, and will blame heaven and others, feeling that others are treating him unfairly, and that there is no justice in the world.

What was Jesus' state of mind when he was on the cross? This is what we all want to know. If Jesus had remained silent on the cross, we would have no way of knowing. Even if we speculated, we would only assume that he was the same as ordinary people, full of resentment, so-called dying with injustice. Fortunately, the authors of the four Gospels have preserved for us the seven sayings of Jesus on the cross, allowing us to know Jesus' state of mind. What is most amazing and admirable is that the first sentence he said was open and honest. He did not resent anyone, he did not reproach anyone, nor did he regret that his years of work had resulted in such an outcome. Instead, he said a sentence full of love and compassion: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." (Luke 23:34) We can discuss this quote from Jesus in three points:

(1) Jesus practiced his own teachings: Jesus once taught people, "Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you..." (Luke 6:27/29) He taught people in this way, and he practiced it in this way. The common problem of people is that they only know how to teach others, but do not know how to teach themselves. Jesus gave us a good example, which is "say what you mean, and mean what you say." Because we should not only be good at teaching others, but also often teach ourselves. Those who cannot teach themselves can never teach others, and will never have the ability to move people. Jesus' prayer did not set any limits as to who could be forgiven and who could not be forgiven. He prayed for all his enemies, Judah who betrayed him, and the Roman soldiers who nailed him, all were included in the forgiveness. Not only the enemies of that day, but also those who are now hostile to him, can equally receive forgiveness. May I ask how universal the scope of forgiveness is? (To be continued on the 11th)

Readers who want to know the details, please send a letter to the Literary Evangelism Society at 351 Avenue Edward VII, Shanghai, and you will receive a detailed reply.

### Impressions of Listening to the Radio

— Jun Mei

High-end consumption means enjoying visual and auditory pleasures to the fullest. Forgoing visual pleasures and only listening to the radio is actually not the worst inexpensive way to pass time. Under this principle, I have become best friends with my radio. However, in the process of listening, I have unintentionally discovered many terrible things.

Recently, a storyteller, in broadcasting an advertisement for a bookstore, introduced a novel called "XX Anecdotes of Romance and the Unusual." He said: "This novel narrates romantic and unusual events in Sichuan. Women in Sichuan embrace polyandry, men and women have freedom of marriage, and women only take one bath every three years." I have no way of knowing the content of this novel, but at least what this storyteller reported in these tidbits is absurd. Sichuan is now the location of the temporary capital. It is not the mysterious Sichuan that people thought it was a few decades ago. The improvement of cultural standards is a matter of course. Even compared to the decadent and licentious isolated island of today, it cannot be compared. This almost defamatory promotion may be a deliberate temptation by the advertising staff, but the storyteller did not carefully consider the impact of the words he introduced. This really deserves attention.

Secondly, a ballad singer, in broadcasting an advertisement for coal briquettes, in addition to stating the advantages and disadvantages of the coal briquettes' firepower, the ballad singer loudly proclaimed that the price would rise immediately, for example, "Today it is six yuan and eight jiao, and the day after tomorrow it will definitely rise to seven yuan and two jiao." Therefore, he shouted loudly: "Listeners may want to hoard some." Moreover, if listeners "do not have a place to store it, they can store the coal briquettes with the store, and if they do not use them, they can sell them on your behalf when the price rises." This seems a bit like training listeners to learn how to hoard and speculate. Today, the wind of speculation on the isolated island is rising from the ashes, stirring up trouble in the air. This is also unacceptable.

Furthermore, when a storyteller of heroes spoke of Fang Guozhen's surrender to the Ming Dynasty, he said: "Fang Guozhen is a great man who can bend and stretch, a hero who knows the times." Therefore, he cited the dangers of war, leading to the conclusion that continuous warfare "only causes the people to be displaced and suffer pain." These few words made people feel jarring to hear.

Originally, it is only right not to deeply blame broadcasting performers for having occasional minor errors, such as slips of the tongue, etc., in the condition of lacking restraints in speaking, but errors like those mentioned above will absolutely not be unavoidable. It is hoped that broadcasting performers will correct their errors if they exist, and strive to improve if there are none, so as not to give others an excuse to criticize.

### The National Federation Grand Theater Opens After the Mid-Autumn Festival

— Luo Cun

If all readers are not forgetful, they must still remember the news that the "Palace" on Yu Qiaqing Road would be rebuilt into a second-run national film theater not long ago. But now it has been decided to change it into a first-run theater and rename it "National Federation." According to reliable sources, there are two reasons why the National Federation wants to change to a first-run theater:

First, the contract that Xinhua signed with Jincheng has now expired. Jincheng has enough to cope with the productions of Guohua and Guotai recently, and may even show new films from "Jin Xing", so it will no longer renew the contract with Xinhua. In addition, Xinguang already has a large number of Huaxin productions, and it also has to take time out to show productions from Yihua Hezhong, etc., so it is also overwhelmed. Huguang also has films from Huacheng and Yihua, and also shows second-run Western films, so these two theaters no longer have room for Xinhua to intervene. Seeing this, the National Federation wants to take over the productions of Xinhua, and if there is time, it can show the backlog of new films from Yihua.

Second, the "National Federation" is in a very moderate location, with convenient transportation. There are only the Da Shanghai and Da Guangming Western film theaters on the left and right, and it is also located between Xinguang and Huguang, forming a three-legged stand, so it also has considerable confidence in business.

The reconstruction of the "National Federation" will be completed, and according to the person in charge, it has been decided to open after the Mid-Autumn Festival. The first film to be shown will be Xinhua's "Country Girl", starring Yuan Meiyun and directed and co-starring Wang Yin.

Now is the time when fashion films are on the rise. Using this "dark horse film" as the opening film in the new theater will undoubtedly cause a sensation.

### The Da Shanghai Theater's Sale Has Complications

This publication reported on the 5th on the news of the sale of the Da Shanghai Theater. According to the investigation, the inside story is slightly complicated. Yan Youxiang of the Yi Company had already made up his mind on this matter, but he was the initiator in name, and the nature of the matter was joint investment. After several months of negotiations, there was a breakthrough on the 4th. Both parties agreed to pay 10% of the deposit at 3:00 pm on the 5th, and the handover would take place one month later. Unexpectedly, Yan only paid the money at 4:30 pm. The theater said that the agreed time had passed, and another celebrity had also paid the full amount. The two parties competed for the theater, and as a result, neither party was able to settle the matter. Negotiations are still underway these days, and a decision will be made soon.

The Adventures of Hawsang

Chapter 6: A Dangerous Experience

Lu Jiansheng's eyes moved to Hawsang and me. Hawsang's eyes were not only half-closed, but completely closed. I also felt that this guy's arrogance was unbearable, so I deliberately looked away. When I looked back, I saw that not only Ni Jinshou was embarrassed, but even Lu Jiansheng seemed to be in a difficult situation.

Lu Jiansheng said, "Hawsang is a private detective, isn't he? Then, I can bear this cost, as long as you solve the case quickly."

Hawsang slowly opened his eyes. "Lu Jiansheng! How much are you planning to pay?"

"This—this—you must have a certain amount. Just say how much, and I'll pay it."

"That's unfortunate. I haven't set a fixed fee. Usually, when I investigate cases for people, I never accept rewards—hey, is your Hua Da Bank solely owned or a company?"

"What—what do you mean by that!" His tone was a little annoyed.

Hawsang still said slowly, "I'm telling you, if your bank is a joint-stock company, you're just a manager, then you're not qualified to say that boastful thing. If it's solely owned, then I have to ask you, how much assets do you have in total? Because since you want to use the power of money to drive people, then I have to check whether your money is enough to pay me."

The power in Lu Jiansheng's eyes changed a little. He seemed about to explode, but he was suppressed by Hawsang's calm demeanor, and he couldn't explode. He raised his right hand and put the already extinguished cigar to his mouth, taking a few puffs. He looked at Ni Jinshou. Ni Jinshou lowered his head, clearly not knowing how to deal with it.

Lu Jiansheng said falteringly, "What—what is this? Are you joking with me?" (100)
