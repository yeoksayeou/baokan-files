### Germany's Plan to Invade England Inevitably Doomed to Fail: Observations by American Figures

Washington – Chairman Bloom of the House Foreign Affairs Committee told the press today that Germany's plan to invade England is bound to fail. He stated that there is no doubt that Britain will be able to resist Germany's blitzkrieg strategy. Mr. Bloom predicted that Britain will be able to resist Germany until victory is achieved. He said that the conquest of Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France was not due to Germany's military strength, but rather to the result of the "Fifth Column's cunning schemes." Britain has already recognized this danger and has taken all possible steps to destroy the activities of the Fifth Column. Britain is now united and prepared for war with Germany. Bloom further pointed out that as long as the British Navy possesses naval supremacy, Germany's plan to invade England will become even more difficult. (United Press Dispatch, 13th)

### Axis Powers Arrange a New Formation: Large-Scale Attack on England Not Far Off; Situation in the Balkans Fully Clarified; Italian Newspaper Claims British Mediterranean Traffic Cut Off

Zurich – According to a telegram from a correspondent in Rome for a certain newspaper here, the Axis powers' attack on Britain and the British Empire will likely begin within four or five days, as the recent Munich Conference has fully clarified the situation in Southeastern Europe, deeming it no longer necessary to delay. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)

Rome – The official "International Relations Report" published a lengthy article stating that Britain's day of reckoning will occur within weeks. Countries are now exhibiting a tendency toward a new front, which should be carefully studied, as a simple diplomatic strategy can attempt to evade the responsibilities that will inevitably be placed upon those countries at the time of negotiation. Whether France adopts a Fascist system or a non-Fascist system, its serious responsibility for provoking war by attacking the Axis powers cannot be relieved. The reality of the European situation is now controlled by the aspirations of the Italians and Germans, and guided by one idea: the bloc of Fascism and National Socialism. Spain occupies a position in this bloc, and Hungary is a loyal friend of the Axis powers, and it is not its fault that its legitimate demands have not been resolved in a spirit of goodwill. What can now be determined is that a genuine new balance of power must be established in the Balkans. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)

Rome – Renowned Italian journalist Gayda wrote in yesterday's "Italian Daily" that even if Britain dispatches over a hundred warships to the Mediterranean, the Italian Navy has already cut off communication between Britain and its colonies and has threatened British traffic in the eastern and western Mediterranean. Britain can no longer obtain supplies from the Balkans or the Near East. (United Press Dispatch, 13th)

German Aircraft Air Raids Expand Scope Over England Compared to Before

London – German aircraft that have been intensely bombing England for days have today expanded their bombing range to Scotland and Wales. This action appears to be in preparation for implementing their blitzkrieg tactics against England, and some people predict that Germany's attack on England may erupt next week. At dawn this morning, a German aircraft bomb fell on a certain village in Wales, but there were no casualties. Searchlights shone upon the arrival of these iron crows, and one German aircraft quickly dropped seven bombs. This was evidently a hasty release due to British fighter planes taking to the air to pursue the enemy. Yesterday, German aircraft intensely bombed the entire territory of England, and continued their work last night and this morning. The southeast, southwest, and northeast parts of Scotland were separately bombed with bombs and incendiary bombs. The number of casualties and the extent of damage are not yet known. This morning, German aircraft dropped 24 fierce bombs and 100 incendiary bombs on a certain village in the northeast, but no casualties have been reported. At the same time, the bombing of a certain town in Wales at dawn today resulted in one death and two injuries. Another town was hit by two bombs, with no casualties. Furthermore, hundreds of firefighters are currently engaged in extinguishing a major fire caused by an air raid in southeastern London. (United Press Dispatch, 13th)

London – The Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Home Security issued a communiqué this morning stating that last night, enemy aircraft dropped bombs in England, Scotland, and a small area in the northeast of Wales, destroying some houses. Although several people died, the casualties were not many. Also, one enemy aircraft flew over a certain area in southwestern Scotland, and three bombs fell on residential areas, injuring several people. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)

Berlin – A communiqué from the German High Command stated that German bombers attacked ships off the coast of England and in the Channel, and also bombed airfields, ports, and arsenals in England and Scotland, sinking one patrol boat and one merchant ship, and heavily damaging five merchant ships. Yesterday, the enemy lost thirteen aircraft, and five German aircraft went missing. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)

Italian Air Force Takes Offensive Against British Ships in the Mediterranean

Rome – According to a war report from the Italian Military Headquarters, after enemy ships were bombed on the 11th, they sailed eastward in five groups. The Italian Air Force departed from various bases to pursue and attack them, and has hit at least two cruisers and one battleship. When Italian reconnaissance planes patrolled Malta, they engaged in fierce combat with four enemy destroyers, shooting down two enemy aircraft. All Italian aircraft flew back to their bases. An Italian torpedo boat was sunk by enemy bombing, but all sailors were rescued. In East Africa, Italian forces occupied a British village near Moyale. Italian aircraft shot down four enemy aircraft. Enemy aircraft attacked Kisimayo, Jijiga, and Massawa, but were shot down by an Italian destroyer and an anti-aircraft battery. All Italian aircraft flew back, and one Italian aircraft, which was reported missing yesterday, has also returned. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)

Rome – Yesterday, the Italian Air Force launched a large-scale offensive, intending to eliminate the British fleet in the Mediterranean and destroy British bases along the Mediterranean. Semi-official sources said that the British Navy suffered heavy losses from Italian bombing, and several battleships are retreating toward Alexandria. Since the major battle between the British and Italian navies in the Ionian Sea in southeastern Italy, starting on Sunday, Italian aircraft, departing from numerous bases on Wednesday alone, burned one British aircraft carrier, destroyed two British destroyers, and sank one British merchant ship. Furthermore, according to a communiqué here, the Italian Air Force's recent attack was concentrated on one British destroyer, which was escorting the remaining four merchant ships that had departed from Malta. However, shortly thereafter, the British Admiralty completely denied all the aforementioned claims by Italy. (International Telegram, 13th)

Rome – According to the "Italian News," the British naval strength in the Mediterranean is as follows: seven heavy battleships, two aircraft carriers, ten cruisers, a total of seventy torpedo boats and destroyers, fifteen submarines, and many small boats. The newspaper stated that the British fleet in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea consists of seven light cruisers and twenty torpedo boats and destroyers. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)

Rome – The Italian Air Force continued to bomb the British naval base of Malta yesterday afternoon, dropping many bombs and incendiary bombs on the airfield. At that time, British destroyers took to the air to engage in battle, resulting in two being shot down by Italian aircraft. All Italian Air Force planes returned safely. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)

Editorial

### France Changes its Political System

Every year on this day, French citizens and friends of France are always excited and jubilant, celebrating the revolutionary anniversary of the French Republic, the National Day of founding the country.

This year on this day, France has only just begun to implement a dictatorial political system. The President of the Republic, Mr. Lebrun, has been removed from office, and the two houses of parliament have also been destined for the end of being dissolved and eliminated soon. General Pétain has been promoted from Prime Minister to Head of State, and assumes supreme power.

This is not only a change that is deeply regrettable, but what is somewhat comforting is that, although the French Revolution at that time did make great contributions to human civilization for a century and a half thereafter, drawing a new era in human history and becoming an extremely important and glorious page, and therefore becoming a world-historical achievement that transcends national borders, in short, its influence on future generations is particularly profound and far-reaching; however, this change in France is a passive following, an expedient response, and its impact on the future of France itself remains a question, and is not enough to affect any other country.

At the end of the 18th century, on July 14, 1789, the citizens of Paris angrily stormed and destroyed the Bastille prison, and since then the flames of revolution have risen high, overthrowing the Bourbon dynasty and adopting a republican system. This date is exactly one hundred and fifty-one years from this year. Historians argue that the significance of the French Revolution is not only the change in the national system of one country, but also (1) establishing a model of democratic politics, establishing the principle of popular sovereignty by universally granting suffrage to adult males. (2) Replacing the concept of a national organization of monarchical subjects with the expansion of civil rights, making national consciousness universally advanced. (3) Abolishing censorship of people's thoughts, getting rid of fetters, and making freedom of thought one of the basic human rights. (4) Stipulating in law the equality of believers of various religions, that is, guaranteeing freedom of belief by law. (5) Destroying the economic and commercial feudal system, allowing anyone the freedom and equality to choose a profession. What the French Revolution created and proclaimed is certainly not just these five bases; and for these five items, which are regarded as a matter of course by modern people; drinking water and thinking about the source, one cannot but attribute it to the achievements of the French Revolution, which is the beginning of modern civilized countries. For this reason, we cannot help but deeply yearn for the French Revolution of that year, and cannot help but deeply regret the political changes in France today.

After 1789, the French republican system was interrupted again and again; Napoleon conquered the east and west, made military achievements and reduced foreign enemies, and then claimed himself emperor; Louis XVIII restored the Bourbon dynasty with the strength of the international anti-French alliance; after that, there was Charles X, there was Louis Philippe; there was Napoleon III; all of them had fame and color, did things and accomplished things; in short, until 1870, the national system was repeatedly reversed. After stabilizing for seventy years, now that the war against Germany has failed, the situation is precarious, and General Pétain has resolutely adopted a dictatorship; although looking back on the events of seventy years ago, changing the system is not an exception, and the dictator head of state is of course different from the self-proclaimed imperial system, but the so-called democracy and the so-called freedom are almost impossible to see again.

According to what Head of State Pétain announced to the French people the night before last, he said that the government has huge tasks to be dealt with urgently; he also said that in the dark period when France was forced to submit to Germany, France's suffering was still continuing; he also said that this war has declared the collapse of international capitalism and international socialism, and France has now broken away from various dark treaties and alliances; but France will transform the French nation and the life of France alone with a brave and persevering spirit. All of these announcements are quite thought-provoking; moreover, recalling the recent telegrams, since Pétain and his ministers, during their leisure walks, often have wet tears and faces full of sorrow, such a situation is particularly sympathetic, but it is not enough to explain the necessary reason why France must change to a dictatorial system, nor is it enough to guarantee that the dictatorial system will be able to overcome the difficulties safely.

Former French Prime Minister Daladier was in power for many years, based on the majority party and expanding his power. When the situation on the Western Front became tense, he asked the parliament for greater power but could not get it, so he announced his resignation; we then questioned whether French people had not deeply believed in the dictatorial system. When Pétain came to power when the parliament was still there, with parliamentary power in hand, since the initial procedure for emerging and retiring had reached the usual practice, and using the Prime Minister to abolish the President, calling himself the Head of State, changing the political system, and creating a new constitution, the wind passed and the grass bent, and it seemed light to lift a heavy weight; we then questioned whether the essence of French democracy had long disappeared. For this reason, all those who care about France both hope that France will struggle hard and eventually achieve success, but also worry about the future disturbances caused by the further changes in the political system. It is difficult to predict the gains and losses, successes and failures of the future of the regime change, but judging from the fact that the democratic spirit of that country has long disappeared, I secretly believe that the successes and failures, gains and losses are not related to the political system; in other words, France's encounter with danger cannot be attributed to democratic politics. The world situation has changed dramatically, and people are frightened by the phenomena, mistakenly believing that the political system is short or long, and always want to imitate it. How is this different from tapping the pan and groping for the candle?

The first victory yesterday was achieved by six Hurricane British aircraft patrolling outside the coast of East Anglia in the early morning to protect merchant ships. Ten Henkel German aircraft came to attack merchant ships, and four of them were shot down by British aircraft. The remaining six failed to damage the ships and were driven away. After a while, two Dornier German aircraft attempted to attack the convoy, one of which was shot down by a British aircraft, and the other was also damaged.

### Japanese Volcano Erupts Again After Seventeen Years of Inactivity: 500 Hectares of Pasture Land at the Foot of Mount Osawa Covered with Lava

Tokyo – A dormant volcano on Miyake Island, 175 kilometers south of Tokyo, suddenly erupted last night. The Yokosuka Naval Station dispatched a seaplane to inspect the island's airspace at 5:00 AM this morning, arriving around 6:00 AM. According to the pilot's report, there was heavy rain, coupled with a strong wind with a speed of 20 meters per second, and dark clouds hung low. Hazy smoke emerged from the island, and lava flowed into the sea. He was unable to fly close to Mount Osawa, where the eruption occurred, but other parts of the island seemed normal. The naval station sent a warship and a minesweeper each at 8:00 PM this afternoon, carrying food and medical supplies to the island, which is expected to arrive around 1:00 PM this afternoon. A coastal ship of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha has been ordered by the company to sail to the island.

### Closing Remarks of the Seventh Plenary Session

Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Japan deeply understands this point and is apprehensive. What I mentioned above is merely a striking recent international example to illustrate the repercussions of Japan's actions. However, it is different for us in China. Because the China problem is the Asia problem, it is also a matter related to the safety of the entire world. It can be said that every country in the world hopes we can achieve victory. Everyone can see the newspapers of the Soviet Union and other friendly nations, which all published special articles on our "July 7th" anniversary of the War of Resistance, praising the great contribution of our country's three years of resistance and the significant relationship with friendly nations around the world. However, comrades, you must understand that the most important issue in increasing global sympathy lies entirely with ourselves. Only when we are self-reliant and strong can we be valued by friendly nations, and that is also our greatest guarantee of victory. Moreover, if we can truly be self-reliant, self-sufficient, then there will be no question about the victory of the War of Resistance. Everyone, consider how the emerging nations in the past decade or so have diligently governed and strived for self-improvement. It is evident that any nation, as long as it can be self-reliant and strong, can transform weakness into strength and danger into safety, no matter how adverse the environment. Otherwise, even with good conditions and advantages, it will inevitably fail to live up to its excellent innate qualities and ultimately perish. Absolutely no country in the world can exist by relying on external forces without being self-reliant, and no nation can survive by relying on external forces without being self-strengthening. We should focus on such aspects when observing the world situation and should also learn from the experiences of others and make extraordinary efforts. Regarding the diplomatic, military, political, and economic situations of the Japanese, I have already provided detailed explanations in the document I released on the anniversary of the July 7th War of Resistance. The Japanese are now not only completely trapped in a diplomatic dead end with no way out, but no one wants to ally with them, and no one will be intimidated by them. They are truly facing numerous difficulties, and the biggest problem is the issue of manpower. Japan's population is only one-sixth of ours. After the consumption of our three years of resistance, they have long felt extremely exhausted. Coupled with frequent domestic natural and man-made disasters, the Japanese have now truly reached a stage of exhaustion and are on the verge of final collapse. They still covet Annam and the South Seas, which is truly overestimating themselves. We can say that even if they occupy Annam and the South Seas, the result will only be to increase their troubles and accelerate their demise. What I find most comforting this time is that despite the scorching heat and the continuous bombings, the comrades attending the meeting have been so spirited and worked so hard, for eight days, from beginning to end, without any slackening. This is truly a sign that the final victory of our War of Resistance is inevitable. We revolutionaries should have this kind of spirit. Despite the continuous indiscriminate bombings by Japanese planes, even after they dropped such a large 1,000-pound bomb around this place at three o'clock today, we still held our meeting as usual at the bombing site at four o'clock, and no one was absent. This shows that our revolutionary spirit is indeed becoming stronger through adversity and more invigorated through hardship. In particular, the Japanese have launched indiscriminate bombings for more than two months now. Our people have suffered such cruel threats, but they are not afraid at all. They are only more calm and courageous, and everything is business as usual, burying themselves in work. It is truly as if nothing has happened. We also see the situation of children and young people singing and serving in air raid shelters, taking care of their parents and elders, which is even more endearing. Our compatriots are able to be so brave, calm, enduring, and resilient, which truly inspires and motivates us. After three years of such significant sacrifices by the military and civilians of the entire country, the social morale is becoming more and more courageous and resilient, which has become more firm over time. This effect can be said to be entirely due to the inspiration of our Premier's ideology, which also proves that our Three Principles of the People have deeply penetrated the hearts of the people of the entire country, so that compatriots across the country, regardless of men, women, old, or young, are becoming more and more enthusiastic every day, and the unity between the government and the people is becoming closer every day. With such a great revolutionary ideology and such an excellent national spirit, how should we, the central comrades who bear the responsibility of leadership, work together to live up to our Premier and be worthy of our compatriots across the country? Everyone must understand that after three years of bloody battles, we have truly gained unlimited confidence. If our nation, which is so tenacious and hardworking, cannot independently survive in the world, then which nation in the world can be independent and survive? Understanding the situation of the Japanese even more can allow us to realize that we are becoming stronger through fighting. The final victory of the War of Resistance will definitely be in our hands, comrades.

It must be noted that while the current situation is indeed beneficial to our War of Resistance, we should always prepare for the arrival of the most serious and difficult period. Because any career, especially the cause of revolutionary nation-building, will inevitably encounter the most difficult and arduous step as it approaches the final stage of success. This is a certain principle. For example, when we refine metal into pure steel, genuine steel cannot be refined unless the heat reaches the most intense and highest point. Therefore, if we want to win the War of Resistance and revive the nation, we must also go through this highest degree of difficulty before we can succeed. Just as before the sky dawns and day breaks, there must be a time of extreme darkness, and then infinite light will emerge from it. We must never say that because we have not encountered much difficulty in the three years of the War of Resistance, there will be no difficulties in the future. We should be sharpening our swords in time, preparing with the most perseverance and strength to overcome the extremely difficult period that is bound to come, overcome any obstacles, and break through any dangers, so that we can obtain the final victorious path to light. Our comrades must also know that our War of Resistance is entirely the strength of the Three Principles of the People, and our Party should take the initiative as a pioneer in taking risks and overcoming difficulties. From now on, the success or failure of the War of Resistance and the survival or demise of the nation are entirely the responsibility of our Party. Comrades, everyone should regard the life of the Party as their own life, and be determined to perish with the Party when it perishes, and survive with the Party when it survives. Entrust all personal safety, life, death, honor, disgrace, fortune, and misfortune to the Party, obey the Party's orders, and abide by the Party's discipline. As long as everyone can promote Party ethics, execute Party orders, and implement Party resolutions, then our country and nation will definitely be able to independently survive, and the War of Resistance and nation-building will definitely achieve final success. Especially the comrades who have come from afar this time, those who are responsible in various Party, government, and military aspects, should adhere to this spirit, work diligently and earnestly, and widely publicize the spirit and important resolutions of this meeting in the front and rear provinces and regions, inspire Party members, supervise subordinates, and mobilize compatriots to be of one heart and one mind, each performing their duties, and complete our War of Resistance and revolutionary work. Our three years of bloody battles in the past, with the sacrifice of countless comrades and compatriots, have laid this foundation for inevitable victory. We must remember the loyalty and bravery of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country, examine the great responsibility of those who survived, and intensify our efforts in the face of the current environment. Then our light and victory are at hand. We deeply hope that all Party comrades and compatriots across the country will work together and not hesitate to make sacrifices to complete the mission of revolutionary nation-building and achieve our goal of realizing the Three Principles of the People.

### Blockade of the Yunnan-Burma Road Cargo Transport Rumor of British Acceptance of Japanese Demands Craigie and Arita Allegedly Signed Agreement Prohibition of Military Equipment, Automobiles, etc. from Being Transported to China via Burma

Tokyo According to Asahi Shimbun, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and British Ambassador to Japan Craigie allegedly concluded an agreement on Friday regarding Britain's prohibition of military equipment and automobiles. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced yesterday that the negotiations between Foreign Minister Arita and the British Ambassador yesterday had made satisfactory progress. A detailed announcement regarding this matter is expected to be made public on Monday. Sources with inside information said that this agreement still needs the approval of the British government, but considering the instructions received from London by Craigie before his meeting with Arita on Friday, it is believed here that the agreement can be approved soon. Asahi Shimbun also stated that the Japanese government now intends to increase the personnel of the Japanese Consulate in Rangoon in order to closely inspect the nature and quantity of transportation on the Burma Road. The newspaper also stated that the Japanese government is very satisfied with the British government's previous reply regarding the transportation of goods to Hong Kong, as the British authorities stated that they would take measures to prohibit the transportation of munitions entering Chongqing via Hong Kong. (13th United Press report)

Tokyo It is heard that the British have now agreed to the Japanese demands regarding the Yunnan-Burma Road, but the details have not yet been resolved. Asahi Shimbun reported that British Ambassador Craigie notified Japanese Foreign Minister Arita yesterday afternoon that the British government had decided "basically and substantially" to accept the Japanese demand to stop the transportation of supplies and economic goods on the Burma Road to Chongqing. Arita then discussed with Craigie the types of goods to be stopped and the specific measures to be taken for two hours. As a result, the two sides reached a general agreement. After the talks, the British Ambassador telegraphed his government for instructions in order to obtain a formal understanding as soon as possible. Asahi Shimbun also stated that the materials to be prohibited will include weapons, ammunition, motor trucks, and gasoline. When necessary, officials from the Japanese Consulate in Rangoon will serve as inspectors. Therefore, the personnel of the Rangoon Consulate will be increased. The newspaper continued to say that the point about inspectors will not be included in the formal British-Japanese understanding. As for the Hong Kong route, it is heard that the Japanese government is satisfied with the British reply of July 8, which stated that the Hong Kong government authorities had taken measures to prohibit the transportation of military supplies to China to aid the Chongqing government. (13th Reuters report)

London It has recently been confirmed by reliable sources that regarding the British-Japanese agreement established by Britain in response to Japan's request to block the Yunnan-Burma Road, Britain has argued that this blockade should be limited to three months. (13th United Press report)

Tokyo The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman declared yesterday that Japan hopes that Britain can provide a satisfactory reply regarding the request to block traffic on the Yunnan-Burma Road. It is said that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie, when visiting the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, indicated that the British reply would be of this nature. (13th Haito News Agency report)

Chongqing According to reliable sources, the Chinese government has repeatedly notified the British government of its deep concern regarding the negotiations between Britain and Japan regarding the issue of transportation through Burma. Chinese officials attach importance to the fact that China has the right to demand that the Burmese roads should continue to be open for international transportation. From the perspective of the Chinese people, the Burmese roads were once one of the few international routes available to China, so the maintenance of this route is extremely important for the continuation of friendly relations between China and Britain. (13th report)

Chongqing According to a senior official of the National Government, the negotiations in Tokyo regarding transportation between Britain, Hong Kong, Burma, and China seem to have the appearance of a compromise with Japan. All sectors of the Chinese community are very surprised to hear this. Japan has no right to interfere in this. Britain, with regard to international public law, League of Nations resolutions, and the honor that great powers should enjoy, should refuse the demands made by Japan to close the routes. Britain has repeatedly stated that its foreign policy towards the Far East has not changed and that it will not take any action that would harm China. They believe that today's British cabinet will not repeat the great mistake made during the September 18 Incident. According to reliable sources, Japan, compelled by economic and other difficulties, has decided not to start conflicts with other countries. It is now only trying to show strength diplomatically in order to achieve its goals safely without encountering armed resistance. Chinese political circles hope to obtain reassuring news from the British side to clarify the situation and correct the mistaken impressions caused by the news from Tokyo. (13th Reuters report)

Hong Kong The British government has again instructed its ambassador to Japan, Craigie, to negotiate with Arita on the issue of prohibiting the transportation of goods to China via Hong Kong and Burma. The reasons held by Britain are: (1) The British government cannot prohibit legal trade between Burma, India, and China, and Japan has no right to demand a ban. (2) The British government has an obligation to abide by the resolutions passed by the League of Nations that member states should provide assistance to China separately. Therefore, it is difficult for Britain to comply with such a ban. However, the Japanese side is still dissatisfied and will threaten to intensify the blockade of Hong Kong. This was originally a step planned by the foreign ministry and the military department of the Japanese government to use both soft and hard tactics in an attempt to get Britain to comply with its demands. It is heard that the British government's attitude has recently been firm, and it is unwilling to destroy its position on its Far Eastern policy. (12th report)

British Ambassador to Japan Denies Rumors of Returning Home

Tokyo Rumors about the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, returning home have been formally denied by the British Embassy yesterday. (13th Haito News Agency report)

### US Explains Monroe Doctrine Chongqing Newspaper Criticizes Claims It's a Sign of Weakening Far East Policy

Chongqing Newspapers here have recently criticized US President Roosevelt's article "Asia for Asians," published by his secretary O'Leary, claiming that President Roosevelt's statement is a sign of the United States weakening its Far East policy.

Xinhua Daily

The Communist Party organ newspaper Xinhua Daily even claimed that the United States has abandoned its position of leadership in the world. The newspaper said that the collapse of France in Europe has given Japan a good opportunity and made it impossible for the United States to resolve the Sino-Japanese war through the Nine-Power Treaty. The newspaper also said that the US Navy is not stronger than the British, and the US Air Force is even weaker. Even after mobilization, the number of people recruited by the US Army in a month is only one-tenth of the German army. Even by July 1, 1941, the total number of US Army, Navy, and aircraft will be at most 6,000. The newspaper also made a harsh criticism, saying that even if the entire American people wholeheartedly expressed their opposition to the blockade of Japan, US scrap iron and gasoline are still being supplied to Japan in a continuous stream.

Shishi Xinbao

Shishi Xinbao stated that the Secretary of State is preparing to give a new interpretation of President Roosevelt's statement, which is indeed worthy of our attention. However, the remarks in the original statement involving Vietnam have already been undeniably made. In reality, the United States can no longer maintain the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty. It must be understood that the world is a whole group, and Asia is a part of the group. If the Asia problem cannot be resolved satisfactorily, then the whole world, including the Americas, cannot hope for safety. What is even more ridiculous is that Hull actually said that the United States has no intention of interfering in any Asian issues except for the Dutch East Indies, because the Dutch East Indies are the source of tin and rubber needed by the United States. May I ask, is the relationship between the United States and Japan only about tin and rubber? The United States' inability to tolerate Japan's acquisition of the Dutch East Indies is aimed at tin and rubber. Now the relationship between the United States and China is far greater than the mere tin and rubber. Can the United States tolerate Japan conquering China? If Japan conquers all of Asia, its threat to the United States will be greater than Germany conquering all of Europe. It must be understood that the Soviet Union's competition is not only to protect its own territory, but also to protect small and weak countries. Only with this kind of method can aggression be stopped. Therefore, the United States should also adopt the same attitude as the Soviet Union. British Prime Minister Chamberlain and former French Prime Minister Daladier have rashly sacrificed many small and weak countries and brought disaster to their own countries. The lessons of the past are a warning. I hope that the intelligent Americans will not repeat the mistakes. (13th United Press report)

All measures we are currently taking to ensure national security and the welfare of the people are progressing without difficulty. The people of Turkey are also fulfilling their duties with a joyful trust and generous spirit. Those who wish to influence Turkey must first know that Turkey is no longer the dead Ottoman Empire of the past. The advancement or retreat of Turkish politicians can only be determined and agreed upon by the Turkish Parliament. Those who are currently in charge of Turkish affairs have only one aim, which is the safety of the Turkish Republic. At the same time, we also encourage friendships that are suitable for Turkey's interests and security. Turkey does not betray its friendships, nor does it neglect its independence and freedom. We are now united, calmly awaiting developments. We do not want to provoke or attack neighboring countries, and we are deeply gratified to see that neighboring countries share the same sentiment. If there is any action that endangers Turkey's independence or its territorial integrity, then the only answer the Turkish people will give is to take up arms to defend the country until death. Although the world situation is unstable, it seems that our country is not in imminent danger. We are still governed by the desire to maintain good relations with all countries, especially neighboring countries. In the past few days, one incident that has drawn our attention is that a certain foreign organization has published various documents, some of which involve Turkey, and some newspapers have also published these documents and propaganda based on them. The question of the authenticity of these documents cannot disturb the Turkish government or the public, because we firmly believe in the correctness of our policies and understand that any propaganda only proves the correctness of Turkey's policies. We have only one way to deal with those who criticize Turkey based on such documents and attempt to prevent Turkish politicians from implementing their policies, and that is to ignore them. After the Prime Minister finished speaking, the Parliament unanimously voted to trust the government. Many diplomatic personnel were present during the Prime Minister's speech, including the British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent recently obtained information from responsible sources here, stating that the public is very satisfied with Turkish Prime Minister Saydam's speech yesterday, because he clearly stated that Turkey is fully aware of the divisive provocations by the Germans in the Balkans.

### The U.S. Strengthens Air and Sea Defenses, Prepares to Mobilize the National Guard, the Army and Navy Sign Unprecedented Manufacturing Contracts, and the Two-Ocean Fleet Program Begins to Be Implemented

Washington: The Navy Department yesterday signed the largest manufacturing contract in history. This is the result of President Roosevelt's statement that he is considering mobilizing the National Guard for further training. The Navy Department signed a contract worth US$136,743,000 to enhance the nation's air defenses and shipping facilities on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. This contract is part of the administration's plan to build 35,000 aircraft for the Army and Navy by July 1, 1942. At the same time, the Army Department signed a contract worth US$46,197,000 yesterday to purchase various important equipment. President Roosevelt told reporters that his proposal to mobilize the National Guard is a new step to strengthen national defense. The President's statement was in response to Army Chief of Staff Marshall's recommendation to the Senate Military Affairs Committee. Marshall suggested that the Senate Military Affairs Committee implement a slightly modified conscription bill to replace the "Burke-Wadsworth" bill currently under discussion in Congress. Marshall's bill would require all men in the country from the ages of 18 to 65 to register. He stated that if this bill is implemented, the Army will need another 350,000 men by September, in addition to the 400,000 National Guard troops. General Marshall also stated that once the National Guard is expanded to 400,000 men, they will undergo one year of rigorous training in accordance with the conscription law. If this conscription law is implemented, the Army will immediately conscript 300,000 to 400,000 men and conscript the same number next April. He also announced that by October 1941, the Army Department hopes to conscript an additional 600,000 men, bringing the total number of new recruits to between 1.2 million and 1.41 million. The current authorized strength of the regular army is 280,000 men, but it is widely believed that the conscription law is now in progress so that it can reach 375,000, which is the number specifically approved by Congress. (United Press dispatch from the 13th)

Washington: President Roosevelt told reporters that the U.S. National Guard will undergo a partial mobilization in the near future for training purposes, but only if Congress approves this plan. Roosevelt has discussed the details with the new Secretary of War, Stimson. According to reliable sources, a portion of the National Guard will be mobilized, including anti-aircraft artillery units and harbor defense units. The official announcement regarding the duration of service has not yet been released, but those close to the Army Department stated that the term is approximately one year. In addition to general military training, training on the use of modern weapons will also be conducted simultaneously. People here believe that the U.S. government's plan is a preparatory step for adopting a compulsory military training system. (Haitong dispatch from the 13th)

Washington: The U.S. Navy Department has recently ordered warships worth a total of $137,000,000, breaking the record for peacetime shipbuilding. This is part of the U.S. program to build a two-ocean fleet in the Pacific and Atlantic. U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall also told the Senate Military Affairs Committee today that if the U.S. regular army and National Guard are to be increased to a sufficient strength, it is necessary to implement compulsory military training immediately. An Army Department official also told the committee that if Congress enacts a military training bill, the Army will have 930,000 men in training by October 1, and this number could increase to 1,415,000 by next April. (Reuters dispatch from the 12th)

Washington: According to an announcement by the Army Department, the establishment of the Ninth "Streamlined" Division is the final step to be implemented according to the current plan. Countless other new units will also be organized. It is expected that the strength of the standing army will increase by 55,000 men, so it is possible to engage in this effort.

### Germany Will Publicly Challenge the Pan-American Conference

Washington: Government officials here announced last night that they have gathered some evidence that German representatives will publicly challenge the "Monroe Doctrine" at this month's Havana Conference of American Republics. Officials here believe that the "warnings" issued to several Latin American countries may be a prelude to Germany's intensified efforts to disrupt the Western Hemisphere when the Havana Conference convenes (the "warnings" stated that Germany hopes they will advocate neutrality favorable to Germany at the conference). Officials here have also received intelligence that German representatives may use force in Havana, as they did at the First Conference of American Republics in Panama City last month on the ninth. The representatives at the Havana Conference will discuss the economic and territorial issues in the Western Hemisphere caused by the European war. (United Press dispatch from the 13th)

### Who Won the Mexican Election? Camacho Received the Most Votes, Almazán Claims to Have Been Elected

Mexico City: A strange situation has occurred in the Mexican presidential election. According to the vote count, Camacho received the vast majority of the votes in the country, but his opponent, General Almazán, claims that he is the victor. According to custom, the official election results will be announced on September 11 in the House of Representatives, but newspapers are now forced to publish notices stating that General Almazán believes that he has been legally elected and intends to establish his own congress. It has been confirmed that representatives have been issued. The advertisement also stated that the congress will convene in a place to be announced later to declare General Almazán as president, and then he will be sworn in, and Camacho's party will not be allowed to take any action in the formal legislature. What is concerning now is that if President Cárdenas cannot resolve this matter, the old turmoil in Mexico will occur again. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)

### The Chicago Convention Will Begin Tomorrow, Roosevelt Declares He Will Not Attend, But Refuses to State His Attitude on Re-election

Washington: President Roosevelt declared yesterday that he would not personally attend the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next week, but he again refused to state his attitude on a third term. The Democratic convention will be held in Chicago on Monday, but the first few days will be routine speeches and the announcement of the party platform. The formal vote to elect a presidential candidate to oppose Republican candidate Willkie will not be held until Thursday. Political observers last night still expressed doubts about the President's true intentions. If the President once declares that he will relinquish his right to be elected, it will cause a reaction from countless hopeful presidential candidates in Chicago, because they do not want to compete with President Roosevelt, and will indefinitely suspend their campaigns. (United Press dispatch from the 13th)

Chicago: Democratic officials reported last night that Senator Byrnes of South Carolina and Secretary of Commerce Hopkins, after arriving here from Washington yesterday, have begun to prepare everything to involve the President in the campaign and make him the third master of the White House. Mr. Hopkins moved into the Blackstone Hotel, which is the hub for communication between the convention and the White House. Mr. Byrnes is staying at the Stevens Hotel across the street. According to reports, he will preside over all matters related to the third term. Hopkins and Byrnes stated that President Roosevelt will not comment on re-election unless the convention formally elects the President as a candidate. It is believed here that since the President announced that he would not attend the convention, the re-election campaign is trying to avoid any suspicion of directly taking orders from the President by telephone. However, it is rumored here that Hopkins and Byrnes have absolute authority to represent the President. At the same time, Senator Wheeler of Montana told 800 cheering Chicago businessmen last night that the Democratic platform must include not dragging the United States into the vortex of war, and the convention delegates must also elect a strong candidate in order to "implement the platform." He stated that he fears that the United States is "heading down the path of 1917, but at a faster and more dangerous pace." Senator Wheeler stated that the only task facing the United States at present is to maintain a democratic policy in the Americas and solve its own economic problems. The most important economic problem is to increase mass consumption, so that farmers and employees have the opportunity to purchase various necessary and luxury goods. (United Press dispatch from the 13th)

Washington: When President Roosevelt met with reporters today, he firmly stated that he would not go to Chicago to attend the Democratic convention. When reporters asked what his intentions would be if he were elected to a third term as president, President Roosevelt avoided answering this question and went on to say that he was planning to discuss the mobilization of the National Guard with Secretary of War Stimson today. If President Roosevelt is indeed a candidate, his only competitors in the Democratic nomination will be Vice President Garner or Postmaster General Farley, but it is widely believed that these two have very little hope of competing with President Roosevelt. Isolationist Senator Wheeler, who had threatened to form another "Peace Party," has also issued a statement saying that he will support the candidate nominated by the party and there is no question of organizing a third party. If President Roosevelt refuses to accept the Democratic nomination for a third term as president, the Chicago convention will become a place of chaos and party strife. At present, it is generally believed that the convention's nomination of President Roosevelt is almost certain. If he agrees to accept it, the main focus of the convention will be the nomination of the vice president and the drafting of the party platform. As for the vice presidential candidate, it will be either a strong supporter of the New Deal or a Southern Democrat. If the latter is elected, it will unite the conservatives of the party. If a supporter of the New Deal is elected, then the rumor that the president may resign after the world crisis has passed, so that the vice president can succeed to the White House, will be more credible. The nomination of Secretary of State Hull as a candidate for vice president would be welcomed by Southern Democrats. If a person who supports the New Deal is chosen, then Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Douglas has the loudest voice. (Reuters dispatch from the 12th)

Washington: Although President Roosevelt will not go to Chicago to attend the Democratic National Convention, no one doubts that the convention is under his control. President Roosevelt will remotely control everything in Washington. President Roosevelt will be a politician in political history who keeps the secret of his will to run for a third term, but on the eve of the opening of the convention, it was finally revealed with a hint. If President Roosevelt refuses to run for election now, it will be a huge disaster for the Democratic Party and throw its campaign into chaos. Failure in the election in November may be inevitable. President Roosevelt has not even hinted at his will to his family, which has caused other presidential hopefuls in the Democratic Party to lose their chance to compete. Therefore, the leaders gathered in Chicago feel slightly uneasy and need to make an announcement to indicate that Roosevelt intends to run for re-election in order to boost the morale of the entire party and prevent the competitive Republicans from gaining an advantage. President Roosevelt's recent remarks on the Monroe Doctrine, regardless of the isolationist Senator Wheeler's leadership, may be a torpedo in the possible third "Peace" Party. President Roosevelt also recently made a vow not to send troops to Europe. This has caused all efforts by Republicans to attach the label of warmonger to Roosevelt to fail. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)

### Anti-American Movement Occurs in Taipei, U.S. Considers Withdrawing Consulate Staff

Tokyo: It was learned here last night that an anti-American demonstration occurred in Taipei, Taiwan Island, last week. The incident was triggered by the detention of Matsuo, a secretary at the U.S. Consulate, and a dispute arose between the U.S. and Japan. Matsuo has been working at the U.S. Consulate for 22 years. A few weeks ago, he was arrested for investigating the number of registered cars in Taiwan with the local Japanese authorities. It is said that this information was included in the routine consular report submitted to Washington. Although Matsuo did not obtain the car information, he was sentenced to three years in prison for violating military secrets. The State Department has repeatedly protested to the Japanese government, but has not been able to get this case reconsidered. If Japan continues its current attitude, the United States will be prepared to consider withdrawing the staff of the U.S. Consulate in Taipei. Since Matsuo's arrest, the U.S. Consulate in Taipei has stopped issuing passports, health certificates, and consular export certificates to Japanese ships sailing from Taiwan to the United States. Japanese ships are subject to fines upon arrival in the United States without these documents. An anti-American demonstration occurred there last week. When the public marched past the U.S. Consulate, they shouted slogans cursing the U.S. Consul Warner. It is said that the United States attaches great importance to this incident, because if the same incident occurs in Japanese territory, it will intimidate Japanese employees and hinder the daily work of the U.S. Consulate staff.

### A Letter from an American Reporter Reveals the Reasons for France's Defeat, The Retreat Without a Fight at the Meuse River Was a Fatal Blow, Laval Strongly Opposed the Idea of ​​Relocating the Capital Overseas

New York: A letter was received here yesterday from an American reporter, which vividly described how the German mechanized forces caused the French army to be defeated, and how Laval, now the Deputy Prime Minister of France, prevented the French government from relocating to North Africa. From the time the German army crossed the Meuse River to the time France and Germany concluded the armistice agreement, the reporter witnessed it all. The letter is recorded as follows: "The sudden defeat of the French army is indeed a very shocking event, but looking back on the past, I have realized that Hitler may have already known that the French army could not defeat the powerful German army. The turning point was when the German army crossed the Meuse River. The achievement of the so-called 'encirclement battle' was not only surprising to the French, but also to the Germans themselves. The German army did not regard this kind of 'encirclement battle' as the main war. Its purpose was to force the French army to send back its troops fighting in Belgium, with the clear intention of breaking through the defenses there (referring to the Meuse River). The German army only used half a mechanized division to attack the Meuse River defense troops, totaling 6,000 soldiers, 200 tanks, and 1,500 other vehicles. At that time, the German army seemed to be only testing the military strength of the area. Upon reaching the river, they found that the French army had abandoned all the intact bridges and retreated. So the German army ordered the tanks to cross the bridge and widen the bridgehead. Twelve hours later, although British pilots bombed the bridges on the river, it was too late, because the French army had already retreated, and the German army could build pontoon bridges over the river. At this time, the situation took a sharp turn, and the German tanks immediately drove towards Laon and Soissons. The reporter was in a certain army headquarters at the time and heard rumors that the German army had broken through the French defenses. Although it was generally acknowledged that the two French divisions defending the Meuse River line were very poor, and most of them were Parisians, no one believed that the German army could break through the defenses. (Note: Half of the two French divisions were busy working in the fields and in sugar factories in the rear.) Afterwards, it should have been easier to prevent the advance of the German motorized teams on the Somme River, but most of the war equipment was lost when retreating from Belgium, so that there was a shortage of military fire and guns. Shooting tanks with Lebel rifles and machine guns is like shooting sharks with blunt bows and arrows. How can it be effective? The scene of the French government relocating the capital was also very puzzling. Among the politicians who advocated first moving to Tours and then to Bordeaux, Laval was the main figure. At that time, other people advocated moving to Africa, but Laval alone thought it was impossible and still wanted the French government to stay in France. Laval, who has long been known to advocate French-Italian cooperation, then summoned members of the Senate and House of Representatives to see President Lebrun. At that time, Laval's words and actions could control everything. Laval pointed out that he believed that once the leaders of France left, the result would be that tens of millions of French people would be controlled by the Germans, and their lives and deaths would be determined by the Germans. Laval's argument was effective, and many government officials were more convinced that it was reasonable to stay in France. Laval also warned the cabinet members that he would never leave France, and after the war, Laval also advocated that the parliament punish all the members who fled, because at that time, 25 members had left France."

### On the Eve of the Democratic National Convention in America, Roosevelt's Attitude is Subtle

Have the changes in Europe over the past few months dispelled President Roosevelt's unwillingness to run for a third term? What is the effect of President Roosevelt remaining silent on the issue of a third term until the eve of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago?

If Roosevelt decides to run, it will not be due to the persuasion of his close associates, but rather because of his political opponents. This attitude has had two effects: he has prevented the "tycoons" of the major city party branches from supporting party chairman Farley (the current Postmaster General), and he has prevented the reactionaries within the Democratic Party from raising their heads. In other words, Roosevelt has made preparations that allow him to advance or retreat freely.

Farley's announcement that he would participate in the nomination race was, from his perspective, a bizarre adventure. His decision to challenge Roosevelt suggests that he was confident of a considerable chance of being elected. However, he is likely mistaken in some respects. This is because he is blinded by his position. The control that he enjoys over the party branches as party chairman will be lost invisibly when he uses it for his own benefit instead of for the benefit of the true leader.

Roosevelt has made it clear that he does not object to Farley or anyone else participating in the election, but that no one can use the party apparatus for their own convenience.

The so-called "tycoons" of the district party branches are people like Edward Kelly of Chicago and Frank Hague of Jersey City. It is very interesting that they are warning Farley and the reactionaries in the party by prioritizing public opinion over the party branch. The tycoons of the district party branches were originally in control of everything, rather than relying on others. The fact that they accepted public opinion, rose up to support Roosevelt, and opposed Farley shows where the authority within the Democratic Party lies. The success of this struggle was also proven in the Wisconsin and Illinois primaries, where the delegates unanimously supported Roosevelt and opposed Farley and Vice President Garner.

Now that Roosevelt has completed these preparations, he knows that his policies will be continued by someone. If he finally announces his retirement, America's strength in international relations will not be adversely affected. He may even be able to control the Democratic National Convention and decide on a successor, in other words, ensure that a New Deal proponent, rather than a conservative from the South or an isolationist from the Midwest, is elected.

This choice of candidate was originally waiting to see who the Republican Party would nominate for president. According to the original plan, if the Republican Party nominated New York District Attorney Dewey, then the Democratic Party would compete with him using Secretary of the Interior Ickes or New York Mayor LaGuardia. If the Republican Party nominated Senators Taft or Vandenberg, then the Democratic Party was prepared to oppose them with Senator Wallace. Now that the Republican Party has put forward a "Dark Horse," Willkie, the Democratic Party's original plan will inevitably be overturned.

In short, the American election situation still depends on whether the international situation is more important than domestic affairs. At present, as Secretary of State Hull said, American domestic affairs cannot compare to the international situation. President Roosevelt also has great power in his hands, and his "yes or no" truly carries immense weight.

President Roosevelt

Postmaster General Farley

Vice President Garner

### The Cost of the European War

According to British Chancellor of the Exchequer Hore-Belisha's announcement in Parliament, Britain's daily military expenditure is £7.5 million, which is equivalent to US$28,125,000, or approximately 46,875,000 Chinese legal tender. According to American reports, 250 German planes bombed Paris, killing 254 people and dropping 2,060 bombs, worth approximately US$265,000. Sixteen planes were shot down, worth approximately US$2.5 million. Dividing this among the 254 dead, each person gets US$10,840.

### British Children

The British government is in contact with the various dominions to evacuate 20,000 children to safe locations, with 10,000 planned to be sent to Canada, 5,000 to Australia, and the rest to New Zealand and South Africa. Although their parents will not accompany them, they will be escorted by warships across the vast ocean, how tragic and magnificent!

### Guangdong Provincial Department of Education Subsidizes Meal Expenses for Middle School Students and Provides Relief to Families in War Zones Unable to Support Themselves

(Shaoguan Airmail) In view of the rising cost of living, the Guangdong Provincial Government believes that it is urgent to increase the subsidies for meal expenses of middle school students withdrawn from war zones in order to maintain their studies. Therefore, the Department of Education has proposed a revision of the "Provisional Measures for Subsidizing Meal Expenses for War Zone Students in Guangdong Province Middle Schools," which was passed and implemented by the Provincial Council. The main points are as follows: (1) Any middle school student whose family is in a war zone and whose source of income has been cut off, and who has been duly proven to require relief, may apply to the school for a subsidy. However, students receiving public funding or students who have been held back in the current semester are not eligible to apply. (2) The meal subsidy is divided into two amounts: full amount and half amount. The full amount is 9 yuan in national currency per month, and the half amount is 4.5 yuan in national currency per month. (3) Students may apply for a meal subsidy once per semester. (4) The school principal should select several faculty and staff members to form a committee to subsidize student meal expenses to review the eligibility of students applying for meal subsidies. The school will then prepare four copies of the budget and two copies of the student meal expense request form, along with the stamp, and submit them for verification. The full semester's meal expenses will be issued in one lump sum and distributed by the school. (5) The number of students requesting full and half subsidies should, in principle, each account for one-third of the total number of students withdrawn from the war zone. (6) The student meal subsidy is issued in two installments each year: the first installment is from January to July, and the second installment is from August to December. (7) Students whose school registration has not been confirmed are not eligible for a meal subsidy. However, if the school's reporting procedures have not been completed, resulting in the student's school registration not being verified in a timely manner, the meal subsidy may still be issued at the school's request for the sake of providing prompt relief. However, if the student's school registration is found to be non-compliant and should be removed, the school will be responsible for returning the meal subsidy that has been received in full. (8) The meal subsidy for provincial schools is provided by the Department of Education. The meal subsidy for county, municipal, or district schools is, in principle, provided by the county or municipal government. The Department of Education may provide subsidies at its discretion when necessary. (9) If a student receiving a meal subsidy receives financial support from their family, the subsidy should be stopped immediately.

### Guangdong Department of Education Plans to Establish a Wartime Art Museum

As for the 50 trainees recommended for training in the first phase, they will be selected by the Department of Education's various working teams and public secondary schools and above. Those interested in art work will be admitted to the museum for training, and each political working team established by the political organs may also recommend trainees for training. Each trainee will pay miscellaneous fees of 2 yuan per month. The museum will provide accommodation, while meal expenses and all other expenses will be borne by the original recommending organization.

The Student Relief Committee organized by the Shanghai Chinese Christian YMCA held a registration for poor students to help poor students in colleges and above, and senior high schools.

The examination was held on the afternoon of the 8th of this month at 7:00 pm. According to Miss Fei, the clerk of the association, the results of the registration examination were expected to be announced in the near future. However, due to the large number of candidates and the fact that the examination papers are still being reviewed by the committee, and the registration examination of this session is not based on the test of excellence, but also the family conditions of each student must be investigated to determine whether they are truly poor. The investigation will take time, so the announcement will be postponed to the 25th of this month.

In yesterday's Hezhong Cup charity basketball game, the A1 group Paramount played against Qunyi.

### Newspaper Frankly Discusses Peace, Acknowledges Chinese Fighting Strength, Subtly Explains the Advantages and Disadvantages of Sino-Japanese Peace and War, and Knows that Partial Peace is of No Avail

The Sino-Japanese war has been going on for three years. Looking back on the past, we will try to compare the attitudes of both China and Japan towards the war, measure their psychology, and log the facts. This is indeed a meaningful and interesting matter. Since Japan launched its war of aggression against China, it initially shouted wildly about "conquering China in three months," and then claimed a "hundred-year war." In the meantime, there were also arrogant words such as "must fight until China kneels." The sound of gnashing teeth was almost audible. However, in the past six months, what has been heard has changed to "ending the war against China." Looking back at China, "resisting to the end," only these four characters have remained unchanged, ringing and sonorous. The secret here is not difficult to discern. Recently, the Japanese side has become increasingly tired and its desire for peace has become more urgent. At first, it was still hesitant and secretive, but now it has become increasingly frank. The English-language newspaper "Hong Kong News" published by the Japanese in Hong Kong published an article on June 30 that revealed the desire for peace. As soon as this article came out, it attracted great attention from Chinese and foreign people. One point in particular, with skillful wording, directly admitted that negotiating peace with a certain party would not help "Sino-Japanese cooperation." This is indeed a public and frank confession from the Japanese side. In this anxious and hesitant state of the Japanese side, the number of wins and losses is very clear. Where should China go from here? There is no need to say more. The general summary of the "Hong Kong News" article is as follows:

Empty Talk About Victory and Defeat

Chongqing politicians have many misunderstandings about the peace that Nanjing and Tokyo are about to begin negotiating. They believe that the restoration of Sino-Japanese peace relations is a matter of shame and must be avoided. This "stupid" view is due to their failure to understand the truth. There is no war that lasts forever. The result of all wars must be peace. In the war between the Chongqing government and Japan, it has indeed been "defeated," but this is by no means a stain on China's glorious history, because since there is war, there must be either defeat or victory.

Subtle Words

War is like a large-scale sports meeting. Victory or defeat is not worth emphasizing. What is needed is that the loser can maintain its sportsmanship. The past is gone, and the future can be pursued. We should not let the mistakes of the past hinder the development of the future. It is time for the Chongqing authorities to recognize the facts.

Praising the Chinese Army

Sino-Japanese peace is the only way to save China. Being defeated does not mean being weak. The Chinese people and their war power have no bad characteristics. If they can restore "reason" at this time, it is not too late to mend the fence after the sheep are lost. We should take this war as a valuable experience and continue to move forward along this path.

Praying for Cooperation

Indeed, if Japan's war goal is to conquer China, then Chongqing should continue to resist. However, Japan has repeatedly stated its upright and bright goals. Konoe has assured China that the Japanese side will never regard itself as a conqueror. Under Konoe's principles, peace will never harm China's "independence." The Chinese people will still enjoy "freedom." However, if the Japanese side suggests that Chongqing "does not participate," then China will still be "divided." China's "division" will not help Sino-Japanese cooperation at all. Japan does not want a "divided" China.

### Today is French National Day, Ceremonies Suspended, Only Flags are Hung to Celebrate, Passed in Solemnity

Today is the anniversary of the French Democratic Republic. The French expatriates in Shanghai are in a very different situation this year than in previous years. There will be no extravagance. Only flags will be hung to celebrate. Even the lanterns in front of the embassy, consulates, and various patrol rooms have been cancelled without any formal announcement. Therefore, today's National Day commemoration will be passed in solemnity and silence. It is rumored that French Ambassador Cosme and his wife will host a garden party at their private residence on Hague Road. The French Embassy, the French Consulate General, the French Municipal Council, the French Police Department, etc. will all be closed for one day today. However, today happens to be Sunday and it is closed as usual. Tomorrow will be a make-up holiday and will be open as usual on Tuesday.

Every year on the 14th of July, the French National Day, the French Concession Police Department has the practice of promoting and rewarding detectives and staff of all levels, including Chinese, French, Vietnamese, and Russian, who have worked diligently and achieved excellent results. On this year's National Day commemoration, it was found that Zheng Detective Liu Kunbao, Mao Jinsheng, and Chen Shunbao have served for many years and have made excellent contributions, and they were promoted to inspectors. In addition, Deputy Detectives Guo Shaorong, Zhang Chunsheng, Wang Dongwan, Cheng Wangming, Zhang Fengming, and Wang Wenwei have worked diligently and are commendable, and they were each promoted to Zheng Detective. Detectives Weng Huanzhang and Qi Deqing were promoted to Deputy Detectives to show encouragement.

### Incident of Japanese Military Police Detained: Baker Visited Miura Yesterday, It is widely believed that the United States and Japan will issue a joint statement

According to the English-language "Evening Post," Colonel Baker, the commander of the Fourth Regiment of the United States Marine Corps, visited Major General Miura Saburo, the commander of the Japanese Military Police in Shanghai, yesterday to discuss the incident on the "July 7th" anniversary in which U.S. Marines detained sixteen Japanese plainclothes armed soldiers in the defense zone. It is widely believed that Japan and the United States will soon issue a joint statement on this matter. According to a Japanese newspaper, the Japanese authorities were deeply dissatisfied with Colonel Baker's response to Commander Miura some days ago. On the mornings of the 11th and 12th, they twice dispatched Lieutenant Colonel Utsunomiya and Major Hayashi to the U.S. Marine Corps authorities to explain the situation at the time and the Japanese attitude in detail. Regarding the resolution of the incident, the Japanese side insisted that the U.S. Marine Corps authorities should acknowledge their mistake and offer a sincere apology. As for the Japanese residents in Shanghai, they seized the opportunity to stir up anti-American sentiment, clamoring incessantly, with the intention of demanding that the U.S. Marine Corps withdraw from Shanghai.

U.S. Soldiers Prohibited from Wearing Plain Clothes

Furthermore, Colonel Baker issued an order yesterday morning, prohibiting all soldiers under his command from wearing plain clothes. This order took effect last night. Violators of this order will be severely punished. The U.S. commander stated that the issuance of this order was because American soldiers, when going out for entertainment in plain clothes, were often mistaken for bank managers or senior executives of foreign firms. However, observers here believe that the issuance of this order by the U.S. commander at a time when Japanese plainclothes soldiers were detained by the U.S. military and the Japanese side was expressing dissatisfaction was no coincidence. Colonel Baker issued this order to avoid or prevent possible retaliation from the Japanese side.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Plans to Improve the Rickshaw Industry Situation

The Shanghai Municipal Council believes that the rickshaw industry in the city has recently reached an unsatisfactory state. A special committee has been organized to implement a temporary relief measure. This measure allows rickshaw owners to increase the daily rental fee by 15 cents, from 83 cents to 98 cents, while the Shanghai Municipal Council will increase its subsidy to the mutual aid society by 50 cents per rickshaw per month to support the welfare of rickshaw pullers. According to statistics, there are currently 9,500 rickshaws in the International Settlement and 5,000 in the French Concession, totaling 14,500. With an average of four rickshaw pullers per rickshaw, there are approximately 58,000 rickshaw pullers in the two concessions. Including their families, more than 100,000 people depend on rickshaws for a living. Their income is insufficient to cover their expenses, and their livelihoods are facing great difficulties.

### China-France Airmail Route Suddenly Suspended Yesterday; British Royal Airmail Resumes Flights to Australia and South Africa; Pan American Airways Undertakes to Forward Mail to Europe

The British Imperial Airways Limited (I.A.L.) suddenly ordered a suspension of flights on June 13 due to the war situation. The Shanghai Post Office was ordered to refuse to accept mail transported by British Imperial Airways aircraft. All airmail destined for various parts of the United Kingdom was rerouted via China-France Airlines to Marseille, and then transferred by ship to London and other parts of the United Kingdom. After the clash between the China-France fleets in Oran Harbour, which strained relations between the two sides, the China-France route continued to operate as usual, but most British and American merchants preferred to have their airmail to the United Kingdom routed through the United States. After repeated consultations with Pan American Airways by the Shanghai Postal Administration and the Kunming Postal General Bureau,

Pan American Airmail is Stable, Fast, and Convenient

The Hong Kong-San Francisco route operated by Pan American Airways is used to transport mail to the United States, and then the company's Atlantic mail route is used to transport it to various European countries. This has been implemented since the 6th of this month. According to inquiries by this newspaper's reporter, airmail delivered via the above route takes about 15 days to reach Europe. The airmail fee is 5.40 yuan per 5 grams. However, it must be noted on the envelope "(By P.A.A. Service Via U.S.A.)".

British Imperial Airways Resumes Mail to Certain Destinations

The Shanghai Post Office yesterday received an urgent telegram from the Postal General Bureau stating that the British Imperial Airways route has resumed mail service to Australia and the Union of South Africa. Subsequently, airmail destined for Australia, the Union of South Africa, the Gold Coast, Kenya, Mozambique, Portuguese East Africa, Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, and South Africa, transported by British Imperial Airways and Qantas aircraft, will be accepted again from today. Flights will still depart from Hong Kong. The airmail fee for letters to Australia is 1.30 yuan per 5 grams, and for letters to various parts of South Africa, in addition to the normal letter fee, the airmail fee is 3.40 yuan per 5 grams. As for various parts of Europe, service has not yet resumed and mail will still be routed through the United States. The Post Office has issued Notice No. 1615.

China-France Hanoi Route Temporarily Suspended

It is also learned that the Shanghai Post Office yesterday received a telegram from Hanoi notifying them that the China-France air route (A. ) is temporarily suspended. Therefore, the Post Office has suspended accepting mail from yesterday destined for Hong Kong, Hanoi, or via the Hanoi-Marseille route to various European countries and French territories. Currently, the only airmail route available for mail destined for Singapore, Siam, India, and Bombay is KLM (K.L.M.).

Pan American Exclusively Handles Airmail to Europe

According to the North-China Daily News, yesterday (the 12th) the authorities at the Shanghai Post Office stated that with the suspension of flights by British Imperial Airways and KLM, and the uncertain situation of Air France, airmail destined for Europe via the westward route may be completely suspended. KLM suspended flights last Saturday. As for the situation with Air France, the Post Office is awaiting a reply telegram from Hanoi. However, all westward routes have been temporarily suspended. Airmail sent from Shanghai can still be transported to Europe via Pan American Airways' trans-Atlantic air route, taking approximately 15 days to reach its destination.

Sea Defense Postal Service Has Resumed

After a temporary interruption of the sea defense shipping route, the Shanghai Post Office sent lightweight mail destined for Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Shanxi (western part), Shaanxi, Gansu, and areas to the west, Zheng County and areas to the south and west, and Yichang and areas to the west, via Jinhua, Ji'an, and Weiyang. Now that the sea defense route between Shanghai and Haiphong has resumed since the 13th, all mail destined for the above areas will, for convenience, still be routed via Haiphong and Kunming.

### Establishment of Special Wartime Customs Stations to Protect Resources - Decided by the Economic Warfare Department

In order to strengthen economic administrative efficiency and adapt to the needs of the long-term war of resistance, it has been decided to establish an Economic Warfare Department. It has also been decided to establish special wartime customs stations everywhere from Suiyuan in the north to Guangxi in the south, to complete a "Great Wall of Economic Defense" over 3,000 miles long, in order to prevent the dumping of Japanese goods into the interior and to prevent the smuggling of materials out of the country. The nature of this department is similar to that of the British wartime economic department. It is jointly composed of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Military Law Department of the Military Affairs Commission, and will be in contact with the military commanders of various guerrilla areas to strictly inspect the entry and exit of goods and prevent the plunder of Chinese resources.

### Police Commissioner Bowen Goes to Weihaiwei for Vacation

Major Bowen, the Commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Police, has requested a six-week leave of absence from the authorities to go to Beidaihe to escape the summer heat. It is understood that he has been approved by his superiors. Commissioner Bowen has purchased a ticket on the SS Shengjing from Butterfield & Swire. The SS Shengjing was detained by the Japanese at Wusongkou for carrying munitions. Commissioner Bowen will first go to Weihaiwei for vacation. During his absence, his duties will be temporarily assumed by Deputy Police Commissioner Smith.

At 2:30 p.m., the Jianghai Customs removed the black balls from the Bund rooftop and the Yangshupu signal station, and shipping was officially released. Around 2:00 p.m., as the hurricane began to sweep past east Shanghai, the wind intensified. The wind force was six outside Wusongkou, and approximately three to four within the city. After 4:00 p.m., the wind stabilized. The civilian boats sheltering from the wind at Lujiazui successively returned to their original berths and resumed normal activities.

### Strict Prohibition of Rice Merchants from Mixing Inferior Goods - Regulations on the Marked Price of Foreign Rice - Rice from Ping County Also Being Shipped

The Rice Price Evaluation Committee held its second evaluation committee meeting the day before yesterday, assessing the highest price of foreign rice at 61.50 yuan, approximately 2 yuan lower than the previous assessment. This has been announced and implemented in the market since yesterday morning. All transactions among market traders must not exceed the price limit. Any instances of secret dealings should be reported to the authorities of the two settlements for punishment. Subsequently, the marked price of all foreign rice is only allowed to increase by 1.50 yuan compared to the price assessed by the Rice Price Evaluation Committee. However, there are still those who mix inferior goods into high-quality rice in an attempt to make a large profit and deceive the public. The authorities have repeatedly issued orders to crack down on this. It is understood that if such incidents occur again, they will be severely punished. It is also understood that the 20,000 bags of foreign rice ordered by the Ping County Committee are already being shipped and are expected to arrive in port around the 20th.

### Japanese Troops Along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Install Electric Fences - Already Installed in the Changzhou Section - Great Loss of Crops

A person from Wuxi reported that the day before yesterday at 10:00 a.m., a mobile unit of over 200 men came from the direction of Taihu Lake in the southern district of Wuxi, in the Fangqiao and Banqiao areas, and opened fire at the Ruotang Bridge with the Mei Mingzhang unit of the Nanqiao puppet self-defense corps. The two sides clashed for four hours, and there were casualties on both sides. Currently, along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, the Japanese side, fearing damage from the mobile units, has decided to install iron wire electric fences along both sides of the railway for a distance of 60 meters. Within the electric fence, due to the danger of electric current, rice paddies can no longer be planted, and the planting of tall plants is prohibited, fearing that the mobile units will use the shade of rice, wheat, and mulberry trees to carry out sabotage. Both sides of the railway must be clearly visible. The electric fence has already been installed in the Changzhou section. Work will begin soon from Wangting to Wumu in Wuxi. Residents have no solution for what crops to plant on the land lost within the electric fence. Furthermore, residents within 5 kilometers of the railway, even children over the age of five, must obtain a "County Resident Certificate," otherwise they will not be allowed to reside there.

### French Concession Warns All Shops - Prohibiting Price Increases

### "Special Police" for Road Extension Outside the Settlement - Rumored to be Established Next Month - The Puppet Side to Establish a "Preparatory Committee" Tomorrow - A Large Number of Chinese, British, and Japanese Police Officers to be Incorporated

The negotiations for road extension outside the settlement have been ongoing for almost a year since their beginning. Throughout this period, the situation has been constantly changing, depending on the Japanese side's attitude, which changes with the times. For example, the establishment of the "Special Police" has been announced several times. However, due to the negotiations over the Land Office files in the past two months, the Japanese and puppet authorities have shelved the almost completed "Special Police" as a means of blackmail, and it seemed to be fading away. Subsequently, the Shanghai Municipal Council implemented a "pacification policy" on the Land Office files and "handed them over" to the puppet side on July 4. The puppet side believes that the relationship between them and the Shanghai Municipal Council is gradually becoming "clear," so the negotiations for the organization of the "Special Police" in West Shanghai have been revived. It is heard that recently, after several negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the puppet side, the situation is gradually taking shape, and it is scheduled to establish a "Preparatory Committee" tomorrow (the 15th) to begin preparatory work. In the future, the "Director" of this "Special Police Department" will be recommended by the puppet side. It is rumored that the puppet side has internally appointed Pan Da to take on this role. The candidates for the "Preparatory Committee" have also been designated. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Council will incorporate more than 280 Chinese, British, and Japanese police officers into the "Special Police." According to the puppet side, if the negotiations proceed smoothly in the future, it can be formally established by August 1.

### French Police Officers Rewarded for Service

On July 11, the French Police Department decided to award bronze medals to the following meritorious personnel in recognition of their achievements: (1) Russian police officer Sakharov, on June 25, 1940, while on duty, spotted a thug committing a crime and running away with a gun. The police officer bravely pursued and arrested him. During the pursuit, both sides exchanged fire, and the criminal was shot several times before being captured. (2) Chinese police officer No. 730, on June 25, 1940, while on duty in front of 118 Rue du Père Robert, suddenly heard gunshots inside a public bus. He immediately pursued the criminal in a vehicle. During the pursuit, both sides exchanged fire, and the criminal was shot several times before being captured. (3) Chinese police officer No. 302, on June 25, 1940, while patrolling Rue du Père Robert, suddenly heard gunshots inside a public bus. He tracked down the criminal and bravely pursued him. During the pursuit, both sides exchanged fire, and the criminal was shot several times before being captured. This officer was also awarded a second-class medal by the Shanghai Municipal Council for his brave actions.

### Japanese and French Police Jointly Search Wireless Radio Room - Inspect Radio Equipment and Leave Without Taking Anything

According to the English-language North China Daily News, the French Police Department, at the request of the Japanese authorities, dispatched police officers along with some Japanese military police to a Chinese wireless radio room at 67 Route Tenant de la Tour at 7:00 a.m. this morning (the 13th) to inspect the various wireless radio equipment. They then left without taking anything. However, it is widely believed that the Japanese authorities oppose the existence of this wireless radio room because they suspect it is under the jurisdiction of the Chinese government.

### Shaoxing and Xiaoshan Relief Society to Hold a Fundraising Conference Today - Ping County Fundraising Committee to Launch Entertainment Program to Raise Donations

The Shaoxing and Xiaoshan Relief Society is scheduled to hold its second fundraising conference at 3:00 p.m. today at the Shaoxing Association Hall at 330 Avenue Edward VII, hoping that enthusiastic people will actively participate. Furthermore, according to Mr. Zhu Chengxun, a committee member of the society, to the Pingming News Agency, the Ping County Donation Fundraising Committee is scheduled to convene a conference in the near future to pass fundraising measures. The measures are determined to be inviting famous Shanghai opera and Cantonese opera performers to perform, and holding painting and calligraphy exhibitions and charity sales. He also stated that recently, due to the severe rice shortage in Shaoxing and Xiaoshan, local celebrities have come to Shanghai to escape the disaster. However, these people, after escaping the disaster to Shanghai, have mostly not given any assistance to their suffering fellow villagers. He deeply hopes that these people will be enlightened and generously donate. Regarding the Relief Society's relief for the 500,000 starving people in the impoverished classes, if calculated at 6 yuan per person, it would require 18 million yuan for six months, which would be difficult. Therefore, it is planned to appeal to all sectors of the country for assistance. The Relief Society hopes that all sectors will donate large quantities of epidemic prevention medicines, as the situation with epidemics in Shaoxing and Xiaoshan, with cases of cholera, typhoid fever, and other diseases, is as high as 50 cases per week.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Prohibits Employees of Belligerent Countries from Taking Long Leave - Only Allowed to Travel in the Far East

This morning, a spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council stated that the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities continue to prohibit employees of belligerent countries from taking long leave.

The spokesman continued that the above-mentioned employees are only allowed to take leave to travel in the Far East. The authorities only reimburse the cost of travel to Japan. The Shanghai Municipal Council authorities have not attempted to allow employees to take leave to travel to Australia, Canada, or the United States. However, some employees believe that the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities will consider this issue in the near future.

Holroyd, the Deputy Secretary General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Miller, the director of the information department of the French Embassy, Mr. Sardicjia of Reuters, and lawyer Zhang Li were all present.

### Japanese Ship Daishan Maru Intercepted by Chinese Troops - Many Japanese and Puppet Personnel Arrested

### French Plane Crashes in Guangzhou Bay - Rumored to Have Been Shot Down by Japanese Military - Japanese Inspector and French Military Officer Both Killed - Shanghai Japanese Authorities Claim Bad Weather

According to the North China Daily News, the French authorities in Shanghai received reliable information last night (the 12th) that a French Airlines mail plane, which was specially chartered to transport a Japanese inspector from Hanoi to Guangzhou Bay on the 7th of this month, was shot down by a Japanese military aircraft while flying over the island of Hainan, occupied by the Japanese military, and crashed somewhere near the island. It is heard that fire was also opened on the plane from Hainan Island. Two well-known French military officers from Shanghai were on board, one being Captain Bocard, a director of the Hon Gai Coal Company, and the other being Lieutenant Testard, the godson of Mr. Flourens, the head of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Shanghai French Concession Police Department. What is remarkable is that Lieutenant Testard was born in Guangzhou Bay, left the bay several years ago, and this was his first return to the area.

Unexpected Disaster

In addition to the above two and a Japanese inspector, it is widely believed that the pilot, mechanic, and wireless operator of the plane have also died. The information received in Shanghai about this tragedy is unclear. However, it is heard that the plane was flying in fog, lost its way, and unintentionally flew over Hainan Island, where it was immediately fired upon from the ground. A Japanese aircraft also took off to pursue it. The French aircraft was hit and crashed. The wreckage has not been found. According to reports, Bocard previously resided in Hong Kong and occasionally came to Shanghai. Upon the outbreak of the war, he enlisted in the French army and became a captain. His brother is the head of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council. Testard was born in Guangzhou Bay in 1912. His biological father served as the Customs Commissioner of the Shanghai Jianghai Customs in 1914, but abandoned his post and joined the army when World War I broke out, serving as a pilot. He was later killed in the French Champagne aerial battle. Furthermore, the Shanghai Times reported that Lieutenant Testard was born on May 20, 1912, and graduated from the French Saint-Cyr Military Academy in 1933. In 1936, he was assigned to serve in the French army stationed in Vietnam. Moreover, the English-language North China Daily News reported that the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai this morning (the 13th) refused to comment on the report that a French mail plane was shot down by a Japanese fighter plane over Hainan Island. It was stated that without receiving official information from Hainan Island, they could not comment on the matter. So far, the information circulating in Shanghai is contradictory. One account stated that the misfortune occurred when

Bad Weather

Another account did not mention this point. A Japanese official said that he did not believe the French plane would be shot down by a Japanese aircraft, and that it was likely that the French plane was forced to land due to bad weather and was damaged. However, the French authorities in Shanghai stated that the message released by the Japanese side yesterday (the 12th) was a "formal and complete" message.

### Li Yuying's Sudden Death Case: Prosecutor's Office Investigated Yesterday, Obvious Doubts About the Cause of Death, Both Defendants Released on Bail for Further Review

Li Shizhen, a frail old man from Fupingtan, residing at No. 74, Lane 41, Route Doumer, had a daughter named Li Yuzhen, also known as Jieru, who was 31 years old this year. She worked as a nurse at Xiehe Hospital. In 1933, she was hired by the Sino-Western Sanatorium at No. 536 Xiaoshi Road as the head nurse, initially earning a monthly salary of 60 yuan, which was later increased to 300 yuan due to her diligent service. Because she supported a family of eight, she was determined to remain single and had saved over ten thousand yuan in cash and jewelry. Since she started working at the sanatorium, all her meals and accommodation were provided by the sanatorium. On the Dragon Boat Festival, June 10th of this year, she went home in the evening to visit her family and returned to the sanatorium to sleep. The next morning, around 10 a.m., her nephew, Li Konglan (17 years old), came to the sanatorium to get an injection from her. When he knocked on the door, there was no response. Therefore, Lu Zhenqing (from Beiping, 39 years old this year), the sanatorium's business manager and son of the sanatorium's director Lu Zhong'an, used a key to open the door and enter the room. He discovered that Li Yuying was lying stiff on the bed, her body cold. Lu immediately ordered Li Konglan to go home and report the news, but he did not report it to the police station according to the regulations of the concession hospital. Later, he ordered the sanatorium's doctor, Lin Zhengliang (38 years old, from Ningbo), to issue a certificate stating that Li Yuying had died of apoplexy. He then notified the Haig Road Chinese Funeral Home to collect and casket the body, and the coffin was temporarily placed in the funeral home. They had found a burial plot at the Hongqiao Cemetery and were planning to choose a date for burial when a person named Lei Huayun sent letters to the French Concession Police Department, the Second Special District Court, and the Fujian Fellow Villagers Association, secretly reporting that Li Yuying had died suddenly under unclear circumstances and requesting them to uphold justice and thoroughly investigate the matter to seek justice for the deceased. After receiving the letter, the French Concession Police Department sent detectives to investigate the Sino-Western Sanatorium and the Chinese Funeral Home, but found no conclusive evidence. They then ordered the police station to transport the coffin to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy and reported it to the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special District Court, which commissioned Prosecutor Zhao Changmin to open the coffin and examine the body.

Because the body had already undergone surgery by the funeral home, and the skin and flesh of the whole body were tight and hard, the exact cause of death could not be determined. However, Lu Zhenqing was suspected of concealing the sudden death and not reporting it to the police station, and Lin Zhengliang was suspected of issuing a certificate without authorization. The detectives were ordered to take Lu and Lin back to the police station for investigation before further review. Details of the case were previously reported. Yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Zhao of the Second Special District Court convened the relevant parties to the Criminal Court No. 2 for interrogation and investigation. According to the deceased's father, Li Shizhen, my daughter had always been healthy. When she parted with her family on the Dragon Boat Festival, she was still laughing and talking happily.

There was nothing unusual.

Unexpectedly, she died suddenly that night. According to my grandson Li Konglan, who witnessed it, my daughter's death was characterized by her hands being clenched and straight, bent as if resisting, her face was cyanotic, there were traces of blood on her lips, she was wearing a vest, and her lower body was exposed, but the quilt was neatly arranged, clearly indicating a sudden death. He also requested that lawyers Zhuang Dingxun and Li Zhongdao be appointed to represent him in court and requested the court to return his daughter's estate, including 8,700 yuan in cash, four gold bracelets, one gold ring, over thirty silver dollars, three fountain pens, one gold chain, one watch, a radio, one camera, seven large and small leather suitcases, four leather garments, over two hundred pieces of clothing, and one ton of coal, five dan of rice, etc. The court interrogated the two defendants separately. First, Lu Zhenqing testified that he and the deceased had always had a good relationship. On the night of her death, he advised her to go to bed early and did not know what disease she died of. He originally intended to perform an autopsy, but the deceased's family was very superstitious and firmly refused, so he did not perform an autopsy. Later, he ordered Doctor Lin to issue a certificate stating that the deceased died of apoplexy to avoid trouble. He was evasive in his other testimonies. Then, Lin Zhengliang testified that he was unaware of the facts and was ordered by Lu Zhenqing to issue the certificate. Because Lu was also a doctor and had already examined the body and determined that she had apoplexy, he signed the certificate as instructed, and he was unaware of anything else. At this point, Li Shizhen reiterated to the court that his whole family had never signed the certificate, nor did he ask Lu to issue it. The funeral arrangements at the Chinese Funeral Home were also made solely by Lu. To date, the funeral expenses of 1,540.42 yuan, the coffin storage fee of 624 yuan, and the alcohol expenses of 20 yuan at the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home have not been paid and should be Lu's responsibility. After the court summoned Li Konglan to testify about what he had witnessed, the court decided to postpone the investigation. Lu Zhenqing was released on bail with 1,000 yuan in cash and a business guarantor, and Lin Zhengliang was released on bail with 800 yuan in cash and a written business guarantor. If they could not provide bail, they would be detained. The court informed both parties that the Prosecutor's Office had the authority to handle the case according to the law and would not be lenient. Other criminal matters could be referred to the administrative authorities for investigation.

### Western Shanghai Area: Hotbed of Vice, All Entertainment and Dance Venues Use Gambling as Bait

Since the Incident, western Shanghai has become a special area. Gambling dens are everywhere. Although it has been repeatedly rumored that they will all be closed down, they are still openly operating as usual. Not only are these large-scale venues ubiquitous, such as Hollywood, Zhaofeng, Yuyuan, Qiuyuan, and Rongsheng gambling dens, which have recently changed their signs and continue to operate, luring people into their traps. Even the entertainment and dance venues in the area all use gambling as bait. For example, Yuyuantai at No. 1051 Yuyuan Road, Wilder, Midnight Garden, WilderCom, and more than a dozen small dance halls along Yuyuan Road are ostensibly for dancing and entertainment, but in reality, they all have poker games inside, luring tourists into the game to profit from them, causing great harm. Westerners call this area the "Monte Carlo of Shanghai," which is very accurate.

### Nanjing Road Ciyong Lane: Major Fire Yesterday Morning, Houses Destroyed, Significant Losses

On the ground floor of Building No. 4, Ciyong Lane, No. 450 Nanjing Road, Public Concession, were located the Yi Ji and Rong Kang medicinal materials shops. The upper floors were occupied by the Xia De and Pu Bao firms. At 5:30 a.m. yesterday, a sudden fire broke out in the Xia De and Pu Bao firms on the upper floors. Because the pu bao (reed mats) were flammable, the fire quickly spread. At the same time, the medicinal materials stacked on the ground floor were even more flammable, so the fire became uncontrollable. The flames soared into the sky. After receiving the news, the Central Fire Brigade rushed to the scene, but the fire had already spread to the neighboring buildings at No. 6, Qingsheng, Hongda, and Tongkang, three cotton cloth shops. Fortunately, the weather was hot, and the residents had already gotten up, so no one was injured. As a result, the fire was extinguished at around 7:30 a.m. Nos. 4 and 6 were completely destroyed. The losses were said to be substantial. Afterwards, the police took the source of the fire to the police station to investigate the cause of the fire.

### Failing to Repay Debt, Pushing to Death

Min Zhengren, a 40-year-old man from Suzhou, lived at No. 4, Tongle Lane, Route Poncet, French Concession. His brother-in-law, Pan Wulong, 64 years old, came to Shanghai from Suzhou two years ago to escape the chaos and stayed with Min. Min was in financial straits and often borrowed money from Pan to supplement his household expenses. Over the years, the amount was quite large. At 8:40 p.m. yesterday, Pan asked Min to repay the loan. Min not only refused to repay but also resorted to violence, pushing Pan with force. Because Pan was old and unsteady on his feet, he fell to the ground by the window, shattering the glass window. A piece of broken glass pierced Pan's abdomen, and he bled profusely. His family rushed him to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but he died before reaching the hospital due to excessive blood loss.

### Social News

Raided Drug Den

He was detained by the store owner, and Fang was arrested and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, charged with embezzlement. Both defendants admitted that they were confused at the time and did not deny secretly collecting customer payments for personal use. They appointed lawyers Wang Heng and Gu to defend them. After Judge Liao interrogated them, the court decided to postpone the hearing to the 20th. Both defendants were returned to custody.

Also, a boy named Wang Didi, five years old, was abandoned by his parents on the street and was taken to the Second Special District Court by the patrol police to request disposal. After Judge Yuan Xiaogen briefly questioned them, he ordered that both children be handed over to the China Children's Welfare Association for care.

Beware of Pickpockets

To Whom It May Concern, on the 10th of this month, I was riding the French Business Route 22 bus when my leather bag was stolen, containing a directory of friends and relatives and several of my business cards.

### New Transcriptions from Old Newspapers 67 Years Ago (444) (See this newspaper from the 12th Year of Tongzhi in the Late Qing Dynasty)

Swimming

Zichan said, "Water is gentle, and people play with it, so many die." This is just a metaphor, but the truth is not beyond this. As the saying goes, "Water and fire are merciless." Water and fire are not mentioned separately at first because everyone knows that fire can kill people, but some people may not know that water can kill people. In fact, water is even more merciless than fire. One can escape from a fire, but when a flood occurs, there is no way to escape, and people are not afraid, which is very ridiculous. Recently, I have read in newspapers that many people have died from swimming, so I want to call out and wake people up. Even sages are not exempt from bathing and singing on the Yi River. At this time of intense heat, it is certainly pedantic to insist that everyone should adhere to the advice of concealing oneself from the heat and not wearing clothes that block the heat. However, there are methods for bathing in water. Those who have died from swimming in the news all took their own deaths; it is not that water can necessarily kill people. Those who are good at swimming always want to show off their skills. When they first enter the water, they rely on a burst of courage and can easily float and sink. The onlookers on the shore applaud, so they exert more effort to win the praise of the viewers, not considering that their strength is already exhausted. They still want to support themselves, but they do not know that when the vital energy is weak and their strength is thin, the force of the water becomes greater, leading to a risk to their lives. Some say that there are ghosts taking their place, so they die, but that is not true.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand in Balance

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the HSBC listing. In the informal market for British and American exchange rates, supply and demand were balanced, with small fluctuations. The market was unremarkable. At the beginning of the morning, the exchange rate rose by as much as five points. After opening until closing, the British exchange rate was tight, and the American exchange rate was loose. Transactions were mainly in American exchange rates. Initially, Chinese banks and speculators were selling, but these were absorbed by foreign firms. Later, foreign firms settled their accounts, and it seemed that funds were slightly insufficient. It was also rumored that a Japanese bank exchanged about 200,000 yuan in British gold (difficult to verify). Therefore, the July American exchange rate was slightly weak at 0.03125. At the close, British gold was 3 shillings 8.90625 pence, and the American exchange rate was 6 yuan. Compared to the previous day, British was tighter by 0.01565, and American was stronger by 0.0625. The futures trend was the same.

British and American Exchange Rates Rise by Five Points

At the beginning of the morning, the London exchange rate was down 0.0625 for spot and 0.125 for forward. The New York silver price was still flat, and the London gold price was stable. The exchange rate was unchanged for British against American, up 0.03125 against Shanghai, and there was no market against French. American rose by five points against British, down by a small amount against Shanghai, and there was no market against French. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. At the morning opening, the banks' spot selling price was 3 shillings 8.875 pence for British gold and 6 yuan for American exchange rate. Compared with the previous day's late close, British was tighter by 0.03125, and American was stronger by 0.0625, due to the exchange rate rebound. After opening, Chinese banks came to sell first, and the market was quiet but firm. Initially, Chinese banks sold spot American exchange rate to foreign firms at 6 yuan, then a foreign firm, Liu, did spot American exchange rate at 6.03125 yuan. The HSBC listing was unchanged. The silver balancing tax was reduced by 0.25%. Soon, speculators also came to sell, but Chinese and American banks had the appetite to absorb them, and there was little impact. It was calculated that the main local banks and American banks, as well as speculators, did the American exchange rate at 6 yuan. Later, foreign firms started to settle current American exchange rate and this month's futures, so traders slightly exceeded sellers, and the market slightly softened. However, the foreign firms continued to absorb spot American exchange rate from foreign firms at 6 yuan. The local banks' American exchange rate had softened to 5.96875 yuan. The closing situation was similar. British gold was 3 shillings 8.90625 pence, and the American exchange rate was 6 yuan. This month, British gold was the same price as spot, and the American exchange rate was 5.96875 yuan. July British gold was 3 shillings 8.84375 pence, and the American exchange rate was 5.90625 yuan. Compared to the previous night's close, spot British was softer by 0.015625, and American was stronger by 0.0625. July British gold also decreased by 0.015625, while American increased by 0.03125. August British was tighter by 0.03125, and American was loose by 0.03125. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

British exchange rate was 3 shillings 8.8625 pence, and American exchange rate was 5.5625 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate was unchanged, still at 108 yuan. "Joint Currency" informal market was cheaper by half a yuan, at 14.75 yuan.

### Little Enthusiasm in Bull or Bear Market, Gold Market Stagnant

Yesterday's spot gold informal market was lackluster. Fluctuations narrowed, and the trend was stagnant. Operators were cautious in observation, and trading interest was not strong. The opening price was 5,380 yuan. Later, the bank boss came to sell, and the price fell by another 40 yuan. At that time, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate was firmer, but soon the exchange market rebounded slightly, and buying interest increased. Gold firms and securities firms bought more, raising the price to 5,420 yuan. Later, money changers sold as the price rose, and the price re-entered the 5,400 yuan mark. The closing price was 5,410 yuan, only 5 yuan lower than the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. About one thousand and several hundred taels were traded in half a day. Jewelry gold first fell and then returned to flat. Customs gold was stagnant.

Spot Gold Squeezed Down by Five Yuan

At the beginning of the morning, with the exchange rate firm and the American exchange rate loose, the market was weak at the opening. The price was immediately pushed down by 35 yuan. A gold firm sold 20 taels to a bank at 5,380 yuan. Later, as banks and gold firms competed to sell, the price fell by another 40 yuan. A gold firm sold 20 taels to a bank, dropping to 5,340 yuan. Soon, as the exchange rate firmed, buying interest was stimulated. Securities firms and a certain gold firm bought a lot, and the price soon rebounded by 80 yuan. A gold firm sold 20 taels to a bank, raising the price to 5,420 yuan. After this, the exchange market loosened again. Money changers and retail investors sold, pushing the price down by another 40 yuan. A securities firm sold 30 taels to a gold firm, pulling the price back to 5,380 yuan. At noon, because the market sentiment was still good, gold firms and banks took advantage of the low prices to buy, and the price rebounded by another 30 yuan. A gold firm sold 10 taels to a bank, making the noon closing price 5,410 yuan. As a result, the price was squeezed down by 5 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by 80 yuan in half a day. The selling price of spot gold by cash gold firms was a dozen yuan higher than spot, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The spot price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there was little trading.

Jewelry Gold First Down Then Flat

At the beginning of the day, the selling price of jewelry gold by Dahangxing remained at 560 yuan per tael. At 9:40, it was reduced by 10 yuan, and at 10:45, it rebounded by 10 yuan. After that, it did not change. As a result, Dahangxing remained at 560 yuan. The new bank had the same price as the old price, and the buying price was about 30 yuan lower.

### Narrow Fluctuations in American Dollar Notes

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot gold rise and fall, eventually falling slightly. Supply and demand for British and American gold pounds were fairly even, and market prices tended to be stable. British gold notes also changed little. American dollar notes fluctuated, but the range was very narrow, and eventually rose slightly by 7 cents. Hong Kong notes were in slightly higher demand, and the market price rose slightly by 2 cents. Japanese gold notes were in high demand, and the evening market rose to 1.21 yuan, up 1.5 cents from the previous day. Korean notes had balanced supply and demand, and the market price was stable, remaining at 98 cents in the evening market.

### Sharp Decline in Discount Rate

Yesterday's discount rate for bank drafts and notes saw a sharp decline. For every thousand yuan, the discount rate fell to 55 yuan in the morning and was 57 yuan for selling. In the afternoon, it decreased to 54 yuan, with the discount rate falling to only 52 yuan, a sharp drop of 7 yuan compared to the previous day. The money industry association's interbank lending rate did not change, remaining at 20 cents for both the morning and afternoon markets.

### British and Indian Silver Both Down Slightly

London, 12th - The price of silver fell 0.0625 for spot and 0.125 for forward. Speculators sold, with small transactions, the market was flat. The market recovered at the close and remained flat. Also, New York reported that the American silver price remained unchanged for spot. Bombay reported that both current and futures Indian silver prices fell by four annas. The market was flat, with a total of 125 transactions.

### Abundant Grain, Rice Price Stable, Another 8,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive

After the foreign rice market fell sharply again the day before yesterday, yesterday morning's opening was able to attract local store activity to take advantage of the cheap prices. At that time, the situation was particularly bleak, and hawking sounds followed. Prices of all kinds of foreign rice once increased by about one yuan compared to the previous closing price. For example, No. 1 Chen Saigon was sold for 61.2 yuan, 61 yuan, No. 2 was 58 yuan, and Huowen was 60 yuan. However, after a long period of fatigue, confidence was not strong, and prices stopped rising as soon as they increased. As a result, the market changed again and turned soft. Thus, prices fell steadily until the close, without raising its head. The closing prices all returned to the original levels, with little profit or loss. No. 1 Chen Saigon remained at 60 yuan 5 cents and 60 yuan, and No. 2 was 57.5 yuan, 57 yuan.

Yesterday, foreign rice futures fell slightly by 3-4 cents, with little trading. The returned goods only did 75 tons of Siam No. 2 rice loaded on June 20 at a price of 68.8 to 5 cents, and 100 tons loaded on June 26 at a price of 67.7 to 8.5 yuan. The price of Saigon No. 2 rice loaded on the 11th of this month was 66 yuan. It is said that a group is also finalizing an order for 6,000 tons of rice.

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Hai Ri ship arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the day before yesterday, carrying 7,905 bags from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's wharf in Pudong. Unloading began yesterday morning. (Ancestral)

The distribution of glutinous rice is still not widespread, but since the goods are scarce, the owners are no longer willing to release them easily, so the situation is stable. The opening price and the previous closing price for Jin Li Baiyuan remained at 65 yuan, Changdan goods were 63-4 yuan, and Hong Kong Baiyuan was 65 yuan.

The supply of thick and thin japonica rice was only 600-700 bags. Outside the market, rumors spread that the owners were persistent due to the rebound in the foreign rice early market, and shouting prices were high. However, the subsequent market shifted, and the wish was not granted. As a result, all were said to be at a fixed price, with no changes. Changbang special grade japonica was 70 yuan, Su Kun Changzhou japonica was 67-8 yuan, Juezhi Su was 64-5 yuan, Qing Si thin rice was 68-9 yuan, and Nangang early rice was 65-6 yuan.

### Financial Review - Ending July 13th -

— Saint Kerry Qiong

The Inflation of Japanese Currency

Based on the figures at the end of June, the amount of Japanese currency is approximately 600 billion yuan, with nine zeros at the end. Starting with the issuance of Japanese banknotes, after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Bank of Japan's issuance increased by 50 billion yuan annually in 1937-1939. The increase in 1939-1940 was approximately 100 billion yuan, showing a sharp upward trend. Looking at the combined figures of the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Korea, and the Bank of Taiwan, the annual increase was 60 billion yuan in 1937-1939, and approximately 120 billion yuan in 1939-1940. If 1937 is taken as 100, then 1938 is 130, 1939 is 160, and 1940 is 225. The account of the number of Japanese banknotes issued from June of last year to June of this year is no wonder that the Japanese financial circles regard it as a "red alarm." The issuance figures for the three banks at the end of June each year are attached (unit: million Japanese yen):

40th Year 39th Year 38th Year 37th Year

Bank of Japan 3,597 2,522 2,074 1,640

Bank of Korea 437 285 254 151

Bank of Taiwan 176 146 105 75

Total 4,211 2,954 2,433 1,867

The Japanese government has always been extremely secretive about the inflation of Bank of Japan banknotes. Whenever the amount of issuance exceeds the total of gold reserves and security reserves, it expands the amount of security reserves to compensate. However, even after the security reserves were repeatedly expanded from 50 billion yen to 220 billion yuan, the issuance still exceeded the limit. At the same time, the security reserves were government bonds. Government bonds and banknotes are essentially the same, and the wavering of banknote credit is an inevitable result.

Therefore, in addition to expanding the issuance of the banks in Korea and Taiwan, under the policy of using war to support war and developing the occupied areas, efforts are being made to inflate the yen group currency. At the same time, in order to avoid the inflation of the yen in the Central China area, military scrip is issued to replace it.

As mentioned above, although the total of the three Japanese banks was 421.1 billion yuan at the end of June this year, the total sum of Japanese currency far exceeds this number. Therefore, this number must be added to another 124.9 billion yuan of other Japanese currencies. An analysis is as follows:

The first to be mentioned is the "Central Bank of Manchuria." The number of issuances on June 25th this year was 63.4 billion yuan, and at the end of June it was 63 billion yuan. The former number increased by 16 million yuan compared to May, but increased by 246,113,000 yuan compared to June of last year. The next is the "United Reserve Bank," whose issuance at the end of June this year was 55.8 billion yuan, an increase of 10 billion yuan compared to the end of last year. Even more, the "Mengjiang Bank" had 6.1 billion yuan at the end of June this year, an increase of 6 million yuan compared to the end of last year and an increase of 28 million yuan compared to the end of June last year. The extent of this inflation is truly frighteningly rapid.

The total of these six banks is 546 billion yuan, but this is not the accurate amount of Japanese currency. We will add 40 million yuan obtained from the reorganization of old banknotes in April 1939, and 70 million Japanese banknotes released in May of the same year due to the expansion of the security reserve limit of the Korean and Taiwanese banks (these Japanese banknotes were used as the issuance reserve of the Korean and Taiwanese banks), and 260 million yuan in small denomination banknotes (figures from the end of May this year), plus an estimated 200 million yuan in military scrip used in Central and Southern China (some estimates are 100 million yuan). The total of these four numbers is 570 million yuan. In this way, the total sum of Japanese currency is 6,010,000,000 yuan, truly an enormous figure.

Forcibly Elevating the Value of "Lianchao" (United Currency)

The "United Reserve Bank" banknotes, which are used by the Japanese in North China as a tool for manipulation, have an artificial value far below that of the Shanghai legal tender due to the excessive issuance. However, "Lianchao" is linked to the Japanese yen at par, which affects the value of the Japanese yen, causing it to fall as well. The Japanese have devised various methods to maintain "Lianchao," but in the case of excessive inflation, its value is still much lower. The vast North China still trusts the legal tender as the legal currency. In the past, the British concession in Tianjin did not recognize the power of "Lianchao" as a legal currency. However, after the currency agreement in the Tianjin Concession Agreement on June 19th, "The British Engineering Bureau shall not hinder the banknotes of the United Reserve Bank in any way," the work to increase the value of "Lianchao" followed. First, on June 26th, the control of import trade in North China was strengthened. Then, on July 10th, restrictions were implemented on loans from the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Korea in North China. The measures are as follows:

The content of strengthening import control: (1) For goods ordered from regions other than Japan and Manchuria (such as third countries and Central and Southern China) and supplied with foreign exchange by "Lianchao," it is necessary to obtain a "Letter of Approval for Orders" issued by "Lianchao" in advance. However, the import of six kinds of grains—wheat, flour, rice, millet, sorghum, and corn—does not need to go through the above approval for the time being. (2) For goods imported from Japan, Manchuria, third countries, and Central and Southern China that do not require foreign exchange from "Lianchao," it is necessary to obtain a "Permit for Import Without Exchange" issued by the Customs Superintendent in advance. Otherwise, they shall not be declared for import. According to the import control in North China, it was implemented after March 2, 1939. It is usually stipulated that there are 42 categories of imported goods. On July 6 of last year, it was increased to 95 categories, that is, 10% of the foreign exchange earned by "Lianchao" from exports is deducted as the balance for normal remittances for distribution. However, due to the concessions, it was impossible to control imports for which "Lianchao" did not supply foreign exchange and imports that were cleared with legal tender. Now that the concessions are under Japanese control, the areas that have not yet been controlled are urgently being controlled.

After this method is implemented, imports will not be allowed without a "Letter of Approval for Orders" or a "Permit for Import Without Exchange." The exports from third countries and Central and Southern China to North China will naturally be prohibited. As a result, the need for legal tender in North China can be reduced, and the amount of legal tender bought with Lianchao can be reduced, in order to gradually eliminate the link between the value of Lianchao and the survival of legal tender, and to seek the independence and strengthening of the value of Lianchao.

However, "Lianchao" had already been issued to 558,000,000 yuan by the end of June. How can its value not fall with such inflation? It is not easy to achieve results by relying solely on strengthening import control. Therefore, the Japanese authorities again prohibited and restricted loans from the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Korea starting from July 10th, stipulating that equipment fund loans of less than 500,000 yuan must be approved by the Japanese Finance Officer stationed in Beijing, and loans above this amount must be approved by the Ministry of Finance. Loans of less than 50,000 yuan must be reported to the Finance Officer. For loans other than equipment funds, those between 100,000 and 500,000 yuan must be approved by the Finance Officer, and those over 500,000 yuan must be approved by the Ministry of Finance. Those between 50,000 and 100,000 yuan must be reported to the Finance Officer. Restricting loans means prohibiting the inflow of "Lianchao" into the market, in order to prevent the value from falling due to inflation.

Recently, the value of "Lianchao" has increased from 100.5 on June 19th to 94.00 on the 22nd, but later it fell to 99.00, and on July 5th it rose again to around 90 yuan. This week it has fallen again to around 94 yuan. The above figures are the number of "Lianchao" for 100 yuan of legal tender in North China. It can be seen that its value fluctuates very sharply. Although the future is unpredictable, judging from its issuance, since the establishment of the "United Reserve Bank" in 1938, the "Lianchao" has increased by approximately 100 million yuan every six months. If the issuance continues this trajectory in the future, its value will probably not be able to increase or be maintained. (To be continued)

### Flour Market Gradually Falls into People's Hands

Yesterday, the flour market saw another decline in Japanese factory flour. The opening prices were 15 yuan and 3 jiao for the Phoenix brand in July, 15 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 fen for August, and 15 yuan and 7 jiao for September, a small drop of 1 jiao and 2 jiao and 3 fen compared to before. This began to attract inquiries from local and regional merchants. 6,000 bags were traded. Other domestic miscellaneous brand flours were also dragged down by 1 jiao or 2 jiao, but there were no whole batches opened. On the Chinese factory side, only Fufeng supplied around 4,000 bags of Lao Jun brand flour to the local noodle and pancake industries, maintaining the original price of 15 yuan and 2 jiao. It is heard that merchants in Zhejiang and Ningbo are gradually purchasing foreign flour, and with the sharp fall in rice prices, the market seems to be showing signs of loosening.

Wheat: As it is the weekend period, the trading of new wheat is even more quiet. However, at present, the sources from land and water are constantly arriving, and the goods waiting to be sold in the warehouses in Hongkou are gradually becoming abundant. It is heard that the price paid by the Japanese factories for the goods they receive has dropped by another 4 or 5 jiao.

### Securities: Domestic Debt is Dull

The unofficial securities market is becoming increasingly quiet. Throughout the day, only four market quotations were made for the five types of public bonds. The situation is unprecedentedly dull and lifeless. In addition, due to the weekend, trading is even more sluggish. However, the original trading volume of each firm is not small. Everyone is waiting to see the changes in the environment. Without the stimulation of new news, this kind of depressing situation will not be easy to break. Yesterday, the trading volume in both the morning and afternoon markets was extremely low. Only Wuyuan and Xinfuhao slightly bought in, and scattered individual investors slightly sold out. The market prices in the morning and afternoon were completely equal. Except for Type D, which did not open throughout the day, each of the other types only had one market quotation. The total transaction volume is estimated to be no more than 200,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below:

Stock Transactions: 100 shares of Xinxin Company stock were traded at a price of 10 yuan, 0 jiao, and 2.5 fen.

London, July 12 (Friday): The listed prices of Far Eastern British companies' stocks remained stable today. Only the London-registered shares of HSBC Bank continued to fall by one pound, at a price of 63 pounds. The Hong Kong-registered shares remained unchanged, and the rest also did not fall.

London, July 12 (Friday): The listed prices of Chinese foreign debts remained stable today. There were no changes in the upper and lower grade bonds.

The Rubber Estate Company, Limited, managed by the British firm Huitong Yanghang, will pay an interim dividend for the year 1940 on August 6th, at a rate of one yuan and five jiao per share in national currency.

### Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Mill Purchases Gradually Moving

The spot cotton trading is slightly more active, because the purchases of the Xinyu factory are relatively strong, and no other actions have been seen, so the market price is flat. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left:

Dazhongji 205.00 209.00 Chengfu purchased 210 bales

Yamla 185.0012 One purchased 160 bales

Not recorded on the previous day

Changyinsha Packed 188.00 Xinyu purchased 168 bales

Xiasha American Type 205.25 Another 600 bales

Tongzhou Fine Velvet 209.00 Chengfu purchased 150 bales

Another dispatch: The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, was unusually quiet yesterday, and the video head did not continue. Later, due to the selling of the South and the closing of some bulls, the closing price fell by 23 pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian market situation is firm, and yesterday, including forecasts, it rose by another 34 rupees.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been continuously lively recently, especially by Japanese manufacturers and colleagues. Although Chinese factories are quieter, they also have a considerable intention to purchase. The general opinion is that the cotton market in the future will gradually move towards a better situation.

### 20-Count Double Horse Yarn Hovers Around 1,000 Yuan

The yarn market has once again entered a hovering path. This is because the Yue merchants, who have been actively purchasing for several days, seem to be satisfied and are temporarily resting. As a result, people's hearts have calmed down slightly, and the market has loosened. However, the majority of colleagues still tend to be buyers, so the price has a strong hovering force.

The opening market atmosphere for spot yarn this morning has turned peaceful. The psychology of the majority in the market is that the opening price is high and tends to be on the selling side. As a result, the market opened slightly lower. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,010 yuan. Once this price was opened, sellers were still active. The general upper-day hedging parties all made hat tricks by first selling and then buying in. As a result, the market loosened and fell straight to 995 yuan. At this time, a certain person who sold out the previous day watched and did not move, and even pulled in when the price was low. The market price rebounded to 1,014 yuan. Later, the sales to customers were not smooth, and it was relatively sluggish, and it took another small step. The closing price was 1,010 yuan. The statistics of transactions in half a day totaled 1,555. The price of Double Horse fell by 3 yuan. Today, there are 8 pieces of cotton yarn, 50 pieces transported to Ningbo, 24 pieces transported to Luoluo, 405 pieces transported to Hong Kong, and 320 pieces transported to Yantai. The amount bought by each gangkou is listed as follows:

Colleagues 1.025 Hong Kong 26 Yunnan 200 Ningbo 70 Total 1.555

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Transactions are Scarce

The momentum of the cloth market has weakened slightly. This is because the continuous sharp rise has caused some floating hoarding to sell off for profit, and the factory's opening of goods has also loosened slightly. The selling price has fallen slightly, with white goods (coarse and fine) down 2.5 to 5 jiao per piece. The price of bleached and dyed cloth is mostly unchanged. New transactions among hoarders have suddenly faded. Spot sales from the Zhejiang and Wen Yong gangs are still smooth. Several hundred pieces of colored cloth, dyed materials, and coarse cloth were purchased. More than 100 pieces of heavy coarse cloth and serge were purchased by the Yantai gang. More than 300 pieces of white goods and bleached and dyed cloth were traded in this street. More than 100 pieces of coarse twill, fine twill, and colored cloth were purchased by the Yuegang gang.

Yesterday, the factory announced that for Longtou fine cloth of Dongbu, for the warehouse orders issued before May (excluding June orders), if they have not been cleared from August onwards, warehouse rent will be increased, charging 10 yuan per piece. Therefore, those in the industry who hold warehouse orders before May urgently want to sell them off and exchange them for new orders. The market price was therefore suppressed. The morning closing price was 30 yuan, 0 jiao, and 1.5 fen. In the afternoon, there was no market due to Saturday. Sijunzi serge was still sold for 8 jiao, 8 and 9 fen. The warehouse rent for middle-grade fine cloth and fine twill serge remained the same. The price of fine cloth fell by about 2.5 jiao per piece.

Exports of piece goods on the 14th: 155 pieces were transported to Yantai, 245 pieces were transported to Hong Kong, 160 pieces were transported to Siam, and 540 pieces were transported to Ningbo.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Slightly Loosened

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to see a slight drop due to the scarcity of incoming merchants. The guild’s marked prices for spot goods were 67 yuan, 7 jiao negative, small triangle, and 53 yuan, 1 jiao to 2 jiao for re-export goods that immediately hit warehouse receipts. 54 yuan to 53 yuan, 9 jiao, small three or four jiao were asked for goods delivered on the 22nd. Taikoo’s Car White B Mark, West Warehouse, was 78 yuan, and East Warehouse was 77 yuan and a half, with no change. Dutch red also rose by 3 jiao, to 58 yuan and 8 jiao. A Guang merchant of State Sugar opened with 40 boxes of Tiaoqing at a price of 47 yuan, but there were no other transactions.

### Five-Point Tin: Shortage and High Demand

Since the deterioration of the situation in Hong Kong and Vietnam, the five-point tin market has tended to be strong. The reason is that the source is cut off, and the Shanghai market inventory feels quite short, so the holders are optimistic, and the market is increasing step by step. The current market price for 99.9% purity is about 1,450 yuan, which is 20 to 30 yuan higher than before. However, the trade is due to the sluggish business of the foil shops in Shaoxing and Ningbo, and they have been waiting and watching in Shanghai for a long time. They still have no intention to move. Only the general retail buyers in the street can cope with the current sluggish market situation. Wholesale trade is hardly worth mentioning.

### Wood Nail Market Loosens

Since the heavy blow from the Nanyang Gang, the trading of wood nails from this factory has been in a slump, and the current market still has no improvement. The market price is declining every day, currently selling at 46 yuan, plus extra fees per barrel. Business is only with the construction gang and retail buyers.

### North-South Goods: Two Batches of Haikou Branches Arrive

Two batches of new Haikou branch goods arrived the day before yesterday by the Yusheng Wheel, totaling more than 2,700 boxes, which is a large number. The market trend prevents softening, and the opening price may turn down. The big ones can start opening tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, it is said.

### Wool and Raincoat Cloth: English Goods are the Most Expensive

Raincoat cloth, English-made Robellin and single-sided open water beauty, solid-color wool surface, etc., have not arrived in port. Only a few companies in the industry, such as Yikang and Changji, have some inventory, resulting in high and expensive goods, and most are unable to replenish them.

### The picture on the right shows Joan of Arc of France encouraging morale and repelling the British army during the Hundred Years' War.

### France Today

The French Revolution of 1789 once shook the whole world, what a magnificent event. The three slogans of freedom, equality, and fraternity it advocated are still yearned for by people today. Unexpectedly, the democratic commemoration this year, 150 years later, is in such a miserable state. The well-trained army has been defeated by its age-old enemy, Germany, and the powerful navy, ranking second in Europe, has been tearfully seized a large part of it by the Allied countries a month ago. Even in politics, democracy has been abolished and dictatorship has been implemented. Could it be said that today's democratic commemoration is its last? Is this kind of change, perhaps, as declared by the new French dictator, General Pétain, an emergency measure that must be taken during the national crisis, to strive for a glorious peace, and to rebuild France independently?

All kinds of changes are like a big dream. Apart from expressing sympathy, there is nothing else to say. It's just that the beautiful rivers and mountains of mainland France, even if a part of them are being occupied by the German army, are still worth a visit.

France can largely be regarded as an agricultural country; in terms of its customs and local conditions, it is a very complex country, and the local scenery everywhere is very lovely. The east is called Burgundy, and flat mountains extend to the Rhine River basin. The area is mostly wheat fields and vineyards. The north is the Flanders Plain, which has been a place of military operations since ancient times, and the surviving trees are few and far between. The northwest is Normandy, a green field, rich in products, and the residents are brave and good at fighting. William the Conqueror, who conquered England in 1066, came from this area. The west is Brittany, bordering the Atlantic Ocean, with a rough dialect, and the residents still hold independent ideas. The southeast has the Alps, which extend for hundreds of miles and are covered with snow all year round. They are the source of the blue coastline of the Mediterranean and the rivers. The south is Provence, where olive trees and orange trees are found in abundance. In addition, there are also Basque, Gascony, and Auvergne. Although they are not easy to see on today's maps, the residents of each place still maintain their inherent characteristics. However, the history of French unification has transformed them all into French people, just as the United States of America has transformed various immigrants into Americans.

### New York World's Fair Chronicle E. L. (Continued from Previous Issue)

General Overview of the Fairgrounds

As mentioned previously, the fairgrounds are broadly divided into two sections. The exhibition section can be further categorized into five major areas: Government, Lifestyle, Food, Transportation, and Production. The entertainment area features a variety of performances and can be divided into land and water sections.

The layout of the fairgrounds is roughly rectangular. The northern two-thirds of the area is dedicated to exhibitions, while the southern part is for entertainment. The buildings in the exhibition area are magnificent, showcasing either their function or national identity. The central structures in this section are a large "Sphere" and a towering "Obelisk," which are easily visible from the air. The "Sphere" represents internationalism, while the "Obelisk" symbolizes American independence and freedom. To the east of these central landmarks are the "International Lagoon" and "Peace Plaza"; to the west are the City Hall Plaza and the New York City Pavilion.

The entertainment area, known as the "Great White Way," is located east of "Liberty Lake," with numerous buildings along the shore. It is divided into sections for theater, music, sports, animal displays, and variety shows. At night, fireworks light up the sky, reflecting in the lake, creating a beautiful scene. This entertainment hub is a highlight of this year's fair and can be considered the world's largest amusement park.

Viewed from above, the fairgrounds resemble an open, colorful fan spread across a three-mile square area. In terms of function, it can be divided into an industrial exhibition zone, a government and foreign exhibition zone, and an entertainment zone. Between the "Sphere," "Obelisk," and "International Lagoon" lies the "Court of Peace." This "Court" is a vast space with avenues, pools, lawns, flowerbeds, and trees, featuring historical statues, including an eighty-five-foot-tall statue of Washington. From the "Court of Peace," pathways radiate in all directions, leading to various exhibition areas. The "International Lagoon" is most beautiful at night, with fireworks, colorful fountains, and electric rainbows all concentrated here, making it the dazzling central area of the "World's Fair."

A Glimpse of the Exhibits

This World's Fair is not just a kaleidoscope but also a comprehensive collection of worldly knowledge and a record of human intelligence and folly. Visitors are not merely experiencing novelties and viewing curiosities but are also, unknowingly, gaining a wealth of knowledge. The exhibits are diverse and all-encompassing. Even with several days, one cannot fully appreciate everything on display. This is only a glimpse of one or two percent of what is available.

Production: This section can be said to be a compilation of novelties, with each exhibit organized by the producer. Given the current hot weather, we might focus on the climate control exhibits. There is a small glass house where machines measure the temperature of a person after they enter. There is also a large hall showcasing the achievements of air conditioning, demonstrating how air is conditioned to suit individual body temperatures in places like a mine 8,500 feet deep, a factory in the Arctic Ocean, or a telephone company in the tropics. Other exhibits in this section include photography, electricity, clocks, glass, hardware, petroleum, electricity, steel cables, and more.

Transportation: This includes exhibits on automobiles, rubber tires, trains, and airplanes. The displays by Chrysler and General Motors are particularly noteworthy. General Motors presents a scenario of highway transportation in 1960 (i.e., twenty years in the future), featuring as many as 16,000 small cars and freight vehicles. The railway plaza showcases the history of "iron horses" across ten acres and a half-mile of tracks. Twenty-seven major railway companies present exhibits, ranging from wood-burning trains to modern streamlined electric trains.

Entertainment: Americans love activity, sports, and entertainment. This "Great White Way" amusement park includes all the highlights of the entertainment world. Water entertainment, which was absent in 1939, is a new feature this year. A troupe of five hundred performers, including many beautiful women, performs music on the water, creating ethereal and delightful sounds. There is also a "hot and cold" show, with the first half featuring various women dancing energetically, and the second half featuring ice-skating women, creating a chilling contrast. Numerous other attractions are also on display.

Anecdotes

Here are some interesting snippets about this year's fair:

When the fair opened last year, authorities hoped to attract at least sixty million visitors. However, the actual number of paying visitors was only 25,817,265, less than half the projection. This was considered a failure, hence the change in approach this year.

On the opening day this year, the attendance reached 188,100 by 9 p.m. A total of 1,385 New York police officers and detectives were deployed to maintain order in and around the fairgrounds.

The fair provides excellent dining options. There are no fewer than sixty restaurants, serving approximately 150,000 diners on the opening day. A variety of teas and meals are available at different price points to cater for all palates. Prices range from as little as two or three dimes to as much as two or three dollars. During the 1939 fair, a total of 12 million hot dog sandwiches were sold, truly a grand spectacle.

The construction cost of the three hundred buildings in the fairgrounds ranged between forty and fifty million US dollars. The construction work was almost equivalent to building a city that could house 80,000 residents, and the construction period was only three years.

There are sixty movie theaters in the fairgrounds, showing over five hundred films daily, including silent, sound, and color films.

At least three thousand flags are displayed throughout the fairgrounds, representing seventy-one countries, fifty-four states, and countless organizations and associations.

The underground water pipes, gas pipes, garbage pipes, and electrical conduits in the fairgrounds cost a total of US$12 million, which visitors cannot see.

Over two hundred tons of paint were used for building construction last year, and over one hundred tons of paint have already been used for renovations this spring.

The fair's main entrance can accommodate 160,000 people per hour.

The jewelry and diamond section in the "Lifestyle" exhibition area is worth millions of dollars. Two large boxes of uncut diamonds, worth US$1.5 million, are guarded by specially built guardhouses with armed police.

### Molotov and Ribbentrop (Part 1)

— En

Ten months have passed since the signing of the German-Soviet Pact, which is considered a major issue in the European war. Will the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union become closer from now on, or will it suddenly turn into a break and war? The answer to this question largely depends on the actions of the officials who negotiated the pact, namely Molotov and Ribbentrop, two of the most active figures in Europe. Now, let's introduce a sketch of these two behind-the-scenes figures who brought Hitler and Stalin together, as described by New York Herald-Tribune's European correspondent, Parson.

Astute political observers are still somewhat confused as to whether Stalin is acting as Hitler's puppet, or whether the German leader has become a puppet of the mysterious Soviet leader.

On August 23, 1939, the two countries concluded a bizarre marriage, and at the time, it was considered unbelievable that the Communist Party and the National Socialist Party could combine. It would be an understatement to regard Molotov and Ribbentrop as merely guests at this wedding. Anyone familiar with the personalities of Molotov and Ribbentrop and the process of their career achievements would certainly not consider these two ambitious offensive diplomats to be merely echoing their masters. Instead, one must acknowledge that this elusive German-Soviet agreement was entirely orchestrated by them.

Molotov's appearance is similar to that of former US President Theodore Roosevelt. He has broad shoulders, a round head, and a thick neck, suggesting vitality. Below his high-bridged nose, he has a short mustache, and his passionate eyes peer through his pince-nez glasses. He exudes the aura of a boxer and a university professor. Every movement reveals strength and confidence. When he speaks, his intonation, when grasping the key points, has that high pitch, and his expression on stage is similar to that of Theodore Roosevelt, truly having the same effect through different means. However, Molotov has a stutter. Strangely, his stutter is related to his mood. Sometimes he can give speeches for hours without any stuttering. At other times, he stammers incoherently. But although his speech is not perfect, he has another kind of power that can attract listeners.

Molotov resembles Theodore Roosevelt not only in appearance. His temperament is imbued with the same indomitable human vitality as Theodore Roosevelt. Once he starts a task, no opposing force can

Molotov, the Soviet Foreign Minister, stop him. If someone tries to argue with even a small part of his plan, he will exhaust himself trying to convince that person. He deals with opponents in a sweeping manner.

However, Russians lack the distinct American personality. Molotov does not have Theodore Roosevelt's quick wit, nor his unique sense of humor. This communist leader has only one simple path in mind. Therefore, his thinking speed is slow. His colleagues know that Molotov's final decision on a matter is unwavering, because he has almost completely and carefully studied other solutions.

Molotov's original name was Vyacheslav Skryabin, and he was the son of a small merchant, born fifty years ago. "Molotov" means "hammer" in Russian, which was a pseudonym he used in his youth when engaging in revolutionary work at the grassroots level. The world-renowned music composer Alexander Skryabin was his uncle, who was a member of the Russian aristocracy, so Molotov's political enemies often attacked him for this kinship. In fact, apart from a hereditary love of music, Molotov never materially benefited from his uncle. His father was extremely poor and had to squeeze his own blood and sweat to nurture his son to obtain a higher education.

As a young man, Molotov was forced to struggle for a living due to hunger and cold. He was unwilling to accept his father's assistance. He was extremely intelligent and could have become a successful economics professor or, apart from his stutter, a lawyer. But he finally joined the revolutionary work, disregarding the danger, placing himself at the grassroots level, organizing communist cells in factories and even in the St. Petersburg Technological Institute where he studied.

At that time, Molotov was a pale-faced, thin young man. He wore tattered clothes, had messy hair, and did not wear glasses despite his nearsightedness. Like a group of radical young people, it seemed that their lives were destined to debate Marxism on the podium or in small restaurants.

He studied many books in prison, because he was arrested from time to time, and his university courses were intermittent. He worked as an editor for the secret communist newspaper Pravda, and Stalin was the editor-in-chief. During that period, he and Stalin became close friends, so it was the "Man of Steel" who promoted this "Hammer" to become a leader. When Molotov was twenty-six years old, he was exiled by the Russian Emperor to Siberia, but he escaped a few months later.

The following year, 1917, was the height of the Russian Revolution, and Molotov became one of the Communist Party's most capable leaders. Although he suffered from imprisonment, poverty, and hunger, his mind and body were not damaged. Strangely, it made his body stronger. His broad shoulders and fearless and realistic approach to various issues made him stand out among his colleagues. Molotov and Trotsky eventually felt difficult to get along with each other. Trotsky often said that he was a person "without hope and without creativity."

After Lenin returned to Russia, Molotov relinquished his nominal leadership to him. But in less than two years, he distinguished himself again, took a position of importance, and became a rising star among Soviet economists.

In 1927, he pushed forward the collective farm system regardless of everything. This task was very difficult at the beginning, and the forces of counter-revolution came fiercely. Therefore, several communist leaders advised to temporarily abandon this plan. Even Stalin was afraid to act for a while, feeling that millions of powerful peasants were determined to protect their land, and the force of opposition to socialism was not to be insulted. Molotov, however, unleashed his "Hammer" and violently attacked the opposition, and as a result, the largest peasant revolution in human history was completed.

When other communist leaders were afraid of Stalin's likes and dislikes and became indifferent to everything, Molotov continued to be active and did not care about personal honor or disgrace. In 1930, when he was elected Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, he did not regard the chairmanship as an empty title, but strongly urged other members to carry out the duties of the prime minister, and he was particularly disgusted with bribery and dereliction of duty. His colleagues thought he was even more terrible than Stalin.

In 1935, when Stalin was carrying out a large-scale purge of the so-called Trotzkyists for "overthrowing" the government and forming secret alliances with the German military authorities, Molotov suggested conducting peace negotiations with Hitler at the seventh session of the Soviet Union. In his speech, sensitive ears could already hear that he had already made up his mind to lean towards signing the German-Soviet Pact. The chairman of the People's Committee demanded that Hitler withdraw all the threats against the Soviet Union in his book "Mein Kampf," thereby building a road to peace between Germany and the Soviet Union. Although Stalin had already decided internally to purge several important members of the party who were inclined to ally with Germany, he saw that his own senior officials publicly advocated reconciliation with Germany. After listening to Molotov's grand speech, Stalin, strangely enough, accepted it all.

Molotov only walks one path and speaks only one kind of language. He is a realistic thinker. Ribbentrop is witty and elegant, speaks several languages, and adapts to circumstances. These two are absolutely opposite, and such a contrast is nowhere to be found. One is a diplomat with a big fist and thick arms, while the other has the style of wearing velvet gloves. Russians are crude and uncultured, lack flexibility, do not beat around the bush, and do not care about social niceties. Germans often smile, are good at flattery, have a talent for sarcasm, and before grasping the key point, they are willing to go around in circles and discuss in many ways. The differences between the two are so great, but the similarities between the two are also strange. Both have deviated from the usual path of diplomats, are very stubborn in their own beliefs, and are not easily shaken.

### Jesus is the Savior of the Sick

Illness is the most painful thing in life, and its losses are indescribable. Throughout history, scholars have tried various methods to heal, and there have been many such people. Unfortunately, they can only treat the symptoms and not the root cause. When Jesus was in the world, the masses recognized Him as an unprecedented divine physician. Even in today's era of scientific advancement, there are incurable diseases for which no effective medical techniques have been invented that can compare to Jesus. At that time, there were all kinds of sick people who were healed by Jesus' touch. He cleansed lepers, made the blind see, made the lame walk, healed a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years, made an old woman who had been hunchbacked for eighteen years stand upright, and made a paralytic who had been paralyzed for thirty-eight years get up and run. The facts are detailed in the Bible and are by no means fabricated. More than seven hundred years before Jesus was born, a prophet had already predicted, "He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases." Jesus came to save people, manifested the great love of God in the world, and practiced medicine with love, truly being the savior of all those who suffer from pain and illness. Currently, there are more than 230 large and small hospitals established by Chinese churches, serving millions of patients every year. Remembering the source of the water we drink, we are grateful for Jesus' gifts. Jesus can not only heal various physical ailments but also heal spiritual illnesses. Physical illnesses are inherently painful, but spiritual illnesses are even more painful. What exactly are spiritual illnesses? They are sins. As the Bible says, all unrighteous things are evil, greed, malice, envy, murder, strife, deceit, hatred, sexual immorality, and other sins that arise from within, the harm of which is enough to steal the body and mind, destroy ambition, deprive life of happiness, and disrupt social peace. Jesus came into the world with the purpose of saving us and fighting against demons who harm the body and mind. He once said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." World-renowned doctors can only treat people's false illnesses, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts. They can only treat the symptoms and not the root cause. Only Jesus can cure all incurable diseases of the body and mind. Friends, if you are willing to sincerely believe, repent, and change your ways, listen to His commands, and hate evil as an enemy, He will surely give you peace, heal all your diseases, and give you the ability to be born again, filling your heart with spiritual joy and giving you physical and mental health and a more abundant life. Sick compatriots, rise up quickly! Only Jesus is your savior.

### Regarding the Essay Submission Stamp

Let me explain the meaning of the stamp:

Essay Submission Stamp

The pattern in the center, "申" is the ancient form of the character Shen, and the bell shape is a wooden clapper.

Shen Bao has the important responsibility of promoting education and spreading culture, so it adopts the meaning of the sentence "Heaven will take the master as a wooden clapper" and uses the wooden clapper to symbolize the important mission undertaken by Shen Bao!

This time it is used as a stamp for essay submission. You should paste a copy of the stamp on your submissions, otherwise the submission will be considered invalid regardless of the content. Please pay attention!

### Composition Topic Guidance

My Father: There are several aspects that can be written about in this topic: the father's occupation, the father's spare time, the father's personality, the father's scholarship, the father's business life, and the father's method of educating children. It must be about your father, not someone else's father. If you write a few points, make sure to determine the order in advance. The worst thing is to write a sentence or two for each point, turning it into an account with no highlights.

My Favorite Book: Of course, you have more than one book that you love to read, so make sure to clarify the word "favorite." Your favorite book must be one that you have already read. Summarize the main points of the book and attach your own thoughts, or raise questions, or elaborate, or supplement. Do not arbitrarily excerpt or even copy a paragraph. If you have not yet fully understood the book and cannot summarize the main points, then you should carefully and quietly read it again. When writing the essay, it is best to put the book aside to avoid being restricted by the book.

### Children's Jokes

Hu Shibiao

Mother said to Atang: "Go quietly to the hallway and see if Grandpa has fallen asleep."

Atang came back and said: "Grandpa's whole body is asleep, but his nose hasn't fallen asleep yet."

Football Match

The teacher asked the students to write a composition on the topic "Football Match" and said: "Whoever writes the fastest can go home first."

So, after two minutes, Qimei handed in her paper.

It said on the paper: "Football match stopped—heavy snow."

Indestructible Matter

The teacher taught a very young child arithmetic and said, "If you have ten chestnuts in your hand and eat four, how many are left?"

"Ten."

"Why?" the teacher asked anxiously.

"Six in my hand and four in my belly, isn't that ten?"

### Bug and Bullet

— Su Ming

The weather these days is very hot, especially one or two hours after lunch. In the past, Yonger would lazily go to school for half a day, even if it was 100 degrees hot, he had to go to school. But today is a holiday, and the hot weather really made him give up any idea of going out. After eating lunch and taking a nap for about an hour, he quietly got up. He wanted to work on his holiday homework, but he couldn't muster any interest in it. His brother was probably also staying at home because of the hot weather. So Yonger and Zonger started chatting.

"Brother, how are the wars in Europe going these days?"

"Why don't you pay attention to it all the time? It's good to cultivate the habit of reading the newspaper. The wars in Europe are raging, the fire is burning to the sky, airplanes, tanks, artillery, warships... all fully show their 'colors,' and the people have tasted the same taste of fleeing as we have. The bombing of airplanes and the shooting of anti-aircraft guns are fighting, and we also have very deep impressions of these tragic scenes of war." He paused for a while, then continued, "Speaking of anti-aircraft guns and airplanes, I recall reading a book in which one section was very interesting. I'll tell you some of the general details that I can remember, I guarantee you'll laugh (To be continued)"

### How to Practice Calligraphy During Summer Vacation (Part 2)

— Shen Baiying

(1) When practicing small characters, you can copy difficult phrases and sentences from national language textbooks, or copy stories from newspapers and magazines. One practice yields two gains, killing two birds with one stone, which is excellent.

(2) When practicing medium or large characters, you can borrow a few calligraphy copybooks from the school and take turns using them.

(3) Other materials related to application can also be collected as much as possible during the summer vacation. They will definitely be useful in the future. For example, a hygiene notice: "Everyone knows the harm of flies. Now it is summer, and many are flying out. They lay eggs everywhere, and the number is considerable, spreading cholera, as fierce as tigers and leopards. Vomiting and diarrhea, life is hard to protect. Tell my citizens, everyone should understand; pay attention to closing the garbage can lid; it is best to eat less fishy and meaty foods; quickly discard all dirt and waste. Remember! Remember! Eliminate pests as early as possible!" Another example is a store leaflet: "Goods vary in height and quality, the quality of the goods should be carefully studied. Our store carefully selects all goods and dares to say that none can surpass us. We have a complete range of household daily necessities. The quality is different from others, the pricing is different from others. We absolutely do not mix fakes with genuine products, and we absolutely do not offer false discounts. It is currently a cheap period, and we are implementing drastic price cuts. New goods are piled up like mountains, and you can freely choose and buy. Please come and visit, everyone, and you will know that what I say is not false."

Some of you may ask, "Now that paper is expensive, what inexpensive things can be used?" According to my thoughts, there are two ways: one is to use old newspapers or broken books to write on; the other is to use a large square brick dipped in water to write on. In addition, there may be better methods, please tell me, I can't think of any more.

Finally, you also want to ask me in passing: "After writing well in school, you can ask the teacher to critique it. Which characters are written well, which are written poorly. Where are the poorly written ones wrong, and how should they be corrected next time. Every critique is a step forward. Now that summer vacation has started, and I am studying at home, who will critique me?" I think, as long as you practice diligently every day, critique is always a small matter. Here are a few ways you can use for reference:

The first way is to ask your parents, uncles, brothers, etc. to critique you.

The second way is to invite a few classmates to critique each other.

The third way is to critique yourself. After each practice, nail the results to the wall, take a few steps back, and look at them from a distance. If small characters can be written evenly and straight, it is a good result. If large characters can be written steadily, not looking like they are about to fall, it is also a good result. You can also put the previous results side by side. Comparing them will clearly show whether there has been any progress.

Without saying much, you want to ask how to practice calligraphy during summer vacation to make progress easily? My answer is: everything depends on you. Whoever is willing to work hard will surely reap good rewards in the future. Time passes quickly. A month or so of summer vacation will pass in the blink of an eye. Work hard, children! Goodbye! Goodbye!

### Miscellaneous Notes on the World's Only Circus School

— Xin Ying

There is only one vocational school in the world that specializes in training circus performers. It is located in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, USA. Here, I will briefly write about the situation of that circus school below:

Establishment Process This circus school was established in 1927. The founder, William Schultz, is an expert in the art of circus and is proficient in martial arts. For more than ten years, he has put a lot of effort into the operation of this circus school, which has resulted in today's achievements. In addition to him, most of the teachers who teach various courses are also circus experts who have performed in circus troupes in the past and have been in the limelight.

Numerous Courses The courses taught in the circus school are also very diverse. Regarding the circus department, there are martial arts, rope walking, upside-down walking, etc. Other general courses, such as reading, writing, and arithmetic, are also quite emphasized. In terms of curriculum, it is completely in accordance with ordinary vocational schools, so subjects such as typing, home economics, and mechanics are also taught at the same time.

Training Period Most of the students entering the circus school are young children. After five years of rigorous training, they can become amateur circus performers. After two years of advanced training, they can become professional circus performers and be able to join a circus troupe to perform. However, over the years, not many people have been able to complete the advanced courses, and most drop out halfway.

Public Performance The school holds a circus performance every two years, scheduled for six days, with the aim of publicizing and attracting outside attention to the circus school. During the performance season, people from all over will travel from afar, and the scene is unprecedented, because the general public has long admired the students' acting skills in the circus school, so when they hear that there is a public performance, most people want to see it first.

Easy Employment Graduates of this school have been hired by circus troupes and have performed all over the world. Actors from circus troupes in various countries often write to the circus school, requesting to enroll for further study, but the circus school generally refuses due to customs, because all students of the school are limited to children from Manitowoc, and students from other places have never been accepted, which only makes those who aspire to do so sigh outside the door.

### Embarrassing Situation at the Opera

— Jun Mei

I recall a certain amateur performer, playing a Jing role, singing "Qionglin Banquet" with a Mr. Lu, who played a Xusheng role. On that day, the play was the finale, and friends and colleagues supported the show enthusiastically. When the performance reached the scene of making a ruckus in the mansion, Mr. So-and-so, playing Ge Denyun, came on stage. After sitting down with Fan Zhongyu, it was customary for Ge Denyun to sing the "Taishi Mansion" segment of the Yuanban first. As soon as the Huqin prelude finished, Ge Denyun completely forgot the lyrics and could not sing them. At this point, the musician had no choice but to play the prelude again as a remedy. Unexpectedly, at this time, Fan Zhongyu, seeing that Ge Denyun had forgotten the lyrics, and in order to smooth things over, besides saying "Taishi, Sir," proceeded to directly sing "I was originally." At this moment, Ge Denyun, reminded by the phrase "Taishi, Sir," also sang "Taishi Mansion" at the same time. As a result, one Sheng and one Jing spoke at the same time, and the audience burst into an uproar. Then, Fan Zhongyu, seeing that Ge Denyun had already sung, no longer followed with "a poor scholar." Who knew that Ge Denyun also had this intention and no longer followed with "set up a banquet," and again did not make a sound at the same time, and the entire audience became even more restless. The two gentlemen, in this embarrassing situation, actually lifted their robes and fled into the backstage. Fortunately, the members of the troupe were alert and quickly brought another actor on stage to calm things down. This kind of situation in the theater is rare, but speaking and stopping singing at the same time, thinking carefully about the comical situation at the time, I am afraid that no one would not smile silently.

### Zhao Jingshen and Du Zimei Co-compile "The Light of Women"

— Peng Hua

"The Light of Women" is a film adaptation of Ba Jin's trilogy "Family," "Spring," and "Autumn." This is a masterpiece in the Chinese literary world.

Most middle school and university students have read this novel, which shows that readers are fascinated by these three novels; at the same time, it can be seen how much readers love these three novels.

Before the war, the literary scholar Mr. Zhao Jingshen had long wanted to adapt it into a film script, intending to hand it over to Lianhua Film Company, starring Ms. Chen Yanyan. He had also obtained permission from the author, Ba Jin, but later, because they were busy with personnel matters, they were slow to start writing.

Now, he is using the summer vacation period and has already started writing with Mr. Du Zimei (according to Mr. Du, he is a student studying literature).

However, the plots of "Family," "Spring," and "Autumn" are very complicated. If the three are to be combined into one adaptation, wouldn't it be too long? This is a question worth considering.

This adaptation of "Family," "Spring," and "Autumn" is undoubtedly a blow to the current costume film "Folk Tales"! It can politely say to them: "You should step down"!

### Laurel and Hardy Forever Collaborate - An Agreement of Understanding Has Been Signed

— Yong

Laurel and Hardy, this number one comedic star duo on the screen; since their collaboration, they have indeed been highly praised by people all over the world. However, the news of their frequent breakups has been unsettling for the audiences who have always loved them. According to news from London, the occurrence of this matter is mostly due to the uneven script composition, and often in their films, Laurel occupies a more important position than Hardy.

Until recently, the two have cooperated again; and there is a trend of never breaking up again. It turns out that the two have reached an understanding and have also signed a legal-style contract. Although the contract does not stipulate a guarantee that the same shortcomings as before will not occur in their films in the future; but on the point of cooperation, a solid foundation has been laid; if either of the two is unwilling to cooperate, they will be subject to a large fine.

Following the changes of the times, the batches of red stars with brilliant light on the Hollywood screen today will eventually become silent one day. Taking this pair of comedic stars as an example, their acting skills will slowly diminish in the eyes of the audience. Therefore, in order to maintain their reputation in the future, in addition to the two of them should permanently cooperate, they also urgently need to improve their acting skills. The opinions of all circles are that they hope that their future films can have a large amount of self-created humorous lines.

Hawthorne's Cases

### The Ballerina's End

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Three: Conflicting Information

Hawthorne paid more attention and said, "Argue? Did you hear anything?"

Old Mao said, "Of course I couldn't hear what that Mr. Yu said, but I heard a few words from Miss Wang." "What did she say?" "She said, 'Yes, there is such a thing.'... 'Are you fit to manage me?'... 'Do you have the guts!'... 'Bullshit!'... At that time, the uncle happened to come back in from outside, and persuaded Miss Wang not to get angry, and Miss Wang slammed the receiver down hard, and went upstairs angrily."

Hawthorne's eyes became more solemn, and he said to himself, "That person cannot be underestimated. ... Brother Jinshou, we need to find him to talk."

Before Ni Jinshou could express his opinion, Old Mao rushed to say, "There is more. That is, when he and Miss Wang were arguing in this living room that day, some of the words they said were also terrible to hear."

Hawthorne said, "What words?" Old Mao said, "He was arguing with Miss Wang and that Mr. Zhao here. Although I didn't hear it completely, their voices were very loud and the situation was terrible. Later, the uncle persuaded Mr. Yu to go out, and he kept scolding people on the way: 'Heartless and ungrateful thing!... Okay, I'll teach you a lesson!' Sir, think about it, he is clearly at odds with Miss Wang. Now that Miss Wang has been beaten to death like this, who else but him could have done it?"

Hawthorne lowered his head again, as if estimating whether Old Mao's views were likely to be established. Ni Jinshou then took over and asked.

"Are your words all true?"

Old Mao resolutely said, "Not half a lie."

"Then, why did Jinmei just say you were talking nonsense?" (44)
