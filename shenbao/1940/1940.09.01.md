Before the war, China's imports of rice accounted for 3% of the national average annual production of 700 million dan. However, at present, Free China is not worried about rice shortages due to the good harvests of the previous three years. China still needs to do its best to produce sufficient raw materials to supply its hundreds of millions of people with clothing. Before the war, China's annual cotton production was 12 million dan, but half of the cotton-producing areas have fallen. Therefore, the Chinese government is currently improving cotton seeds in the southwestern provinces and opening 92 yarn mills in the interior to meet the needs. (Reuter's telegram dated August 31st)

Editorial

### Germany in the European War and the Far East

Inherited historical traditions, emotions ignited by grievances, further guided by different beliefs, and weighed against different interests, prevent people from reaching a consensus. This lack of uniformity is almost innate, even permanent. Germany has its own firmly held views, and Britain has its own firmly held views; it is their adherence to these views that leads to war. China, also at war, insists that national independence and freedom are essential; and that resistance is necessary when independence and freedom are threatened. However, beyond the limits of national independence and freedom, China believes that even if countries like Britain and Germany have different views, there is no need to insist on them; this is China's view. Under this view, China naturally hopes for an early end to the war between Britain and Germany; knowing that this hope is futile, yet still earnestly cherishing it!

Based on the views held by Britain, and applying them to Britain's attitude towards the Far East, we can easily list various events before today to illustrate its contradictions. Britain has its own reasons for excusing each contradiction; indeed, some of them should be excused.

Based on the views held by Germany, and applying them to the Far East, the situation is very subtle. Not only does each issue have more than one perspective, but even the same issue should be viewed differently at different times. As time progresses and opportunities shift, we firmly believe that Germany's views on everything in the Far East must also be evolving accordingly with time and opportunity. What we currently expect from this evolution is certainly not to expect action, as circumstances and constraints prevent this, at least for now; but rather how to express honest and clear indications from everything at present. Past events need not be discussed. The current situation is vastly different from the past: in the past, there was a need to wave flags and shout slogans, to promote momentum, hoping for victory without fighting, and also hoping to assist in wartime; currently, it is a real battle, facing life and death, rejecting anything that is not beneficial to combat, and certainly preventing anything that is harmful after the war. In the past, any aspect that weakened Britain slightly, or constrained its activities slightly, or shook its prestige slightly, was considered beneficial to Germany; currently, in the Far East, there is practically no nation or force that helps Britain because Germany does not compromise, thus effectively striking Germany, or helps Germany because of its sweet words and generous gifts, thus effectively striking Britain. Furthermore, even if Britain is struck in the Far East, it will not affect Britain's fighting power in the North Sea, the Mediterranean, or the Near East; that is, it will not help Germany's war against Britain in the slightest. What can effectively strike Britain, if anything, is not in the Far East. In the past, Germany had industrial and commercial interests in the Far East, which was part of the financial resources for Germany's manufacturing of airplanes and tanks, but it certainly did not rely on airplanes and tanks to enjoy these interests. Currently, these interests have been suspended due to the European war. As for the future, no matter the outcome of the European war, the Far East industrial and commercial interests, which do not need the protection of airplanes and tanks, are what Germany should strive to manage in any situation! What Germany should manage and can supply in large quantities, undoubtedly, is the independent, free, and recovering China, which is most suitable for both sides! In the past, Germany and France were opposed, and Germany certainly had conflicting interests with France, so there was no way to strategize against France. Currently, the situation is different. We do not believe that the Far East policy of France's Petain government is solely dictated by Germany. We sympathize with the Petain government and have high hopes for it, so we do not think that way. However, we always believe that whenever we hear news of the Petain government gradually making concessions in the Far East, the encouragement it receives is not enough to maintain its courage, and what can best encourage its courage is undeniably Germany. In the Far East issue, Germany creates opportunities for others without making honest and clear indications, and is also taken as an international tool by others. Why does Germany still not think that it is not entirely generous in giving others benefits!

We firmly believe that Germany's views on the Far East are evolving. As German journalists have repeatedly discussed in Shanghai and Chongqing, as Mr. Kordt of the Embassy discussed in Shanghai the day before yesterday, and as the articles in the recent Berlin "German People's Economic Journal" are based on, all give us good impressions and strengthen what we firmly believe. At the same time, we are still afraid that German personnel may make a misjudgment: during the war against Britain, it is easy to be misled by emotions and believe that everything that is unfavorable to Britain is beneficial to Germany, is what Germany is pleased with, and is what Germany is happy to approve. Examine the previous argument, and you will surely know that it is not so in the Far East issue!

### America to Send Naval, Land, and Air Forces to Strengthen the Defense of the Philippines; British-American Negotiations Achieve Satisfactory Results; Singapore Completes Defense Measures

Washington: Well-informed sources in military circles here reported last night that the U.S. Navy may soon dispatch more military aircraft, submarines, and even large units of naval and land forces to the Philippines as part of America's great national defense program. It is widely believed that President Roosevelt, after mobilizing half of the U.S. national defense forces, will order several small teams of the army to report to the islands for training there. The news that the United States is about to reinforce its land and air forces on the Philippine Islands coincides with Philippine President Quezon's recent call for enhanced defense of the islands. Some people here object to further fortification of the Philippine Islands, believing that the Philippine Islands are indefensible. However, observers have recently noticed a significant change, namely that the U.S. Navy circles in Washington believe that if the United States can actively increase the strength of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, the Philippine Islands are not indefensible. Interior officials stated last night that a decision on Philippine President Quezon's request that the Philippine Islands be allowed to participate in the U.S. military expansion program will be made within days. Military officials were unable to learn last night how many troops President Roosevelt will dispatch to the Philippine Islands, but said that naval and national defense forces will be sent there for training. The U.S. Navy is currently expanding its strength, increasing by 1,000 men per month since the middle of last year. It is widely believed that another 16,000 men are needed to reach a total of 50,000 men. Under the National Defense Force Mobilization Act, approximately one million men will be ordered to mobilize this week. (United Press telegram dated August 31st)

Singapore: Authorities here "to cope with the situation in the Far East" have rapidly completed the final defense steps, and this British imperial outpost may soon become an important U.S. naval base. Today, it has become a strong fortress. Coastal obstacles, such as private docks, pavilions, and swimming fences, which were originally intended to prevent sharks, have now been removed. The coastline has been covered with barbed wire, including the commercial district of Collyer Quay. Recent legislation stipulates that British expatriates must serve in the military, and many Britons have been drafted for military training, training five times a week, including Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings. The government has also implemented food controls, establishing a rice warehouse. All rice imported into Singapore from other ports must pass through this warehouse, allowing the authorities to maintain the purchase and storage of new rice. The government has also adopted allocation measures for the heavy transport of food exports, but strives to avoid hindering export trade. (United Press telegram dated August 31st)

Hyde Park: President Roosevelt declared yesterday that negotiations between the United States and Britain on obtaining British territories in the Western Hemisphere as U.S. naval and air bases are progressing smoothly. President Roosevelt said that he could not announce the content of the negotiations because of their complex nature. President Roosevelt said that there was no other fresh news other than the proposal to sell 50 old U.S. destroyers to Britain. As a result of British-American negotiations, the United States has obtained the right to establish a naval base in the Bermuda Islands. The establishment of the U.S.-Canada Joint Defense Committee will accelerate the U.S.'s efforts to obtain naval and air bases on the eastern coast of Canada. President Roosevelt and his spokesmen currently refuse to comment on reports that the United States is seeking to borrow the Singapore naval port as an outpost for the U.S. Far East Fleet. (United Press telegram dated August 31st)

Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Hull declared at an intelligence conference yesterday that there was no new news to report regarding the British-American negotiations on the lease of British bases.

### U.S. President to Immediately Order National Defense Forces to Undergo Training; Conscription Likely to Be Passed Finally; Army Department Personnel Discuss Tactics

Hyde Park: Roosevelt indicated yesterday that he will immediately issue an order to mobilize the National Guard to undergo one year of intensive military training. (United Press telegram dated August 31st)

Washington: The U.S. House Rules Committee yesterday voted to limit the debate on the conscription bill to two days, starting next Tuesday. According to the original bill, it has already been passed by the House. What is being discussed now is the part amended by the Senate. The House Rules Committee also decided yesterday to allow the House Army Committee to maintain the "industrial conscription" amendment, so that industry can be operated by the state in the event of a national emergency. The final passage of this bill, as well as President Roosevelt's signature, are expected to be completed by the end of next week. Twelve million Americans, aged 20 to 45, are likely to register for enlistment, of which 4.5 million are suitable for military service. Conscription may begin in mid-September and will proceed as quickly as possible. The Army Department currently plans to train more than one million people within a year. Army Department personnel, when referring to the training of soldiers, said that the U.S. military plan will continue to be based on "experimental" warfare and will not change, because Germany's victory in Europe is attributed to this tactic. Military scholars have made a detailed analysis of the French war report, and the conclusion is that the Germans have new technologies in modern warfare, but there is no surprising evolution in strategy. It is heard that Army Department officials are studying how to answer the general public and military personnel who advocate that the U.S. Army abandon its existing organization and adopt German methods. Army Department personnel believe that Germany's massive tank attacks and the use of fierce air bombing are not military innovations, and feel that the Germans' tactics do not have any new developments that are sufficient to defeat a well-equipped and powerful U.S. military. The U.S. defense plan, in light of the Battle of Argonne-Meuse in 1918, is based on an offensive approach. The U.S. Air Force has been training in concentrated attack techniques for several years. What the Air Force currently lacks is a sufficient amount of aircraft to engage in a large-scale aerial battle with German aircraft fleets. The situation with tanks, according to military experts and observers, is the same as with aircraft. The German attack merely advances with a massive amount of various types of tanks, but its strategy is still the old "charge" tactic, assisted by infantry and closely connected supply lines. This is the tactic that Germany used to defeat France. Each German attack unit is complete and self-sufficient, which is the same as the U.S. Army. These units were able to break through the Allied forces' attempt to cut off their quick connection with the main German forces on the northern border of France. The legendary attack tactics, improved by Napoleon, are of two types: one is "flanking" and the other is "breakthrough." Because the Allied forces' flanks are protected by various geographical factors, the ocean, and the Maginot Line, Germany adopted the ordinary breakthrough method. The demarcation lines of the French defense forces were too clear and lacked sufficient flexibility. As a result, they could not quickly deploy units to attack tanks to the front lines to resist the tank attacks, resulting in the collapse of the entire army. German infantry closely followed the tanks everywhere and occupied strategic areas. Once the famous Belgian Fort Eben-Emael was captured, it was possible to reach Belgian territory directly, and the Allied forces' route was also occupied by German infantry. The German army's capture of this fortress also employed old-fashioned tactics. (United Press telegram dated August 31st)

### London Raided Three Times in One Day, British and German Air Forces Engage in Fierce Battle, Eighty-Two German Planes Shot Down in the Past Twenty-Four Hours

London – The British Air Force achieved a great victory in the past twenty-four hours, shooting down eighty-two German planes (sixty-two yesterday, twenty this morning). After heavily bombing Berlin, it also defeated the elite pilots of the German "Yellow Nose" Messerschmitt fighter squadrons in a large-scale air battle over Britain today. The air battle took place over a city on the southeast coast of England. German planes began a savage attack at dawn. Twelve planes of its "Yellow Nose" squadron dived from all directions to attack barrage balloons, opening fire with incendiary bullets, causing several balloons to catch fire and fall. Anti-aircraft guns of all calibers opened fire. At least four Messerschmitts were shot down, and the German planes began to retreat towards the French coast. Not many hours after the British planes returned from bombing Berlin, German planes flew over various regions of Britain to continue their intense attacks. By noon, London had issued three alerts in a row. (Reuters, 31st)

London – Yesterday, hundreds of German planes (some say over seven hundred), in retaliation for the British Air Force's attack on Berlin, attempted to break into the center of London three times without success. British fighter planes also densely covered the sky, scattering the German squadrons. Aided by anti-aircraft guns, they shot down a total of fifty-three German planes. Fifteen British planes were lost. After the air battle, it was clear that the German effort to break through London's defenses had been crushed by London's anti-aircraft guns and fighter defenses. German bombers attacked London in batches from all directions, but only managed to approach the suburbs. When London issued the third alert yesterday, ten German planes were shot down in the London area. In the afternoon, a large squadron of German planes, estimated at over two hundred, flew over the southeast coast of England. Last night, incendiary bombs were dropped on the outskirts of London. It was reported that incendiary bombs were dropped on a hospital, but it is not known if they ignited. Judging from the sounds of explosions heard in the suburbs, German planes dropped high-explosive bombs larger than before. The three air raids on London between noon and 6:00 PM caused citizens to repeatedly take refuge in air-raid shelters. The authorities acknowledged that some people were killed.

It was reported that last night, in addition to the London area, eleven cities, including three cities in the Midlands and southeastern England, one city in southwestern England, and one city each in the northwest, northeast, and Wales, were also overflown by German planes. When London issued the third alert yesterday afternoon, twenty German bombers flying very high soon appeared. A group of British fighter planes attacked head-on, breaking through the German formation and cutting off several German bombers from the rest, and an air battle ensued. A Reuters reporter standing on high ground in the north watched the battle and saw a German plane in the clear sky trying to shake off two British fighter planes closely pursuing it. The British planes aimed and fired a barrage of guns. In a few seconds, the German plane was hit and crashed behind the trees in a burst of smoke. After a while, thick smoke rose from the area.

During the second air raid yesterday, fierce anti-aircraft fire and bomb explosions were heard in the area. The alert in the London area lasted fifty minutes. After the all-clear, residents thronged the streets in the suburbs to purchase goods in preparation for another air raid. During the second air raid, a fierce battle occurred over a city in the Surrey area. A German bomber was shot down, and three crew members parachuted out and were captured. Two of them were injured and taken to the hospital. Another German plane was severely damaged and is believed to have crashed before returning to its base. Twelve high-explosive bombs were dropped on a sparsely populated area, killing an old man and slightly injuring several others. (Reuters, 31st)

Berlin Suffers Heavy Air Raid

Berlin – Berlin suffered its most intense air raid today since the start of the war. Between 11:39 AM and 3:16 PM today, British planes dropped countless bombs on the city. After the all-clear, Berlin Police Chief Daluge, accompanied by several foreign reporters, inspected various parts of the city and declared that this air raid was the most vicious attack the German capital had suffered. The police chief said that the bombs dropped by the British planes and the damage suffered by the city were more severe than those of Thursday morning. This was the longest air raid in days. A large squadron of British planes invaded the city's airspace and suddenly penetrated the inner defenses. Anti-aircraft guns opened fire three minutes before the alert was issued. The British Air Force dropped countless bombs and incendiary bombs this time. Many parts of central Berlin and residential areas were hit by bombs. (United Press, 31st)

German Krupp Factory Bombed

London – British planes attacking Germany bombed the Krupp factory in Essen with high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs. According to the pilot leading the squadron, there were four large explosions and two smaller explosions after the bombs were dropped, followed by a large fire and then two more violent explosions. The pilots who bombed the Cologne oil refinery witnessed a fire on the ground. Another squadron of planes bombed the Duisburg power plant, also causing a fire. In addition, several other targets were attacked with success. Bombers operating in France repeatedly hit the Saint-Nazaire oil depot, causing several large explosions. Yesterday afternoon, British planes also attacked enemy ships at several locations, bombing fourteen fishing boats and one larger ship at an altitude of 1,000 feet. Bombs landed between ships and the docks in Wobendoff. Several minesweepers were also bombed in the ports of Danzig. (Reuters, 31st)

German Side Announces Air Force Results

Berlin – This afternoon's German military report stated that yesterday the German Air Force attacked airfields and barracks in England. Several bombs fell on the barracks in southern England. During the attack, British planes took off to engage, and fierce battles ensued many times. Last night, German planes attacked port facilities, armament factories, and oil depots at the mouth of the Thames in central England, causing several large fires. Last night, British planes bombed Berlin again, and several bombs fell in the working-class district, without significant effect. One civilian was killed and several were injured.

They claimed that among the dead pilots in a German plane destroyed in the sea here, one was as large as Göring and was covered with various badges. It is said that the body resembling Göring was not buried with the other three, and the body has been transported to London to further confirm its identity. (United Press, 31st)

European War Talks (1)

### Churchill: A Young Man's Romance

This European war has inadvertently reached its one-year anniversary on the 3rd of this month. The final victory remains uncertain. Dr. Butler, the president of Columbia University, once said, "This war is a world war. Whoever wins or loses will determine two civilizations, two ways of life, two forms of government, and the ideals of society. If the outcome is unfavorable to us, the global situation will regress for decades; if it is favorable to us, we can restore true liberalism and lead the world in progress and peace." To enable readers to deeply understand the true situation of this European war, this newspaper has successively published two translated works, "Background of the European War" and "True Record of the European War." However, modern total warfare involves a wide range and is very complex. The materials collected by reporters from various European and American countries are inexhaustible. This newspaper has selected the essence and translated it into more than twenty articles, with many photos attached, collectively titled "Conversations on the European War." The sources of these materials have either been preserved for a long time or just received. They are based on an objective attitude, directly and indirectly revealing the truth of the European war situation. The following is a preliminary disclosure of the catalog: the British section includes (1) Churchill's youth romance (2) British folk life on the eve of the war (3) Churchill's American mother; the German section includes (1) Hitler's destitute youth (2) An analysis of Germany's total mobilization in the past seven years (3) Germany's huge military expenditure (4) Hitler's triumph (5) Hitler's personal life; the French section includes (1) The day Paris fell (2) From Paris to Bordeaux (3) Tragedy in the Forest of Compiègne (4) The "Vichy Old Man's" dilemma; the other sections include (1) The current situation in the occupied areas of various countries (2) Espionage panic in European and American countries (3) The inside story of the fall of Norway (4) An overview of the Mediterranean war situation (5) "Altmark" attacked (6) Warsaw's last diary (7) The Czech's passive resistance (8) An Austrian writer's escape (9) Gandhi's letter to Hitler (10) An overview of America's war preparations. The translated articles will be published daily. If new materials are discovered, they will be inserted at any time so that readers can get a glimpse of the whole picture.

The following is the first article, describing the romance of British wartime Prime Minister Churchill in his youth. The so-called "Romance" is the transliteration of the English word "Romance."

Prime Minister Churchill, known as the "Iron Man" of Britain, came from a noble family. His ancestors and father held prominent official positions. His mother was the daughter of an American wealthy man, with a beautiful appearance and extraordinary talent. The family environment can be said to be wealthy. However, he did not have the habits of a rich young master. From childhood to adulthood to entering officialdom, he showed his extraordinary vitality, full of adventurous spirit, not avoiding dangers, and daring to take responsibility. He was indeed born with extraordinary talents, which ordinary people could not match.

In total, since he engaged in political life, he has been transferred to nine positions in the cabinet: he has been a member of the Conservative Party cabinet and also served as a member of the Liberal Party cabinet. Although there was a temporary retirement, he still maintained the spirit of progress and perseverance during his days in opposition, which is his unique feature.

He has been a journalist, writer, and military strategist. He came from a triple military background; his literary cultivation and achievements are unmatched by most politicians. Since Prime Minister Disraeli of Britain, Churchill is the only cabinet elder who can be famous for his writing. As for the wonderfulness of his daily conversation and the touchingness of his speeches, it seems that they were "taught by extraordinary people."

During the last World War, he commanded a large team of infantry on the French front line; and for a period, he was fascinated by military aviation and flew planes himself. After retiring from the army, he also took time to write and completed many volumes; the landscape watercolor paintings he made at the age of forty were admired by his family. His life is full of changes and his energy is abundant. He is indeed a "typical figure of the romantic imperialist" of Great Britain.

During the period when Hitler was working hard, the British executives were furious as if in a dream. Churchill, this "old loner", was "good at observing the situation". He was shouting there alone, and now his "prophecies" have all come true. He urged the government and the public to come out of the mountains and lead the ill-prepared British people to fight. He really reported to the country in time, but seeing the beautiful life and brilliant days he had spent in his youth, one cannot help but feel the contrast between the past and the present.

When Churchill was a child, his father followed the Duke of Marlborough to serve in Ireland, and he left when he was four years old. His mother was the daughter of New York businessman Jerome (see "Churchill's American Mother" later). In 1880, Churchill was seven years old and preparing to go to school. At that time, people said he was a "naughty child."

The first school he entered was Eton School, which imitated the British aristocracy. If there was a fault, whipping would come immediately. After two years of suffering, he looked forward to coming out early every day. Later, due to his weak health and frequent illnesses, in order to facilitate medical care, he transferred to a school run by two female teachers in Brighton. The atmosphere there was gentle and kind, which was completely different from the first school.

He entered Harrow School at the age of twelve. During the exam, he handed in a blank paper for the Latin test questions, but the principal finally allowed him to enter the school based on his general academic ability. Churchill recalled his situation in school and said, "My name is Spencer Churchill, and the first letter is S. My ranking is in the very back row, the third from the bottom. The last two dropped out of school due to illness. That was in 1887. My father, Lord Randolph Churchill, although he had resigned from the positions of Speaker of the House of Commons and Treasurer, still held power in the political world. Therefore, many visitors often stood on the steps of the school and watched me walk in a line; I often heard them whispering, 'What, he is actually the bottom of the school!'"

In school for a year, other students liked to read Latin and Greek, but he thought he had self-knowledge and only read English, so he laid a good foundation. Later, he was admitted to the Harrow School Army Class, and he thought that half of it was due to luck. He said, "We all know that we have to draw a map silently during the exam. When I was making the final preparations the night before, I wrote many map names on pieces of paper and put them in my hat, and then I took out a piece of paper with 'New Zealand' on it and desperately memorized the geography of New Zealand. The next day, the first question on the test paper was actually 'Try to draw a map of New Zealand'."

Churchill liked to play war games since he was a child. He collected as many as 1,500 toy soldiers, forming an infantry division and a cavalry brigade. One day, his father went to watch him command these toy soldiers to fight for twenty minutes. In the end, his father asked him if he was willing to join the army. Churchill immediately replied "willing". So these toy soldiers changed his life. Afterwards, his education was aimed at passing the entrance examination for the Army University in Sandhurst, and he finally entered the cavalry department of the school. He recalled his school life, except for winning a medal for fencing, most of it was ordinary.

At the Army University, he started learning everything again. The Latin, French, and mathematics that he had previously abandoned did not affect him. He regarded horsemanship as particularly profound and interesting. He advocated that a group of fathers and brothers, especially wealthy families, "should not give money to their sons, but give them horses." In the blink of an eye, it was graduation time again. Churchill, who had always been unable to escape the "bottom of the list", actually ranked eighth out of 150 students in this exam. In December 1894, he finished his studies and returned home, and was already qualified to serve as an officer.

The next short five years were uneventful, but it was an interesting center in his life, and everything he experienced was worthy of a variety of things. At the age of twenty-one, he joined the Hussars Cavalry and received training as a reserve officer. Various courses were several times stricter than when he was in school. He spent all day learning horsemanship: getting on the horse, getting off the horse, galloping, trotting, jumping over obstacles, and sprinting, without exception. Churchill originally loved horsemanship, and at this point, he felt even more happy.

The following spring, the Hussars Cavalry was preparing to fill the defense in India in the autumn, and the officers were given leave to handle miscellaneous affairs. Churchill had five good horses, so he used this period to play polo games. At that time, British political and business leaders regarded horse racing as a major event, and the lively situation stirred up the entire London. This was exactly what Churchill liked, and he went to almost every event and had a great time.

During this holiday, he learned a lesson. According to his own record: "At the end of a certain week, I was invited to attend the grand banquet of the Prince of Wales as a second lieutenant of the army, and I felt it was a great honor. I understood very well that I must attend on time, and my manners must be elegant and generous—in short, show all the virtues. Unexpectedly, when I arrived, the guests and hosts had already gathered in the living room, and the number of people seemed to be thirteen, except for me. Everyone knows that the royal family is unwilling to be careless about the number thirteen. The prince clearly refused to take his seat. He arrived on time at 8:30 as scheduled, and now it was twelve minutes before nine o'clock. In the large living room, standing this angry guest, on the one hand, came this young man who was looked at differently by others. I felt very embarrassed and could only stammer a few words, and gave a bow. The prince sternly scolded: 'Winston, don't they teach you to be punctual in your team?' I really felt very scared! The two of us walked into the restaurant side by side, and sat down with exactly fourteen people. Later, this kind-hearted prince said a few words to me to show his kindness, so that I felt relieved." From then on, he tried his best to maintain the virtue of punctuality.

The Hussars Cavalry, with 1,200 people, boarded a transport ship and set off from Southampton. It took twenty-three days to reach Mumbai.

Serving in the army in India, the salary and treatment were better than in the country, and the officers' food, clothing, and daily life were taken care of by servants. Churchill's team was stationed in Bangalore for three years.

In the winter of 1896, he was twenty-two years old, and his desire for knowledge was strong. He wrote to his mother for many history, philosophy, and economics books, and used the time to rest during the day to study diligently, chew on them, and humbly accept them for two years. Then he returned to the country for a three-month vacation. At this time, the Pazhtun tribesmen on the Indian border rebelled. He had long wanted to visit the war situation in person, so he asked his superiors to allow him to accompany the 3rd Brigade of the field army on the expedition, and also served as a military reporter for the London Forward Post. His mother also contacted the London Daily Telegraph and published his communications on schedule.

Churchill returned to Bangalore. At the station, he was stunned to find out that the journey to Nowshera (where the headquarters of the field army was located) was 2,028 miles. He thought to himself, India is so big! After taking the train for five days in the hot weather to the railway terminal, he took a 40-mile carriage ride to report to the headquarters.

The first time the British First Brigade clashed with the natives, forty officers and soldiers were killed or injured in one watch, and many horses were killed. The Second Brigade rushed to support.

The next morning, the Second Brigade began to fight, with about 1,200 people, and launched a fan-shaped attack in three routes. Churchill was assigned to the middle route and galloped to the farthest end of the valley. On the way, he led a team of Indian soldiers to attack a small village on the mountainside. He recorded the scene at that time as follows: "I handed the horse to the natives and led the Indian soldiers to climb the mountainside. The midday sun was scorching hot. Except for a few shots fired on the mountain, everything was still quiet. At around eleven o'clock, I suddenly wondered why I couldn't see our army. Two or three hours ago, the large team of 1,200 people was in progress, but now it seemed to have been swallowed by the valley. I was young and liked to be nosy, and I was afraid that something would go wrong. Sure enough, something went wrong!" Not long after, Churchill and a team of Indian soldiers were ordered to retreat. Suddenly, swords and bullets gradually approached, and the enemy came from top to bottom, and it seemed that they were about to reach the feet. Eight Indian soldiers tried their best to fire back, and as a result, two were killed and three were injured. Fortunately, an officer arrived with a few soldiers to help everyone rescue the injured soldiers. Churchill then described the situation at that time: "The officer was shot. The four soldiers under him carried him away. At this time, five or six Pazhtuns with large knives flashed out from the side. The four soldiers also ignored the wounded and rolled off the stretcher and fled. The leading Pazhtun rushed to the side of the stretcher, raised the large knife and quickly chopped the dying officer three or four times. Seeing this, I forgot everything and vowed to kill this bandit. I aimed and fired, one shot, no movement, two shots, no result, three shots, I don't know if I hit it, I only saw the native retreating three or four yards and rolling down from the rock. At this time, the sound of gunfire was still dense. I looked around, and I didn't see a single one of our own people, so I ran desperately, and bullets flew from all directions. I finally ran to a small hill. Our Indian soldiers had already occupied a low hill! After a while, I was with them."

Before long, the natives retreated. Our army was ordered to destroy the village huts and trees in the valley into a flat ground. Each time we attacked a village, we lost two or three British officers and soldiers, and fifteen to twenty Indian soldiers. After two weeks of fighting, we returned to the camp in triumph. That winter, I used the communications published by the London Daily Telegraph as a blueprint to write my first book. After Christmas, I sent the original manuscript to London, and my mother sold it to a bookstore for publication. It was called The Malakand Field Force, and it was very popular with readers.

### German and Italian Authorities Announce Resolution of Hungarian-Romanian Dispute; Axis Powers Guarantee Romanian Territorial Integrity and Inviolability; Romania Suffers Significant Territorial Loss and Economic Damage

Vienna - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, on behalf of the German and Italian governments, issued a declaration stating that the Romanian and Hungarian governments have appealed to the German and Italian governments for arbitration to resolve the issue of territorial cession to Hungary. Based on the promises made by the Romanian and Hungarian governments in their petitions, stating that both parties would consider any arbitration as the final solution without any reservations, the two foreign ministers, after discussions in Vienna with the Romanian and Hungarian foreign ministers, have arbitrated as follows: (1) The determined border between Hungary and Romania shall be divided according to the attached map, the detailed sections of which shall be determined freely by the Romanian and Hungarian governments. (2) Romanian troops must withdraw from the territory ceded to Hungary within two weeks, and the transfer must be maintained in good condition. The various detailed methods and procedures for withdrawal and occupation shall be decided immediately by the Romanian-Hungarian Committee. The withdrawal and occupation of both sides must be orderly. (3) Romanian citizens currently residing in the ceded territory will naturally become Hungarian citizens, but within six months they may petition to become Romanian nationals, but they must leave Hungarian territory within one year and be received by Romania. Their movable property and items converted from immovable property may be taken away. If their immovable property cannot be sold, the Hungarian government shall compensate them. The Hungarian government should handle various issues arising after withdrawal and occupation with a magnanimous and harmonious attitude. (4) Hungarian citizens currently residing in the land ceded by Hungary to Romania in 1919 may also petition to become Hungarian nationals within six months. The rights to which such repatriated persons are entitled are the same as those stipulated in the previous article. (5) The Hungarian government shall bear the solemn obligation to allow persons referred to in this arbitration to restore Hungarian nationality, and whether they are Romanians, they shall be given the same rights as Hungarian nationals. The Romanian government shall also bear this responsibility for Hungarian nationals of Romanian nationality who remain within Romanian territory. (6) Other issues arising from the transfer of sovereignty shall be negotiated directly by the Hungarian and Romanian governments. (7) If difficulties or doubts arise in the implementation of this arbitration plan, they shall be negotiated directly by Hungary and Romania. If they cannot agree on any issue, it shall be submitted to the German and Italian governments for resolution. (Haitong Telegram, 31st)

Vienna - After the Vienna arbitration case concluded, the German and Italian foreign ministers exchanged notes with the Romanian foreign minister, the content of which stipulated that the German and Italian governments would guarantee Romania's territorial integrity and inviolability. The Romanian government has accepted this guarantee. The territory ceded by Romania to Hungary is estimated to be 45,000 square kilometers. (Haitong Telegram, 31st)

Viking - After Romania succumbed to the ultimatum from the Axis powers, the first reaction here was one of shock, as Romania's deception over the Outer Transylvania incident was astonishing. Romania has lost land with 2.75 million residents, including 1.5 million Romanians and 1 million Hungarians, while Hungary has gained a huge mountain range extending into Romania. According to reliable sources, Germany has heavily concentrated troops in P沃尔 and along the Soviet border of occupied Poland. Well-informed sources in Romania now expect German troops to occupy several strategic locations in Outer Transylvania to prevent serious incidents. It is now known that Germany demanded that Romania accept its arbitration conditions, but did not notify its representatives of the arbitration method. There was fierce debate when the Privy Council was held, and it was heard that at least one participant claimed that if Romania succumbed without a struggle, a revolution might break out within the country. Romania's loss of Outer Transylvania is a major blow in terms of industry and economy, while Hungary has gained a very large wheat-producing area and the Beimeier gold mine. Most of Romania's western defenses will also be destroyed as a result. Romania's loss of South Dobruja is far more serious than what can be compared today. According to the Vienna Agreement, Romania must withdraw from the ceded territory within fourteen days. Details of the new border will be decided by the Romanian-Hungarian Mixed Committee. People in the Hungarian capital were greatly excited to hear about this agreement, and the absence of Soviet representatives at the Vienna Conference was a source of comment for people in the Hungarian capital.

### Germany Concludes Agreements with Hungary and Romania on Minority Ethnic Groups; Hungary and Romania Guarantee that German Nationals within Their Borders Enjoy the Same Treatment as Their Own People

Vienna - While the Hungarian-Romanian dispute was being negotiated here, Germany had concluded a draft agreement with Hungary on the future status of the German minority in Hungary. The draft has been signed and includes the German minority throughout Hungary, including the German minority in the territory arbitrated and ceded to Hungary. One of the most important points in the full text of the draft is that Hungary must grant the German minority the right to adhere to national traditions and recognize National Socialism. The German minority enjoys the right to organize associations, such as youth sports and cultural associations. Germans may serve in all sectors of Hungary and enjoy the same treatment as Hungarians. Germans may also be elected as officials based on the number of people in the minority. Children of Germans should receive the same education in German schools. Germans may use their native language in public gatherings and may not restrict German publications. In each administrative district where Germans account for one-third of the residents, German may also be used in official correspondence. Germans may use the names of their German families. The draft does not affect the obligation of the German minority to be loyal to Hungary. Special provisions are made for the German minority in the territory ceded by Romania to Hungary. Germans in this area may move to Germany and may submit this request within two years of signing the draft. They may take their movable property with them without restriction, and they may liquidate their immovable property in cash. All detailed programs will be negotiated separately by Germany and Hungary. (Haitong Telegram, 31st)

Vienna - The German-Romanian draft agreement on the future status of the German minority in Romania was signed here yesterday, the contents of which are as follows: "The Romanian government guarantees that the German minority in its territory enjoys the same status as Romanians, and promotes the status of the German minority in the spirit of the Carlsbad Resolution." (Haitong Telegram, 31st)

### Romanian Foreign Minister Resigns; Cabinet's Position Shaken

Romania - It was widely rumored here yesterday that Romanian Foreign Minister Manolescu had submitted his resignation after the Romanian-Hungarian agreement was signed in Vienna. It is believed that the Foreign Minister's resignation was a procedure to allow the Romanian cabinet to be reorganized. (United Telegram, 31st)

Romania - After the Axis powers sent an "ultimatum" to Romania and the arbitration was issued in Vienna, people here believed that there would be major changes in the Romanian government in an instant. It is believed that the Gigurtu cabinet has obviously been given by its pro-Axis policy. The Romanian people initially thought that their government would change its course and collude with the Axis powers to make profits, but today they feel betrayed. It is generally felt that even if the government is replaced and the peasant leader Maniu is appointed as the Prime Minister, it is now too late. Maniu talked with King Carol of Romania for several hours last night, but the official did not announce anything about it. The King of Romania and the ministers considered the conditions of the Axis powers overnight. The ministers seemed to have no choice but to resign and apologize for this "another huge sale by Germany". It is not impossible for Germany to occupy Outer Transylvania, as the Axis powers know very well that if Hungary immediately occupies the area, it may cause a fierce battle. Except for seeing the official report yesterday acknowledging that the civil organs in the Soviet-Romanian border area have withdrawn, the Romanian people are completely unaware of the Soviet-Romanian border incident. According to the latest news from the border, the situation has returned to tranquility, and the Soviet army that opened fire on the Romanian troops has returned to its original position. (Reuters Telegram, 31st)

### Romania Loses Power and Cedes Territory; Entertainment Suspended to Mourn

Romania - The Romanian authorities today ordered the suspension of activities in theaters, cinemas, concerts, and other amusement venues. The Kronstadt auto race has also been cancelled. (Haitong News Agency Telegram, 31st)

Romania - According to the semi-official "Telegraph Communications Agency," Romania has accepted the Vienna arbitration method and will begin the demobilization of troops in the near future. (Haitong Telegram, 31st)

### Hungarian Delegation Returns Home; Crowds Give Warm Welcome

Hungary - Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki and cabinet member Szaky have made great contributions to Hungary's acquisition of Outer Transylvania from Romania. Therefore, when they arrived here from Vienna last night, they received a warm welcome from the people. In addition to the Hungarian flag, the streets were full of German and Italian flags. The crowds gathered and demonstrated in front of the German and Italian embassies. According to the Prime Minister, Hungary's desire for compensation exceeded expectations. (Reuters Telegram, 31st)

### Italian Foreign Minister Postpones Return

Rome - The date of [Foreign Minister] Ciano's swift return to Rome is likely to be postponed due to ongoing discussions between the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy. (Haitong Telegraph, 31st)

Negotiations Between Romania and Bulgaria Still Have Details to Resolve

Sofia - According to well-informed sources here, the Bulgarian cabinet held a meeting yesterday to discuss the proposals made by Romania in the Romanian-Bulgarian talks, especially regarding economic issues. Although the compensation demanded by Romania has been reduced from 15,000,000 Bulgarian levs to 10,000,000 Bulgarian levs, the Bulgarian side still considers it too high. (Reuters, 31st)

Soviet-Hungarian Border Demarcation Conference to be Held

Moscow - News last night stated that the joint Soviet-Hungarian border demarcation committee will soon convene to begin planning the new border between Romania and Hungary. Each country will send two senior army officers and one diplomatic representative to participate in this committee. The meeting will be held in Moscow. (United Press, 31st)

### National Elementary School to be Established in Weining: Promoting Education for the Miao People, Currently Being Prepared for Opening This Year

(Guiyang Dispatch) The central authorities also believe that church education in Weining (a county in the extreme west of Guizhou) cannot be ignored. The central and provincial authorities have paid attention to and reformed the Shimenkan area, which has taken on a new appearance. In the Miao areas of Weining County, church schools still account for the majority. In order to promote education for the Miao people, it is heard that a national elementary school will be established in Weining. According to Yu Qiansheng, Chief Secretary of the Provincial Department of Education, "Mr. Guo Lianfeng, Section Chief of the Frontier Affairs Section of the Ministry of Education, returned to Chongqing after inspecting education in Weining. He believes that church education has several decades of history and a gradually consolidated foundation in the Miao area of Weining County, especially in the Shimenkan area, but its educational methods do not fully comply with regulations. Therefore, he suggested establishing a national elementary school. The Ministry of Education adopted this suggestion, sent a principal, and began preparations. The school is named 'National Weining County Central Experimental Elementary School,' a complete elementary school with both higher and lower grades, larger in scale than ordinary complete elementary schools. Preparations may be completed after the summer vacation, and it will open within the year. The establishment of this national Miao school is not only to promote education for the Miao people but also to conduct an experiment in frontier education. There are already more than 20 provincial Miao elementary schools in the Miao areas of various counties in this province, but they are still insufficient due to economic and other reasons. Now that the Ministry of Education is allocating funds to establish a national Miao school under very difficult financial circumstances, people in the educational circles of this province are also very excited."

### Food: Imported Rice Leaps to Ceiling Price; All Rice Soars... Food for People Becomes More Difficult

After two days of consecutive soaring prices for imported rice, the Rice Price Evaluation Committee, disregarding the rice inventory situation in Shanghai and accommodating the facts, only cared about protecting the interests of the goods owners, and did not ask about the difficulties of the public's livelihood. It specifically increased the price by two yuan, making speculators feel even more justified. Returned original packages are not within the limit, making it impossible to stop the price increase. For a time, everyone competed to buy and hoard, releasing and then collecting. Prices soared in an instant, all reaching the assessed price. In other words, they rose by two yuan. At the close, Grade One Chen Saigon and Siamese rice was 61.5 yuan, new pointed rice was 60.08 yuan, Grade Two was 59 yuan, and fire-refined rice was 61 yuan. The opening price for Grade Two Saigon rice was 68 yuan the day before yesterday, and 70 yuan was asked for later without success. Yesterday, the opening price was 71.5 yuan, then increasing from two yuan to two and a half yuan, which is a rise of four and a half yuan from the previously opened 68 yuan. Small-refined rice was 70 yuan, up 2.4 yuan, and Grade Two Siamese rice rose from 70.05 yuan to 72.5 yuan, also a rise of three yuan. It is estimated that more than 500 tons were traded. Apart from rice shops being nervous and competing to buy, most of it was absorbed by hoarders, and the total transaction volume was more than 13,400 bags.

As the arrival of glutinous rice was scarce, the sales market suddenly became active. Not only did cake shops and rice vendors prepare in advance due to the soaring rice market, but also large households hoarded it, creating a situation of supply falling short of demand. Goods owners all regarded it as a rare commodity, and customers did not flinch despite the high price. The selling price was as much as three or four yuan higher than the previous market. Jinli special grade was priced at 67-68 yuan, and Changdan goods also required 65-66 yuan, while Hong Kong special grade and domestic glutinous rice were both 67-68 yuan, ordinary was 65-66 yuan, and next to polished rice was 61-62 yuan.

The source of Guomi rice such as thick and thin Geng rice, apart from thin rice, has been exhausted from the inland reserves and has not arrived for a long time. Yesterday, only 600 bags of thick Geng and early rice arrived. With the sudden interruption of imported rice and the scarcity of domestic rice, the market sentiment became even stronger. The prices opened were accompanied by a violent price surge in other goods, with increases of two or three yuan. Common ordinary white Geng rice from Changxu has reached 72 yuan. As for fresh special goods, there were no samples. White Geng rice from Suzhou and Kunshan in Changzhou was priced at 70 yuan, down to 66-67 yuan. Fresh original-packaged early rice from Fugang also opened above the 70 yuan mark, with the bushel seeing 66.5-66 yuan.

As the new Jing rice from Zhoupu is still limited in supply due to the erratic autumn rains, there are only 35 dan, and the demand from customers is even more urgent. Therefore, it is difficult to cope with the limited market goods, and only a few dan are distributed to each. The opening price also rose sharply by about two yuan, to 66.5-66 yuan. In short, there is no exception to the price surge in the market, which is a misfortune for people's food.

### Flour Prices Also Aroused

Yesterday, the flour market was aroused because the price of rice exceeded the limit. Speculators buying and hoarding futures of Phoenix brand flour from Japanese mills were endless, with transactions reaching more than 10,000 bags. The opening price for September was 14.9 yuan to 9.5 yuan, and for October was 15.1 yuan to 1.5 yuan, a further increase of one jiao compared to the previous day. However, the price of Huafen factory was stable and did not move. Imported flour was 16.4-5 yuan, and domestic flour was 14.7-8 yuan. There was no shortage of spot supply, but actual sales were not strong. The market can only stand firm.

Wheat: Yesterday's transactions had nothing particularly exciting to say. Because it was difficult for Huafen factory to purchase, there were no large-scale purchases except for occasional scattered additions. Japanese factories were still unwilling to lower prices to absorb them, and the sellers mostly stayed put in the face of scarce arrivals and rising prices. As a result, Sanxin factory and others still purchased more than 3,000 bags of wheat from each car and boat, priced at 21.5 yuan to 21 yuan.

### Oil Cake: Soybean Oil Source is Connected; Raw Oil Abandoned Road Goods; Total Number is No Less Than 20,000

The oil market is completely manipulated by speculation. At the moment, the source of soybean oil has been connected, and market sentiment has suddenly declined. The market price immediately announced a decline. The road goods abandoned by raw oil have not yet arrived. Most traders think there is still business to be done, so the market wind has turned upward again. However, recalling that the original factory abandoned road goods, the total number is no less than 20,000. According to the sluggish sales market now, the future changes may be greater than the ups and downs of soybean oil. Yesterday, a total of 50 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded, priced at 97 yuan to 97.5 yuan. 500 dan of Dayouyu factory soybean oil were mostly returned transactions, priced at 75 yuan to 74.5 yuan, and 150 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were priced at 62.5 yuan. The total transaction volume from the first half of September to the second half of October was 600 pieces, and the prices all opened at 62 yuan.

Because market sentiment was weak, once the plucking wind started, followers were endless. The morning market hardened at first, a fleeting moment, and soon started to settle on its own. Following this, due to the urgent needs of speculators and foreign firms, although foreign firms such as British and American firms were willing to fill in, the price was surprisingly soft due to the shortage of position.

### Jin Shurong's Commentary

— Sheng Kaiqiong

Why is the Foreign Exchange Tightening?

The black market exchange rate of the legal tender has been declining for the past two weeks, with the US dollar falling from above 5.59375 yuan to below 5.5 yuan, seeing 5.28125 yuan at the end of the month; the English gold has also decreased from 3 pence and 70125 to 3 pence and 59375. The market price of gold has also been drastically increased to beyond 6,200 yuan.

It seems that the basic factors affecting the exchange market stem from the tense situation in Vietnam, while the rumor that the Ministry of Finance will revise the commercial exchange rate can only be regarded as a rumor. Since the Ministry of Finance formulated the commercial exchange rate in 1939, export merchants have repeatedly requested the Ministry of Finance to abandon the 7-pence commercial exchange rate and revise it to a price closer to the black market level. However, the authorities believed that if it approached the black market, there would inevitably be frequent fluctuations and inconsistent rises and falls. Once the commercial exchange rate is close to the black market, it will be revised from time to time, which is not beneficial to export merchants, and it will hinder the work of the state in controlling export trade and collecting export foreign exchange. Therefore, it was finally set at 7 pence for more than a year. However, after a year, the exchange rate of 4 and a half pence was re-established according to the results shown by the statistical figures and the changes in the environment. The situation of the 4 and a half pence exchange rate for export trade and foreign exchange collection has not yet been discovered from the statistics, and there have been no major changes in the environment. To say that the commercial exchange rate will be changed to 3 pence is an overreaction! It should be known that although the commercial exchange rate can be changed at any time, "at any time" is subject to conditions. The most important thing is to know for sure that it hinders export trade and foreign exchange collection before it can be changed at any time.

As for the situation in Vietnam, the market has repeatedly spread rumors that the Japanese army is preventing landings in Shanghai, but the Japanese army has not yet stepped on Vietnamese soil. At the same time, at present, the basic policy of the Chinese government, apart from hoping that Vietnam will not be used by Japan, is to resist aggression, so it is only deploying troops on the Vietnamese-Yunnan border and adopting a policy of regardless of the attitude of the Vietnamese government, if the Japanese army enters Vietnam, then China's war of anti-aggression will occur in Vietnam. Although the situation in Vietnam is serious, it is not yet known what the benefits and harms will be for China. Speculators purchased August futures at prices above 3.8 pence and around 6 yuan in July. At the time, they took advantage of the revision of the commercial exchange rate and the issue of the Shanghai garrison to profit. Now they want to take advantage of the situation in Vietnam to pluck in foreign exchange, hoping to make a fortune from the country's difficulties due to unfavorable developments in this regard.

### Since the Highest Price Was Discovered in May and Has Fallen Back, Yesterday's Gold Price Was About in the Middle — Highest Seen at $6,220 —

Yesterday, cash "heated red" (a term for gold speculation) trading in the unofficial market saw a resurgence of buying, with high prices repeatedly emerging. The closing price had already exceeded the $6,200 mark. Given the tight exchange rates reported, operators would not willingly give up this bullish opportunity and increased their purchases, which had been prepared for some time. Although some profit-taking and liquidation of long positions occurred, the impact was still slight. It is noted that on May 6th of this year, the gold price had reached a high of $7,250. Subsequently, due to the tension of the European war and the ceasefire in the Netherlands and Belgium, a sudden reaction arose, and the price gradually fell back to $4,910 by July 5th. Yesterday morning, the market opened at $6,060. Securities firms and gold dealers took the lead in pushing the price up to $6,120. Later, money changers released some holdings, causing a slight drop of $20 or $30. Subsequently, news of tight foreign exchange rates spread quickly, and banks and gold dealers aggressively raised prices, soon reaching a peak of $6,220. At that time, retail investors and others entered the market, and the buying momentum was quite strong. Before the close, there was a slight setback, but the result was still a closing price of $6,210, a substantial increase of $175 compared to the previous day. If considering the drop from the highest price discovered in May, yesterday's gold price was in the middle. In the afternoon, there was no Wednesday market, but half-day trading was still brisk, with about 4,000 taels traded. Silver jewelry shops finally raised prices by $10, while customs gold and other types remained unchanged.

"Heated Red" Rises by $175

Since the morning, the market sentiment for each "bar" (ten taels) was quite good. Gold dealers took the lead in raising prices and buying, with money changers taking in 50 taels at $6,060, $25 higher than the closing price from the day before yesterday. Subsequently, due to the tight foreign exchange rates, the buying interest became stronger. Securities firms and banks competed to absorb holdings, and the price immediately rose by $60. Securities firms took in 10 taels at a high of $6,120. Suddenly, money changers came to sell short, and the price once dropped back to $6,090. After that, the buying momentum resumed, with gold dealers and banks again scrambling to acquire holdings. Moreover, Hong Kong firms were also active in the market, leading to another rise of $90. Gold dealers took in 30 taels from securities firms, raising the price to $6,180. Later, as the foreign exchange market stopped tightening and tended to stabilize, a temporary pullback occurred. Gold dealers and banks came to sell, causing the price to fall back to $6,135. Around 11 a.m., news of a tightening foreign exchange market spread again, and the buying momentum on the trading floor revived. Banks absorbed holdings aggressively, breaking through the $6,100 mark and reaching a high price of $6,120. At noon, a certain money changer with a short position increased their holdings at the high price, causing a drop of $30. However, due to the excitement of retail investors, the closing price was still $6,210, resulting in an increase of $175 compared to the previous day. After the close, news suddenly spread that an American warship had sailed to the Pacific, causing considerable selling pressure. Gold dealers and banks intervened, and the price finally retreated to $6,140. In the afternoon, the situation outside the market was still stable, and transactions were made at $6,170. The fluctuation was $160 in half a day. The selling price of cash gold by gold dealers was more than ten dollars higher than "heated red," while the buying price was more than thirty dollars lower. Currently, margin gold is quoted $50 or $60 lower than the listed gold price, and there is little trading activity.

Jewelry Gold Raises by $10

At the beginning, the jewelry gold quoted by Da Tong Hang was still $620 per tael for sales. Around 10 a.m., it was raised by $10, and there were no further changes. Da Tong Hang changed its quote to $630. The quote of the Xin Tong Hang was similar to that of Da Tong Hang, and the buying price was about $30 lower.

### British and American Gold Pounds Surge by $4

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a resurgence of the "heated red" rise. British and American gold pounds surged by $4 each. There was still demand for British gold notes, and the market price rose slightly. The price of American gold notes once reached a high of $18.84, but later, due to rumors of an American warship sailing to the Pacific, it fell back to $18.70. In the afternoon, it rose again to $18.78, ultimately increasing by $0.36. There was considerable demand for Hong Kong notes, and the price increased by $0.05. In addition, there was also demand for Singapore notes and notes from Annam, Lobi, Canada, and the Philippines, and the market prices all rose in unison. The rise in Japanese gold notes had not waned, and the market price continued to advance. The evening market reached a high of $1.82, a further increase of $0.07 compared to the previous day. The demand for Korean notes was also strong, and the evening market continued to rise to $1.14.

### August Exchange and Deposit Interest Rate

—$4.50 per Thousand— The Shanghai Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee has set the interbank exchange deposit interest rate for August at $4.50 per thousand (equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 4.5%), a decrease of $1.50 compared to July.

### Hidden Marks on the Face of the New Chinese Dime Notes

The designs of the new dime and nickel subsidiary currency notes issued by the Bank of China have been described in detail in this newspaper. It is noted that the dime notes printed by the Bank of China this time have good paper, excellent printing, and all have hidden marks. The following is a brief description: On the front of the dime note, on the right side of the Temple of Heaven in Beiping, there is "1940" on the trees. On the left and right steps of the Temple of Heaven, there are the four characters "中國銀行" (Bank of China). On the front of the nickel note, on the right side of the Great Wall, in the middle of the city wall mountain, there are the characters "中國銀行" (Bank of China), "大東唐霖坤彫刻" (Datong Tang Linkun Engraving), and "TLK". On the mountain ground outside the city, there are the characters "1940" and "TLK".

### Securities: The Rise in Domestic Debt Continues Vigorously

The rise in the securities unofficial market was fierce yesterday. Various types of securities have broken through the highest prices seen on July 16th and 17th, including interest. Investor sentiment was enthusiastic, and inventory was depleted. For a time, there were no sales from the warehouses, and sellers had no goods to deliver, so they negotiated with the buyers to borrow. This situation was initially discovered and was exploited by the bulls. Those with ample funds felt that the opportunity was rare and continued to absorb holdings. Although gold repeatedly soared, the debt market was not affected. Bulls increased their holdings, and shorts covered, leading to a flurry of activity. It can be seen that the fundamental reason is that large investors are increasingly enthusiastic, so the prospects for the debt market are still inevitably progressing with the times. The opening yesterday morning was flat. Tongkang, Lianhe, and Hengfu bought, and Xinfu liquidated slightly. Later, Dakangcheng suddenly had a large intake, and the market price turned from weak to firm. In the afternoon, buying interest surged. Tongkang and Lianhe continued to buy, and Shuntai, Hongda, and Lianyi also absorbed holdings vigorously. Yichang, Xinchang, and Tianfeng also had strong demand. Among them, bulls increased their holdings more often, and shorts covered less often. Hengkang and Yongkang either bought A and sold E, or bought A and sold C, choosing to profit. Jiufeng and Yitai still sold. Type C broke through the $3 mark, Type B broke through $6, Type A broke through $2, and Type E also approached $3, the new high price after the interest payment, breaking through the highest price including interest in July, a thriving and promising situation, truly the best atmosphere in recent months. The market price ended up rising by several dimes to about a dollar. Type D was not traded in the afternoon, so it only rose by $0.15. The total number of transactions was $1.5 million to $1.6 million. A simplified table is listed below.

Stock trading: 50 shares of Bank of China stock were traded at a price of $65.50.

London, 30th (Friday) telegram: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks were stagnant, and there were no changes in the market.

### Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Is Heavily Burdened and Difficult to Recover; Inventory Is Thick and Outlets Are Blocked

The yarn market is still in a state of hovering, with a mediocre trend. Although the foreign exchange rate has been seen to fall, the yarn market has not been able to rise with it. This is because inventory is thick, and transportation is difficult and slow. The outlets for yarn sales have been greatly affected, so people's hearts are seeking stimulation, and the market is in a hesitant state.

The opening of current yarn this morning was calm, because yarn sales were very narrow, and long positions continued to be sold. The opening price for 20-count Shuangma was $960. Subsequently, news of a shrinking US exchange rate and soaring gold spread, and speculators became active again, unanimously scooping up holdings, rising from $960 directly to $972. However, although the shouting on the floor was tense, there were still few new buyers. In fact, the sales market was lacking, and the price fell again to $970.05 at the close. It is noted that the statistics for half-day transactions totaled 1,955 bales. The market for 20-count Shuangma fell by $5. Today, 330 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each guild is listed as follows:

### Jardine Matheson Cotton: Hongzhang Alone Takes in 100 Pieces

The current cotton situation has entered a cooling-off period again. However, although exchange rates have shrunk, factories, due to the blocked sales outlets for yarn, are particularly cautious about purchasing raw materials, so the cost is not strong. However, some people have their minds set on rising prices. The condition of new cotton is quite good. Today, only Hongzhang Factory took in 100 pieces of Jardine Matheson cotton at a price of $208 delivered to the factory.

Another report on the market price of foreign cotton: The New York cotton market, at the beginning of the morning, first due to purchases by speculators, and later due to the firmness of Wall Street and the purchases of the New Orleans futures market, resulted in a closing price increase of five or six pounds over the previous day. India yesterday, together with forecasts, rose another 3.5 rupees.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai yesterday was again active. Both Chinese and Japanese manufacturers have the intention to purchase, because the factory's inventory is not very abundant, and orders for Indian and American cotton have been placed with foreign firms for a long time. Currently, the war risk rate is extremely high, and there is talk of paying the full amount of the goods immediately after the order is placed. It is difficult to say on what day the goods will arrive at the port in the future. Therefore, factories are searching for holdings in the market, and the market situation has suddenly become active. According to this situation, the spot price will be very active.

### Piece Goods: Many Obstacles; Cotton Cloth Freight Transportation Is Intermittent

The cloth market is externally loose and internally tight. The sharp rise in gold has greatly stimulated people's hearts, but the loading of goods on various routes is intermittent, with many obstacles. Inventory is congested, causing people's hearts to become confused again, so the price of goods rises and falls suddenly, presenting a hovering situation. As a result, each piece increased slightly by $0.20. Although the road transportation on this street is open on both routes, the quantity is strictly limited. The Cantonese and Hong Kong guilds and the Nanyang guilds have slightly increased their demand due to exchange rate relations. Yesterday, they handled more than 300 pieces of bleached cloth, coarse cloth, colored cloth, and twill. The Zhejiang guild handled more than 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. The Yantai guild handled more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth, etc. More than 600 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street.

Due to the sluggish sales of East cloth, the mid-range fine cloth continued to fall by about $0.25 per piece. However, due to the frequent rise in gold prices, the trading mood of retail investors was still lively. Therefore, the market for Longtou fine cloth reached a peak of over $32.80, and the closing price was $32.70, an increase of $0.20 compared to the previous day. Sijunzi Serge was at $0.9325 per yard, stable with no gains or losses.

Piece goods exports: 225 pieces were shipped to Weihaiwei on the 31st, 95 pieces were shipped to Yantai, and 170 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Continues to Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market saw a further tightening of foreign exchange rates, so foreign sugar continued to rise. The guild's clearing prices: Grade 4 coarse white, arriving on June 10th, was $77.98, Grade 7 arriving on July 31st, was $78, an increase of $0.50. Transit goods newly arrived were $63 to $63.50, an increase of $0.50. Dutch "Chimei" (a brand) for delivery on September 6th was $64, for delivery on September 27th was $63.30, an increase of $0.50. Taikoo B Grade "Che Bai" (a type of white sugar) was $77, an increase of $1. DY Grade was $73.40 to $73.80, an increase of $0.80. HX Ka was $73.60, also an increase of $0.80.

### The French Concession Authorities Suddenly Implemented Strict Precautions Yesterday, Launching a Full Military Force to Patrol and Search, with Temporary Obstacles Placed on Important Streets

Yesterday, the French Concession Police Department suddenly took special precautions, causing the atmosphere in the French Concession to become tense. All detectives of the French police were ordered to go out and guard important sections of the roads, closely inspecting pedestrians and vehicles. Patrol teams and armored vehicles also patrolled the roads all day long. The French defense forces were also mobilized yesterday. In addition to assisting the French police in maintaining law and order, they were stationed in the fortresses on the roads, armed with live ammunition, and were on extremely strict alert. Regarding this special precaution, a senior official of the French Concession Police Department said, "We are fully prepared for anyone who disturbs the peace in the French Concession." The official stated that they do not believe that any extraordinary events have occurred or are about to occur in the French Concession. He said that this precaution is merely a customary public matter for the Police Department.

Central and Western Districts Are the Most Strict

Yesterday's precautions in the French Concession were most strict in the central and western districts. Near the Lujiawan Police Station, along Avenue Dubail, Rue du Père Robert, Avenue Dubail, and Route Conty, the situation was visibly tense. A large number of detectives were stationed at the intersection of Rue du Père Robert and Avenue Joffre, and an armored vehicle was parked there. More than a dozen policemen, armed with pistols and submachine guns, were stationed at the intersection of Avenue Dubail, posing as if they were about to shoot. An armored vehicle was stationed at the intersection of Avenue Dubail and Rue Tenant de la Tour. More patrolmen were stationed along the intersections of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Koukuei. Even on roads that were not important within the concession, there were mobile teams patrolling and guarding, closely searching suspicious pedestrians and vehicles. The French defense forces assisted the detectives at all times in maintaining law and order.

Shops and Alleys Are Searched Separately

The barbed wire obstacles that had been moved to the side of the road after the "August 13th" special precautions were moved to the center of most roads in the French Concession yesterday, leaving only two small gaps for pedestrians and vehicles to pass through, and were prepared to be blocked at any time. In order to prevent activities that disrupt law and order, the French Concession police authorities carried out strict searches everywhere yesterday. At 10 am yesterday, detectives were densely distributed along Route Américaine and Rue du Père Robert, searching door-to-door in the alleys and shops, which lasted for a long time. It is understood that no one was arrested.

### Dutch Residents in Shanghai Celebrate the Queen's Birthday: Consul-General Delivers a Speech Praising Anglo-Dutch Cooperation

According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, Dutch residents in Shanghai commemorated the sixtieth birthday of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands today (the 31st). Due to the current national crisis, the celebrations were not extravagant. The Dutch Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. P. Sitsen, delivered a radio address to the British community via the China Press radio station, emphasizing the unwavering unity of the Anglo-Dutch alliance. He stated, in brief: "Allied with Britain and other friendly nations, the people of the Netherlands around the world are celebrating the sixtieth birthday of our Queen Wilhelmina today. I take this opportunity to express the sentiments of the Dutch community in Shanghai. We feel that our Queen, for the sake of democratic ideals, has willingly left the country despite great hardship. The British and Dutch people, cherishing democracy, are strongly united and abhor totalitarianism and its crimes against civilization. Our monarch and royal family have been treated with great kindness in Britain, for which all Dutch people are deeply grateful. Connections, both ideational and material, unite Britain and the Netherlands. We deeply believe that we can eradicate violent oppression. The heartfelt gratitude of the Dutch people towards Britain is the strongest link between our two nations. The Netherlands has previously fought alongside Britain for shared principles, and now we are united again with Britain to fight for democracy, freedom, and the survival of civilization. We are extremely proud of this, and pledge to do our utmost."

### Concern for Chongqing Bombing Victims: Shanghai Residents Donate Funds for Relief, To Be Allocated by the Air Raid Relief Center, and Send Telegrams of Condolences to Victims in Chongqing

Since Japanese warplanes frequently bombed Chongqing, causing widespread destruction, the homes in bombed areas have been reduced to ruins and residents have been displaced. However, the spirit of the citizens remains resilient and inspiring. Various circles in Shanghai sent telegrams to Chongqing to express their condolences. Now, to actively assist the victims, they are donating funds to be remitted to Chongqing, showing their deep sympathy. The Chongqing Air Raid Relief Joint Office recently received multiple donations from various circles in Shanghai and has already allocated them for relief and post-disaster arrangements. Mr. Xu Shiying, the director of the office, is deeply grateful to the various circles in Shanghai for their generous donations and joint participation in this righteous cause, and has sent telegrams to Shanghai to express his gratitude.

### Customs House Hoists Warning Ball: Hurricane Rapidly Approaching Shanghai; Direction Change Possible, Decision Today

The direction of the new Pacific typhoon is being closely watched, as reported yesterday. It is now reported that the new hurricane has passed the Ryukyu Islands and is rapidly approaching the South China Sea. According to a report received yesterday by the Customs House from the astronomical observatory, it has reached 25 degrees north latitude and 121 degrees east longitude, with a wind force ranging from 60 to 120 nautical miles. The wind direction is north-northwest and north-west. Observing the astronomical typhoon chart, it has reached the waters off Fuzhou and is now fiercely advancing towards Dachen Island. Shanghai is likely to be hit. Therefore, at 2:40 PM yesterday (Customs House time), the Customs House hoisted a black ball, the hurricane warning signal, on the flagpole atop the clock tower, warning ships in the Huangpu River to take precautions. According to maritime personnel, if the wind direction does not change, there is a risk of reaching Shanghai today. The Taikoo Haijiang and Jardine Matheson Fao Shing, originally scheduled to depart today for Hong Kong, will depend on the wind conditions today to determine if they can depart on time. Additionally, the American President Lines President Pierce, arriving from Hong Kong, and the new Java Mail Line ship Tjitaroem, are expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning (the 2nd). The two companies made no statement yesterday as to whether this hurricane would affect their arrival dates. A definite time will be known tomorrow morning.

### Japanese Warships Blindly Shell Shipu Again: Investigation into the Bombing of Biejing

According to reliable shipping sources, on the morning of the 30th of last month, at approximately 7:00 AM, a Japanese warship anchored off the coast of Shipu blindly fired five shells towards the Shipu coastal area. The warship then left southwards, its destination unknown. In addition, regarding the bombing of Biejing by eight Japanese warplanes on August 16th, the following investigation reveals the extent of the damage: Houses damaged or destroyed, include: the Customs House, Wang Guangyuan & Co., Huang Yida Cloth Shop, the Biejing branch of the Local Bank, Yuan Zeng Money Exchange, Yangfu Temple, Ruiping Shipping Bureau, and Yuan Yisheng's house under Fangyan on the south bank of the Yangtze River (hit by three bombs and completely destroyed). A total of over 300 houses were destroyed, and over 20 civilians were killed and 40 or 50 were injured. The bombing locations were all non-military. The long-distance telephone bureau's telephone lines were also destroyed in the bombing, disrupting telephone service. Mr. Tao Wenhan, an employee of the bureau, immediately set out to repair the long-distance telephone lines after the Japanese planes left, and service was quickly restored.

### Ningbo Grain Price Stabilization Donation Drive Ends: Grain Shortage Gradually Easing

The Ningbo Association in Shanghai's emergency grain price stabilization donation drive for the Ningbo region has concluded, with a total of over 1.35 million yuan raised. The collection of donations pledged by various households is underway. The association will order the shipment of foreign rice to Ningbo once shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo resumes. However, according to reports from Ningbo, the new harvest has entered the market locally and the grain shortage has already eased.

### Shanghai and Hong Kong Prepare for Resumption of Shipping Lines: British and French Begin Negotiations; Xijiang Arrives in Haiphong and Sails for Saigon Within Days; French-Japanese Negotiations Anticipated by Germany and Italy

Since the temporary suspension of shipping lines between Shanghai and Vietnam was announced, British merchant ships in Shanghai have ceased sailing to Haiphong, instead sailing to Hong Kong and Haikou. However, according to well-informed sources, shipping between Shanghai and Haiphong is expected to resume shortly.

British and French Negotiations: Once shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam is disrupted, not only merchants and passengers are inconvenienced, but the shipping companies also suffer losses. British interests in both Hong Kong and Shanghai are further affected. According to foreigners, British authorities have begun negotiations with the French regarding the resumption of shipping between Hong Kong and Vietnam. Both parties are currently in the process. It is believed that a resolution can be expected in the shortest amount of time. If shipping between Hong Kong and Vietnam resumes, then shipping between Shanghai and Haiphong can naturally proceed unimpeded.

Transfer of the Governor of Vietnam: Shipping industry sources have learned recently that Haiphong is as peaceful as ever, as is French Indochina. People are generally optimistic about the future of Vietnam, believing that it will not be as dire as outsiders expect. The French-Japanese negotiations will surely progress smoothly, as Germany and Italy are well aware of the matter. As for General Decoux, who was newly appointed as the Governor of Vietnam in July, he has always advocated a strong stance in resolving the Vietnam issue, but has now been ordered to transfer to the position of Governor of the Leeward Islands. However, Decoux's transfer does not affect Vietnam's status, as the focus of the French-Japanese negotiations has long shifted to Vichy for discussions.

Mail Still Being Sent: After the temporary suspension of shipping to Haiphong, for mail destined for various southwestern regions via Haiphong, it is confirmed that heavy items have been temporarily suspended, and the post office will forward those suitable, while all registered, express, regular, and ordinary mail will be temporarily sent via Xiamen by the Shanghai Postal Administration. Therefore, although shipping to Haiphong is interrupted, mail service is not affected.

Xijiang Arrives in Haiphong: The French mail ship Xijiang safely arrived in Haiphong on the 30th and has been decided to sail for Saigon within the week. Company authorities stated that if any problems arise in Vietnam, the company will surely receive a telegram from Vietnam, but as of yesterday, no emergency telegrams have been received, so the situation in Vietnam is expected to remain unchanged for the time being.

### Paul Hémery's Injuries Fully Recovered: Has Left the Hospital and Returned Home

According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, Lieutenant Paul Hémery, Deputy Commissioner of the French Concession Police, was ambushed on the morning of August 17th and shot twice during an exchange of fire with six assailants. He was admitted to the Hopital Sainte Marie for treatment, and his injuries have fully recovered. He was discharged from the hospital this morning (the 30th). Hémery's injuries are said to be quite satisfactory, and he only needs to rest at home for a few days to fully recover. At the same time, the French police are continuing their investigation into this ambush, but it is said that no leads have been found yet. According to an official from the French police, there is no definite reason to believe that the case was politically motivated.

### French Concession Increases Land Tax: Property Owners Dissatisfied; Another Meeting to Discuss Reasons for Opposition

According to the Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, an official of the French Concession Council stated that the new land tax, decided by the Council in December 1939, has been implemented. The official stated that landlords throughout the French Concession received a 21-day advance notice regarding this decision, to allow them to consider their responses. Some landlords have already submitted their responses to the Council, while others have expressed dissatisfaction with the French Council's decision to increase the land tax. The French Council does not intend to take any action for the time being. Once all the landlords' responses have been received, the Land Committee will meet again to discuss the reasons for and against this plan.

### Traditional Chinese Medicine Pediatrician Shen Zhongfang Abducted Yesterday: Shen Was Sitting and Treating Patients When Bandits Suddenly Burst In, Brandished Guns, and Forced Him Into a Car and Drove Away

At approximately 1:20 PM yesterday, a kidnapping occurred at 646 Jing'an Temple Road. The victim was Shen Zhongfang, a practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine. He was seized and taken outside, bundled into a waiting car, and driven away rapidly to the west. The details are as follows:

A Renowned and Respected Traditional Chinese Medicine Physician: Shen Zhongfang, a doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine specializing in internal medicine, is 63 years old and hails from Wujin. He has resided at 15 Mingyu Lane, 646 Jing'an Temple Road, for over ten years and enjoys a modest reputation in the medical community. He sees approximately 40 to 50 patients daily. He has three sons and two daughters, all of whom are young. His eldest son is not yet of age and is still in school. Shen's nephew, Xiaofang, usually assists his uncle in treating patients in the mornings at Shen's residence. Shen himself operates a clinic at 4 Jinfu Lane, at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Datong Road.

Well-Dressed Individuals Arrived One After Another:

Shen has been practicing medicine in Shanghai for over 30 years and has accumulated considerable wealth, making him a target for criminals. At approximately 8:00 AM yesterday, one person arrived to register as a patient, claiming to be named Gao from a certain address on Rue de l'Eglise. Then, at approximately 10:00 AM, two more people arrived, one wearing a gray silk long gown and the other a honey-colored serge long gown. A black rental car was parked at the entrance, with Concession registration number 12157 and Chinese registration number 2556. When the two men walked into the reception room, another man followed, wearing a business suit. All were well-dressed individuals, loitering in the courtyard. Suddenly, they drew handguns, acting as lookouts. The other two then burst into Shen's clinic in the right wing. At that time, there were two outpatients, Shen, wearing a white silk shirt and trousers, was sitting on a chair, quietly taking pulses. His student, Hu Silian, was writing a prescription.

Guns Were Brandished and Shen Was Forced into the Car:

Unexpectedly, the two kidnappers pulled out handguns and shouted loudly. The two patients in the room and Hu Silian remained silent, stunned. They then seized Shen and forced him out, driving him away in the waiting car number 12257. Another bandit, wearing a white shirt and trousers, drove the car at high speed, speeding away. Shen's servant, Zou Yaolin (29 years old, from Danyang), heard the commotion and ran out to chase them. He saw that the bandit car had a white license plate, with the numbers 12157, and its Chinese registration number was 2556. He inquired at number 909 in the alley, and the concierge said that when the car drove out of the alley, he seemed to see one person in the car with his head leaning on another person's shoulder, looking like a patient. The car drove straight west.

Car Numbers Suspected to Be Forged:

Afterward, Shen's residence reported the incident to the Xinza Police Station, who immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the scene. However, the bandit car had already vanished without a trace. They repeatedly returned to Shen's residence to investigate, hoping to track down the bandits and bring them to justice. It is reported that Shen owns a car, license number 3935. He usually only goes out on calls by introduction from acquaintances. Otherwise, he declines. Therefore, that car is not often used. Reporters learned that the bandit car was a company rental car, but when inquiries were made at various car rental companies, no carjacking had been reported yesterday. Whether the two numbers on the bandit car are forged is currently under investigation by the police.

### Canadian Trade Commissioner Gives Radio Speech: Canada Developing Resources, Intensifying War Effort

According to the Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, Mr. Stewart, the Canadian Trade Commissioner, spoke last night (the 30th) on the China Press radio station, stating that Canada is making extensive efforts with the British Empire to help Britain conduct the current war. Mr. Stewart outlined Canada's massive plan to develop its rich resources, which is currently being actively implemented. Industry is also doing its utmost to manufacture goods to support the war. The goal of every man and woman in Canada is to intensify the war effort, and they are currently fully implementing the Imperial Air Training Plan, training pilots and other aircrew. The industrial plan is being actively promoted, and excellent results have been achieved in the manufacture of aircraft, guns, and ammunition.

### No News from Xinan After Sailing to Fuqing

The Zhejiang-Fujian coastal voyage of foreign ships is being actively tested. The attempt to reach Biejing has been blocked and was unsuccessful. The Xinan ship, which sailed to Fuqing, was expected to arrive at its destination yesterday. However, when inquiring with the Fu Sheng Company, the company has not yet received a telegram. Therefore, the voyage is only to Songmen, causing the Zhejiang-Fujian shipping lines, which have been suspended for a long time, to now join this line to seek business development. However, it is quite inconvenient for travelers and cargo to transfer to the interior from Songmen. Therefore, passenger and freight volumes are not strong. The ships operating on this line are only slightly reducing their losses. The Haiyi ship set sail from Shanghai last night, carrying few passengers and cargo. However, there are rumors that Songmen has been bombed, but it is not known whether this is reliable.

### American Unit of Shanghai Volunteer Corps Takes Over Defense of Northern Central District: Assembled at 4 PM Yesterday and Took Over Defense at 7 PM; In the Future, They Will Rotate with British Members

After the British defense forces of the Shanghai International Settlement withdrew, the defense of the Central District, left only to the British units of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, was deemed too weak. Therefore, the authorities of the International Settlement decided to summon the American unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, Battalion B, to assist in the defense. According to reliable sources obtained by the Pingming News Agency, the headquarters of the Volunteer Corps summoned all members of Battalion B at 12:30 PM yesterday to assemble and await orders. By 4 PM yesterday, they had completed preparations and departed for the Hongkou Western District to complete the takeover procedures. Starting at 7 PM last night, the American Volunteer Corps officially assumed responsibility for the defense of the Hongkou Western District. The British Volunteer Corps, which had been responsible for defense in that area, withdrew at 7 PM last night and were given four days of rest.

British and American Units Take Turns:

Since the Shanghai Volunteer Corps temporarily filled the defense in District B, the Municipal Council has successively summoned British unit A, the British armored car unit, and the British light cavalry unit. However, starting yesterday, the American Volunteer Corps, Battalion B, has been summoned to assist in the defense. However, the Portuguese unit of Battalion B was not mobilized. Those summoned included the American unit, the Philippine unit, and the American machine gun unit, a total of over 200 men. Subsequently, every four or five days, the units of the American and British Volunteer Corps will take turns, jointly responsible for the defense of the Hongkou Western District.

Continue Processing Before Agreement:

The defense zone left by the withdrawal of the British army was originally decided by a majority vote at the August 15th meeting of the foreign defense forces, with District B to be taken over by the American army and District C to be taken over by the Japanese army. However, the Japanese side, disregarding the resolution of the defense forces meeting, strongly opposed it, having other intentions, and demanding to reserve the right to make alternative suggestions, causing the resolution to be delayed. The British and American volunteer corps will likely continue to assume the responsibility for the defense of District B for some time before the issue is resolved.

### United States Unanimously Supports Maintaining the Status Quo in the Far East: Prepared to Back with a Firm Policy; More Active Stance After the Election

According to The Times of London, Mr. Madi, a tycoon in the automobile industry of Shanghai, recently traveled in the United States and returned to Shanghai on Tuesday (the 27th) aboard the President Coolidge. He told reporters from this newspaper yesterday that the United States is currently engaged in a large-scale rearmament movement, and all domestic resources are concentrated on this great plan to manufacture aircraft, engines, warships, and all the tools used in modern warfare. When he left the United States on August 4, this arms expansion movement was actively underway, but had not yet reached its peak. It is expected that this plan will be completed in a few months.

Will Not Hesitate to Fight if Threatened:

Mr. Madi continued, "The general sentiment of the American people is that the United States should maintain its long-established principles of government and its economic and material security in the Western Hemisphere. If this security is threatened, the United States will not hesitate to go to war. Every American citizen, given the current volatile world political situation, feels that the rearmament movement underway in the country is of utmost importance for the survival of the future." Mr. Madi also said that although the United States does not currently have signs of wartime boom, such a situation is not far away. Factories for aircraft, steel, and munitions are working at high speed, and unemployment has greatly improved. At the same time, due to the wide circulation of money, other industries will soon experience a similar impact. Before Mr. Madi left the United States, he heard that the Ford Motor Company had received a contract to manufacture 40,000 aircraft engines for the government, while the Packard Motor Company would manufacture 10,000, with 6,000 custom-made for Britain and the remaining 4,000 made for the United States. Most Americans feel that after the presidential election in November, the government will adopt a more active stance in world politics, and the United States will have a stronger force in all its military preparations at that time.

The United States Pays Close Attention to the Far East Situation:

Regarding the Far East, Mr. Madi stated that the United States has always wanted to maintain the status quo in the Far East and is prepared to back it with a firm policy. As for the war between Britain and Germany, he said that it is not yet known what the opinions of the American people have been in the past few months, as the military situation in Europe has changed repeatedly, and there is a lack of accurate reports on the progress of the war. Since the capitulation of France, Americans who support the Allied powers have expressed extreme pessimism, but in recent weeks, the sense of discouragement has disappeared.

Monitoring Foreign Espionage:

Mr. Madi also stated that although the activities of the Fifth Column in the United States have become a real danger, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has good control over these activities. The FBI maintains close surveillance on the movements of all foreign nationals in the country. Regarding the upcoming presidential election, Mr. Madi said that in recent weeks, Wilkie seems to be gaining ground. A month ago, Roosevelt's advantage was ten to seven, then it fell to seven to five, but when Mr. Madi left the United States for Shanghai, it was already equal. Mr. Madi concluded by saying that 85 percent of American newspapers oppose Roosevelt's third term.

### Foreign Goods Stored in Zhejiang Stores: Deadline to Sell Out; From October 1st, The Trade Commission will Purchase Them

The Zhejiang Provincial Government, acting on orders from the Economic Warfare Department, has issued a directive to all stores to sell out all foreign goods by the end of September. From October 1st, it will no longer be permitted to continue selling them (except for pharmaceuticals among essential goods, and machinery and industrial supplies, which will be purchased by the authorities under overall planning). After receiving the order, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has now designated Jinhua, Ningbo, and Yongjia as the first three locations to implement it. All stores should sell out all stored foreign goods by the end of September. Otherwise, they will be purchased by the Trade Commission. If they are found again at that time, they will be confiscated.

### Strange Murder Case Occurs in Hongkou: Cui Guoming Shot Dead

On the previous day (the 29th), a shooting occurred in Hongkou, taking place on Dong Youheng Road. The Japanese side considers it serious and has been conducting a thorough investigation. At 9:30 PM on the afternoon of that day, seven men wearing short clothes, armed with weapons, rushed into the home of Cui Guoming (35 years old) at 29 Yuqing Lane, Dong Youheng Road, and shot Cui dead. Cui's occupation is currently unknown.

### Today is Journalists' Day: Reporters Solemnly Commemorate, Silent Mourning at Noon for Fallen Colleagues, Strengthen Conviction and Make Efforts in Respective Positions

Today, September 1st, is Chinese Journalists' Day. News circles throughout the country are engaged in enthusiastic celebrations. However, in Shanghai, due to the limiting environment, there will only be a solemn commemoration, and no ceremonies will be held. All newspapers and news agencies will continue to work as usual to promote the significant tasks during the period of resistance and national reconstruction. All reporters in the city, in addition to strengthening their conviction to promote the heavenly duty of reporters, will also observe three minutes of silence at noon to mourn the journalists who have died in Shanghai over the past three years in upholding the policy of resistance and national reconstruction.

### After Appreciation, Rice Prices Reach Peak Again: Price Limits Treated as Empty Words, Relaxation Unnecessary; Two Concession Authorities to Meet Again to Discuss

The Rice Exchange tea house market opened at 7:30 AM yesterday as usual. The market situation remained chaotic. Transactions in all foreign rice lots rose to the newly established price limits, and spot goods were scarce. People were nervous. Speculators are not only unwilling to sell off their goods at the newly established price limits but are also absorbing spot goods in the market. Generally, speculators believe that the price assessment committee can raise prices at any time, so the price limits will become empty words, disregarded. It was not necessary to relax the price limits for this food assessment. Some say that production costs have doubled and rice merchants are suffering losses. This is indeed a trick of speculators and should not be taken seriously. The goods bought and sold on the market yesterday were all shipped to Shanghai one month ago, and the abundance of rice stocks is undeniable. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that the committee will give it further consideration, immediately hold another meeting to lower the price limits, and strictly enforce them. This is what four million citizens hope for.

Miscellaneous Grain Market Resumes Afternoon Session

The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oilcake Exchange at 15 Avenue Edward VII had announced the suspension of the afternoon trading session for one month from July. Now that it is autumn and the period has expired, it was decided to resume afternoon trading from September 2nd, and the following announcement was made yesterday: "It is confirmed that the suspension of the afternoon market session of the Guild will end at the end of August. Starting September 2nd, the original state will be restored, and the market meeting time will be (still according to the new hours) from 9:30 AM to 12:00 noon and from 2:00 PM to 4:30 PM every day. This is hereby announced.

Concession Authorities Plan to Convene Meeting

According to Western authoritative sources, representatives of the British and French concessions are currently awaiting a joint meeting with Fu Xiao'an and Randu to seek a permanent solution to the city's rice problem. According to a senior official of the Municipal Council, although the rice situation has not reached alarming levels, he firmly believes that this problem must be solved through cooperation between the British and French concession authorities and the "Municipal Government." Some time ago, the British and French concession authorities and Fu Xiao'an held a meeting to improve the conditions for the transportation of rice from the interior into the concessions. After the completion of a preliminary investigation, the meeting was postponed. At that time, it was found that illegal habits in the rice market, such as speculative profiteering and hoarding, were caused by the lack of inflow from the interior, causing panic. Although it was unanimously agreed to convene a second meeting later, no action has been taken to date.

Rice Stocks Sufficient for Four Months

At the same time, according to the senior official, the Municipal Council's Rice Supply Committee does not intend to convene a special meeting. Although the blockade of Vietnamese ports has cut off Shanghai's connection to the world's largest rice-producing region, the committee still considers the rice reserves here to be quite satisfactory. The official pointed out that, according to reliable reports, the city's rice stocks are sufficient for consumption for the next four months, even if all imports are cut off.

### Public Bus Passenger Assaults Ticket Inspector

The English "North China Daily News" reports that at 4:30 PM on the 30th, a No. 2 public bus, nearing the terminal at the Sichuan Road bridge, had a group of passengers inside who refused to pay for tickets. They engaged in a verbal dispute with the Chinese ticket inspector, which escalated into physical assault. The ticket inspector sustained serious injuries to his face and hands. Fortunately, Chinese and Indian police arrived in time to rescue him. Five passengers involved in the assault were arrested and may be charged with assault. It is believed that several other passengers also participated in the attack on the ticket seller but managed to escape. A reporter inquired about the case to an employee of the China General Omnibus Company on the morning of the 31st. The response was that the police were still investigating. Apart from the ticket inspector requesting the passengers to pay their fares, there seemed to be no other reason for the incident. The ticket inspector's injuries, after medical treatment, are in a stable condition.

### Heroin Dealer Speaks English

Wei Lifeng from Jilin, recently assisted a Japanese person in opening a Huishengtang heroin den at No. 160, Lane 1394, Edward Road. After being discovered by the Narcotics Suppression Department, two Korean individuals were arrested and sent to the Japanese consulate for investigation. Unexpectedly, after being released by the Japanese consulate, the two Koreans remained unrepentant and instructed Wei Lifeng to expand their promotion, printing thousands of advertising leaflets to distribute in various neighborhoods to drug addicts. He was arrested by the Chengdu Road Police the night before and 370 packages of varying sizes of heroin were found. He was taken back to the police station for investigation. The defendant, Wei Lifeng, spoke fluent English, claiming to be Portuguese. However, the Portuguese consulate did not recognize Wei as a Portuguese national. Because the defendant refused to admit his real name and origin, the police, yesterday morning, based on the name he provided (Henry Herbert), charged him with drug trafficking in the First Special Court. After a trial in the Second Criminal Court by the presiding judge, Henry Herbert was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for drug trafficking, and the drugs were confiscated.

### Zhang Xiaolin Murder Case: Official Prosecution by Police; Bodyguards Summoned to Testify; Investigation to be Extended

Shanghai celebrity Zhang Xiaolin was shot and killed by his bodyguard, Lin Huaibu, at 2 PM on the 14th of last month after dismissing him. Simultaneously, Zhang's disciple, Wu Jianchen, was also shot dead by Lin. Afterwards, Lin abandoned his gun and fled, but was apprehended by foreign police and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. After an initial interrogation by Judge Liao, the case was adjourned as the police had not yet filed charges. This was previously reported. Yesterday morning was the date for the continued hearing, and the public gallery was full. French police officers were stationed around the court. The following is a detailed account from the Shanghai Guangshe reporter.

Police Prosecution

First, the police lawyer, Yao Zhao, stated the prosecution's intent, roughly saying that the defendant was Zhang Xiaolin's bodyguard. On the 14th of this month, at 2 PM, the defendant felt unwell and wanted to ask Zhang for leave. He asked Zhang's chauffeur, Wang Wenliang, to convey the message, but Wang refused. The two then argued in the courtyard downstairs. Zhang and his disciple, Wu Jianchen, were talking upstairs and heard the argument. Zhang looked out the window and asked what was happening. Because the defendant's reply was careless, Zhang ordered him to put down his gun and dismissed him. The defendant then reached for his gun and shot Zhang in the face, who fell immediately. The defendant then went upstairs and shot Wu Jianchen twice, who also fell to the ground. Seeing Zhang still moving, he shot him again, killing him on the spot. Wu Jianchen was sent to the hospital, but died from his injuries. The police are now prosecuting the defendant for murder under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law.

Detective's Report

Following, the investigating detective, Zhang Dongcheng, reported that since the case occurred, a thorough investigation was conducted. Ten witnesses have been summoned: Wang Wenliang, Zhao Ajin, Zhang Jinlong, Liu Deyuan, Hu Yongkui, Zhang Yongdian, Shen Fuyuan, Bai Zhenping, Yang Ziliang, and Zhang Jinkui, all of whom are Zhang's bodyguards or servants. Except for Wang Wenliang and Zhao Ajin, who were questioned during the previous hearing, the court is requested to question the remaining witnesses in detail. If there is no suspicion of a crime, the police will not prosecute. Otherwise, the court is requested to handle the matter according to law. Then, the criminal Lin Huaibu's statement was heard.

Criminal's Confession

I was introduced to Zhang's house by Wang Wenliang in April of last year to work as a bodyguard at home, not to go out. My father was originally the commander of the 39th Regiment of the Army. After his death, the funeral was helped by various celebrities in Shanghai. Later, I joined the French police as Chinese Constable No. 147, but the salary of only 20 yuan per month was not enough to live on, so I resigned. I worked as a Chinese constable in both the British and French concessions for about 49 years. I treated Wang Wenliang with false humility and addressed him as my godfather, with the intention of having Wang recommend me to the boss. Unexpectedly, Wang not only refused to recommend me but also often made things difficult for me. Although Wang Wenliang was not directly responsible for killing Zhang Xiaolin, he should also bear the responsibility for the murder. If I had not been angered by Wang's arrogance, I would never have committed such a murder. However, when Zhang Xiaolin stopped my business, I was temporarily confused and did not know how many shots I fired at Zhang. Afterwards, I pointed the gun at my own temple, intending to commit suicide, but failed because the bullets were used up. The shooting of Wu Jianchen was also unintentional. I did not know Wu at all. At that time, Wu grabbed me and refused to let go, so I killed him as well.

Witness Testimonies

Finally, Zhang's chauffeur, Wang Wenliang, stated that the defendant came to me in 1935 with a photo of his deceased father, wanting me to introduce him to Boss Zhang. I was incessantly bothered by him, so I introduced him to Boss Zhang, who hired him. Afterwards, the defendant addressed me as his godfather, and I also helped him divide the family property with his stepmother and provided funds for his uncle to open a military band store, from which he greatly profited. I then helped the defendant get married and start a family. Unexpectedly, on the day of the incident, the defendant did not ask for leave from his supervisor but instead wanted me to convey the message, which led to an argument. Later, Zhang Xiaolin heard about it and looked out the window to ask about it. The defendant then became enraged and shot Zhang. I knew the defendant still wanted to hit me, so I slipped away. Afterwards, I heard two more gunshots upstairs. The maid Zhao Ajin said, "I serve the old master. On that day, I saw the boss being shot and falling to the ground, so I went to the back to report to the mistress." The bodyguard Zhang Jinlong stated, (55 years old, from Hangzhou, responsible for escorting the young master to and from school), that the defendant usually behaved well. On that day, I was dozing off in the hall. I knew that the defendant and Wang were arguing, but I only heard gunshots. Liu Deyuan stated, (45 years old, from Hebei), that I caught the murderer. I have been a bodyguard in the Zhang family for 14 years. I was not in the living room when the boss was shot, so I did not know. Later, I heard gunshots and rushed out the door to catch the defendant. Hu Yongkui stated, (36 years old, from Luhe), that he has been a bodyguard for more than three years. He was not present during the shooting and did not know the details. Zhang Yongdian stated (38 years old, from Anhui) that he has been a bodyguard for 14 years. I usually served the old master by writing, and on that day I only heard gunshots, but I did not know the rest. Shen Fuyuan stated, (51 years old, from Hebei), that he was specifically in charge of attending to cars entering and exiting the gate, so he only heard gunshots inside. Bai Zhenping (35 years old, from Hebei) and Zhang Jinkui (48 years old, from Hebei) both stated that their positions were the same as Shen Fuyuan's, and their testimonies were also the same. Yang Ziliang stated, (49 years old, from Anhui), that he has been a bodyguard for eight years. I stopped the defendant and Wang from arguing the first time. Later, I did not know about the argument. When I heard gunshots, I rushed out the door and caught the defendant. The court reviewed the circumstances and ordered that the case be further investigated and adjourned. The defendant was returned to custody, and the witnesses were taken back by the police.

### Wang Duqing Passed Away Yesterday; Funeral Today

The poet Wang Duqing, a key member of the Creation Society, recently contracted typhoid fever and was hospitalized in the Tongren Hospital branch on Bailinan Road. Friends and relatives were concerned. Unexpectedly, Mr. Wang's condition worsened and he finally passed away yesterday. The funeral will be held today at the Anle Funeral Parlor on Gordon Road.

### Lu Xiaojia Loses Money Speculating; Accuses Bank Comprador of Fraud; Defendant Found Not Guilty

Lu Junjia, son of former Zhejiang Governor Lu Yongxiang, recently filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court against Liu Yinsheng, a comprador at the Huayi Bank on Jiangxi Road (son of banking tycoon Liu Hui), accusing him of fraud. The court accepted the case, and Judge Fang presided over the trial yesterday. The defendant, Liu Yinsheng, hired lawyers Shan Yuhua and Ling Changyan to defend him. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the intention of the private prosecution, saying that the plaintiff, Lu Xiaojia, entrusted the defendant, Liu Yinsheng, to buy and sell pounds with Huaibi in July of last year. The exchange rate reported by the defendant was different from the actual exchange rate, causing the plaintiff to lose more than 18,000 Hong Kong dollars. The defendant's falsely reported exchange rate constituted fraud and requested the court to punish him according to law. Then, lawyer Ling Changyan stated that the defendant, Liu Yinsheng, was entrusted by the plaintiff to buy and sell pounds with Hong Kong dollars. The transfer slips were all signed and acknowledged by the plaintiff. The plaintiff bought futures, not spot goods. Even if the plaintiff lost money, it cannot be blamed on the defendant. The court questioned both parties for a long time and announced the end of the debate, declaring Liu Yinsheng not guilty.

### British Concession Curfew Passes to be Changed at the End of the Month

Since the withdrawal of British troops from the Public Concession, security has been tightened. The western district, in particular, is under strict surveillance. Suspicious pedestrians and vehicles are often searched. Curfew enforcement is also more strict. The curfew passes issued by the Public Concession authorities will expire at the end of September. New passes will be required starting October 1st, costing two yuan each. Currently, it is still possible to travel by car at night, but searches may be conducted if necessary.

### Weather Report

The Zikawei Observatory reported the following at 4:30 PM yesterday: Shandong is cloudy all around, with winds from no particular direction, with localized fog or showers. It is overcast here, with strong easterly winds and showers. The weather is very bad along the coast south of the Yangtze River, with cyclones. The hurricane off the coast of Fujian is moving northwest or north-northwest.

Also, in the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was 87.3 degrees and the lowest was 75.9 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 86.4 degrees and the lowest was 68.5 degrees.

The picture on the right is a view of London in the fog.

### Overview of London

London, the world's largest metropolis, is situated on the banks of the River Thames, about sixty miles from the sea. It encompasses "London County," with an area of 116 square miles, and "Greater London," with an area of 693 square miles, and a population of eight million. Before the 19th century, London was merely a city district, with an area of no more than a square mile. Subsequently, the surrounding villages and towns were connected to form "Greater London," which became not only the capital of England but also the world's financial and commercial center. It is divided into several parts: (1) The City, (2) The East End, (3) The West End. The entire area has 1,500 churches of all sizes, over one hundred parks and squares, about two hundred hospitals of all sizes, and countless famous buildings. All national railway lines terminate in London. There are over 700 miles of railway lines within London, including 171 miles of underground railway, with 600 million passengers annually. There are also 5,600 public buses, with 1.9 billion passengers annually, and 356 miles of tram lines, with 900 million passengers annually. The dock area covers 650 hectares, with 28 miles of quays. Annual foreign trade amounts to about 1 billion pounds, accounting for three-quarters of the country's trade. Croydon Airport, located in the western suburbs, was developed during the last World War and was transformed into the world's best airport in 1928.

### Comparison of Military Expenditures of Britain, Germany, and Japan

— Day and Month

Japan's fourth budget since the war with China totals ¥10,360,000,000,000, which, calculated at the official exchange rate, is approximately $2,830,000,000. The amount is unprecedented in Japanese history. Of this budget, military expenditures account for about 65%, totaling $1,580,000,000, of which $1,000,000,000 is for the China Incident. Japan's total revenue is ¥25,000,000,000, approximately $6,000,000,000, so the above budget accounts for two-fifths of the total revenue. Only 40% of the budget is funded by taxes, with the remainder requiring the issuance of public bonds. It is not surprising that Japan's national debt has doubled since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Furthermore, only two-thirds of the recently issued Japanese public bonds have been subscribed, and the amount of Japanese currency in circulation has increased by two and a half times since the summer of 1937. Therefore, although the tax burden on the Japanese people is extremely heavy, the trend of inflation is evident.

The military expenditure of Japan in the war against China, including the specified fourth budget, totals $4,343,000,000, averaging about $1,000,000,000 per year, which can be compared with the expenditure of the current European war.

The London "Economist" magazine published on March 16 this year, contains comparative figures of national wealth and military expenditure of Britain and Germany as follows (in millions of pounds per month):

The above figures are compared with the Japanese budget as follows (in millions of US dollars per year):

### The Rise and Fall of American Film and Music

— EL

Everyone knows that the United States is the birthplace of film in the world. Mentioning "Hollywood" is almost universally known. Although the film industry in the United States is not as important as national defense industries, its influence is vast and deeply rooted in the people. In the past decade, it has looked down upon everything. However, things in the world always decline after reaching their peak. How can the American film industry, which has reached its zenith, escape this common rule? Therefore, in order to attract customers, second-rate and below theaters do not hesitate to compete fiercely with each other by using "big sales" and "big giveaways". Thus, various promotional methods such as "double features" and "extra gifts, even free meals" emerge one after another. Samuel Goldwyn, the head of MGM, a major film company, recently complained about this issue, believing that if this continues, the future of the American film industry is very pessimistic. So, he wrote an article "Hollywood is Sick" and loudly called for attention to this serious problem so that the film industry, which has already opened the "door of decline," will not really collapse. This is the current state of American cinema. Secondly, the trend of American music is inversely proportional to that of film. It is growing quietly and showing great improvement. Dr. Hanson, the director of the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester in New York, recently praised at the National Education Conference that the United States has become "the most developed country in the world for music."

Currently, there are approximately 17,500 movie theaters in the United States. Approximately 60% to 65% of them show two features at each showing, but these are all second-rate or below theaters. First-run theaters only show one feature at each showing, accounting for approximately 35% to 40% of the total. In terms of moviegoers in the United States, at least half of them go to these first-run theaters. This half of the movie audience accounts for three-quarters of the total box office revenue. In this case, first-run customers are the "bread and butter" of film companies. Therefore, Paramount's vice president, Freeman, once said that it is a miscalculation for film companies to hand over their productions to second-rate and below theaters for screenings. Most of the profits of the film come from first-run theaters. A good film always runs for several terms. Later, when the film is sent to second-run or third-run theaters, two features are shown at each showing, and the films are changed every day. He really felt sentimental about it.

In recent years, statistics show that the box office revenue of films has been declining. In 1930, American cinemas sold an average of 80 million tickets per week. In 1940, no matter how much progress has been made in film production technology, the weekly ticket sales are still less than 65 million. From this point of view, isn't the film industry already "seriously ill"?

According to Dr. Gallup, a survey was conducted by voting to test the public's attitude towards one feature versus two features at each showing. Although the final results have not yet been announced, he estimates with reliable prediction that approximately three out of four people do not approve of two features at each showing, compared to one who approves. Among them, the middle and upper classes, whose weekly income is around $25, are particularly opposed to the two-feature system. These people are the patrons of 80-cent, 50-cent, and 40-cent movie theaters. 40-cent patrons disapprove of the two-feature system the most, but the money they contribute to the film industry is the most considerable. In terms of the number of tickets, of course, the number of tickets sold by second-rate and below theaters is larger than that of first-rate theaters, but the profits obtained by the film industry from the sale of "40-cent tickets" are actually greater than those from two 15-cent tickets, so the opinions of 40-cent patrons cannot be ignored.

Under the prevalence of the two-feature system, Hollywood production companies have no choice but to resort to shoddy workmanship in order to meet the needs of all parties. Currently, the annual production of features is 600. Even if all the best playwrights in the world are invited to Hollywood, I am afraid they will not be able to create 600 good scripts. And even in these 600 films, it is unlikely that more than 50 can be considered top choices, and the other 150 are just passable. This pessimistic phenomenon is partly due to the lack of good playwrights, but the production companies' pursuit of rapid delivery and the crude and slapdash production of scripts are also partly to blame.

In the past, film production was very meticulous and detailed in every aspect. After the production was completed, it had to go through a preview to see how the audience reacted. If the audience laughed at a serious scene, or if no one laughed at an interesting scene, then the film would have to be taken back to the studio to investigate the cause and make repairs. MGM once spent four months modifying and reshooting a film after it was completed before releasing it. This is the difference between an average film and a good film, but now production companies only seek to increase output, so where is this kind of meticulousness?

Secondly, in order to fully develop the plot, an average feature film requires a running time of one hour and twenty minutes, or even two hours. However, movie theaters often openly ask production companies to make the film as short as possible. If the running time is too long, then there is no way to continue showing another feature film and other short films. The audience will inevitably demand it in the second showing. Under this requirement, a film is often cut and cut again. How can the result be good? In fact, as long as the film is good, the audience will never complain about the length of time. Just look at "Gone with the Wind," which made the audience sit for a full four hours!

There is no shortage of movie stars, but with 600 films, there are only about 50 outstanding people. Sometimes, a good role does not match the personality of the character in the play, and the result is very bad. In the past, the average acting life of a first-class star was ten to fifteen years. I only need to mention Fairbanks and Mary Pickford. The lifespan of current stars is only about five years; often the starlight appears and disappears quickly.

Any major film production company divides the country into several distribution regions. In each region, several cities are designated as "major cities." There is one or several first-run theaters in these cities. All new films produced by the company are released in these first-run theaters. Let us now call the theaters that specialize in "first-run" films Class A theaters, and assume that the ticket price is 50 cents. After the new film has been screened in Class A theaters, there is a two-week break before it is sent to Class B theaters for screening, with a ticket price of 35 or 40 cents. Similarly, after Class B theaters have finished screening, after a one-week break, it is sent to Class C theaters for screening, with a ticket price of 25 cents. This break period is called the "cleaning period" and is specially designed to protect the interests of the exhibitors. Because the fresher the film, the higher the ticket price.

However, the hierarchy of movie theaters is not limited to three types: A, B, and C. It gets worse and worse, followed by D, E, and even F. These small movie theaters have to wait a year or a year and a half after a film is released before it is their turn to screen it. At this time, the ticket price and the cleaning period have been reduced to the lowest possible level. In the situation where the ticket price has already been reduced to the limit in the E-grade theater, what attractive methods can the boss of the F-grade theater use to attract audiences? And when the film that E-grade theater is screening tonight is shown in the F-grade theater tomorrow, the ticket price will be reduced by 10 cents: Then, if E-grade theater sells it for 10 cents more, won't people say that it has "no good reason"? Therefore, showing two features at a time has become the same way out for these two theaters. (To be continued)

### Dance (2)

When the Han Dynasty communicated with the Xiongnu, the Hu music spread in China. Instruments such as the zheng, the horn, and the pipa, with their busy, urgent, sorrowful, and unrestrained sounds, changed the proper, upright, peaceful listening. Gradually, with gold drums and silk bamboo, miscellaneous dramas were performed, and dance eventually changed into introductions, and then into acrobatics. However, in the successive ceremonies of the suburban sacrifice to heaven, ancestral temples, and imperial school, ancient musical instruments, lyrics, and dance steps were still used, but the number of instruments and the appearance of the sounds were not entirely the same over time. Apart from these matters, however, the common people could not see it. In the literary temples of various provinces, except for the few prefectures and counties that have recently renovated the rites and music, the rest all have music stands empty and dance steps unsynchronized. In recent years, some ceremonies have been performed, and those who saw them were in an uproar, as if they were about to laugh. This shows how deeply ingrained the customs are, and how difficult it is to restore the ancient ways. Dance includes civil virtue dances with feathers and flutes, and military prowess dances with shields and axes. Now the civil dance has been transformed into introductions in dramas, and the military dance has been transformed into acrobatics and fighting stunts, and the people are happy to watch them. The changes of things have reached this point, which is truly regrettable! I have occasionally heard Western music. For each word sung, a musical instrument sounds. Their singing and dancing are accompanied by the instruments, which respond with notes and rhythms, much like the dances of civil virtue. As for the musical instruments being different from those in China, the instruments are chosen according to preference and do not necessarily have to be made the same as in China. In general, Western musical instruments have fewer silk and bamboo sounds and more percussive sounds. Although it is different from China, its intention is similar to ancient music and dance.

### The Bravery of Jesus Christ (1)

In the past, when Jesus was nailed to the cross, many onlookers mocked and ridiculed him, saying, "He saved others, but he cannot save himself." In reality, it was not that Jesus could not save himself, but because he wanted to save others that he did not save himself, willingly enduring the pain of the cross. This was an ultimate expression of Jesus's love for the world. However, from another perspective, it also demonstrates Jesus's bravery. Fear and love are both the original driving forces behind all cultures in human society. People sew clothes because they fear the cold; they build houses because they fear wind and rain; they build ships because they fear drowning; they refrain from doing evil because they fear punishment. Although fear provides considerable assistance to the progress of human culture, it also has its drawbacks, as it easily generates many superstitions that hinder cultural development. Jesus not only had the courage to sacrifice himself on the cross and calmly face death, but he was also courageous in everything he did for others throughout his life. The words "Do not be afraid" were his motto to encourage people. Now, based on the records of Jesus's words and deeds, we present several aspects of Jesus's bravery:

(1) Being Faithful to God and the Truth: "Some of the people of Jerusalem said, 'Isn't this the man they are trying to kill? Look! He is speaking publicly.'" (John 7:26). Even when some people wanted to kill him and he was surrounded by danger, he still disregarded everything and bore witness to God and the truth, urging people to obey the truth, to have a genuine spirit of returning to God, to value practicality, and not to emphasize empty formalities. Even his enemies said that he "teaches the way of God in accordance with the truth. He isn't swayed by others." (Matthew 22:16).

(2) Not Afraid to Expose the Hypocrisy of People at the Time: Ordinary people always like to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of others behind their backs, saying who is virtuous and who is not. But when they meet face-to-face, they try their best to flatter and please them in every way. Jesus was not like this. His attitude towards people was consistent both inwardly and outwardly, with his heart and mouth in agreement. He was not polite to the authorities in politics and religion at the time, pointing out their wrongs and saying that they were whitewashed tombs, beautiful on the outside but full of dead people's bones on the inside.

### Observing Things

— Mu Sheng

Children, isn't the purpose of attending classes and studying at school to seek knowledge? However, the knowledge gained at school is limited. The main thing is to rely on yourselves to find knowledge outside of class.

There are many things that you see every day, but can you understand their structure, organization, origin, cause, and the reasons why they are the way they are? For example, we see cars every day, but can you understand how they are constructed? Who invented them? Why can they move? In the summer, everyone has to get vaccinated, but can you understand what vaccination is? How many types of vaccination are there? Why do we need to get vaccinated? If you cannot answer these questions, you should observe them carefully, and then study them meticulously, and you must find the correct answers. We must observe the things we see around us, no matter how small the problem, such as why dogs stick their tongues out in the summer, and we must ask "why" and find the reason. If you still don't know after observing and researching, you can ask others until you understand.

Children! If you can do what I say, then I can guarantee that the knowledge you gain will definitely be more than the knowledge you gain from books in a semester.

### Employment is Seeking Knowledge

— Yang Chunlv

Rongguang! Dearest children! Today, your father came to school and talked about how you are unhappy all day long because your father cannot afford to send you to school and plans to send you to be an apprentice. Oh! What should I say to comfort you!

Rongguang! Being able to study is indeed fortunate; but being employed does not cut off the opportunity to seek knowledge. "Employment is seeking knowledge!" You must know that all knowledge is produced in society, and it is definitely not something that can be fully encompassed by the narrow classrooms in schools. The whole of society is a large school, and all kinds of life are living subjects that you can explore as much as you want and experience to your heart's content.

Many great people throughout history, both in China and abroad, have struggled their way out of apprenticeships! You have heard of them: Stephenson, who created the railway in England, Edison, who invented the light bulb in the United States, Wang Yunwu, who invented the Four-Corner Method for Searching Characters in our country, and Yang Jichuan, who created the Huasheng electric fan... They were all apprentices when they were young. Being an apprentice will never limit a person's development. As long as you can work hard and make progress, success will beckon you.

Rongguang! You don't have to be so unhappy. From today onwards, you should cheer up and plan how to work hard in the infinitely large society! I also hope that every child who drops out of school to work will embark on the path to success in this way!

### Paratroopers

— Jin Jian

The war in Europe has been going on for almost a year, and in recent weeks, the Anglo-German air war has been very fierce. All kinds of novel weapons are being tested for their power. To what extent have they reached? Flame-throwing planes, silent bombs... are all the crystallization of scientists' efforts, but they are being used by the god of war to slaughter people. This tragic scene of people killing people is being staged all over the earth.

One day, probably in the middle of last month, Ah Hui inadvertently saw this news in the newspaper: "The guard in a town in central England discovered a gray object in the air and immediately warned that German paratroopers had landed in central England, so they searched extensively, but did not find any trace of paratroopers... paratroopers." Paratroopers were another new name, and of course Ah Hui was baffled in his simple mind. So it sparked a conversation between him and Ah Ming.

"Brother, what exactly are paratroopers?"

"Paratroopers are indeed a very new name. This tactic was not used in the First World War in Europe. The first to invent this novel tactic was indeed Soviet Russia. Every time they held a Red Army parade or an air show, there were often paratrooper landing performances. A large plane is full of fully armed soldiers, flying down from the high sky, and umbrellas are flying in the air. Just imagine how wonderful this picture is, but this is just a performance. This time Germany also wants to use this tactic, hoping to land in England. According to reports, German parachutes were found in England, but no paratroopers were found, but Germany does have the possibility of using paratroopers. If the warring countries use paratrooper attacks, the battlefield will be expanded many times over, and there will be no distinction between front and rear, and it will be even more difficult for the defending side. For example, the French Maginot Line, the equipment is so perfect, the construction is so solid, truly a copper wall and iron wall, and the enemy cannot cross the line. If the other side uses paratroopers to attack the rear of the defense line, then no matter how solid the defense line is, it will lose its effectiveness. It is said that paratrooper training is much more difficult than ordinary soldiers, because paratroopers must have the knowledge of both the army and the air force, and they must also have the courage to take risks and not be afraid of death. Think about it, the soldiers of one country enter the interior of the enemy country with weapons, and they must also be familiar with all the terrain of the enemy country. This is a very difficult thing, so paratroopers are just a kind of spy. If they really attack the rear, it is impossible. However, paratroopers are ultimately a special product of the Second World War in Europe. There is an old saying in our country, 'Flying generals descend from the sky,' which has only been proven to be true in modern times.

### Only Children Laughed When They Heard It

— Xian Fang

I don't know how many years ago, in I don't know which mountain, a lion fell asleep. A wolf quietly came over and gently tied it up with a rope. It was sleeping soundly and didn't notice anything. Later, because it was tied too tightly, it woke up and resisted. Although it suffered a lot because it was tied up, it was exhausted and almost breathless.

At that time, not far away, a tiger and a leopard suddenly fought fiercely. The leopard beckoned to the wolf, asking it to help kill the tiger. The wolf couldn't bear to part with the tiger's fat meat, but it couldn't get away from the lion's plight; so it said to the tiger, "If you don't want me to help the leopard, help me tie up the lion." The tiger nodded and tied the lion tightly.

The wolf was satisfied, not afraid of the lion's revenge, and happily joined the leopard in attacking the tiger, hoping to kill the tiger and share a piece of fat meat.

The lion, tied tightly, was angry. It used all its strength, activated every vein and every cell, struggling, trying to struggle, breaking free from its bonds, and regaining its freedom. With a roar, it swallowed the wolf and killed the tiger... The children clapped their hands and laughed when they heard this.

### A Letter Discussing Writing (Part 2)

— He Ren

(3) Don't let go of opportunities to practice. There are many opportunities to write in your daily life, don't let them go easily. For example, every night, Mom has to keep the petty cash account, you should snatch it to write. If there is a vacant house for rent at home, don't let Dad write the rental notice. As for at school, there are even more opportunities to write. Copying compositions, taking notes, practicing math problems, all are good opportunities to practice, don't scribble carelessly.

(4) Practice writing misspelled words and poorly written words more often. Pay attention to the words that you often misspell or that don't look good, take them out, and record them in a small notebook. Then use waste materials, such as old textbooks, old newspapers, etc., to find the words you recorded, cut out the well-written ones, paste them in another notebook, and often copy them.

(5) Practice writing small and medium-sized characters more often. The most common application of writing in society is accounting and writing letters. Accounting ledgers for accounting and letter paper for writing letters each have straight line grids. Although the width of the grids is not uniform, it is always around three or four points, which can be used as the standard for small characters. Similarly, medium-sized characters can use the characters on ordinary envelopes and the covers of account books as a standard, from seven or eight points to one inch square. Since we should pay attention to practicality when we first start writing, we should naturally practice small and medium-sized characters more often.

(6) Pencil and fountain pen writing should also be practiced. Nowadays, the application of pencil and fountain pen writing in society is becoming more and more common every day. For example, most of the invoices issued in stores are written in pencil, and most of the new-style accounts are kept in fountain pen. Once you enter middle school, you will mostly use pencil and fountain pen for taking study notes and doing homework exercises. Since the application of pencils and fountain pens is so widespread, you should naturally spend some time practicing pencil and fountain pen writing.

(7) It is best to practice with friends and often have writing competitions. You can invite nearby children to form a writing competition club. Be sure to write a piece of writing every day, and compete once a week to see whose writing is better and who is progressing faster. This can arouse the spirit of competition, increase interest, and progress will naturally be faster. "A thousand days makes a good calligrapher" This does not mean that if you practice writing for only a thousand days, you will definitely write well, but it just means that as long as you have perseverance and continue to practice every day, your writing will never be bad. Work hard! Dear brothers and sisters. Zhige. 29, 8, 23,

### Mrs. Roosevelt Stars in Charity Film

— Hua Zhi

A "Guanyin" in Feng Shui

The family of US President Roosevelt is full of artistic atmosphere, and the children are all talented. Since Roosevelt's eldest son, James, gave up his insurance business a few years ago and engaged in the film business, the whole family's interest in silver screen art has greatly increased.

The President's wife, Eleanor, is usually a model for women, excelling in writing and speaking, generous and righteous, and highly respected. She regards the film business as a good educational tool and actively promotes it. Although she has appeared on the silver screen in some newsreels, she has not had the opportunity to formally star in a film.

Until recently, Mrs. Roosevelt, in order to promote charitable causes, at the request of her eldest son, actually agreed to star in a charity film for Fox Company, which is undoubtedly an amazing piece of news. With the status of the First Lady of a country, personally dedicating herself to the silver screen, the former Queen of Albania had this idea after fleeing to the United States, but it was not realized due to incompatible conditions, and Mrs. Roosevelt took the lead.

The film starring Mrs. Roosevelt is called "The Joy of Doing Good," and its subject matter takes the social life of upper-class American women as the warp and philanthropy as the weft. It has the style of the Chinese domestic film "Guanyin." This film is planned to be performed publicly in places raising charitable funds to increase fundraising efficiency.

Of course, Mrs. Roosevelt's starring role is completely voluntary and will not receive any remuneration. Moreover, her usual income from various writings and broadcasts is already very high. Also, when child star Shirley Temple visited Washington two years ago, she paid homage to the President and Mrs. Roosevelt at the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt liked her very much and hoped that she would make more films that could transform human nature in the future. Recently, there has been talk of Shirley retiring, and some people have therefore spread the rumor that she wants to make a charity film as her swan song.

### Carlton's Postponed Opening

— Ling Bai

Wang Xichun and Zhou Xinfang Fall Ill One After Another

Carlton announced a summer break a month and a half ago because it was not cost-effective to open air conditioning, but the lineup of the Yifeng Society was being adjusted invisibly. For example, Jin Suwen, Yu Zongying, Liu Wenkui, Zhang Huicong, etc., have all joined the Gongwutai and Tianchan Stage respectively. At the same time, Zhou Xinfang also used a calm mind to invite Jiang Yunxia, Wang Jingyan, Gai Hequn, Wang Yingwu, etc. Among them, Wang Xichun's re-joining the collaboration should be the most gratifying to the audience.

Originally, Carlton was scheduled to open on the 27th of last month. However, because Wang Xichun was busy with film work, she fell ill and had to let her rest for a few days, so the opening was postponed to the 2nd of this month, and it has been planned to perform old dramas for a month first, and then arrange "Six Chapters of Wen Suchen." Unexpectedly, just when everything was being actively planned, Zhou Xinfang also fell ill. Reviewing the reason for his illness this time, it turned out that he had a part in the three-day charity performance of the Lingjie United Association Baochan Association. He did not feel tired in the first two days. On the third day, he performed the entire "Lu Junyi and Shi Wengong" in the day show for a full six hours. In the evening, he performed the heavy "Battle of Changsha." At that time, he was already incapable of doing so on stage, but he was very competitive and persisted, resulting in excessive fatigue and falling ill.

Now, his illness has not lessened, and his temperature is always between 101 and 102 degrees every day, so he may not be able to fully recover in a short period of time. Of course, the opening date of Carlton will also have to be postponed.

Hawthorne Detective Case

### The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 6 Dangerous Experiences

Although the young man lowered his head again, he still didn't answer. However, I could still see a blush on his pale face. He was biting his lip.

Ni Jinshou suddenly answered instead. "I believe his studies may just be a front, just busy playing with dancers, fighting for love, and even committing murder. His studies may not be on his mind at all."

Hawthorne didn't answer, but smiled coldly, glanced at the young man with a scrutinizing gaze, and then looked down at his leather shoes. He sat down on a sofa and casually put his bowler hat on the tea table next to him.

Ni Jinshou also returned to his original seat and tapped his fingers on the edge of the desk. "I have explained everything we have found out about his motives and actions. But he is stiff and unwilling to speak."

Hawthorne put his glasses and false beard in his pocket. He suddenly saw the nickel-plated pistol on the desk, so he stood up, took the gun to look at it, put it back down, and returned to his original seat. He slowly replied, "Unwilling to speak? Then you don't need to be anxious. He will eventually speak."

Ni Jinshou seemed a little disappointed. He seemed to hope that Hawthorne would do the work for him, but he didn't expect Hawthorne to be so understated. Hawthorne took a cigarette case out of his pocket.

He said, "Brother Jinshou, I think the best way is to first give Mr. Yu a chance to reflect. When he feels like he wants to speak, we will talk to him again."

Ni Jinshou didn't answer, but pressed the electric bell button next to the desk. A servant came in response. Ni Jinshou pointed to Yu Gantang with his hand. "Take him out and lock him up!"

The young man wanted to resist, but after a moment's consideration, he suddenly stood up and followed the uniformed servant out. The door of the office closed again as before. (93)
