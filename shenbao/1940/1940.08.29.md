### Regarding the Latest Situation in Vietnam: Foreign Minister Wang Issues a Statement, Firmly Expressing Determination to Defend Ourselves. If Japanese Armed Forces Land in Vietnam, China Will Immediately Dispatch Troops Across the Border. Ambassador to Japan Will Attend Meeting in Chongqing

Chongqing: Recent rumors suggest that Japan will send a large number of troops to land in Vietnam and take military action. Foreign Minister Wang issued a statement today, firmly expressing China's determination to defend itself. The statement roughly stated that while China is resisting aggression, it originally had no intention of sending troops into foreign countries unless Japanese troops used foreign territory to attack China. Therefore, the Chinese troops stationed near the Vietnamese border would remain in Chinese territory as long as Japanese troops did not enter Vietnam, preventing them from crossing the Vietnamese border. However, reliable information has now been received that Japan is determined to send troops to land in Vietnam and take other military actions within Vietnam to attack Chinese territory. The Chinese government hereby solemnly declares that if Japanese armed forces invade Vietnam, regardless of the pretext used or the circumstances, the Chinese government will consider this a direct and imminent threat to the security of Chinese territory and will immediately dispatch armed forces to enter Vietnam to take self-defense measures to deal with the situation. The Chinese government will not be responsible for any consequences arising from taking such necessary measures. If the French authorities in Vietnam permit or tolerate any Japanese military action, the French government cannot avoid responsibility for all consequences arising therefrom, including all physical and property losses suffered by Chinese expatriates in Vietnam.

In denying that Chinese troops had crossed the Vietnamese border, Gu stated that this news may have been a misunderstanding caused by Chinese soldiers getting lost in Yunnan Province. Gu emphasized that the Chinese government has repeatedly reiterated to France its guarantee to respect the Vietnamese border, and that Chinese troops will never enter the Vietnamese border unless Japanese troops land in Vietnam.

Editorial

### The Competition Between Britain and Italy

Today's European war is evidently being conducted on two separate theaters, the North Sea and the Middle East, with Britain and Germany and Britain and Italy as the main belligerents, respectively. In terms of content, both are struggles for hegemony between Britain and the Axis powers, but their forms of operation and development trends are quite different. The Middle East is much more complex than the North Sea. Recently, between Britain and Germany, there have been massive air raids for mutual destruction and revenge, as well as long-delayed blitzkriegs, but there is nothing else worthy of attention. In the Middle East and the Mediterranean, the Somaliland war has just ended, and tensions are rising again between Italian Libya and Egypt. The Italian-Greek dispute has not yet been definitively resolved, and Spain's participation in the war is also imminent. Complex and intricate, it is dizzying. If it is said that the scope of the Northern European war has narrowed and concentrated since Germany launched its offensive on the Western Front, then the situation in the Middle East has been continuing to spread and expand since Italy entered the war.

The totalitarian state's internal rule and prestige are tied to its achievements in external adventurous expansion, especially in resource-poor Italy. For many years, Italy's imperial ambitions have developed in three directions: Eastern Europe, North Africa, and the Western Mediterranean, with the aim of monopolizing the Mediterranean as its most pressing demand. But in terms of its achievements, Italy's efforts in Eastern Europe have been frustrated by the merger of Germany and Austria and the expansion of Nazi power into the Danube region. In North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula, even though it has staked its national strength, it has still only achieved partial gains, far from the dream of restoring the territory of the ancient Roman Empire. Therefore, Italy's participation in the European war this time is by no means simply to cooperate with Germany's needs, but mainly to complete its expansionist ambitions. In this regard, there is undoubtedly a tacit understanding between Germany and Italy, and Germany inevitably has to let Italy develop in the Mediterranean and Northeast Africa as the price for Italy's participation in the war and withdrawal from Eastern Europe.

These two Axis countries are currently fighting side by side and have repeatedly vowed that their alliance will last forever. At this point, it is not necessary to assert that there is some kind of contradiction between the two. But Germany is focusing all its efforts on defeating Britain as its only current goal and does not want to create additional complications to divert its strength. Italy, on the other hand, attaches more importance to gaining hegemony in the Mediterranean and North Africa. From the Red Sea coast to the African hinterland to Gibraltar and Tangier, all are objects of Italy's desire, and its targets may not be limited to Britain and its possessions without extending to other countries. In this regard, there is a kind of psychological and even strategic difference between Germany and Italy beyond tacit understanding, which cannot be eliminated by simply emphasizing their consistent steps. After France's acceptance of the terms of surrender, Germany has not made any negative comments about Pétain, while Italy frequently accuses France of breaking its promises and reveals its resentment towards France. For example, in the recent Italian-Greek dispute, Italian public opinion is extremely tense, while Germany's attitude is quite cautious, obviously unwilling to see the war expand to the Balkans and affect the attitude of Turkey and the Soviet Union. Although Italian-Greek relations have been tense to the extreme in recent days, they have still remained in the tense stage and have occasionally eased slightly. In short, the fact that war has not yet broken out is probably the result of Germany's intervention. Another example is the armed conflict between Romania and Hungary that was reported yesterday, which is also something that Germany does not want to see. If possible, Germany will definitely try to prevent its expansion.

However, in any case, if Britain is unable to use overwhelming force to force Italy to adopt a defensive posture, the trend of the war in the Mediterranean and the Near East will inevitably continue to expand. Even if the turmoil in the Aegean and Adriatic Seas suddenly passes, it will inevitably turn to Egypt or the Arabian Peninsula. In order to connect its East African possessions with its mainland, Italy will not hesitate to prepare to break through the British blockade of the Suez Canal and the waterways at a great cost. In order to protect its oil sources in the Near East and the gateway between the Mediterranean waterways and the Indian Ocean, Britain will inevitably gather all its strength in the Near East and the Mediterranean to deal with the situation. The task in this regard is mainly undertaken by Italy alone. Comparing the strength of the two sides, Britain is on one side while Italy is on all sides. The three services of the sea, land, and air see each other's strengths and weaknesses, and it is difficult to measure their sum. Italy has already achieved a preliminary victory in Somaliland, but its final gains and losses will still depend on the advances and retreats of both sides in Aden, Egypt, and Gibraltar. This battle will determine who the hegemony of the Mediterranean belongs to and can also determine half of the fate of the British Empire.

### Japanese Prime Minister Announces No One-Party System, New Political System Preparatory Committee Convened Yesterday, to Plan a Permanent Institution

Tokyo: Prime Minister Konoe's statement on the new national political system is said to be released this afternoon. (28th Reuters dispatch)

Tokyo: Prime Minister Konoe delivered a speech this afternoon at the opening meeting of the preparatory committee for drafting the new political system, saying that the concept of one-party rule contradicts the basic principles of Japan's national policy of "ruling all the people" and asked the committee to plan an institution so that all people can assist the Emperor, because it is Japan's permanent and final law. Konoe stressed that there is an urgent need to build a new political system in all aspects of national and people's lives (such as politics, economy, education, and culture), but this new political system cannot allow the adoption of a one-party system, because no matter how well this system works in other countries, it cannot be accepted in Japan because it violates the basic principles of Japan's national policy of "ruling all the people." The meaning of this new political system is a permanent organization that encompasses the entire country, so that all classes of people in Japan can fulfill their responsibility to assist the Emperor. Assisting the Emperor is the privilege of his people, and this privilege cannot be monopolized by the power of one person or one party. If opinions differ on the assistance provided, the final decision will be made by the Emperor. Once the Emperor makes a decision, all people must unite and obey his orders. This is the true essence of Japanese policy. The government is now making its best efforts to achieve this goal, and the convocation of the preparatory committee is based on this intention. He specifically requested the cooperation of the committee. The purpose of the new political system is to unite the total efforts of the country and the people, so that our 100 million people become a living whole and can all fulfill their responsibilities as Japanese subjects.

### Conflict on the Soviet-Romanian, Hungarian-Romanian Border - Balkan Powder Keg Ready to Explode - Axis Powers Convene Meeting in Vienna - Invite Hungary and Romania to Participate to Eliminate War Crisis

The fierce clashes between Soviet and Romanian troops on the border, as well as the engagement of Romanian and Hungarian aircraft over Hungary, have made war in the Balkans unavoidable. Political circles here are quite fearful that the Soviet Union will immediately invade Romania. As for the tense situation between Hungary and Romania, it is believed that because it is approaching its peak, it may also lead to conflict. The Soviet-Romanian border conflict occurred yesterday. According to the Soviet side, 500 Romanian soldiers have died. Although the actual battle situation is not considered excessively serious, observers here say that because the Soviet Union may launch a formal offensive against this small country immediately, any further firing should not be taken lightly. The Romanian-Hungarian air battle took place over Debrecen, Hungary, which is 20 miles from the Romanian border and 114 miles east of Budapest. According to Hungarian reports, the pilot of a Romanian fighter attacked a Hungarian heavy bomber. The Hungarian pilot was injured and forced to land. (International Dispatch, 28th)

London - According to German radio news, the foreign ministers of Germany, Italy, Romania, and Hungary are scheduled to meet in Vienna tomorrow to discuss matters of common interest.

The news of conflicts on the Romanian border indicates that tensions between Romania and its neighbors have increased. It is reported that a total of 50 people were injured or killed in the Soviet-Romanian clashes, and one Soviet and one Romanian aircraft were shot down at the new Soviet-Romanian border. In addition, a Romanian fighter plane caused an accident on the Romanian-Hungarian border.

Italian Anti-Greek Propaganda Still Not Halted - Soviet Union's Position Pivotal

London - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent states that Italian newspaper and radio anti-Greek propaganda has not diminished to date, but the situation has not significantly deteriorated. There are currently no new signs that Italy intends to destroy Balkan peace itself or use Albania as a tool to attack Greece. Although Italy may test the effectiveness of Britain's guarantee to Greece, the possibility of using Albanian troops to achieve its goals cannot be ignored. However, this development may not be entirely beneficial to Italy, so it is still very doubtful whether Italy is willing to truly go to extremes. There is reason to believe that the Germans are not entirely in agreement with Mussolini's approach to Greek Prime Minister Metaxas. If Italy can obtain strategic Greek areas such as Crete as naval and air bases without war, it would be a victory. However, Greece has not shown any signs of yielding to Italy or succumbing to Italian intimidation. Italian newspapers have repeatedly threatened Greece with the possibility of disputes arising on the northeastern Greek border, and have stated that the Bulgarian government has now convened reservists. However, it has been heard that the British government has received assurances that the Italian newspapers' statements are completely unfounded and that the Bulgarian government sincerely declares that it does not intend to take any anti-Greek action. The success of the negotiations between Romania and Bulgaria regarding Southern Dobruja is the most encouraging result of the policy of revising borders by peaceful means, which is the firm aim of the Bulgarian government when engaging in negotiations. The Soviet Union currently adopts a position of non-interference in these various issues, but if the Balkans continue to be disturbed, the Soviet Union's position will be extremely important. There is no doubt about this. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)

### German Air Force Retaliates - Sixteen British Cities Bombed - London Area Under Frequent Air Raid Alerts All Night Long - Incendiary Bombs Dropped, Fires Erupt in Many Places

London - Yesterday, German invasion aircraft flew over the British coast and attacked at least 20 cities and towns, but the dense anti-aircraft fire network in central London drove back the German aircraft. London was attacked twice last night, with only half an hour between attacks. Countless incendiary bombs fell on the London area, and fires broke out in several places, which were extinguished. (United Press Dispatch, 28th)

London - Last night, large formations of German aircraft conducted the most extensive night raid on London since the start of the war. A German acoustic aircraft has been continuously bombing the London area for two nights. It is reported that German bombers and fighters flew over three cities in Wales, two cities in southeastern England, five cities in southwestern England, and six cities in the Midlands. The scope of the German air raids was extremely wide. In addition to London, 16 other British cities were attacked. This move was clearly a retaliation for the British Air Force's daytime air raids on 27 airfields in Germany, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Millions of London residents once again rushed into shelters upon hearing the air raid alarm. The general public was able to calmly obey air defense regulations. An International News Service reporter was in central London at the time and witnessed flashes of fire followed by loud explosions, indicating that the Germans were dropping bombs fiercely. Latest reports indicate that although the scope of the German night raid was wider than last night, the total losses were still less. The all-clear was sounded in London at 11:55 p.m. (8:55 a.m. Shanghai time). (International News Service Dispatch, 28th)

### Fierce Air Battle Over the Thames Estuary This Morning

London - This morning, German aircraft flew to the British coast again, but suffered losses after being intercepted by British fighters. According to responsible sources, a formation of German aircraft flew south over the Kent coast, and soon after, another large group of German aircraft flew over the northern Kent coast. Both of these formations were flying inland, but were intercepted by British fighters and a fierce battle took place in the sky between central Kent and the Thames Estuary. The German formations were driven back and suffered losses, but the details are still unknown. It is said that the air battle lasted for about half an hour. When German aircraft appeared over northeastern Britain this morning, a passenger train was strafed by German aircraft, and the roof of the train was hit by bullets, but fortunately no passengers were injured. This afternoon, 24 German bombers attacked a city on the southeastern coast, dropping several bombs and destroying several buildings, but only one person was injured in the arm by the bombing. According to an Air Ministry communiqué issued this afternoon, the activities of German aircraft this morning were almost entirely limited to attempting to penetrate British defenses in the Thames Estuary and Kent, but the German aircraft were intercepted and driven back by British aircraft. It is reported that six German aircraft were shot down by British fighters in air battles. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)

### British Aircraft Bomb German, Dutch, French, and Belgian Territories - 27 Airfields Bombed

London - The Air Ministry stated that on August 26, the British Air Force dispatched bombers to attack enemy airfields by day, and expanded the scope of these attacks at night. 17 airfields in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and occupied France were bombed. A British bomber shot down an enemy aircraft returning from British territory over Nivelles airfield while flying back from Germany. In addition to attacking targets in Italy, British bomber formations used their main force to heavily bomb the artificial oil plant in Lützkendorf west of Leipzig, Germany; the oil storage depot and aircraft factory in Frankfurt; and the explosives factory in the suburbs. Targets in Cologne and military supply depots in Hamm were also attacked. British aircraft were active throughout the night, and all but one returned safely. One aircraft was also missing from the daytime raids. Further details released by the Air Ministry's Information Office stated that one of the main targets attacked in Germany, the dye factory in Lützkendorf, was heavily damaged in a bombing raid on August 16. This factory is one of the largest chemical plants in the world. During the British aircraft's last attack, the first batch failed to find the target due to clouds and smoke obscuring the view, but the British aircraft that arrived later found the factory and bombed it. One aircraft dropped several bombs directly on the target, and it was seen that at least two bombs hit the main building. Four minutes later, another British aircraft dropped bombs, and blue light was seen to be emitted. Fires broke out throughout the attacked area. Another British aircraft continued to drop bombs on the main building, hitting it and causing a loud explosion. The attack lasted for two hours, but the details of the results could not be seen clearly due to intense anti-aircraft fire and low-lying clouds. The British aircraft's attack on the oil refinery in Frankfurt was also very successful, dropping 50 high-explosive bombs and over 400 incendiary bombs. Fires were seen breaking out everywhere. The aircraft frame manufacturing plant in the area was also bombed, and six houses caught fire. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)

### Total British Aircraft Losses - 943 Aircraft

### U.S. Clarifies Position to Japan - Determined to Protect Far East Interests - Rumored Secret Cooperation Agreement Between U.S. and Britain - Carlson and Others Request Aid to China

Washington - According to the New York Times, the United States will insist on protecting American rights in the Far East. U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew is constantly negotiating with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka, and Admiral Hart is also handling negotiations with the Japanese authorities in Shanghai. These talks are not limited to the Shanghai issue, but also explain the United States' general position to the Japanese government. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 28th)

Washington - Senator Holt, a Democrat from West Virginia, told the Senate yesterday that "it is widely believed that the United States has entered into a secret agreement with Britain" to cooperate jointly in the Far East. Senator Holt stated that although the government has not announced this matter to the country, "the administrative authorities know that this agreement actually exists." He also stated that after various details are revealed in the future, we will know that "this understanding established by the administrative authorities is more than any other mechanism." Senator Lundeen, a Farmer-Labor Party member from Minnesota, also criticized the impropriety of this action by the United States and warned that if the United States forms an agreement with Britain in Asia, there is a risk of dragging the U.S. into the whirlpool of war. He declared, "If Japan goes to war with our country, the war will not be held in the Hawaiian Islands or near San Francisco. The war will be on the Sea of Japan, at which time we must extend our lines of communication to 5,000 or 7,000 miles." The remarks of Senators Holt and Lundeen temporarily halted the ongoing debate on the conscription bill. (United Press Dispatch, 28th)

Manila - Retired U.S. Marine Corps Major Carlson and British-New Zealander writer and war correspondent Bertrand last night both stated that the United States should adopt a firm stance in the Far East and urged that China be given all necessary assistance for the war. In succession, they delivered speeches, saying that "they are currently witnessing the possibility of a repeat of the Munich incident in the Far East, and they deeply condemn this move." Major Carlson stated, "If we adopt a policy of appeasement in the Far East, 'we will be marching towards Waterloo,' not merely repeating 'Munich.' The consequences of adopting a policy of appeasement will be that our prestige, our reputation for fairness, and our courage to firmly implement what we believe to be correct will all be lost." Bertrand stated that if the United States does not announce its definite policy, there is a possibility of direct cooperation between Britain and Japan. He believes that Britain's attitude towards the Far East is currently influenced by the European war, the unrest in India, and the evolution of its relationship with the Far East and its Pacific colonies. These speeches were initiated by the Philippine-China Industrial Cooperation Association, and were followed by a public question and answer session. Bertrand contrasted the United States' firm Far East policy with Britain's "wavering" policy. He called for the two countries to join hands in the East as soon as possible. Bertrand also contrasted New Zealand's attitude towards Japan with that of its mother country (Britain). He pointed out that New Zealand, in cooperation with Australia, was the first country to embargo war materials to Japan. Regarding the Australian fantasy that Japan and the Soviet Union could go to war, he said, "A war between Japan and the Soviet Union, as foreign writers and famous journalists Duranty have said, is most welcome to the world. The entire world would enthusiastically applaud, hoping that both sides would suffer defeat." Major Carlson stated, "If we can adopt a firm stance in the Far East and give China all the assistance it needs for the war, I believe that we can bring both the army and navy factions in Japan, who are vying for power, into line, and allow all peace-loving and secure people in Asia, including the Japanese, to be liberated."

### Shigemitsu Discusses Desire for Anglo-Japanese Understanding

London (Reuters Diplomatic Correspondent) - Foreign and Japanese newspapers have offered various interpretations of the Japanese government's recall of 40 diplomats to Tokyo. However, the following remarks by Shigemitsu Mamoru, the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, may be regarded as a responsible Japanese critique of Foreign Minister Matsuoka's surprising decision. Shigemitsu said, "I wish to clarify that the recall of the heads of diplomatic missions does not imply any change in the Japanese diplomatic policy recently decided upon by the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. My mission in London to seek genuine Anglo-Japanese understanding has the full support of the Japanese government. The Japanese government and I personally earnestly desire to place Anglo-Japanese relations on a solid foundation." (Reuters, 28th)

### Honda Advocates Tough Stance Toward the US

Tokyo - Honda, the former Japanese Ambassador to Germany, published an article in "Nichinichi Shimbun" today, advocating a tough stance toward the US. He argued that only in this way could the US be induced to change its policy of restricting trade with Japan. Honda proposed that Japan should take countermeasures against the US to harm its commercial interests, such as declaring a blockade of the entire Chinese coast under belligerent status, which would prevent the US from obtaining tungsten ore from China. At the same time, Japan should cut off the US trade routes in the South Sea and Southeast Asia, making it impossible for the US to obtain rubber and tin. The Japanese government should also formally inform the US that "We can cut off your major trade routes." (Haitong News Agency, 28th)

US Senators Express Opinions on Conscription Bill

Washington - Senator Johnson, a Democrat from Colorado, expressed his opinion in the Senate yesterday during the debate on the Burke-Wadsworth Conscription Bill. He said that if the bill were passed, it would inevitably lead the US into a military dictatorship. Johnson believed that the conscription bill was the most radical means of detaching the US from its inherent traditions and the first step in creating a military state. Johnson also said that conscription not only does no good for national defense but also damages strong modern national defense. Senator Tydings, a Democrat from Maryland, also opposed the conscription bill, but said that it was better to have conscription in advance and not use it than not to have it at all. Tydings also replied to Senator Taft, a Republican from Ohio, saying that Taft's claim that a sufficient number of volunteers could be obtained without conscription was theoretically naive. (United Press, 28th)

### McNary Delivers Speech

Salem, Oregon - McNary, the Republican candidate for US Vice President, delivered a formal speech last night accepting the Republican nomination, denouncing the policy of appeasement toward European dictatorships and advocating self-strengthening for the US. He said, "Maintaining peace in the Western Hemisphere is the most urgent task. The aggressive European absolutists have exceeded George III of Britain and Napoleon I of France in previous history." He also said, "This is by no means an ordinary election. The wars beyond the two oceans, the Atlantic and the Pacific, and the peace in the Western Hemisphere that we urgently desire to maintain, have surrounded our political direction and forced us to decide with great effort. Domestic politics and foreign relations are both of great importance in the current situation. We have been lingering in the face of the tide for more than seven years. We have been extremely negligent in defense, both spiritually and materially. The great capabilities of the US have been hindered, and some people have lost faith in the future of our country and the work of the 'source of happiness.' No party is strictly responsible for these facts. Our minority party may not pay attention to this, but this responsibility belongs to the powerful party. This election is not merely a competition between two rival parties but a competition on political philosophy, in other words, a competition on the philosophy of government action. Whether the US will continue to move forward on its historical mission or retreat to a useless position, this is the question we are choosing at this time." (United Press, 28th)

### Defense Zone Issue Temporarily Subsides; US Insists on Fair Method; No Japanese Takeover of Central Zone Allowed; Merchant Corps Patrol in Rotation, No Security Concerns

In the middle of this month, the commanders of the defense forces of various countries decided that the Ding District would be taken over by the Japanese army and the Yi District would be taken over by the US army. However, the Japanese side insisted on taking over the entire British army defense zone and has so far refused to move in. The above two defense zones are temporarily defended by the First Team of the International Merchant Corps and the White Russian Team to maintain order. However, this measure is only temporary, and the future depends on the outcome of the diplomatic negotiations between the US and Japan. According to sources, the analysis of the defense zone issue between the US and Japan is currently still in progress in Washington and Tokyo. Although it is difficult to know the progress, it is quite clear that the Japanese side is determined to take over the entire British army defense zone. According to general observation, the US side may not make further concessions and will insist on a fair distribution method. If the Yi District is also taken over by the Japanese side, the situation in the concession and the interests of Britain and the United States will be worrying.

Current Situation in Ding District

Since the British army withdrew, the defense of the Ding District has been temporarily taken over by the White Russian Team of the International Merchant Corps. The reporter went to the area for inspection yesterday and saw that the British army barracks on Great Western Road are now stationed by fifty to sixty members of the White Russian Regiment, assisted by a large number of Chinese and Western patrolmen. However, because the number of people is still very different from the previous British army stationed there, there is a sense of emptiness in terms of defense. When the British army was stationed in the area, high sand castles were built at Yidingpan Road, Yu Garden Road, Great Western Road, the end of Yidingpan Road, the end of Bailinan Road, and Anhe Temple Road for defense. Now, most of these sand castles have been demolished for unknown reasons, and a small part has collapsed to the side, with sand and gravel all over the ground. Although the Japanese side refuses to take over the Ding District, the Japanese forces have gradually penetrated. The gambling den in the Great Western Road Concert Palace has now been changed to the headquarters of the Japanese Military Police, with four Japanese soldiers stationed there. At the intersections of Yu Garden Road, Yidingpan Road, and Great Western Road and Yidingpan Road, where concession patrolmen and "police" used to stand guard to direct traffic, now only "police" are standing guard.

No New Developments

The spokesman of the Japanese Embassy stated at the press conference yesterday that he had not yet received a formal report from Tokyo regarding the news released by the Alliance News Agency that the issue of re-distributing the defense zones of the Shanghai Public Concession would be resolved locally, so he could not confirm it. The news released by the Alliance News Agency stated that the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo stated at a press conference with Western reporters that the defense zone issue was purely a local issue and should be resolved locally. When the reporter asked the embassy spokesman here whether there were any negotiations in progress in Shanghai, he replied that he would not answer this question for the time being and would answer it in the near future. The US Navy Fourth Marine Regiment authorities did not make any statement on this matter yesterday.

Merchant Corps Garrisoning is of Great Importance

The North-China Daily News stated that the Public Concession "Yi" Defense Zone was recently taken over temporarily by the International Merchant Corps due to the withdrawal of the British army. It is found that the members of the Merchant Corps are merchants in this city, and some of them work in foreign merchant firms, especially those in smaller firms. If they want to leave their jobs to defend the "Yi" District, their bosses are unwilling to give them the necessary convenience, and they consider the departure of the Merchant Corps members to be an unfair burden on them.

Regarding this matter, Fei Lipu, the Director-General and Chairman of the Public Works Bureau, stated yesterday (the 27th) that the duties currently performed by the Merchant Corps in the "Yi" Defense Zone are of great importance. The Public Works Bureau is very clear that it is not appropriate to ask the Merchant Corps to engage in any work that is unnecessary for the public interest. It is hoped that all bosses will cooperate with the Public Works Bureau so that their employees who join the Merchant Corps can easily leave their jobs to carry out defense duties. According to the recent meeting of the Defense Army Command Committee,

Decision Plan

The "Yi" Defense Zone will be handed over to the US Navy Fourth Marine Regiment. The Japanese representative objected. At that time, it was generally believed that the Japanese authorities would ask the committee to reconvene to discuss the counter-proposals put forward by the Japanese side. However, it was learned yesterday that the Japanese side had not yet requested the defense army commander to hold another meeting. Also, the Shanghai Times stated that the A Battalion of the International Merchant Corps has been garrisoning the "Yi" District for a week. Last night at 8 o'clock, it was replaced by the Merchant Corps Cavalry Team and Armored Vehicle Team. In less than a week, or it will be transferred by the A Battalion.

### Police Liaison to Curb Violence; Two Concessions and Japanese Side Form Police Liaison Committee

The English-language "China Press" reported that the Shanghai Consular Body sent a letter to Ke Zaiwei, Director-General of the Public Works Bureau, on August 12, stating the resolution passed by the Consular Body regarding the issue of terrorist activities in Shanghai. Ke Zaiwei convened a meeting in the meeting room of the Public Works Bureau yesterday (the 27th). Japanese Consul Miura and Chuanshao'an, and Morelet, the police chief of the French Concession (representing Consul General Ogen, who is away from Shanghai), were present.

Meeting Decision

The meeting started at 3 pm and decided that the police authorities of the four parties would organize a liaison committee to concentrate their efforts and cooperate to suppress terrorist activities in Shanghai. In the proposed liaison committee,

Number of Meetings

Will meet at least twice a month to discuss the steps taken by the police separately and decide on what joint plans. According to sources, if all parties cooperate in implementing the plan, it will greatly improve the prevention of violence.

### Church Hospital Bombed; US Will Protest; Waiting for Guilin Report

Regarding the bombing of the hospital established by the American Baptist Church in Guilin by Japanese aircraft, Smith, the secretary of the General Association here, said yesterday that the reports received here about this matter were not very detailed. Therefore, the General Association sent a telegram to the hospital in Guilin the day before yesterday to inquire about the detailed truth, but has not received a reply as of yesterday. He said that after receiving a detailed telegram report, he will ask the US Consulate General here to protest to the Japanese side.

### Redemption of British Gold Notes to End at Midnight Today; Deadline for National Government's Negotiation to Extend Two Days Expires; Limited Number of Notes in This City, No Impact

In order to prevent British pound notes from being seized by Germans and transferred to neutral countries to obtain foreign exchange in London, Britain decided to ban the import of British notes. However, in order to take into account the interests of note holders in neutral countries, a considerable period was given so that neutral countries could collect the British notes and send them to Britain. In Shanghai, from August 22, it was originally scheduled to end at midnight on the 27th. As a result of the National Government's negotiation, it was decided to extend the period for two days, which expires at midnight today.

Notes Stored in This City

British notes have been decreasing since the outbreak of the European War. Most collectors have already sold them, so the impact on this city is limited. The overseas circulation of British notes is the largest in northern France. When the German and French forces clashed, the British army went to France to provide assistance, and the army's salaries were paid in British pounds. According to the Anglo-French wartime currency agreement, British pounds could circulate freely in France. Now that northern France has fallen, the British government has banned the return of British notes in order to prevent large amounts of British pounds from falling into the hands of the German army. The world's oldest free currency has also been restricted due to the changing situation. Those who hoard foreign currencies in the isolated island should be alerted. It is heard that after the redemption period expires, there may be a way to obtain proof of reconciliation for British notes in Shanghai and Hong Kong.

Bank of China

Shanghai Branch and British banks such as HSBC, McCallum, and Chartered Bank have learned that the above banks have decided to extend the redemption of British notes for two days, until August 29. Starting from the morning of the 30th, they will no longer redeem them. The redemption of the Bank of China is converted at the statutory price of the Ministry of Finance, which is 45 yuan, 7 jiao, and 1 fen based on yesterday's market price. Today's redemption price will be converted based on the exchange rate again. However, in order to take into account the interests of Chinese holders of British notes, all Chinese holders of British notes can apply for exchange for legal tender and are not restricted. However, British banks only limit the exchange to their respective customers.

Money Exchange Guild

It was originally scheduled to stop buying and selling British gold notes yesterday, but because the bank redemption was extended for two days, it was decided to continue to buy and sell today and tomorrow. Starting from the 30th, it is planned to no longer buy and sell. Yesterday's buying price for British gold notes was 93 yuan of national currency per pound, but small notes of half a pound and one pound were further lowered by 10 to 20 cents. Because there were no buyers, there was no selling price. As for British gold pounds, because they are gold pounds and not notes, the market price is still listed as usual, and money exchange dealers still handle the buying and selling. Since yesterday, it has been heard that some small money shops have refused to accept British notes.

### Saigon and Haiphong Shipping Lines; Shanghai Shipping Has Stopped; Vietnam Situation Gradually Tense; Guangzhou Bay Also Suspended

Recently, the situation in Vietnam has become increasingly tense, and rumors have been rampant. In order to prevent it, the Vietnamese authorities have reportedly automatically blockaded coastal ports such as Haiphong and Saigon. Whether it will be implemented is still uncertain. It is heard that the Hong Kong-Vietnam shipping line has been interrupted. The ships of Taikoo and Jardine companies that operate the Shanghai-Vietnam line have also been ordered by the Hong Kong line to stop sailing to Saigon and Haiphong.

Ports for Each Shipment

Therefore, the Jardine Matheson & Co.'s "Mingsheng" wheel, which was originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Haiphong this afternoon, will only go to Hong Kong. The Taikoo Company's "Qingyuan" wheel, which was originally scheduled to sail to Haiphong tomorrow morning, has also been changed to Haikou. Guangzhou Bay has been suspended, and Xiamen and Hong Kong are still open. Jardine Matheson & Co.'s "Taisheng" shipment is scheduled to go from Shanghai to Hong Kong on September 3. It is still scheduled to sail to Haiphong. Whether it can be completed depends on the situation at that time. The Taikoo Company's "Shandong" wheel sailed from Shanghai to Haiphong on the morning of the 25th, also stopping at Xiamen, Hong Kong, Haikou, and Guangzhou Bay. It is expected to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow, and it has now been ordered to stop sailing to Guangzhou Bay and Haiphong. The shipment has very little cargo, only more than 20 pieces. When the time comes, it will be stored on the dock in Hong Kong.

Vietnam Situation Gradually Tense

According to sources in the shipping industry, after hearing about the tense situation in Vietnam, various shipping companies telegraphed the Vietnamese side to inquire. All have received replies this morning, saying that the situation is not good and that the ships should sail slowly. However, according to the French Postal Company here, "The company has not yet received any telegrams from Haiphong regarding the situation. The French Postal Company's 'Xijiang' ship, which went directly to Haiphong on the 25th, is expected to arrive at its destination on the 30th. The company has not received any unexpected telegrams."

Scheduled Flights

Also, according to reporters from the Pingming News Agency who inquired at the local office of the British Royal Aviation Company, it is said that due to the current situation, the European-Asian airline schedule has been disordered. The schedule was originally two flights per week, flying from Hong Kong, transiting in Bangkok and Singapore, and then to Europe. However, due to the tense situation, the schedule is uncertain and very sparse. Therefore, people in this city who want to purchase tickets from the airline must contact the local office and then the office must telegraph Hong Kong again, which takes a long time. As for the Hong Kong-Vietnam airline, it is still operated by the French airline.

### Public Concession to Exchange Permits; Old Permits Invalid from October 1

The Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Bureau issued a notice yesterday, stating, "The curfew permits issued by the police station when the Shanghai War broke out have been more than three years ago and have not been reissued, which has caused many problems. Therefore, the Public Works Bureau hereby announces that all curfew permits previously issued by the police station will be invalid from October 1 of this year, and new permits will be reissued. Each permit will cost two yuan of national currency, but it must be approved by the police station that there is a real need for a permit before it can be issued. To apply for a new permit, please obtain a blank application form from office number 310 of the police station at 185 Fuzhou Road."

### Feng Zhizhong Shot and Injured Yesterday; Two Bullets Hit His Buttocks, Condition Not Serious; Assailant Arrested, Shot in Vital Areas and Died; Stray Bullets Injured as Many as Five Pedestrians

Yesterday afternoon at 1:20 PM, another assassination case occurred in the French Concession. The victim was Feng Zhizhong, secretary of the Sino-French Friendship Association. He was shot twice in the buttocks. The assailant fled on a bicycle after the incident but was intercepted by French Concession detectives on Avenue Edward VII. The detectives shot and wounded his arm on the spot. The following is an investigation report by our reporter:

Encountering an Ambush

Feng Zhizhong, a native of Guangdong, is 47 years old. He resides at No. 25, Lane 550 (Bubbling Well Road) of Avenue Albert in the French Concession. He once served as an editor for the Shanghai French-language newspaper and then resigned. He is currently the secretary of the Sino-French Friendship Association at No. 577 Route Lafayette, but the association only recognizes him as a member. Yesterday at 1:30 PM, Feng was riding a rickshaw home when, upon passing the front of No. 546 Avenue Albert, a man dressed in blue overalls on a bicycle suddenly caught up, drew a pistol, and shot at Feng. Feng, upon hearing the gunshot, abandoned the rickshaw and attempted to escape. The assailant pursued him, firing shots. Two bullets hit his buttocks, causing him to fall to the ground in extreme pain, with blood flowing profusely.

Police Pursuit

Upon hearing the gunshot, a policeman from post No. 195 nearby immediately drew his pistol and rushed to the scene. Seeing this, the assailant rode his bicycle eastward along Avenue Albert towards Avenue Foch. The policeman blew his whistle and pursued relentlessly, firing shots at him. The assailant returned fire. Upon reaching the entrance of the General Police Station at No. 47 Avenue Foch, some French detectives were having lunch inside. Hearing the whistle, they all drew their guns and came out to investigate. The assailant became even more flustered and fired his gun wildly.

Died from Gunshot Wounds

He hastily turned from Avenue Foch into Rue Pere Robert, and then attempted to escape towards Avenue Road. The detectives still pursued relentlessly. When the assailant tried to fire at the detectives again, he found that his bullets were all used up. When he reached the back gate of No. 2 Avenue Road, a French Concession police car No. 2626 happened to be passing by. Witnessing the situation, they drew their guns and opened fire, hitting him in the back, chest, arm, and other parts of his body. He fell off the bicycle, landing on a woman. He was holding a six-round revolver in his hand.

Stray Bullets Injure People

The woman was Shen Chen, 32 years old, a native of Ningbo, residing at No. 12 Avenue Road. Yesterday afternoon, she was taking her children out when she unfortunately encountered this accident. She suffered a slight head injury. Her son, Shen Wenlu, 13 years old, was injured in the left leg. Her daughter, Shen Yuexiu, 19 years old, was injured in the kidney area. Two other pedestrians were also injured: Yao Peizhen, 10 years old, a native of Jinshan, was injured in the leg by a stray bullet, and He Acai, 16 years old, a local, was injured in the left back by a stray bullet. The French Concession police called ambulances and sent Feng, the injured persons, and the assailant to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The assailant died from injuries to vital areas upon arrival at the hospital. Feng's injuries were not serious. He Acai among the pedestrians was seriously injured. The police are currently conducting a thorough investigation into the reasons for Feng's assassination.

Feng's Background

It is found that Feng once served as the principal of the Sino-French Drama School and later organized the Sino-French Drama Society, once performing the play "Poppy." Later, the school and the drama society dissolved de facto. Feng's wife is also from Guangdong.

### New Committee Established by the Municipal Council to Study Future Election Politics; Discussion on Whether to Change Election Procedures; Six People Including Allman Appointed as Committee Members

The Municipal Council's announcement yesterday morning (the 28th) foreshadows that the procedures for electing directors in the future may be changed. The announcement stated that the Council has invited six taxpayers, including Allman, Fema-Gary, Gless, Mitchell, Sauveaire, and Yasui Gengo, to form a committee to study what changes should be made to the election procedures.

Current Regulations Not to be Modified

Yesterday, a spokesperson for the Municipal Council told a Western newspaper reporter that the newly established election committee will amend the existing election laws. It is said that the committee established yesterday will only study whether some details of the election procedures need to be changed in order to make next year's voting more convenient. The spokesperson also stated that this committee was organized by the Municipal Council on its own initiative and was not established at the request of Japanese residents in this port, as reported by "Lixinbao." Regarding the Japanese newspaper's claim that "the failure of this year's election of three additional Japanese directors was due to imperfections in some voting regulations, and the Municipal Council has agreed to amend these regulations," the spokesperson pointed out that the new committee has no power to amend the current voting law. He said that this law is part of the Shanghai Land Regulations, formulated by the signatory powers, and cannot be changed without the consent of these powers. As for when the committee will hold its first meeting and what points of the election procedure will be reviewed, the Municipal Council did not specify.

Internal City Public Officials Restricted from Entering the Concession

During the War of Resistance, public officials who went abroad, to the concession, or to the occupied cities under the pretext of official business were strictly restricted by the National Government in order to maintain their posts. It is learned that the Zhejiang Provincial Government, in view of the proximity to Shanghai and the areas occupied by the Japanese army, and that some public officials, without special assignments and without prior approval, still secretly went there under various pretexts, has reissued an order: hereafter, all public officials in the province, unless they have been approved by the provincial government and issued a certificate, are strictly prohibited from going there. The inspection agencies should conduct strict inspections. If any public official is found going to the above-mentioned areas without a certificate approved by the provincial government, they may be detained and reported for investigation.

### Municipal Council Deputy Secretary-General Gobbert Returns to England to Join the Army; Gobbert Has Achieved Considerable Merit in Five Years of Political Service; Loves Shanghai and Hopes to Return Someday

Submitted Resignation, Will Leave Here in Mid-September

The English "Demei Evening News" reports that Gobbert, Deputy Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, has recently submitted his resignation and may leave Shanghai in mid-September to join the British Army. It is heard that Gobbert has been planning to join the army for some time, and he is expected to receive an officer's rank when he officially enlists. It is learned that Gobbert has served the Municipal Council for five years and has done his best in his duties.

Remarkable Achievements

At the beginning of 1938, during Philippe's long leave of absence, Gobbert served as acting secretary-general and president, presiding over the affairs of the secretary-general's office. At that time, the Shanghai war had just ended, and the situation in the city was complex, so it was particularly difficult to handle affairs. Recently, Gobbert has worked hard to improve the

City's Rice Situation

Although there were many obstacles due to the lack of rice from the inland being transported to Shanghai, Gobbert's efforts have achieved remarkable success. Gobbert is 32 years old, grew up in South Africa, and returned to England at the age of 18. He studied at Oxford University and obtained a law degree. After graduating, he specialized in economics. According to Gobbert's statement to reporters this morning, he is very

Fond of Shanghai

and cannot help but feel sad upon leaving. However, Gobbert smiled and declined to elaborate on his five years of experience serving the Municipal Council, only saying that he felt very happy in Shanghai and certainly hopes to return someday. Gobbert also said that he has a younger brother who lives in the United States and has become an American citizen, but he has recently gone to Canada to join the British Air Force. It is heard that Gobbert's successor has not yet been decided, but Nash, the Municipal Council's assistant secretary-general, has the highest hopes.

### French Chief Inspector Fabre Flies from Qingdao to Shanghai; Pullen Greatly Improved; Chief Inspector Conducting Thorough Investigation

Fabre, the French Chief Inspector of the Shanghai French Concession Police, was originally on vacation in Qingdao. After receiving news that six rioters intended to harm Acting Chief Inspector Pullen, he flew from Qingdao and arrived in Shanghai at 5:00 PM on Tuesday (the 27th), only nine hours after Pullen was assassinated and injured. After arriving in Shanghai, Fabre immediately returned to work. It is reported that he will conduct a thorough investigation into the unprecedented attack on a senior police officer. As for Pullen's condition, he has greatly improved and may be discharged from the hospital this weekend. According to records, the assassination of French Concession police officers has occurred three times in the past month. The first was Russian detective Ivanov, followed by detective Yang Gaoski, both of whom have died. However, this attack on a senior police officer is the first in the city's history.

### No Vegetables Available at Old Zha Gate Market Yesterday; Goods from Pudong Intercepted, Vegetable Prices Soared by 100%

The city's vegetables, in addition to some from the areas along the two railways, rely on supplies from Pudong, Zhenru, Longhua, and other places. However, since the establishment of the "Central Market" on Guangfu Road last winter, the Japanese side has also established a "Food Wholesale Market" in Hongkou, so that all kinds of vegetables (including eggs, game, and meat and vegetarian food) from Wenbei, Zhenru, Jiangwan, and Wusong are intercepted. Only Pudong and Longhua are still free to sell, but after being controlled by them, vegetable prices have soared by 50% due to heavy exploitation. This spring, the "Market" also established a "Branch Market" in western Shanghai, so currently only the Pudong route has no obstacles.

Pudong Goods Also Intercepted

Because the goods resold by the "Market" are more expensive than those sold directly by vendors, and most goods must be paid for and reserved early, small-scale stallholders are unwilling to purchase from them, and instead buy directly from vegetable farmers, rendering the "Market" nominal and incurring huge losses. Therefore, they have further established a "South City Branch Market" along Dongmen Road in Nanshi to intercept goods from the corner of Pudong.

Prices Doubled, Unprecedented

Due to the control and interception by the "Markets," vegetable farmers have no profit, leading to a sharp reduction in the goods arriving. All goods arriving in the port are completely controlled by the "Markets." The Old Zha Gate, originally a major base for the concentration of local goods, had no vegetables available yesterday, and prices soared by more than 100%. Green vegetables sold for nine yuan per dan (including the basket for weighing, and the basket is still taken back; originally sold for four or five yuan, and the basket was removed), lotus root sold for twelve yuan per hundred catties (originally sold for five or six yuan), and winter melon sold for four yuan and fifty cents (originally sold for two yuan and fifty cents). Therefore, the retail prices were: cabbage sold for three cents per catty, and other onions, chives, garlic, eggplants, and potatoes also increased by more than 100%, which is unprecedented.

### Japanese Warships off Zhenhai Port Bombarded Chuanshan and Shuangquan

The Zhejiang Provincial Shanghai Association received the following telegram from eastern Zhejiang yesterday: (1) At 6:58 AM the day before yesterday, a Japanese warship coming from east of Chuanshan fired eight shells. At 7:33 AM, the warship sailed eastward, direction unknown. (2) A Japanese warship anchored in front of Hengshan Ocean has sailed towards Ting Shuimen at 7:50 AM yesterday morning. (3) At 8:35 AM, a Japanese warship anchored in the sea off Dong Qimen, Hengshan, suddenly fired more than ten shells at Shuangquan Port without targeting anything. The shells landed on barren sand dunes, so there was no damage. At 10:50 AM, the Japanese warship also sailed eastward and left. (4) At about 3:50 PM the day before yesterday afternoon, another Japanese warship sailed to the sea off Dong Qimen and anchored in the sea off Qi Jiao, without any movement. (5) At 1:45 PM the day before yesterday afternoon, a Japanese aircraft was discovered over Songmen, intruding into Hai Dou for a short time. The Ningbo air defense哨 sent out an air raid warning and then an emergency warning ten minutes later. Then, the Japanese aircraft passed over Ningbo and then left the sea from Guan Haiwei, Cixi, and the alarm was lifted at 2:27 PM.

### American Association, etc. Public Banquet for Arnold

Arnold, the American Commercial Counselor to China, has been in China for 32 years. Now, he is retiring after completing his term of office and will return to his country on September 5. The American public groups in this port have set up farewell banquets one after another. The American Association has set the time for a public banquet for Mr. and Mrs. Arnold at 8:00 PM on September 2 at the club. Those who will participate at that time include the American University Association, the Shanghai American Returned Students Association, and other groups.

### Hurricane Approaching Northward

After the first typhoon in the Pacific landed in Hong Kong and then disappeared in western Guangdong, and the second typhoon swept across Japan and has also dissipated, the third typhoon, according to the report of the observatory at 6:00 AM yesterday, is now located at 17 degrees north latitude and 130 degrees east longitude, heading northwest by west, with the center within 120 nautical miles.

### British Commander of the China Fleet, Layton, Goes to Hong Kong to Take Office, Accompanied by British Ambassador Sir Kerr; Says Royal Air Force is Brave and Courageous

Sir Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, has been appointed Governor of Hong Kong by order of the government. His post as Commander-in-Chief will be temporarily replaced by Sir Layton. It is heard that Mr. and Mrs. Layton came to Shanghai via the United States and Japan and arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 26th. They took the Changxing Company's Empress of Asia at 2:30 PM on the next day (the 27th) and went to Hong Kong with British Ambassador Sir Kerr to take over the matter. When passing through Shanghai, he told people that the hearts of the people of the British Isles were very calm and very excited about the German offensive. When he left England five weeks ago, although the German air blitz had not yet begun, he dared to assert that there were no words such as "panic" and "discouragement" in the British dictionary, because the British people knew that the expansion of their national combat power allowed them in the Royal Air Force, mostly the fresh forces of the British dominions, so their bravery and courage were commendable, and aircraft production had reached the required amount due to day and night processing, and the air force advantage will undoubtedly be ours in the future. Therefore, I hope that the British expatriates in Shanghai should not worry about the situation in the British mainland, because the people of the British mainland have not worried about their encounters and are confident that they can defeat Hitler.

### Huge Amount of Foreign Rice Transported to Shanghai; Vietnam Situation Tense, Rice Weevils Thinking of Moving Again

Regarding the increasingly tense situation in Vietnam, the difficulty of shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam, and the many rumors in the market, general speculative merchants took the opportunity to become active, intending to raise the prices of long-stored goods for sale, in an attempt to obtain huge profits without labor. After the rice merchants' tea party market opened the day before yesterday, the people's hearts were temporarily strong, and speculative rice weevils were thinking of moving again. The market price was shouted up by more than one yuan, and the result was that the previous market was made seven or eight cents higher. However, the market prices of foreign rice in each grade have approached the highest assessed price. The authorities of the two concessions and the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee are paying close attention to the rumors currently spreading in the rice market, and it is learned that there is no danger of interruption in the source of foreign rice from abroad. If the shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam is stopped, rice from Siam can still be transported to the market. Moreover, when domestic early rice enters the market and the rice stacks are fully stocked, 3,000 tons (ie 300,000 bags) of rice that has been ordered and stored in Hong Kong has already been loaded on wheels and is on its way to Shanghai, and will arrive at the port within days to supply the market. Therefore, the recent upward trend in rice prices is truly beyond expectations.

### Hanner Ship Released, Arrived at Ao Jiang Kou; Not Freed of Restraints; Not Imported Yet

Although the shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang and Shanghai and Fujian is full of thorns, shipowners are still doing their best to dredge. According to a report by the Datong News Agency reporter, the German Far East Company's Hanner ship, after being monitored by Japanese warships in the sea off Haimen, reported to Shanghai by the shipowner yesterday morning that it had been released and has now sailed to Ao Jiang Kou, but has not been imported yet. Although the reason for not being able to import was not mentioned in the telegram, the public believes that it must not have been freed from the restraints of the Japanese warships. The Shanghai company is waiting for the news that the ship can be imported smoothly. It is unreasonable to add obstruction to Ao Jiang, which does not involve the scope of the blockade. As for the Songmen route, since Gao Deng's successful trial voyage, the Manili Maler wheel, which is represented by the Baochang Shipping Company, has been closed yesterday and will sail to Song Dou today. On the Shanghai-Minnan route, the Fuxing Company's Xin Anna wheel was also closed yesterday and will sail to Fuqing this morning.

### Thieves Rob Car on Huajin Lane

At 10:05 AM yesterday morning, the Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank at No. 313 Fuzhou Road dispatched two employees, Zhu Shou Kang and Ma Xing Yuan, to carry 10,000 legal currency, divided into two packages, one package of 6,000 yuan and one package of 4,000 yuan, both wrapped in newspapers, to the Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank on Jiangxi Road. When the car was turning north at the intersection of Hankou Road and Shanxi Road on Huajin Lane, two bandits suddenly rushed out from the side of the road, both holding wooden fake pistols, and blocked the way. Then they jumped into the car and forcibly robbed the two employees of the two packages of cash, and then ran away. Afterwards, the two employees and the driver pursued closely and shouted for help. At that time, the nearby police heard the alarm and rushed over. As a result, one bandit was arrested, and a portion of the stolen goods, totaling 4,000 yuan, was seized from him. The other bandit escaped and was arrested into the police station and interrogated severely. According to the confession, another bandit was subsequently caught and detained for investigation.

### Yuan Renjie's Foster Son; Woman Takes Child and Flees; Woman Demands Huge Sum; Yuan Reports Arrest to Police; Said That Child is Born to Yuan and Woman

Yuan Renjie, a local man living on Zhongshan Road in Zhabei, entrusted his six-year-old son Tianyun to Xu Zhang, a neighbor and fellow villager, for fostering during the Shanghai War, paying six yuan per month. In June of this year, Tianyun was taken back once. On the 5th of this month, Xu Zhang came to Yuan's place and took Tianyun away again. At 10:30 AM on the 26th, Zhang went to Yuan's house again and suddenly claimed that Tianyun had been raised by her for three years and that she should be given 500 yuan. They quarreled with each other and left. At 1:30 PM, she and her son Xu Genfa and another vagrant went to Yuan's house to demand money, making a lot of noise, saying that if they were not given money, they would harm Tianyun, and went away with a loud roar. Yuan Renjie reported the situation to the Putuo Road Police Station. After a Chinese and Western detective found that Zhang lived at No. 40 Yaojia Lane, Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, they rushed to cooperate with the "Police Station" under its jurisdiction to arrest her. Zhang had taken the Yuan child away by opportunity, and only her son Xu Genfa was taken back to the Police Station. Yesterday, he was sent to a special court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin applied for custody. Questioning the defendant's confession, Tianyun was born to Yuan Renjie and his mother. Judge Jiang instructed to send them back to custody and reschedule the review.

### Child Trafficking Organization; Gang Leader Arrested; Sent Personnel to Xiamen to Detain and Bring to Shanghai; Also Seized Sixteen Children

In recent years, the number of young boys and girls abducted in Shanghai is countless. The reason is that there is a large-scale secret child trafficking organization in Shanghai, which sells most of the abducted children to Xiamen. A few months ago, the Jiaxing Road Police Station cracked a part of this organization. Now, Xie Wanfang, the chief detective of the Public Concession Police Station, has arrested five key figures in the organization, Chen Zhang, Xia Zufu, Jiang Ruju, Xiang Zhaoliang, and Wang Tang, at the Zhisha Dannie steamer and other places, and seized six children, including Chen Longqing, Lin Jincai, Zhang Gensheng, Shen Runchun, Lu Genfa, and Juhong. Except for Chen and Lin, who have found their families, they have been sent to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Now, the police have found that Zhang Gensheng is the son of Zhang Li at No. 3, Lane 189, Liaoyang Road, Shen Runchun is the son of Shen Dong at No. 34 Qunxianli, Zhoujiazui Road, and Lu Genfa is the son of Lu Zhang in the bungalow of Shihuibang, Huinan Road. However, Juhong was abducted from the countryside of Changshu, so her family cannot be found. During the rescheduled hearing of this case, the police found that the headquarters of this trafficking organization was located in Xiamen, so they sent personnel to Xiamen to cooperate with the local government to arrest the gang leader Su Desan and his accomplices Chen Jiabai, Chen Lin, and Zeng Wang, and seized sixteen children. Except for Su and the other four criminals who were escorted to Shanghai at 11:00 PM the night before, the remaining sixteen children are still on their way to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, Xiao Xiefei, the judge of the Criminal Court of the Xiao Xiefei, presided over the trial. The police lawyer Ru Bao-yi stated that since major criminals have been successively arrested in this case, it is urgent to investigate them in order to wipe out this evil group that separates families. Therefore, he requested that the criminals be temporarily detained and the hearing rescheduled, and that the children whose families have been found should be returned to their families first, so that families can be reunited as soon as possible. After Judge Xiao briefly questioned the criminals, he ruled that they would be detained and rescheduled for further questioning. Chen Longqing and the other five children who have been claimed by their families were allowed to be returned to their families first.

### Selling People; Woman Zhou Fengying Detained; Two Girls Sent to Jiliang Institute

Zhou Fengying (44 years old), a Suzhou woman residing at No. 843 Tiantong Road, has recently been making a lot of profit by selling people. She has two adopted daughters, Zhao Fudi, 10 years old, and Jiang Fubao, 7 years old, both local. Zhao was abused and beaten by Zhou from time to time, with scars all over her body. Neighbors wrote a secret letter to the Huisi Police Station under its jurisdiction, and sent detectives to rush to the address at noon on the 27th, arresting Zhou and sending Zhao to Renji Hospital. The examination revealed severe injuries on her face, shoulders, back, arms, legs, buttocks, etc., and bite wounds, etc. She, Jiang, and Zhou's 20-year-old biological daughter, Lin, were taken to the Police Station together. Yesterday, he was sent to the Criminal Court No. 3 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and asked for an extension for a detailed investigation. Zhao then stated that she had been to the defendant's house for five years, and if she was a little careless in her work, she would be brutally beaten, etc. Jiang said that she went to the defendant's house when she was three years old, calling her mother, and she did not know anything else. Questioning Zhou, her confession was vague. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered them to be sent back to custody and rescheduled for further review. Zhao and Jiang were temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for foster care.

### Head Nurse Died Suddenly; Both Defendants Not Guilty

In the case of Li Yuying, a Pingtan woman and head nurse of the Chinese and Western Sanatorium at No. 536 Bushi Road, who died suddenly, the prosecutor sued Lu Zhenqing, the director of the hospital, and Lin Zhengliang, the doctor, for the crime of forging documents, because they issued a certificate of death from madness and did not report to the autopsy as required. The defendants respectively hired Ling Changyan, Shan Yu-hua, and Zhu Hongru as three lawyers to defend them. The case was tried by Judge Zhu Chuzhe of the Special Second Court, and the trial was concluded.

Yesterday's sentencing, "The Main Text," Lu Zhenqing and Lin Zhengliang were not guilty, and the reasons for the judgment were stated in court, slightly adjusted, forming the criminal elements of this case, requiring evidence related to other people's criminal cases, and making false acts. In this case, the defendant Lin Zhengliang issued a death certificate for the purchase of a grave, not as evidence for other people's criminal cases, so there was no criminal act. The judgment is as above.

After this case occurred, the bizarre and complicated plot attracted a lot of attention from the society, and after the two defendants were prosecuted, the right and wrong were of great importance. Fortunately, lawyers such as Ling Changyan cited legal principles and engaged in defense, so they could be declared innocent.

### Yesterday Morning, Two Kidnappings Occurred: One Involving an Iron Business Owner, the Other a Yarn Merchant

Upstairs at 59 Lane, Weihaiwei Road, Seymour Road, Yong Sheng Coal Company, was rented by Tang Jintai from Wuxi. Tang, along with his wife, Qin, and son, Yonggen, lived in the back building on the second floor. The front building was established as the Yuan Tai Iron Company, specializing in the sale of scrap iron and old copper for a living. Yesterday morning, around 8:10 AM, Tang had not yet gotten out of bed when suddenly four burly men, dressed in Pulis suits and Xiangyun gauze shirts and trousers, speaking in Shanghai accents, hired a car from the Yitai Motor Company, number 17701, and drove to the front of the Yong Sheng Coal Company. They stormed upstairs to Tang's bed, forcibly dragged him up, took out handcuffs, cuffed him, and dragged him into the car, speeding away. Afterwards, it was learned that one of the four men was from Ningbo, named Zhang Guifu, who was in the same business as Tang Jintai and had business dealings with him. Before leaving, he told Tang's wife not to panic and to go to the "Local Court" in Nanshi to settle the debt. Subsequently, Tang's wife told people that Zhang Guifu had mortgaged a large amount of iron material to Tang in Hongkou before the war, and the silver and goods had long been settled. This sudden kidnapping was clearly a deliberate attempt to extort money.

Wealthy Yarn Merchant Targeted by Bandits

Li, a wealthy cotton yarn merchant, residing at No. 23, Lane 1320, Yuyuan Road, West Shanghai, possessing abundant assets, was targeted by bandits. Yesterday morning, around 8:50 AM, as Li was stepping out of his residence to board his own car, four armed bandits, lying in ambush at the end of the lane, suddenly appeared, brandishing guns and threatening him. They forced him into the car and sped away, destination unknown.

### Social Miscellany

Cao Puyi, from Chongming, was arrested by the Xinzha police for opening a gambling den at No. 43, Lane 781, Xinzha Road. He was escorted to the Second Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court yesterday morning, where Judge Liu presided over the trial. Cao Puyi was sentenced to twelve years and six months in prison for drug use and trafficking, and the drugs were confiscated.

### Finance, The End of the Month is Approaching, Long Positions in Foreign Exchange Begin to Sell Off

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, HSBC listed price, was unchanged. The market for British and American exchange rates was flat and then weakened again. This was because of a lack of stimulating news, and operators were slow to move. Most were watching with their arms folded, and a few speculators went in and out suddenly. Also, because the end of the month is approaching, long positions began to spit out and roll over to the next month, so recently the US exchange rate once hardened to 5 yuan and a half can be settled, and the British exchange rate also saw a return from tight to flat. HSBC also had plenty of supply intentions at 5 yuan and a half for the US exchange rate, but after that, because HSBC stopped supplying, buyers wanted to buy, and 5 yuan 46875 also felt difficult. Until near noon, speculators came out again to go in, and the potential weakened again. The closing was little changed. As a result, British gold was three pence six two five, and the US exchange rate was 5 yuan four six eight seven five, which was flat with the British exchange rate of the previous day, and the US exchange rate was loose zero six two five. The futures were also the same.

In and Out Not Lively

At the beginning of the morning, the London big strips rose by 115, reaching a rise of zero six two five. New York silver prices remained flat, London gold remained fixed, and the exchange rate of British to American did not move. The exchange rate of British to Shanghai was also flat, the exchange rate of US to British was a small percentage, the exchange rate of US to Shanghai was smaller, and there was no market for French exchange rates. The central listing of each exchange rate remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was British gold three pence six zero nine three seven five, and the US exchange rate was 5 yuan four zero six two five, which was slightly tighter than the previous day's closing price zero one five six two five, and the US exchange rate was flat. After the opening, Chinese speculators had a slight appetite, and the market was stable. It is estimated that the Chartered Bank sold US exchange rates of 5 yuan four zero six two five for August to Chinese merchants, and 5 yuan three seven five for September. HSBC's listing was announced and did not move, and the silver balance tax was announced to increase by 1.00%. After that, although American banks and others absorbed it, a part of the speculators suddenly came to sell, and HSBC at that time was willing to supply US exchange rates of 5 yuan and a half. It is estimated that Chinese speculators issued US exchange rates of 5 yuan four three seven five to 5 yuan and a half for August by Standard Chartered and Japanese banks. But after a while, HSBC stopped, so the US exchange rate of 5 yuan four six eight seven five was also difficult to settle. Later, Chinese speculators regained US exchange rates for September, as 5 yuan four three seven five. The closing result was British gold three pence six two five, and the US exchange rate was 5 yuan four six eight seven five. The September British gold was two pence six zero nine two seven five, and the US exchange rate was 5 yuan four three seven five, which was no honor or disgrace compared to the British exchange rate. The US exchange rate increased by zero six two five each.

Hong Kong Exchange Market Still Flat

Hong Kong, 18th (Wednesday) Electric, the exchange market opened flat this morning. There was no change in British exchange spot futures and Shanghai exchange spot. The US exchange spot was loose zero six two five, at 22 yuan five six five. The Japanese exchange spot increased by half a yuan, at 96 yuan.

### The Environment is Not Purely Bullish, The Gold Market's Rise Has Ended

Although the enthusiasm for buying in the cash red black market yesterday was strong, the rising trend was still greatly hindered. Judging from the situation outside the market yesterday afternoon, the 5,900 yuan mark had already been exceeded. The market opened only at 5,880 yuan at the beginning of the morning, and because the exchange market reported hard, gold and silver companies and others sold out to the market. They still relied on the Hong Kong gang to secretly pull up, and a certain money exchange industry to cover shorts, to firmly guard above 5,850 yuan. But not long ago, the general bulls of the same day saw that the environment was not purely bullish, and their thoughts all turned, and those who tended to sell rose one after another. The securities gang bulls came out from time to time, and the silver companies also threw, and the lowest was 5,835 yuan. The noon closing was only 5,838 yuan, which was 8 yuan higher than the previous day. About 2,000 taels were traded in half a day, and the silver building ornaments did not change in the end. Customs gold, etc. remained flat.

Red Open is the Highest

Since the beginning of the morning, each tael (ten taels), the market was stable, first the money exchange industry entered 50 taels of gold number, at 5,880 yuan, which was 50 yuan better than the formal price before the holiday. Later, because the gold number gang tended to sell, although the Hong Kong gang was asking for absorption at this time, but because the exchange rate reported loose, floating more often closed, so the head felt that the supply was greater than the demand. Not long after, it tragically fell by 60 yuan. Silver companies entered 20 taels in the silver building industry, and the price dropped to 5,820 yuan. Then the selling wind subsided slightly, and a certain money exchange industry took advantage of the low to cover shorts, and the Hong Kong gang continued to secretly search for purchases, so it soon rose again to 5,875 yuan. Finally, another money exchange industry suddenly came to spit out, and the securities gang bulls frequently came out, and it dropped another 35 yuan. The silver numbers mutually did 20 taels, and it retreated to 5,840 yuan. Later, it relied on the gold number to pull up slightly, and it rose more than 10 yuan again. But not long after, the selling wind rose again, and the silver number gang stuffed out even more. But a certain money exchange industry still made small covers, and it fell to 5,835 yuan before the closing. However, the closing reported 5,838 yuan, which was 8 yuan higher than the noon closing on Monday of this week. The six-month yuan fluctuated, and the selling price of cash number's own brand gold was more than ten yuan higher than the red open, and the purchase was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is little activity.

Jewelry Gold Still Hangs at 600 Yuan

The exchange of gold jewelry from silver buildings per tael has not changed. Datonghang still hangs at 600 yuan, and the new exchange is similar to the above price, reducing the purchase by about 30 yuan.

### Last Day for Using British Pound Notes in Shanghai

The British gold pound notes circulating in Shanghai can be largely divided into 10-pound, 5-pound, 1-pound, and 10-shilling (half-pound) notes. Banks and money shops refer to the 5-pound and 10-pound notes as large notes and the 1-pound and half-pound notes as small notes. The buying and selling prices vary. The prices published in the newspapers are for large notes. Small notes are worth half a yuan or one yuan less, and half-pound notes are even lower. British banks and the Bank of China do not differentiate. Therefore, those who want to sell their British pound notes should first inquire at British banks, such as HSBC and Mercantile Bank. After inquiring about the prices, they can then inquire at the small money shops on Sichuan Road and sell to whichever offers the highest price. However, it is important to distinguish between large and small notes. As far as I know, large notes can be sold to money shops, while small notes can only be sold to British banks. If note holders possess a large number of gold pound notes, they can have the British bank send them to London to be exchanged for British drafts at the Bank of England, which can then be remitted to Shanghai. The commission fee is 0.25%, plus insurance and the cost of remitting from England to Shanghai, which is more cost-effective than selling to various places. However, it takes two months to receive the money. Furthermore, those who do not have commercial relations with the bank cannot ask them to collect the money. (Bing)

### Gradual Increase in Japanese Currency

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the apparent rise of Russian currency, although it was still lower than the over-the-counter price on the 26th. Consequently, British and American pounds also fell by five jiao each. There were still a few transactions involving British gold notes, and the market price rebounded by five jiao. American gold notes gradually declined, falling to 18.12 yuan in the evening market, a drop of 0.23 yuan compared to the pre-holiday (26th) price. Hong Kong notes were in high demand, and the market price soared. Annam, Robi, Philippine, and Australian gold notes were also in demand, and their market prices uniformly rose. The upward trend of Japanese gold notes did not subside, rising to 1.475 yuan in the evening market. The supply and demand for Korean notes remained balanced, and the evening market price remained at the original price of 1.085 yuan.

### Method for Distinguishing Woolen Cloth and Serge

— Zhifeng

The value of woolen cloth and serge naturally depends on its weight, with heavier being more valuable and lighter being cheaper. Smooth and firm fabric made from well-spun wool is considered superior, while coarse and loose fabric made from raw wool is inferior. Overcoating wool is the opposite; lighter is superior and heavier is inferior. This is because overcoating wool becomes thicker, with more yarn making it heavy and stiff, while more wool makes it light and soft. For thin woolen cloth and serge, it is generally known that full wool fabric has no wrinkles after being tightly grasped and crumpled. Fabric with more wool and less yarn will also have fewer wrinkles. Fabric with less wool and more yarn will have heavy wrinkles. To determine the composition of yarn and wool, two threads should be pulled out horizontally and vertically and burned separately with a match. Wool has a foul odor, and the ashes shrink into a spherical shape. Yarn crackles, has no odor, and no shape. This is conclusive evidence. However, it is important to note that tweed often contains mixed colors, with one thread of wool and one thread of cotton yarn spun together. Therefore, when burning, it is necessary to first separate them by rubbing them between the thumb and forefinger before burning. Most woolen fabrics are woven in a "well" shape, with ordinary fabrics having ten threads of yarn and ten threads of wool, while better fabrics have ten threads of yarn and twenty threads of wool. Salesmen often pull out woolen threads and burn them for customers to see, but they do not pull out the yarn threads. Clever customers should carefully distinguish them to avoid being deceived. After the "August 13th" incident, most of the domestic woolen fabrics were mixed with rayon. Rayon is light, soft, and fluffy, appearing similar to wool at first glance. It is easy to be fooled if one relies solely on hand-feeling without burning.

To distinguish the front and back sides of fabrics such as serge, broadcloth, riding breeches cloth, and straight gabardine is easy because they all have diagonal patterns. Those who wear woolen serge clothing know that the left-sloping side is the front. For other types of patterned tweed, if there are diagonal patterns, the left-sloping side is also considered the front. Just remember the character "人" (person); one stroke being "丿" (left-falling stroke) is the correct side, and one stroke being "　" (right-falling stroke) is the reverse side. There is also an excellent method for distinguishing, regardless of the thickness of the fabric and regardless of day or night. Hold the fabric in your hand and bring it close to your eyes, about five or six inches away. Look carefully; the shiny side is the front, and the furry side is the back. If both sides of fabrics such as board cloth, hairline, and fulham have fur, then the fur on the front side will be short and stiff, while the fur on the reverse side will be long and flat without a doubt.

### Discount Rate Rises by One Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts rose slightly, with the buying discount consistently at 37 yuan per thousand throughout the day and the selling discount at 39 yuan, an increase of one yuan. The interest rate for interbank lending remained unchanged, quoted at 0.16 yuan for both the morning and afternoon sessions.

### Securities and Bond Market Thriving

After the holiday, the securities market suddenly turned bullish. The market was stable in the morning and extremely active in the afternoon, with prices climbing steadily without looking back, almost reaching the high prices of the 12th. Rumor has it that Hong Kong investors have a large demand, and the atmosphere has improved. The market is showing signs of prosperity again. In recent months, the market has seen a clear trend: whenever prices weaken, trading slows down; when prices rise, trading increases. This phenomenon suggests that there are often large investors buying in, while smaller investors are mostly selling. This is undeniable. Currently, without even considering the gradual improvement of the environment, judging from the market situation, the scarcity of chips and the excitement of investors suggest a promising future. Trading was very limited in the morning, with a turnover of only about 100,000 yuan. However, the underlying market trend was already improving. Lianyi and Tongxing were buying, while Yitai, Renchang, and Yichang were selling. In the afternoon, Lianyi and Xinfu continued to buy aggressively, making it very lively. No. 16 and Tiansheng Hengfu also showed strong interest. Although Tongkang, Hongkang, Lianhe, and other bulls were taking profits or selling, prices continued to rise gradually. Later, Dafeng and Shunchang sold, while Hongda, Dasheng, and Daxinchang again showed demand, and prices remained firm. As a result, prices uniformly rebounded by 0.45 yuan to 0.85 yuan, with a total turnover estimated at 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. The details are listed below.

Stock transactions: 45 shares of Zhonghua Book Company were traded at a price of 30.05 yuan per share.

According to a report from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the stock market opened with an uncertain trend yesterday, but gradually became firmer later in the day. The volatility on the day was significantly less than in the previous days, and trading was extremely active. At the close, buyers had an absolute advantage in both industrial and rubber stocks.

London, 27th (Tuesday): The market prices of Chinese foreign bonds and Far Eastern British company stocks today saw a slight improvement in British stocks. HSBC's London-registered shares rose by half a pound to 62.5 pounds. Hong Kong-registered shares remained unchanged. Gula-Klang rubber shares rose by three pence to 14 shillings, while the rest remained unchanged.

### Grain: Rice Difficult to Manipulate, Price Increase Fleeting

Yesterday, the opening of the foreign rice market was still tight, with sellers unwilling to easily let go. Buyers, in addition to local shops continuing to purchase, also saw some activity from inland traders. In addition, speculators and small-scale hoarders were eager to trade, causing a surge. Both Saigon fired rice and twisted rice exceeded the quoted price by more than one yuan. However, with ample warehouse stocks, there was some concern that excessive manipulation would be difficult to manage. As a result, the market trend turned weak, with more selling than buying, and prices fell back. The closing prices returned to the original levels. No. 1 aged Saigon rice remained at 59.5 yuan, No. 2 at 56.2 yuan and 56 yuan, fired rice at 59.2 yuan and 59 yuan, small twisted pointed rice at 54.6 yuan and 54 yuan. Other varieties also followed suit. After all, due to the lack of support from actual sales, even the original packaged Yinghua Company No. 2 Saigon rice was once quoted at 63.5 yuan, and No. 2 was quoted at 65 yuan for transferred cargo, but no transactions were made due to the wait-and-see attitude of buyers. The trading volume of spot rice was only about 4,000 bags.

Yesterday, there was also a small shipment of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai, 606 bags of which were loaded from Hong Kong on the Taikoo Company's Jinan Wheel and arrived at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession in the morning. (Zu)

Although the arrival of japonica and glutinous domestic rice was limited, it was rumored that the market inside and outside was similar to the supply and demand due to the price being expensive. Open Jinli special yuan remained at 62-63 yuan, Changdan white yuan around 61 yuan, Hong Kong special wu at 62.5 yuan and 62 yuan, Changbang fresh clear japonica at 68.5 yuan and 68 yuan, Changzhou Sukun japonica around 66 yuan, and secondary to 63 yuan, Nangang original packaged early rice at 64 yuan, the market saw 62.5 yuan, finally 61.5 yuan, etc.

The source of Zhoupu new japonica rice continued to be cut off, with only 6 dan reported to have been made, and the price remained at 63 yuan.

### Japanese Flour Spot Prices Fall, Futures Rise

The flour market yesterday was quite ordinary for spot goods. Because foreign wheat and foreign flour have arrived in recent days, and the actual sales during this year's Mid-Autumn Festival mooncake season are far from comparable to the past, although the production of Chinese flour mills is limited, the sales volume is not very large. The total market turnover for Fuxin and Lao Che Pai flour was nearly 4,000 bags, and the mill price was still 15 yuan. As for the Japanese flour market, the spot price fell while the futures price rose. Phoenix brand spot goods were 14.55 yuan, a slight drop of 0.05 yuan, September was 14.8 yuan, and October required 15 yuan, with over 3,000 bags traded. Other inland flours and foreign flours, although they have arrived, have not opened for sale.

The wheat market yesterday was also lackluster. It was found that several thousand bags arrive at Hongkou and Zhabei every day, but they are all limited to delivery to Japanese mills, and the supply to Chinese mills remains difficult. Therefore, the purchase price of Chinese mills is still about 2 yuan higher than that of Japanese mills, and the total quantity is less than 1,000 bags. Japanese mills had good purchase volume, with about 3,000 bags delivered to the mills, and the price remained around 21 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton: Large Investors Take Profits, Cotton Yarn Plummets After Rising, Closing at a Low of 963 Yuan

The yarn market, which was surging the day before yesterday, turned downward after opening higher yesterday. This was entirely due to the actions of speculators. After rising for several days, it had increased by more than 100 yuan compared to the low price. Given that the current environment is not very favorable, it is better to secure profits than to keep them in hand. Therefore, many bulls came out, and the market quickly declined. However, some investors were still optimistic, but inventories were increasing daily.

Spot yarn opened in the morning, continuing the enthusiasm from the previous day, and the bulls took the opportunity to raise prices, resulting in a sharp upward trend. 20-count Double Horse yarn opened at 990 yuan. However, some large investors were secretly selling, and the momentum was softening. It slightly fell to 985 yuan, but general speculators were still buying, and the bulls were still strong. Unexpectedly, profit-takers unanimously sold out, and the market fluctuated for a long time. As the chips loosened, the downward trend accelerated around 11 o'clock, breaking through several levels, from 980 yuan to 970 yuan, closing at a low price of 963 yuan. It was found that 2,345 bales were traded in half a day. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 20 yuan. Today, 1,357 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each port is as follows: same industry 1,400, Hong Kong 925, total 2,345.

### New Cotton Condition Very Good, 4,800 Bales of Indian Cotton Arrive

The current cotton situation has become quiet again. Except for occasional demand from Japanese factories, the payment period is still one or two months later. At the same time, the upward trend in yarn prices is like a flash in the pan, fleeting. Therefore, the cotton market sentiment has been hit again. In addition, the condition of new cotton production is currently not bad. If there are no storms during the White Dew season, a good harvest can be expected. Therefore, the cotton market is expecting stable prices. There were very few transactions for spot cotton today, and the market trend was weak.

Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was very quiet, and as a result of mass selling and some bulls closing out, the closing prices fell by three to five pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by 2.5 robies.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading: Yesterday, due to the improvement in yarn prices, raw cotton trading became active again, but the volume was not large. Japanese manufacturers were more active in purchasing, while Chinese factories were quieter, because Chinese factories generally have more inventory than Japanese factories.

4,800 bales of Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai the night before last, shipped from Bombay on the British Company's Soudan Wheel. They arrived at the port at 8 pm the night before last (27th) and berthed at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou for unloading.

### Piece Goods: Speculators Sell Off, Stock Prices Fall

Domestic Cloth: As rumors gradually subsided, foreign exchange rates lengthened, and the Shanghai-Hankou Line's Hana Wheel was again hindered, the market atmosphere relaxed, and speculators continued to sell. However, the Guangdong and Hong Kong traders' appetite remained strong. The opening prices for various cloths were flat, and a part of the prices fell in the later market, 0.25 yuan to 0.5 yuan per piece. Traders from Guangdong and Hong Kong bought more than 200 pieces of coarse cloth and grey cloth, and nearly 300 pieces of coarse cloth, twill cloth and colored cloth. Traders from Zhejiang and Fujian bought nearly 100 pieces of colored cloth and coarse cloth. Traders from Yantai bought more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth and gabardine. Traders from Henan bought more than 3,000 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill.

Eastern Cloth: Due to sluggish actual sales and a decrease in the benchmark price, general speculators with long positions sold off slightly at a profit, and the market trend turned downward. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 33.05 yuan in the morning, and fell by 1 yuan per piece to 32 yuan in the afternoon, and continued to fall by 0.25 yuan to 31.75 yuan at the closing. Four Gentlemen gabardine also fell by 0.02 yuan to 0.925 yuan per yard.

Exports: 407 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong today.

### Oil Market: Edible Oil Trading Very Active, Price Up Another 2.5 Yuan

Yesterday, trading in the oil market was very active. As production prices recovered, investors' confidence rose, and both raw soybean oil and processed soybean oil advanced, resulting in a sharp increase of 2.5-2.6 yuan compared to before the holiday. The leading trading category was futures. In addition to the local street, garden, and inland markets accounting for one-third of the spot market sales, the rest were speculative. A total of 80 pieces of Jiaozhou raw crude oil were traded at 64-65 yuan, and 100 pieces to be delivered in the first half of September were priced at 63.5 yuan. 350 pieces from the second half of September to the second half of October were priced at 62 yuan. 200 pieces of Yantai tallow to be delivered in September were priced at 64 yuan. 50 barrels of Qingdao raw crude oil were priced at 90-91 yuan. 1,000 barrels of land cargo were priced at 88.5 yuan to 90 yuan. The traded soybean oil included 50 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, with prices detailed in the market price section; 50 pieces of Qingqi oil, 50 pieces of Yanqi oil, 20 barrels of Jiangbei oil, 100 barrels of Dalian oil, 30 barrels of Rihua factory oil, and 200 dan of Dayou factory oil.

Yesterday, 1,100 cans of tung oil arrived from Tianjin.

### Sugar Market: Raw White Turns Expensive

Yesterday's sugar market guild settlement prices: 24 raw white spot was 76.3 yuan, old goods was 75 yuan. Suddenly, a telegram came from the Netherlands, 3.19 US dollars C.I.F.I.C. example, so people's hearts easily rose by several jiao. New goods were 76.7 yuan to 77 yuan, up 0.5 yuan from the previous day. Old goods were 75.9 yuan, transit goods, that is, those with delivery orders, were 60.09 yuan and 61.2 yuan, up 0.7 yuan. Those to be delivered on September 6 were 61.5 yuan to 62 yuan, up 0.5 yuan. Gu B mark was 75 yuan and 75.5 yuan, down 0.05 yuan.

Those with September 6 delivery orders were 62.5 yuan. Also, yesterday 5,320 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong.

### Hardware: Single-Coated Iron Has Active Sales

The trading of 90-pound single-coated tinplate circulating on the market was quite exciting yesterday. Because a certain agency made some purchases, and the small hardware stores on this street also participated in large numbers, although manufacturers did not search much, the market was quite lively, so the industry's thoughts recovered, and the market price became firm and expensive. Prices of 120 yuan and 125 yuan per box were quoted.

### Zhabei Goods: Large-Sized Dried Longans – Supply Short, Prices Soar

Due to the lack of incoming shipments of large-sized dried longans and the scarcity in the market, coupled with the time needed for new shipments, there is a concern of supply disruption. Recently, the market price has surged by forty yuan. Medium-sized longans have also seen a price increase of ten yuan, while small-sized longans remain relatively stable.

Old News Re-copied: 67 Years Ago (490) (See this Newspaper from the 12th Year of Tongzhi, Qing Dynasty)

### Deception

I once discussed with someone the tricks of petty people. The two words "deception" can be used anywhere, and it doesn't necessarily matter whether the matter is big or small. In the past, a Banner Man guarded a waterfront town in a certain prefecture. Fish and turtles were not worth much money. A certain gentleman invited the prefect to a banquet, and there was a dish of drunken fresh shrimp, which was delicious. Upon returning, he ordered the cook to prepare it in the same way, and from then on, it was served every day. One day, he said to the gentleman, "You said it wouldn't cost much money, but why does the cook spend 200 cash every day?" The gentleman smiled without answering. Several years ago, someone went to Qingxing Restaurant, which serves northern cuisine. One day, a guest from Beijing ordered sweet and sour radish salad and said to the owner, "This is a southern dish that I have always loved in Beijing. It is especially refreshing and delicious!" The owner thought it was fashionable and imitated it. Every time he went to this restaurant, he would order this dish, and the cost to the restaurant was only one coin and two cents, or eighty-four large coins. The diner didn't think it was expensive, which shows the tricks of the market people. There are northerners who cook southern dishes, which means selling southern goods at northern prices. Often, noble young masters inherit the privilege of their grandfathers and spend half their lives as playboys. When they enter society, everyone regards them as rare commodities, flattering and pleasing them in every way, which means calculating them in every way. What others get for one coin, they must pay ten coins for. These kinds of deceptive practices are laughable to talk about, but if they are considered trivial matters, then everything in the world will involve the two words "deception." It's not just petty people who do this; even those who call themselves great men do the same. It's not just food; important national items, rare and exotic needs, and matters of great importance are all subject to this.

Family

### Wife

— Wu Jianfen

Washington Irving, in a short story titled "Wife," describes a woman who tries her best to comfort her husband, who is despondent after failing in speculative ventures, "using all her vivacity and gentle charm to win back his happiness!" This makes the man feel grateful and tearful, saying that he has never experienced such wonderful happiness in his life. Irving believes that nothing is more moving than this and concludes:

"A married man who encounters setbacks is more likely to regain his position in the world than a bachelor. Partly because his beloved needs to live with him, which encourages him to work hard, but mainly because his spirit has the warmth and comfort of a family, and his self-esteem is also active, feeling that although the outside world is dark and submissive, there is still a small world of love within the family… On the other hand, bachelors are most prone to self-abandonment, always seeking solitude and indulgence, and their hearts easily become ruins, like a desolate house, simply because it lacks a resident."

This judgment is correct. Historically, many heroes and warriors, when they were down on their luck and on the verge of despair, relied on the power of the opposite sex to revive them. Women are like flexible fingers, but they are also tempered steel. Thanks to their support, they often shape men's strong character and indomitable spirit. Look at how people are generally unremarkable in their youth before marriage, but as they enter middle age and old age, their careers shine brightly. Shouldn't this also be attributed to the encouragement of love from the opposite sex? I can't help but think of Gorky's words: "If there is no love, why do you want to live in the world!"

The poet Milton once sang, "The fragrant scent emitted by marriage is sweeter than a violet bed." A wife who provides support and comfort is precious, and those who have wives are truly happy. Five or six years ago, when I read Gorky's "Reminiscences of Andreyev," I felt this way, and I still secretly envied this melancholic writer for having such a wife: she could be a passionate lover, and she could also treat Andreyev with maternal love and care. Moreover, she deeply understood the meaning of his talent and the painful fluctuations in his mood. She "constantly used all her strength, sacrificing her entire personality for her husband." To young, unmarried people, this might seem like a "standard wife"! However, while "secretly envying," I can't help but feel sorry for this "Lady Xira": why should a woman sacrifice even her own personality for her husband? I thought.

In the play "Annoying Society" by French writer Édouard Pailleron, Paul Laimond, who uses "salon" as a "stepping stone," says to his wife Xiahen, "When I came in, I was a county magistrate, but when I leave, I should be a prefect. Everything depends on you." It is said that in French society, a man is often judged by his wife, so whether Paul can be promoted depends entirely on his wife. However, Chinese society is different. A wife takes pride in her husband's glory and shame in his humiliation. Women have been serving men by sacrificing their entire personalities for ages. This is a great disgrace for women! It is certainly necessary for women to share hardships and joys with men, understand each other, and encourage each other. But if it goes so far as to sacrifice the entire personality, the result is equivalent to a docile sheep that obeys everything. Generation after generation, women can only and will always be appendages of men; strictly speaking, they are slaves of men. Just as the famous Soviet poet Nekrasov roared for the lowly rural women of the Tsarist era:

"Entering the coffin at death, still a slave!"

Hawthorne's Case

### The Homecoming of a Dancing Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Six: A Dangerous Experience

Ni Jinshou's astonishing reply only earned him a cold laugh from the young man. He stared at Ni Jinshou again, then fell silent once more. Ni Jinshou, on the other hand, felt somewhat embarrassed, as this cold laugh was indeed unexpected to me as well. Ni Jinshou lowered his head for a moment, then suddenly pulled out his notebook from his pocket.

While flipping through the notebook, he said, "Do you think I'm falsely accusing you without proof? Listen, let me give you a few pieces of evidence: Your relationship with Wang Lilan has been going on for quite some time, often taking advantage of Lu Jiansheng's absence to spend the night at her place—her place is at 27 Qingpu Road."

Ni Jinshou's gaze shifted from his notebook to Yu Ertang's face, but Yu Ertang no longer had the courage to meet his eyes, instead looking down at the tips of his own leather shoes. At this moment, I also noticed his shoes. The shoes were made of yellow textured leather with pointed toes, which seemed different from the two male leather shoe prints I had just traced in the corpse house. Although the two prints were of different sizes, they were both round.

Ni Jinshou continued looking at the notebook and said, "Recently, Wang Lilan has had a new lover, Zhao Boxiong. It's not surprising for such a romantic woman to abandon the old for the new. But you took it seriously and started to hate her. On the eleventh, you and this Zhao Boxiong met, and you clashed. At that time, Wang Lilan defended her new love, openly rejecting you. This made you hate her even more, leading to the intention to murder. This is your motive for killing."

The young man was no longer as quiet as before. Although he was still silently lowering his head, I could see that there was no color in his cheeks.

Ni Jinshou added, "Is this a false accusation? ... Alright, listen again: On the evening of the sixteenth, you went to her house and secretly inquired about her and Zhao Boxiong's movements from the old servant. On the night of the seventeenth, you went to room 774 on the seventh floor of the Yadong Hotel to investigate, and learned that Wang Lilan had spent the previous night there—this room 774 was Zhao Boxiong's residence."

Yu Ertang's expression became even more uneasy. He was biting his lip, and his head seemed so heavy that he could no longer hold it up. This expression gave Ni Jinshou a sense of excitement, and he continued to declare the young man's crimes.

### Tiger

— Xiu Bi

I dreamed that I was in a forest, holding a sword, like a warrior.

A fierce tiger stood in front of me, roaring.

I angrily raised my sword, shouting:

"I will slay you, you cruel beast, you evil devil!"

"Haha! Cruel," the tiger roared in reply: "I am not as cruel as humans."

"Nonsense!" I swung my sword.

"I kill the weak only for hunger, but not to establish my own reputation. I do not use words to decorate this hypocritical crime, nor do I want others to praise my slaughter."

"Nonsense." My voice was much weaker than before.

"Moreover, I kill the weak only with my teeth and claws, but not with iron and gunpowder, fire and machines. I kill the weak only with my own physical strength, but not with any trickery or conspiracy... Furthermore, my roar only kills one life, but what about you humans? Some people, with one roar, kill..."

Without hearing the end of its words, I finally lowered my sword and bowed my head.

"Humans! What can you say?" the fierce tiger said, laughing.

I could not say anything, and I remained silent until I woke up from the dream.

### Reflections by the Window

— Ming Mang

The clear blue, seemingly bottomless sky, peers in through the window. This sky, filled with the glory of the setting sun, pulsating with brilliant music, makes me sink into longing reflections, even though it is just a square.

However, standing by the window, I gaze at it yearningly. Suddenly, I feel that this square of blue sky is gradually expanding; expanding in all directions. It is like a vast ocean, boundless and profound. And directly beneath this blue sea is the lovely golden field. The summer sun shines down, sparkling and dancing. The waves of wheat roll forward, crossing this boundless expanse; this is the bountiful land of the motherland.

The mountains and forests, deep and dark, tall and lush. The mountain ridges, countless peaks rising, firm and sturdy. Is this a surge of life's brute force from the earth? One peak after another, horizontally arranged, the deep blue sky is extraordinarily vivid and vibrant.

I think, I think silently, I know from letters from friends about the exciting news from the motherland's fields. I am immersed in fantasy, I fantasize about those exciting lives and news! Those admirable friends' strong will and faith.

"The importance of freedom far outweighs our lives!"

My friend's letter says so. Facing this square of blue sky outside the window, I repeat and silently read it, thinking about what this sentence means to them.

But in this narrow cage, I only intensify my longing, my memories, for that ocean-like blue sky, the boundless fields, and the surging dark mountains and forests, and those exciting companions and exciting days...

I long for a land of freedom, and I cannot suppress it.

Medicine

### Headache and Intelligence

— Hua Zhi

Intellectuals often suffer from periodic headaches or asthma, usually regarded as a symbol of ill health. However, according to the latest medical theories, these two symptoms are considered signs of intelligence, purely physiological, and medicine is ineffective.

This is based on a recent presentation by Professor Bayer of Oklahoma City University to the Mexican Medical Association. He said: "Some people's headaches are actually a slight indication of excessive super-intelligence, because they have very complex nervous systems. The extreme development of these nervous systems can stimulate the psychological aspects, thus turning into migraines and asthma."

"As for whether women suffering from this symptom should also be regarded as intelligent, this question is worth studying. However, some women are indeed more alert than men, which may be the result of advanced intelligence development."

"In short, people with dynamism, whether male or female, are prone to headaches and asthma. There are few medical treatments for this; if any, it is only rest."

### Bleeding

— Liu Jiagan

When it is necessary to bleed, do not fear bleeding.

When there is no need to bleed, strive to avoid bleeding.

Bleeding should have a price, because there is nothing more precious than blood in the body.

Remember: blood is red, it should not be "shed in vain!"

Entertainment Scene

### Cao Yu on the Future of Chinese Spoken Drama

— Rong Shang

Since "Zheng Zai Xiang" ("Thinking") was performed in Shanghai, public opinion has been full of praise. Cao Yu's reputation and status in the theater world have undoubtedly been increasing day by day. I remember that in the twenty-sixth year (1937), he gave a public lecture at the Literary Research Association of Central University on the topic "The Path Chinese Spoken Drama Should Take," and there were many insightful views at the time. Here, I have excerpted some important paragraphs from it, so that we have the opportunity to revisit the proverbs of this progressive playwright. It should be of some help to the vibrant Shanghai spoken drama scene today!

"From all aspects, the progress of Chinese spoken drama is indeed very satisfactory, but it still cannot be considered perfect. The current achievements are far from the ideal goal!"

"First: Although Chinese spoken drama is gradually approaching reality, it is not profound. It is only a superficial approach, not a real one. It can bring some social problems to the stage, but it does not connect the entire real social life."

"Second: Chinese spoken drama cannot be universal. Spoken drama is not entertainment. May I ask how many people can afford to spend 1.6 yuan to go to the theater in this day and age? Most of the people who really want to see plays have no way to enter the theater. If this continues, the Chinese spoken drama movement is very dangerous. Failure to universalize is failure to popularize."

"Third: Chinese spoken drama is not yet truly Chinese. To use flowers as an analogy, all literature and art are like flowers. Flowers cannot grow without soil. Chinese flowers should have Chinese soil. However, most Chinese spoken dramas do not have Chinese soil. Specifically, Chinese spoken drama is too abstract and conceptualized and cannot be linked to China's current real environment and real life."

"Fourth: It is a matter of skill. Chinese spoken drama has not yet completely learned Western techniques and applied them. No matter what, if you learn something that doesn't look like it, it's like eating something without digesting it."

"Although some people have noticed these points, they often make the mistake of being formulaic and idealistic. They only know how to touch people with preaching words, but they do not know how to touch people with emotions. The result only gives people a formula. This point must be improved. As for universalization, it is even more difficult to achieve. True art must be integrated with real society. Past spoken dramas could only express a part of social life. If the entire modern Chinese society is integrated into spoken drama, then its content will naturally be more substantial."

### Ten Ways of Kissing

— Luo Cun

The films produced by Hollywood companies, whether comedies, tragedies, court dramas, martial arts films, erotic films, literary films, or supernatural films, all have kissing scenes. This is something movie fans have seen. However, there are different ways of kissing. According to a Hollywood film critic, there are no more than the following ten ways:

(1) Sweet Kiss: When the distance between the two parties is more than two feet, and they lean forward to kiss each other, it is called a sweet kiss.

(2) Passionate Kiss: A passionate kiss is when two people hug each other tightly and kiss.

(3) Lingering Kiss: A kiss that is repeated more than twice in a row is called a lingering kiss.

(4) Cheek Kiss: When party A kisses the cheek of party B, it is called a cheek kiss. (This kiss also exists in our country, which is called kissing the face.)

(5) Loud Kiss: A kiss that is short and quick, while absorbing outside air, and making a sound when kissing, is called a loud kiss.

(6) Touching Kiss: A kiss that is still possible when there is an object between the two parties is called a touching kiss. (This type of kiss is most often used in prison scenes.)

(7) Shy Kiss: A shy kiss is when someone wants to kiss but doesn't, hesitates, and then kisses after all.

(8) Pouting Lips: When party A is willing to be kissed by party B, they first purse their lips to indicate they are waiting to be kissed.

(9) Back-of-the-Ear Kiss: When two people hug each other, they kiss each other's necks, called a back-of-the-ear kiss.

(10) Tip-of-the-Nose Kiss: Touching each other with the tips of their noses is called a tip-of-the-nose kiss, which in our country is also called measuring noses.

### Tidbits of the Chrysanthemum Stage

— Shan

(1)

Mei WanHua's most popular period was in the old capital Tian Le Yuan in the years of the Republic of China twenty-two and twenty-three (1933-1934), when ticket prices rose from 19 copper coins to 22 coins, and even to 36 coins. Before long, he was invited to Shanghai. After returning north, he played the first day of Fen He Wan at the Wenming Tea Garden, listed in a major role. It was February 7th, four years of the Republic of China (1915). Mr. Mei picked up the main role starting this day.

(2)

When Zhu QinXin was at her peak, her name could be compared with the Four Great Dan Actresses. In recent years, due to environmental reasons, she has gradually declined. Her face is too thin. When singing, she uses two sponges in her mouth to make her face look plumper. It seems very strenuous, but QinXin doesn't care.

(3)

Jin ShaoShan liked to spend money extravagantly. He had a great addiction to sex, singing, dogs, and horses. A few years ago, in Shanghai, he spent more than 500 yuan to buy a golden-eyed green-haired tortoise. He raised it in a specially made glass bowl and specially prepared more than 100 tables of lavish banquets to hold a tortoise celebration party. Those who received the invitation were all baffled.

(4)

Although Hou YuLan's clothing is very simple, her powder box is extremely exquisite. The box is in the shape of a square antique with the three characters "Hou YuLan" engraved on it. Two small light bulbs are installed on both sides of the mirror, which is beautiful!

Some people say: Listening to the Tan School opera is like drinking a glass of milk. Jiao Tian is a glass of pure milk, which tastes sweet and fresh. Shu Yan has diluted it with half a glass of boiled water. Although it still looks like milk, the taste is half lighter. Fu Ying is one-third milk, mixed with two-thirds boiled water, and added some white sugar. The sweet ingredient is sugar rather than milk. Ma LianLiang is completely a glass of condensed milk, with a lot of white sugar added, which is terribly sweet.

(6)

Xiao ChangHua's words always stick to his profession. He repaired Xu BaoFang's tomb the year before last, Yang XiaoLou died, and he mediated the disputes after his death. This old man was very busy. When asked, he said: "I'm just busy for the 'Xu Yang Two Families.' "Xu Yang Two Families" are the lyrics of the Two into the Palace opera.

### Chen JuanJuan's Lofty Aspirations

— Han Mei

Chen JuanJuan's entry into the film industry was first discovered by Lianhua Film Company. Films such as Little Orphan Girl and The Prodigal Lamb were greatly praised by movie fans. After August 13th (1937), Chen sister went abroad to perform in Singapore and raise donations for national salvation from overseas Chinese, giving great excitement to overseas Chinese.

Last winter, Chen JuanJuan returned from her travels abroad. The little angel of the Chinese film industry was recruited by Zhang Shankun, a giant of Chinese film, and signed a one-year contract with Guolian Film Company. JuanJuan's intention was that the monthly salary was not important, as long as she could support her family. Her ambition was to display her art on the silver screen.

After JuanJuan returned to Shanghai, her life has been stabilized by Guolian. In addition to filming, she is now hiring teachers to teach her Chinese, English, drawing, and music, striving in academics, and her aspirations are quite lofty. As for film production, in addition to co-starring with Chen YanYan in "Du Shiniang," Guolian has prepared and planned a new film "Snow White" for her, with the intention of making JuanJuan conform to her personality and give full play to her genius. Chen Shu lost her father early and was raised by her grandmother. Feeling adrift, she excels in tragic plays. If she is self-motivated, it will not be difficult for her to stand out. The picture on the right is a recent photo of JuanJuan, innocent and lively, which can be seen from a glimpse.

### Hu Wenhu Invests, A Pioneer in the Film Industry

— Hai Xing

"Star Alliance" Expresses a Solemn Stance

The productions of the three government-run companies in Chongqing, "China," "China Electric," and the Northwest Film Studio of Shaanxi, have established the China Film Joint Company two months ago in order to unify the distribution routes. Luo Mingyou, the founder of the former Lianhua, was appointed as the manager to handle overseas distribution matters. Singaporian tycoon Hu Changyao and others are now organizing the Star Alliance Film Company, publicly declaring that they will be enemies with boring films. The company has the full support of Hu Wenhu, and the Sing Tao Daily and other media are its propaganda organs, so its momentum is huge. The productions of "China," "China Electric," and "Northwest" factories have all been unified under Star Alliance management, stating its position as follows: "In order to promote the market for domestic films, resist the cultural aggression of foreign films, increase the effectiveness of anti-Japanese film propaganda, and eliminate the popularity of poisonous and anesthetizing films, in addition to directing the Singapore branch of the China Film Joint Company in the British colony, this company also represents the British colony distribution rights of Hong Kong's DaGuan, LianAn, and GuoGuang companies." It is said that this is Hu Wenhu's first investment in the film industry, and he may actively develop in the film industry in the future.

Unveiling the Solution to the Micro-Answer Game of Two Fishing Golden Turtles (Red to Move and Draw)

Rook 1 retreats 2, Pawn 8 advances, General 4 advances 1, Rook 1 moves to 5, General 4 moves to 5

Rook 2 advances 1, General 5 retreats 1, Cannon 9 advances 3, Rook 1 retreats 6, Pawn 7 advances

General 5 moves to 6, Rook 2 advances 1, General 6 advances 1, Guard 5 moves to 6, Pawn 7 advances

Advisor 5 retreats 4 (variant), Rook 1 advances 4, Rook 2 retreats 1, General 6 advances 1, Rook 2 advances 1

Elephant 5 advances 3, Rook 2 retreats 4, Rook 1 advances 5, Guard 6 advances 1, Elephant 3 retreats 1

Rook 2 moves to 3, Rook 1 moves to 6, Rook 3 moves to 2, Rook 6 moves to 2, Rook 2 advances 4

Rook 2 retreats 4, Guard 6 advances 1, Rook 2 moves to 4, Guard 6 moves to 5, Rook 4 moves to 5

Guard 5 moves to 6, General 6 retreats 1, Rook 2 retreats 1, General 6 retreats 1, Rook 2 retreats 1

Rook 5 moves to 4, Guard 6 moves to 5, Rook 4 moves to 6, Guard 5 moves to 6, Elephant 1 advances 3

Rook 2 moves to 3, General 6 advances 1, Rook 3 advances 1, General 6 advances 1, Rook 3 advances 1

Rook 6 moves to 4, Guard 6 moves to 5, Rook 4 moves to 5, Guard 5 moves to 6, Rook 5 advances 3

Rook 3 moves to 4, General 6 moves to 5, Rook Call moves to 5, General 5 moves to 6, Rook 5 retreats 8

Pawn 6 advances (draw)

(Note) Among the gentlemen who responded to this game, the best one measured that after the advisor 5 retreats 4, the red side abandoned the elephant to draw (that is, rook 1 advances 9 to capture the advisor, and the black rook takes the elephant for checkmate in the middle, easier to draw.) I think that Rook 1 advancing 4 to preserve the red elephant is the correct move. If so, the black rook must stay on roads 1, 2 and 3 when checking the general until road 6-3 so that the red general cannot move to 5 or retreat 1 in order to draw. I think that all are red wins, does Gao Ming agree? Chuan Rong Nian attached for enlightenment.

According to the above methods, it is most reasonable. (Editor)
