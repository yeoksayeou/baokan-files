### French Forces to Defend Vietnam with Two Divisions; Will Use Weapons Stored in Haiphong if Necessary; Chinese Authorities Prepared for Any Development

Chongqing: Chinese newspapers yesterday reported that two French divisions and 300,000 indigenous troops are prepared to protect Vietnam against any possible Japanese invasion. The Chinese newspapers also stated that the French military authorities in Hanoi are prepared to use Chinese weapons and ammunition stored in Haiphong if necessary. (United Press Dispatch of the 12th)

Chongqing: Regarding news of the Franco-Japanese negotiations, Chinese authorities are fully prepared for any developments in Vietnam. Chinese sources believe that Japanese actions pose a threat to Britain that is just as significant as it is to China, because although Japan's current goal is to invade Yunnan, it will eventually invade Burma to threaten Singapore. (Reuters Dispatch of the 12th)

Manila: A reporter who has returned to Manila from Hanoi today, after undergoing a minor inspection, can now inform readers that Japanese supervisors in Vietnam are confident that Japan can gain economic and nominal military control of this French colony without resorting to force. Although the Japanese army in Guangzhou has expressed a desire to invade Vietnam in order to penetrate southwest China and attack Chongqing, Tokyo has not yet been able to determine Washington's attitude. Therefore, the surplus of tin, coal, rice, tungsten, and oil produced in Vietnam is more attractive to the Japanese than a new military adventure in the area. Personnel in the Japanese supervisory group claim that Japan's demands on Vietnam include: (1) allowing the transportation of troops from Haiphong to Kunming; (2) allowing the establishment of a radio station in Hanoi so that Japanese supervisors stationed in Vietnam can communicate with Tokyo and Guangzhou; (3) expelling Chinese residents who have resided in Vietnam for less than ten years; (4) reducing taxes so that Japanese merchants can establish commercial institutions in Vietnam. Six weeks ago, the Vietnamese authorities "invited" Japan to send supervisors to inspect whether France had prohibited Chinese military supplies from being transported to China via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. However, the Japanese supervisory group has continued to grow and now numbers over a hundred people. The number of Japanese destroyers in Haiphong harbor is still unknown. After blockading the railway, the second concession France made was to allow Japanese aircraft to use the Hanoi airfield without restriction. As a result, Japanese military aircraft fly to and from Hanoi every day, apparently reconnaissance flights from Hainan Island and Guangzhou. Furthermore, due to Japanese pressure, the Vietnamese authorities have refused to transport a large quantity of American gasoline to Chongqing. This gasoline was stored in Haiphong when the railway was blockaded. Japan's increasing demands have greatly shocked the French. The Governor-General of Vietnam, Catroux, has adopted a stronger attitude and responded to Japan's numerous demands by stating that they should be negotiated with the Vichy government. Two months ago, Haiphong was a bustling port, full of American merchants, American vehicles, rubber tires, gasoline, and other products. The docks were full of military supplies being shipped to Chongqing. Now, this lively Haiphong has become desolate and lonely. The only visible goods are delivery trucks and gasoline worth US$8 million, which are stored in deserted warehouses because the French refuse to allow them to be exported. Japanese supervisors have been conducting surveys and mapping in northern Vietnam, and Japanese economic experts have been studying how to develop trade and establish businesses in Vietnam. Air power can clearly help Japan adopt strong measures. Vietnam has fewer than fifteen military aircraft, mostly light training aircraft. There are only forty experienced pilots and sixty who have received advanced training. Vietnam's air force is naturally dwarfed by Japan's. Japan not only has an air force near Hainan Island that is superior to Vietnam's, but also has more than two hundred aircraft in bases near Guangzhou. Furthermore, Vietnam lacks modern anti-aircraft guns, and the important port of Haiphong has only two coastal fortifications. The French are now urgently hoping to purchase two hundred fighter planes from the United States for immediate use, but this purchase depends on whether the US Treasury Secretary, Morgenthau, can unfreeze French deposits.

Tokyo: When meeting with news reporters today, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry reiterated the remarks made by then-Foreign Minister Arita on June 7 regarding the South Seas region, saying that he dared to say that the South Seas region would be included in Japan's planned Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. We Japanese believe that stabilizing the regions neighboring Japan is our mission. The spokesman then referred to the remarks made by Foreign Minister Matsuoka to the press on Saturday. When reporters asked for clarification, the spokesman replied that Matsuoka stated that there is now a need to concentrate efforts to build a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere for common prosperity and to resolve the China Incident. The term "coexistence and co-prosperity" has a broad meaning, including political, economic, and cultural aspects. When reporters asked if the planned Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere had a definite boundary, the spokesman replied that he could not provide a clear geographical boundary or list the regions that would be included in this sphere. Someone also asked if the previous Foreign Minister Arita's speech in the Diet, stating that Japan felt its relationship with the South Seas region was only economic, was still valid. The spokesman replied yes. (Reuters Dispatch of the 12th)

### French Troops in China Have Not Considered Withdrawal; American Newspapers Advocate US Taking Over British Defense Zones; Japan Believes Foreign Troops are Unnecessary in Tianjin, Shanghai

Vichy: The French government announced that it has not decided to withdraw its troops stationed in China. A government spokesman told the Associated Press that "this issue has not yet been reviewed." This government statement is considered here to indicate that the PÃ©tain government will not follow Britain's lead and withdraw its troops stationed in China. French sources here point out that Japan is only demanding the withdrawal of troops stationed in China from European belligerent nations, but France is no longer a belligerent nation in Europe. (Associated Press Dispatch of the 12th)

New York: An editorial in the New York Herald Tribune stated that the United States, in view of the situation in Shanghai, "seems to have an obligation to itself and its friends in distress to take over the work of the British troops in Shanghai and reject Japanese interference." (Reuters Dispatch of the 12th)

Washington: After the decision to withdraw British troops from Shanghai and North China, there were rumors that the United States had increased the number of troops sent to China to take over the defense. The State Department recently denied this and said it had not been considered. It is reported that the US Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai originally consisted of only the Fourth Regiment, but when the Sino-Japanese War expanded to the Shanghai area in 1937, the Sixth Regiment was sent to reinforce the defense, and it remains there to this day. (Havas Dispatch of the 11th)

Honolulu: Regarding the rumor that a US Navy ship or destroyer has recently been sent to China to strengthen US forces in the Far East, it was not known here today, and naval authorities denied reports that 700 sailors had been sent to Shanghai or any other port in the East. (Associated Press Dispatch of the 12th)

Beijing: It has recently been learned here that a portion of the British troops stationed in Beijing are scheduled to depart for Tianjin tomorrow, marking the beginning of the British withdrawal. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch of the 12th)

Beijing: Today, there were no soldiers guarding the British Embassy. This situation is the first since the Boxer Rebellion. The East Surrey Regiment, which served as guards for the British Embassy in the Legation Quarter, was relieved of its duties today and departed for Tianjin. The regiment will soon arrive in Shanghai and, along with the British troops stationed in Shanghai, will leave Shanghai for other locations. (Associated Press Dispatch of the 12th)

Tokyo: The Yomiuri Shimbun published an editorial yesterday discussing Anglo-Japanese relations, stating that if Britain believes that withdrawing its troops stationed in the Far East and China can influence Japan's relationship with the Berlin-Rome Axis, it not only proves Britain's lack of judgment regarding the situation in the Far East, but also misunderstands the feelings of the Japanese people and is simply an insult to Japan. The United States may cooperate with Britain. In short, when Britain takes a step back, the United States often takes a step forward. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch of the 12th)

Tokyo: Suma Yakichiro, a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, recently told the press that the Japanese government does not plan to demand that the troops of belligerent nations in China follow Britain's lead and also withdraw their troops. He continued that Japan has the responsibility to maintain peace and order in the occupied areas of China, so foreign troops in that area are unnecessary. When asked if this meant that British troops were not needed in China, Suma did not answer. Regarding whether the negotiations with Vietnam hoped to establish a non-aggression treaty, Suma also declined to comment. (Associated Press Dispatch of the 12th)

Tokyo: At a press conference today, a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated that after the withdrawal of British troops, the commanders of foreign troops stationed in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other locations must discuss measures to maintain public order with the local Japanese military commanders. Tokyo believes that the Japanese military is now responsible for the security of the above-mentioned locations, and there is no need for foreign troops to remain there. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch of the 10th)

Chongqing: Yesterday, the local Shangbao published an article criticizing the British government for failing to inform the Chinese National Government here before deciding to withdraw its troops stationed in China. The newspaper stated that the Central Government had notified Tokyo and Washington of this decision, but not Chongqing. The concessions in Tianjin and Shanghai, as well as the legation area in Beijing, are all Chinese territory, and sovereignty belongs to China. Britain should have first notified the National Government in Chongqing of this decision. The newspaper continued to explain that Britain's troop withdrawal was a sign of its preparation to resist Japanese aggression in the south, but also said that this move might be another example of its "kowtow diplomacy." The newspaper stated that the former of these two reasons for the withdrawal was more logical, as the small number of British troops stationed in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing would not help resist any military attack, but would greatly benefit the defense of Hong Kong and Singapore. (Associated Press Dispatch of the 12th)

Tokyo: A Foreign Ministry spokesman said today that the matter of what to do after the British withdraw their troops from China will be decided by a meeting of the commanders of foreign troops stationed in China. Commanders of foreign troops in China routinely hold meetings to decide on matters related to patrol duties. Now, in order to resolve the issue of which party will take over the patrol areas after the British troops withdraw from Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing, two facts must be taken into account: (1) Japan is now responsible for maintaining security and order in these areas; (2) The situation in China has changed greatly, and there is no longer a need for foreign troops to be stationed to maintain security and order. When asked if the French and Italian governments had indicated that they intended to follow Britain's lead and also withdraw their troops, the spokesman replied that there had been no such indication so far. An American reporter mentioned that the Japanese government had sent notes to European belligerent nations twice, on March 8 of last year and June 10 of this year, urging them to take effective and appropriate steps to eliminate the causes of unforeseen incidents occurring among their troops stationed in China. The reporter asked if the Japanese government currently intended to send notes to European belligerent nations again. The spokesman replied that he did not wish to do so at this time.

### Three Waves of Japanese Aircraft Bomb Ziliujing and Luzhou; Rumors of Bombs Dropped on Jiangjin; Chongqing Issues Two Emergency Air Raid Alerts

Chongqing: This afternoon, three waves of Japanese aircraft heavily bombed Ziliujing in western Sichuan and Luzhou west of Chongqing. It is rumored that two waves of Japanese bombers twice bombed Ziliujing, while the third wave bombed Luzhou. There are also rumors that Japanese bombers dropped several bombs on Jiangjin, south of Chongqing, but this has not been confirmed. When the Japanese aircraft were on their way to bomb western Sichuan and on their return, they passed over Chongqing, so two emergency air raid alerts were issued here. The alert was issued from 11:00 AM until 2:30 PM when the all-clear was sounded. The Japanese aircraft did not fly into the city. Chinese fighter planes circled over Chongqing, waiting to intercept the Japanese aircraft.

Editorial

### China's New Life and Youth

China's war of resistance has lasted for three years. During these three years, some nations in the world have either succumbed without a fight or been defeated in war one after another. Their territories have been lost, their sovereignty destroyed, and their lives and all their destinies entrusted to the hands of strong enemies. From then on, their desolate years and bleak futures, and all that is most cruel and tragic in the human world, will have no end. China, on the other hand, has overcome the strong with the weak, the crooked with the straight, the violent with the sorrowful, the unprepared with the prepared, and the unassisted with self-reliance and much assistance, thus creating a new life for the nation. This new life has its supreme value, and its creation is worth the supreme price and without any complaints. Looking back at the past three years, on the front lines and in the rear, directly and indirectly, the military and civilians have been killed and injured, and materials have been destroyed. The number of sacrifices is incalculable. But looking forward to thousands of years of glory and brilliance, this is what the people of the nation are willing to fight for and follow each other to achieve. Even in the present, the odds of victory are in hand, success is not far away, and vitality is booming throughout the free land. All the thriving phenomena are incomparable to those before the war, which is the most realistic harvest of the three years of resistance and construction. The Executive Yuan of the National Government recently organized a political affairs inspection team, composed of central cadres, who went to Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and other provinces to investigate the political situation, folk customs, and social economy. According to the report, all localities are able to overcome hardships and develop construction vigorously, and the universality of the results and the speed of progress are unexpected. The report is gratifying and most worthy of being told to the general public and youth of Shanghai. The report stated that "the prosperity of the interior provides opportunities for the development of trained and experienced talents"; it also stated that "the greatest difficulty lies in the lack of technical talents, and workers are also extremely scarce, and there are not enough trained intellectuals to guide emerging industries"; it also stated that "there are now a large number of important positions that require properly experienced talents"; it also stated that "various economic undertakings are making huge profits." All of these situations are the opposite of Shanghai.

Speculation is rampant in Shanghai, and only a small number of people are involved in it. The abnormal prosperity has also shown signs of decline recently. There are three things that Shanghai deeply suffers from: first, the abundance of idle capital; second, the large number of unemployed people; and third, the youth are at a loss. Residents are either living extravagantly or suffering from rising prices and difficult lives, which is a direct consequence of the abundance of idle capital. As for unemployment, the weakness of the unemployed themselves accounts for a small part of the problem, and the main reason is that there are too few legitimate production industries. The few remaining industries are either outwardly strong but inwardly weak, or isolated, and cannot be developed, so it is difficult to absorb a large amount of labor. Compared with the actual situation in the vast interior mentioned above, it is not only as different as heaven and earth, but also as different as life and death, prosperity and decline, like different worlds. As for the youth, the majority of Shanghai youth are either worried about not being able to attend school, or worried about not being able to use what they have learned, or worried about what they have learned and used not being helpful to the nation in this great era. Therefore, they either tend to be extreme or degenerate. Those who do not know where to go are at a loss. In view of the actual situation in the vast interior mentioned above, we know that the times urgently need young people, and the nation urgently needs young people, but the majority of young people in Shanghai are suffering from not being able to meet the urgent needs! Why are they unable to meet the needs? Being extreme means not following the normal path, being decadent means not improving oneself, not being able to humbly accept training, not being able to diligently accumulate experience, not being able to work hard to acquire a skill and become a technical talent, not being able to endure hardship and still considering oneself an intellectual and not knowing that workers are respectable and precious and still disdaining to be workers. Because of these reasons, the cowardly hesitate, the mediocre fall behind, the absurd abandon themselves, and the reckless go against the tide. Therefore, it is said that they are unable to meet the urgent needs of the times and the nation. Aspiring young people must study hard and must be ambitious. The great era of the nation is an era for young people to contribute their efforts and develop their talents. The nation's new life is being created, and those who will be the cadres of the new life in the future must be the aspiring, ambitious, and educated young people of today. And the young people of today can only cherish and strive to create their own future!

### Anti-British Sentiment Revives in Japan; Mass Meeting Held Yesterday; Urges Government to Implement Diplomatic Offensive; Demonstrations in Nagasaki and Other Places

Hong Kong: News from Tokyo says that the National Anti-British Conference was held this afternoon in Hibiya Park in Tokyo, hosted by members of the city council. Representatives from six major cities and more than thirty major towns and cities across the country, as well as tens of thousands of Tokyo citizens, unanimously agreed to strengthen the relationship between the Japan-Germany-Italy Axis and passed two resolutions: (1) Urging the Japanese government to implement a diplomatic offensive in accordance with its own independent position and to adopt a tough policy towards Britain. (2) Accusing Britain of being an enemy of the New East Asia and warning Central England to adopt a policy of non-interference in East Asia. (3) Sending letters to the Italian and German ambassadors, guaranteeing that Japan will strengthen the relationship between the Japan-Germany-Italy Axis and cooperate with Germany and Italy to carry out the work of establishing a new world order to overwhelm Britain. The above resolutions were sent to the four ministers of the Premier, Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy, as well as the British, German, and Italian ambassadors to Japan. It is also reported that anti-British demonstrations were also held in Nagoya, Nagasaki, Wakayama, Hamamatsu, and other places in western Japan. (Dispatch of the 12th)

Tokyo: The anti-British sentiment of the Japanese people, which had been relatively quiet in the past few days, has now revived. Meetings were held throughout Japan yesterday to oppose British actions and demand that the Japanese government adopt tough countermeasures. Notices have been found in Tokyo's main thoroughfares urging Japanese people to attend a mass anti-British rally to be held at 1:30 PM today. The purpose of the rally is ostensibly to protest Britain's arrest of Japanese residents, but in reality, it is to oppose Britain's general foreign policy. It is expected that after the meeting, representatives will go to the British Embassy to demonstrate. Last year, there was an incident in which demonstrators climbed over the British Embassy gate and beat the doorman. It is not yet known what form of police protection will be given to the British Embassy today to prevent a recurrence of the incident. According to newspaper reports, the British Consulate in Osaka requested police protection to prevent demonstrators from causing trouble, but this was rejected by the Japanese side. Japanese patriotic groups have also ordered Japanese translators at the British Consulate in Osaka to resign, and servants privately employed within the British Embassy in Tokyo have also received threats of immediate dismissal or death. British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie recently went to the mountains for a short vacation and is scheduled to return to Tokyo today. (Reuters Dispatch of the 12th)

Tokyo: A mass anti-British rally will be held in Hibiya Park this afternoon. At noon, the masses have already begun to gather, and thousands of curious people have been watching the preparations for the rally since dawn. Hibiya Park is now full of flags, decorated with flowers, and at the entrance of the park, the German and Italian flags are hung high next to the Japanese flag. (Reuters Dispatch of the 12th)

Tokyo: A mass anti-British movement occurred here today, but the planned demonstration at the British Embassy did not materialize. (Associated Press Dispatch of the 12th)

Tokyo: The large-scale anti-British demonstration in Tokyo has passed peacefully without any accidents. The police were well-prepared and achieved remarkable results. The area around Hibiya Park, where the mass meeting was held, was patrolled by police, and a special guard was stationed in front of the British Embassy to prevent disturbances. The rally quietly disbanded after passing ordinary resolutions against Britain and supporting the Axis powers, lasting an hour and a half, and did not even attempt to go to the British Embassy. British people were favorably impressed by the effective police control and the avoidance of unexpected incidents. It may be too early to say that the recent stage of Anglo-Japanese tension has passed, but all indications show that the authorities are trying to avoid causing a severe break for the time being.

### US Compulsory Conscription Bill Expected to Pass; Defense Council Asks Industry Not to Forget Cooperation with the Government

Washington: The fate of the compulsory conscription bill, which is a landmark event in American peacetime history, rests on the hands of twenty undecided US senators. According to INS, an informal vote showed that 38 senators supported the proposal and 38 opposed it, while the remaining 20 had not yet decided. Senator Sheppard of Texas and other supporters are confident that the bill will pass. At the same time, opponents of the bill applauded the strong opposition of American labor unions. The bill stipulates that 12 million people between the ages of 21 and 31 must be forcibly registered for military service and that a military force of 1.5 million men must be established within two years to deal with the threat of American invasion.

Washington: The American Defense Council yesterday solemnly informed the national industrial sector again, asking them not to forget that Roosevelt has the power to order factories to temporarily suspend all private transactions and expedite the production of orders for the Army and Navy. After disclosing the results of the current production investigation, the Council announced that there was no need to exercise its power under the bill signed on June 28. However, it warned in advance that "to ensure the fulfillment of contracts with tentative delivery dates, the continuation of the voluntary system depends on whether the cooperation between the industrial sector and the government is satisfactory.

### Hoover Urges Action to Prevent Famine in Four Countries

New York - Former U.S. President Hoover and Republican presidential candidate Willkie, following a meeting in Colorado Springs, issued an appeal last night calling for realistic and swift action to prevent hunger, death, and disease in the four countries of the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, and Poland. The New York weekly criticized Germany's interpretation of Hoover's action, stating that food is a war material, and it would be foolish for the United States to provide aid to Britain on one hand, while on the other hand participating in actions that shatter what Britain considers its greatest weapon and its greatest hope for survival. (Reuters, 12th)

London - According to well-informed sources here, regarding the reports from New York that former U.S. President Hoover had issued an appeal calling for action to facilitate the supply of food to German-occupied areas, no such request has been received here. As for the reports that 18 million people in German-occupied areas are currently facing famine, it is claimed that the German government often declares that this is due to the British blockade, that the British blockade has failed, and that the supply of food within Germany is very sufficient.

### British Secretary of State for India Amery Delivers Speech, Supports Consultation with India on Self-Governance, All-India Congress Committee to Meet on the 18th

London - Secretary of State for India Amery, in a speech last night in Liverpool, indicated that Indian leaders could join the Governor-General's Executive Council to support India's efforts in the war. He said that observing the contribution of dominion troops to Britain in defending common ideals shows the success of Britain in granting freedom to its colonies. Britain is now applying this same principle to India, which today unanimously detests Nazi tyranny. If dominion status can be achieved after the war, then why not have preliminary consultations during the war? Amery, referring to the war situation, said, "We are now facing the storms of the future alone. Whatever form the attack on London takes, we are prepared. If Hitler believes that a massive air raid can break our spirit, he is greatly mistaken. If Hitler takes such action, he is destined for a disastrous defeat, and his failure will bring the war to an early end. Hitler may hope to send air forces to aid the Italian offensive against Egypt, Africa, and the Near East; if so, we welcome it. Such action by Hitler will not protect the center of Germany from being attacked by the British Air Force. Britain can face the horrors that will occur in the coming weeks with unwavering faith, and make any sacrifices necessary to recover Europe and overseas territories. The German Empire is built on the foundation of contempt for all morality and laws, and sooner or later it will collapse, and we will awaken from the nightmare of war and see that we have preserved ourselves through our efforts and have preserved the world through our example." (Reuters, 12th)

Bombay - President of the All-India National Congress, Acharya Kripalani, told a Reuters correspondent today that he does not intend to meet with the Governor-General at present, as he does not see any basis or scope for the two sides to meet and continue discussions.

Viceroy Linlithgow, after announcing British policy towards India, had invited Acharya Kripalani to meet with him during the period of August 11th to 20th. Former President of the All-India National Congress, Nehru, stated in Kanpur that the Governor-General's proposal and the Congress's demands are still far apart. (Reuters, 12th)

Soviet Newspaper Commentary: The British-Indian Question

Moscow - Regarding India's demand for independence, the newspaper Pravda commented, "The British ruling class is still extremely worried about the situation in India. This can be proven by the speech of the British Secretary of State for India and Burma. The British side's allowing the constitution to be amended after the war is nothing more than a means to deal with the Indian people's demands for independence. British capitalism intends to include India in the imperial war plan, but the Indian people's thinking has made this work even more complicated for the British side. India's liberation movement is growing daily, and even Gandhi may find it difficult to stop it. Although Britain has used all its strength, it has been unable to reach a compromise with India. Even with the most moderate political elements in India, Britain has been unable to compromise. This is extremely unfavorable to Britain's war and has weakened the position of British imperialism."

### Japanese and German Joint Venture to Establish Two Electricity Companies

Tokyo - Minister of Commerce and Industry Kobayashi Ichizo recently told the Japan Times that when he accompanied the Japanese economic delegation to Germany and Italy in April of this year, in his capacity as chairman of the board of the Tokyo Electric Light Company, he negotiated with the German General Electric Company on behalf of the company, intending to establish two electricity companies in Tokyo and within China through a Japanese-German joint venture. Now the negotiations have been completed and a contract has been signed. Once approved by the two governments, it can be implemented. The capital of the newly established company will be divided equally among the German General Electric Company, the Tokyo Electric Light Company, and the Okura Trading Company in Tokyo. In China, the German side and the Japanese side will each be jointly responsible. The business of the new company is to lay electrical currents and manufacture various electrical appliances, such as electrical machinery, wireless equipment, electric clocks, and electric fans.

### Wartime Finances of Britain and Germany: Analysis by German Minister of Economic Affairs Funk

KÃ¶nigsberg - German Minister of Economic Affairs Funk gave a speech at the opening ceremony of the KÃ¶nigsberg Trade Fair yesterday, stating briefly that Germany's economic potential is extremely strong, and that all resources can not only supply the country's wartime needs, but also focus on production and engage in export trade. Due to the war in Western Europe and the disruption of overseas transportation, the center of European goods exchange has now shifted to Eastern and Southeastern Europe. Since the Vistula River has been placed under German sovereignty, and communication between the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea has been established, it has become important in North-South transportation in Eastern Europe, just as the Danube River has been important in East-West transportation for centuries. Comparing Britain's post-war imbalanced foreign trade with Germany's current economic success further highlights the abundance of German wartime finance. The principle of German wartime finance is to increase the production of wartime necessities and limit the production of daily necessities. Conversely, in Britain, the people must fight for the necessary products themselves, resulting in soaring prices and economic chaos, which is detrimental to the war effort. Funk continued that European political unity and economic cooperation are necessary to promote European economic life. European countries must cooperate sincerely with Germany and Italy to achieve this goal. The Axis powers are also the guarantors of European economic order. Germany has no intention of hating international trade and no intention of abandoning international trade. Germany's policy is self-sufficiency, not isolation. Free trade has not been seen for centuries. After 1931, countries took political measures to implement so-called "free trade" in an attempt to promote industry and commerce, but the Ottawa Agreement and the Pan-American cartel plan do not contain the meaning of a free economy.

### Guangdong Province Rice Shortage Has Been Resolved

Hong Kong - The rice shortage in Guangdong Province has been gradually resolved after Chairman Li Han-hun successfully negotiated the import of 3 million dan (ç³) from Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi provinces. Most of the rice is transported to Guangdong from Hunan by train and bus, as Hunan's rice production is high and the price is low. However, because most of the roads in Hunan Province have been damaged, transporting rice is not easy. The Dongjiang area has been suffering from famine for more than a year due to the Chinese coast being blockaded and the province's harvest being poor. Guangdong Province's rice production has always been insufficient to meet its own needs and must import foreign rice from Vietnam, Siam, and Burma. Now that these three routes have been closed, it can only rely on Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi. When the Chinese legal currency had not depreciated, the price of foreign rice was not very expensive, but now eating Hunan rice is cheaper. If transportation does not become completely impossible, then this important issue related to people's livelihood has been resolved by General Li, and the courage of the Chinese people during the war of resistance has also been encouraged. It is reported that after the Guangdong government purchased rice from neighboring provinces, it was sold at the purchase price plus transportation costs, so the price of rice has fallen from one catty (æ¤) per yuan of legal currency to four or five catties per yuan. In the occupied areas, including Guangzhou, the price of rice is two or three catties per yuan. The Guangdong government had previously obtained special permission from the Chongqing Ministry of Finance to purchase a certain amount of foreign rice tax-free and store it here to prevent famine. Now that the food panic has passed, this stored rice will be kept for future needs. Guangdong Province has many mountains, and farmland cannot be expanded as much as possible, but the fundamental plan is to increase the province's rice production. According to the opinions of agricultural experts, improving irrigation, using fertilizers, and adopting modern agricultural equipment are all fundamental solutions. They all say that Guangdong Province's climate is more suitable than other rice-producing provinces. (International News Service, 12th)

### Jin Baoshan Talks About Epidemic Prevention

Chongqing - A Central News Agency reporter visited Director of the Department of Health Jin Baoshan on the morning of the 11th to inquire about the general epidemic prevention situation this year. He said that malaria is prevalent in various places this year, which has a very important impact on the health of the military and civilians and the national economy. In addition to setting up anti-malaria teams in special epidemic areas, the Department has also allocated quinine pills and other medicines to general malaria epidemic areas. It is not possible to eradicate malaria in our country under the current economic conditions and environment. We should first actively promote the important points of anti-malaria, and pay attention to (1) malaria patients should pay attention to their recurrence, (2) during the day, pay attention to indoor light, so as to reduce the hiding of mosquitoes and flies, (3) mosquito nets should be set up at night, and weeds should be removed and ditches and pits should be filled in peacetime. As for Chongqing, in addition to having issued quinine pills and handed them over to the Health Bureau for distribution, the Department has also directly handed them over to various health centers and medical and epidemic prevention teams in the resettlement area for use.

### Important New Developments in U.S.-Japan Relations: Japan Receives U.S. Reply to Protest, U.S. Trade Declines

Washington - An authoritative Far East observer recently stated that important progress in U.S.-Japan relations can be seen in the U.S. reply to Japan's protest against the gasoline blockade and in the issue of the Shanghai International Settlement. Some well-informed sources believe that Britain, in order to prevent a crisis from occurring, is prepared to take a firm stance against Japan's violation of the sovereignty of the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam. These people also speculate that the United States, in its reply to Japan's protest, may have solemnly stated the U.S. attitude. (United Press, 12th)

Tokyo - The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs today received the U.S. government's reply to Japan's protest, stating that the ban on aviation gasoline is due to military reasons and is not aimed at any country. The United States has no intention of discriminating against Japan. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

Tokyo - The Japan Chronicle recently published an article stating that after the Konoe Cabinet recently announced its diplomatic policy, various American newspapers commented that there is little hope for improving the economic relationship between Japan and the United States. Japan has always believed that the evolution of U.S.-Japan relations can be seen from the American public opinion. Therefore, the tone of American newspapers is highly regarded by the middle management here. Recently, the trade relationship between Britain and Japan has been declining, especially since the United States banned the export of machine tools, scrap iron, and kerosene. In previous years, American merchants have placed orders with Japan for goods for Christmas sales, but this year there has been a significant decrease. People in the exchange market are quite worried. As for Japan's main exports to the United States, raw silk is the largest. This year has also seen a decline. The export volume has reached 21,000 bales only in July, and has not exceeded 20,000 bales in other months. Even in terms of the export volume in July, it has decreased by one-third compared with the same month last year. In general, under the current international situation, the decline in trade between the United States and Japan will further intensify. In Japan, in order to reduce dependence on the United States, it is necessary to immediately adjust various organizations in domestic industry and commerce. (Havas News Agency, 11th)

### British and Italian Main Forces in Somaliland Come into Contact, British Air Force Attacks Italian Camps in North Africa and Patrols in Desert Areas

Rome - According to the Italian military headquarters, Italian forces have entered British Somaliland and have come into contact with the main British forces. (Haitong News Agency, 11th)

London - The Daily Telegraph reported that Rome has claimed that the Italian attack on British Somaliland is to obtain naval and air bases in order to occupy Aden and destroy Britain's control in the Red Sea. At present, it is undoubtedly important for the Italian side to break through the blockade line that cuts off its communication with the Eastern Hemisphere. However, because the Italian side has long occupied one side of the narrow strait of the Red Sea into the Indian Ocean, the Italian people may question Mussolini as to why he does not use the ports there. Little do they know that Italy has no navy for its East African ports, nor does it have ships to dispatch. One of the newspaper's reporters recalled the recent journey from Suez to Aden, saying that within 1,300 miles, no Italian ships were seen, while British ships came and went in the Red Sea almost every day, transporting military supplies. The ability of the British naval and air forces to maintain the unobstructed flow of trade routes will not be shaken by whether there are Italian troops on the coast of Somaliland. We frankly admit that if Britain withdraws from Somaliland, it will inevitably suffer a loss of prestige, but if this military invasion prevents us from focusing on the plan to defend Egypt, then the harm will be even more serious. It is expected that the cooperation of British naval and air forces can make Egypt's defense stable. (Reuters, 12th)

Rome - According to Italian military experts, the battle in British Somaliland has now entered the third stage. The first stage was the battle in the desert area on the Abyssinian Somaliland border. The second stage was the entry of Italian forces into the mountainous area of British Somaliland, up to the occupation of the Kalina Pass and the Goda Jer Pass. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

Sofia - It has been learned that seventy-two members of the Bulgarian Parliament have raised questions about the government's foreign policy.

### Tensions Rise Between Italy and Greece, Albanians Demand Return of Lost Territory

Rome - Relations between Italy and Greece have become tense again due to the assassination of Albanian Haki StÃ«rmilli by Greeks. StÃ«rmilli advocated that Greece should return the province of Chameria, which it annexed in 1913, to Albania. (United Press, 12th)

Rome - The Italian news agency Tirana reported that an Albanian patriot named Haki StÃ«rmilli was assassinated by Greeks on the border between Greece and Albania. A few years ago, the Greek government offered a reward for StÃ«rmilli's head because StÃ«rmilli advocated that the Chameria border region should be ceded to Albania. It is rumored that the assassins cut off StÃ«rmilli's head and paraded it in several villages in Chameria as a warning. In recent months, there have been incidents of oppression of Albanians in Chameria. (Reuters, 12th) Southern Capital City - There are rumors that the Albanian people oppose the Italian side's conscription of Albanians into the army and the requisition of food and livestock, and have rebelled. The Italian side sent troops to quell the rebellion, and the two sides clashed near the southern border on Friday night. There is still no confirmed news here. (Reuters, 12th)

Rome - Yesterday's report from Tirana by the Stefani News Agency has attracted the attention of political figures here. It is said that the Albanian expatriates residing in the Xamuria region of Greece have been subjected to various abuses. For example, Haki StÃ«rmilli, who advocated the restoration of Albanian territory, was murdered by Greek spies not far from the Greek border (still within Albanian territory), and his head was taken to Greece. It was ordered to pass around StÃ«rmilli's head to various villages along the border for public display, with the intention of threatening the Albanian people. The Xamuria region was annexed by Greece in 1913. At that time, there were 80,000 Albanians, but now there are only about 50,000 Albanians in the region, still accounting for the majority of local residents. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

Rome - According to authoritative sources, after the Greek assassination of Albanian Haki StÃ«rmilli, Italy will issue a strong protest to the Greek government. This brutal action has made a deep impression in Rome. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

### Soviet Government Reception for Representatives of the Baltic States, Representatives Praise Soviet Leaders

Moscow â A grand banquet was held at the Kremlin the night before last to receive representatives from the Baltic states and the Bessarabian region. During the banquet, Molotov introduced Lithuanian Prime Minister Merkys to deliver a speech. When Merkys began his speech, everyone stood up and applauded enthusiastically, paying tribute to the liberated people of Lithuania.

After meeting with Comrades Stalin and Molotov, we have become even more aware of our responsibilities and the need to rebuild the lives of the Lithuanian people under the banner of Lenin and Stalin. The teachings of the great Stalin are the compass for our work. We are deeply grateful for the concern of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government for the Lithuanian people. With Soviet assistance, the Lithuanian people have achieved their common hope. The delegation of plenipotentiary representatives to the People's Assembly includes Communist and non-Party members. The Lithuanian people's trust in the Soviet Union is self-evident. We firmly believe that under the guidance of Comrade Stalin, the Lithuanian people will surely achieve unprecedented prosperity in history." After Merkys finished his speech, everyone cheered, and the sounds of Lithuanian and Russian resounded throughout the venue. Next, Estonian Prime Minister Vares delivered a speech, saying, "Dear comrades, we are now living in an unforgettable historical period. During this period, new Soviet socialist republics have been created. We have shown the greatness and invincibility of Lenin, Stalin, and the ideas of the Soviet regime to the whole world. During this period of imperialist bloodshed, only Stalin's policy of peace and friendship among all nationalities can guarantee a peaceful life. The people of the Baltic Sea are spared the horrors of war thanks to the wise policies of the Soviet Union and Stalin. On behalf of all the liberated people of Estonia, I would like to express my gratitude to the great Soviet Union, the Soviet government led by Molotov, and the wise national father of all nationalities, the true leader of mankind, Stalin."

KirhenÅ¡teins' speech was very moving, and he also represented the Latvian people in paying tribute to and expressing gratitude to Stalin and Molotov. In his speech, the Latvian Prime Minister also reported on the recent situation in Latvia in a pleasant tone, saying, "The Latvian people are extremely pleased to join the Soviet Union. This enthusiastic sentiment has been expressed in factories and villages. People all over the world are now watching us. Therefore, we should show the people of the world with the facts of building a new life." After KirhenÅ¡teins finished his speech, he raised his glass to bless the Soviet government and its leaders Molotov, Voroshilov, Kalinin, and Stalin, who are always loved by the Latvian people.

### Britain and Germany Vie for Air Supremacy, Large-Scale Air Battles in Progress, Both Sides Claim Victory in the Battle of Portland, German Air Force Attacked Portsmouth Again Yesterday

London â More than 500 German bombers and fighter planes launched a whirlwind attack on Britain and its key southern ports yesterday. The British Air Force joined forces to defend Britain and was quite successful. German planes repeatedly flew over the southern sky, humming and dropping bombs on seaports, military police zones, and escort ships in the English Channel. The British Ministry of Aviation stated at dusk that the British Air Force's counterattack was very successful. The German Air Force was scattered and fled after being attacked, and 75 German planes were shot down. (International dispatch, 12th)

London â Military observers have recently commented that German air raids have become increasingly fierce, and their targets are no longer limited to cities and ships, but are launching large-scale attacks on major areas of the southern coast of Britain. Yesterday, many German fighter planes also fiercely attacked "barrage balloons." In this way, Germany's attacks on Britain can be said to have already begun a "lightning air war." In addition, the German army has sealed off the coast of the English Channel and is carrying out large-scale preparations. However, it is still unknown whether they intend to land on the British coast. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

London â A hundred German planes appeared over the southeastern coast today. British fighters intercepted them. It was previously reported that five enemy planes were shot down, three of which fell into the English Channel. In addition, several others were damaged. Details of the air battle are still unknown. An invading enemy bomber flew over the northeast coast today and was shot down. One crew member was killed and three were captured. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

Berlin â German planes suddenly attacked Portsmouth, the largest military port in southern England. According to the latest news, when German bombers and fighter planes attacked the port this morning, British planes did not actively engage them. At the same time, four barrage balloons over Dover were shot down. A fierce air battle took place at the time. German planes shot down five British planes, and one German plane went missing. Portsmouth has several naval schools, a submarine school, and a naval research institute, as well as 3,000 acres of dockyards that can accommodate the largest battleships and aircraft carriers. The coastal artillery and anti-aircraft artillery have sufficient strength. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 12th)

Berlin â The German military department issued a statement regarding the results of yesterday's attack on a British merchant ship convoy, stating that the German Air Force attacked 20 kilometers northwest of the Strait of Megate. The British ships were sailing southwest. According to news sent by German planes, several enemy ships have been hit, some of which have stopped sailing, and there have been many casualties. An air battle then took place. It is now confirmed that five Spitfires and two bombers were shot down. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 12th)

Berlin â A radio report from German military planes has just been received, stating that 40 German bombers and fighter planes launched a surprise attack on the important British naval base of Portsmouth this morning. A fierce air battle ensued, and 23 British planes were shot down. Six German planes were lost. From 11:00 to 12:00 this afternoon, an air battle also took place in the Margate area. German planes surprised a British convoy and launched a sudden attack. The anti-aircraft fire from British warships was the fiercest. German planes still completed their mission of surprise bombing and dropping bombs. Five British planes were lost, and all German planes returned safely to their original defenses. Four British ships were sunk, totaling 10,000 tons, and several other ships were hit and caught fire. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)

Berlin â Two German destroyers and fighter planes unrelated to the air battle in the English Channel shot down two bombers and two Spitfires. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)

German Air Force Suffers Major Setback

London â In yesterday's air battle between British and German planes, no fewer than 60 German planes were shot down. The intensity of the battle was no less than the battle last Thursday, in which 60 German planes were destroyed. Germany's attempt to seize air superiority over the English Channel and British skies suffered another major setback. According to a naval bulletin, as of 9:00 last night, the reports received were not yet complete, but it was known that 60 German planes had been shot down, five of which were shot down by anti-aircraft artillery. The British fighters also lost 26 planes, but the pilots of two planes were still safe. Yesterday's air battle zone stretched from the Thames Estuary to beyond the Solent, and Portland and Weymouth were attacked particularly fiercely. According to a joint bulletin from the three departments of aviation, navy, and internal security, several houses were bombed and damaged, some of which were severely damaged. Traffic was also slightly damaged. An oil pool caught fire and was quickly extinguished. Several people were injured, but there were few serious injuries. Only one person was reported to have died. When Portland was attacked, two British ships were hit by debris and suffered minor damage. All other ships were unharmed. However, bombs that fell on the shore slightly damaged naval buildings, including a hospital. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

British Fighters Act Quickly

London â A Reuters reporter happened to be at the Southern Air Force Command in Britain yesterday morning. It was reported that German planes began to attack at dawn and soon became fierce. The commander in charge of protecting the strait ports and shipping issued orders or listened to reports by telephone every few minutes. It was evident that the Spitfire and Hurricane British fighters far from the coast were in fierce battles. Yesterday's victory of the British Air Force was quickly launched. By noon, it had been confirmed that 18 German planes that attacked British ships separately from the Thames to outside the Solent had been lost. Another 32 German planes were damaged, many of which were believed to have been completely destroyed. The British army, navy, and air force were extremely thorough in their reconnaissance. When they saw large groups of German planes taking off from bases on the European coast, they gave advance warnings for prevention. The Air Force Commander once said that Britain would never be caught off guard. This statement has been proved true. After two attacks by German planes yesterday, there were enemy traces in the lower reaches of the strait. Two teams of British Spitfires flew to intercept about a hundred German planes. Soon, more German planes joined the battle. The British Air Force did not want to use all of its fighters to protect one part of the coast, but if Hitler sent more German planes to seize air superiority, the British fighters were prepared to give them a head-on blow. British planes acted as quickly as fire engines. Three or four minutes after receiving a warning, they flew into the danger zone and opened fire, with bullets as dense as water sprayed from a fire hose. A delay of two minutes would have prevented a successful interception. In the first air battle yesterday, British fighters shot down seven German planes into the sea, including five fighters and two bombers. These seven planes were part of the 50 German planes that attempted to sneak into British territory at high altitude under the protection of fighters. However, after encountering a large group of British planes, the German planes were hit by bullets and fled in panic. The shot down planes fell into the sea seven miles from the shore. It was reported that many houses were damaged in a town on the southwestern coast. Many residences within half a square mile in a densely populated area were destroyed. A bomb in a brewery was destroyed. When a church was praying, enemy planes suddenly dropped bombs, and the windows were shattered. However, the children hid behind the walls and continued to sing hymns. When British fighters intercepted German planes, British bombers flew out to attack German military targets. According to the Ministry of Aviation, British planes bombed several German-occupied airfields within the borders of Belgium and France, such as Schiphol, Cherbourg, and the flying port of Guernsey, as well as the airfields of Flours and others. Two planes were lost after bombs hit the hangars. Until night, British planes fiercely bombed German military targets again, such as the Hamburg shipyards, the Wilhelmshaven naval base, the oil depots of Frankfurt and Homburg, the Cologne power station and explosives factory, chemical factories, docks, warehouses, and several airfields within the German border of the Netherlands, were all targets of British bombing. One British plane was lost in this battle. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

German Planes Retreat from Guernsey

London â The Aviation Ministry's intelligence office stated that after the British Air Force attacked Guernsey on Friday, the Germans have apparently moved their planes away from the area. When British planes attacked northwestern Germany, they bombed the Frankfurt oil depot. The first batch of British bombers attacked the target for an hour and a half. After a bomb hit the Cologne explosives factory, there was a loud explosion and flames flew everywhere. Also, after a British bomber dropped a bomb on the Flours airfield, it suddenly saw a German plane, believed to be a Henschel Hs 126, which was hit by a German anti-aircraft shell and blown to pieces. This type of German plane is similar to the British Westland Lysander army cooperation aircraft. It is likely that the German anti-aircraft gunners were flustered and confused during the British bombing and mistook the German plane for a British plane, resulting in this mistake. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

Germany Claims Great Victory

Berlin â Regarding the air battle in the English Channel on Sunday, the German Supreme Command declared, "In addition to the devastating bombing of the British naval base in Portland, the buildings in the oil pool port were hit and caught fire. Fifty-seven enemy planes were shot down. In addition, three merchant ships were sunk, totaling approximately 17,000 tons. A destroyer and three merchant ships were heavily damaged in the bombing. In the attack on the convoy, 17 enemy planes were shot down. Eight other enemy planes were shot down elsewhere. Over Dover, German planes destroyed eight defensive balloons and simultaneously shot down seven British destroyers. A total of eighty-nine enemy planes were lost on Sunday. Seventeen German planes did not return." (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 12th)

Berlin â This afternoon's German war report stated that German planes attacked the British military port of Portland yesterday, and many port facilities were destroyed. The oil pool caught fire, and two merchant ships and a destroyer were heavily damaged. At the nearby port of Weymouth, a 3,000-ton merchant ship was sunk. In the Thames Estuary, several ships in a British convoy encountered German bombing. As a result, three ships (17,000 tons) were sunk, and two destroyers and four ships were hit by bombs and suffered heavy damage. Last night, German planes bombed aircraft factories in Feltham and Crewe, as well as port facilities in Cardiff and Bristol. In addition, the oil pool and anti-aircraft artillery positions in Avonmouth were hit in several places. Enemy planes flew over northern and western Germany last night and attacked non-military targets, with no significant results. In total, enemy planes lost 90 planes in air battles yesterday, and 21 German planes went missing. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)

### British Air Force Gradually Gains Advantage Over Germany, Cooper Delivers Speech

London â Minister of Information Cooper gave a speech to the public in Sow Zehufu last night, saying that Britain not only maintains its maritime hegemony, but is also gradually gaining air superiority. Although the enemy has more planes than we do, each time we engage, the enemy's advantage gradually decreases, and Britain's hope increases. Today, British planes shot down 60 more enemy planes from the sky. Germany prepared for so long, and at this critical moment of war, it revealed its inferiority in terms of both planes and pilots. This is a very important fact. British pilots are now flying out day and night to seek battle, and enemy planes retreat when they see them. Now, as a result of each air battle, the number of British bombers and fighters is gradually approaching the number of enemy planes. The British Air Force will eventually gain air superiority, just as the British Navy does at sea. Many people listened, and Prime Minister Churchill's wife also sat on the podium. The crowd welcomed her very much. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### British Transport Ship Sunk by Mine, More Than a Hundred People Drowned

London â The 7,290-ton Muhammad Ali Kebir, a British transport ship, was sunk by a torpedo from a German submarine in the Atlantic. It is feared that 120 people were killed, mostly soldiers. The ship was carrying a total of 860 people and was bombed at night. It sank within two hours. A ship happened to be nearby and immediately rescued 740 survivors, who have landed at a port in Scotland. The captain, chief mate, radio operator, and two doctors are missing. When the transport ship was hit by a mine and capsized, many soldiers jumped out of the ship. Most of them drowned due to the wind and waves. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

London â According to an official announcement, the British fishing boat Edwardian (348 tons) shot down an enemy dive bomber yesterday and also destroyed another one. It is feared that it will not be able to return to its base. The ship suffered a small number of casualties. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### Gibraltar Attacked Again

Algeciras â At 4:40 yesterday afternoon, several planes of unknown nationality attacked Gibraltar again. Although the British anti-aircraft guns opened fire, they did not shoot down any planes. At the same time, two major explosions occurred at the naval arsenal. The planes then flew southeast. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)

London â An army bulletin declared that some foreign newspapers' accounts of the recent air raid on Gibraltar were greatly exaggerated. In fact, the damage and casualties were extremely minor. Gibraltar is prepared for any accidents and crises and has all the necessary resources to cope with them. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### German Air Force Plants Mines in British Ports

Berlin â A German military expert yesterday issued a supplementary war report to the Haitong News Agency reporter, stating that Germany is stepping up the planting of mines in British ports, both large and small. The recent war report that has been published has detailed that the German command is implementing this measure in full compliance with international law during wartime. It has never used drifting mines. Do not listen to the enemy's counter-propaganda. The German Air Force uses a common fighter plane to plant mines. Its structure can drop mines or bombs. German planes have dropped mines outside the ports closed by the British Navy Department with considerable success. It is expected that there will be ship losses. Regarding the enemy plane's night attack on northern and western Germany mentioned in yesterday's war report, it is now known that several villages and towns were bombed. In Kronshagen, near Kiel, several houses were bombed and collapsed, but military targets were not bombed. A naval hospital, 300 meters away from the bombed area, was safe and sound. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)

### German Newspapers Enthusiastically Praise Air Force Victory

Berlin â German newspapers this morning all carried reports about the air battle in the English Channel and the German air victory, claiming that the air battle was very fierce. A total of 89 British planes were shot down. The British naval dock in Portland was severely damaged. Three merchant ships in the convoy sank, and a destroyer and three merchant ships were hit by bombs and destroyed. The Monday Post solemnly stated that the air battle took place in the sky over the Strait, covering a distance of 275 kilometers. Although it was close to the British coast and adjacent to the British base, the German air fleet still achieved a great victory. From then on, it will make the British more aware of the great power of the German Air Force. Dr. Krick, a political reporter for the newspaper, commented on the victory of the German Air Force from a political point of view, saying that Churchill will again create lies to deceive the British people. Was the port of Portland not bombed by German planes? Will Churchill deny the major damage suffered by the British arms industry? In fact, hundreds of thousands of British arms workers already know it. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)

War Records of Europe

### A Record of the Norwegian Female Writer Sigrid Undset's Escape

The author of this article is Mrs. Sigrid Undset, a Norwegian female writer who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1928. Her works are highly regarded by the world, especially her historical novels about Norway in the Middle Ages, which are very popular. Her masterpiece, Kristin Lavransdatter, has sold widely. In April of this year, German troops invaded Norway, and Mrs. Undset traveled a long distance to seek refuge in Sweden. Her eldest son, Anders, died for his country on April 27. She is currently living in Stockholm, Sweden. This article was translated into English by her close friend, Mrs. Harriman, the wife of the American Minister to Norway. The translation is as follows:

Norway has a population of only three million, and life is precious and not easily wasted. The people are diligent and law-abiding, and there are fewer major criminals than in other European countries. In my 58 years, no Norwegian has committed a heinous crime that would warrant the death penalty. The Norwegian people were well aware of the wars that plagued various countries around the world, but they did not believe that they themselves would suffer such a catastrophe. They should have been prepared, but they were still negligent, so that when the German army attacked, they were completely unprepared.

On April 8, I was staying at a hotel in the capital of Norway. At 12:30 in the morning, the air raid alarm went off. I didn't know if it was real or not, so we went to the basement where the air was sealed off, talking and laughing as usual. We didn't expect that the German army had already landed in Norway. The next morning, I went to church and suddenly saw bombers painted with iron crosses flying low in circles. The anti-aircraft guns on the roof fired fiercely but were ineffective. Only then did I realize that the situation was serious. In the morning, I took my youngest son by car back to my hometown of Lillehammer.

On the same day, I learned that the King and the government had rejected the German demand for surrender and were defending themselves with weapons. Although it was not easy to deal with the foreign invasion with the help of internal spies, young men across the country enlisted and went to war enthusiastically. My eldest son joined the army in the morning, and my youngest son, who was not yet of military age, joined the ambulance corps, each working for the country.

After I returned to my old home in Lillehammer, refugees from the capital and Trondheim came in droves, asking for food and help, and we were overwhelmed. Lillehammer was completely undefended, and German planes flew over repeatedly, circling low, but fortunately did not wreak havoc. At that time, the whole scene was filled with the atmosphere of war, and troops passed by in an endless stream.

Unexpectedly, one afternoon, a German transport plane flew low and crashed outside my garden. Innocent women and children rushed to watch, and the pilot fired at them with a machine gun. Fortunately, the army arrived in time, and the pilots either committed suicide with their guns or were captured. Only then did we feel that the war was approaching. On April 20, we were shocked to hear that the British army had abandoned its position in Broton, and the German army would arrive in Lillehammer sooner or later.

My words and deeds have always been against National Socialism, so I followed the advice of a friend and hurriedly went north in a friend's car, carrying only a small suitcase. In the afternoon, I arrived in Hamar in dismay. The next day, I went north by car with a professor I knew well. Near DombÃ¥s, we encountered a bombing, so we took shelter in the forest with hundreds of soldiers, lying flat in a snow cave between two pine trees for two hours. Captain Rosset, the air attachÃ© of the American Legation in Norway, was killed by a bullet that day while trying to take shelter in an air raid shelter. At that time, it was early spring, and the accumulated snow was gradually melting, and rocks and moss were growing. Whenever the roar of planes and cannons subsided slightly, the sound of the wind in the trees could be heard clearly, and the scenery was very pleasant.

Before long, rumors spread that the British and Norwegian forces at the Kletten Pass were in trouble, and a team of ambulances came to set up a field hospital in a school. I, the professor, and six members of his family squeezed into a car and drove north through the night to stay temporarily at the home of a farmer in the Dovre Valley.

The Dovre train station was bombed by German planes every day. I once went with two people to the mountain to watch the planes fighting in the sky over DombÃ¥s. Suddenly, a plane flew low towards us, firing its guns. The bullets landed only two or three yards away from us, so we rushed back to the farm to hide. Fortunately, none of us was injured, which was also very dangerous.

On both sides of the Dovre Valley, the peaks of the Ita Mountains stand tall, with snow that is white and crystal clear. A farmer once compared them to the breasts of women. However, the snow in the valley has almost melted, but the ground is yellow and barren, with no greenery to be seen. On the sunny side of the mountain, old houses are scattered, while new buildings stand in the valley bottom.

The farm where we were staying was not far from Hjerkinn, where a team of German paratroopers had occupied some stone buildings, harassing their neighbors. After the residents forced them with guns, they surrendered. The area was then filled with talk about paratroopers, and the words of an old woman were the most unforgettable. According to the old woman, she knew one of the paratroopers, who had walked to her farm one summer, begging for food and lodging, and she had even given him some money for travel. The old woman may have been mistaken, but every summer, there are indeed countless so-called travelers who travel all over Norway, spending no money, having nothing on them, and carrying a camera with them at all times. They are treated well by the farmers along the way. These people are now revisiting the old place, but their clothes are completely different. It is also said that many so-called "Vienna children" are among the German troops invading Norway. These Germans were young when World War I ended and food was scarce, so they were taken in and raised by Norwegians to regain their health, and then sent back to their homeland. Now the Germans are repaying kindness with ingratitude, and at least they have made Norwegians disbelieve that there is any commonality between the two nations.

At dusk, we returned to the farm and saw that the national army had been forced to retreat again and again, but from the conversation of the officers and soldiers, we could see that they were not discouraged at all. The host provided dinner and lodging. These officers and soldiers spoke politely and behaved modestly, but they lacked better armaments, had not received rigorous training, lacked combat experience, and were only equipped with rifles and a few machine guns and small cannons. They could not resist the German planes and tanks for long.

We then said goodbye to the farmer and squeezed into the car again, driving through the night through the extremely destroyed DombÃ¥s and Lesja. There were many bomb craters along the way. At this point, the scenery of western Norway gradually appeared, with narrow valleys and a rushing stream in the middle. The mountain slopes on both sides were steep, and between the towering peaks, the sky was dark blue. The single-track railway and highway were both very narrow. In many places, it was difficult for two cars to pass each other. Bullet marks were everywhere along the road. At dawn, we drove through the blazing fire of Ãndalsnes. Leaving the valley and approaching the bay, the scenery was full of spring. The mountain streams swelled to the banks. The grass was as green as jade. Soldiers wore white peonies on their chests, as all the flowers were in full bloom.

Arriving at Isfjorden, we stayed at a home for several days. The farmers continued to plow the fields. Airplanes often soared in the clear sky behind the mountains, and dots of white smoke showed that the anti-aircraft guns in Ãndalsnes were still firing. From time to time, bullets flew from that direction, whistling through the air. We would dive to the ground to avoid them, but most of them fell into the fields, so the residents of Isfjorden remained calm as always.

After four days, we learned in the evening that the British army in southern Norway had retreated on royal ships from Ãndalsnes, and the German army was approaching Tresfjord directly. We had no choice but to flee to another place again. The farmer offered us food and lodging, entertained us diligently, and refused to accept any payment. He even shook our hands happily, encouraging us to meet again in the future, but his wife hugged us goodbye with tears in her eyes.

As the sun set and dusk fell, a small fishing boat quietly approached the shore. We then boarded the boat together and sailed towards the black smoke. That place was Molde. The boat was carrying medical supplies, which were delivered to the hospital after arriving in Molde. We also disembarked and entered the hospital, and then with the help of others, we got a car and drove on at full speed. We passed through the ruins of Molde, climbed mountains and crossed ridges, and then along the bay to Bud. The port is located at the tip of Romsdalsfjord in Norway, extending into the North Sea with rolling hills and dense bushes. Even when the wind is calm and the waves are still, seawater strikes the rocks, and the spray flies high, surging endlessly.

We then boarded a boat again near the small bay of Hustadvika and headed north. There were 36 people on board, mostly women and children, with only six beds. A well-known Norwegian political commentator, who was very radical, was also on board. He suffered from gout and could hardly move. His children attended to him, taking care of him carefully, and his wife volunteered to serve as a maid. There were also several soldiers on the boat, who had hurriedly escaped after hearing that the national army had surrendered. They boarded the boat and headed north, planning to contact the remnants of the national army so that they could continue fighting.

We traveled by day and hid by night. During the day, the sea was as calm as a mirror, and in the evening, the setting sun reflected the red light in all directions. A soldier lent me a sleeping bag, and I lay on the deck. Although it was hard and uncomfortable, it was still peaceful and had a unique flavor. The gout sufferer also lay on the deck, which must have been even more difficult, but he did not complain at all. Moreover, his conversation was very humorous, which relieved the loneliness a lot. The boat passed the mouth of the Trondheim Fjord, which was occupied by the German army, which was quite nerve-wracking. It was rumored that the German army had detained many fishing boats and was patrolling around the mouth of the fjord. When we approached the Trondheim Fjord, we avoided it far away and went around the sea. Airplanes flew over from time to time, but they did not notice us.

The boat traveled between the coastal mountains and the islands offshore. An oncoming boat told us that few civilians had landed in BodÃ¸. Further north, there were dense water mines on both sides of the Vestfjord, and we might have to go around the Lofoten Islands. But if we could change boats and return to Mo i Rana and go east to Sweden, we would have hope of getting help. At that time, the professor and I were running out of money, and we hoped to get help if we went to Sweden, so we decided to change boats and return to Mo.

The last part of the journey from there to crossing the border into Sweden was the most difficult. We set off from Mo in a truck, going up a rugged mountain road. The snow had just melted, and the road was full of mud, and it was very bumpy. The bumps were even worse at the turning points under the cliffs. We jumped high and swayed from side to side in the car. From time to time, the wheels fell into the ice, and we had to get out of the car and push hard for several hours before we could move again. Therefore, we only traveled twelve li on the first night. The gout sufferer was also in the car, and it is not difficult to imagine his suffering from these bumps. That night, we stayed in a thatched hut on the hillside. The host entertained us diligently, and the road workers crowded into a room. When they saw us, they got up and gave up their beds. At four o'clock in the afternoon the next day, we walked on foot, and the patient was carried on a stretcher by his son and the host of the thatched hut. Then we got back into the car and drove forward. The mountain road was still rugged and difficult to travel, and we finally reached six li from the Norwegian border, where we had to ski over the mountain.

It had been more than 20 years since I had skied, but the leather clothes I was wearing were not suitable for skiing, so the patient and I each rode on a sled, which was pushed slowly by six young men, and we finally reached the border post. Most of us stayed there to rest, but the young men who pushed the sleds had to return to their starting point so that they could work the next day. I, the patient, and his children continued to move forward. As the east turned white, we rode on a sled across the lakes and marshes that bordered Sweden and Norway. The lake surface had already started to thaw, and the people pushing the sleds sometimes stepped into the water, which was knee-deep, causing water to fly high around the sleds.

When we first met the Swedish border guards, a ray of golden sunlight had already shone on the Norwegian mountains. There was no more snow on the road. The patient's daughter insisted on carrying my suitcase for me, and I couldn't refuse. After walking about three kilometers to the guard station, the station was crowded with people, so we continued on. However, remembering that we could not use the sled, we used the stretcher to carry the patient again, and his daughter and I walked on foot.

We heard that there was an inn one kilometer away, with only a few road workers living there, but we walked two or three kilometers without encountering a small house. It was five o'clock in the morning, and when we pushed open the door and entered the house, it felt even colder than outside. There was a stove in the room, and beds were lined up against the wall, covered with straw and dead leaves. There was only one bed, and a man was sleeping soundly in it. He had not woken up when we took fire for warmth.

When the patient was carried on a stretcher to the small house, the man woke up in surprise, staring blankly, thinking that the injured person had been carried on a stretcher, so he shouted, "Has the war really come?" We hurriedly explained to him, and he put on his pants and socks and got out of bed, cooked coffee, and brought out cheese and other things to entertain us. We were treated well everywhere we went, but no one was more kind and sincere, and earnestly urged us to eat, than this Swedish road worker. After fourteen hours of arduous trekking, we were entertained by him, and we felt cheerful and invigorated.

That afternoon, the professor and others also crossed the border into Sweden. We were then taken care of by the Swedish military authorities, and stayed in a hotel to clean up. The next day, we had our hair cut. At the hotel, we heard that the German army had invaded the Netherlands and Belgium. I then arrived in Stockholm, Sweden, and received news from Norway, learning that my family was safe, but my eldest son had died in battle on April 27.

### Citywide Silent Commemoration Today: Third Anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai
### Preparations Reach the Most Serious Stage
### British Troops On Farewell Duty, Performing Their Duties to the Utmost
### Inspections Are Especially Thorough, Businesses Close Early

Today marks the solemn and passionate third anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai. Given the special circumstances of Shanghai, all sectors are holding commemorations that are practical rather than formal. All entertainment venues are temporarily closed, all Chinese radio stations are suspending entertainment programs, and citizens are voluntarily observing a day of vegetarianism to mourn the fallen soldiers and martyred compatriots. All sectors regard the Battle of Shanghai as the beginning of the sacred national self-defense war. Over the past three years, this belief has strengthened, and the determination is to expand the donation drive for disaster relief and the collection of winter clothing to fulfill national responsibilities. All public organizations are today sending telegrams to the supreme leader and all the soldiers fighting the war to express their respect and condolences. The entire citizenry will stand in silence at noon, each in their original position, to commemorate the fallen.

Serious Preparations Reach a Peak

Yesterday, the preparations in the two concessions entered the most serious stage. The authorities of the two concessions doubled their efforts and strictly enforced the preparations. Yesterday passed peacefully again. A police spokesman said that yesterday was quiet throughout the day, and the curfew was enforced even more strictly. Even those with passes were fined if they abused them without a legitimate reason. British defense forces also maintained their posts as usual, seemingly for their last mobilization before departure. Public venues will close early at the request of the police. These special preparations are scheduled to be completely lifted at 8:00 AM on the 14th of this month, but will be decided based on the situation at that time. Yesterday, police officers, special constables, and French volunteer forces were all deployed, reinforcing key road intersections and conducting strict inspections of vehicles and pedestrians. Patrol teams were formed to patrol the concessions. Red police vehicles in the Public Concession and armored vehicles in the French Concession were also fully deployed yesterday, inspecting defense arrangements at any time and maintaining communication between the military and police. A large number of detectives in the two concessions were also very active, investigating suspicious locations and pedestrians to prevent petty criminals from operating. In addition, the curfew was strictly enforced, and all entertainment venues were ordered to close before 11:30 PM. Many people have been detained by the police in the concessions in recent days for violating the curfew.

Military and Police Everywhere, Traffic Interrupted

After being ordered to mobilize, the defense forces of various countries stationed in the port have been increasing the number of personnel deployed daily. By yesterday, all had been mobilized. In addition to densely deploying key areas in their respective defense zones and strictly protecting them, they also dispatched patrols with guns. Although the British defense forces have decided to withdraw, they are still fulfilling their responsibilities before withdrawing. Yesterday, from Avenue Edward VII and Yuqiaqing Road to the Bund area, British defense forces patrolled in teams of twelve, maintaining high spirits. In addition, the cavalry, the Combined Regiment, and Company B of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps were all deployed yesterday. Company A is scheduled to be mobilized today. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps, deployed yesterday, patrolled in police vehicles and on foot, assisting concession police in maintaining order. The sandbag fortifications erected in front of the newspaper offices on Hankou Road, Avenue Edward VII, the Bund, and Jiujiang Road were each guarded by five members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, equipped with machine guns. Road closures were more strictly enforced yesterday. The two sets of barbed wire originally placed at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Route BÃ©thune were connected with hemp rope yesterday, completely blocking the road. Except for Public Bus Route 22, no other pedestrians or vehicles were allowed to pass. The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception on Avenue Edward VII, Rue du PÃ¨re Huc, the Great Bell, and Rue Massenet, which were open during the day, were closed after 7:00 PM. In addition to the Waterworks Bridge and the Pont de Consolation, which have been sealed off, other bridges can still be used, but military and police are heavily deployed and inspections are strict. In addition, each pier on the Bund is guarded by five or six members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and police. Citizens landing are searched. The iron gates between the French Concession and the municipal area were still open as usual yesterday, but may be closed today. However, French troops and police have also increased.

Tense Atmosphere North of the Suzhou Creek

The atmosphere in the area north of the Suzhou Creek, where British and Japanese defense forces are stationed, was also tense yesterday. British troops constructed a sandbag fortification at the intersection of Henan Road and Tiantong Road, guarded by ten British soldiers, facing the Japanese-expanded defense zone from afar. One British soldier was still stationed at the intersection of Haining Road, but the number of British soldiers at the end of North Henan Road had increased to two. Five or six British soldiers entered the fortress there yesterday. Two Japanese soldiers still stood guard in sentry boxes at the intersections of Henan Road and North Suzhou Road, Tiantong Road, Haining Road, and Bazi Road, holding guns, but pedestrians were not obstructed. The martial law at the iron gates was also tightened. The iron gate on Kaifeng Road remained closed, and the number of British guards had increased to two. The iron gate at the end of North Henan Road was still open, but the number of Japanese soldiers guarding the outside of the concession had increased from one to two, and a sentry box had been added. The number of Chinese police officers inside the concession had also increased to seven or eight, and a sentry box had also been added yesterday to strictly inspect pedestrians entering and exiting.

The Badlands West of Shanghai Resemble a Blockade

The area of the badlands west of Shanghai was already under a blockade yesterday. The situation at the triangular area at the intersection of Great Western Road and Avenue Haig was extremely tense. A large number of Italian soldiers and Chinese and Western detectives were stationed at the barbed wire blockade, strictly inspecting passing pedestrians. Vehicles were also not allowed to pass. A large number of military and police were also deployed at the barbed wire at the intersections of Jiaozhou Road and Xinzha Road, Rue Robert and Route Tenant de la Tour, and Connaught Road and Yanping Road. In the Zhaojia Du area, only a few puppet police were seen at their posts, directing traffic. Armed Japanese military police were patrolling in formation in the areas where roads were being built beyond the borders.

Strict Precautions in Hongkou and Zhabei

The Japanese preparations in Hongkou and Zhabei were extremely strict yesterday. Japanese military police and Japanese consulate police were all deployed, stationed in various places. Japanese soldiers with loaded guns patrolled back and forth in the area around North Sichuan Road and Broadway Road. The Japanese Sanpu military police commander specifically prohibited Chinese from approaching the Gonghexiang Wharf, and precautions were extremely tight nearby. All bridges in Zhabei leading to the concessions were guarded by Japanese soldiers and puppet police yesterday. Armed Japanese soldiers were also stationed next to the abandoned fortress on Xinmin Road and Datong Road, and unarmed puppet police were stationed in various places. Because of their special circumstances, the residents there all stayed home and silently commemorated the day. The precautions at the wharves in Yangshupu were even tighter, and passengers and crew members were severely searched when boarding and disembarking, creating a very tense atmosphere.

The Huangpu River is Blocked, Bridges Interrupted

The Customs Water Police Station will also be stepping up precautions today, and it is reported that the Japanese Navy will also specially block all wharves and ports on the Huangpu River today, such as the downstream of the Huangpu River, prohibiting any ships from entering or exiting. In the area of the eastern section of the Suzhou Creek, ships will be prohibited from traveling. All inland river ships will be temporarily suspended for one day. Bridges over the Suzhou Creek that are not necessary will be blocked with barbed wire.

### The Huangpu Conservancy Bureau is Forced to Reorganize, Japanese Personnel Arrive at the Bureau
### No Changes to Other Personnel
### Water Accumulation is Attributed to Gutter Blockage

Since the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau was forced to reorganize and the Japanese Fujisawa was appointed as the chief engineer, the Japanese employee and a Japanese secretary arrived at the bureau and the bureau opened another room on the fifth floor of the Jianghai Customs for them to work. As for the other personnel in each department, they continue to work as usual and there are no changes. Regarding the dredging work, the scale of the current projects is very small, far less than one-tenth of what it was before the war. The biggest reason is that most of the dredgers are still being held, and even the Jianshe, which is docked in the Huangpu River, has not been fully restored to freedom. Therefore, the ship has been stranded in the Huangpu River and has not moved a step. It is said that the ship will join the dredging project, but it is not reliable. The bureau is paying close attention to the autumn tide in the Huangpu River, but it points out that the accumulation of water on the roads is due to the blockage of the sewers, which has little to do with the high tide. The accumulation of water on the roads in Shanghai all occurs after heavy rains, which is very obvious.

### French Post Ship Xi Jiang will Sail Directly to Haiphong

According to company sources, the Xi Jiang, the first French ship of the French Post Ship Company to resume shipping services from Shanghai to Haiphong, is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 16th of this month and will load passengers and cargo in Shanghai around the 18th before sailing directly to Haiphong. Therefore, tickets for the ship have been on sale since yesterday.

### Band Conductor Arrives, US Navy Hosts Banquet

Leihof, the conductor of the band of the 4th Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai, recently received orders to come to Shanghai. The officers of the Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai hosted a banquet for Conductor Leihof at noon on the 11th to welcome him. During the banquet, the team's new chaplain, Mr. Quipping, gave a speech to welcome him. Conductor Leihof was recently transferred to Shanghai from San Diego, USA. In the past, he worked in the California San Diego detachment of the US Navy, specializing in music affairs. His arrival is to expand the musical training of naval officers.

### Consular Body's Reply to the Municipal Council has been Officially Delivered Yesterday
### Consular Body Has Not Disclosed the Contents of the Reply
### It is Rumored that New Restrictions Will be Announced Soon

On the 22nd of last month, Chairman Keim of the Municipal Council made an earnest appeal to the consular body for cooperation, due to the frequent occurrence of terrorist incidents and political assassinations in the concessions, in order to maintain order in the concessions. After two meetings and discussions, the consular body formally submitted a reply to the Municipal Council yesterday (the 12th), according to Mr. Hill, the leader of the consular body in the port. However, Mr. Hill refused to disclose the contents of the reply. It is said that all the consuls general of various countries do not want to disclose the contents of the reply. It is generally expected that after receiving the consular body's reply on curbing terrorist incidents, the Municipal Council may announce new restrictions after the third anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai commemorations, scheduled for the 14th of this month, come to an end.

Citizens Eagerly Hope to Curb Crime

The consular body of the Public Concession has met to discuss curbing terrorist activities within the concession, but no formal resolutions have been announced, and armed crime continues to be rampant. Several unfortunate incidents have even occurred continuously at the same time, leaving law-abiding citizens without protection. All parties still hope that the Municipal Council will quickly adopt effective measures to curb these activities. Chairman Keim's plea is enthusiastically supported by every law-abiding citizen in the concession, and it is obvious that crimes such as kidnapping are carefully hidden. Taxis for business trips are often exploited. The public hopes that the authorities will strengthen police forces in border areas and strictly enforce inspections to curb these activities.

### Commanders of Various Countries' Defense Forces To Meet Tomorrow to Discuss Adjustments to Defense Area Responsibilities; Definite Date for British Troops' Departure Not Yet Decided

The English-language "Evening Star" reports that according to reliable sources, the commanders of the defense forces of various countries in Shanghai are expected to hold a meeting on Wednesday (i.e., tomorrow) to discuss adjustments to the responsibilities of various defense areas in the Public Concession after the withdrawal of British troops. This meeting may be convened by Rear Admiral Takeda, commander of the Shanghai Japanese Naval Landing Force, and senior commanders of foreign defense forces. Takeda previously convened a meeting of defense force commanders from various countries in February of this year. According to well-informed sources, it is expected that the British troops will begin their actual departure from Shanghai after the special precautionary measures taken for the anniversary of the August 13th Shanghai Battle end on Thursday.

West Hongkou District: Russian Unit to Take Over

It is widely believed that the West Hongkou defense area, currently defended by British troops from the Highland Light Infantry, will be handed over to the Russian unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps on Thursday. Regarding the meeting of defense force commanders, no official news is available today. However, well-informed sources say that in view of the imminent departure of British troops, such a meeting is indeed necessary, especially since at the previous meeting in February, various countries had already discussed measures to respond to any changes that might arise due to the European war in the city.

Rumors Unfounded

The "Shanghai Times" reports that the British government's announcement last Friday of the withdrawal of British troops stationed in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Peiping has caused surprise among the British community and Chinese and foreign citizens alike. However, the general consensus is that the British government's decision is reasonable and appropriate, as the British Empire is currently engaged in the most serious war in its history. However, it goes without saying that the impending withdrawal of the Highland Light Infantry and the East Surrey Regiment involves many important issues. The general public is quite concerned about this, and some have expressed disappointment. However, there is no reason for reckless criticism or widespread rumors.

British Troops' Departure Date Not Yet Set

As for when the British troops in the city will depart or where they will go, there is still no news. However, British military commanders hope to "go to war" or at least be sent to a place where they can play a more useful role in defending the British Empire. It is reported that both the Highland Light Infantry and the East Surrey Regiment welcome the government's decision. At the same time, responsible sources say that all British troops stationed in Shanghai are currently actively patrolling and assisting in maintaining order. Therefore, they have not yet begun preparations for withdrawal, nor have they received orders to return equipment or relax routine defense work.

Rumor of Meeting: Already Held Yesterday

The British withdrawal is purely to strengthen the defenses of British colonies in the Far East, such as Hong Kong and Singapore. According to the British Embassy's Information Office, "Although the British government has not announced its attitude toward its interests in China, we firmly believe that Britain will not abandon its vast interests." Authoritative sources believe that the British defense forces, which protect these interests, would not allow another defense force to take over that conflicts with their interests. Regarding the date of the meeting, the English-language "Evening Star" reported yesterday that, according to unconfirmed reports, it would be held on Wednesday. However, when a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency inquired at the Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office, the reporter was told, also based on unconfirmed reports, that the meeting had already been held yesterday (Monday). However, the British Embassy's Information Office and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps both declined to disclose the content and agenda of the meeting.

### Japanese Planes Raid Ningbo South Gate; Low-Altitude Strafing; Japanese Warships at Zhenhai Fire Six Shots

Reports previously received from the shipping industry in Ningbo indicate that Ningbo had four air raid alerts the day before yesterday. The first alert was at 6:26 AM when three Japanese planes were spotted over Longshan. The planes then passed through Zhenhai and entered Ningbo's airspace, flying very low.

Machine Gun Strafing

They strafed with machine guns outside Ningbo's South Gate, but there were no casualties. The planes then flew toward Linhai, Ninghai, and disappeared. The second alert was at 8:20 AM when three Japanese planes were spotted near Yiwu, circling over Zhuji for a long time before heading toward Shaoxing. The third alert was when a Japanese plane was spotted over Songmen at the same time, also heading toward Shaoxing via Xianju and Shengxian. The fourth alert was when three Japanese planes were again spotted over Songmen, then observed Xiangshan, Shibu, and Jiangshan in the southern suburbs of Ningbo, before heading out to sea from Zhenhai.

Japanese Warships Open Fire

Yesterday morning at 7:18 AM, a Japanese warship anchored off the coast of Shibu sailed away at 7:10 AM, its destination unknown. A Japanese warship outside the Zhenhai harbor fired six shots blindly toward the southern bank of the Yangtze River. The shells landed in the wilderness, so there was no damage. A Japanese warship anchored off the coast of Longshan suddenly fired three shots to the northeast. At 9:15 AM, a Japanese warship off the coast of Hengshan sailed toward the waters of Dongqimen, constantly patrolling, before anchoring off the coast of Qijiao without further movement.

### Mediation of Shanghai Power Company Labor Dispute Still Unsuccessful; Company Satisfied with Foreign Employees' Abilities

The English-language "Evening Star" reports that Mr. Catto, chairman of the British-owned Shanghai Power Company, stated this morning (the 12th) that there has been no change in the company's strike, which has lasted for four weeks. Efforts to reach a resolution have so far been unsuccessful. However, the White Russian and German Jewish refugees temporarily employed at the company's Yangshupu plant have been able to continue to provide electricity as usual, and their output has even increased compared to before the strike. Mr. Catto was unable to say when the labor dispute could be resolved. He also declined to comment on rumors that if the labor dispute is not resolved by the end of this week, the temporarily employed foreigners will be permanently employed. It is reported that hundreds of Chinese have applied for employment with the Shanghai Power Company, and some of their applications may be accepted by the company for permanent employment.

### Salvage Society Convent Fundraising to Commemorate Clement Mumme

Some members of the Salvage Society Convent have recently launched a fundraising campaign to allocate funds to the Salvage Society Convent in memory of the late head of the convent, Clement Mumme. They are asking all members of the convent to donate generously and jointly support this effort. The amount of funds raised will be announced later. Donations can be sent to the following locations: (1) Mrs. Mamie Martins Buckly, c/o Shanghai Telephone Company, 232 Jiangxi Road; (2) Mrs. Natalia Morgado Lopes, c/o Kiousin Dock, 9 Bund, French Concession; (3) Mrs. Cathleen Landen Sampson, Room 42, Lane 7, 1220 Avenue Haig; (4) Miss Lola d'Almeida, Room 301, 455 Route Lafayette; (5) Miss Marguerite Diniz, Room 409, 97 Route Ghisi; (6) Miss Laura Gutterres, c/o D. B. Sparks, 12 Bund.

### First Time Chinese Nationals Allowed to go to Mexico; Annual Limit of One Hundred; Old Nationals Returning to Mexico will be Handled Flexibly

Tan Shaohua, our country's envoy to Mexico, has negotiated with the Mexican government a plan for Chinese nationals to return to Mexico this year. Relevant parties in this city have received it one after another. It has detailed regulations regarding the entry of new nationals and the procedures for old nationals to return to Mexico. It has been found that the Mexican Ministry of Interior has published an order in the Mexican government gazette regarding the annual quota of foreigners allowed to enter Mexico in 1940. The number of new Chinese nationals allowed to enter is one hundred. Furthermore, according to the regulations of the order, old Chinese nationals who do not have the right to return to Mexico may also be allowed to return to Mexico under various circumstances, such as having property or business.

### Refugee Factory in Five Counties Selling "Golden Pagoda" Brand Products

The refugee factory of the five counties of Changzhou, Danyang, Jintan, Lishui, and Yangzhong, located at 459 Changping Road, has trained no less than a hundred skilled refugees. The Zhenjiang International Relief Committee has sent twenty refugees from Zhenjiang, who are still being trained.

### Extension of Low-Priced Rice Sale; Police Should Rest After Precautionary Measures; Shanghai Municipal Council Instructs Implementation from 20th

The fifth phase of the low-priced broken rice sale was originally scheduled to begin on the 15th of this month. The Shanghai Low-Priced Rice Committee received temporary notice yesterday afternoon from Mr. Dequey, Deputy Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Council, that since August 15th had just passed the third anniversary of the Shanghai Battle (August 13th), all police officers were bound to be exhausted during this period of strict precautionary measures, and the fifth phase of the low-priced rice sale should be postponed to the 20th of this month. The Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the authorities, decided to postpone the sale to that date.

No Change in Measures

The Committee decided to continue to hold the fifth phase of the low-priced rice sale from 7:00 AM on August 20th, in accordance with the previous measures. It will still entrust 60 rice shops in the two concessions, designated by the Rice Merchants Association, to handle the low-priced rice sale. Among them, 36 are in the Public Concession, with 18 selling tickets and 18 distributing rice, and 24 are in the French Concession, with 12 selling tickets and 12 distributing rice. The Rice Merchants Association has designated these shops separately. Those who purchase rice on time must strictly observe order and must not rush or push. It will also send separate letters to the authorities of the two concessions, instructing them to send personnel to protect the premises in order to prevent unruly citizens from causing disturbances at the scene.

Four Jin Per Yuan

The Shanghai Low-Priced Rice Committee has currently stipulated the following five measures for this low-priced rice sale: (1) It is stipulated that each person is limited to purchasing rice with Shanghai common legal tender of one yuan and must not buy more. (2) Each yuan will sell four jin of rice. (3) Each store will still be limited to selling 50 bags of rice per day. (4) Rice distribution time is from 7:00 AM to 10:00 AM every day, and sales will stop at any time after 50 bags have been sold. As for the first batch of 29,000 bags of low-priced broken rice that the Committee ordered from abroad, it arrived at the port at the end of last month. The second batch of 20,000 bags also arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, and a telegram will continue to be sent to order 20,000 bags from abroad.

Price Limit on Foreign Rice

The Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee issued its fifth announcement yesterday, stipulating that the maximum price of foreign rice must not exceed the limit of the 16th of last month. The original text states: "For public announcement, the Committee convened a meeting on the 10th of this month regarding the market price of various foreign rice and decided that the price announced on the 16th of last month will still be the maximum price. Market trading is only allowed below that price and must not exceed the limit. If there are any cases of unofficial deals, etc., once discovered, they will be reported to the authorities of the two concessions for strict punishment. This is hereby reiterated, and it is hoped that everyone will comply. This is extremely important." According to the price limit of the 16th of last month, it is 99.5 yuan for No. 1 Saigon and Siam rice, 59 yuan for Huojiao, 57 yuan for No. 2 Saigon, No. 1 Siam, and Xiaojiao, 54 yuan for Tokyo Jianjian, 50 yuan for Tokyo brown rice, 48 yuan for rice mung bean bags, and 44 yuan for mixed broken rice. The market price of various rice fell as a result yesterday. Today is the third anniversary of the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle, and the market is closed for one day as usual. It will reopen as usual from tomorrow.

### French Concession Police Raid Jin Gu Village

Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, a large contingent of Chinese and foreign police officers from the French Concession Police Department raided Jin Gu Village on Father Jin Road and Avenue Edward VII. They conducted a thorough, house-by-house search, which lasted for about an hour.  However, nothing was found.

Central Police Station: No Bomb Found, Only a Small Can of Gunpowder and Magnet Exploded During Garbage Disposal

According to the "North-China Daily News", amidst heightened security by public concession and French concession military police and merchants yesterday (the 11th), a rumor suddenly spread that a hand grenade had exploded inside the Central Police Station on Fuzhou Road, injuring a coolie from the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council. This caused considerable alarm. It was rumored that the hand grenade had been placed in a trash can by a Chinese person detained in the police station during curfew. Another version said there were five bombs in the trash can, and the coolie sustained multiple injuries. However, investigations have revealed that these rumors are unfounded. The only explosion that did occur at the Central Police Station yesterday morning at 6:20 AM. According to police investigation, a Chinese servant in the Chief Inspector's office, while cleaning the firearms inspection section on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, found a paper bag and poured the garbage from the bag into a trash can inside the Central Police Station. He was unaware that there was a small can containing gunpowder and a magnet in the garbage. Yesterday morning, when a coolie from the Public Works Department was cleaning the garbage, he saw the small can and casually threw it aside, causing it to explode. The coolie sustained injuries to his right knee and ankle and was immediately taken to Renji Hospital.  His injuries were not severe, and he was discharged after being bandaged.

The Police Department Intensifies Enforcement of Curfew: Many people were detained on the streets and taken to various police stations after 12:30 AM. Patrolmen with the head of the Chinese confronted and questioned them. The situation in the French Concession was also calm.  The French Police Department, in cooperation with the Japanese, searched several locations within the concession, but made no arrests.

Waltz-Out Lease of the Great Shanghai Ballroom: Fraudulent Incident Occurs, Original Owner Obtains Lease Renewal, Xia Yanqing Detained for Fraudulent "Campaign Expenses"

The lease for the Great Shanghai Ballroom on the fifth floor of the Great Shanghai Company on Yu Qiaqing Road was originally due to expire at the end of May this year. Because the ballroom's business was good and it had an annual surplus, some people tried to exploit this opportunity by scheming to take over the lease from the Great Shanghai authorities. However, all such schemes failed, and the original lessee, the Great Shanghai Ballroom, continued to obtain the lease renewal. Before the renewal of the Great Shanghai Ballroom's lease was settled, an incident of fraudulent acquisition occurred. A Cantonese man named Liang Jianming, currently residing in Room 10 of the Paramount Hotel, was one of those who had tried to take over the lease of the ballroom. While he was conducting negotiations, a Ningbo native named Xia Yanqing (46 years old, residing at No. 24 Xie Xing Lane, Kaifeng Road; formerly a manager at Jinlong Tobacco Company and a comprador for Taikoo's Chunzhou and Yihua Yusheng ships) claimed to be acting on behalf of Lu Shaoqin, the manager designated by the future owner of the Great Shanghai Ballroom Liang Jianming (currently the chief inspector of Green Field Garden). He planned to recruit tea servers and a head server in preparation for the takeover. When the unemployed heard this good news, they flocked to him. At that time, Xia immediately stated that those seeking positions, the head server would have to pay 50 yuan in "campaign expenses," and the tea servers would have to pay 25 yuan. Ding Yushan, Yu Liansheng, and others raised 1,200 yuan and gave it to Xia as "campaign expenses." Later, Ding and others learned that the contract for the Great Shanghai Ballroom would be continued, so they questioned Xia about what was going on. Xia was evasive, so Ding and others reported the matter to the Zhabei Police Station the other day. The Chinese detective Zhang Bingchun arrested Xia. Yesterday morning, he was taken to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Xia Yanqing was defended by lawyers Gang Yu Enliang, while the police station's lawyer Fang Fushu prosecuted him for fraud. The Great Shanghai Ballroom also sent a representative, Zhu Zigu, to the court. According to the defendant Xia Yanqing, it was a fact that he received 1,200 yuan from the plaintiffs, but he claimed that this money had been used to entertain Liang Jianming and Lu Shaoqin. After questioning by Judge Zhong Qing, he ordered that Xia be remanded in custody for one week for further examination.

Misjudging Friends, Embezzling Large Sums of Money, Ultimately Losing Everything in Gambling Dens, Attempted Suicide in a Locked Room, Shop Owner Unwilling to Pursue the Matter

Hua Hongmei, a 24-year-old Ningbo native and employee of the Hongchang Tobacco Shop at No. 6 Yong'an Lane, Yong'an Street, repeatedly took advantage of his position between May 17th and July 31st to embezzle over 10,000 yuan from the shop's funds, spending it all in gambling dens. Unable to make amends, he locked himself in a room and attempted suicide by purchasing poison. Before taking the poison, he wrote two suicide notes, one sent to the tobacco shop and the other to his parents, explaining the whole suicide. Fortunately, a tea server saw him crying bitterly and, sensing something was wrong, quickly reported it to the accounting department, which notified the police station. Officers were dispatched to investigate and took Hua back to the police station for questioning. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for trial according to the law. The defendant admitted that he had misjudged his friends and was lured into gambling dens, losing a large sum of money, which was true. The plaintiff, Ye Shouting, the manager of Hongchang Tobacco Shop, stated that he asked the judge to spare the young defendant from punishment. "He really cannot die. He has parents above him and a wife below him. If he really dies from poison, I will not be able to face his parents. Now I would rather give up and not pursue the matter." After verifying the facts, the court instructed the defendant to be remanded in custody for further verification at a later date.

Son of "King of Manure" Ma Honggen Accused of Excavating Graves, Incorrect Jurisdiction, Transferred to the First Special District Court

Ma Honggen (40 years old, local), son of "King of Manure" A Gui Jie, residing at No. 200 Avenue PÃ¨re Froc, was recently sued by Gu Agen (61 years old, local, residing at No. 380 Tokyo Road). She hired lawyer Shen Yong to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing him of excavating graves, violating Article 248 of the Criminal Code. Based on the complaint, the court held a hearing in the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Zhang Minsheng.

According to the plaintiff's claim, Ma Fuqi, the defendant's father, purchased from the plaintiff and the plaintiff's sister-in-law, Gu Zhu, in the thirteenth year of the Republic [1924], 3.51 hao of tiantian fields in the Dongsheng Ziwei of the 27th Bao in the South and 12th Tu of Shangyi, priced at 1,404 yuan. However, because there were two ancestral graves on the land, it was stipulated that 200 yuan would be deducted from the land price until the graves were relocated. Unexpectedly, Ma Fuqi passed away soon after purchasing the land. The defendant inherited all the property. The defendant neither used the land nor urged the plaintiff to relocate the graves. Therefore, the plaintiff went to sweep the graves every year as usual, and all went well until this year's Qingming Festival, when it was discovered that the graves had been excavated and removed without a trace, and the land was under construction. When the plaintiff negotiated with the defendant, he ignored the matter and refused to return the coffins, remains, or hair. The defendant is the owner of the land and cannot shirk responsibility for anything concerning the land. Regarding the excavation and removal of the graves, the defendant should at least be held responsible for instigating the act. The plaintiff asks the court to punish the defendant accordingly and order the return of the excavated coffins, remains, or hair to the plaintiff. When questioned, the defendant Ma Honggen denied any knowledge of the matter. The court held that the land in question was located on Binlang Road in the Public Concession, so the jurisdiction was incorrect. It ordered the case to be transferred to the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Court for handling.

Social Miscellany

Kang Linxian, the owner of the Kang Lin Ji underwear store at No. 119 Weihaiwei Road, handed over several hundred pieces of clothing worth 2,596 yuan to Chi Jinchun for sale on July 26th and August 1st. Unexpectedly, Chi embezzled all the clothing and fled without a trace. The other day, a Shaoxing native named Wu Yongqing, residing at No. 26 Yongyu Lane, Caishi Road in the French Concession, brought 120 pieces of clothing to Wu Yimin at No. 160 Dagu Road, offering to sell them for 2.10 yuan per piece. After Wu realized that the clothing was the same stolen from Kang Lin Ji, he reported it to Kang, who then reported it to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Detectives were dispatched to arrest Wu, while the thief is on the run. Yesterday morning, Wu was taken to the First Special District Court for further questioning.

Lin Chang, a Guangdong waiter at the Wei Ya Restaurant at No. 755 Nanjing Road, got into an argument with his colleague Xu Shenggen in the restaurant last night and accidentally pushed Xu, causing him to fall and die. After reporting the incident, the police detained Lin. Yesterday morning, he was taken to the First Special District Court to request detention. The defendant's lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang defended him. According to Lin Chang, he had no hatred for the deceased. "Last night, I was sleeping in the restaurant when the deceased joked and poured cold water into my nostrils. I got up to chase him, but he lost his balance and fell to his death. I really didn't hit him." After verifying the facts, the court ordered that the defendant be remanded in custody pending an autopsy report.

Gu Liqi, the head of the Chinese Reserve Police Team at the Xinzha Police Station, led Chinese police officers to raid a large gambling den at Nos. 64-66 Qiahe Lane, No. 1019 Chengdu Road, at 9:40 PM the other night. The gambling boss, Gu Zhenhuan, was arrested on the spot, along with dozens of gamblers. A large amount of gambling money and equipment was confiscated. Yesterday morning, they were taken to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court and punished according to the law. The evidence was confiscated.

Education News

19,000 People Took the Unified Entrance Examination for Public Institutions This Year, Except for Shanghai and Tunxi, All Used Test Questions Issued by the Ministry of Education

(Chongqing, 12th) The unified entrance examination for public institutions this year was held from July 20th to 23rd in sixteen districts and seventeen locations simultaneously. However, due to the special circumstances in the Shanghai district, alternative measures were determined separately. Various institutions in Shanghai held their own examinations on the specified dates and recruited students on behalf of institutions in various other locations. The Hong Kong branch once considered suspending enrollment due to the tense situation in Hong Kong. Later, the situation eased temporarily, and the examinations were held as usual. All districts and branches, except for the Shanghai district and Tunxi branch, used the unified test questions issued by the Ministry of Education. The examinations proceeded smoothly. Currently, the enrollment committees in various districts are rushing to grade the examination papers. The results from the districts that have been examined have already been sent to Chongqing. The Unified Enrollment Committee of Public Institutions of the Ministry of Education has begun to review the results. This should be completed by the end of this month. The number of applicants reported by various districts and branches has reached 17,949, according to those that have been reported to the Ministry. Combining the number of applicants in districts and branches that have not yet reported, the total should be in the range of 19,000. Compared to the number of applicants last year, there is no increase. This is due to the stricter restrictions on applicants with equivalent academic qualifications and the fact that students from normal schools who have not completed their service period are not allowed to apply. However, the number of high school graduates participating in the examination has not decreased. As for the matter of exempting outstanding high school graduation examination students and university preparatory students from examinations for admission, the Ministry of Education has separately issued recommended methods and ordered the education departments of various provinces and the colleges and universities to handle the matter in accordance with the regulations.

Various Charitable Organizations in Hong Kong Establish Free Schools to Take in Poor Children, More Than Thirty Free Schools Newly Established in July

(Hong Kong Correspondence) After the Hong Kong authorities promulgated new regulations on school buildings, the number of students in each class in free schools was reduced as usual, and many poor students were squeezed out. Charitable organizations and enthusiastic educators in Hong Kong have been actively seeking ways to provide relief, such as newly establishing free schools and adding classes, which is called "implementing a two-part system." The details are as follows:

Newly Established Free Schools: In July, more than thirty free schools were newly established by various organizations, and many are still in preparation. (1) The Chungda Civilian Free School, divided between Hong Kong and Kowloon, has established a total of twelve schools, each enrolling forty students, for a total enrollment of five hundred students. The entrance examination has been completed, and classes began on the evening of August 6th. Based on the situation, several more will be opened in densely populated areas. (2) The Cheung Sha Wan Neighborhood Free School has been approved by the Hong Kong government. It has opened eight classes in the street, enrolling three hundred students. Registration begins immediately, and classes will begin on August 23rd. (3) The Student Relief Association Summer Public School has already started classes, with over seventy students. After the summer vacation, it will be converted into a free school and the number of classes will be increased. (4) The Hong Kong and Kowloon Association of Hawkers and Industrialists' Free School for Needy Children has completed registration with the Hong Kong government on August 1st and began enrolling students immediately. The first phase is expected to enroll three hundred students, and classes will begin on September 1st. (5) The Chinese Ministry of Education stipulates that all schools should establish civilian free schools to promote social education. Due to environmental factors, very few schools in Hong Kong comply. However, in light of the large number of unemployed children in Hong Kong who need assistance, student associations in various schools have initiated the establishment of civilian free schools, which are expected to be realized after the start of the next semester.

Adding Classes: Existing free schools are adding classes to accommodate students who have been squeezed out due to class size limits and to enroll out-of-school children. (1) Tung Wah Hospital Free School: The hospital originally had twenty-seven free schools with over a thousand students. It is now decided that the next semester will begin with an additional enrollment of one thousand students. Registration has already begun and will close on the 12th. The selection of new students will be done through a lottery for first-year students, except for second, third, and fourth-year students, who will be tested for proficiency. The lottery is scheduled to take place in front of the hospital hall starting at 9:00 AM on the 18th of this month. (2) The Tenant United Free School, the Xinhui Free School, Xue Juexian Ma Shizeng Fisherman Association, the Confucius Society, the Wuyi Chamber of Commerce Free School, and others are also increasing enrollment, with quotas ranging from fifty to one hundred students, for a total of approximately one thousand students. Those unable to expand class size due to funding constraints are adopting a two-part system. However, the implementation of this method is quite difficult, and only about thirty schools are currently using this system.

### Heavy Selling of Hong Kong Electric Shares, Sudden Loosening of the Sterling-Dollar Exchange Rate in the Informal Market

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged, but the sterling-dollar exchange rate suddenly reversed in the informal market, especially the dollar exchange rate showing a sharp downward trend, while sterling remained flat. This was due to long-term exchange relations, with speculators and Hong Kong Electric bulls selling off their positions. The market inevitably lacked new buyers, and although some foreign firms were accumulating at low prices, the volume was small, and supply still exceeded demand. In the morning, the dollar exchange rate had already hardened to 5.6875 yuan, but continued selling by speculators and Hong Kong Electric caused the price to fall further. The dollar exchange rate dropped to 5.53125 yuan, while sterling remained at 3 shillings 7.1875 pence, which was 0.015625 pence higher than last Saturday for sterling, and the dollar weakened sharply by 0.125 yuan. Sterling futures were stable, while dollar futures weakened further, so they tended to converge with the spot price.

Chinese and Foreign Banks Shift from Buying to Selling

In the early morning, the exchange rate of sterling against the dollar was unchanged, and against Shanghai it was also flat. The dollar was up by slightly more than half a fen against sterling and down by slightly less than 0.16 yuan against Shanghai, and there was no market for francs. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained as before. Banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning: sterling at 3 shillings 6.6875 pence and the dollar at 5.40625 yuan, which was 0.015625 pence higher for sterling and 0.03125 yuan higher for the dollar compared to the closing prices of last Saturday, due to the slight increase in exchange rates. After opening, American banks first sold August dollar futures to Chinese merchants at 5.40625 yuan, after which exporters and speculators all came to sell, and the market became firm. It was estimated that exporters and speculators sold current dollar at 5.4375 yuan to Yuli and other companies, but soon foreign firms suddenly slightly settled their accounts, causing the underlying trend to soften again, presenting a fluctuating state. It was estimated that foreign firms bought August dollar futures from American banks at 5.40625 yuan. HSBC's listed prices were announced and remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was also announced without any increase or decrease. After this, Hong Kong Electric came to sell first, and American banks absorbed August futures at 3 shillings 7.1875 pence, and then sold current dollar at 5.64375 yuan. Moreover, at that time, Chinese banks and overseas Chinese were also selling, and current dollar traded at 5.46875 yuan. At closing, sterling was at 3 shillings 7.1875 pence and the dollar was at 5.4375 yuan, which was 0.015625 pence higher for sterling and 0.0625 yuan lower for the dollar compared to the morning opening.

The Downward Trend in Forward Rates is Even Sharper

In the afternoon, the downward trend in the market intensified, with Chinese merchants, speculators, and Hong Kong Electric all selling heavily, while buyers were scarce. It was estimated that speculators sold August dollar futures to foreign firms at 5.50 yuan, and Hong Kong Electric sold September dollar futures to foreign firms at 5.46875 yuan. Later, foreign firms bought August dollar futures from Yuli also at 5.50 yuan. As a result, at closing, sterling was at 3 shillings 7.1875 pence and the dollar was at 5.53225 yuan. August sterling was on par with the spot price at 5.50 yuan, and September sterling was at 3 shillings 6.6875 pence and the dollar was at 5.46875 yuan, which was 0.015625 pence higher for spot sterling and stable for September, and 0.125 yuan lower for spot dollar and 0.15625 yuan and 0.25 yuan higher respectively for August and September.

### Sellers Emerge One After Another, the Gold Market Turns Down, Market Closed Today

Yesterday's cash gold informal market conditions: Although the downward trend had started, the underlying momentum was still strong, and the market fluctuated in the middle, with relatively active buying and selling. The initial opening was at 5770 yuan, which was slightly lower by 70 yuan compared to the closing price of last weekend. However, before long, gold and silver companies searched and bought aggressively, pushing the price up to 5820 yuan. Subsequently, as gold from Hong Kong flowed into Shanghai and the exchange market was loosening, sellers followed one another. It was estimated that securities firms and banks all came to sell, pushing the price down to 5790 yuan. After this, money exchange businesses covered their short positions, and banks frequently entered the market, so the price rose to 5815 yuan twice. Finally, as the foreign exchange rate hardened, many people closed out their positions that day, and the price fell to 5785 yuan at closing, which was 55 yuan lower than last Saturday. Moreover, today is August 13th, and there is a public agreement to close the market, so the market was specially closed yesterday afternoon due to settlement reasons. There was no shortage of informal market trading outside the market in the afternoon, but the price was softening. This was because there was suddenly news of a conflict between Japan and Russia, and the exchange market was reading hard. It was rumored that the final price had fallen to between 5720 and 5730 yuan, and the transaction volume for half a day was around 2000 taels. Gold jewelry shops listed prices 10 yuan lower, while customs gold and other types remained flat.

Cash Gold Falls by 55 Yuan

From the morning, for each bar (ten taels), the market was initially down by 70 yuan due to a report of exchange rates loosening, and the opening price was pushed down to 5770 yuan by securities firms and gold shops. Fortunately, gold shops frequently came to buy, and banks were also willing to absorb, so it was heard that the exchange market had tightened. Before long, the price recovered by 50 yuan, with gold shops buying 20 taels from banks at 5820 yuan. However, due to the foreign exchange rate returning to a loosening state, the upward trend was actually a false one. A certain bank and securities firm sold off a lot, and many retail investors also sold at that time, so the price fell back to 5790 yuan. After this, there were fewer sellers, and floating investors took advantage of the low prices to buy in. Moreover, a certain gold shop suddenly came to absorb aggressively, and the price once rose to 5825 yuan. At noon, due to the foreign exchange rate remaining hard, there were many sellers at high prices, and cash shops and retail investors sold off one after another. Before closing, the price fell to 5780 yuan, but a certain money exchange business covered its short position, pushing the price back up by 5 yuan to 5785 yuan. (The market was specially closed in the afternoon because today is August 13th, and the industry associations agreed to close the market.) As a result, the price fell by 55 yuan compared to the previous day. The informal market outside the market was doing well up to 5805 yuan before noon, and there were no sellers. In the afternoon, there was news of a conflict between Japan and Russia, and the final price had fallen to between 5720 and 5730 yuan. The price fluctuated by 55 yuan in half a day. The selling price of cash shops for their own brand of gold was about a dozen yuan higher than cash gold, and the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current margin gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there was little trading.

Jewelry Gold Also Listed 10 Yuan Lower

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael at jewelry stores: Initially, Da Tong Hang still quoted 600 yuan, but at 12:05 PM, the price was listed 10 yuan lower, and there were no changes after that. It was estimated that Da Tong Hang changed the quote to 590 yuan, and the new prices were similar, with the buying price reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Discount Rate Down Another Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for foreign exchange draft notes was slightly lower. In the morning, the discount rate was still 44 yuan per thousand yuan for buying and 46 yuan for selling. In the afternoon, it fell to 45 yuan for selling and 43 yuan for buying, which was one yuan lower than last Saturday. The call loan rate of the Money Trade Association has returned to 0.01 yuan and is quoted at 0.14 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Rise and Fall Sharply

Yesterday's foreign currency market conditions: Because cash gold was fluctuating downwards, British and American gold pounds also fell by 1.5 yuan each. The supply of British gold suddenly surged, and the price fell by 0.5 yuan. American gold tickets once rose to 18.65 yuan, but suddenly there was a conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union in the afternoon, causing all parties to supply heavily. The price once fell to 18.08 yuan, and the final price was 18.13 yuan, which was 0.47 yuan lower than last Saturday. The demand for Hong Kong tickets decreased sharply, and the price fell by 0.04 yuan. Japanese gold tickets gradually recovered, and the evening market fell back to 1.36 yuan. The supply of Korean tickets was endless, and the market price continued to fall, with the evening market falling back to 1.06 yuan.

### Grains
### Rice Prices Soft, Market Closed Today for Commemoration

The rice market is currently closed for the usual weekly holiday. Yesterday, however, the market opened with a sudden recovery, and as a result, all kinds of imported rice saw a drop of a yuan or more. This was because gold and foreign exchange had weakened, and people's confidence was correspondingly weak. Moreover, the sources of supply were uninterrupted. Not only did the original wholesalers no longer hold onto their goods firmly, but also speculative and retail investors were thinking about transactions, and they were all selling more and buying less. On the sales side, general sales agents were mostly watching due to the high prices, and they were all hesitant. In this situation, they became even more cautious. Except for local stores that slightly increased their purchases to meet needs, dealers from the inland provinces all stopped buying. Moreover, the Ningbo dealers also stopped due to shipping relations, which caused the overall situation to quickly become a case of supply exceeding demand. The market was falling step by step. From morning to noon, there was no slight increase in price. As a result, the closing price fell by a yuan or more compared to the previous market. It was estimated that Grade 1 old Saigon rice was only 58.50 yuan or 58.20 yuan, and new grade rice was 57 yuan. Because of the August 13th commemoration, actual sales were not strong, because it was inconvenient to ship goods. Most people planned to handle it after the martial law was lifted. The dealers and wholesalers also lacked the ability to absorb it, and speculative and retail investors were selling it back. The opening price of the early market was already falling, and the current price of rice was down by 0.50 to 1 yuan in the afternoon. Recovered Saigon Grade 2 opened at 63 yuan and 63.20 yuan, also down 0.30 yuan. In addition, the price of Siam rice at 63.20 yuan was down 0.60 yuan. In total, less than 200 tons of recovered original packages were available, and only 3,000 bags of spot goods were available. Today is the August 13th commemoration, and the rice industry is closed for one day.

Imported rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Yih Ho foreign firm's Tai Sheng ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (Sunday), carrying 1,047 bags from Haiphong and 7,253 bags from Hong Kong, for a total of several thousand bags. It docked at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload.

Although there were no arrivals of glutinous rice, whether domestic or foreign, the market was also difficult to maintain due to the relatively high price quotes, and it was also falling by one or two yuan. It was estimated that Jin Li special yuan was 61-62 yuan, Chang Dan goods were 60 yuan, 50 yuan, second-rate old Su Huang was 55 yuan, Hong Kong special yuan was 60 yuan, Zhong Guan was 57-58 yuan, and second-rate Huang glutinous rice was 53-54 yuan.

For thick and thin Japonica rice, the old goods from the [unclear] district were almost sold out, and they had been lacking in shipments for a long time. Only some Southern Japonica rice and early rice had arrived. Yesterday, about a thousand bags continued to arrive. It was rumored that the informal market was quiet because imported rice was falling and the weather was hot and humid, so it was not suitable to store too much. At the same time, the owners of the goods wanted to sell as soon as the new goods were on the market, so the selling price was looser, and it depreciated by a yuan along with other goods. Changbang Xian Qing Japonica was 69 yuan, special Japonica was around 68 yuan, Wuxi Qing Japonica was 66-67 yuan, Changzhou Su Kun Japonica was 66 yuan, second-rate Su was 63 yuan, and Nanhang early rice was 64 yuan for original packages, 65 yuan for special, 61.50 yuan per hu, and 60 yuan for second-rate.

The source of new Japonica rice from Zhoupu is gradually increasing, with about 30 to 40 dan, but the sales are becoming worse. In the face of the weakening of other goods, the price is also falling by 0.50 yuan. The opening price was 63 yuan and 62.50 yuan.

### Mooncake Season Approaches, Flour in High Demand

Yesterday, the flour market first stabilized and then became brisk. It was found that the price of the Second Flour Mill was still 15 yuan. The mills were unable to supply large quantities because their stock of flour was running out and they were not receiving raw materials, so production was reduced. However, the actual sales of local merchants were quite good because of the need for mooncakes. It was heard that Yantai, Longkou, Qinhuangdao and other places were all paying attention to the Japanese Phoenix brand flour in addition to dealing with Chinese factory flour. The Phoenix flour for this month initially opened at 14.55 yuan, and then rose to 14.65 yuan, with 2,000 bags traded. It was reported that 3,000 bags were also opened for September, with a price of 14.70 yuan. It was heard that it was purchased by the Nanyang dealers. The price of domestic flour was 14.60 to 14.70 yuan, and the price of imported flour was 16.20 to 16.30 yuan. The market first stabilized and then became brisk.

Wheat Yesterday, the wheat market was quite stable. It was found that the source from Hongkou and Zhabei had decreased due to the August 13th commemoration and martial law, but there was still a lot of stock. The Japanese factories took the opportunity to increase prices and absorb supply because the flour sales had not been weak recently, while the Chinese factories had difficulty transporting goods and had difficulty receiving them smoothly. A total of more than 5,000 bags were traded in the market, all of which were purchased by Sanxin, Xiexing and other factories, with prices ranging from 19.50 yuan to 20 yuan. On the Chinese factory side, although the price was increased to 22 yuan, it was still difficult to continuously ship them. The market will be closed for one day for the August 13th commemoration.

### Miscellaneous Grains
### New and Old Soybeans Disconnected

Recently, the soybean market has been facing a situation where the old soybeans have been running out daily. The remaining stock in the hands of the original discount holders is only 3,000 to 4,000 bags, and the floating chips on the market are only 2,000 to 3,000 bags. As for the new soybeans, they have already entered the market in the producing areas, but due to transportation problems, they cannot be shipped to Shanghai. (It is rumored that some Changzhou Qingpi and Qingpi Huang may arrive within the week.) Therefore, there are concerns about the disconnection between new and old soybeans, and there are fears of shortages. Therefore, most of the buying and selling is done secretly. Yesterday, it was reported in the market that Qingdao soybeans had opened at 34 yuan, with 400 to 500 bags purchased by the Shantou gang. Over a hundred bags of Anqing soybeans were inquired about on this street, with a price of 29 yuan, and 400 bags of Pudong Du soybeans, with a price of 33 yuan, followed by 31 yuan. In addition, 1,290 bags of soybeans, 435 bags of raw peanuts, and 550 cans of soybean oil will be shipped to Hong Kong today. Yesterday, 1,000 sheets of soybean cake were shipped to Little Luzon, and 6,515 bags of fertilizer powder were shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai.

### Miscellaneous Items
### Cigarette Prices Have Softened Slightly

The cigarette market: The informal market is like the Great Britain brand, where the hoarders have cleared out their remaining stock, causing the market to be tight. The Little Fragrant Building brand produced by the Great Eastern Company has recently seen strong purchases by the Jiangbei gang, and the Ma Fang delivery is not timely, with a price of 446 yuan. The Five Flowers brand has more shipments, and the market is showing a weakening trend. Yesterday, the Great Britain brand was 1,080 yuan, the Five Flowers brand was 492 yuan, the Little Fairy brand was 488 yuan, and other brands were stable.

### Securities
### Securities Half-Day Trading

Securities in the informal market were traded for only half a day yesterday due to the inconvenience of clearing and settlement under martial law. The market was closed yesterday afternoon and will remain closed today. Therefore, there was slightly more trading in the morning yesterday. The trend was that there were slight changes in the environment, people were in a trance, and the market gradually weakened. The opening price of Category C shares was raised by many parties to 49.80 yuan, but after the opening, the selling pressure surged. Although Lianyi, Jiufeng, Yongkang, and No. 16 bought in, the pressure from the selling of Songmao, Hongda, and No. 11 was greater, and the many parties gradually withdrew, so the result was a slight decrease of 0.10 to 0.30 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 400,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below.

The market is temporarily closed for one day today due to the inconvenience of clearing and settlement under martial law, and there will be no trading.

Stock trading: 100 shares of the New Asia [unclear] Factory stock were traded, with a price of 22.50 yuan.

### Sugar Market
### Imported Sugar Falls Back

Yesterday the sugar market was relatively flat in the morning, initially stable, but in the afternoon, due to the slight increase in foreign exchange rates, it fell back slightly. The Association's listed prices: Current spot coarse white sugar, 73 yuan to 72.50 yuan at the local warehouse, 73 yuan to 72.50 yuan at the foreign warehouse, and 72 yuan in the afternoon, down one yuan.

The market prices followed the decline.

### Seafood

Western mussels have recently become more active and the market price has risen again. Yesterday, large mussels were 190 yuan, up 5 yuan, and medium mussels were 158 yuan, up 8 yuan. The market outlook is stable.

Due to foreign exchange rates, the combined price of black pepper has increased, and the market has been boosted. Yesterday, black large and No. 1 pepper were both 104 yuan, up 3 yuan. However, white pepper, which had not fallen before, is now stable and has not changed.

### Yarn and Cotton
### Cotton Yarn Market Closed, Cotton Market Even Quieter

The Shanghai foreign cotton market was unusually quiet all day. All parties were planning to remain on the sidelines, waiting for the development of all parties. In general, it is expected that there will be no possibility of a turnaround in the cotton market for a few days.

### Piece Goods
### Domestic Sales of Cotton Cloth Gradually Forming, Factory Prices High

Domestic cloth: The trend is stable, because the hoarders are taking a wait-and-see attitude, and the purchase by Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong inland areas is quite strong. The factory prices are high. The Yih Ho coarse cloth factory currently has insufficient stock to meet demand, and the selling price has risen by 0.25 yuan per piece. The Chinese coarse cloth factory has only 16 pounds of goods, and the price has risen by 0.25 to 0.50 yuan per piece.

Exports: Today, there were 190 pieces of cotton cloth shipped to Hong Kong, and yesterday, there were also 45 pieces shipped to Little Luzon.

### An Overview of Woolen Cloth Orders: Past and Present (Continued from the 4th Day's Newspaper)

â Fu Shi Sheng

Recently, the number of Chinese and foreign experts in the woolen cloth business has increased. There are Renji, Yongkang, Yongcheng, Dahua, Ge Mei, Luofu, Fengyu, Anmao, Meilun, Xieli, Xiaochen, Daxin, Jiufu, Dahua, Yuwu, Yideng, Ruifeng, Ruixing, Zhengtai, Kairui, Maoli, Huacheng, Maoyi, Xingtai, Nanmei, Bente, Hengtesheng, Ankaidi, etc. Generally, before the tenth year of the Republic of China, British trading firms held the top position in the woolen cloth market. From the eleventh to the twentieth years of the Republic of China, French, German, Italian, American, and Polish trading firms dominated the woolen cloth market. Since the "January 28th Incident" around that time, Japanese trading firms rose rapidly, defeating the British, French, German, and Italian firms. However, after the twentieth year of the Republic of China, Chinese and British trading firms once again dominated the woolen cloth order market, running neck and neck. Currently, the more prosperous businesses include Meifeng, Meichen, Youyi, and Changtai. Those with more robust spot goods businesses include Hengtesheng, Abeshi, Ankaidi Bente, Abe, etc. The reason for the development of Chinese trading firms is that they save on commissions for Western merchants and accept meager profits. Therefore, their business has been very prosperous recently. When disputes arise, Chinese firms are more responsible and handle matters more quickly than Western firms. Therefore, Chinese stores find it much cheaper to deal with Chinese trading firms. This is evidence of the progress of Chinese woolen cloth merchants and a gratifying phenomenon.

Initially, there were not many woolen cloth businesses and foreign firms in Shanghai. Most orders were placed through shopkeepers going to the trading firms. If Rongtai directly purchased woolen cloth, such as good quality hua sha, serge, etc., it was impossible to place orders, as no deposit was required. Additionally, the brand was old, sales were brisk, and profits were assured (at that time, customs duties were not autonomous, and taxes were low, which also played a role). Later, woolen cloth trading firms flourished, with new management and constantly updated patterns and colors. The power to accommodate orders shifted from the trading firms to the shops. Currently, woolen cloth sales are primarily based on goods from Shanghai weaving factories. Since the frequent exchange rate changes of the previous year and spring, foreign firms have mostly changed their prices from shillings to US dollars. Manufacturers in Italy even require a 20% deposit in foreign currency (since Italy entered the war, not only can orders not be placed, but it is also difficult to know when previously placed orders will arrive). As a result, ordering has become a matter of give-and-take, with trading firms accommodating shops and shops accommodating trading firms. If a shop has a wide range of business, large capital, and many salesmen, the trading firms will not want to collect a deposit first, and it will be necessary for the trading firm to accommodate the shop. Conversely, if a shop has a small scope, poor credit, and the market changes rapidly in these uncertain times, the trading firm will be deeply concerned that the shop will only pay taxes and take delivery of the goods if they are profitable, and will ignore them if they are at a loss. It will be difficult for such shops to place orders, and they will naturally have to accommodate the trading firm. (The End)

### Fundraising to Build a Wooden Bridge in Longhua Town

Several philanthropists plan to build a wooden bridge at the Puhui Pond ferry crossing north of the Longhua Town Temple. Yesterday, Mr. Cao Shunfu sent a letter to this newspaper, along with a drawing. The river flows from west to east, with a bend in the middle. To the east is the Baibu Bridge, and to the west is the New Wooden Bridge, about three miles apart. The villagers dislike the roundabout and long route, so they set up a ferry in the middle of the river to help pedestrians. However, during windy and rainy weather, there is always caution when inquiring about passage. It is still remembered that on the fifteenth day of the third month of the previous year, due to the large number of pilgrims, the boat capsized, and some people drowned. Instead of risking danger by boat, why not build a bridge at this location, which would be a permanent solution. Moreover, the Baibu and New Wooden Bridges are also gradually collapsing, so it is not only dangerous for those crossing by ferry, but also for those climbing over these two bridges. However, building a new wooden bridge will cost about 300 gold coins, so it is necessary to raise donations. It is now known that Mr. Zheng Mingguan Ying, Mr. Ye Ming Chengzhong, Mr. Li Ming Chaoqin, Mr. Lu Ming Wenbin, Mr. Li Ming Wenyao, Mr. Wang Ming Xiaocai, and Mr. Cao Ming Xiang and other initiators have each contributed, and they have also widely solicited donations, collecting a total of 300 yuan in donations, which has been submitted to the Tongren Fuwu Hall. It is planned to select a location and ask for an auspicious date to start construction. The largest donation came from the Lao Shunji Shop, which contributed about 40 yuan in materials and iron nails for the pine railing, followed by an anonymous Mr. Li with 31 yuan, Lu Zihuai with 20 yuan, and the smallest donation being one jiao.

### The Attitude Towards Life

â Wang Ting

I often hear many "worldly" people say: "In life, the most important thing is to be 'slick,' and the second is to be 'content'âyoung people especially should avoid being too sharp," "Being discontented rarely leads to good results."

Many people say this: many people regard this as the truth of life; however, I believe that the "truth" in the mouths of many people is not necessarily completely correct.

In the eyes of many "money-onlyists," people exist for money; in the eyes of many "love-supremacists," people exist for the youth and passion of their lovers; in the eyes of many vain people, people exist for material enjoyment and superficial fame...

For these people, being slick and content is naturally very beneficial to them. They can use it to obtain money, obtain the youth and passion of their lovers, and obtain the satisfaction of all vain fame!

However, for a person who passionately loves life and values the meaning of life above money and the satisfaction of all worldly desires, being slick and content is completely uselessâ"slickness" is the product of hypocrisy plus hypocrisy reaching a saturation point; in a serious life, hypocrisy has no place, while the meaning of "contentment" is the foolish satisfaction of a person with no ambition. This foolish satisfaction will hinder all human wisdom and progress!

If primitive humans had been "content" long ago, wouldn't we still be in the barbaric age of cave dwelling and raw food? If Columbus had been "content," where would people have seen the new world of America?

Therefore, a person who passionately loves life and seriously faces life should abandon all worldly notions of slickness and contentment. He should offer sincerity to people, and he should bravely "discontent" himself in this hateful environmentâall human evolution comes from the agitation of dissatisfaction and discontent!

The meaning of people's existence is not only to work for their own happiness and the satisfaction of their desires, but also to work for the happiness and satisfaction of the desires of future generations!

### Byrd's Antarctic Expedition Success

â Wen He

On the morning of December 4th last year, the American three-masted ship "Bear" passed through the Panama Canal. After departing, it sailed smoothly, heading straight for Antarctica. After twenty-five days, the weather gradually deteriorated, and icebergs also appeared. On the morning of December 31st, a group of Antarctic ice floes appeared on the horizon. This is the northern fence of the Antarctic continent.

The "Bear" sometimes bypassed and sometimes passed through some ice floes, taking two weeks to reach "Little America." Rear Admiral Byrd, the expedition leader, had made arrangements there during his previous two expeditions, so he still used "Little America" as a base this time. Although Rear Admiral Byrd is not receiving a salary, he is on a government-commissioned expedition. The mission of the "Bear" is to survey the unknown coast of Antarctica along the South Pacific. If the coastline can be determined, then the US State Department believes that the United States can more confidently claim the vast territory between "Little America" and the "Palma Peninsula" as its own. The flagship of the expedition is the "Bear," which has a seaplane on board. Whenever the ship is blocked by ice and snow, the plane flies out. There is also a supply ship, the "North Star." Using these tools, Rear Admiral Byrd surveyed a total of 900 miles of coastline in three months, examined six mountain ranges, and 150,000 square miles of unknown land (including the previous two expeditions, Byrd has surveyed 800,000 square miles of land). In addition, he discovered 14 new islands and countless harbors.

The base in Little America is now guarded by 33 people. Byrd then traveled 4,900 miles east and established another base in Marguerite Bay in early March, which is now guarded by 26 people. Important exploration work is now underway in both places simultaneously.

Although the expedition has a 50-ton, rubber-wheeled "snow cruiser," the most important means of transportation in the Arctic is still the Eskimo dog. The ship's supplies are transported to the base by dogs. In the east, the dogs are housed in kennels, but in Little America, the climate is so cold that the dogs are kept in snow caves. When the dogs are not out, they often eat seal meat; on the road, they eat "pemmican," which is a food made of dried meat mixed with grains, fat, and cod liver oil.

There is also an artist who volunteered to join the expedition. His name is Leland Curtis. He paints very well and loves skiing. Before embarking on the expedition, he studied at the California Institute of Technology for several months and invented a new type of oil paint medium that does not freeze at minus 50 degrees. With such a pigment, he can fully depict the Antarctic landscape. He also often draws sketches for his companions to increase their interest in the journey.

### Overthrow Charitable Education!

â Wang Qing

I work in an institution that educates and cares for orphans. The scale of this institution is quite large, and its funding is considered ample. Those great philanthropists who spare no expense in donating large sums to benefit orphans are worthy of praise!

However, what I do not approve of is the attitude of those who manage the institution.

Generally, those who run orphan education institutions hold compassionate hearts. They see the suffering of orphans with no home to return to, wandering in distress, and thus compassionately run orphan education programs. They do not understand that receiving education and care is actually a right of children, and that providing children with education and care is the responsibility of society, which is completely different from charity. The enthusiasm of philanthropists is indeed commendable, but their attitude is not something I dare to agree with.

Based on this incorrect attitude, orphan education institutions generally have many unreasonable practices. Teachers hold children in contempt, scolding and beating them at will. When orphans are naughty, they simply utter insults like "You have no parents!" "Cheap bones!" "Beggar's seed!" For economic reasons, these institutions mostly teach orphans some productive skills. Military bands, rattan weaving, sock knitting, and barbering seem on the surface to be implementing vocational education, but upon closer examination, the working hours often exceed eight hours, and educational opportunities are sacrificed as a result, essentially amounting to disguised child labor! And a percentage of the proceeds from production is deducted to cover expenses, which can be considered the ultimate exploitation.

Due to the above, the impact on children's psychology is truly cruel and severe. They are accustomed to various forms of "abuse," accustomed to hearing words of contempt, and accustomed to seeing the attitude of staff members as if they were beggars. Moreover, the names of the institutions include words like "relief," "poverty," "distress," "benefit," "orphan," etc., fostering a special sense of inferiority, making them feel that their fate is only fit for slavery. Alas, "There is no greater sorrow than a dead heart." Is there anything more tragic and painful than this in the world?

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the people of New Jersey in the United States, in opposition to pauper schools, issued a declaration that included the following words:

"We absolutely reject this narrow view of pauper education, considering it worthless. Did the Creator create a coarser soil, a thinner air, a fainter sky for the poor? Does the brilliant sunlight shine on the humble huts of the poor and the ornate eaves of the wealthy in the same way? Do the children of thatched-roof homes have the same feeling for all the freshness, greenness, fragrance, tones, and lush beauty as the fair-skinned sons of emperors? Or did the Creator add a mark of humble birth to the soul, so that poor children are born knowing that their fate is only to crawl, not to ascend to the heavens? It is not so. The Creator does not do this. Man cannot do this. The soul cannot be diminished. The soul is supreme. It does not bear signs of high or low, rich or poor. What it demands is freedom. What it needs is light."

Branding the fire of poverty on the hearts of orphans is a sin.

### ### The Hawthorne Case

### ### The Final Destination of the Dancing Queen

â Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 5: Bad News

Was he here to find Zhao Boxiong? In the space of two or three seconds, this question was immediately answered. His hurried footsteps really entered the west entrance of that corridor. For the sake of caution, I certainly couldn't follow closely behind him. I was confident that nothing I did in the elevator would have aroused his suspicion. He had no reason to suspect me. I had to maintain this advantage of being able to attack without being attacked in order to live up to my mission. I gently released my pace and walked to the west entrance of the corridor, first peeking into the corridor. The young man was still hurrying forward. He also seemed to know the way well, keeping his eyes forward as he walked, unlike us who had been searching for the numbers on the doors. This corridor was somewhat curved. The young man turned around the corner of the curve in a flash, and I could no longer keep him in sight. I quickened my pace, rushed to the corner, stopped, and looked again. Yu Gantang was once again under my control.

He really stood in front of door number 774 and was already raising his hand to knock.

I leaned my body against the wall of the corridor, my head slightly protruding, so I could see him, but he couldn't see me? Fortunately, he wasn't worried about being followed, focusing all his attention on that door. The door of number 774 remained closed. He knocked a second time. This time, the knock was of course heavier and more urgent. He was still using his left hand, his right hand still in his pocket. I began to feel that Hawthorne's questions in the car were not exaggerated. Because of Yu Gantang's posture, there was clearly a pistol hidden in his right pocket; his right hand was clearly always gripping the trigger. I couldn't help but feel a little worried because I didn't have any weapons on me except for a small utility knife.

After a while, the door opened, and an old man in his fifties with a bald head came out, wearing a white silk sleeping gown. (74)

### ### X-Ray Movies to be Released Soon

â Xin Fang

Although the history of cinema is not long, the progress within it has been rapid. From silent to sound to color, and recently we saw the successful experiment of "flavored movies" in this publication, now following closely is a type of "X-ray movie" to meet the world, according to recent news disclosed in a certain Boston newspaper in the United States.

According to the newspaper, this type of movie was invented by several engineers in Pittsburgh. The principle behind the invention is to study a high-speed X-ray tube, making its exposure time during photography as short as one millionth of a secondâfifty times less than the one twenty-thousandth of a second it takes for an eye to blink; at the same time, it can capture the internal structure of opaque objects moving at extremely high speeds or reacting to extremely strong external forces. Therefore, in the future, we will be able to see on the screen how a bullet passes through a row of trees, or how a soccer player kicks a ball.

Dr. Charles Slack, one of the engineers, told the American Physical Society: "The advent of X-ray movies foreshadows a day when everything that the film industry has considered impossible will become possible!" He also said: "The fastest exposure time for ordinary X-ray photography is one-hundredth of a second."

The invention of "X-ray movies" has created a new era in the history of film; people in the universe will be able to discover new worlds on the screen!

### ### Understanding Peking Opera

â Jun Mei

Some guests say that Peking Opera has no value, which undeniably shows their lack of understanding of it. Peking Opera criticizes current affairs and customs, deeply influencing society, but it does so subtly, rarely revealing it openly. The author also has very little understanding of Peking Opera, but having heard and seen it, I will briefly discuss what I have observed:

Peking Opera's encouragement and satire of life's problems, in addition to direct depictions, are often expressed through humor and absurdity. Therefore, although the lyrics of clown and female roles sometimes involve vulgarity and the actions are somewhat obscene, the depth of their stimulation and the delicacy of their depiction, such as Wang Xiaoer's New Year and Zhang Biegou's Wife Borrowing, portraying the tragic oppression suffered by poor women, cannot fail to evoke sighs of sympathy from the audience beyond a laugh. Also, plays like Yutang Chun and Huiji City depict Su San and Shi Zhongyu exposing the crimes of scholar-officials in court, making a loud appeal for prostitutes. The clown Xu Jie in Lei Feng Pagoda casually scolds Xu Xian: "How can you be so mean? You pretty boys have no kindness at all!" On the surface, it's just teasing and joking, but upon reflection, almost all of these depictions have a wonderful connection with life's problems, not to mention the obvious encouragement of loyalty and filial piety. Thus, the value of Peking Opera can be seen from this.

The singing in Peking Opera has a fixed tune, but the melody is infinitely varied. The tune indicates the rules, while the melody changes with the development of the plot, expressing joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, and stimulating the audience's emotions. The same Siping tune, used in Opera Phoenix, is unrestrained, while used in Disturbing the Government Office, it feels desolate and indignant. Therefore, after the Peking Opera audience sits down, they can close their eyes and listen quietly to the singing, and the performance, whether tragic or happy, will be vividly in front of them. As for the concise lyrics and dialogues, which are popular without being vulgar, the listeners, whether they are vendors or scholars, will feel that not a single word can be added or subtracted. Those who consider being close to Kunqu Opera to be elegant, and those who find Qinqiang Opera to be almost deteriorating, will eventually be eliminated. Thus, the beauty of its rhetoric and diction is sufficient to assist the development of popular culture.

Peking Opera is based on singing and dancing. Every turn, every bow, has artistry. Therefore, a play does not need so-called backgrounds to be naturally wonderful. Sometimes, a very small number of characters appear on stage, such as Little Cowherd, Wujia Slope, Fenhe Bay, and Three Mothers Teach Son. The entire play has only two or three people. Lin Chong Night Escape has only one person from beginning to end. The audience knows to concentrate and appreciate its melody and movements, without feeling monotonous or boring. As for the simplicity of the props, the small movements when using the props, and the facial makeup to express good and evil, wisdom and stupidity, loyalty and treachery, virtue and worthlessness, everything reveals its conformity to dance, which is especially rich in artistic effect.

Peking Opera rose between the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods of the Qing Dynasty, and has been able to stand strong for over a hundred years. The above-mentioned factors are also the reason for its value. Although with the passage of time, it is inevitably criticized for being backward, it can retain its essence and delete its dross. It should not be regarded merely as ordinary entertainment.

### ### Interesting Anecdotes from Entertaining the Entertainment Circle

â Cheng

The Shanghai Relief Orphanage invited celebrities, famous performers, and famous actors to broadcast and solicit funds. They specially invited colleagues from the entertainment circle and radio station managers to the Atlantic Hotel last night. The seating arrangement was in the shape of the Chinese character "å·." The chairman of the orphanage, Yuan Ludeng, the director-general, Pan Hongding, and the head of the care department, Cheng Zhiliang, sat in the main seats and cordially entertained the guests. Dozens of people, including Tan Xiaopei, Tan Dangying, Mao Shilai, and Zhou Xinfang, attended. There were many interesting anecdotes at the banquet, which are excerpted below for this publication. When the Tan family arrived, Yuan Ludeng received them warmly. Yuan called Fu Ying "younger brother," behaving very affectionately. He said that he had first seen him perform Dingjun Mountain in Beiping, when Xu Biyun, who played the martial woman, had not yet graduated. Tan Xiaopei said that his son had first come to Shanghai at only eighteen years old, and now he was thirty-five years old. After speaking, they all looked at each other and laughed. Halfway through the banquet, Yuan stood up and said that the orphanage currently had 574 orphans, and each person needed an average of sixteen yuan per month for education and care. The purpose of inviting everyone today was twofold: first, to thank them for their enthusiastic help in the past; second, to ask them to help again during the broadcast. All the guests unanimously said that since it was a matter of charity, it was their duty to do so, and those with a mouth should speak out, hoping that those with money in society would donate money. Because of work, the movie stars were unable to come in time, and Han Langan represented them alone, promising to collaborate with Yuan Lao Bobo again during the broadcast to sing Wang Laowu (last year, he and Yuan sang Wang Laowu at the Lido Ballroom, and someone donated 500 yuan). In addition, he planned to invite all the female stars to help. Immediately, it was decided to hold a joint broadcast today (the 13th) at the four radio stations of Zhongxi, Xin Xin, Guohua, and Mingyuan during the time when each radio station stopped broadcasting programs.

Producer Jack Warner is said to have ordered that German be banned from Warner Bros. However, the Warner Bros. technical department says this is not true because many employees will not be able to communicate.

Samuel Goldwyn reportedly wants to borrow David Niven from the British Army to make a film.

Because various companies are competing to make anti-Nazi films, there are suddenly many people wearing Nazi uniforms on the streets, causing timid residents to suspect that the Fifth Column has arrived in the film city. The anti-Nazi films currently in production include MGM's "Escape" and "The Mortal Storm," and Fox's "Four Sons" and "I Married a Nazi."

With the situation in Southern Europe urgent, the mobilization of the Balkan countries, which have long been the source of wigs for the film city, has brought the work on nine films in production that require wigs to a near standstill.

### ### Li Xiangjun Dies Tragically

â Ling

âA Tragic and Beautiful Scene

The play "Li Xiangjun" is being staged by the China Travel Troupe with great enthusiasm; the movie "Li Xiangjun" is also being made by Golden Star with great concentration and effort, and is now more than halfway through filming. The following picture shows the beginning of the last climax of "Li Xiangjun." After suffering countless hardships and experiencing turmoil, Li Xiangjun lived in seclusion in the Qituo Nunnery in Suzhou while ill. At this time, the Ming Dynasty was in decline, and the Qing army flag had been raised high above the city of Nanjing. Liu Jingting, entrusted by Hou Chaozong, had braved the wind and dust to find the Qituo Nunnery; soon Hou Chaozong also followed and arrived, reuniting with Xiangjun after their separation, and for a time, they were filled with mixed feelings of sorrow and joy. Unexpectedly, Hou Chaozong was limited by his environment and did not maintain his integrity in his later years, having already taken the Qing government's examination. When Xiangjun heard this news, she was extremely disappointed and vomited blood, and the beautiful woman died with regret, making people sigh endlessly. The five people in the picture, from right to left, are Hou Chaozong (played by Bai Yun), Liu Jingting (Zhou Qi), Li Xiangjun (Gu Lanjun), Bian Yujing (Chen Lu), and Rou Rou (Liu Diyan).
