### British and French Armies Prepare, Continue to Enlist

London authorities have issued orders for reservists of the 1911 and 1910 classes to register on June 15th and June 22nd respectively. Thus, an additional 600,000 people will be registered for service before the end of June (Reuters, 28th).

### British and French Commercial Telegrams Temporarily Suspended

London - The British War Office has announced that due to busy military communications, telegram services to France are temporarily suspended, and postal services are subject to certain restrictions. Therefore, no telegrams may be sent to France from now on (Reuters, 28th).

### Belgian King Orders Armistice with Germany - Allied Forces Encircled on Three Sides in the North - German Forces' Fierce Attack on Dunkirk Fails - Allied Forces Continue to Retreat on the Scheldt River

Paris - The French General Headquarters announced yesterday that the British army's counterattack against the German forces in the area of Aire-sur-la-Lys was very successful. However, the communiqué also stated that after reaching the Aire area, the German forces entered the center of the Allied forces' positions defended by one million troops. The communiqué did not specify whether the German forces reaching the Aire area entered from the south or the east (Associated Press, 28th).

Paris - According to French military sources last night, the Allied forces launched a fierce new offensive yesterday and retreated from the Scheldt River, north of the German corridor. German General Walter, disregarding troop sacrifices, ordered a fierce attack on the Allied forces, forcing them to retreat (Associated Press, 28th).

Paris - According to news last night, as only Dunkirk and Ostend, on the English Channel coast, remain in the hands of the Allied forces, German forces have encircled the million Allied troops isolated in the north on three sides. The German forces are trying to cut the Allied forces in the north into three sections. One German force is advancing towards Calais in an attempt to break through the southern part of the Allied forces, while another German force is advancing north, attempting to reach Dunkirk via Ypres. Dunkirk is now threatened from the southeast. However, it was announced at the military headquarters last night that the British army's counterattack in the Lys River area southeast of Ypres was quite successful yesterday, blocking the German forces advancing towards Dunkirk from the east (Associated Press, 28th).

Paris - The General Headquarters has just issued a battle report stating: (1) The enemy in our northern area launched a fierce attack on the Belgian defense lines; (2) Between the North Sea coast and Merville (north of Lille), the British army attacked a larger number of enemy troops in the Aire area along the Lys River, with considerable success; (3) In the Somme area, our army, with the assistance of the air force, launched a favorable attack; (4) On the east bank of the Aisne River, the enemy launched a fierce attack on our positions (Havas, 27th).

London - According to reliable military sources today, the German advances in the Flanders region on Tuesday pose a threat not only to separating the British, French, and Belgian troops in the "gap" of northern France and Belgium from the rest of the Allied forces, but also to cutting off the main bases and supply depots of the Allied forces. It is also stated that the fate of the northern Allied forces will depend on the outcome of the current bloody battle near Hazebrouck and Merville. If the German forces break through the lines between Hazebrouck and Merville, they can join the German armored divisions besieging Calais and encircle the northern Allied forces (Associated Press, 28th).

London - According to well-informed sources in London last night, the situation in northern France is becoming increasingly serious (Reuters, 28th).

London - The War Office has just issued a battle report stating: "The enemy launched fierce attacks on the French and Belgian forces on both flanks of our expeditionary force on the front line today. Our army, with the assistance of French tank units, launched a counterattack with considerable success. Within Belgian territory, our army fought alongside the Belgian army, and the enemy's repeated large-scale attacks have all failed, and our positions remain unshaken. In addition, enemy aircraft carried out fierce bombing raids on the front line, many of which were shot down by our anti-aircraft units," (Havas, 27th).

London - A reporter from Paris Radio last night broadcast that Calais is currently firmly defended by our army and will be defended with all our might. The reporter, after mentioning the German side's reckless waste of manpower and material resources, stated that the German army's strategy in Flanders and Antwerp was self-destructive. One example of this astonishing waste was that during a German air raid on Calais, forty-three aircraft were shot down by fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns. London has just received news of a small British detachment's determination to resist the German army. It is reported that a British engineering unit of only 300 men, all armed with rifles, was attacked by hundreds of German armored vehicles and motorcycle machine guns. After several hours of fierce fighting, they inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy before retreating. The British anti-aircraft units were under particularly heavy attack by the German side. On one occasion, a British unit of 170 men encountered a German vanguard advancing towards a port on the Channel. They preferred to fight fiercely and lose two-thirds of their unit rather than surrender. The survivors then retreated and joined the main British force in the rear (Reuters, 28th).

Unprecedented Fierce Fighting in the Flanders Region - German Forces Continue to Occupy Several Towns

Berlin - The German High Command issued a battle report this afternoon stating that unprecedented fierce fighting has taken place in the Flanders and Artois regions. Our army launched a full-scale attack and has already destroyed the enemy's resistance. The area of activity of the encircled British and French Allied forces is becoming increasingly narrow. Our army has now advanced to within ten kilometers of Bruges. After crossing the Tielt River, our army engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy and occupied the enemy artillery positions on the opposite bank. The King of Belgium and the Belgian army, realizing that there was no hope of reversing the battle, laid down their weapons and surrendered to the German army. The number of Belgian soldiers who surrendered is four to five hundred thousand. Our army is continuing to intensify its encirclement of the British and French Allied forces. The French positions north of Valenciennes have been broken through by our forces. A section of the Scheldt River west of Valenciennes has also been crossed by our army, and the cities of Orchies and Douai have been occupied. The enemy in the western sector has been defeated by our forces. Lillers, Hazebrouck, Bailleul have fallen. Our air force continues to bomb the areas of Zeebrugge, Ostend, and Dunkirk. An enemy destroyer between Calais and Dover was destroyed by our bombing (Haitong News Agency, 28th).

Berlin - During the last World War, the battle of Loos lasted for twelve months, while the current German army occupied Loos, near Arras, in just two days. German tank divisions attacked northern France and, after fierce fighting, occupied the Loos heights. German artillery only targeted military objectives. The villages of Souchez, Ablain-Saint-Nazaire, etc., show no signs of war (Haitong News Agency, 28th).

Rome - According to a "Stefani News Agency" reporter, German forces advanced towards the area between the Scheldt estuary and Calais on the 26th, with the assistance of tanks and aircraft. The Allied forces fought and retreated. German forces advanced to the area between Valenciennes and Le Cateau-Cambrésis. French and Belgian troops retreated to the vicinity of Menen and Deinze. After the Belgian defense line was broken through, German mechanized units crossed Ypres. German forces are also advancing along the coast towards Dunkirk and Hazebrouck. In the Ghent area, German forces are attacking the Bruges area, with the support of aircraft, armored units, and tanks. The German army lost many artillery pieces near Valenciennes, and at that time, the German army used strong searchlights to prevent the enemy from looking up (Haitong News Agency, 28th).

Berlin - According to a report from Haitong News Agency correspondent Fülvi, the roads in the northern French cities of Kiivit, Caberet, Arras, and Richebourg have all been damaged. The roads are full of military vehicles that cannot be used after being shot by the German army. The road from the Meuse River to Abbeville is full of military equipment, machine guns, rifles, document boxes, military rations, and baggage, all left behind by the enemy during their retreat. Burned cars, trucks, and anti-aircraft guns can still be seen in the forests on both sides (Haitong News Agency, 28th).

Belgian King Requests Armistice with Germany - 500,000 Belgian Soldiers Have Surrendered

German Supreme Headquarters - The German Supreme Headquarters announced this afternoon that the King of Belgium, under intense pressure from the German army, has requested an armistice and accepted the German side's demand for unconditional surrender. At the time of conquest, considering our country's loyal and brave soldiers with the spirit of sacrificing everything without hesitation, breaking through the world's strongest defensive engineering with unwavering determination, the German people, in addition to joy, cannot help but admire (Haitong News Agency, 28th).

German Supreme Headquarters - This afternoon's communiqué stated that the German Supreme Commander has ordered that the King of Belgium and the Belgian army be treated with the respect due to brave warriors. Although the King of Belgium has not expressed any desire regarding his personal comfortable life, I have designated a mansion as the King of Belgium's residence. The Belgian army laying down arms this time numbers around 500,000 (Haitong News Agency, 28th).

London - The Belgian army consists of a total of one million men, organized into four corps, each with six infantry divisions and two cavalry divisions. This army is commanded by King Leopold of Belgium as Supreme Commander. Belgium has no navy, and its air force has only 300 aircraft (Associated Press, 28th).

Berlin - German authorities today issued statements praising the Belgian army, saying that the Belgian army, in the hands of the German enemy, is the best army in terms of morale, material resources, and tactics. They also stated that Germany recognizes the King of Belgium as a man of honor and a practical officer. The German army's advance was very slow when fighting the Belgian army, but it proceeded very quickly when fighting the British and French armies. German military circles also greatly admire the King of Belgium, saying that compared to other kings who fled to England and relied on British protection, he is still a leader of the Belgian army (Associated Press, 28th).

Reynaud Delivers Heartfelt Speech - Grief and Indignation at the King of Belgium's Betrayal

Paris - Prime Minister Reynaud's broadcast speech this morning, regarding King Leopold of Belgium's order to cease hostilities, was worded with great grief, roughly stating, "British and French soldiers, at the painful appeal of Leopold III, went to Belgium to help. How could Leopold III disregard the British and French soldiers, not even consult them, and cease fighting? This has never been seen before in history. The Belgian government has just told me that the King's decision is completely contrary to the opinions of all responsible cabinet members. The Belgian government is determined to continue fighting to defend the common goal, using the country's available troops, and hopes to train new troops to cooperate with the British and French Allied forces," (Havas, 28th).

Paris - Prime Minister Reynaud delivered a broadcast speech at 8:30 this morning, roughly stating, "I am now reporting to the nation the serious incident that occurred last night. Since 4:00 this morning, the British and French Allied forces have been fighting alone in the north, and can no longer rely on the assistance of the Belgian army. After the enemy broke through our lines on the 14th of this month, our army was cut into two sections, one in the north and one in the south. The southern army is the main force of our army, and its line runs along the Somme and Aisne rivers eastward to the Maginot Line. The Maginot Line is as solid as a rock and has remained unshaken throughout. The northern army is fighting jointly with the British and Belgian armies, and is commanded by our General Blanchard. The Allied forces in this area rely on the port of Dunkirk for supplies. Therefore, as a result of the agreement, the British and French armies are responsible for the defense of the southwest of the port, while the Belgian army is responsible for the northern defense. Unexpectedly, without notifying the British and French Allied forces, this army suddenly surrendered unconditionally under the order of King Leopold III, allowing the German army to advance. Recalling eighteen days ago, King Leopold made an appeal to us, requesting assistance. We did not hesitate and sent troops in accordance with the plan agreed upon by the British, French, and Belgian general staffs last December. Unexpectedly, eighteen days later, King Leopold, without notifying General Blanchard and against the firm opposition of all cabinet members, ordered an unconditional armistice, which is truly tragic. According to history, France has been invaded no less than a hundred times, but has never surrendered. Even in this war, we have unwavering confidence in victory and believe that the future nation will be even greater. We believe that the new soul of France will gradually take shape in the midst of hardship. In short, all our compatriots, whether they are soldiers or not, men, women, old or young, must work ten times harder from now on. The people of the country should know that France often becomes greater in times of adversity. Our army is currently fighting hard under the leadership of the great leader General Weygand, and we believe that the final victory will belong to us," (Havas, 28th).

German Side Claims Control of the Coast - British Troops in the North Show Signs of Retreat

Berlin - According to German military sources last night, the British High Command yesterday ordered rear guard troops in Flanders to engage in fierce battles, apparently to make a large-scale withdrawal of the troops surrounded by German forces along the French and Belgian coast of the English Channel. German bomber squadrons yesterday saw a large number of transport ships in the English Channel ports of Ostend, Dunkirk, and Zeebrugge. They said that the Allied forces' retreat in Flanders would suffer heavy losses because German aircraft were continuously bombing the ports and the small sea area nearby. German military circles claim that after the German army occupied Boulogne and Calais, Britain's position is much more unfavorable than in the last European war. We can now fully control the entrance to the English Channel, and all commercial trade through the sea from London has been blocked. Furthermore, because goods will be piled up in the western ports of Britain, the supply of food and raw materials to the major industrial cities in the north will become even more difficult. The German army's offensive threat to Britain seems to be closer yesterday. Well-informed sources believe that the German army's offensive against Britain will start from the British mainland, with bomber squadrons, air transport squadrons, parachute troops, submarines, fast ships, and transport ships launching simultaneously (Associated Press, 28th).

Berlin - The German army has now reached the English Channel. When the German army advanced to thirty kilometers south of Calais, they were quite surprised not to see any British troops. When armored vehicles entered the village for reconnaissance, the people welcomed them on both sides of the road, which was even more unexpected. It is said that the British army had retreated an hour ago. At that time, the reporter said that a large force of British troops would take over after the British army retreated, so the people were looking forward to the arrival of the British army, while the German army had already arrived half an hour later. The German army continued to advance and captured two trains near a small station. The British soldiers and military supplies in the train were all captured by the German army. The commander of the first division of the French tank force was also captured (Haitong News Agency, 28th).

Berlin - A military expert told a Haitong News Agency reporter that the German army's advance to the English Channel a week ago has created a situation of encircling the Allied forces in northern France and Belgium. The British army's stubborn resistance in the Calais area is to cover the British army's embarkation to return home, but it has been heavily bombed by German aircraft. The British army in that area has not been able to withdraw. The French army has repeatedly attacked the German army from the south, attempting to break through the German defense line, but has not succeeded. The Allied forces have repeatedly announced the occupation of Narvik, but have not gained a foothold. Repeated fierce attacks have resulted in heavy losses, and the British ships that maintain communication lines have also been bombed by German aircraft (Haitong News Agency, 28th).

London - Although war rumors are rampant in London, well-informed sources generally hold the view that if Hitler defeats the British and Belgian Allied forces in the Flanders region, the site of the current fierce fighting, and thus consolidates his position in France and Belgium, then Hitler may propose peace terms to the Allied powers (International News Service, 28th).

Editorial

### Appeals from the Japanese Government and Public

Three days ago, Japanese Prime Minister Yonai delivered a speech at the Spiritual Mobilization Movement meeting, the details of which are unknown; however, based on fragments of the speech transmitted by foreign wires and the subsequent commentaries added by various Tokyo newspapers, after trying to synthesize them, it becomes clear that the Japanese government and public's ideas are contradictory, their emotions are hesitant, and their actions are disjointed and disorganized regarding the current situation and future of the war of aggression against China. It has reached a stage where it can no longer be concealed. Knowledgeable people will inevitably see from this that the end of the aggression is not far away.

The main point of Yonai's speech was to urge his people to cooperate closely with the government, "so as to carry out a comprehensive war to resolve the China Incident." Japan has already instigated its army, navy, and air force to aggressively invade China, using all means, including land attacks, naval blockades, and aerial bombings. Its people and military have contributed their blood, clothing, and food, obeying orders and never resisting. This has been going on for three years, but today it is still necessary to appeal to the people for cooperation and to call for a comprehensive war. Why is this? It is because the troops are old and ineffective, the results of the war are meager, and internally, the suffering and grievances of the people are becoming increasingly deep, while externally, the fatigue and casualties of the troops are becoming increasingly serious. If they change their national policy and lay down their arms, they lack the courage; if they cling to power and insist on their original intentions, they are at a loss. Therefore, they can only hope that their people will make even greater contributions and give the cabinet a final attempt to engage in the so-called comprehensive war. The so-called comprehensive war refers to offensive actions in many aspects, including military, political, diplomatic, and economic. Although the reliance on the people is mainly in the economy, the advocacy of a comprehensive approach is also a way to divert public attention and cover up their military failures.

Among the Tokyo newspaper commentaries on Yonai's speech, the one by the Kokumin Shimbun best reveals their hesitation. It stated that although the "Nanjing Government" has been established, its true strength still needs to be tested. The highest and most important policy of the previous Prime Minister, Duke Konoe, was to continue the war against China until the destruction of the Chinese National Government. This has not yet been realized. It is hoped that the government will quickly end the China Incident and not simply go through the motions and settle the matter hastily while the Chinese National Government continues to resist. What we need is comprehensive peace, not partial peace. As for the European war and the China Incident, they are closely related. No matter how the war ends, Japan must be fully prepared and not just focus on not getting involved in the vortex. Analyzing their arguments, there is disappointment with reality, first; a strong desire for peace, but a warning to the authorities not to deceive themselves, second; and a sense of unease and disadvantage in the overall situation, third. As for the so-called need for further testing and full preparation, which seems to be nothing more than lip service, it is clearly a deceptive statement by the commentator. Why? Because they take the hope of quickly ending the China Incident as their only argument, and they take ending the China Incident as a prerequisite for dealing with the European situation. If this is not achieved as desired, how can there be any other plans?

Observing the various recent expressions from the Japanese side, not only are their actions struggling in difficulty, but their intellect is also struggling in torment. To cite the most prominent examples: the people are impoverished and resources are exhausted, yet they extravagantly hope to gain greatly from the mobilization of resources; the budget is huge, yet the implementation plan cannot be established; the military is in despair, yet they must continue to take risks and adopt local offensives that are irrelevant to the overall situation; the entire court publicly "reciprocates" peace yet continues to spur on frontline combat. In addition, there are many attempts to do things that are known to be useless and ineffective but cannot be stopped, especially in the political, diplomatic, and economic aspects. All these actions are self-inflicted and they are already reaping the consequences. Their momentum will not stop until the final retribution. This is truly the tragedy of the Japanese nation, and no one can effectively pity them. It is not that there is no glimmer of understanding, but all are obscured by vanity and greed. For example, they have long ceased to speak of victory or think of victory, but what they seek is the formal or mutated gains of a victorious country. They know that if the so-called China Incident is not ended, their national defense, economy, and international situation will be surrounded by crises, so they demand a quick end to it with one voice. However, what they are doing is a dead end that is not enough to end the Sino-Japanese War. They know that the European war is an opportunity for them to restore their international status, they know the necessity of striving for international say, they know that China's resistance is like a shackle on them (Asahi Shimbun's words). They are not unaware that immediately withdrawing their troops means immediate freedom, immediately possessing the qualifications to compete for international power, but they are weaving a cocoon to bind themselves. All these things were swept under the rug by the Japanese in the past, but now they are gradually revealing a slight impulse to restore reason. However, vanity has not been removed, greed has not been suppressed, so they are suffering as they are today, contradictory, hesitant, and disjointed as they are today. Although the scope of the European war is wide and the situation is fierce, there is the possibility of drastic changes in the situation, and there is the possibility of sudden clarity and a sharp turn for the worse. If the Japanese people's ideas and actions regarding the Sino-Japanese War are as they are today, then Japan can only accept the inevitable judgment with its final days.

### Speech by Premier in France Declaring Continuation of Resistance, Saying King's Orders Are Not Valid, Belgian Cabinet Holds Emergency Meeting

Following King Leopold III of Belgium's order to cease hostilities, Belgian Premier Pierlot has just delivered a broadcast speech here, stating that the King's separate negotiations with Germany have shocked the nation. However, this mistake does not make our entire nation irresponsible, and our army should not suffer such a fate. Know that no matter what order the King signs, it cannot take effect without the countersignature of a cabinet member. The King has now isolated himself from the nation and subjected himself to the control of the invaders, and is no longer able to govern the country. Therefore, all officers and civil servants do not need to fulfill their oaths and obey his orders. The government will also never abandon its responsibilities. A meeting is being held in Paris, and with the consent of those members of both houses of parliament who can be contacted, it has been decided to continue the war of resistance for the benefit of the nation and to liberate the country. Our youth should now be formed into a new army to fight alongside the British and French allied forces to uphold the common goal of freedom and independence. Those of our people who have not been conscripted and are currently within the borders of the Allied countries should be sent to munitions factories to operate or engage in ordinary work. In short, we are now experiencing the most painful encounter in our country's history and should follow the example of the martyrs of the last World War and not fail. Interior Minister Vanden Broeck then delivered the same speech in Flemish. After the speech, the national anthem was played. Premier Pierlot also led the cabinet members to lay a wreath at the monument to the late King Albert I after the cabinet meeting. Some women around them wept. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

The Belgian cabinet members currently in Paris immediately held an emergency meeting after hearing of King Leopold III's decision to cease hostilities to discuss countermeasures. They all believed that the King's move was contrary to the constitution and advocated continuing the war of resistance. They will continue to meet at noon today, at which time the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Godefroid, and the Speaker of the Senate, Gillons, will both participate. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

After King Leopold III of Belgium ordered his country's troops to cease hostilities, residents here gathered in front of the Belgian Embassy to comment on the matter. The Belgian Ambassador, Marcian, arrived at the embassy at ten o'clock this morning, looking pale, and refused to meet with reporters. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

### French Transfers of Envoys Abroad

The French government gazette has just published an order appointing a number of envoys abroad, the choices as follows:

(1) Ambassador to the Holy See: Taumesson (right-wing Figaro diplomatic reporter), (2) Ambassador to Switzerland: Coulondre (former Ambassador to Germany), (3) Ambassador to Argentina: Thierry (former Ambassador to Romania), (4) Ambassador to Spain: Baumer (former Director of Commerce at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), (5) Ambassador to Romania: Perroudon (former Ambassador to Argentina), (6) Minister to Venezuela: Le Biche (former Minister to Siam), (7) Minister to Cuba: Barrois (former Minister to Venezuela), (8) Minister to Colombia: Elouis (former Counselor at the Swiss Embassy), (9) Minister to Paraguay: Messiaen. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

### Churchill Reports on War Situation in House of Commons, Says Although Belgian King Has Succumbed to Germany, Allied Forces Are Fighting

London Prime Minister Churchill announced in the House of Commons today that King Leopold of Belgium had succumbed to Germany. The Belgian cabinet did not approve of this move and has declared its determination to continue fighting on the side of the Allies. The crowd cheered loudly upon hearing this. The House of Commons was packed today, and the atmosphere was extremely tense when the Prime Minister stood up to speak. Every seat in the diplomatic gallery was occupied. The ambassadors of the Soviet Union, Brazil, Turkey, and the United States were all present.

The Prime Minister informed the House of Commons that the Belgian King had sent a plenipotentiary to the German headquarters yesterday to request a cessation of hostilities on the Belgian front. The British and French governments have instructed their front-line generals to immediately refrain from participating in such actions and to persist in the campaign they are currently engaged in. However, the German commander has accepted the Belgian King's proposal, and Belgium ceased hostilities at four o'clock this morning. The Belgian army fought very bravely and suffered heavy losses. The Belgian government has not approved of its monarch's actions and has announced today that it is the sole government of Belgium and has formally declared its determination to continue fighting on the side of the Allies, as the Allies had sent troops to aid Belgium at its urgent request. Whatever our emotions may be, based on the facts we already know, we must remember the many people under the power of the invaders and those compatriots who are still resisting the invaders and fulfilling their duties in better days than we are currently experiencing. The surrender of the Belgian army greatly increases the danger to the British and French armies currently engaged in fierce fighting in France. However, the British and French armies are now in good spirits and are fighting with the utmost discipline and courage. I must, of course, avoid mentioning the details of the work that the British and French armies are currently carrying out or hoping to carry out with the powerful assistance of the Royal Navy and Air Force. I hope to report on the general situation in my next statement, when the results of the intense fighting currently underway can be further assessed. However, a larger assessment must wait until next week. In the meantime, the House of Commons should prepare to deal with difficult and momentous events. I must reiterate that nothing that has happened in this great war can diminish our own responsibility to defend world values ​​(the crowd cheers), nor should it undermine our confidence in our ability to advance, for we have also experienced disasters and anxieties in our past history, but we have always defeated our enemies.

After the Prime Minister finished his statement, Smith, representing the Labor Party, thanked the Prime Minister for his statement, saying that because the Prime Minister will continue to make statements next week, there is no time to make any discussion now. I myself will hold on to one point, that no matter what the Prime Minister has to tell us in the next few days, weeks, or months, we have not yet touched the edge of our country's determination. Then Harris, representing the Liberal Party, gave a speech praising the army that defends world freedom, saying that our feelings and confidence are placed in them. (The crowd cheers) (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

(Haitong dispatch, 28th)

### British Air Force Disrupts German Transportation Lines, German Troops Near Boloye Suffer Heavy Losses

London The Information Section of the Aviation Ministry stated that British bombers were active on Sunday night, disrupting railway and river traffic in a vast area from the Rhineland to the French border. The record of one heavy bomber can represent the achievements of the remaining aircraft. The aircraft dropped bombs on a mechanized column near Brussels within half an hour, destroying and using machine guns to extinguish searchlights. It also destroyed a railway line and a bridge. It dropped three bombs on a hillside, destroying a machine gun position. Other bombers dropped bombs on the railway south of Aachen, damaging a railway intersection in Belgium. Bombs also fell in the forest near the area, emitting unusually loud explosions, which seemed to have hit an ammunition depot. Two heavy bombers attacked an enemy transport team of twenty-four vehicles, which caught fire after two violent explosions. The fire illuminated the countryside for miles. On Sunday, the British Air Force made night attacks on the airfields of Flurange, Brussels, and Antwerp, and continued to attack German transport in Belgium and western Germany. Railway intersections, branch lines, and armored trains were hit. Medium bombers bombed enemy mechanized vehicles gathered near Boloye, causing heavy losses. Various targets in the province of Flandres were also bombed. It is reported that twenty-three German aircraft were destroyed or severely damaged by British aircraft yesterday, and a British patrol shot down five German bombers. Five British fighters are missing. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

### Continued Changes Among British Generals, Haining Appointed Deputy Chief of the Army General Staff, Jackson Appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Western Command

London The British War Office announced that Lieutenant General Haining, Commander-in-Chief of the Western Command, has been appointed Deputy Chief of the Army General Staff to succeed General Dill, who has been transferred to Chief of the General Staff. General Jackson has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Southwestern Command. Major General Fegit, commander of the 18th Division, has been appointed Chief of Staff of the Home Guard and granted the rank of Lieutenant General. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

London The Times published an article welcoming Sir Ironside's appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Home Guard, but argued for the establishment of a position with greater powers to unify and centralize authority. The article stated that a very simple response has shown that the various activities of the Home Guard must be linked together. The purpose and policy of the home defense command must be unified, and there should be a powerful and united staff to command the army, navy, and air force, coastal auxiliary defense, civilian defense committees, police, and local defense volunteers. It should be directly responsible to the Minister of Defense, that is, the Prime Minister. With preparations made in this sense, the danger of excessive concentration in the British Isles cannot and must not be tolerated. The primary objective of greater security for the base is greater security for overseas operations. This is the only proper way to pay attention. The island cannot be made exempt from the various hazards of modern warfare, nor is it expected to be exempt. Its people have bravely expressed their willingness to fulfill their respective responsibilities, knowing that passive defense cannot win victory, and knowing that increasing precautions for the safety of individuals or land is only a way to fully develop industrial, naval, and army power so as to actively overthrow the enemy. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

### More Than One Hundred Japanese Aircraft Formally Attack Chongqing, Dropping Bombs on Densely Populated Areas, Foreign Embassies Also Affected, Rumors of Five Being Shot Down by Chinese Forces

Chongqing On the 28th, Japanese aircraft attacked Chongqing in three waves. The first wave consisted of thirty-six aircraft, the second wave twenty-six, and the third wave sixteen, plus several reconnaissance aircraft. They successively invaded Sichuan via Shili Pu, Jianshi, and Mianyang in Hubei Province, dropping more than one hundred and sixty explosive and incendiary bombs in the vicinity of Chongqing, many of which fell into the water. The city suffered more than two hundred and fifty casualties, and several fires broke out, which were quickly extinguished by the brave and agile firefighters, without spreading. Those injured were quickly dispatched by the various rescue teams to the hospitals for treatment before the all-clear was sounded. When the Japanese aircraft entered the city, they were fiercely attacked by the Chinese air force and artillery. After dropping their bombs, the Japanese aircraft immediately fled eastward. Two of them were damaged by Chinese anti-aircraft guns. Where they crashed is still being sought. The air raid alert was issued in the city at 9:45 a.m., the emergency alert at 10:34 a.m., and the all-clear at 2:40 p.m. (Dispatch, 28th)

Chongqing After one hundred and eight Japanese aircraft dropped five hundred bombs on the densely populated city center today, killing and wounding more than a thousand people and destroying seven hundred houses, it has become a scene of smoke and rubble. This air raid can be described as the most terrifying since May of last year. Swarms of Japanese aircraft continuously dropped bombs on the area within a square mile where government agencies and foreign embassies are located, with the force of rain. The systematic bombing by the Japanese side over the past three days, including today, has resulted in at least two thousand casualties in Chongqing, and has made the hospitals even busier treating the injured. The Soviet and French embassies here have suffered minor damage. The glass windows of the French embassy were shattered, and some of the doors were blown away when the bombs fell twenty-five yards from the embassy. In addition to the damage to the glass windows, the planks of the Soviet embassy were also loosened. Several coolies nearby were killed. The bomb that fell near the Soviet embassy was only twelve yards away from the embassy. Although the bombs fell around the central news agency of the Central News Agency near Chongqing, it was not affected, but a freight car of the agency was destroyed. No foreigners were reported injured in this terrifying air raid. The Japanese aircraft have attacked Sichuan many times this year, and today was the first formal attack on Chongqing. However, most of the houses that were bombed in the city were old sites of government agencies that have already moved elsewhere. (United Press dispatch, 28th)

Chongqing Today's air raid alert here lasted for as long as five hours, and did not end until 3 p.m. According to military observers, 108 Japanese bombers attacked Chongqing in three teams, each team consisting of sixteen aircraft. (United Press dispatch, 28th)

Chongqing Chongqing was bombed today, the fifth time in three days. About one hundred and forty-four Japanese aircraft fiercely bombed Chongqing. The lively area of the old city that was bombed last summer was bombed by Japanese aircraft for the first time today. High-explosive and incendiary bombs were dropped. The Japanese aircraft flew over the city in four batches, each batch of about thirty-six bombers. Two batches dropped bombs in residential areas in the city, and the other two batches concentrated their attacks on the suburbs.

As of this evening, there were no reports of any foreign casualties. However, several bombs fell near the Soviet embassy, ​​and the house outside the courtyard, used as a dormitory for staff, was destroyed. The Japanese aircraft concentrated their bombing on a certain area outside Ximen, which is the best residential area in Chongqing. The foreign embassies (except for the United States and Germany) and foreign reporters all set up offices in this area. The casualties in the area were probably heavy, and several fires broke out. All the windows of the French embassy were shattered, and the occupants of the house were shaken and unable to stand. The press club where the foreign reporters lived was completely collapsed, and two coolies were killed. The Reuters representative and his wife narrowly escaped the disaster. Afterwards, they drove around the bombed areas in the afternoon and saw that most of the casualties were concentrated in two centers, one was the main street of a densely populated village, and the other was a house by the riverbank under a steep mountain. About ten houses along both sides of the main road of the village were completely collapsed. The leader of a rescue team used a loudspeaker to direct the rescue work. The Chinese people were extremely calm. All life in one of the bombed villages is still proceeding as usual. When a truck full of empty coffins and stretchers passed through a village, the Reuters representative witnessed five musicians playing excitedly for a wedding. A factory near the river was partly destroyed. A temporary first-aid station is now set up by the rescue team on the hillside, where the injured are given first aid and then sent to various hospitals by truck. Personnel from the American and French embassies and the British consulate all went to the bombed areas for inspection this afternoon. It was heard that bombs had fallen in the mountains outside Chongqing. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

Captain Hu's courage and skill in battle were highly praised by the officers. (Dispatch, 28th)

The Japanese army was unable to support and scattered in all directions.

Luoyang The fighting in the suburbs of Jincheng is still extremely fierce. Jingangcha Ting and other places are the central points of contention between the Chinese and Japanese forces. Because the Japanese have suffered too many casualties, they have reinforced more than four thousand people for days in a row, holding on to the corner and dying. The Chinese army is currently attacking fiercely. The Japanese troops at Yao Dian, such as Ershilipu Zhoucun (west of Jincheng), are still surrounded and attacked by the Chinese on all sides and cannot advance or retreat.

(Dispatch, 28th)

Luoyang The battle for the outposts surrounding Gaoping is still progressing fiercely. The Chinese army is using the favorable areas in the northeast to advance on the Japanese forces facing them. The encirclement of Gaoping has gradually narrowed. At the same time, the Chinese army is even more active with a large army on the west side of the Changgao Road, cutting off the Japanese transportation line. The Japanese army is feeling extremely difficult to supply. On the morning of the 23rd, the Chinese army once attacked and entered Mishan Town (east of Gaoping), destroying most of the Japanese fortifications.

The Japanese have repeatedly tried to repair them, but they have been fiercely attacked and intercepted by the Chinese army. (Dispatch, 27th)

Xingji In the middle of this month, the Japanese army on the west side of the southern section of the Tongpu Railway launched a large-scale invasion of Xiangning Jixian. After a bloody battle for seven days and nights by the Chinese army in the areas of Hejin Nanbei Wuqin and Mabiyu Sanguan Yuzhongjian, up to three thousand Japanese troops were killed. According to reliable sources, the Japanese infantry captain Umino Sakihe was also killed by the Chinese army. (Dispatch, 27th)

### The Japanese Situation South of Liang Kou is Desperate

Wengyuan: The Japanese forces, who attacked north from Ji Long Gang (Chicken Cage Ridge), were lured by Chinese forces into the area north of Liang Kou, encircled, and fiercely attacked. They suffered another disastrous defeat. On the 26th, Chinese forces from all directions tightened the encirclement and recaptured Liang Kou first. They then fiercely attacked Pingchang, cutting off Japanese reinforcements. The Japanese forces in the area south of Liang Kou are now like turtles in a jar. (28th dispatch)

Wengyuan: After the Chinese forces recaptured Liang Kou, they advanced south in pursuit of their victory. The retreating Japanese forces attempted to resist along the way, but they were met with fierce attacks from the Chinese forces, resulting in many casualties.

### Italy Takes Offensive Against Britain and France; Reaffirms Territorial Demands; Involves Nice for the First Time; Believes the Time is Ripe to Break Free from Shackles; Italian Prime Minister to Formally Declare Attitude Early Next Month

Rome: Authoritative sources stated today that the Italian core cabinet meeting will be convened on June 4th, chaired by Prime Minister Mussolini. Important decisions will be made regarding Italy's position in this European war. Mussolini will explain to the cabinet members the various preparations made by Italy and its military strength. Some expect Mussolini to inform the cabinet whether he will involve Italy in the war. Currently, war enthusiasm is very high throughout Italy. Italian newspapers are inciting nationalist fervor by attacking the Allied powers and publishing news from Berlin about German victories over the British and French forces. Public rallies are strongly advocating participation in the war to satisfy Italy's territorial demands to the Allied powers. (28th United Press dispatch)

Rome: The "Italian News" published an editorial today, declaring, "The knots of Suez, Gibraltar, and the Dardanelles must be untied." The newspaper pointed out that Britain, for the sake of its monopoly policy, is unwilling to hear about the freedom of the Mediterranean. However, Italy is making this call today to safeguard the integrity of its overseas territories and sovereignty, demanding the removal of the shackles imposed by Britain. These shackles are the three locations: Suez, Gibraltar, and the Dardanelles. (28th Huitong dispatch)

Rome: According to reliable sources in Italy, Italian newspapers will intensify their propaganda on territorial demands in the future. The territories demanded are roughly Nice, Corsica, Malta, and Djibouti. The "Podium" newspaper quoted former US President Lincoln yesterday, declaring, "The area of England must be reduced to match its national boundaries. By what right does Britain annex Malta and Gibraltar? This annexation is purely an act of plunder." According to news from various towns, there are demonstrations and marches throughout Italy demanding participation in the war. (28th Huitong dispatch)

Rome: The Fascist Party's "Labor News" recently published an article listing the natural desires of the Italian nation, openly listing the French city of Nice as one of Italy's territorial demands. Observers here generally say that this is the first time that newspapers have mentioned Nice since the outbreak of the current European war. (27th Havas dispatch)

Rome: The "Tavern News" published an editorial today, commenting on Britain's position in the eastern Mediterranean, declaring that the French newspaper believed that the Allied navies only need to grasp the triangle of Alexandria, Cyprus, and Haifa to be unbreakable. It must be known that the most important thing militarily is the Suez Canal, but the Suez Canal is only eleven meters deep. It is easy to block the Suez Canal by sinking a ship. The naval communications of Britain and France in the eastern Mediterranean will be cut off. From Crete to Libya, Italy's naval base is Tobruk. This line is under its control. What is especially important is the comparison of the Italian air force with the air force strength of Britain and France in Egypt, Palestine, and Syria. If Italy moves the air force of Sicily, Libya, and the Dodecanese Islands, then the air force of Britain and France in the above-mentioned areas can be completely destroyed. (28th Huitong dispatch)

### Gibraltar and Malta Impose Curfew; Tunis on Wartime Alert

Gibraltar: Officials announced that Gibraltar will implement a curfew from 11:30 PM to 5:30 AM starting today. Only British military personnel and uniformed personnel are allowed outdoors during curfew hours. Malta also implemented a curfew for the first time yesterday. (28th Reuters dispatch)

Rome: According to news received here, the French authorities in Tunis have banned coffee shops and restaurants from installing wireless radios to avoid listening to Arabic-language reports from German and Italian radio stations on the Western Front. Border guards have been established in Tunis, and French youths who have not yet enlisted must participate in the militia. Several residences of Italian expatriates have been searched, Italian expatriates' letters have been inspected, and Italian newspapers have been confiscated. Government agencies and the British Consulate have been secretly guarded. Those leaving Tunis must obtain a special permit from the military authorities in Algiers, and those residing in Tunis must also obtain a special permit. (28th Huitong dispatch)

### Alexandria Strictly Prevents Espionage; Foreign Schools Searched; Hotel Waitresses Forced to Leave

Alexandria: The Egyptian government today began to deal with the "Fifth Column" organization. More than 40 hotel waitresses of Hungarian, Polish, Spanish, and Soviet nationalities have been expelled from Alexandria. The authorities also conducted large-scale searches for spies in more than 20 schools of British, Italian, Greek, and Egyptian nationalities. (28th United Press dispatch)

### British Government Eagerly Seeks to Improve Relations with the Soviet Union; Sends Left-Wing Leader to the Soviet Union for Negotiations; Roosevelt Plans to Make Another Appeal to Italy

London: Britain sought yesterday to conclude new commercial agreements with Italy and the Soviet Union, seeking to prevent the war from extending to the Mediterranean and the Near East. Last night, it was learned here that the Allied powers are preparing to improve their blockade, granting Italy some convenience, while Italy is exchanging this by guaranteeing that it will not transship imported goods to Germany. It is reported that Italy has expressed its agreement to this. At the same time, well-informed sources said that President Roosevelt may again send a document to Prime Minister Mussolini, proposing to resolve Italy's disputes with the Allied powers on peaceful terms. Earlier this month, Roosevelt sent a letter to Prime Minister Mussolini, requesting to restrain the expansion of the war to the Mediterranean. The British Embassy in Rome continues to advise British expatriates there to leave Italy, but authoritative sources said that this advice is not urgent. Recently, reliable sources said that the British government has decided to select a new ambassador to go to Moscow, replacing Sir Seeds. Sir Seeds asked for leave to return to London earlier this year and has not returned to the Soviet capital. Soviet Ambassador to London Maisky told Foreign Secretary Halifax on Sunday evening that the Soviet Union does not object to a trade delegation led by left-wing leader Sir Cripps, and requested that an ambassador be sent as soon as possible to facilitate negotiations. (28th United Press dispatch)

London: Responsible persons here recently stated that Sir Stafford Cripps, leader of the left wing of the British Labour Party, has gone to Moscow to conduct negotiations with the Soviet authorities. At the same time, Soviet Ambassador Maisky also met with Foreign Secretary Halifax and made several suggestions regarding the resumption of commercial negotiations between the two countries. Once the two governments have agreed with each other, the British commercial delegation can go to Moscow. However, what Sir Cripps and representatives of the Soviet government are discussing is not limited to commercial relations. It can be asserted that this is because the Soviet Union fears that Britain is pursuing an anti-German strategy and will probably request that only Anglo-Soviet relations be discussed, and not relations between the Soviet Union and second countries. In fact, Britain's intention is only to improve Anglo-Soviet relations and stabilize them. (27th Havas dispatch)

London: According to a special dispatch from London, the "Times" criticized the visit of British left-wing leader Sir Stafford Cripps to Moscow, saying that if the Soviet Union helps Germany break the Allied blockade, then the friendship negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union will achieve little or even be ineffective. On the other hand, if Soviet policy is only determined by its own needs, and if it is prepared to conduct transactions that are equally beneficial to its freedom and British interests, then the path to a compromise that is beneficial to both parties may be opened. The first task is to immediately clarify the existing unease regarding this key point. (28th Reuters dispatch)

### The Soviet Union and Yugoslavia Will Take a Step Further; Establish Diplomatic Relations; The Soviet-Yugoslav Agreement Has Been Approved by the Soviet Union; The Two Countries Will Send Commercial Delegations to Each Other

Yugoslav Capital: Italian newspapers have reported that the Soviet delegation will arrive here on the 5th of next month to negotiate the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Responsible persons here have corrected that the Soviet delegation is for the exchange of ratification documents of the commercial agreement. A certain important person from the Soviet Union may take the opportunity to prepare for the establishment of diplomatic relations. (28th Havas dispatch)

Yugoslav Capital: The saying that Yugoslavia will currently recognize the Soviet Union de jure is making a great clamor. The candidate for the first Yugoslav envoy to the Soviet Union will be chosen from either the current envoy to Turkey, Mr. Shumangovich, or the Director-General of the Army, General Maximovich. However, before implementing recognition, some cabinet members of the Yugoslav government must be replaced, and the government's attitude towards the White Russian immigrant issue must also be changed. (27th Havas dispatch)

Moscow: The trade and navigation agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia on May 11, 1940, has been approved by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. (28th TASS dispatch)

Yugoslav Capital: It was recently announced here that the Soviet commercial delegation will come here before mid-June, and the Yugoslav commercial delegation will also go to Moscow at the same time, residing in the capitals of each country. This is in accordance with the provisions of the Soviet-Yugoslav commercial treaty. It is also learned that Yugoslavia will send another diplomatic delegation to Moscow. (28th Huitong dispatch)

### Philippine Immigration Bill; Signed by the Philippine President

Manila: The new immigration bill was signed by President Quezon today. The bill will be sent to Washington for President Roosevelt's approval. Because the bill has not been approved by President Roosevelt, it cannot become law. Observers here believe that President Roosevelt will definitely approve the bill. Political observers predict that, judging from the statement issued by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs last month, Japan will definitely be extremely dissatisfied with this new immigration bill. (28th United Press dispatch)

New York: According to the authoritative "Fortune" magazine, published today in its June issue, one of the most serious problems in recent US foreign policy is that the United States is reconsidering the Philippine immigration law issue. Before the situation in the Sino-Japanese War and the European War has been clarified, the Philippine issue cannot be answered. The magazine also pointed out that although some people in the Philippines are working hard for independence, the United States' attempt to maintain trade routes in the Far East and its concern about Japan's military or economic aggression against the Philippines have made any movement towards independence impossible. (28th United Press dispatch)

### The Allied Powers Need Effective American Assistance; Can Be Seen in the Commentary

London: The "Daily News" published an article commenting on President Roosevelt's speech, saying that all sectors of American opinion have now suddenly awakened to the fact that if Europe is Nazified, it will be harmful to the United States, to a deep and enormous extent. It is not yet possible to predict what the practical consequences will be of the American people's sympathy for the Allied powers' cause. However, neutrality laws, if not in strength, but in spirit, will increasingly become a dead letter. The "Daily Mail" said that the issue of more direct American assistance to the Allied powers seems to depend on the events of the next few weeks. The Allied powers can rely on the United States to provide more material assistance, but the United States does not want to be drawn into the whirlpool of war now. (28th Reuters dispatch)

New York: The "New York Times" published an article by Armstrong, the diplomatic affairs editor currently in Paris, advocating that the United States should give the Allied powers unlimited assistance, including aircraft, food, and medicine, all of which are urgently needed. He said that if the US Army has even one aircraft remaining that can be spared, it should be flown or transported across the Atlantic tomorrow. Although I am not a military commentator, I am sure that the British and French armies can guard their doors, but if the British and French armies want to continue to guard and gather their forces to win the final victory, they must bring our money, our planes, our supplies, our encouragement, and our patronage. (28th Reuters dispatch)

### US Immigration Affairs; Under the Management of the Department of Justice

Will Facilitate the Elimination of Spies

Washington: The United States' method of eliminating the "Fifth Column" has become more convenient yesterday, because the House of Representatives has passed the bill proposed by the President to hand over immigration affairs to the Department of Justice for discussion in the Senate. In addition, the Senate Judiciary Committee also passed a bill that proposes that all foreign nationals residing in the United States should register their fingerprints with the immigration authorities within four months. Authoritative sources said that the act of foreigners leaving fingerprints will make it easier for the authorities to investigate the activities of foreigners in the United States. (28th United Press dispatch)

### Moffat Appointed; US Envoy to Canada

Washington: President Roosevelt has appointed Moffat as the envoy to Canada. Moffat is currently the Director of the European Division of the State Department and recently accompanied Undersecretary of State Welles to Europe. (28th Reuters dispatch)

### The Soviet Union Has Absolutely No Intention of Interfering in the Dutch East Indies; Soviet Government Organ Denies Rumors Solemnly

Moscow: The Chicago "Daily News" published a message the other day, saying that representatives of Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union held a meeting in Beiping to discuss the "fate of the Dutch East Indies." The Soviet government organ Izvestia published an article today to correct this, saying, "Those capitalist newspaper lackeys are spreading rumors, pointing out that the Soviet Union has certain intentions towards the Dutch East Indies. In fact, this kind of trick is enough to prove that these people's masters have decided to plunder this Dutch territory. Those capitalist newspapers and diplomats often accuse others in order to divert attention and cover up their own acts of theft. This habit has been around for a long time." (7th Havas dispatch)

### Japan is Watching the Development of the European Situation

Tokyo: Although some well-informed Japanese people are now watching the development of the European situation with great concern, they are debating whether it is in Japan's interest for Germany to dominate Western Europe in the future and combine with the equally self-interested Soviet Union to control Eastern Europe. However, the more right-leaning nationalists believe that if the United States and Italy are drawn into the whirlpool of war, it will be a great opportunity for Japan, not only to consolidate its hegemony in East Asia, but also to have far-reaching ambitions. Therefore, they urge the government to abandon the so-called "non-involvement in the European War" policy and expand cooperation to build a new order in the world. Suma, the director of the Information Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recently delivered a broadcast speech, aiming to make the general public of Japan understand the official opinions of the Japanese diplomatic authorities and to explain the situation slightly. He said that Japan's declaration on maintaining the political and economic status quo of the East Indies has nothing to do with the Four-Power Treaty. The production of this declaration is due to Japan's determination to prevent the European War from spreading to Asia. This is the greatest result of its policy of non-involvement in the European War. Suma also said, "We deeply believe that the policy of non-involvement in the European War itself must be a kind of spiritual preparation for large-scale participation in the future. Therefore, because of the policy of non-involvement, can Japan not participate greatly when the light finally shines on the world?" The "Yomiuri Shimbun" believes that the meaning of this statement is that Japan intends to prepare spiritually for future participation when the world situation changes and is necessary.

Yangon: The implementation of the air defense plan is almost complete.

The authorities used leaflets to advise the public to pay attention to air defense, and they have purchased fire trucks and allocated them to the Yangon Central Fire Brigade, and they will continue to purchase more. Other preparations such as anti-gas measures are also underway. Disinfection stations will be set up in each police district, and many people have volunteered to become air defense personnel and have already been trained, but another 300 people are still needed. The organization of demolition and rescue teams is also under consideration. The Air Defense Committee originally planned to test the lighting control a few days ago, but it was temporarily suspended due to disturbances by Indian-Burmese Muslims. (28th Reuters dispatch)

### Japan Actively Arranges to Advance South; Builds Supply Stations on Small Islands in Fujian and Guangdong; Various Warships Go to Taiwan One After Another for Re-Equipment

Shantou Correspondence: Recently, Japan has been very active in arranging to advance south. It is said that the commander-in-chief of the Japanese fleet stationed in China has been replaced by the tactician Shimada Jielang. There is a rumor that the Governor-General of Taiwan will be concurrently held by a certain current Admiral. The Xiamen large airport was completed in May, and the air force base on Hainan Island is equally grand in scale. Small islands along the coast of Fujian and Guangdong, such as Jinmen, Nan'ao, Zhou, and Sanzao, are equipped with air force supply stations and ports and docks for naval vessels to obtain coal and provisions. There are agencies in Guangzhou and Chaoshan that recruit workers and soldiers, using various methods to lure hungry youths to work on the islands. From last year until now, countless people have gone and never returned. Recently, the Japanese Third and Fourth Fleets along the coast of Guangdong and Shantou, commanded by Takashi Shiro, commander of the South China Fleet, were transferred back to the Magong naval base in Taiwan to re-equip with large cannons. The second-class cruisers Tenryu, Kuryuu, Ryusyo, and the destroyers Hayate, Oite, and Kamikaze, a total of eleven ships, sailed through Shantou to Taiwan in succession on the 15th. The aviation supply ship Kamoi, near Hainan Island, is berthed in Sanya Port, and the new-style aircraft carrier Chiyoda has also returned to Taiwan. According to military sources, the concentration of Japanese naval forces back to Taiwan indicates new actions, but it must be related to the southward advance policy.

### Jinhua City District Implements Grain Rationing

Good Results from Implementation

Jinhua Dispatch: The Zhejiang Provincial Government, to coordinate and regulate the food supply in various counties, decided that Jinhua County's urban area should be the first to implement a grain rationing system. On April 29th, the Jinhua Grain Rationing General Mobilization Headquarters was established at the Fourth District Commissioner's Office. Xuan Tiewu, the Security Chief, was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief; Li Chu Kuang, the Fourth District Commissioner; and Zhu Huiqing, the Deputy Director of the Provincial Grain Management Office, were appointed as Deputy Commanders. Xu Xuebin, the Magistrate of Jinhua County, served as the Executive Director. The headquarters set up three groups: General Affairs, Investigation, and Control. Personnel were transferred from various agencies to work there. After active preparations, a general mobilization training session on grain rationing was held, convening the heads of villages and towns throughout the county for training. Huang Shaoxiong, the Provincial Chairman, also personally delivered a speech on the essentials of grain rationing and dispatched political work teams to busy streets and public gathering places to promote the system. An investigation team was organized, with County Magistrate Xu as the Chief Captain, under which were four brigades. The heads of villages and towns, as well as officials from various agencies, served as investigators. On May 7th, at 3:00 AM, a cannon was fired to begin the general mobilization to investigate the population and grain reserves in the urban area. Thanks to thorough preparation, the investigation was completed by 6:00 AM. All brigade and team districts filled out grain purchase certificates based on the grain ration investigation forms at designated locations, and the heads of villages were responsible for distributing them to residents. Grain rationing was implemented starting on the 9th, at the grain public stores established by the County Grain Management Office, which had fourteen branches. All branches opened for business at 5:00 AM on the 9th. The public purchased grain with their certificates enthusiastically, and the order was good. The business hours of each store were from 5:00 AM to 8:00 AM and from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM. The selling price of rice was seven catties per yuan. In total, 526 dan and 38 catties of rice were sold in one day. That evening, a daily report was prepared along with the rice money, which was sent to the Grain Management Office for deposit in the bank. It is planned to promote the system in other counties as well. The provincial government has scheduled a grain conference on the 10th, convening the magistrates of twenty-four counties to discuss the gradual implementation.

### Two Puppet Officials in Dinghai Shot Dead by Strong Men

One was the Puppet Secretary-General, the other was the Puppet Section Chief

Dinghai Dispatch: Daishan Island, which belongs to the county and is a famous local product of eastern Zhejiang, has been exploited by local gentry such as Gao Asheng, who formed a puppet autonomous association after the island fell in May of last year, taking advantage of the situation to exploit the common people. Fei Pengruo, the Secretary-General of the Puppet Special Autonomous Committee of Dongsha Bureau, was the worst, and the people hated him to the bone. A few days ago, three men went to the Huang residence in Daijia Lane, under Yangfu Palace in Jiban Sha, and asked if Mr. Shi Bao (Shi Bao was Fei's childhood name) was at home. The maid in the house, not knowing who they were, opened the door to welcome them. One of the three men stood guard outside the door, while the other two entered the house. They went to the bedroom door and kicked it open. Fei was sitting on the bed. Seeing the fierce appearance of the men, he knew something was wrong, but he still relied on his courage and said to the men, "What's the matter with you? Why don't we talk it over?" He even tried to curry favor by showing them the gold ring and cash in his wallet. However, the men threw his wallet on the ground and immediately pulled out a pistol and shot Fei in the chest. With a loud bang, he was fatally wounded, and Fei died instantly. Seeing that their mission was accomplished, the two men left with the man guarding the door. When the Puppet Special Autonomous Association of Dongsha Corner received the news, they immediately reported it to the Japanese commander stationed in Daishan and the public security branch, and searched everywhere, but to no avail.

Another report: Cai Linshu, the Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Puppet Special Autonomous Association in the county seat, was riding his bicycle home from the puppet association the other day when he was passing the bamboo fence between Xinshun and the noodle shop at Banlu Pavilion outside the South Gate. Suddenly, a strong man wearing a lotus cloth short shirt and pants, and a copper basin-style felt hat, called out from behind, "Mr. Cai, where are you going?" Cai stopped his bicycle and turned around. The man suddenly pulled out a pistol and shot Cai. The bullet went through his ear and Cai fell to the ground and died. Seeing that his goal was achieved, the patriot ran towards Hujia Bridge and disappeared in the direction of the East Gate.

### People of Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, and Henan Declare "Not to be Slaves," Cherishing the Great Aspiration of Self-Salvation and Saving Others, Preserving the Personality of All Humanity

Xuzhou Dispatch: The people in the border area of Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, and Henan have always been known for their strength and a strong sense of national identity. Although their land has been occupied, the people, unwilling to be slaves, have risen up and flocked to resist the war with great enthusiasm. Recently, declarations of the "Not to be Slaves Grand Alliance" have been found in various counties, cities, towns, and villages in the area, stating that they are fighting for personality, and anyone who insults personality will be regarded as the great enemy of all the people. The declaration is recorded below to show a glimpse of the people's spirit. The text says, "The Not to be Slaves Grand Alliance solemnly declares in all sincerity that all people who swear not to be slaves must strictly abide by the articles of not being slaves, encourage each other, firmly defend the front line of not being slaves, and never waver. Confucius said, 'Since ancient times, everyone has died, but the people cannot stand without trust. Do not seek life at the expense of benevolence, but sacrifice life to achieve benevolence.' Mencius said, 'The ambitious do not forget that they may die in a ditch, and the brave do not forget that they may lose their heads.' The things they desire are greater than life, and the things they hate are greater than death. These words are all excellent teachings for the people of our country to cope with the current difficulties. Those who willingly be slaves have already fallen into hell and are not worth helping. Those who have become slaves involuntarily are earnestly hoped to extricate themselves in time and return quickly. This Grand Alliance does not blame the past and will treat them all equally without discrimination. This Grand Alliance cherishes the great aspiration of self-salvation and saving others, not only to preserve the personality of the 450 million people of China but also to preserve the personality of the 2 billion people of the world. Anyone who is human will be regarded as a good teacher and helpful friend once they swear not to be slaves. Alas, extend oneself to others, spirits attract each other and voices respond to each other, with the same aspirations and common goals, emphasizing spirit over form. This Grand Alliance regards those who insult personality as the great enemy of all the people, and those who abandon personality as the scum of all the people. We swear not to share the world with them and are determined to eradicate evil, persisting until all evils are exterminated and justice prevails. This declaration is hereby issued as a proclamation."

### Regulations for the Examination of Academic Performance of Students Above the Junior College Level - The Ministry of Education Stipulates Six Items to be Implemented

(Chongqing News Agency): The Ministry of Education believes that although the level of students in schools above the junior college level has slightly improved compared to the past, the development in quality of various schools above the junior college level has not fully corresponded with the development in quantity. In order to improve the level of students in schools above the junior college level and seek to improve the quality of higher education, the Ministry of Education has specially formulated regulations for the examination of academic performance of students in schools above the junior college level and issued a notice to various schools above the junior college level that, starting from this semester, each school should strictly implement the various regulations. The key points of the regulations are as follows: (1) At least one impromptu test must be held each semester. The test papers should be properly kept by the school, and the Ministry may order them to be reviewed at any time within one year or review them during inspections according to the curriculum. (2) Students' usual lecture notes, reading notes, and reports on exercises, awards, and experiments should be combined and calculated separately from the impromptu tests as usual grades. The method of review is the same as in the previous article. (3) Semester exams should be strictly implemented at the end of each semester and should not be held in advance. The results of the semester exams must be combined with the usual grades and calculated as the semester grade. The semester exam grades in the preceding paragraph must be registered and submitted to the Ministry for verification at the end of the semester in accordance with the regulations, and the Ministry may randomly review the test papers of a certain subject at any time. (4) Students who fail a subject in the semester exam with a score of 40 or more but less than 60 may be given a supplementary exam, but only once. Those who score less than 40 are not allowed to take a supplementary exam and should be ordered to repeat the course. If the number of credits for the failed subjects exceeds one-third of the total number of credits taken in that semester, the student should be ordered to repeat the grade. If it exceeds one-half, the student should be ordered to withdraw from school. (5) The graduation exam is changed to a general exam system. In addition to testing at least four subjects in the last semester for universities and five subjects for junior colleges and specialized courses, at least two of which (three for junior colleges and specialized courses) must include the entire year's curriculum, students must also be tested on at least three major specialized subjects studied in their current grade. Those who fail will not be allowed to graduate. The subjects for the graduation exam in the preceding paragraph must be reported to the Ministry for approval when submitting the list of graduating students.

### Finance: Chinese Merchants Again Buying Foreign Exchange

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in listed exchange rates. The British exchange rate in the unofficial market initially rose but later tightened, with a slight softening trend. This was mainly due to the month-end effect, with more short positions being covered, resulting in less liquidity compared to previous days. Today, the rumor of nearing British-Italian negotiations (possibly referring to discussions on contraband control) further deterred sellers. Unaffiliated trading was inconsistent. Chinese merchants were the most active buyers throughout the day, while Chinese banks occasionally sold in the morning and afternoon, but in small amounts. The market outlook once appeared quite soft, with the U.S. exchange rate reaching 5.4375 yuan, but it rebounded to even at closing. The closing rates were 4 shillings and 1.09375 pence for British gold and 5.46875 yuan for the U.S. dollar, with the British exchange rate tightening by 0.015625 and the U.S. exchange rate softening by 0.0625 compared to the previous day. The futures trend was similar to the spot market.

Unaffiliated Trading in British and U.S. Exchange Rates

The morning began with London Telegraphic Transfers (T/T) down 1.15 for near-term and 0.375 for far-term. New York silver prices remained steady, and London raw gold was unchanged. Exchange rates for Shanghai against British, U.S., French, and other currencies were all steady. The U.S. exchange rate against the British pound fell by 0.0625, remained unchanged against Shanghai, and decreased by 0.0625 against the French franc. Central Bank listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened the morning with spot selling prices of 4 shillings and 1.125 pence for British gold and 5.5 yuan for the U.S. dollar, which was unchanged for the British pound and tightened by 0.03125 for the U.S. dollar compared to the previous day's closing. The market saw slight price fluctuations after opening, but foreign banks' activities were inconsistent. Initially, Chartered Bank sold February British gold at 4 shillings, followed by Banque Belge pour l'Étranger absorbing May U.S. dollars at 5.53125 yuan. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's (HSBC) listed rates were unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced to be reduced by 0.75%. Subsequently, unaffiliated traders engaged in British-U.S. exchange rate swaps, priced at 5.53125 yuan and 4 shillings and 1.125 pence, approximately equivalent to 3.21 yuan. After 10:30 a.m., Chinese speculators slightly increased their buying, leading to a more stable market trend. The Chinese banks, East Asia Bank, initially sold June U.S. dollars at 5.28125 yuan and 1.115 to Chinese speculators. At that time, the rumor of nearing British-Italian negotiations caused a sharp rise in open market prices, attracting many to close positions, while sellers hesitated. By the afternoon, British gold was priced at 4 shillings and 1.09375 pence, and the U.S. dollar at 5.46 yuan, but closing positions were still difficult. June British gold was priced at 3 shillings and 0.953125 pence, and the U.S. dollar at 5.21875 yuan, with spot British softening by 0.015625 and the U.S. tightening by 0.03125 compared to the morning. Futures also contracted.

Far-Term British and U.S. Market Conditions Were Especially Tight

The afternoon opened with conditions similar to the morning. Speculators once bought June U.S. dollars from Chinese banks at 5.21875 yuan. Subsequently, due to sellers' hesitation, particularly with the imbalance between supply and demand for spot U.S. dollars, the rate softened to 5.4375 yuan. However, before the evening close, the market returned to even due to quiet trading, resulting in prices comparable to the afternoon close. Spot British gold was at 4 shillings and 1.09375 pence, and the U.S. dollar at 5.46875 yuan. June British gold was at 3 shillings and 0.953125 pence, and the U.S. dollar at 5.21875 yuan, with spot British tightening by 0.015625 and the U.S. softening by 0.0625 compared to the previous day. June British contracted by 0.015625, and the U.S. also tightened by 0.0625.

### Gold Market: New Long Positions Active, Gold Prices Surge, Breaking the 6,000 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's open market conditions for gold were agitated, with a lively and strong market. High prices were repeatedly seen, especially in the afternoon, where the bullish trend sharply broke through the 6,000 yuan mark. This was due to strong positive sentiment, a softening exchange market trend, and aggressive buying by major Hong Kong players. New long positions also became active again. The morning opened at 5,805 yuan, already 10 yuan higher than the previous day. However, continuous selling from the Tianjin group prevented prices from rising in a straight line, despite bullish sentiment. Subsequently, purchases by securities firms and the start of buying by the Hong Kong group led to a rise. The afternoon close was already at 5,930 yuan. The afternoon opened by jumping to 5,980 yuan. Before long, many retail investors took profits at high prices, but this only lowered the price by 20 yuan. Unexpectedly, a second wave of buying pushed the price to 6,030 yuan, resulting in a closing price of 6,020 yuan, a surge of 225 yuan compared to the previous day. Total trading volume was approximately 3,000 taels. Gold jewelry shops increased prices by 30 yuan, while customs gold prices remained steady.

Gold Jumps 225 Yuan

Since the morning opening, sentiment was firm. Gold shops initially traded 20 taels among themselves at 5,805 yuan, raising the price by 10 yuan compared to the previous day. Subsequently, aggressive buying by a money exchange firm and securities firms, despite repeated selling by gold shops, resulted in demand exceeding supply, and the price hovered between 5,820 and 5,830 yuan. Before long, the gold shops' willingness to sell diminished, and silver shops and retail investors followed the trend, pushing the price to 5,900 yuan. At that time, the money exchange firm took profits, and buyers gradually disappeared, causing a drop of 40 yuan. The money exchange firm sold 50 taels to the securities firm at 5,860 yuan. Although retail investors also sold at that time, they were all absorbed by the firm, and they felt a shortage, so the market was once stagnant. However, before long, a silver shop bought on behalf of the Hong Kong group, causing the price to rise again to the 5,900 yuan mark. At that time, gold shops and silver shops also competed to buy, and the exchange market was also reported to be softening, leading to a disappearance of sellers and a sudden jump of 40 yuan. Silver shops traded 20 taels among themselves at 5,940 yuan. As closing approached, buyers gradually dispersed, resulting in a small drop of 10 yuan. The gold shop sold 10 taels to the silver shop at 5,930 yuan for the afternoon closing price. After the close, the market was firmer due to strong demand from a silver shop, and a small number of transactions opened at 5,945 yuan. The atmosphere was even better when the afternoon opened, jumping by 5,000 yuan. The silver shop bought 30 taels from the gold shop at 5,980 yuan. Subsequently, due to the gold shop selling, there was a slight pullback, with silver shops trading 10 taels against each other at 5,960 yuan. Then, a money exchange firm seized the opportunity to aggressively buy, and securities firms also rushed to buy, causing another jump of 70 yuan. The gold shop sold 10 taels to the securities firm at 6,030 yuan. Later, with no buyers in sight, the gold and silver shops took profits, immediately falling back by 65 yuan. The money exchange firm sold 20 taels to the silver shop at 5,965 yuan. After that, the exchange market was reported to be softening, and a silver shop bought on behalf of the Hong Kong group, while silver shops and securities firms also bought. The price rose again to a high of 6,030 yuan. Then, the money exchange firm sold 30 taels to the gold shop at 6,020 yuan for the evening closing price, resulting in a surge of 225 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 225 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the gold shop's own brand gold was more than 10 yuan higher than the gold price, while the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

Gold Jewelry Also Increased by 30 Yuan

The initial price for gold jewelry at major silver shops was still 590 yuan per tael. At 9:40 a.m., it increased by 10 yuan, and at 11:50 a.m., it increased by another 10 yuan. At 4:00 p.m., it increased by another 10 yuan, resulting in major silver shops raising prices to 620 yuan. The prices at newer silver shops were the same, with the purchase price reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Rise, Especially British and U.S. Gold Pounds

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw gold breaking through the 6,000 yuan mark after being bought up by Hong Kong players. British and U.S. gold pounds, with this support, rapidly rebounded in price. U.S. dollar drafts once rose to 18.38 yuan in the afternoon, eventually settling at 18.30 yuan, an increase of 0.40 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong dollar drafts rose in the afternoon but returned to even. French franc drafts had balanced supply and demand, and the market price was stable. Annam, Robi, Philippines, etc. were in demand, and market prices rose uniformly. Japanese gold drafts remained in demand, continuing to rise to 1.195 yuan in the evening. Korean drafts had balanced supply and demand, remaining at 0.965 yuan in the evening.

### London Telegraphic Transfers Plunge, U.S. Silver Reports Gains

London, 27th Dispatch: The London silver market saw near-term telegraphic transfers (T/T) falling by 1.125 and far-term plunging by 4.375. This was due to India selling far-term, with spot trading being less and prices being even. After closing, India slightly covered short positions, resulting in small trades. New York Dispatch: The long-stagnant U.S. silver price suddenly gained 0.0625, reaching 0.35375 yuan. Bombay Dispatch: Indian silver spot and near-term rose by 0.09 anna, and far-term rose by 0.10 anna. Market conditions were stable, and trading was active, totaling 500 contracts.

### Discount Rates Rise Initially, Then Fall Back

Yesterday's discount rates for exchange drafts rose initially and then fell back. The morning discount rate for every 1,000 yuan rose to 140 yuan, then hovered around 137.5 yuan. In the afternoon, it declined slightly to 132 yuan, the same as the previous day's rate. The Money Exchange Association's interest rate for both the morning and afternoon markets was 0.27, slightly lower by 0.01 compared to the previous day.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Trading Sluggish, Foreign Stocks Perform Better

Yesterday's unofficial securities market did not see an increase in trading. Market conditions were relatively strong, but there were no significant changes in the underlying environment, so the market remained stagnant. Trading was extremely scarce in the morning, with Ding and Wu bonds not being traded at all. The afternoon was relatively active, but there were still no major transactions. Market conditions were mostly waiting for the development of the situation. Scattered retail investors made some small transactions in the morning. In the afternoon, Jiufeng covered short positions, and numbers 12 and 20 bought Wu bonds. Runli also made some covering purchases. Only numbers 38 and Shengda offered some shares on the market. As a result, market prices, except for Bing bonds which fell slightly by 0.05, mostly improved slightly by about 0.10. Turnover was approximately 400,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below.

Stock Transactions: 20 shares of Chenghua Bank were traded at a price of 55 yuan.

Also, the Public Securities Exchange reported that the sentiment in yesterday's stock market was difficult to explain. Perhaps concerns about the development of the situation in Europe have lessened, and buyers suddenly started buying, causing prices to rise rapidly. The volume of transactions was significant, and most stocks closed at high prices. It is said that Hong Kong buyers participated in the activity. It is unknown whether this is true or to what extent this trend will develop.

British shipping stocks were the most popular, with a turnover of 56,200 shares. Opening at 30.25 yuan, they rarely experienced pullbacks. In the afternoon, they were pushed to a high of 35.50 yuan before experiencing a reaction, and the closing price was 32.25 yuan. International stocks were also in good demand, with the former rising from 13.70 yuan to 15.50 yuan and the latter rising from 9.85 yuan to 11.90 yuan. China stocks were also popular, with frequent transactions. The lowest price was 8.30 yuan, and the highest was 9 yuan. Jardine Matheson stocks were bought throughout the day, reaching a high of 44 yuan and closing at 42 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan compared to the previous day.

Rubber stock prices also rose. Java company stocks were in greater demand, and sentiment seems to have recovered slightly.

London, 27th (Monday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt fell again. The top-tier British-German Continued (British-issued) and Rehabilitation (British-issued) loans each fell by 2 pounds, with the former at 45 pounds and the latter at 26 pounds. Crisp Loan fell by 1 pound to 17 pounds. The lower-tier Beining-Huguang (non-German-issued and German-issued), Jinghu, and other railway bonds each fell by 2 pounds, with Beining at 58 pounds, Huguang non-German-issued at 14 pounds, German-issued at 11 pounds, and Jinghu at 15 pounds. Guangjiu fell by 1 pound to 9 pounds, while the rest remained unchanged.

London, 27th (Monday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for British Far East company stocks were generally stable, with only slight fluctuations in HSBC shares. The British-registered shares rose by 0.5 pounds to 83 pounds, while the Hong Kong-registered shares fell by 2 pounds to 82 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: Guangdong Merchants Buying Spot Shuang Ma, Hedging with June Futures

The yarn market continued to rise, due to recent strong demand for 10-count coarse yarn from Guangdong merchants, which boosted sentiment. Speculators became active again, resulting in a two-day rise. June 20-count Shuang Ma futures have risen to over 1,400 yuan. It is said that Guangdong merchants are buying spot Shuang Ma with warehouse receipts and hedging with June futures, but their strategy is unknown.

Spot yarn opened in the morning, continuing the previous day's firm tone. 20-count Shuang Ma was priced at 1,325 yuan, down slightly by 5 yuan. It was then rumored that Hong Kong merchants were still interested in 10-count yarn, boosting sentiment, and 20-count Shuang Ma rose to 1,355 yuan at closing. A total of 1,515 bales were traded in half a day, with 20-count Shuang Ma rising by 50 yuan. Today, 3,060 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong and 1,675 pieces to Guangzhou Bay. The amount purchased by each group is listed below:

Fellow Traders 920 Inland 10

Hong Kong 365 Yunnan 205

Total 1,515

### Indian Cotton Traders Gradually Becoming Active

Cotton trading remained sparse, but Indian cotton traders were gradually becoming active, so the situation appeared more stable. The spot cotton trading situation is listed below:

22.00

Oomra 209.00 Fellow Traders Buying 400 Pieces

208.00

Indian Cotton 208.50 Also 100 Pieces

Mitterling 293.00 Also 1,200 Pieces

Fine Velvet Flower 225.00 Also 90 Pieces

Dhollerah 216.00 Also 100 Pieces

Large quantities of American cotton arrived. Yesterday, the American ship Liberator arrived with over 300 tons, docking at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong to unload. It is reported that the British firm Jardine Matheson's ship Nordal will arrive in Shanghai from the U.S. today with a large batch of 20,000 pieces of American cotton, also scheduled to dock at Qichang Warehouse to unload.

Another report is that the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, was particularly firm and quite active in the morning. There were many fellow traders buying, and some short covering, resulting in closing market prices rising by 15-16 pounds. The Indian cotton market rose by 4 pounds, including forecasts.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market has recently improved, but due to extremely tight credit, trading is very slow. According to the current trend, everyone is optimistic after the end of the month, because Tianjin merchants and Qingdao merchants have recently shown strong buying intentions. The following are the futures prices for factory delivery, converted at a U.S. exchange rate of 5.5 yuan:

20 Count American Mitterling 205.95

Also Also Lower Grade 295.80

32 Count Also 326.70

Also Also Lower Grade 317.00

42 Count Also 330.20

Also Also Lower Grade 320.50

### Piece Goods: Coarse Cloth Sales Expand, Eastern Cloth Prices Also Rise Sharply

Domestic Cloth: Yesterday's market saw rising yarn prices, slightly expanding sales of coarse cloth, which boosted sentiment. Sales were slightly improving, and the market was stable. Hand goods selling prices were gradually approaching market prices. White cloth coarse and fine cloth each rose by 0.25 to 0.50 yuan per piece, dyed cloth rose by 0.50 yuan. Fellow traders traded over 600 pieces, while Ningbo and Yongbo merchants bought over 200 pieces of dyed cloth and twill. Guangdong merchants bought over 100 pieces. Retail and wholesale business in the street was still very quiet, but inventories were piling up, and the number of dyeing and weaving factories that stopped work continued to increase.

Eastern Cloth: As the delivery period for this month passed, many long positions from both inside and outside the industry absorbed, and the market atmosphere rose. White cloth Longtou spun silk closed in the morning market at 40.60 yuan, and Sijunzi serge at 1.08 yuan. Later, there was news that standard gold had increased, further strengthening the situation. Outside the market, trading was calling for 42 yuan, 45 yuan for the next month. Serge spot was also raised to 1.15 yuan, with a tendency to continue rising.

Exports: Today (29th) there were 150 pieces of piece goods shipped to Yantai, 450 pieces to Hong Kong, 140 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 23 pieces to Haikou, and 130 pieces to Haiphong. There were also 296 boxes of woollen yarn arrived from Tianjin and 118 boxes of woollen fabrics from Hong Kong.

### Food: Foreign Rice Supply to Shanghai Interrupted

Market Outlook Difficult to Improve, Glutinous Rice Sales Strong

The rice market remained mediocre yesterday. The morning market saw a brief softening, but it then recovered, with fluctuations of only 0.20 to 0.30 yuan. Most people were closing positions as the Dragon Boat Festival approached, and speculative trading had dissipated. Except for inland merchants from Zhejiang Province such as Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Hangzhou, who were transporting and purchasing rice due to the drought caused by lack of rain during the rice transplanting period, local shops were deserted. Although those with goods saw that inventories were low, they hoped to raise prices, but due to tight credit, their willingness to sell was still loose. Therefore, although speculators sought to clear their positions in the early market, the result was that the market returned to its original level as soon as customer sales moved.

Foreign rice continued to be purchased by merchants from various Zhejiang provinces. As gold prices rebounded and sentiment improved, prices rose steadily after the market opened. Xiao Jiao rice opened in the early market at 47.80 yuan, reached 48 yuan at the afternoon close, opened at 48.50 yuan in the afternoon, rose to 49 yuan, and closed at 48.70 yuan. Although other rice types were not as active as Xiao Jiao rice, prices gradually improved, rising by 0.60 to 0.70 yuan compared to the previous night. Number 2 rice had two batches of transactions at 56 yuan and 56.50 yuan. Spot British China's office offered 59 yuan, approximately 40-50 tons. Spot transactions were due to continued purchases from Zhejiang merchants, totaling over 7,000 bags.

Another report is that foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, Taikoo Dockyard's Jiangsu ship arrived, carrying 2,727 bags from Hong Kong. It is reported that since last week, foreign rice imports have been continuous, although in small quantities. However, very little of the foreign rice previously stored in warehouses has been withdrawn recently. Combined with recent continuous imports, the warehouses in Puxi are said to be full again. Therefore, Taikoo Dockyard ships with rice will need to store their cargo in Pudong warehouses in the future.

Corn shipments to the north are significant. Today, Taikoo Dockyard's Yuezhou ship is carrying 4,000 bags to Yantai.

Thick and Thin Japonica Rice and Domestic Rice: There were rumors of owners who cared about their capital, and did not wish to sell their product because of the price of rice in the production area of origin, so they held on to their stock. Spot prices remained even, the trading was limited, and there were no price changes. The sales price of Japonica rice was approximately the same as it was before. Other than the early news from the Nanhui market that japonica rice was 47.23 yuan, otherwise the price was generally the same as it previously was.

Glutinous rice arrived at prices much lower than those that came previously, a drop of approximately 50 cents from the old prices. A total of two to three thousand bags of Japonica and Glutinous rice arrived in the city.

### Flour and Wheat Trading Are Both Quiet

Flour market trading was quite quiet, due to the decline in sales to merchants in both the north and south. Shipments from Zhejiang's inland merchants were also hindered by disruptions to shipments from Shanghai, and they were purchasing and transporting directly from Changzhou and Wuxi. It is reported that flour prices in Nanjing, Yangzhou, and other places are high, so there are no hopes for them to come to Shanghai. Currently, Shunnong Shanlu and other brands produced by the Wuxi factory are also sold out, and there is no official market. The whole market is only supplied by the Huafen Factory, which distributes Lao Che and Fuxin brands, totaling over 4,000 bags, all purchased by the street and rural shops. Number 2 flour factory's price is still 13.80 yuan, and customer quotes are as high as 15 yuan, but in reality, it has quietly loosened by 0.40 to 0.50 yuan. The future of the flour market is likely to fall rather than rise. Wheat has no market. On the 29th, 8,000 bags of flour were shipped to Fujian, 40,000 bags to Tianjin, and 200 bags of bran to Hong Kong.

### Soybean Factory Sales Are Not Weak, Market Prices Remain Stable

The soybean market had little new impetus, and sentiment lacked enthusiasm. The overall situation was stable. Yesterday's market saw continued purchases from oil extraction factories, and the street claimed to have consultants, so the atmosphere was clear. Although trading was lively, prices were not easily raised. 200 bags of Anqing soybeans were traded at 23 yuan, one carload of Nanjing soybeans was traded at 11 yuan, over 700 bags of Wuhu soybeans were traded at prices ranging from 22.50 yuan to 21 yuan, six carloads of Bengbu soybeans were traded at 23.35 yuan, over 170 bags of Sang soybean were traded at 22 yuan, and over 400 bags of Chongming sand yellow soybeans were traded at prices ranging from 21.60 yuan to 21 yuan. Over 600 bags of Jiangbei green soybeans were traded at prices ranging from 18 yuan to 17.50 yuan. There were also 123 bags of soybeans shipped to Guangzhou Bay, and 10,000 pieces of bean cakes shipped to Fujian today (29th).

### Sugar Market: Telegram Reports Dutch Sugar Will Be Calculated in U.S. Dollars, Coarse White Rose by Four Yuan Yesterday

There was a telegram yesterday that stated that Dutch coarse white sugars would be set at 5.1212 of the United States' value, but this rumour has yet to be confirmed. Tianjin merchants suddenly rose and absorbed 3,000 or 4,000 packages, therefore prices quickly shot up in the Association's trading. In the morning the sales prices were 68.5-68 for goods at local warehouses, and 68.5 in the afternoon. Sugar at other warehouses was 68-68.5 and 67 in the morning, and bounced up to 67.7 and 68 in the afternoon, before again reaching 68.5, and all of this increased by four Yuan. Cargo arriving June 3 had a turnover of 55-56 Yuan, and current goods 53.5-54.5, an increase of 3.2-3.5 Yuan. B-marked cargo from the Taikoo truck was at 79-79.5, an increase of two Yuan, and old goods were at 77.5, a rise of 1.3 Yuan. H-marked cargo was about 56 Yuan, and Dutch was at 59, for an increase of 2 Yuan. The price of native white sugar was 69 Yuan, a rise of 3 Yuan. The state sugar price was not set. With the rise in imported sugar, companies were more willing to wait and see.

### Coal: Chaotic Indian Coal Market

Recently, Calcutta lump coal from India has experienced sluggish actual sales, resulting in a rather quiet market. Consequently, black market prices have repeatedly fallen, making the market extremely chaotic. Dalongxing and Dachangzhan brands are at the highest, priced at 280 yuan per ton. Yitaixing is second, at 270 yuan for self-delivery by the traders. Old orders held by market hoarders can be traded at around 262-263 yuan. The difference between traders' deals is about 20 yuan, hence the retail prices in this street are also very confusing.

### Public Concession Tax Increase Imminent - French Concession Also Increases Levies - Land Tax Increased by One Grade, Vehicle Tax Increased by 40% - House Tax Increased to 22%

According to a reporter from Ping Ming News Agency, the French Concession Board of Directors recently stated that due to high expenditures, it would be difficult to balance the budget for 1940 without a substantial increase in tax revenue. For this reason, it has been decided to increase various taxes from July 1st this year as follows: (1) Land Tax: Increased from 9/1000, 10/1000, and 11/1000 of the land value to 11/1000, 12/1000, and 13/1000; (2) House Tax: Increased from 17% of the rent to 22%; (3) Others: Taxes on public rickshaws, private chartered vehicles, rickshaws, rickshaw driver registration, private and rented carriages, bicycles, car driving licenses, car registration, motorcycles, private and rented cars, trucks, trailers, private public buses, private and rented freight cars, delivery vehicles, public passenger vehicles, test vehicles, and dog licenses will all be increased by an additional 40%.

Taxpayers Association to Express Opinions: According to a Chinese member of the French Concession Taxpayers Association, the Chinese Association has been discussing the issue of rent increases within the French Concession several times among its members. It has been decided that the Association will draft an official letter to the French Concession authorities to express its opinions. Once the acting chairman of the Association, Jin Tingsun, returns to Shanghai, the letter will be formally sent to the French Concession authorities in order to stabilize people's livelihoods and eliminate rent increase disputes.

Preliminary Plans to Restrict Illegal Rent Increases: The Public Works Department's increase of municipal taxes by 50% has been approved by the Western Taxpayers Annual Meeting. However, the Chinese Taxpayers Association, based on appeals from citizens, has repeatedly sent letters to the Public Works Department requesting a delay in implementation due to the current high prices and economic hardship. According to a reporter from Ping Ming News Agency, the Public Works Department has decided to implement the 50% increase in municipal taxes from July 1st due to budget deficits. According to a Chinese director of the Public Works Department, the increase in municipal taxes is inevitable. However, some Chinese directors are concerned that the implementation of the tax increase will lead to widespread rent increase disputes, with landlords increasing rents for sub-tenants, who in turn will pass on the increase to sub-sub-tenants. In addition, some unscrupulous individuals may take the opportunity to exploit and oppress tenants, increasing rents far beyond the proportion of the tax increase. Such illegal rent increases directly threaten the livelihoods of ordinary people and may lead to serious consequences for public safety. Therefore, the Chinese directors are preparing to propose to the Public Works Department to effectively restrict illegal rent increases and establish standards for rent increases due to tax increases, in order to reduce the threat to the livelihoods of citizens and reduce rent increase disputes. They aim to have fair and reasonable measures. However, residents hope that the measures will be formulated and announced as soon as possible, especially before the implementation of the tax increase on July 1st, so that landlords cannot use their tricks.

Overview of Rents in the Public Concession: The Public Works Department of the Public Concession will implement a 50% increase in municipal and special extra-territorial taxes on July 1st of this year. The Public Works Department's income from municipal and special taxes after the war has increased year by year, reaching its highest peak in the past decade last year. Unfortunately, due to increased wartime expenditures, the Public Works Department cannot avoid raising taxes again. The following is a summary of the Public Works Department's income from municipal and special taxes over the past decade: (1) 1930: Total 7,871,163.4 yuan, Special 455,401 yuan; (2) 1931: Total 8,219,013 yuan, Special 485,221 yuan; (3) 1932: Total 8,952,361 yuan, Special 521,136 yuan; (4) 1933: Total 9,579,571 yuan, Special 631,710 yuan; (5) 1934: Total 10,255,125 yuan, Special 741,437 yuan; (6) 1935: Total 10,284,424 yuan, Special 787,488 yuan; (7) 1936: Total 9,633,402 yuan, Special 706,274 yuan; (8) 1937: Total 8,717,064 yuan, Special 623,965 yuan; (9) 1938: Total 10,061,119 yuan, Special 894,862 yuan; (10) 1939: Total 11,982,168 yuan, Special 1,136,912 yuan. (Note: Municipal taxes are house taxes within the concession, and special municipal taxes are house taxes outside the concession.)

### News Briefs

The high tide in the Huangpu River has subsided, and the water level has receded to below eight feet. However, there will be another high tide starting on the 7th of next month, with levels all above eleven feet. Roads will be flooded.

According to the shipping industry, a ship sent a wireless message yesterday stating that five Japanese aircraft were discovered in Kanmen on the afternoon of the 24th, dropping 14 bombs on fishing boats parked along the coast, destroying several fishing boats and causing many casualties.

The Shanghai Children's Library is now in preparation and is expected to be established in mid-July.

### Tomorrow is the May 30th Anniversary - All Sectors Observe a Moment of Silence in Mourning - Concessions Implement Temporary Security for One Day

Tomorrow is the anniversary of the May 30th Incident. All sectors of the city will not hold any ceremonies, and the May 30th Cemetery will also suspend public sacrifices. However, everyone will observe a moment of silence to express their deep mourning. The police authorities of the two concessions have decided to implement temporary security for one day due to the current unstable situation. In addition to strictly prohibiting any gatherings, more police officers will patrol important roads and search suspicious pedestrians to maintain security within the concessions. The Japanese puppet regime, since the May 30th Incident originated from the killing of worker Gu Zhenghong by a Japanese yarn factory, will also implement tightened security in Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong, and will be particularly strict in searching citizens entering and leaving.

### British Aid to China - Enthusiasm Has Not Diminished - Relief Team Sent to China for Work - Under the Control of the Chinese International Red Cross

The North-China Daily News stated that a British relief team of six people has arrived in China, demonstrating that British sympathy for China's adversity has not diminished. Two members of the team, Mr. Barger and Mr. Rider, have recently arrived in Shanghai. The Shanghai Central Executive Committee of the British Fund for Relief in China had been in communication with Dr. Thompson in London, and as a result, the team was sent from Britain under the command of Dr. Deco, and under the control of the Chinese International Red Cross, to work in China, possibly in Guiyang. The other members of the team are R. Llywelyn Evans, Owen Evans, J. Jenkins, and J. Sullivan. These six individuals are willing to serve Christianity anywhere in the world. The London Committee sent six people to China and covered their living expenses. The Chinese International Red Cross may provide any shortfall. The team recently arrived in Hong Kong and was warmly received by the Governor of Hong Kong, the Chinese Women's Association, and universities. They have come from afar to serve sincerely and help alleviate suffering in the interior, which is a welcome sign. It shows that Britain is still concerned about the need to take action to relieve the suffering of many Chinese people who are suffering for no fault of their own. However, there is still much work to be done. More foreign workers, if they can be maintained by all parties, are welcome to come to China. In short, the arrival of the six members of the British relief team to assist those already engaged in this charitable work proves that although Britain has shifted its attention to events closer to home, it has not forgotten China.

### Belgian Minister Auguste de Bassompierre to Go North at the End of the Month

Belgian Minister to China, Baron Auguste de Bassompierre, will travel north at the end of this month on a Kailuan Mining Administration passenger ship to handle affairs at the Tianjin legation. After spending the summer there, Minister de Bassompierre will return south. Regarding donations from various countries, the Belgian Legation recently announced that the total amount is 109,988.5 yuan in legal tender, 126,225 Belgian francs, 3,500 French francs, 18 British pounds, and 670 US dollars. Some of the donations were made by French children, totaling 105 French francs. The above donations were calculated as of last Saturday. The Belgian Red Cross will continue to solicit donations for the purpose of慰劳傷兵 (comforting and assisting wounded soldiers).

### Negotiation Regarding Boiled Water Businesses: Exemption from Water Surcharge

The Shanghai Waterworks Company, affected by soaring prices and a surge in expenses, has been approved by the Public Concession's Public Works Department to increase the current 50% water surcharge to 110% from June 1st. The Shanghai Boiled Water Trade Association's members, concerned that the company's price increase would force their businesses to close, convened a meeting and decided to petition the company for preferential supply to alleviate their immediate crisis. The petition stated: "We, the members of the association, initially benefited from free water supply from the Waterworks Company, and later were charged at a very low rate. This was because the company, in its early stages, lacked the trust of the citizens, and our members actively promoted and encouraged its use. Gradually, the prices increased, eventually becoming higher than the water rates paid by landlords. Furthermore, the post-war coal price skyrocketed, forcing many boiled water businesses to close. However, this has led to several serious social problems: (1) If boiled water shops close or raise prices, citizens will inevitably boil their own water. Given the dense population of this isolated island, with houses like pigeon cages, the small coal stoves burning day and night are prone to causing fires. (2) Coal stoves burning day and night not only easily cause fires but also emit fumes, leading to an increase in deaths from suffocation due to coal gas. (3) The working class will inevitably drink raw water, which is detrimental to hygiene and leads to the spread of epidemics. (4) Nearly ten thousand people in the city rely on boiled water shops for their livelihood, and their livelihoods will be cut off by closures."

Therefore, to attract attention from all sectors, we petition the Assembly to appeal to the Shanghai municipal authorities in both concessions and the Waterworks Company for relief, to appropriately reduce water prices for our businesses (lower than those paid by landlords), and to exempt us from the additional surcharge in order to maintain our businesses and benefit the citizens.

### Friends of Wounded Soldiers: Enthusiastic Response from All Sectors in Shanghai, Over 200,000 Yuan Already Remitted

Since the general association of Friends of Wounded Soldiers was officially established in Chongqing, branches have been set up in various places. There has been an enthusiastic call from all walks of life to join as friends of wounded soldiers, and donations have been collected to comfort the wounded, with remarkable results. In Shanghai, although there is no branch organization of the Friends of Wounded Soldiers due to the special environment, various trade groups and enthusiastic individuals have not abandoned their responsibilities and have enthusiastically responded to the call for donations for the Friends of Wounded Soldiers and have been proceeding separately. It has been learned that, as of recently, donations exceeding 200,000 yuan have been collected and have been entrusted to the National Bank for remittance to the general association of Friends of Wounded Soldiers in Chongqing. It is hoped that all sectors will continue to contribute to boost the morale of the soldiers at the front and strive for final victory.

### Daylight Saving Time Issue: Decision Possible Today, Final Ruling by the Public Works Department Board of Directors, Foreign Banks Still Taking a Wait-and-See Attitude

Over the past two days, the authorities of both concessions have been making final decisions on the implementation of "Summer Daylight Saving Time" (advancing clocks by one hour from June 1st to October 1st). The French Concession authorities have expressed approval in principle for the proposal. The French Municipal Council passed the plan at a meeting yesterday. The Public Works Department of the Public Concession will also discuss the issue and make a final decision at its regular board meeting this afternoon.

Public Organizations Express Support: Chinese and Western public organizations in the area have expressed their support for the "Daylight Saving Time" plan. However, some parties have raised objections, pointing out that Hong Kong is not adopting the same method or advancing the time. This will cause inconvenience for brokers and banks here that need to receive Hong Kong market reports. Supporters of daylight saving time pointed out yesterday that the movement concerns the welfare of the public and cannot be sacrificed due to the opposition of a small segment of the business community. Those who feel inconvenienced can change their office hours to find a solution. Most Chinese and foreign residents here agree with the plan.

Hong Kong and Shanghai Market Issues: It is understood that the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation is one of the opponents of daylight saving time. Its reason is that the time difference between Shanghai and Hong Kong after the change will cause inconvenience for stock and exchange rate reports between the two cities. However, another perspective points out that banks in this city can retain a small number of staff for one hour after regular working hours to continue working in line with Hong Kong's "normal" time. In this way, the majority of the people can enjoy the benefits of summer daylight saving time, and both can be achieved.

Customs Reply Sent to the Public Works Department: Regarding the promotion of "Daylight Saving Time," the Public Works Department contacted the Jianghai Customs to request assistance. The Customs' reply has reportedly arrived at the Public Works Department, but department officials have declined to disclose its contents. According to foreign sources, the possibility of Customs supporting it is low. When Shanghai first implemented summer daylight saving time in 1919, the Jianghai Customs advanced the large clock on its building by one hour. However, the following year, the Jianghai Customs refused to make any changes to the clock.

U.S. Consulate General Absolutely Promotes: An official at the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai stated yesterday that the daylight saving time plan is very valuable to adopt, as it is of great benefit to the majority of residents in Shanghai. It would be ridiculous to oppose it and prevent its implementation for some minor reasons. The official added that the U.S. Consulate General employs more American staff than any other organization in the city, and the U.S. Consulate General fully supports the plan. At the same time, other important military and business organizations in Shanghai, such as the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the American Chamber of Commerce, and many large commercial firms, all support this plan.

### Shanghai Banking Industry, Following Ministry Order, Promotes Agricultural Loans, Following Savings Bank Law Regulations, at Least 20% of Deposits Must Be Loaned Out

The Ministry of Finance, recognizing that developing agriculture and increasing production are particularly urgent during this period of prolonged resistance, has promulgated the "Outline of Measures for Agricultural Loans in the 29th Year," which has been followed by the Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, and the Farmers' Bank. As for commercial banks that also operate savings businesses, according to the Savings Bank Law, agricultural investment by savings banks must not be less than 20% of savings deposits. Savings banks in Shanghai have been forced to suspend various agricultural loans because the surrounding areas have fallen into enemy hands. Therefore, the Shanghai Banking Association has been specially instructed to instruct its member banks and firms to promptly promote agricultural loans in order to comply with the provisions of the Savings Bank Law. Moreover, the foundation of prolonged resistance lies in the vast rural areas of the country. It is reported that various commercial banks in Shanghai have all followed the Ministry's order and are unanimously promoting agricultural loans. The agricultural loans handled are limited to agricultural production loans, agricultural marketing loans, agricultural product storage pledge loans, farmland water conservancy loans, agricultural tool loans, agricultural land purchase loans, rural sideline loans, and agricultural extension loans. They are all handled by the inland (non-occupied area) branches of each bank. Those without branch establishments entrust other colleagues in the interior to handle them on their behalf.

### Yangtze Hotel Bloodshed: Gu Lifeng Shot Dead, Two Shots to the Chest, Dying on the Spot, Stray Bullets Injure Three Men and Women

A shooting occurred on the eighth floor of the Yangtze Hotel on Hankou Road at approximately 9:30 AM yesterday morning. The victim was Gu Lifeng, the fourth brigade commander of the puppet "Peace and National Salvation Army." Stray bullets injured three men and women. The two assailants fired four or five shots and then went down the back elevator, escaping via Yunnan Road. The details are as follows:

Lodging in the Hotel: Gu Lifeng, also known as Jimin, was from Datuan, Nanhui. He was 29 years old, powerfully built, and resided at 12 Paris New Village, Rue Luyin, in the French Concession. He was currently the fourth brigade commander of the puppet "Peace and National Salvation Army," acting luxuriously like a newly rich man. He wore a gray lisle suit and white buckskin shoes. On the 20th of this month, Gu and his adjutant, Huang Shuangcai, and others opened room 801 on the eighth floor of the Yangtze Hotel on Hankou Road, paying 22 yuan per day. However, he registered under the alias Zhang Renmin, 29 years old, a local businessman.

Complex Elements: Gu had been renting the room for over a week. Many people came and went, a mixed group of men and women, and the elements were quite complex. Unexpectedly, at 9:30 yesterday morning, Gu got up, wearing only a undershirt and shorts, with grass slippers on his feet, and sat on the sofa with his concubine, Ms. Wu, who was wearing a green Indian silk embroidered robe. Also in the room were his adjutant, Huang Shuangcai (28 years old), Hu Aquan (from Wuxi, 27 years old), and about ten other people, chatting and laughing. Unfortunately, good times do not last, and joy turns to sorrow.

Shot Dead: Suddenly, two men in grayish-brown long gowns knocked on the door and entered. They drew their pistols and, without asking questions, opened fire on Gu with four or five shots. Gu was caught off guard and shot twice in the chest. He immediately fell to the ground and died on the spot. The stray bullets injured his concubine's left foot, Hu Aquan's chest, and Huang Shuangcai's left arm. The gunmen, seeing that their goal had been achieved, rushed out of the door, crossed the corridor opposite, and took the elevator down to the north, escaping through the back door of the hotel. Afterwards, the early-shift waiter reported to the accounting office, who reported to the Old Gate Police Station. Chinese and Western detectives quickly arrived in police cars, but the assailants had already disappeared.

Police Investigation: An ambulance was immediately called to take the three injured men and women to Renji Hospital for treatment. His concubine, Ms. Wu, was slightly injured and released from the hospital after being bandaged. The other two were hospitalized for treatment. The body was transported to the morgue in a hearse. This morning, the Shanghai District Court sent personnel to investigate. Gu's wife, Ms. Sheng (29 years old), was notified to come forward and was taken to the police station for questioning. The police are currently investigating the reason for Gu's sudden assassination.

Brief History of the Deceased: Afterwards, the reporter rushed to investigate and saw blood stains in room 801. The tables and chairs were in disarray. One Chinese and one Western detective were still inspecting the room. Gu's belongings, such as a pair of yellow and white leather shoes, suits, shirts, and many floral ornaments, were wrapped in sheets and taken back to the police station for storage. Huang Furong (from Jiangbei), the shop assistant No. 15, was called in to describe the appearance and clothing of the assailants and the route of their escape in detail, so that they could be tracked down, arrested, and dealt with. According to those familiar with Gu's family background, Gu was from Datuan, Nanhui, Pudong. His family was well-off. He was good at socializing and often liked to hunt with a gun. After the Chinese army retreated to the west, Gu organized a guerrilla force in the Pudong-Nanhui area under the command of Miao Xishan. After Ding defected, Gu's determination wavered, and he followed suit, becoming the fourth brigade commander of the "Peace and National Salvation Army." The so-called "adjutant" Huang Shuangcai and Hu Aquan, who were injured, were Gu's apprentices who extorted money from civilians in the Pudong area.

### Customs Restricts Currency Carried by Visitors on Ships to 200 Yuan: New Regulation by the Wenzhou Customs

The Wenzhou Customs has recently found that passengers leaving Wenzhou on foreign ships often carry excess legal tender. When customs officers inspect, they claim to be seeing off guests, thus avoiding suspicion of carrying currency for export. In reality, the currency is transferred to passengers or stewards for smuggling out of the country. In order to eliminate this abuse, it has been announced that those seeing off guests on ships are also limited to carrying 200 yuan in legal tender. Those exceeding the limit will be confiscated in accordance with regulations, and customs officers have been ordered to conduct strict inspections. The Czech community in Shanghai celebrated the 56th birthday of former Czech President Dr. Edvard Beneš at 9:30 last night. Major Štefan reported on Beneš's past achievements at the meeting. Beneš was a founding father of Czechoslovakia and made great contributions to the Czech national liberation movement. Under his leadership, Czechoslovakia was hailed as a model democratic country in Europe, granting equal rights and political representation to ethnic minorities in the country. The general public enjoyed freedom of speech and publication, and even the German ethnic minority enjoyed equal freedom. Currently, although the 13 million Czech people are suffering under the Nazi German occupation, they firmly believe that after the European war, their country's freedom will be fully restored. They know that the Czech provisional government in London and the Czechs abroad are fighting alongside the major democratic countries against Nazi German aggression. Thousands of Czechs abroad are fighting in France and preparing to make great sacrifices. Therefore, the Czech community in Shanghai celebrates the birthday of the former president in a timely manner to show its solidarity and its deep belief that the country will gain independence and freedom in the current European war. Dr. Beneš is currently lecturing at the University of Chicago in the United States.

### U.S. Warship Marblehead Arrives in Shanghai to Increase Defense, U.S. Submarine Squadron to Arrive in Shanghai in Mid-July

The flagship of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, the USS Augusta, left Shanghai at 2:30 PM on the 27th for a northern patrol, first docking in Yantai and Qingdao, and then sailing to Qinhuangdao for patrol. The minesweeper USS Finch, Commander Hough's USS Isabel, and the transport ship USS Gold Star also left Shanghai and sailed north. According to reports, the USS Marblehead will arrive in Shanghai from Manila in the next day or two. It is also said that a U.S. submarine squadron will arrive in Shanghai in mid-July, but this has not been confirmed. Currently, the only U.S. warships berthed in Shanghai are the Yangtze River gunboats USS Luzon and USS Guam.

### European Mail to Be Delivered via Different Routes

Since the outbreak of the European war, the Hong Kong authorities have been inspecting mail between Shanghai and Hong Kong. Recently, as the war situation has become more tense, the inspection work has become more rigorous. According to a Reuters reporter, the scope of inspection has now expanded, with almost no exception for letters, books, printed matter, and packages. Mail from the mainland transiting through Hong Kong to Shanghai is also subject to inspection from time to time. All inspected mail is carefully resealed by the mail inspectors, with a label in English stating "Inspected by the Hong Kong Government" and a painted emblem. It is also learned that the inspection staff is well-trained, so the work is very thorough. All inspected mail is not damaged or lost.

Current Mail Routes to and from Europe: Mail to and from Europe still follows three routes: Suez, the Pacific, and Siberia. However, nationals of neutral countries mostly specify Pacific transport for mail sent from Shanghai to Europe, which is transported to the United States via the Pacific and then to Europe. Mail to England and France still goes through the Suez Canal. The Siberian route is avoided because it must pass through Germany, in order to avoid inspection and detention. The situation for German mail is the opposite. Maritime transport has been abandoned, and it is now transported via Siberia.

Netherlands, Belgium, and Norway: Previously, mail from Shanghai to the Netherlands and Belgium was directly packed and dispatched. However, since the German invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium, mail from Shanghai to the Netherlands and Belgium has been rerouted through England and France from the 14th of this month. Mail to Norway is also rerouted through Sweden, as the current situation in these three countries is very unclear.

### Dutch East Indies Dividends to Be Remitted as Usual

The Dutch Consulate General in Shanghai received a message from the Dutch East Indies authorities yesterday, stating that the dividends of various plantation companies there will be remitted as usual soon.

### Celebration of the 30th Anniversary of the Union of South Africa: Commercial Representative to Host Grand Banquet, Hosting Overseas Chinese and British Officials

This Friday marks the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Union of South Africa. The South African community in Shanghai will hold a celebration on that day. Mr. Ge Yin, the honorary commercial representative of the Union of South Africa in Shanghai, and his wife will host a banquet at the Country Club from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM to entertain the South African community in Shanghai, as well as officials from the British Embassy, the British Consulate, British military officers, leaders and representatives of British societies, and prominent British expatriates, totaling three or four hundred guests. However, the banquet is informal, so there will be no speeches. The Union of South Africa was formed on May 31, 1910, from the merger of the British South African colonies and the Dutch Boer Republics.

### Counterfeit Currency Case on Rue Yalupe: Jurisdictional Issue Arises, Case Uncovered by the Public Concession Police, Many Counterfeiters Arrested

Zhou Honglin, the chief detective of the Chinese Detective Department of the Public Concession Police, learned that a large-scale counterfeit currency organization was secretly set up at No. 594 Rue Yalupe in the French Concession. He immediately worked with Chinese Detective Song Bingzheng and Detective Lang Yunchun to arrest Zhao Shida from Jiangsu, Li Minghai from Danyang, and Zhang Rongda from Changzhou. Besides confiscating 4,000 counterfeit five-yuan banknotes of the Bank of China and 400 counterfeit fractional currency notes of the Central Bank, they also obtained two large machines used for printing counterfeit currency, nineteen photographic copper plates of counterfeit currency, three printing stones, and five master plates. The cracking of the counterfeit currency organization is the largest in recent years. The case was sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This case was investigated by Judge Xie Yeye in the Criminal Court One yesterday morning. According to police lawyer Ru Bao Yi, there are several important accomplices in the case who are still at large, Zhang Liankui (also known as Jin Sheng), Li Guoying, Bao Daoliang, Luo, Jin (also known as Chen Hong), etc. The police are currently rigorously investigating them. He requested permission to postpone the interrogation on the grounds that the case needed to be further investigated. After Judge Xiao verified, he ordered the case to be adjourned for further interrogation, and the defendants were returned to custody.

The case itself now has a jurisdictional issue. Since the manufacturing organization is in the French Concession, the jurisdiction of the criminal case, based on the location where the crime occurred, should be under the jurisdiction of the Second Special District Local Court. However, the discovery of this case was based on clues from the confession of criminals in another case obtained by the Public Concession Putuo Road Police. If the relationship of accomplices is considered, it should be under the jurisdiction of the First Special District Court of the original trial. Therefore, which court has jurisdiction is still under consideration by the Standing Committee.

### Embezzled Over 10,000 Yuan, All Sent to Gambling Dens, Xie Yiji Detained Pending Investigation

Xu Fuliang, a native of Ningbo, 32 years old, owner of the Zhenchangxiang Hardware Store at No. 80 Rue Guichuan in the French Concession, entrusted Xie Yiji, a native of Shaoxing, 25 years old, residing at No. 123 Sanhe Lane, Tiantong Road, to operate construction hardware materials outside the store. Xu provided the capital, and the profits were to be divided equally between the two. Unexpectedly, Xie took advantage of the pretext of receiving goods, and successively obtained 10,120 yuan in cash from Xu from the end of April. He secretly went to a gambling den in western Shanghai and lost everything. He then disappeared. Xu discovered this recently and reported it to the French Police. Xie was arrested by Detective Kang Hui the day before yesterday and brought to the court. Yesterday afternoon, Xie was sent to Court One of the Second Special District Court, where he was interrogated by Judge Miao Qingbang. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahong stated that the defendant was being charged with embezzlement in business and requested a postponement for investigation before requesting a trial. The plaintiff, Xu Fuliang, then stated the details of the defendant's successive receipt of funds. When asked, Xie confessed that the numbers were correct and that he had indeed lost everything and had no ability to repay. The court verified the confession and ordered the case to be adjourned for further interrogation. The defendant was detained.

### Zhongshan Road, Japanese Soldiers Overturn Vehicle, Two Japanese Soldiers Seriously Injured

At approximately 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, two Japanese soldiers riding a motorized bicycle turned from Xietu Road onto Zhongshan Road. While turning, they were going too fast, causing the vehicle to overturn on the side of the road. Both Japanese soldiers were thrown from the vehicle, with their heads bleeding and seriously injured. The Japanese military police patrolling nearby noticed this and rushed them to the Fenglinqiao Military Hospital for treatment.

### Habitual Robbers Each Sentenced to Twelve Years Imprisonment

The notorious robbers Qi Asheng, Jin Honggen, and Chen Zhenglin, all from Jiangsu, on the morning of April 19 at 11:15 AM, along with two others at large, Wang Afu and a man surnamed Zhu, robbed the home of Chen Xiaoming, a doctor from Danyang, at No. 54, Lane 177, Qipu Road, of valuables worth over 140 yuan. They rushed out and hired a car in front of the First Special District Court on North Zhejiang Road, intending to go to western Shanghai. Chen Xiaoming's servant, Wang Xihe, secretly followed them. He immediately reported to patrolmen No. 565, No. 1443, and No. 1667 of the Third Division of Chinese Police passing by, who surrounded the car. Qi and others, in desperation, got out of the car. Qi was arrested, drew his gun and resisted, resulting in his death when a bullet hit a vital area. Jin was shot twice in the leg and fell to the ground. Chen was captured on the spot, along with two pistols and seven bullets, and taken to the Huisi Police Station, before being sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This has already been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the trial in Criminal Court Three. Police lawyer Qian Xun explained the details of the case, stating that, after further investigation, it was found that the pistol held by the defendant Jin Hong was purchased from the robber Wu Caifu, who has been arrested in the French Concession. He also committed robbery in the French Concession. And that the defendant Chen Zhenglin was also a habitual offender, requesting severe punishment. Judge Jiang verified the facts and sentenced Jin Honggen and Chen Zhenglin to twelve years imprisonment each. The guns and bullets were confiscated.

### Yesterday Morning on Avenue Joffre: Money Flying Everywhere, A Westerner Threw It from the Rooftop, Passersby Scrambled to Pick It Up, About 1,000 Yuan in Ten-Yuan Legal Tender

Yesterday morning, a strange incident of banknotes falling from the sky occurred on Avenue Joffre. At about 7:50 AM, on the roof of the Bain Apartments, facing Avenue Joffre between Rue Luyin and Rue Hua Long, a Westerner of unknown name suddenly threw ten-yuan banknotes onto the ground. Passersby who noticed this immediately rushed forward to pick them up, regardless of the reason. At that time, the Westerner continued to throw the banknotes down in a state that seemed drunk and perhaps crazy. The amount thrown down was about 1,000 yuan in legal tender. Not only were there colorful paper fluttering in the air like falling sycamore leaves, but the ground was also in a chaotic mess, filled with the sounds of "Picking up money!" French police detectives, seeing the crowd gathered there, assumed that an accident had occurred and rushed to investigate. After learning the details, they went up to the roof of the Bain Apartments to investigate, but the "rich and generous" Westerner had already disappeared. After inquiries, there were still no leads to be found. Therefore, no one can know the motive behind this person's throwing of banknotes, except for himself. According to witnesses at the time, the banknotes thrown down were all red ten-yuan banknotes of the Bank of Communications. However, according to French police news, the total amount thrown down by the Westerner was about 1,000 yuan.

### Equity in Lao Zheng He Dye Works: Appeal Allowed for Mrs. Lu and Her Son for New Investigation of Criminal Records

Xu Huijun, a native of Shaoxing, owner of the Huifeng Silk Shop at No. 5, Lane 31, Beishan West Road, invested 200 yuan in 1916 to join the Lao Zheng He Dye Works on Avenue Edward VII under the name of Lu Tingjian as a silent partner. In years with a surplus, up to 1931, the tacit capital stock had increased to 2,000 yuan, until recently the bonus dividend calculation has been around 100,000, and Lu had always been honest, and made payments over the years. Unexpectedly, Lu died in the Mid-Autumn Festival of the year before last. Lu's wife, Sun, and Lu's son, Yongnian, denied that Xu had any equity. Xu then hired lawyers Yu Zhong, Luo Chen Kun Rong, etc. to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special District against Lu's wife, Sun, and his son, Yongnian, to confirm the tacit equity as a partner and to settle the dividend bonuses. After Judge Ma Yishu heard the case, he ruled to confirm the plaintiff's 2/10 of the silent equity in the "Lao Zheng He Mao Ji (formerly Yifa Ji)" shares of the defendants. However, the share certificate submitted by Mrs. Lu and her son in the civil case was forged, and a public prosecution was filed with the French Police. The Criminal Court of the High Branch Court sentenced Mrs. Lu and her son and Lu's in-law, Jiang Shangxian, to two years in prison each. Now Mrs. Lu and her son are dissatisfied with the civil court's judgment and have appealed to the Civil Court of the High Branch Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Tong presided over the investigation in the Third Court. Both sides were represented by lawyers. After questioning both sides in court, it was decided that a new hearing would be scheduled because it was necessary to investigate the civil and criminal records.

### Rental Boat Dispute: Further Hearing Still Orders Compensation

Local resident Han Funan owned a small steamboat before the war. In the third month of the year before last, he rented it to Qu Songqing, the owner of the Qu Changshun fish shop on Xiaodongmen Street, for the purpose of transporting fresh fish. At that time, they agreed on a lease term of three months. After the lease expired, Liu Wuzhai, a native of Wuxi, was brought in to continue the lease, with Qu acting as guarantor. Unexpectedly, after renewing the lease, Qu and others, without obtaining the boat owner's consent, unilaterally added the boat to the "Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company," a Japanese company, and renamed it "Yixing Maru." Upon discovering this, the boat owner, Han Funan, commissioned lawyer Wu Pengxian to file a lawsuit with the Second Court's Civil Division, seeking the return of the boat and compensation for damages. After three trials, the court ruled that the defendant, Qu Songqing, should compensate the boat owner, Han Funan, eight thousand yuan for the value of the boat. The portion of the claim related to damages was remanded for further hearing. It is now learned that this case has been concluded by Judge Xia of the Third Branch of the High Court, who announced the judgment yesterday, ordering the defendant to compensate the boat owner, Sheng Funan, thirty yuan for losses.

### Bad Elements in Western Shanghai: Thugs Fail in Attempt to Seize Car

At 11:30 AM yesterday, another incident occurred in the lawless area of western Shanghai in which thugs attempted to seize a car but failed. According to the reporter's investigation, a thug went to the Xiang Sheng automobile shop opposite Zhaofeng Garden on Yuyuan Road to hire a car. The chauffeur drove car number 18577 in response. After the thug got into the car, he ordered the chauffeur to drive towards Dunxin Road. Upon arriving at Dunxin Road, the thug ordered the chauffeur to stop, forcibly dragged him out of the car, and attempted to drive it himself. However, because the thug was unable to start the engine and feared being discovered, he hastily abandoned the car and fled. The chauffeur then drove the car back to the company and reported the incident to the police.

### Residents of Sandeli, Edward Road Demand Rent Increase

Fang Er, the landlord of the houses in Sandeli, Edward Road in the Public Concession, suddenly notified all tenants on the 24th of this month that rents would be increased starting June 1st. The tenants, considering the difficult living conditions during these extraordinary times, protested that the landlord's new rent increase was as high as 30% to 40%. They unanimously opposed this unilateral notification. Therefore, the tenants of Sandeli jointly sent a letter to the landlord last night, arguing that the tenants bear all the costs of water and electricity for the houses, and that additional taxes are scheduled to begin in July. They unanimously opposed the rent increase and decided to pay the rent at the original rate, refusing to pay any new increase.

### Teenager Run Over and Killed by Car

Wang Jincai, fifteen years old, was walking near Guangxi Road on Sixth Avenue at 5:55 PM yesterday when he was suddenly struck by a car and run over. He suffered severe head injuries and lost consciousness. He was taken to Renji Hospital by the Chinese police, but died before arriving. The driver responsible for the accident has been detained by the police pending further investigation.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Inspection: Seeking Suggestions for Improvement

The various shipping companies operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line have received a notice from the Ningbo Shipping Administration Office, stating that since its establishment, all Ningbo River shipping affairs have been under its jurisdiction. As the Ningbo Inspection Office had not yet been established at the time, the inspection of ships, goods, and passengers was temporarily handled by the martial law ship inspection team, the First District Investigation Office, and various agencies and units, respectively. Over the past few months, the office has been grateful for the concern of all sectors and their suggestions for improving shipping. Therefore, all matters beneficial to shipping or convenient for merchants, whether submitted in writing or offered orally, have been considered and implemented. These include adding outer port anchorages, separating loading and unloading of passenger and cargo ships, appropriately reducing passenger ticket prices, direct shipping by tugboats, cargo transport by sailing ships, and direct approval of import and export goods. These are all gradual improvements. Among these, the inspection of ships, passengers, and goods falls outside the scope of the office's authority. Although there are good suggestions, there has been no time to consider them. Recently, the Inspection Office has been established. In the future, if there are any suggestions for improving the inspection of goods and passengers, please submit them directly to the Inspection Office for consideration. It is hoped that this information will be conveyed to all sectors so that all government measures can meet the needs of the general public and become more convenient.

### French Concession Board of Directors: Crackdown on Unhygienic Milk

The Health Committee of the French Concession Board of Directors has formulated the following measures to crack down on unhygienic milk: (1) Starting January 1, 1941, milk from Pudong will not be allowed to be sold in the concession. (2) Milk sheds in the concession and Xujiahui area must, before December 31, 1940, be ordered to implement all improvements specified by the Sanitation Department, especially the use of tap water for drinking, the installation of gutters in the sheds, and the employment of specially qualified workers. Otherwise, their licenses will be revoked.

### French Concession June: Night Duty for Pharmacies

The French Concession Authority attaches great importance to public health. Public health is closely related to public health, and its impact is significant. Therefore, in addition to implementing various health policies on a quarterly basis, such as vaccinations, the Authority also designates pharmacies to be on night duty each month to facilitate the public's purchase of essential medicines at night. These measures deserve praise and should not be overlooked. It is now learned that the order of night duty for pharmacies in the French Concession for June has been announced by the French Concession Board of Directors yesterday, as follows: 1st, 10th, 19th, 28th: Universal Pharmacy, 949 Avenue Dubail; 2nd, 11th, 20th, 29th: Empire Pharmacy, 161 Rue de Saisons; 3rd, 12th, 21st, 30th: Asia Pharmacy, 1918 Avenue Joffre; 4th, 13th, 22nd: Buick Pharmacy, 664 Avenue du Roi Albert; 5th, 14th, 23rd: Standard Pharmacy, 718 Avenue du Roi Albert; 6th, 15th, 24th: Russian Public Pharmacy, 23 Rue Henri; 7th, 16th, 25th: Puli Pharmacy, 88 Route Doumer; 8th, 17th, 26th: Xinyi Pharmacy, 812 Avenue du Roi Albert; 9th, 18th, 27th: Puli Pharmacy, Rue Lupan.

### Tax Police Request Allowances: Satisfactory Response Received

The Jianghai Customs' tax police and coolies had previously jointly submitted a petition and delegated representatives to visit the Customs Commissioner twice, citing the high cost of living and requesting that, in addition to rice subsidies, they be granted an additional allowance equivalent to 150% of their actual monthly salary, starting in March. It is now learned that the authorities, after considering the matter, have responded favorably, adopting the same approach as with postal allowances. In addition to rice subsidies, postal workers also receive a small class-based allowance of 15 yuan per month.

### Letter

To the Editor:

According to Mr. Hu Ansheng, the news article "Restaurant Owner Abandons Old Concubine for New Love, Concubine Requests Living Expenses," published in the Shen Bao on the 27th of this month, is completely inconsistent with the facts. Yuan Jinwen rented a room at the Hengyi Inn in January of the 21st year of the Republic. Hu Ansheng met her because he often visited the innkeeper, Cheng Shaonan. However, there was no cohabitation or other relationship. Therefore, Yuan Jinwen's claims of cohabitation, support, and education expenses are completely fabricated and have ulterior motives. Anyone with clear eyes can see this. Furthermore, the claim that Hu Ansheng filed a lawsuit against her in a court in western Shanghai is also a false accusation and is extremely absurd. I have been commissioned to write this letter requesting the Shen Bao to promptly correct the record and avoid misleading the public. I hereby submit the facts and hope that your newspaper will make a prompt correction.

Sincerely,

Lawyers Zhang Shanle and Xu Xingti

May 27th

### Immortal Teacher of Shanghang

Shanghang County in Fujian Province has a temple dedicated to the Immortal Teacher. During the Xianfeng reign, the Taiping rebels disturbed the county seat. They relied on the divine spirit's assistance to turn danger into safety, and also prayed for rain to ward off epidemics, and showed miraculous responses repeatedly. This temple is dedicated to Huang Shi, styled Qi Weng, of the Southern Song Dynasty, and his son-in-law. Qi Weng was a native of Jiangxia, who migrated to Shanghang. He was born with unusual features, and the word "Teacher" appeared on his hand, so he was named Teacher. The gazetteer records that there were monstrous tigers and wolves causing harm in the county. Qi Weng and his son and son-in-law all had extraordinary skills. They went to subdue them, and the monsters disappeared. They hid in a stone wall, revealing three divine images. During wind and rain, the sound of drums is often heard. The people built a temple under the Incense Burner Stone of the Jiuqu Creek, called the Huang Xing Immortal Teacher Temple. During the Shunzhi and Kangxi reigns, the Yue bandits Xie Zhiliang and others caused trouble, coupled with the rebellion of Geng Jingzhong, the people were in turmoil. The Immortal Teacher manifested his spirit and was unharmed. In the 22nd year of Daoguang, floods surrounded the city, and a severe epidemic broke out. People went to the temple to pray, and the water receded in less than a day, and the epidemic stopped after ten days. In the seventh year of Xianfeng, the rebels occupied Tingzhou. The government army suffered defeat in battle. Local bandits colluded with the Tingzhou rebels, attacking with landmines and cannons. The county seat was about to fall, but fortunately, divine assistance was obtained, driving them away twice, and the local area was turned from danger to safety. According to gentry Qi Yaoxi and others, they compiled a clear list of facts and submitted it to the relevant county magistrate for sealing, and then the county magistrate reported to the provincial treasurer, who reported to the Governor-General of Min-Zhe He Jing and the Fujian Provincial Governor Li Mingchi. He and Li have already knelt and奏皇上, appealing for additional sealing.

Spring and Autumn

### Zhang Yisheng Seeking Employment

— Editor

Yesterday, we received a letter from Zhang Yisheng, a student at Yangzhou Middle School. It stated: "I am from a poor family and cannot afford the tuition for the next semester. Therefore, I would like to tutor the children of wealthy families in my spare time to complete my final year of high school..." His contact address is Yangzhou Middle School, Xinshichang.

Our newspaper does not have a "Social Services" section, which I assume Mr. Zhang is aware of. Furthermore, this publication has never had a precedent for "self-introductions." However, Mr. Zhang's letter concludes with: "I hope that you, sir, will give your full assistance and publish this in a corner of Spring and Autumn. I would be most grateful..."

Therefore, I suspect that he has already advertised in newspapers with social service columns, perhaps more than once, but without any response. As a student from a poor family, he naturally cannot afford a classified advertisement for "seeking employment." Therefore, he sent it to this publication, hoping to receive even a small chance of success.

After careful consideration, I have decided to make an exception for this young man who is determined to pursue his education and publish his letter as above. However, whether he will be able to find employment as a result is unpredictable.

In Shanghai, I believe there are many young people who are deprived of their right to education due to poverty. However, it is especially difficult for a middle school student to find a job in their spare time to help with tuition fees. Therefore, after "publishing" the letter, I have a small "request" - a request to all schools.

A student like this is definitely not comparable to those young masters who frequent dance halls under the guise of "seeking education." He will definitely seize this rare opportunity and work hard at his studies. Although the saying "poor students are always good students" is not logical, it is indeed the case in reality. Therefore, my request is: schools should, within their capabilities, waive the next semester's tuition fees for students with excellent grades, and continue to waive them if they continue to perform well. This would both encourage students with excellent grades and allow hardworking students from poor families to have the opportunity to pursue their education.

### Relief for Refugee Children's Spiritual Hunger

— Yu Bi

In the past few days, students from the Cilian Middle School have come to our company to solicit book donations. Although their words were very earnest, as if devout believers were praying to God, full of hope, it is the company authorities who make the decisions. We are of little importance and unable to help, so they ultimately left disappointed. However, I personally sympathize with them very much. Therefore, on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 24th), I not only sent them the books I had read, but also made a visit.

Their school is located at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Alabaster Road. I visited the leader of the seventh donation team, Mr. Bao Junzhang, who then introduced me to teachers Fan and Yang of the school. According to them, the school is run by the Cilian Association and currently has more than 170 students, all of whom were sent by the Mountain Dundin Road Refugee Shelter and the Cilian General Association. They are a vocational middle school, and their curriculum is slightly biased towards commerce, generally similar to ordinary middle schools, but there are no science subjects, which are replaced by bookkeeping, economics, salesmanship, and other subjects. They are all orphaned refugee children. Some of their parents have been sent back to their hometowns, and some are orphans with no relatives. The school not only provides them with food and lodging, but also books and stationery. It is naturally very difficult for them to buy some books to read outside of class. However, the school's finances are very tight, and it is already difficult to maintain their lives and studies. Where would they have the resources to set up a complete library? However, these children have a particularly strong desire for knowledge. They are already tired of the few old books and magazines in the original library. They need new books to absorb new nourishment. Therefore, they volunteered to organize seven donation teams to solicit books from the outside world and their relatives and friends in order to expand their library. The deadline is one week. It is easy to find the few relationships they have. They also hope that people from all walks of life will give them enthusiastic assistance so that they can have unexpected gains.

They also told me that what they need most now are books on natural sciences, because the school does not have any courses in that area. These children lack knowledge in that area and feel an urgent need for it. Secondly, books on literature and social sciences are also welcome.

Finally, Mr. Yang also said that anyone who has books they have read, no matter how new or old, and is willing to donate them, they would be very grateful. They also hope that everyone who sympathizes with them will encourage their relatives and friends to donate the books they have read to them so that their library can be enriched. In short, the more the better.

### Exam Papers

— Ye Ying

Exams are a method used by school authorities to assess student performance. In the past, exam papers were distributed by the school authorities, but since schools have become commercialized, exam papers also have to be purchased by the students themselves. However, the school stipulates that exam papers must be purchased from the school authorities. Previously, they were two cents per paper; last year, they were raised once to four cents. But unexpectedly, they have been increased by another two cents recently, and now each paper costs six cents. There are four exams per semester, with eight or nine papers per exam. Each exam costs each student five jiao. With 1,500 students in the whole school, the income from exam papers has increased from two cents to six cents, an unexpected income of 1,500 yuan, which is a considerable sum!

This is just one example of the methods used by the school authorities to exploit the students. There are many others.

"Harsh taxes are fiercer than tigers." After reading this, I cannot help but feel chills.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 24 - Lakes and Mountains Cleaned, Each with Their Own Merits; Men and Women Rejoicing Together, Calling "Long Live!"

Today, a meeting was held in the village council chamber, and there were many guests. The one-armed Elder Zhu was elected chairman. First, the students of Ziyou Village Elementary School sang the national anthem, and then Elder Zhu took the stage to give a speech. Elder Zhu, with his white beard and his empty, fluttering sleeve, commanded respect as he walked onto the stage. Elder Zhu began: "We must not forget the martyrs who sacrificed themselves to save us on that day. We must commemorate our martyrs. Please everyone rise and observe three minutes of silence." At this moment, everyone stood up in unison and observed silence, even the foreigners. Among them were also descendants of several martyrs, such as Miss Jin Danyun and Miss Shao Huiyun, who could not help but shed tears during the silence. After the three minutes were up, Elder Zhu gave a speech, briefly recounting the situation during the Anti-Japanese War. He also recalled several old friends who had sacrificed themselves for their loyalty and bravery in resisting the enemy, such as so-and-so and so-and-so. Although he himself had lost an arm, he had survived until now. At that point, Elder Zhu could not help but burst into tears. Afterwards, he also talked about village governance. He said: "Ziyou Village has been established for five years, and the five-year plan has only achieved this much. Other villages are much more developed than us. However, we must be grounded in reality and proceed step by step. We do not seek prosperity, but wish for all villagers to be hardworking and strive for progress." After Elder Zhu's speech, Dr. Zhang also gave a speech, because Dr. Zhang knew everything about Elder Zhu in detail. When he spoke of entrusting the orphan and joining the army, Zhu's lover was also wiping away tears. After this meeting, there was the opening ceremony of the Ziyou Village Library, and everyone went to the library. Although the library was not very large, it was the most modern type. After Mrs. Surya performed the opening ceremony, they hurried to participate in the groundbreaking ceremony of the silk weaving factory. Elder Zhu, who was respected for his age and virtue, performed the groundbreaking ceremony. After the groundbreaking ceremony, it was already half past twelve, and everyone went to the village council chamber for lunch. There were quite a few guests, men and women, about 130 or 140 people. Miss He and others had her father's friend, Mr. Jiang Jingrong, sit in the chairman's seat, with two old ladies on either side, Mrs. Surya on the left and Dr. Zhang on the right. Jiang Jingrong, who had started as a newsboy, said: "The thing I feared most when selling newspapers was rainy weather. Like the past few days, the rain was very dull, but today, on the day of the Great National Day, the weather has cleared up. This symbolizes the post-war revival of our Republic of China, clearing and opening up after the storm and the haze. Look at the clear sky after the rain, with all the clouds swept away. Let us all drink to that!" He raised his glass, drained it in one gulp, and shouted "Long live the Republic of China!" Everyone also drained their glasses! Shouting Long live the Republic of China! It is true: "You drink a cup of wine, celebrating hundreds of millions of years of the Republic of China!" (The End)

### Advance Notice of the Guo Feng Opera Troupe's Performance: Introducing Several Famous Teachers

— Sick Dove

The Guo Feng Opera Troupe, organized by Shanghai's opera teachers, has announced its establishment after several meetings. Following this is a charity performance to raise funds, scheduled for two performances during the day on June 1st and 8th. The program for the 1st includes "Heavenly Thunder Retribution," "Rouge Tiger," "The Stolen Imperial Scroll," and "Changban Slope." The program for the 8th includes "Celebrating Dingzhu," "Night Flight," "Zhatou Pass," "Meeting of Heroes," and "Ning Wu Pass." All the opera teachers in Shanghai will cooperate in the performance, which should be quite organized. It is indeed gratifying that the ranks of Peking Opera teachers in Shanghai, which have always been very scattered, have been able to come together to form this group. Of course, our hope is not only to see the brilliance of their performance this time, but also to expect them to do more research with each other, develop the old, create the new, and support the declining Peking Opera. Some people say that this performance can observe the level of Peking Opera in Shanghai, which may be partly true, but our appreciation should not treat them as famous actors. To be honest, most of the teachers are either out of voice or old, so if you want to hear crisp and loud voices, I guarantee you will return disappointed. So, what should we look for? That is the beautiful figure and the mellow voice. Pay attention to the places people don't pay attention to, and observe the depths of the movements with sharp eyes. You will definitely be able to gain a lot. There are several noteworthy figures among them, whom I will now introduce.

Rui Debao is the most prestigious teacher in Shanghai. He studied martial arts with Li Lianzhong at a young age, and later studied with Huang Yueshan in middle age. He is one of the few surviving practitioners of the Huang school of martial arts. He later performed on the same stage with Lao Tan for more than ten years, and learned all its subtleties. Rui Ling participated in all of Tan's famous plays in his middle age. Unfortunately, his voice was very strange and could not withstand heavy singing, so he never gained fame in his life. In recent years, he has been teaching students in Shanghai, and is very skilled in the Tan school and armed dramas. It is surprising that none of his disciples have become outstanding talents, perhaps due to the highbrow nature of the art.

Liu Juchan is a veteran storyteller. He has a large number of students in Hankou and Shanghai. He founded the Juju Society and cultivated many talents. Professionals such as Chen Meiyin, Song Yuru, Zhao Xiaolan, and Peng Ling have all been influenced by him. He is a distinguished student of Jia Honglin and can tell Tan school operas and Mei school Qingyi. He knows many operas and has a wide repertoire.

Bao Fu is the teacher of famous amateurs Sun Junqing and Zhao Peixin. Professionals Xu Hongpei, Li Huiliang, and Chen Peiqing have also studied with him. He has a long history in Shanghai and can tell Tan school operas with stability.

Guan Hongbin started as a clown, playing all roles: Sheng, Dan, Jing, and Chou. He has been a teacher for dozens of amateur opera clubs in Shanghai and is a popular figure in the amateur world. Not long ago, he led a troupe to the United States and is currently the head of academic affairs at the Opera School.

### The Theatrical Tide of the Provisional Capital (Part 2)

— Bi Ying

Transformation of a Satirical Drama

Everyone knows Cao Yu. He is the author of the trilogy "Thunderstorm," "Sunrise," and "The Wilderness." His writing skills need no recommendation from us. Since the War of Resistance, he has been silent for a long time, and people have missed him so much! Everyone hoped that he would use his sharp pen to portray the light and darkness of this great era. Recently, Cao Yu finally completed his first masterpiece during the War of Resistance, making a name for himself in the provisional capital.

"Transformation," yes, this is the title of Cao Yu's new play. As the name suggests, its content is probably very clear: changing from old to new is its central theme. He uses a provincial wounded soldier hospital in the great era as a backdrop, exposing the bureaucratic habits of the old elements, their perfunctory and exploitative behavior, their careless attitude, their selfishness in hindering others' progress, and their dissolute profiteering from the national crisis, turning the hospital into a mess. As a character in the play scolds, "This is supposed to be an organization? Does this kind of organization even deserve to talk about the War of Resistance!" At the same time, Mr. Cao then turns his pen to the bright side. He uses a new official, with his capable and resolute spirit, to overcome the hospital's corruption. Some of the former scoundrels are all expelled and left behind by the times. Then, he also writes about the downfall of the scoundrels. "Transformation" concludes with the transition from darkness to light.

The playwright's pen is venomous and sharp, but especially because of its mercilessness, the play is realistic, more profound, and more vivid.

The theatrical tide in Chongqing in April was not lonely. After this, there were originally other famous plays such as "Prelude to Victory" and "Spring in Jiangnan" scheduled to be performed. However, because all the preparatory work—such as rehearsals—was insufficient, they could not continue and were interrupted. However, it cannot be denied that the performance of these famous plays has planted new seeds among the audience in the provisional capital, giving everyone a new understanding of spoken drama.

### Talking About Opera with Cheng Yanqiu

— Su Shaoqing

Mr. Cheng Yanqiu has already left Shanghai by boat. The day before, Mr. Jin hosted a farewell dinner for him at Mr. You's residence. In addition to opera fans, there were several martial arts masters among the guests. The host, Mr. You, is deeply involved in the study of boxing and is extremely diligent, and he is also a vegetarian. His weight has decreased from over 180 pounds to 140 pounds. Yanqiu, suffering from his own weight, asked him about the method of losing weight. Mr. You advised him to eat vegetarian food and practice exercise routines. After the topic of health had passed, they extensively discussed drama. I said that I could not accurately remember the melody of the second phrase of the "zheng ban yi huang" aria in "Suo Lin Nang," which goes from low to high and then back to low. Yanqiu then hummed it softly twice, and said that he had taken a passage from a Xipi melody and incorporated it. Father said that in order to adapt to the needs of modern society, we must broadly search and adopt, not be limited to adhering to the past. For example, the "crying head" of "Er de Niang a" is a triple repetition, which was taken from a section of MacDonald's singing in the movie "The Phoenix Seeks His Mate." Everyone laughed when they heard this. His adoption of Western music can be described as a surprising victory. Who would know its origin? He also said that the distinctions between "jian" and "tuan" sounds and "shang kou" words in singing and dialogue should be preserved. I said that I agreed with this most strongly. The clarity of the initial sounds of words is especially important because one person is singing on stage, and hundreds or thousands of people are listening in the audience, some sitting very far away. If the sounds of the words sung on stage cannot be heard clearly below, it would be very disappointing. I then raised a question, saying that in performing drama, one should use twelve points of strength, and even more so in the current time of need, there must be a powerful expression to achieve the effect of awakening the deaf and enlightening the blind. Yanqiu said that his view is that the "dan" (female) roles are different from the "sheng" (male) roles, emphasizing beautification, and that expressing six or seven points is sufficient. If it reaches nine points, it seems excessive. The veteran playwright Mr. Jiang Zicheng agreed with Cheng's remarks. I added that in romantic dramas, subtlety is of course wonderful, and expressing five points is enough; but in tragic dramas, even expressing ten points still feels not painful enough. I will give an example. In the Yuan drama "The Injustice of Dou E," Dou E is a widow who is unjustly beheaded, and her blood sprays onto a banner. After three years, her father finally avenges her. It is purely a tragedy, and the singing and dialogue are intense, which can move heaven and earth and make ghosts and spirits weep. In the Kunqu opera "Jin Suo Ji," the story is changed, with the addition of being pardoned before execution and a reunion with her husband. The Kunqu troupes perform this on important days, the sound as if silk is being torn. I have heard it, but when it is converted into Pi Huang, the expressive power feels somewhat lacking. In the past, when Yanqiu performed this, the various arias and movements in the Fan Er Huang and Yao Ban styles moved the audience. The expressiveness was indeed sufficient. This time, this play was performed three times, but I did not hear any of them. I do not know how it compares to previous years. I very much hope that Mr. Cheng will write a new play in the future to try out my ideas. I remember seeing the movie "Resurrection," where the female lead's performance was so powerful, like a dragon or a tiger, which made a deep impression on me and can serve as secondary evidence for my argument. There were many discussions, but due to space limitations, I cannot elaborate and will end here.

### Tang Ruoqing Arrives in Guilin

— Hua Er

After "China Travel Agency's Ah Q," Zhou Yibai's "Li Xiangjun" will be staged. The author believes that Tang Ruoqing is the most suitable for the role of Li Xiangjun, so her father, Tang Huaiqiu, has already sent a telegram urging his daughter to return, so that "Li Xiangjun" can follow "Ah Q" on schedule (scheduled for June 1st). At the same time, the two daughters in "Wen Daxian" are also planned to be played by Ruoqing and Xiangqing respectively. However, yesterday I received a letter from a friend in Hong Kong saying that Tang Ruoyu suddenly left for Guilin. It is not very clear whether she is going to participate in Ouyang Yuqian's South China Theater. After receiving the letter, the reporter has sent a letter to Guilin and will report the details to readers after receiving a reply.
