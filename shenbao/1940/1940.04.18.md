When they arrived at the station, nearby people rushed forward to pay their respects.

In the evening, Head Pan broadcasted to overseas Chinese from the International Broadcasting Station, reporting on his impressions along the way and the situation upon arriving in Chongqing.

### The Provisional Capital Prohibits Banquets for Party, Government, and Military Personnel; Except for the Reception of Foreign Guests and Banquets Due to Official Business, Social Banquets Are Strictly Prohibited

Chongqing: Chairman Chiang believes that frugality and thrift are the great principles of governing the country. During the war of resistance, it is especially important to be diligent and self-disciplined. For two years of the war of resistance, the front line has been fighting fiercely, but the rear has become more luxurious.

### Shao Lizi Will Go to the Soviet Union Next Month

Chongqing: A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Shao Lizi, the newly appointed ambassador to the Soviet Union, on the morning of the 17th, and asked about his impressions after being appointed and the date of his departure. He said that the relationship between China and the Soviet Union is extremely close, and the diplomatic relations between the two countries are also quite sincere.

Therefore, on a personal level, he is especially happy to revisit the progressive Soviet Union after fourteen years. As for the date of departure to the Soviet Union, it was originally scheduled to be within a few days, but due to official and personal affairs, it is necessary to take care of them, and the dental disease has not yet healed (it is expected that it will be possible to set off in the middle of next month).

The Japanese government is extremely anxious and is working hard to devise countermeasures. (17th dispatch)

Editorial

### Latin America Under the Threat of Aggression

On the 15th of this month, U.S. President Roosevelt delivered a speech at the Pan American Union, in which he praised the great achievements of mutual assistance and mutual benefit among American countries in maintaining peace. He further warned the residents of the Americas with the unfortunate events that have occurred in the Eastern Hemisphere, urging them to be vigilant and seek self-defense together, so as to ensure the lasting peace of the ideal of the cow. His words are earnest and far-sighted, which is enough to show Mr. Luo's ambition to be compassionate to the world. At a time when the wildfire of war continues to spread and the atrocities of aggression are endless, hearing it is almost like hearing the sound of footsteps in an empty valley. However, the safety problem of the Americas is not easy to talk about today.

Since the advancement of transportation technology, the distance between various parts of the world has been shortened day by day. Any corner of the earth should be regarded as a part of the whole world. The distinction between the old and new worlds has completely lost its original meaning. Although Latin America has a short history of national establishment and has little connection with major issues in world politics, and its interests are only limited to the Americas, it cannot but be affected by the fluctuations of the world political tide. During the Great War from 1914 to 1919, although Latin American countries remained neutral in the beginning, they eventually had to join the war one after another. This is one thing. Recently, the European war has expanded, Denmark has fallen, and the Netherlands is in danger. The Dutch territories in the Western Hemisphere have formed a heavy burden on the American countries, and they are concerned about how to deal with the coming events. This is another matter. However, this is not only true for the Pan American countries, but also for the Eskimos and the vassal states at the foot of the Himalayas, who cannot but be shocked by the European situation. However, the main crux of the crisis in Latin America lies in the continuous invasion of the power of the aggressive countries and the incomplete and proper human affairs of the countries concerned. Therefore, even though the United States is the leader of the Americas and has unparalleled strength, its Pan American movement seems to lack sufficient confidence to deal with the dark shadows of aggression.

More than a hundred years ago, the United States unveiled the Monroe Doctrine to resist other countries' interference in American politics. Although it was effective, it failed to completely prevent the intrusion of external political heat. Over the years, German, Italian, and Japanese people have continued to immigrate to the New World. During the First European War, Germany once attempted to use Mexico as a shortcut to attack the United States. After the war, the power of these three countries in the Americas expanded more quickly. Although their economic power is not enough to compete with the United Kingdom and the United States, they have been carrying out propaganda and conspiracy in politics, and they are gradually trying to use their totalitarian theory to manipulate the internal affairs of various countries. In the past few years, political changes in Latin America have been frequent, and they have almost all been related to this conspiracy. Although countries such as Mexico, Cuba, and Chile have more open and progressive political platforms and are powerful bastions of democratic power in Central and South America, and the United States is also committed to preventing aggression and ensuring security, it is not enough to curb the overflow of this reactionary force. Although Japan started later and its foundation is not enough to compete with Germany, it is still diligently engaged and spares no effort. El Salvador's support of the side and recognition of Manchukuo, past events are small and far away, have shown a glimpse of the results of Japanese activities. In recent years, the concessions it has acquired in countries such as Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Heixico, and Panama mostly have military value and are enough to threaten the Plata River region and the security of the Americas. Since the United States abolished the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, Japan has been working hard to manage diplomatic relations with Central and South America, hoping to receive the effect of the Sangyu. This month, delegations from various Latin American countries have traveled to Japan one after another to conduct negotiations on business and trade with Japan. Japan will also send Kato Sotome as a special envoy to repay the visit to various Central and South American countries after Kawai, and will host a South American envoys conference in Brazil's capital in May. The effectiveness of this active operation is still unknown, but it can be determined that it will make Japan's power deeply rooted in Latin America, echoing Germany and Italy's instigation, and make the United States' economic weapons against Japan suffer partial setbacks.

In terms of the Central and South American countries themselves, even with the organization of the Pan American Alliance, their steps and postures have not been able to help each other and fight together for the security, well-being and welfare of the Americas. In terms of political ideology: some are willing to tolerate and promote the plans and activities of the Fascists and aggressors, while others are striving to support the democratic movement and regard totalitarianism as a foe. In terms of economic relations, the interests of each country are different, and there are certain contradictions between them, which often provide opportunities for people to horizontally and vertically separate. For example, the recent Pan American Conference advocated the establishment of a Pan American Bank to provide loans to various countries to increase trade with the United States. The attitudes of various countries towards this are inconsistent, some are hesitant, and some are even publicly opposed. On the other hand, various countries are eager to respond to Japan's attempts to increase trade, and they are willing to be its tail without resigning. How unwise is it? However, even enlightened authorities such as Mexico cannot avoid forgetting righteousness for the sake of immediate interests and secretly providing grain to the thieves, let alone others. This is what the US authorities, who regard Pan-American security as their responsibility, and all knowledgeable people in the Americas should pay close attention to.

Now the threat of war has gradually reached the Americas. After President Roosevelt's loud appeal, all the people and authorities of Latin America should urgently seek ways to deal with it. If they are willing to be the platform for the aggressors and regard letting go of their political and economic offensives as a good idea, it is no different from harming themselves, and future hidden worries will be endless. If not, then they should carefully consider and implement President Roosevelt's words, "The countries of the Americas must consult each other on whether we are threatened with annihilation, and work together to defend ourselves," so as to eliminate the source of chaos in the future and make a powerful defense of international justice and fairness, so that the aggressors will not secretly laugh at their greed alone being able to succeed in Latin America.

### Japan's Potential Occupation of the Dutch East Indies: Britain and France Will Not Allow It; US-British Cooperation in the Far East Possible; East Indies Government Continues to Maintain Special Alert

Paris – A French Foreign Ministry spokesman declared today that Britain and France will definitely not allow Japan to invade Sumatra, Java, Borneo, or New Guinea, territories of the Dutch East Indies located south of the Philippines. This has led France to believe that if Japan attempts to occupy the Dutch East Indies, the United States will certainly step in to confront them. The communiqué also stated that if Japan allows Britain and France to extend their blockade policy to the Sea of Japan to cut off the route of American goods to Vladivostok, France may be able to sign an agreement with Japan. (United Press, 17th)

Budapest – The pro-Central Powers newspaper "Magyar Szemle" here yesterday quoted President Roosevelt's speech on the Dutch East Indies issue, attacking aggressor nations, stating that President Roosevelt's speech is sufficient to stir American sentiment. It also stated that under such circumstances, President Roosevelt made this speech because he believed that the right moment had matured to inform the nation of the US government's intentions regarding the international situation. The newspaper also believes that British and American cooperation in the Far East is possible in the future. (United Press, 17th)

Hong Kong – Tokyo dispatch, according to Batavia, Dutch East Indies, the East Indies government is silent on the possibility of the Netherlands being drawn into the European war and is unwilling to comment. However, the authorities have today continued to maintain alert measures, ordering police and special guard teams to be stationed around post offices, telegraph offices, trains, and wireless telecommunications agencies. Dutch expatriates in the East Indies believe that (1) the Netherlands is determined to adhere to its policy of neutrality, and neither the Dutch mainland nor the Dutch East Indies wishes to be drawn into the European war; (2) based on its neutral stance, the Netherlands will not actively seek protection from one or more third countries, so unless the Netherlands makes a suggestion, Britain and the United States will not take any measures to protect the Dutch East Indies; (3) once the Dutch mainland is drawn into the war, communication between the East Indies and the homeland will easily be cut off, but even so, politically, the East Indies will not undergo any changes. The government of the Dutch East Indies will naturally be strengthened and still ruled by the Netherlands. (16th dispatch)

Amsterdam – Responsible parties here firmly refute the notion that if the Netherlands is invaded, its overseas territories will be placed under the protection of foreigners. They assert that even if the Netherlands is trampled upon, the Dutch East Indies will still remain an unconquered part of the Netherlands. According to reports from here, in the event of a sudden change in European affairs that disrupts communication between the Netherlands and its Indian government, the Dutch Indian government will still be able to continue governing India without external assistance or protection. The Dutch East Indies possesses naval and land forces whose strength cannot be ignored by any country. (Reuters, 17th)

The Hague – Observers here say that the fate of the Dutch East Indies archipelago, should the Netherlands be forced to join the current European war, has become the focus of attention. Government authorities and the general public, after careful study, all believe that the speech made yesterday by US President Roosevelt is of particular importance. In general, no matter how strong a certain country's ambitions in the Indian Ocean may be, the United States is the natural protector of the Dutch territories there. Therefore, any sign that proves the American public's increasing concern for the European situation is welcomed by the Dutch government and the public. President Roosevelt's speech yesterday is one such sign. The "General Summary" newspaper here also published an article praising it, stating briefly that President Roosevelt, in his historical speech delivered in Chicago in October 1937, had likened aggressor nations to plagues that must be quarantined. Since taking office, the president's consistent policy has been to oppose military aggression. From yesterday's speech, it can be seen that this policy has not changed. The "Maasbode" newspaper also stated that the United States' conservative neutrality is the same as Italy's non-participation in the war, but the latter is inclined toward Germany, while the former shares common ideas with Britain and France. As of today, the strength of isolationist forces within the United States cannot be underestimated, which is undeniable. However, it is also a fact that public opinion in that country increasingly feels that the United States will one day fight shoulder to shoulder with Britain and France. (Havas Agency, 16th)

Japanese and Italian Diplomatic Maneuvering

London – Today, all newspapers here are paying close attention to Japan's sudden expression of concern regarding the future of the Dutch East Indies after the Netherlands was drawn into the war. The "News Chronicle" reported that Foreign Minister Arita's remarks, coinciding with the Italian newspapers' agitation of anti-British sentiment and the German-spread rumors of the Allied powers' plan to undermine Dutch neutrality, are simultaneously forming a large-scale diplomatic tactic aimed at intimidating the Allied powers and diverting their war efforts in Scandinavia, while also alarming the Mediterranean and the Pacific. However, Britain's primary task of defeating the Germans will not be hindered by this. The actions of Japan and Italy are not enough to keep the British up at night. A Reuters correspondent in Amsterdam reported that Dutch political figures have recalled that the integrity of the East Indies was guaranteed by the Allied powers, the United States, and Japan at the 1922 Washington Conference. Therefore, Japan's concern is premature, and the naval and land forces of the Dutch East Indies will make any attack on its territory extremely dangerous. (Reuters, 17th)

French Newspapers Comment on the Fate of the Dutch East Indies

Paris – Ms. Tabouis, a renowned reporter for the "L'Œuvre" newspaper, recently published an article commenting on the Dutch East Indies archipelago, stating briefly, "When Japan and Germany signed the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1936, Hitler offered Japan a promise that if it could conclude a treaty of alliance with Germany, the Dutch East Indies would be the reward. The German ambassador to Japan, Ott, recently reiterated this suggestion to Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, but the foreign minister knew that if Germany invaded the Netherlands, the United States would take the Dutch East Indies under its protection. Upon hearing this, Japan was greatly shocked. According to the latest news, Japan is indeed very worried that the United States will get there first. Therefore, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita recently notified the Dutch government that during the current European war, Japan would not tolerate the Dutch East Indies archipelago being protected by the navy of another strong country. However, as far as the United States is concerned, the Dutch East Indies archipelago annually ships a large amount of raw materials, especially rubber, to the United States. Therefore, the United States would not welcome any invasion of these islands by Japan, even if it were a partial invasion. This is very obvious." (Havas Agency, 17th)

Paris – The "People's Daily," the organ of the Socialist Party, commented on Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's remarks regarding the Dutch East Indies issue, stating that even a large China is not enough to fill the insatiable desires of the executors of the Tanaka Memorial, as can be seen from Arita's remarks. Foreign Minister Arita stated that Japan is determined to oppose the spread of the European war to the Western Pacific and to oppose any belligerent nation controlling the Dutch East Indies archipelago. In reality, since Germany has been excluded from the Pacific, the only threat that Japan sees to these islands comes from Britain, France, or the United States. Therefore, if Germany invades the Netherlands, what will be the fate of the Dutch East Indies? Will Britain and France protect it from attack by other countries, just as they protected Iceland after Germany invaded Denmark? In fact, the Netherlands, Britain, and France have no intention of harming Japan's interests. On the contrary, if Japan takes any action against the East Indies, it will definitely cause a major reaction from the United States. As a result, Japan's economic interests in the region, even if no one actually intends to threaten them, will be completely lost because the country insists on asserting its so-called defense." (Havas Agency, 17th)

Paris – "Le Figaro" newspaper here commented on Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's remarks regarding the Dutch East Indies issue, stating briefly, "Events occurring in various parts of the world are actually interconnected. Japan has now shown its position on this issue, which is of concern to all countries, especially the United States." (Havas Agency, 17th)

Washington – Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's remarks, forbidding others from interfering in the Dutch East Indies affair, have attracted much attention from officials here. However, this sentiment is not equivalent to panic. According to general opinion, Japan will think twice before acting, and will not hastily clash with Britain and France in the Far East when the Netherlands is drawn into the war. News commentators believe that Britain and France have a vital stake in the region and will act immediately, so there is no need for the United States to intervene. However, if Japan takes action against the Dutch East Indies, an uncontrollable reaction will inevitably erupt in the United States, thus strengthening the widespread sentiment against Japan's imperial ambitions in the Far East. (Reuters, 17th)

New York – After Japanese Foreign Minister Arita made a statement yesterday, explaining his attitude on the Dutch East Indies issue, the "People's Voice Forum" newspaper here criticized it harshly, stating briefly, "If peace in the Dutch East Indies is disrupted, Japan certainly has the right to regard this as unease, but the limit of this is exactly the same as Japan disrupting the peace of China, which Britain, the United States, and other countries also have the right to regard as unease. The two are exactly equal. Moreover, Japan's dependence on raw materials and manufactured goods produced in the Dutch East Indies is far less than that of Britain and the United States, so there is no need for Japan to interfere. In the past decade, Japan has been the main destroyer of peace in East Asia. Now, it is demanding to extend its police power to the South Seas, even to the vicinity of the Philippines. This behavior will only arouse ridicule and resentment in Britain. Moreover, Japan is already deeply mired in the quagmire of China, lacking both money and resources. If it attempts to establish naval dominance at the door of the British port of Singapore, it will inevitably collapse in the war and lose the respect it currently holds in the United States. In short, it is said that Japan is looking for a place to bury itself. If so, then the South Seas issue is probably it." (Havas Agency, 17th)

New York – The "New York Daily News" recently published an article expressing doubt about whether the United States can protect the Dutch East Indies, but advocating that the United States should protect the Dutch East Indies. The newspaper stated, "It is doubtful whether we can protect the Dutch East Indies from Japanese aggression. What we are concerned about with the Kingdom of the Netherlands is what will happen to the Dutch East Indies once Dutch sovereignty is extinguished in the war. Regardless of what happens to the Kingdom of the Netherlands itself, we should maintain the eternal existence of the Dutch East Indies, which is what the Monroe Doctrine should do."

Japanese Explanation of Arita's Remarks

Tokyo – A Foreign Ministry spokesman, in a meeting with reporters today, answering a question about whether the Netherlands would be invaded by European belligerent countries, said that there are currently various rumors and observations about the European war spreading to that part of the world. Therefore, Foreign Minister Arita made a statement (regarding Japan's position on the Dutch's involvement in the European war and its repercussions in the Dutch East Indies), stating Japan's desire to maintain the safety and peace of the Pacific region. Asked whether Arita's remarks reiterated the Four-Power Treaty of 1922, the spokesman acknowledged that the treaty was still valid and said that Arita's remarks aimed to prevent the spread of the European war to the Pacific region. The most important thing was the economic aspect of the relationship between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. When the Japanese Diet convened a meeting, Arita, in answering questions, explicitly stated that the Japanese government was only economically concerned about the South Seas region, including the Dutch East Indies. A foreign reporter asked whether this statement was inspired by the Asian Monroe Doctrine. The spokesman replied that the term "Asian Monroe Doctrine" has been abused in many ways or used in an expanded sense. Therefore, it is inappropriate to call the spirit that inspired the Foreign Minister's statement the Asian Monroe Doctrine. The purpose of the Foreign Minister's statement is quite simple, namely to maintain Japan's special interests in the regions adjacent to its homeland. The spokesman also mentioned that Vice-Foreign Minister Masano Tani and Dutch Ambassador to Japan Pabst met yesterday afternoon, saying that this conversation was unrelated to Arita's remarks. The two talked only about routine matters. Arita invited Pabst to the Foreign Ministry half an hour after making the statement to reporters at 5:00 PM on Sunday to formally explain the content of his remarks. The Dutch ambassador then relayed this information to his home government. However, the Japanese government did not expect a response from the Dutch government, and the content of the statement was not submitted to any other foreign government. Pabst did not criticize Arita's statement. (Reuters, 17th)

Central Government Concerned About Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies

Chongqing – The Kuomintang headquarters in charge of overseas Chinese affairs is now telling the press that, in light of Japan's possible actions in the South Seas, they are particularly concerned about the 1.3 million overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies. The Chinese residents of the Dutch East Indies gradually migrated to this place over 2,000 years. Their investments in agriculture, banking, and insurance in the region total 400 million Dutch guilders. It is also said that the overseas Chinese residing in Java and Sumatra migrated there as early as the Han Dynasty, 2,000 years ago. Foreign military experts here say that if Japan invades, it will first occupy Borneo. The Japanese regard this place as a strategically important military location for all the islands of the Dutch East Indies. Moreover, Borneo is an area that produces large amounts of oil, which makes it even more attractive. Borneo's coal is currently operated by the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company. It is said that the company is prepared to destroy the oil wells in the event of a Japanese invasion. It is generally believed that the Japanese Navy will carefully plan how to acquire the oil of Borneo in order to prevent the destruction of the oil wells. It is also generally believed that the Japanese will first occupy Java, as Java is the political and commercial center of the Dutch East Indies. (Associated Press, 17th)

### Continued Excavation of Han Dynasty Tomb in Chongqing Suburbs

Chongqing – Excavation of the fourth Han Dynasty tomb in Jiangbei continued on the 17th. In addition to clearing sediment, a broken pottery urn was unearthed at the bottom of the tomb entrance. Also, dozens of steps away from the fourth tomb, a Han Dynasty tomb was also unearthed previously near the company during land excavation for building houses. The patterns on the bricks also included the words "" (wealth and honor). Among them, dozens of coins, one bronze tripod, two bronze basins, and fragments of bronze "" were also unearthed. The form of "" with bronze utensils proves its age. The first, second, and third Han tombs previously excavated were tombs from the late Western Han Dynasty. The patterns on the bricks of the currently excavated fourth tomb are simple and ancient, and may be tombs from the early Western Han Dynasty. (17th dispatch)

### Allied Forces Continue Landing in Norway; Fierce Fighting in Scandinavia; German Troops Advance Along Railway Lines Towards Swedish Border; Encounter Resistance in the North and Begin Contact with British Forces

London – British, French, and Canadian troops are continuing to land in Norway, but detailed information is being kept secret and will be released in a few days. According to political figures here, the main force of the German troops invading Norway is in the south and is trying to advance towards the center, hoping to connect with the troops currently in various Norwegian ports, paying particular attention to Trondheim. Trondheim has two railway lines, one leading to Sweden and the other to Oslo. However, the route from southern Norway to Trondheim is long and rugged, and the railway line from Trondheim to Oslo has been cut in several places by Norwegian troops, and the entire line is frequently attacked, making transportation extremely difficult. Therefore, the advance of the main German force will inevitably be hindered by Norwegian resistance, allowing the British, French, and Canadian troops to calmly land and prevent the Germans from doing as they please. The main goal of the Allied military authorities is to occupy northern Norway in order to control the North Atlantic and block the transportation routes between Norway and Sweden. This would put Swedish iron ore within easy reach and allow British and French troops to provide nearby assistance if Germany invades Sweden in the future. Therefore, Sweden was relieved to hear that British and French troops had landed in Narvik. In short, the recent victories of the British and French navies prove that the possibility of German troops in Norway receiving supplies by sea is decreasing, and they will have to rely on air transport. This means that while troop transport for the Allies may be slow, it is very convenient. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)

Stockholm – In the early stages of the invasion of Norway, German troops advanced north to intercept King Haakon of Norway and the Norwegian government, but they are still attacking Elverum without success. According to dispatches from the Swedish border, Norwegian troops in the Elverum area are firmly defending the bridges over the Glomma River, and heavy snowfall is hindering the German mechanized units. The Norwegian troops, following the example of the Finnish troops, are sending suicide squads on sleds to harass the German troops and cut off their supply lines, while the civilians are helping to hide food. According to the "Aftonbladet" newspaper, the rearguard of the Norwegian troops withdrew from Kongsvinger yesterday, and it is expected that the German and Norwegian troops will soon engage in a decisive battle for Elverum and Hamar. It is reported that the German troops in the far southeast have occupied the entire Aust-Agder province, and the Norwegian troops will now cross the Swedish border or head north to connect with the Norwegian troops defending the eastern front. According to news from the border, "reliable sources" estimate that there are a total of 60,000 German troops in Norway. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

Stockholm – According to news from Kiruna, there has been a small skirmish between the reconnaissance teams of the German and Norwegian troops in Riksgränsen, northern Norway, a few kilometers from the Swedish border. The "Aftonbladet" newspaper published an extra edition reporting that there was also fighting in the village of Bjørnfjell, near the Swedish border. (Haitong dispatch on the 17th)

London – According to a Finnish radio station, the German troops advancing from Trondheim seem to be cutting Norway in two and are now only a few miles from Storlien on the Swedish border.

After a fierce battle, the German troops occupied Djupdalen, and the remaining 200 Norwegian troops retreated into Sweden. The "Nidaros" newspaper also stated that the German troops now control the railway from Narvik to the border, and part of Narvik is still in German hands, while several British warships are anchored in the harbor. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

Berlin – The German troops in Narvik, advancing along the railway, reached the Swedish border yesterday.

German Troops in Northern Norway in a Dilemma

Stockholm – Fierce fighting is currently taking place near the Swedish border east of Narvik in northern Norway. It is believed that the German troops have occupied the railway from Narvik to Östersund (half a mile from the Swedish border). Kongsvinger has also fallen, and a team of Norwegian troops has retreated into Sweden and been disarmed and interned. In addition, a German bomber has landed in the Swedish town of Värmlandsnäs, and the crew has also been interned. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)

Stockholm – Today, there are approximately 2,000 to 2,500 German troops in Narvik, northern Norway, facing a dilemma. These 2,000+ troops are facing the choice of perishing in battle, surrendering, or fighting their way out. In the streets of Narvik, British and German troops have engaged in fierce fighting. Although a small team of German troops crossed the mountains and entered Sweden, the main force of the German troops based on the Rombak Plateau is threatened by the intense shelling of British warships and can only shorten their lines of defense. Between Narvik and the Swedish border, the bodies of German and Norwegian soldiers are strewn everywhere, most of whom have frozen to death in the snow. There are over 1,000 bodies of German, Norwegian, and British sailors and merchants at the bottom of Narvik harbor, making it a graveyard for warships and merchant ships from the three countries. One of the sunken ships is said to be a British cruiser. It is reported that all the German troops in Narvik are now isolated, and their supply lines have been cut. Their only hope is for aircraft to drop supplies to them. The British troops in Narvik are currently trying to drive the German troops towards the railway leading from Narvik through the mountains and into the snowy mountain region, where they will surround them and then bombard them with artillery from warships anchored in the Rombak Fjord. The only place for the German troops to retreat is 23 kilometers along the railway from the area where the British warships plan to bombard them. The Rombak Fjord is the entrance to this continuous snowy mountain region, and Narvik is located in the southwest corner of the fjord. Beyond the Rombak Fjord is the Rombak Plateau, which is 18 miles from the Norwegian border and has towering mountains and overlapping peaks, leaving the German troops with no way out. The railway leading to Narvik has also been damaged by Norwegian troops. (United Press dispatch on the 17th)

Norwegian Army Commander-in-Chief Encourages Troops

Stockholm – General Ruge, Commander-in-Chief of the Norwegian Army, recently issued a message to the nation, stating that our country was attacked suddenly, and we were unable to resist immediately. However, the situation has now changed, and we are no longer isolated. Britain and France have both provided us with assistance, and British troops have landed in our country. While we are waiting for the Allied forces to exert their strength, we must train our own elite troops to resist. Currently, the German troops are scattered in various locations, and without regular transportation, they cannot support each other. All the important routes are cut off by our troops, and they can only use aircraft for transport and supply, which is a very unfavorable situation. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)

London – The German radio station acknowledged last night that Allied troops have landed in Norway, reportedly in places such as Harstad, 50 miles north of Narvik.

### Stavanger Airport Bombing Situation Recounted by Returning British Airmen

London – According to British airmen who returned from bombing the German airfield in Stavanger, Norway, a few days ago, the German side suffered heavy losses in the final air raid. It is said that British aircraft roared over the German airfield in Stavanger for an hour that night, dropping a large number of explosive and incendiary bombs on a clear moonlit night. German aircraft, air defense equipment, and other buildings parked at the airfield caught fire and burned, and the flames soared high into the sky. Although the British aircraft encountered German anti-aircraft fire, none were injured and all returned safely. The British Air Ministry also released photos taken by British aircraft of the airfield before the bombing, showing 12 German aircraft parked at the airfield. (United Press dispatch on the 17th)

London – The Air Ministry recently announced that "the German High Command has claimed that British aircraft lost a total of five aircraft yesterday, including a Lockheed aircraft, which was shot down while bombing Stavanger, Norway, and three Short Sunderland flying boats were destroyed by German forces. This statement is completely unfounded. In fact, none of our aircraft were shot down during our bombing of Stavanger yesterday, and we did not lose any flying boats. However, it is true that two of our aircraft patrolling the North Sea have not returned to base. It is understood that all of our aircraft that flew to Stavanger last night to bomb the German airfield were long-range heavy bombers, dropping bombs with tremendous explosive power for an hour and using incendiary bombs, causing significant damage to the airfield."

### Allied War Aims Explained in Eden's Speech

London – Dominions Secretary Anthony Eden stated in a speech here today that Germany's war of aggression aims to make Germany the most powerful country in the world and to brutally wield this power to force Europe to submit to German rule and to force the world to accept Germany's prestige. The Allies' war aims are not only to maintain the status quo but also to maintain the possibility of progress. The nameless now view British imperialism as a murky relic of a dishonorable past, and we must eliminate this corrupt idea. In fact, this is not the case, and it is a bridge to the next era. All who acknowledge this should know that the future belongs to us, and we are not the rulers of the empire but merely its servants. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

### Before German Invasion of Norway, Twelve Conditions Were Presented, Which No Independent Nation Could Accept

The members of the commission are all social leaders, and Chairman Dr. Klinth Jensen is particularly trusted by the people. (Haitong dispatch on the 17th)

Berlin – The German High Command issued a war bulletin this afternoon, describing the situation in the last 24 hours, stating that German reinforcements arrived in Norway yesterday and took measures to protect important railway lines. In the Narvik area, the railway occupied by our troops is gradually approaching the Swedish border.

### German-Italian-Soviet Triangle Alliance Once Again Rumored; German Foreign Minister to Visit Soviet Union

Stockholm – The "Svenska Dagbladet" recently carried a report from Moscow stating that Germany is once again seeking to form a German-Italian-Soviet alliance, and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is preparing to visit Moscow for the third time to discuss this matter. It is reported that Germany has decided to allow the Soviet Union to act freely with regard to the Bessarabia province of Romania. However, Soviet political figures believe that Germany's attempt is to bring Italy and the Soviet Union closer to each other and to force Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to visit Berlin in return, which will ultimately fail. In short, although the Soviet Union is still providing economic assistance to Germany, its nature is not very important. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)

Paris – Observers here recently stated that Germany is concentrating troops near the Yugoslav border, the Carinthia region of Austria, and the Hungarian border. This is related to the Soviet Union's transfer of troops from Finland to the border of the Bessarabia province of Romania, and Italy's dispatch of 25,000 "tenant farmers" to Albania. Germany originally wanted to form a Berlin-Rome-Moscow triangle to maintain the status quo in the Balkans, but the current situation is the opposite. This triangle has become an element of instability in southeastern Europe. It is unknown whether the authorities of these powers have decided to take joint action, but none of them will allow the other two to gain benefits. Therefore, each country is now preparing separately to intervene immediately if one of them takes action. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)

### Mussolini's Speech on War and Peace Suddenly Postponed Indefinitely

Rome – The board meeting of the Rome World's Fair, originally scheduled for Saturday, and the rumored speech by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini on the issue of war and peace, have now been postponed indefinitely.

When the supervisor of the World's Fair submitted the first report last year, the Italian Prime Minister said that if the Italian government harbored war ideas, it would not carry out the great project of the World's Fair.

### U.S. Government Recognizes Greenland within the Monroe Doctrine; Not Based on Germany's Desire to Occupy as a Base; Hull States No Intention to Extend Protection; U.S. Replies to Iceland Willing to Establish Direct Relations

Washington – U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated to news reporters yesterday that the U.S. has not discussed the status of the Dutch East Indies with Japan. Hull feigned ignorance of rumors that the U.S. would protect Greenland or plans for Canadian troops to land there. Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador to the U.K. Lothian stated that unless Germany attempts to establish a base in Greenland, Britain and Canada do not intend to occupy Greenland. He believes Greenland falls within the scope of the Monroe Doctrine. (United Press, 17th)

Washington – British Ambassador to the U.S. Lothian, after speaking with U.S. State Department personnel yesterday, told news reporters that Britain or Canada do not intend to invade unless Germany truly seeks to seize Greenland or Iceland. Although Greenland could be a good air force base for Germany, Germany definitely cannot maintain it, as we can easily inflict a major blow there. Greenland is within the Western Hemisphere and therefore within the scope of the Monroe Doctrine. He expects the British naval blockade to be applied in the Pacific to prevent supplies shipped from the American Pacific coast from entering Germany via the Soviet Union. When Secretary of State Hull was hosting news reporters, he was asked if the U.S. would extend its protection over Greenland. Hull replied that he was unaware of any such plan. However, Hull mentioned President Roosevelt's recent remarks referring to Greenland as land in the Western Hemisphere, suggesting that he clearly recognizes Greenland as being within the scope of the Monroe Doctrine. (Reuters, 17th)

Washington – After the Icelandic government sent a note to the U.S., declaring its separation from Denmark and expressing its willingness to establish direct relations with the U.S., Secretary of State Hull promptly cabled Iceland's Prime Minister Hermann Jónasson, stating, "In the current circumstances, the U.S. government welcomes the Icelandic government's dispatch of a representative to our country, and we hope that in the near future, our country can also dispatch a representative to your country." As for whether the representatives to be exchanged will be ministers or consuls, it is still unknown. (Havas, 17th)

### Rumor of Soviet Proposal to Adjust Relations with Japan; Negotiations Reportedly Underway; Soviet Consul in Harbin Visits Japanese Consul

Tokyo – It is rumored that the Soviet Union, in preparation for action in the Scandinavian Peninsula, the Balkans, or the Near East, has begun negotiations with Japan to adjust Japanese-Soviet relations and secure its rear. According to a report in the Chung Wai Commercial News, Soviet Foreign Trade Commissioner Mikoyan invited the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union on April 15th to discuss several important proposals for a general adjustment of Soviet-Japanese relations. It is widely believed that these proposals are of particular significance because their purpose is to test the extent to which the Japanese government's policy of non-intervention in the expanding European war will go. The newspaper also stated that the Soviet Union, when the situation in Europe reaches a point where it can begin its active operations in Scandinavia, the Balkans, or the Near East, is eager to determine its Far Eastern policy and the security of its rear. (Reuters, 17th)

Tokyo – According to a semi-official Japanese source from Harbin, the newly appointed Soviet Consul General in Harbin, when visiting the Japanese Consul General there, stated that the Soviet Union and Japan should spare no sacrifice to readjust their relations and should work together based on mutual friendship to bring the two countries closer, and that negotiations should be conducted based on the new situation in East Asia to seek a general improvement in the overall situation in East Asia. (Reuters, 17th)

Tokyo – Former Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Toshio Shiratori, recently published an essay in the April issue of "Creation Magazine," advocating the signing of a five-year non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. His main points were: "Germany, after assessing the Soviet Union for a year, has trusted its sincerity and resolutely fought against Britain and France. If Japan signs a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, it can at least trust the Soviet Union within the term stipulated in the treaty. Regarding this matter, Japan can put forward three proposals: (1) Withdraw troops concentrated on both sides of the Soviet-Manchukuo border; (2) Request the Soviet government to cease aiding the Chinese Nationalist government in Chongqing; (3) Redefine the Soviet-Manchukuo border to prevent future incidents. If these proposals can be realized, then the non-aggression treaty can be easily declared. As for why some Japanese are hesitant about Germany acting as an intermediary between Japan and the Soviet Union, it is difficult to understand. In addition, it is also a matter of course for Japan to cooperate with Germany and Italy, as this move will accelerate the resolution of the 'China Incident'." (Havas, 16th)

### Japanese Government Bonds Increase Unabated; Public Absorption Stagnant; Inflation Has Already Occurred

Tokyo – According to reliable sources, the amount of government bonds that the Japanese government will issue in the current fiscal year, starting in April, is feared to be no less than ¥6,026,900,000. In addition, there are ¥1,700,000,000 of government bonds accumulated from last year that have not yet been issued, which will also be issued, so the total amount should be ¥7,800,000,000. Public absorption of bonds is gradually stagnating, which is a sign of inflation. Although the true power to control currency does not rest with the authorities of the Bank of Japan, they cannot be completely unrelated to the current financial situation. The Bank of Japan's surplus also greatly increased last year. It is said that the main reason for this is the increase in interest on government bonds. This artificial increase in surplus reflects the huge amount of government bonds currently outstanding. As of the end of last year, the Bank of Japan held ¥2,417,450,000 in Japanese government bonds. This number is ¥659,000,000 more than in 1938 and ¥578,000,000 more than in 1937. Although the current reserves are not small, they will continue to increase in the future.

### Foreign Minister Spaak Reaffirms Belgium's Neutrality; Will Defend Its Territory with All Its Might if Invaded

Brussels – Foreign Minister Spaak delivered a speech in the Senate, explaining Belgium's attitude toward the current European war. He said, "In the past eight days, two neutral countries have been attacked and invaded. We express our sincere respect to these two countries, which have always been able to maintain complete neutrality, especially Norway. We not only pay tribute to them but also take them as a model and learn from them." Since the abolition of the Locarno Pact, our country has adopted a purely independent policy. "The governments of Britain, France, and Germany have all provided guarantees for the territorial integrity of our country. We will faithfully abide by our moral obligations to those countries. This is a card we hold in our hand and will never give up. As for the precautionary measures we have taken, their goal is to avoid our country becoming a European battlefield again. No country in the world willingly becomes a place for others to compete. We deeply know the way to self-reliance, so we have strengthened our strength to the highest degree. Although we love peace and maintain neutrality, above peace and neutrality is sacred and inviolable freedom. Therefore, if it is necessary to fight to defend our independence, we will not hesitate to go into action." (Havas, 16th)

### U.S. Senate Naval Committee Discusses Expanding the Navy; Japanese Strength Will Catch Up to the U.S.; Stark Asks for New Ships to Be Built

Washington – The Senate Naval Committee discussed the U.S. Navy expansion plan today, with Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark presiding over the report. He advocated adding $45 million to the $965 million naval budget recently passed by the House of Representatives, to be allocated as follows: (1) $18 million to improve port facilities; (2) $27 million to build new ships, including four cruisers, thirteen destroyers, and eight submarines. Construction of these ships should begin within the next year. In addition, the Navy Department also submitted a memorandum to the committee, stating that Germany recently completed two battleships and has four more under construction. Italy recently completed two battleships and has two more under construction. Japan is currently building eight battleships, Britain is building nine, and France is building four (two of which have just been completed). The U.S. is also building eight. (Havas, 17th)

Stark said that if the strength of the U.S. Navy is increased by 11 percent according to the Vinson Naval Act, the ratio between the U.S. and Japan will be 5 to 4.3. If Japan continues to expand its navy at its current rate, it will be equal to the U.S. Navy in two years. He solemnly declared and requested that the Naval Committee approve an increase in naval shipbuilding to 25 percent.

### Foreign Taxpayers' Meeting: Yesterday, Amendment Passed; Japanese Demand Expansion of Economic Committee; Music Team Proposal Not Discussed

The Annual Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers of the International Settlement was held at the Race Club yesterday at 2:30 PM, with over 4,000 attendees and several hundred observers. The majority were Europeans and Americans. Notably, European and American taxpayers arrived in small groups, while the Japanese, led by Hayashi Yukichi, entered as a group. This aligned with Japanese media reports that they would firmly oppose the new budget and increased taxes, anticipating a tense meeting. The British and Americans had also been preparing for days to counter with full force. However, the Japanese only proposed expanding the membership of the Public Works Department's Economic Committee to twelve. The new budget and increased tax issues were all passed. Details are recorded below.

Well-Organized Meeting Arrangements

Authorities closely monitored this year's meeting, anticipating a large turnout. Therefore, arrangements to maintain order were meticulously planned. Above the north-facing main gate of the racecourse, a sign indicating vehicle entry was hung high. The gate near Rue Massenet was designated for taxpayer entry and exit. Above this gate, a white banner reading "Annual Meeting of Taxpayers" was stretched across the Avenue du Roi Albert to attract taxpayers' attention. At the entrance to the racecourse, four Chinese and Indian constables stood guard. Inside, around the meeting venue, over fifty Chinese, English, Japanese, and Indian police officers formed a security perimeter, standing guard with strict precautions. Dedicated personnel were stationed at the meeting entrance to check the identification documents of attending taxpayers. An information desk was set up nearby for taxpayer inquiries. The meeting was held in the racecourse grandstand. However, a temporary shed was erected in front of the grandstand as a platform for the chairman. On either side of the chairman's platform, short fences formed "For" and "Against" areas. Since counting raised hands would be difficult, these were set up for taxpayers to automatically walk into the appropriate area during voting.

Eight Items on the Meeting Agenda

The meeting agenda, proposed by Fessenden and others, consisted of eight items: (1) Elect Sir Allan Mossop, British High Court Judge in China, as Chairman of the Meeting; (2) Elect Mr. Nash as Secretary of the Meeting; (3) Adopt the valid Rules of Procedure from the previous year's meeting; (4) Elect Mr. Gillon as a member of the Land Commission; (5) Elect Mr. Carnie, Mr. Herly, Dr. Duncan, and Dr. Balson as Directors of the Public Hospital; (6) Approve the 1939 report and accounts; (7) Approve and adopt the 1940 budget expenditures proposed by the current board, together with the attached recommendations, and authorize the Public Works Department to levy and collect the proposed taxes and fees. Further, if deemed appropriate, authorize the Public Works Department to raise funds not exceeding 16 million yuan, or the equivalent in other currencies, to be used for various purposes specified in the temporary expenditure budget; (8) Adopt the already published new Rules of Procedure, which will remain in effect until the next annual meeting.

Summary of Fessenden's Speech

Fessenden, Chairman of the Public Works Department, delivered a lengthy speech. He first requested the assembly to pass the department's report and accounts. Regarding the 51% increase in the general municipal tax, he detailed the difficult economic situation and urged taxpayers to approve it. He also addressed criticisms of unfairness and provided detailed explanations. Additionally, he reported on (1) negotiations regarding road construction beyond the boundaries of the Western District, (2) recovery of police authority in the Northern District, (3) the food supply problem, (4) sheltering refugees and beggars, (5) last year's accounts, and (6) this year's budget. The last year's accounts and this year's budget were detailed in particular. The full text will be published in another section of this newspaper and will be completed in daily installments. The above is a summary.

Increased Tax Proposal Passed

Items (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (8) on the agenda were all passed smoothly. However, the situation became tense during the discussion of Item (7). Japanese taxpayer Hayashi Yukichi proposed an emergency motion to pass the budget if the Public Works Department's Economic Committee was strengthened by expanding its membership to twelve, including two Britons, two Japanese, two Americans, two Chinese, one German, one Italian, one French, and one Dutch member. The committee's authority would be to study areas of Public Works Department administration that should be revised, and the Public Works Department should express its willingness to fully accept the committee's recommendations. The assembly then passed the 1940 budget, and Fessenden announced a 50% tax increase starting next year. It was also decided to expand the membership of the Public Works Department's Economic Committee to twelve.

Music Team to Continue

Regarding the Public Works Department's music team, Mr. Quessel suggested that the Public Works Department budget could be approved, but the music team's funding should be cancelled and a subsidy of 30,000 yuan should be given by the Public Works Department. This proposal was not brought up for discussion when the budget was passed. Finally, Mr. Quessel rose and explained his reasons in detail, but the latter part of his speech was drowned out by shouts from the crowd. Opposition was voiced by Mr. Harris and Mr. Arnold. They stated that the Public Works Department's music team only consumed one-half of one percent of the entire budget, while education consumed ten percent. Similarly, a large number of residents did not directly benefit from the music team and educational facilities. Therefore, they believed that the education sector should also be cancelled. If it was not to be cancelled, then there was no reason to cancel the music team.

Authorities Expressly Forbid Gambling

During yesterday's meeting, Mr. Shalekin, a Russian lawyer, suggested that the Public Works Department could levy taxes on "slot machines" in the settlement. He claimed that if 1,000 "slot machines" were taxed at 100 yuan each month, 1,200,000 yuan could be obtained annually, which could supplement the Public Works Department's financial shortfall. In response, Fessenden stated that the Public Works Department fundamentally opposed gambling. Any business of a gambling nature would absolutely not be allowed to exist within the settlement. He also stated that the gambling issue remained serious.

Japanese Spokesperson Expresses Views

Yesterday, a Japanese embassy spokesperson stated at a press conference that if the proposal made by Hayashi Yukichi at the Foreign Taxpayers' Meeting was rejected, it would cause unpleasant results. The spokesperson stated that the Japanese proposal was to request the establishment of a "revision committee" to review the finances and administrative facilities of the Public Works Department. The Japanese believed that this request was very reasonable and up-to-date, beneficial not only to the Japanese but also to other foreign nationals. He continued that if the 51% increase in the municipal tax was passed, the current difficult problem could be temporarily resolved, but difficulties would still exist in the next accounting year. Finally, the Japanese recognized that there was no need to object to the proposed budget being passed. Therefore, to reduce difficulties, the Japanese suggested passing this budget. The Japanese still opposed the 50% tax increase, but they were well aware that the result would cause various difficulties and confusion, which would be quite inconvenient for the settlement's administration. The spokesperson concluded that the British and American foreigners were most afraid of being defeated by the Japanese yesterday.

### Lishui Attacked

### Glimpses of the Foreign Taxpayers' Meeting

— Quan

The sun squatted in the clouds, unable to exert its power, quietly shrouding the entire earth in gray, even though Avenue du Roi Albert and Rue Massenet were so lively.

A white banner reading "Annual Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers" hung across the entrance of the Race Club. The reporter passed through the police cordon and entered the meeting venue, found a seat in the press area, calmed down, and quietly read the proposed agenda. At the Dragon Gate of the racecourse and the entrance of the New World, white banners reading "Annual Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers" were also hung, fluttering in the wind. Carriages, like a long snake, were driving into the racecourse one after another. The arrangement inside the venue included a temporary wooden platform facing the grandstand. The platform was filled with various fresh flowers. Three microphones broadcast the speeches of various directors. The seats in the grandstand were covered with long boards, these were the seats for the foreign taxpayers. The wind was howling on all sides. Although it was spring, it was still strangely cold on the face. Several blue-eyed taxpayers pulled up the collars of their coats.

At exactly 2:30 PM, Chairman Fessenden first read the agenda. After the chairman and secretary were selected, the most important item was item seven. Undoubtedly, all parties paid close attention to item seven - the Public Works Department's tax increase proposal for the current year. Surrounded by Japanese newspaper reporters, Japanese taxpayer Hayashi Yukichi walked onto the stage. Mr. Hayashi Tetsuo, a translation official, also walked onto the stage behind Hayashi Yukichi, leaning on a cane with a limp. At that time, the atmosphere of the entire venue became tense. Japanese reporters were busy taking pictures, and the Japanese foreigners at the venue were applauding to signal their support. Mr. Hayashi spoke in Japanese. The reporter saw the Japanese taxpayers applauding in waves. Later, Hayashi Tetsuo translated it into English. Only then did he know that Mr. Hayashi was advocating a revision to item seven, expanding the organizational structure of the current Public Works Department's Finance Committee, increasing the number of Chinese, American, British, and Japanese committee members by two each, and French, German, Italian, and Dutch members by one each, as a condition for passing item seven. Later, McNaughten's speech and Quessel of the Far Eastern News Agency's opposition to the Public Works Department's existing music team to save money did not receive sympathy from the Westerners at the venue, who used "boos" to show their opposition. Both McNaughten and Quessel seemed to have been rebuffed and were finally rejected by the taxpayers. It seemed that the foreign taxpayers did not care about the 50% increase. After item seven was passed, the atmosphere of the entire venue relaxed a lot.

The sky deliberately made things difficult. Fine drizzle was falling non-stop. The wind god added to the turmoil and exerted its power on the taxpayers in the open air. As a result, one-third of the foreigners left the venue before the end of the meeting.

Yesterday's Japanese foreigners were sitting on the second tier of the north grandstand, in the front row of the press area. They did not seem to feel any pain or itching regarding items one to six, and they remained silent and did not express anything. The nine directors of the Public Works Department were all wearing formal attire. Chairman Fessenden's speech was loud and clear, while Sir Allan Mossop's was lower. Keswick was calm and frequently stood up to second Fessenden's proposals. The foreigners and newspaper reporters at the venue, except for the reporter, were all in Western suits. Last year, Mr. Yan and Mr. Zhu's Chinese clothing accompanied them, but this year I was the only one! A smile.

The clock pointed to 5:00 PM before embarking on the return journey. However, the "rain" and "wind" continued to wreak havoc. A tense and eye-catching annual meeting of foreign taxpayers also closed in the wind and rain.

### Summary of the Speech by the Chairman of the Public Works Department at the Foreign Taxpayers' Meeting (1)

As the Chairman of the Public Works Department, I am responsible for presenting item six, which is to pass the department's report and accounts up to December 31, 1939. Last year's achievements can be considered quite satisfactory. However, it would be incorrect to say that everything in the city is currently perfect. In the past year, the department has achieved more than one success in its facilities. Reflecting on the past and looking forward to the future, we are even more determined to exert ourselves. The department's budget for this year includes a 51% increase in the general municipal tax and various taxes and fees. This is regrettable not only for everyone but also for all departments of the Public Works Department. However, there is indeed a need to ask everyone to approve it. Currently, everyone's expenditure on various goods and necessities has almost certainly exceeded 50% compared to the past. Here is a matter for everyone to know. The Public Works Department's total recurrent expenditure budget for this year is less than half of the Shanghai Power Company's expenditure on coal alone this year. We enjoy many benefits provided by the municipal authorities on weekdays, and the taxes and fees that the municipal authorities intend to levy on us this time are only 50%, which should be considered fortunate. As for this tax increase, it is indeed necessary. Let me elaborate. Some say that Shanghai cannot be compared with Western cities. However, I have not seen Western cities spend 40% of their total municipal expenditure on police affairs. Let's take "Newcastle" in England as an example. The expenditure on police affairs there is only one-tenth of the total municipal expenditure, half of which is still subsidized by the state. Some criticize that the administrative expenses of the International Settlement are not as thrifty and economical as those of the French Concession. However, the Public Works Department pays more than three million yuan annually for prison maintenance and more than three million yuan for education expenses, which the French Concession does not bear. Some say that the department's treatment of its employees is too generous. According to the provisions of the Land Regulations, the department is responsible for hiring employees, determining salaries, and signing employment contracts. I personally believe that the treatment of the department's employees cannot be said to be too generous. Moreover, the temporary cost of living allowance should be increased again in the future. When the draft budgets for each department this year were submitted to the committees for review, the department earnestly warned that austerity should be implemented. Through the efforts of the committees and the sincere cooperation of the heads of each department, the draft budget was reduced by several million yuan. At the same time, it was considered that there was no impact on administrative efficiency. There is a certain basis for reducing administrative expenses. Beyond this, the administrative structure will be in danger of degeneration, relaxation, and unsoundness, which is not a good policy. However, in order to strive for thrift, the department has reorganized a special committee to further study ways to economize.

The department's annual report for the previous year has been printed. In addition to describing various important department affairs over the past year, it also lists the issues discussed by the various committees over the past year, as suggested by a taxpayer at the last annual meeting, detailing the regular work handled by each committee.

Negotiations in Western Shanghai

At the last annual meeting, there was a proposal to ask the Bureau to make every effort to improve the situation in the area outside the boundary of Western Shanghai because of its poor situation. At that time, because the negotiations in the area were still in progress, there was a need to keep the content of the negotiations confidential, so it was not possible to answer immediately. The Western District problem has been agreed with the Bureau to establish an agreement. The full text of the agreement must have been known to you early on, and I am convinced that the improvement of the situation in the area will see a rapid turnaround. As for the details, they are still under discussion and are expected to proceed smoothly to a satisfactory resolution. Those of you who reside in the area, your tolerance is commendable. The interests of you in the area have not been forgotten by the current directors, and the new directors should also pay close attention to them.

Police Authority in the Northern District

Regarding the issue of recovering police authority in the Northern District north of the Suzhou Creek, the Bureau has reached an agreement with the Japanese authorities, stipulating that all police authority in the district will be returned to the Bureau, and a new police district will be established. The district chief will be selected and appointed by a Japanese national and will be under the jurisdiction of the Bureau's police department. The establishment of the agreement can be said to be a concrete step in restoring the normal state of the district. At the same time, the real interests of the white-籍taxpayers in the district will be recognized in the real world.

### Guerrilla Warfare on the Shanghai-Qingpu Road; New Fourth Army Mobilizes; Fierce Battle Lasts Two Days and Nights, Japanese Army Suffers Defeat; Japanese Aircraft Fly West Yesterday, Japanese Army Has Not Withdrawn; Japanese Army Massacres Villagers, Injured Arrive in Shanghai

The Japanese and puppet troops stationed in Qibao Town, west of Shanghai, after suffering a disastrous defeat in the ambush at Huangyang Branch Bridge while attacking the guerrilla team of Gu Fuxing in Dujia Hang the day before, the Japanese side dispatched a large team of Japanese soldiers on the morning of the 14th, in 23 trucks, and allocated four tanks to assist in the battle, turning from the Great Western Road and Hongqiao Road onto the Shanghai-Qingpu Road. When they got off at Xujing Town and walked to the vicinity of Zhaoxiang, they suddenly encountered the Gu team coming. The two sides immediately engaged in a fierce battle. From morning to noon, after more than five hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese side was unable to support and began to collapse. Before leaving, they set fire along the way and burned more than 100 civilian houses. The Japanese army suffered two defeats in a row, and then mobilized the Japanese troops from Songjiang, Xinzhuang, Hongqiao, Qibao, Qingpu, Nanxiang, and Beixinjing, attempting a large-scale encirclement and attack. Fortunately, the New Fourth Army heard about it and allocated troops to assist in the battle, while the southern Japanese soldiers from Songjiang and Xinzhuang were blocked by Tian and Yao. Gu himself commanded and fought bravely, not allowing them to retreat. Those who violated the order would be beheaded, causing dense gunfire and artillery sounds all day long, clearly audible in the suburbs. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the Japanese and puppet troops suffered more than 50 casualties, and many more Chinese sacrificed themselves. Seeing that the task had been completed, the Gu Detachment Commander safely withdrew the night before. Now the Japanese side still intends to engage in battle again, so they have not withdrawn. Yesterday, nine aircraft were dispatched to fly west. Details are not yet confirmed.

Bridges on the Songqing Road Have Been Destroyed

According to people from Qingpu, Tianma Mountain, Yu Mountain, and Kunshan connected to Songjiang in the south of the county are important strongholds on the Songqing Road. The bridges on the Songqing Road were completely destroyed by our army when they withdrew to the west. After the Japanese and puppet troops stationed in Tianma and Sheshan this time, they forced civilians to repair them. The original guerrilla team stationed in the area had high morale and good discipline. They usually got along well with the people like fish and water. A few days ago, the detachment took advantage of a night with no light, secretly dispatched strong troops to attack the Japanese and puppet garrisons in Sijing, Tianma Mountain, and Sheshan, and at the same time, according to the predetermined plan, set fire to the newly repaired bridges on the Songqing Road or pried off the bridge decks and destroyed them all. When the detachment launched the attack, it was late at night. The Japanese and puppets heard the alarm in their dreams and responded hastily, not knowing what was happening. After contacting for about two or three hours, more than ten Japanese and puppet soldiers were wounded and killed. Before dawn, they withdrew safely and turned into smaller units. When the Japanese and puppets went to search the next morning, they found nothing.

Villagers Injured Come to Shanghai for Medical Treatment

The North China Daily News reports that a villager from Wumu Bridge near Hongqiao Airport suffered multiple stab wounds on his back and neck. On the night of the 16th, he was admitted to Tongren Hospital for treatment. According to the villager, on the night of the 15th, the Japanese army broke into the village and dragged out twenty villagers to question them about the activities of the guerrillas. After questioning, they stabbed the twenty people with guns. Eight of them had already died from serious injuries. Several others were seriously injured. The person concerned took a detour to Shanghai to avoid being seen by the Japanese soldiers. It was also reported that on the Shanghai-Qingpu Road, the day before yesterday (the 14th), when the Japanese army attempted to encircle the guerrillas there, the two sides engaged in a battle, and the battle was quite fierce. A Qingpu villager, Yang Jici (24 years old), was passing through Panlong when he was hit in the right waist by a stray machine gun bullet from the Japanese side, penetrating his back. His condition was very serious. At 6:30 PM yesterday, he was escorted to Shanghai and admitted to Tongren Hospital for treatment.

### Second Issue of National Defense Bonds; Payment at the End of the Month; Overseas Payments Made by the Bank of China and Bank of Communications in Hong Kong, Deducted for a Period of Three Years, Expiring After That

For the purpose of raising military supplies for the War of Resistance, the National Government issued 500 million yuan of National Defense Bonds on May 1, 1928, designating the entire income tax revenue as security for principal and interest, and ordering the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance to allocate the amount of principal and interest due in each period according to the principal and interest repayment schedule and transfer it to the central bank. The income was credited to the public bond account of the National Debt Fund Management Committee for special storage and reserve payment. A New Sound Agency reporter learned from banking circles yesterday that the first payment of principal and interest on the National Defense Bonds will be made from April 30th by the Central Bank and the banks entrusted by the Common Commission as the payment agencies. The foreign part will be paid by the original receiving bank to the China and Communications banks in Hong Kong on behalf of the payment. The above-mentioned winning bonds and expired interest coupons will be deducted for a period of three years from the date of commencement of payment. If they are not collected within the time limit, they will be invalidated and no longer paid. The interest coupons attached to the bonds drawn this time, from the third to the fifty-eighth issues, should be returned to the bank by the bondholder together with the principal when taking the principal. If there is a shortage, it will be deducted from the principal payable.

### Rescued Passengers of the Huamin Wheel Arrive in Shanghai in a Distressed State; More Than Ninety People Still Unaccounted For

The Huamin Wheel, managed by the Japanese-owned Huadong Shipping Bureau in this city, loaded passengers and cargo from Dinghai Shenjiamen on the 13th of this month. When it sailed to the Jintan waters that night, it suddenly encountered a storm and hit a reef, causing it to sink. Some of the passengers were unable to escape and drowned miserably. The rest boarded the reef and were transported to Shanghai by the Antong Wheel.

### Chinese Employees of the British Shanghai Gas Company Demand Increased Benefits; Present Demands and Await Reply; Work Stoppage Orderly

The entire workforce of over a thousand workers at the British Shanghai Gas Company's main factory at 565 Yu Qiaqing Road, due to the recent soaring prices in Shanghai, find it difficult to maintain their livelihoods with their monthly wages. Left with no choice, they requested an increase in wages and rice subsidies from the company authorities, but without success. As a result, all the workers stopped work in the morning. All the Chinese staff members, also demanding the company improve their benefits without a satisfactory response, also stopped work yesterday. According to a report by a Pingming News Agency reporter, the details are as follows:

Seven Demands

The workers of the British Shanghai Gas Company's main factory presented the company with seven formal demands yesterday morning for increased wages and rice subsidies: (1) Increase wages by 30%; (2) If the price of rice is above 20 yuan, the company should provide rice subsidies based on the highest price; if it is below 20 yuan, the company can cancel the rice subsidies; (3) The company should increase wages by 10% annually (the company originally had a 10% increase every three years, but it has been four years since the last increase); (4) Wages should be paid during holidays; (5) Workers should not be dismissed without special fault; (6) If the employer wants to lay off workers, they should pay six months of severance pay, and wage savings should also be calculated; (7) The employer should pay year-end bonuses equivalent to one month's salary. The above demands were presented to the Chief Engineer, Mr. Samuelson, by worker representatives at 3:00 PM yesterday, and all the workers are awaiting a reply in good order. It is reported that the workers at the Yangshupu branch of the company will also follow up with demands, echoing the workers at the main factory.

Workers' Hardships

According to the workers of the company, workers work more than nine hours a day in the company, and the highest wage is 1.35 yuan per day. No wages are paid on Sundays and holidays, and only half a day's wage is paid on Saturdays. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the cost of living in Shanghai has risen, and prices have soared. Workers struggle to make a living. They previously requested the company to increase rice subsidies, and the company did provide a temporary subsidy of two yuan per month. Later, as the price of rice fell slightly, the temporary subsidy was cancelled. Recently, the price of rice has soared again, and the workers are struggling to make a living. They have no choice but to ask the company to improve their benefits again, hoping that the company authorities will understand the workers' difficulties and resolve the issue satisfactorily.

Staff Demands

It is also reported that after the rice price soared, the company has already provided Chinese staff with a subsidy, equivalent to 25% of their salary. As the cost of living is currently high, the staff are finding it difficult to make ends meet. They have also made demands to the company's manager, Mr. Brown: (1) Request that the subsidy be increased to 50%; (2) When the price of rice exceeds 20 yuan, the company must subsidize one-half; (3) Request annual salary increases; (4) There should be three weeks of annual leave; (5) The company should provide an additional 10% of salary monthly for savings, with compound interest calculated every six months. At the time, Secretary Brown made no statement. Therefore, the staff (including those in the general office, Jing'an Temple, Xiafei Road, Hongkou, and the factory) also stopped work at 4:00 PM yesterday, awaiting a resolution.

### Gambling Dens in Nanshi Not Yet Opened

However, as of the 17th, this has not been realized.

Another report states that flower game gambling is prevalent in Nanshi, with public listings soliciting customers, causing severe harm. All the gambling dens in the puppet government, since being closed, have been repeatedly rumored to be reopening. As of the 16th, this has not been realized. Only the gambling table of the Dali Company at No. 11 Xima Street, Fangbang Bridge, has changed its name to Dali Canteen, advertising with red paper signs, but these were suddenly torn down yesterday. At the same time, in addition to the Carlton General Association at No. 72 Fangbangyu, which had been closed by the military police, the Nanshi "Court" also posted notices of closure yesterday, announcing the pursuit of the gambling leaders. However, the Sanxin Theater on Minguo Road was completely renovated long ago, and yesterday afternoon, the doors were suddenly opened, allowing people to visit. The bottom floor is a small theater with extremely poor lighting and air quality. The delay in opening is probably due to licensing issues.

### The Lament of the Poor: The Municipal Council Increases Public Bus Fares; Attempts to Curb Rising Prices Have No Effect

The English-language newspaper North China Daily News published a letter yesterday signed by "Seriously Affected," stating that as the Municipal Council's taxes are about to increase and life is becoming increasingly difficult, it is shameful that the Municipal Council has approved a 45% increase in public bus fares. It is recalled that a few weeks ago, your newspaper stated that the Public Bus Company did not intend to increase fares. This fare increase has severely impacted the poor. Unless fares and surcharges are reduced in the near future, the unfortunate poor may flock to the Huangpu River to end their lives. The report on the 15th stated that the Municipal Council's announcement to curb the rise in major commodities is a waste of time, and no one benefits from it. Prices have already risen so high that speculators can easily make huge profits.

### Wedding Bells Approach, Unmarried Couple Sues; Man Sues for Termination of Engagement; Woman Sues for Disrupting Family; Both Parties Insist on Investigation and Re-trial

Yu Yushan, a young Shanghai man, age 24, residing at No. 52 Yongqing Lane, Xinda Gu Road, works at the Japanese-owned Mitsui Yoko. Because his appearance resembles that of the comedic film actor Han Lan'gen, and he enjoys frequenting dance halls, the dancers all call him Han Lan'gen. In early February of this year, Yu met Xie Lianping (age 19, residing at No. 5, Tang Village, Pingjili Road, French Concession), the daughter of Xie Dougong, the former magistrate of Xi'an County, Anhui Province, at the Wuweizhai snack bar in the Great World. They fell in love and began to visit each other. On February 21st of this year, they got engaged at the New Capital Hotel and chose the 27th of this month to get married. However, Yu suddenly discovered that his fiancée, Xie Lianping,

Had Committed Theft

Of other people's diamond rings, and had been arrested by the French police. With this dishonorable fact, how could he continue to spend his life with her? He then hired lawyer Tu Kunfan to file a lawsuit in the Special Second Court against Xie Lianping to terminate the engagement, requesting mediation first. The Special Second Court mediated, but the mediation failed. Yu then formally filed a complaint. Before the trial of the termination case opened, Xie Lianping, with

Disrupting the Family

As well as a civil suit, claiming that Yu had taken her daughter away from her family through seduction. Yesterday morning, Judge Meng Tingke opened the fourth criminal court to summon them. Yu Yushan also hired lawyer Tu Kunfan to appear in court and filed a counterclaim for defamation, claiming that the plaintiff maliciously damaged the defendant's reputation in the newspapers, accusing the defendant of deceiving Jiang Jianqiu's brother, and therefore requested that she be punished according to law and that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. According to Xie Lianping's testimony, from November 13th of last year to March 3rd of this month, she had illicit relations with the defendant three times at Room 612 of the Yangtze Hotel and Room 206 of the Great Eastern Hotel, etc. Because the articles of the plaintiff's complaint required the condition of leaving parental authority, she was asked whether she went home after having relations with the defendant or going out with the defendant. She replied that she did. The court interrogated.

Yu Yushan Testified

That the reason for terminating the engagement with the plaintiff's daughter was because she had committed a dishonorable act. The plaintiff's daughter claimed that she had illicit relations three times, but this was not true. The plaintiff's complaint was entirely intended to resist my civil case. As for the request for 50,000 yuan in consolation money, I have no ability to pay it and no reason to pay it. I should ask the court to declare me innocent and dismiss the plaintiff's civil suit. Judge Meng considered that further investigation was necessary in this case and ordered a retrial at a later date.

### Finance: Collateral Loans Deadline for Redemption, Gold Market Plunges Suddenly, Down 88 Yuan Compared to Yesterday

Yesterday's cash 'cooked red' grey market situation reversed downwards, mainly due to unfavorable environmental factors, coupled with the general floating households being forced to sell off due to the three-day deadline for redemption of collateral loans. It opened down 8 yuan at 5,830 yuan. Not long after, money changers still had some interest in buying, absorbing a limited amount, and once rose to 5,845 yuan. However, soon after, the foreign exchange market became loose, and news of the victory in the Nanchang battle, as well as the aforementioned reasons, sparked a large number of sellers, with securities firms and Yu Heng taking the largest volume, and banks also selling. The price then dropped to 5,775 yuan. Although there was a slight pull in the middle, by noon, securities firms continued to sell heavily, and the selling pressure remained strong, falling again to 5,748 yuan. The situation stabilized slightly at noon, and the market closed at 5,750 yuan, down 88 yuan compared to yesterday. There was no market in the afternoon session, and the market outside the venue turned slightly, with the final price being around 5,760 yuan. The transaction volume for half a day was over 2,500 taels. Gold jewelry in gold shops fell by 10 yuan, and customs gold remained flat.

'Cooked Red' Reverses Downward

From the morning 'mother bar' (ten taels), the opening market situation was still flat. The opening price was slightly suppressed by 8 yuan. A securities firm sold to a bank for 5,830 yuan. Later, a money changer suddenly came to search and buy, and raised the price by 15 yuan. The money changer bought ten taels from the securities firm for 5,845 yuan. After that, because the US exchange rate slightly loosened, and there was talk of HSBC and other outside firms urging redemption of collateral loans, the selling pressure suddenly increased. Securities firms were particularly strong in dumping, and gold shops and banks also sold, dropping by 70 yuan. The securities firm sold 30 taels to the money changer for 5,775 yuan. At that time, another money changer saw the low price and slightly absorbed, recovering 15 yuan. The money changer bought 20 taels from the gold shop for 5,790 yuan. However, not long after, a securities firm came to dump again, plus the banks selling again, falling another 42 yuan. The gold shop sold 40 taels to the money changer for a low price of 5,748 yuan. Then the gold shops traded among themselves for 30 taels for 5,750 yuan, making the noon closing price. As a result, it fell back 88 yuan compared to the previous day, with a range of 97 yuan in half a day. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand of gold was several yuan higher than 'cooked red', and the purchase price was 20 yuan lower. The current bid gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little activity. For gold jewelry sold in gold shops, Da Tong Hang still hung at 590 yuan at the beginning, until 7:15, when it was listed 5 yuan lower, and at 12:00 noon, it was 5 yuan lower. There were no changes after that. As a result, Da Tong Hang changed to 580 yuan, which was the same as the upper price, and the purchase price was about 15 yuan lower.

### Foreign Exchange Turns Stable

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation saw HSBC's listed prices remain unchanged. The grey market for British and American exchange rates turned loose. The public generally held bullish sentiment towards exchange rates, so there were many who sold off profits throughout the day. The morning opened with China Bank forcefully selling, and there was a lack of buyers at one point, so the market appeared hardened, and the $6 US exchange rate could be settled at that time. Not long after, Sassoon suddenly became interested in buying, and foreign telegrams from Mumbai suddenly came to purchase forward British gold, but outside firms provided good supply, and the market situation remained stable. Subsequently, China Bank continued to sell, while American banks absorbed, and the situation did not change. Later, speculators entered the market to buy some, and trading gradually became sparse. Until noon, it slightly softened, and as a result, British gold closed at 4/125, and the US exchange rate was 5.96875, which was still flat compared to the British gold of the previous day, and the US exchange rate loosened by 0.03125. The futures all reported a slight hardening, and the potential trend was the same as the spot market.

Sassoon Still Settles Purchases

In the early morning, the London big bar was up 125 recently, and 0625 in the far distance. The New York silver price was still flat, the London raw gold was stable, and the exchange rates for British gold against Shanghai, France, and other currencies were all flat. The US dollar fell 75 against the British pound, fell 5 cents against Shanghai, and fell 25 against the French franc. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was British gold 4/125, and the US dollar was 5.9375, which was the same as the evening closing of the previous day for both British and American exchange rates. After the opening, China Bank dumped heavily at first, and the market became loose. The spot US dollar was the cheapest, once reaching $6. China Bank sold the May US dollar to foreign banks for 5.6875 to 71875, and the April US dollar for 5.9375. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The balance tax on silver was announced at half a yuan. After that, Sassoon and a foreign telegram from Mumbai suddenly came to buy forward British gold. Because it was beneficial, the British gold still reported stability. It was estimated that May British gold was traded at 3/890625. Subsequently, China Bank continued to sell, and the public was bullish on exchange rates, so although there were American and other absorptions, buying and selling still felt balanced. It was estimated that China Bank sold the April US dollar to foreign banks for 5.9375 and 90625, and China Bank sold the May US dollar to American banks for 5.6875. Until noon, speculators slightly absorbed, so there was a slight recovery. As a result, the closing price was British gold at 4/125, the US dollar at 5.96875, April British gold at 4/03125, the US dollar at 5.875, and May British gold at 3/875, the US dollar at 5.65625. Compared with the British gold of the previous day, except for the current month, it was slightly tight at 015625. The spot and May were both flat, and the US dollar's futures and spot were equally hard at 03125. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Hong Kong Market Did Not Rise

Hong Kong 17th (Wednesday) telegram, this morning the exchange market opened flat, with no changes in British, American, and Japanese exchange rates. The Shanghai exchange spot rate fell by one yuan, to 360 yuan and 75 cents. It was reported flat at 11:30, with no changes in exchange rates. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.

Tianjin British and American Tighted

Tianjin 17th (Wednesday) telegram, this morning the exchange market opened flat. The British exchange spot rate was tightened by 0625, to 3 pence and 84375.

The 'Lianchao' grey market was cheaper by 07 corners and 5 points, to 102 yuan and 7 corners and 5 points.

### Foreign Currencies Have Begun To Recover

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation suddenly weakened, due to the widespread rumors of the recovery of Nanchang, gold prices plummeted, and British and American gold also fell sharply. The US dollar bill market trended downward, retreating to 16 yuan, 5 corners, and 6 points in the evening, a decline of 1 corner and 2 points compared to the previous day. The British gold bill, on the other hand, was slightly higher due to the tight forward British exchange rate in the black market, so the demand was not weak, and the market price rose slightly. Hong Kong bills softened slightly along with the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. Japanese gold bills and Korean bills were supplied continuously, and market prices continued to decline. The former retreated to 1 yuan, 3 corners, 1 point, and 2 mils, and the latter fell to 1 yuan, 0 points, and 4 mils and 5 hairs. Everything else remained unchanged.

### Discount and Interbank Lending Both Show Small Recoveries

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange-drawn notes showed a slight decline, with the rate per thousand yuan gradually decreasing from 76 yuan and 5 corners in the morning to 75 yuan, and further decreasing to 75 yuan in the afternoon, a decrease of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. The interest rate of the Qianye Guild has also been listed as one point lower, with both the morning and afternoon markets listed as 2 corners.

### Food: Rice Prices Fluctuate Greatly

Recently, the magnitude of the changes in rice prices has been constantly beyond expectations. Tracing back to the previous Guan rise, the highest peak of No. 1 Saigon once reached 47 yuan and a half, and then suddenly fell to around 40 yuan. This time, due to the soaring gold prices, it suddenly rose again within a week, advancing day by day, restoring the previous high peak, rising by as much as 7 or 8 yuan, which is truly an unprecedented change in the rice market. There were even more changes yesterday. It initially fell and then rose, and then fell and rose again. In the morning, both buyers and sellers were briefly softened, and because of the high prices, the origin prices were close, and the thinking was slightly inferior. There was no inquiry from the guest no shop customers, but floating traders and retail households had their usual thinking and acted accordingly, selling and buying to adapt to the situation, and it was particularly active. For example, No. 1 Saigon only opened at 47 yuan, and small grain at 42 yuan and 6 corners, a decrease of half a yuan to nearly one yuan compared to the previous session. After this guest sold and then took action, one action led to a hundred actions, and it became lively, and the market rose accordingly, and then returned to the original session. Subsequently, buying and selling were quite strong, and those who made profits returned to sell, and those who padded empty bought in, each according to their own thinking. The overall market situation in the mid-market formed a balance between supply and demand, and after a long delay, the market atmosphere gradually weakened and the sales market slackened, turning soft again. The price of each commodity fell again. Just when the small grain fell to 43 yuan at the close, a general thinker took advantage of the cheapness to suddenly advance, and the market suddenly increased by half a yuan. No. 1 Saigon was still 47 yuan and a half, and small grain was 43 yuan and a half.

The thick and thin japonica rice in the off-site market was the same, lacking prosperity or disgrace. Changbang japonica still opened at 46 or 7 yuan, medium 44 or 5 yuan, Qingsi extra thin 46 yuan, Gao City 45 yuan and a half, 45 yuan, Nangang early and late rice 43 or 4 yuan. Only glutinous rice was far away from other goods in terms of selling price, the lowest, and many large households hoarded it, so the current market was not affected by foreign rice and continued to rise by more than half a yuan. Kai Luan Yang special yuan 40 yuan, Changdan Baiyuan special since 39 yuan, 6 or 7 corners, decided to 37 yuan and a half. According to statistics, the arrival of japonica and glutinous rice was imported into the boundary by Hongkou Dachang Company, with another two or three thousand packages.

Foreign rice initially strengthened and then fell, and the market situation gradually tended to recover. When the market opened in the early morning, the market rumored that a Chinese businessman's 2,700 tons of No. 1 or 2 Saigon were loaded on the Norwegian and Danish rounds to Shanghai and were blocked in Hong Kong halfway, so the atmosphere suddenly became tense and people were optimistic. Although there were large households secretly dumping, the current foreign rice was hoarded and raised by the local guest lines to 5, 6, or 7 corners. Then it was rumored that Nanchang had been recovered, and those who profited took the opportunity to sell at a high price, and the market immediately trended downward, with prices falling by 3, 5, or 6 corners. The selling momentum was even stronger in the afternoon, and prices continued to be reduced by half a yuan. The early market for No. 1 Saigon was 48 yuan, and it had fallen to 47 yuan in the afternoon. The early market for No. 1 road goods was 55 yuan and 7 corners, and it was still difficult to sell at 55 yuan in the afternoon. The early market for No. 2 April or May was 54 yuan and a half, and it fell to 53 yuan and a half in the afternoon. That is, Siamese had opened at 53 yuan and 2 corners. A total of 525 tons of foreign rice was opened throughout the day, and there were 8 or 9,000 packages of spot goods.

Wuxi rice and paddy are flowing from various sources in recent days, and market prices are expected to be flat and loose. However, unexpectedly, the Shanghai rise continues. A Japanese business group company entrusted the Wuxi rice industry to purchase a large amount of rice and paddy to be shipped out, and daily received hundreds of thousands of shi of japonica paddy and two or three thousand shi of white rice. On the 15th and 16th, the purchasing power was still strong. Coarse japonica was 16 yuan, 3 or 4 corners per shi, and japonica paddy was 13 yuan, 2 corners, and 5 points per shi. White japonica was at 28 yuan. Hoarders purchased one after another. Although the arrival was rushing, the market had rises and no falls, and the rice price rose by more than one yuan compared to a week ago. Japonica paddy rose by 5 or 6 corners per person.

### Flour Market Stable

The flour market situation was peaceful, and the No. 2 flour factory's price was still 13 yuan and 5 corners. Returned goods with old truck brands were also equal to the factory's price. Transactions on this street gradually turned to wait-and-see. Guest sales lacked impetus due to the high prices of guest discs. It was heard that a small number of foreign gun station flour was handled by the northern gang, with the price being 13 yuan, 7 or 8 corners.

Yesterday's wheat transaction gradually became active. It was heard that Chinese factories still needed to match local wheat because foreign wheat was loaded. The supplier was unable to struggle. It was estimated that more than 5,000 packages of Changxi and other wheat were opened, with the price being 21 yuan to 20 yuan and 8 and a half corners, about half a yuan lower than the previous session. It was heard that Suzhou Gaodu wheat still required 21 yuan and 5 corners, and the incoming households hated the opening.

Wuxi flour, powder, and transport to Shanghai have been shelved for a long time and cannot be moved into the concession. In addition, there is sufficient flour in Wuxi, and the market situation has been trending downstream, falling to about 11 yuan per package. In the past few days, large households have inquired about it, and this month's flour has rebounded by 3 or 4 corners. The market opened at 11 yuan, 3 corners, 7 or 8 points on the 15th, and the May period flour opened at 11 yuan and 5 corners in the early market.

### Metals: Metals Rise, Unstoppable

Yesterday's metals market was affected by many factors, and the market trend was turbulent and very powerful. The hoarding trend was revived, and the prices of various commodities soared. The market disk changed several times a day. For example, the price of black iron ingots was still 880 yuan in the previous market, and yesterday's market required 900 yuan. The price increased by 20 yuan in one day, which was rare in the past one or two months. Each box of 200 pounds also required 85 or 6 yuan, and general hoarders and speculators scrambled to purchase endlessly, while the actual transactions of various manufacturers and merchants felt as few as morning stars. Other foreign nails opened at 60 yuan, and new lead wire also broke the 100 yuan mark. The price of company iron was about 170 yuan per box, and the price of tinplate was 220 yuan. Single chain also opened at 120 yuan, and American bar iron also hovered around 120 yuan. The asking price for 26-gauge large tinplate was even more amazing, requiring more than 500 yuan per box, which was never seen before.

### Piece Goods: Dragon Head Fine Cloth Falls Significantly, All Coarse and Fine Piece Goods Fall, Fellow Traders and New Hoarders Buy In

National Cloth

Yesterday, the cloth market saw retail hoarders scramble to sell off, and the actual demand was limited. Fellow traders and new households bought in at reduced prices, so the selling price plummeted. The lowest price of Fugui fine cloth reached 42 yuan, and the lowest price of Fugui fine twill was 36 yuan and 7 and a half corners, a decrease of about 5 yuan per piece compared to yesterday's market. Coarse cloth fell by 2 and a half corners to one yuan per piece. Yihe goods were more stable. The transaction volume on this street was suddenly light. Wholesale shops handled more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth twill, and fellow traders traded more than 200 pieces of various goods. The colored cloth industry temporarily suspended the purchase of grey cloth. Cantonese gangs handled more than 200 pieces of colored cloth bleached cloth poplin, and Wen Yong gangs from Zhejiang Road handled more than 300 pieces of twill colored cloth coarse cloth. Today (18th) there are 785 pieces of piece goods to be shipped to Hong Kong.

Piece Goods - East

Rising and falling alternately, the falling wind is always strong. The price of white goods Longtou fine cloth opened at 44 yuan per piece in the morning. Not long after, due to the sharp drop in yarn prices, the asking price was chaotic, and it plummeted to 40 yuan and 05 corners. The shepherd's disk at noon was 41 yuan. The back market stepped down again from the 39 yuan market, and the lowest price was sold at 37 yuan and 5 corners. Immediately after, the falling trend was too severe, and the rebound was also fast, and the closing price was 40 yuan. The market only traded white goods fine cloth throughout the day, and fine twill seemed unheard of, and only the sound of Longtou was heard in fine cloth. The middle-end brands were also rarely traded. This is enough to show that the soaring and falling in the past two days was manipulated by non-industry speculators, disrupting the market.

### Yarn and Cotton: Cloth Falls Miserably, Yarn Price Drops Straight Down, Shuangma Falls 75 Yuan At Once

The yarn market continued to fall, and the falling wind was also strong. The one-rise and one-fall in recent times is truly alarming. The soaring in the past and the miserable fall today are all too violent when compared. However, the current yarn sales can still support it, but there must be a big drop if there is such a surge.

The spot yarn market opened in the morning, and the market was still in good spirits. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma was 1,430 yuan, and the factory list spot was 1,440 yuan. As soon as this price opened, there were few buyers in the market, the food households were not prosperous, and it showed a tired image. It fell to 1,400 yuan for the factory list. The Guangbang purchased spot goods at a price of 1,430 yuan. There was a slight spin in the middle. It was heard that the cloth market was sluggish, and it fell again. The factory list fell to below 1,400 yuan, and it plummeted to 1,330 yuan. The spot was 1,345 yuan. It was found that the transaction volume for half a day was 2,370 packages, and the spot price of the 20-count Shuangma market fell by 75 yuan. Today, there are 5,430 pieces to be shipped to Hong Kong. The number of pieces purchased by each gang is as follows:

Indian Cotton Sources May Be Hit - Pingguoer Jumps 5 or 6 Yuan

There were fewer local cotton transactions than before, but the people's sentiments were particularly good, so market prices rose daily. The price of Pingguoer rose by another 5 or 6 yuan compared to the previous day. This is because the European war has a pattern of expansion, and the sources of future ships may be hit, so the price of cotton is advancing daily. Those who are Luo are quite enthusiastic about the spot goods. The transaction situation of the current cotton is listed below.

Another news about the foreign cotton market price: the New York cotton market was quite firm and active yesterday. At the same time, it is widely rumored that the government will raise the loan prices for new flowers, so buyers are very prosperous. The back market rose again, and a part of the short covering resulted in a closing price higher than the recent period of the previous day by 5 or 6 pounds and 10 cents, and the long-term rose by more than 10 pounds and 10 cents. India stopped trading yesterday, and it is predicted that it will rise by one rupee. Egypt fell by more than 20 pounds and 10 cents yesterday.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions Continued To Be Very Active Yesterday, And The Price Of Cotton Did Not Loosen Due To The Decline In Yarn Prices. The Trade's Appetite For Spot Goods Has Always Been Strong. Because Indian Cotton And Transporting Ships To Shanghai Are Difficult, All Parties Are Active In Brazilian Cotton, But All Are For Ships Loaded In June And July. Although The Selling Price Is More Expensive Than Jiao Indian Cotton, It Is Much Cheaper Than American Cotton. The Following Is Yesterday's Cotton Market Price Calculated At The Exchange Rate Of US$5.9375.

### Securities: Selling Pressure On Foreign Stocks Turns Strong

The grey market for securities tended to be stronger yesterday. Initially, it was stabilized by the decline in gold prices, and then it tended to rise due to the saying that Nanchang was recovered. Although there were many buyers in the market, the sellers were also very enthusiastic. Only because the silver roots were tight, the purchase was obviously restricted, which was not easy to arouse the real reason for many people's interest. It is now heard that a certain party is trying its best to disrupt Yu Rong and actively carrying out it. All parties are talking about tigers, and everyone is frightened. This kind of hidden influence has a great influence on the hearts of ordinary people, so the future of the debt market is still full of thorns. Yesterday, Tongkang and Lianhe were the most consistent in buying in, and continued to buy in throughout the morning and afternoon. The rest of Hengkang, Dingkang, Lianyi, Lemao, and Dadu also bought in more and sold less. The sellers were Runli and Zhongxin, and the rest of Yongkang, Tiansheng, Yongxiang, and Hengfu mostly sold more and bought less. As a result, it recovered well by 6 corners to 3 and a half corners. The total number of transactions was about 900,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading, 40 shares of Tianchu MSG were traded, the price per share was 89.

The public stock market saw the weekend roll-over by expectation first to sell, and the prices of various stocks returned slightly lower under the pressure of the seller, and the transaction was rare due to the lack of buyers. Jardine Matheson opened, buying at 183 yuan and selling at 84 yuan, with a transaction at both prices. Later, because the buyer was satisfied, the price fell slightly, hovering around 180 yuan for a long time. British joint shares are relatively quiet, opening at 47 yuan, falling to 45 yuan and 75, and closing at 46 yuan with buyers. Jardine Matheson opened, and the auction price fell from 63 yuan to 62 yuan. Due to the relationship of short replenishment, it was pushed to 65 yuan. After that, the selling wind was strong and once lowered to 60 yuan. The closing was firm to 61 yuan. Rubber shares were bleak, and although the price of raw rubber was firm and high, it could not have any influence, because the trend of industrial shares was relatively soft.

The London Securities Market Was Unchanged, And The Industry Guang Company Was Said To Have A Dividend

The British Industry Guang Production Company specializes in land sales and purchases with a capital of 12 million taels and invests in more than 100 real estate properties. The profit in 1939 was more than 1.23 million yuan, and the accumulated amount from the previous year was more than 490,000 yuan, totaling 700,000 yuan. In addition to the special repair reserve of more than 220,000 yuan, the balance has recently been heard that a board meeting will be held within days, and there is a saying to pay dividends.

### Coal: White Coal Rises For Four Consecutive Sessions, And Another 10 Yuan Yesterday

After this default expanded, the price of white coal has already risen for three consecutive sessions. Yesterday, the market was full of rumors that the Norwegian ship was detained, and the freight owner took the opportunity to pick up another 10 yuan. The Dalongxing company, which manages Hongji white coal, has more than 10,000 stones of spot goods in stock, and is still reluctant to sell them, which makes the hearts of the people more and more turbulent. It is estimated that Haifeng white coal is used in the industry line demolition at 190 yuan per ton, and Hongji white coal is 180 yuan per ton. There is a line but no market, and there is no opening for the time being. The white coal shavings for the coal ball raw materials continued to increase by 7 yuan, 115 yuan, and there is no supply yet.

### Coal Sources Uninterrupted, Coal Merchants Seize the Opportunity to Hoard

Recently, seeing the expansion of European affairs, coal merchants in this city have taken the opportunity to raise coal prices, assuming that the supply will be affected. In fact, although Norwegian ships have ceased operations, British and Maersk ships are still sailing as usual, and the supply is not lacking. On the afternoon of the 16th, around 6 PM, two ships arrived in port. They were loaded with large quantities of coal from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai. The Jeannette Shinner, a British ship, carried 3,700 tons and berthed at buoys 11 and 12 for unloading. The Jomislan, another British ship agented, carried 8,083 tons and berthed at Qichang Wharf in Pudong for unloading. It can be seen that the increase in coal prices is entirely manipulated by coal merchants. ( )

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans Stabilize, Coarse Grains Shipped to Hong Kong

Yesterday, the soybean market situation followed the rising trend of the previous day. Soybeans continued to maintain a price of one yuan, and the trend in the oil market slightly increased. The overall environment loosened, causing operators to hesitate, resulting in a decrease in transactions. However, the market closed with support and did not fall, so people still had bullish sentiment. Yesterday, the unified market only saw the opening of a Nanjing bean car, which was purchased by an oil pressing factory (price details in the market column). Furthermore, local merchants purchased 400 bags of Anqing beans, 600 bags of Wuhu beans, 100 bags of Yangzhou Jue beans, over 100 bags of Qingdao beans, and 200 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans.

Today, 4,218 bags of soybeans, 1,240 pieces of soybean cakes, 500 bags of raw peanuts, 270 cases and 1,040 cans of raw oil, 40 bags of sesame, and 620 cans of sesame oil are being shipped to Hong Kong.

### Miscellaneous Items: American Salt Suddenly Arrives in Shanghai

It is heard that an American mail ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday, bringing 700-800 barrels of salt from New York. This salt was procured by the British firm Jardine Matheson from America. It is indeed rare to see American salt in China.

(From this newspaper of the 12th year of Tongzhi in the late Qing Dynasty)

Called Another Man Father

Guang Mao Ju is a wine shop located next to the stone gate outside the east gate of Tianjin. Its Wujiapi wine is famous far and wide. Its sales are especially brisk when steamships arrive at the port and sand boats gather. There are dozens of wine vats inside the shop, with bottles and jars stacked high. A certain person from Yangzhuangzi, a village attached to the city, worked at the shop and had a son and a daughter. The son died of smallpox at the age of five, and his body was left in a reed marsh. This happened twenty years ago. One day, a young man in fancy clothes, with a high carriage drawn by four horses, speaking with a southern accent, visited the village. Most of the villagers were peasants, and they suspected there was a mistake when such a distinguished person arrived. But when he spoke the name and address of a certain person, he was exactly right. At that time, the person was working as a fishmonger, had accumulated some savings, and was at the wine shop, but had not yet met the young man. The village elders asked the young man's name, and he said that he was the child who had died of smallpox. The smallpox was caused by congenital heat toxins, and being abandoned in the reed marsh, he absorbed the clear air from the reeds, which dissipated the heat and toxins, allowing him to be reborn. He was picked up by a fishmonger and sold to the Hai Fang Fen Fu Shu (Maritime Defense Sub-Prefecture) in Wei, and the sub-prefect had no son, so he adopted him. Later, he retired and died. Now I have paid taxes and obtained an official position, and I am eager to repay my parents. If I have time, I will visit my father's grave and welcome him to live in the south as an honored elder. The person had a younger brother, who was a laborer living in a nearby village. The young man dressed in official attire visited him, and the uncle saw that his nephew was handsome and had become a high-ranking official, and was extremely envious. He insisted on the young man staying overnight. The person's daughter, because her uncle had traveled far, also returned home to meet him, and told of his journey and whereabouts, and they cried together. The uncle and brother-in-law then urged the father and daughter to reunite. The person did not want to acknowledge the young man, but could not avoid it, so they returned to the village together. Initially, when the person's son lived in his uncle's house, he ate fine meat and wore silk. His traveling bags were brought by his attendants, and the uncle provided his food. After returning home, his meals were the same as before, but the person thought that it could only be temporary and not permanent, so following the local custom, he was given millet. The young man could not swallow it, and said that the poverty in the north was unbearable, and he wanted to welcome the person to return to the south with him.

Thoughts

### The Spirit of Loving Truth

— Yang Xiangfang

"I love my teacher, but I love truth even more." This is the famous saying of the great Greek philosopher Aristotle, who lived more than 300 years before the Common Era. Even now, whenever this sentence is mentioned, everyone feels the greatness of Aristotle's spirit of loving truth. Aristotle's philosophical achievements benefited greatly from his teachers and friends, but he felt that what should be maintained even more was the truth of the universe. From this, we can know how humbly he studied and did not hold preconceived notions.

Humility means objectively observing facts and removing prejudices that obscure one's personal feelings. Any fact, any speculation, is only related to the research question. Regardless of whether it conflicts with personal opinions, as long as the evidence is sufficient, it is always accepted with an open mind. If one can do this, the results of the research will be unbiased, accurate, and reliable.

The English philosopher Huxley (T.H. Huxley) once said: "I neither deny nor affirm the immortality of the soul. I cannot produce any reason to believe in it, but I also have no way to deny it... I always need evidence when I believe in something; if it gives me the same evidence, I can also believe in the immortality of the soul." Whether the soul is immortal or not is another question, but Huxley's attitude of breaking preconceived notions is worthy of our respect.

Human thoughts mostly come from experience, and each person's heart is often mixed with emotions such as preferences, dislikes, and hopes. Therefore, when in contact with external things, their recognition and discernment often have errors, but because they are obscured and restrained by personal feelings, or because of the arrogance of reason, they stubbornly hold onto their own opinions without realizing it. Moreover, due to differences in education, habits, occupations, and other physiological and psychological factors, they develop certain quirks and are unwilling to study with an open mind.

With the progress of science and the continuous discovery of new research, so-called truths may have the possibility of change and correction, but in the relationships of all things, there are always facts that possess objective value and are generally recognized by people. We should maintain and pursue these relatively close-to-fact truths with a passionate attitude.

Therefore, we can affirm that truth is the guide of our thought activities and the norm of our daily lives. A person full of the vitality of life must constantly cherish the desire to pursue truth.

If we want to cultivate correct thoughts and reasonable life norms, we must break preconceived notions and avoid blind obedience. For any matter, we must carefully consider and judge it with a strict and objective attitude. Holding the spirit of "examining oneself," respecting the facts before us, being humble, removing preferences, and experiencing the famous saying of that medieval philosopher.

Sports

### Adult Physical Education

— Bao Shixi

Adult physical education should be universally promoted.

"Physical education" in China seems to be the entertainment of a special class—a small number of students and athletes. Most people, especially working adults, have no opportunity to be involved with it. Therefore, most Chinese people are still "sick men of East Asia."

There are no public sports venues on the isolated island for the public to exercise their bodies. This not only affects individual health but also indirectly affects the future of the entire nation's physique.

On the eve of physical education shining on the whole people, we do not have to expect large-scale group sports venues in the country, like the Soviet Union and other advanced European and American countries, for the whole people to exercise their bodies. However, we should take the simplest exercise methods today to strengthen our physique. Extending it to others and universally promoting it.

Since working adults do not have the opportunity to go to sports venues and gyms of schools or sports organizations to exercise, I think the following simple exercise methods can be adopted:

(1) Deep breathing—Performing deep breathing exercises in the sunshine and in places with fresh air every morning can develop the lungs and prevent the occurrence of pulmonary tuberculosis. At the same time, it promotes the health of the body and mind.

(2) Eight Brocades—Is a kind of soft calisthenics. Practicing this exercise every morning or before going to bed allows the bones and muscles of the whole body to move and blood circulation to flow. The physique will definitely become stronger day by day.

(3) Walking—Adults with weak bodies can use walking to exercise their bodies. If one can do more long-distance walking, it can not only strengthen the body but also save transportation costs.

In addition, activities such as rope skipping, jogging, ice skating, visiting parks, and hiking to explore famous scenic spots are all simple ways to exercise. If one can persevere and exercise without interruption every day, one can definitely maintain the health of one's body and mind and increase the pleasure of body and mind.

Universally promoting adult physical education so that everyone has a healthy physique is not only the happiness of individuals and families but also the happiness of the future of the entire nation.

Science

### Monkey Assistants

— Xu Mengbiao

In the Singapore Botanic Gardens, there are two monkeys, one named Jinbao and the other named Beide. These two small animals have made considerable contributions to science. The director of the garden, Conner, praised them, saying: "These two monkeys are my very smart assistants."

On tall tropical trees, there are often flowers that are of great value in botany. If people are asked to climb up to collect them, it is not only very difficult but also very dangerous. These two monkeys have been specially trained and can climb to the top of the tree in a few minutes and collect these botanical specimens.

However, monkeys have a bad temper: when they are hungry, they often eat the collected flowers. But as long as they are given some food such as bananas in advance, the same thing will not happen again.

### Jesus' Concept of Gratitude (2)

Jesus' gratitude to God for the suffering he was about to endure is completely different from the gratitude of people for material success. Remember that there were ten lepers who came to Jesus for healing. After Jesus healed them, only one of the ten thought it should not be forgotten and returned to thank Jesus. We take many privileges and benefits for granted, with absolutely no sense of reverence; this is our great mistake as human beings. True gratitude is a kind of spiritual power, earned through hard work. This spiritual power can give people moral courage and elevate their minds. A grateful heart can also be said to be a kind of profound thought; those who are thoughtless are mostly ungrateful. We cannot have a sense of gratitude to God out of thin air; we must struggle hard on the battlefield of life and only after achieving victory will we feel grateful. The only way to truly understand the spirit of gratitude is to fight adversity, deal with our own special problems, and give ourselves a reason to be grateful. Two young men wanted to find jobs, but they didn't dare to ask themselves, so they asked their mother to intercede with Jesus on their behalf. Seeing that they had no idea what they were asking for, Jesus frankly asked them, "Can you drink the cup I drink? Can you be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?" In other words, can you endure all the hardships and difficulties that I have endured on the battlefield of life? After suffering pain and disappointment, can you still thank God for it? When everything seems to be against you, what assurance do you have as a person? Jesus is asking us the same questions today. Can we be grateful for adversity and for the lessons learned from adversity? (To be continued)

For detailed study, please send a letter to P.O. Box 1227.

### Plagiarism Rescue

Mr. Han, editor of "Free Talk":

Actually, we cannot blame you for the negligence in editing contributions, precisely because a person's energy is limited and cannot read all the medical books in the world. Moreover, no one in the world can completely remember all the articles they have read.

Didn't you tell the contributors long ago not to steal other people's articles and pretend they are their own works? But in the "Free Talk" of the sixth of this month, I discovered a plagiarist—Shao Xiongfei—who moved a piece of "The Sovereignty of Occupation" (written by Lu Fei Kui of Tongxiang, published by Zhonghua Publishing) to "Free Talk" to deceive readers, passing it off as his own work.

Although his "Disaster Relief through Remuneration" at the end of the article is a kind act of charity, this kind of behavior is as ridiculous as a thief stealing someone else's things as a gift to give away. If, at the moment of giving or receiving this gift, someone points out that it is not a gift but stolen goods, then the giver's face will be flushed with shame, and the recipient will surely feel uncomfortable. This kind of behavior that harms others and does not benefit oneself, even if it is well-intentioned, is not glorious.

I think the victims of the disaster also understand etiquette deeply, and they will definitely not accept Mr. Shao Xiongfei's "righteous act." On the contrary, they should give him a lesson so that he will not insult you again in the future.

Practicing writing articles is originally a good thing. "Disaster relief," in this era of great changes, is a duty that everyone should fulfill, in addition to the victims of the disaster themselves. However, stealing other people's articles and then "disaster relief through remuneration" is a loss greater than the gain to one's personality. I feel sorry for Shao Jun and hope that he will value himself more in the future.

Sir, do you think I am right? Please accept my best wishes.

From reader Zhu Yunting.

Random Thoughts

### Personality On Sale

— Li Yongyun

Respectfully dedicated to plagiarists

Open your eyes and take a look at Shanghai society. The first impression that comes to mind is speculation and opportunism. Once this trend starts, people who shake their pens also plan to find shortcuts to success. But becoming successful by copying books is just a rumor. As for the reality—let's also copy a trendy sentence: "It has never happened."

"Speculating" is the game, "opportunism" is the goal, and the original intention of plagiarism is naturally to fish in troubled waters. But this is exactly what is called being too clever by half. In broad daylight, under the watchful eyes of the public, to think that one will not be exposed is truly "difficult, oh heaven."

Hiding one's name, so no one knows, even if things fail, it seems that there is "nothing to be ashamed of." However, in this year of rising prices for everything, why bother with a sale of one's personality? Shouldn't plagiarists "think thrice" about it? Remember, Buddha said: turn around and the shore is at hand. Then, I, you, he—in the order of readers, "authors," and editors, it is not old-fashioned to say—we are all fortunate.

As the times progress, strange things happen in the world. Now that we have reached a point of "fervor," we even have plagiarism for disaster relief. It seems that they deeply understand the meaning of "even thieves have principles," but I don't intend to say "it is excusable," but rather ask the question: "What is the intention?" At best, one can only say "unfathomable," "unfathomable." I also have to "hold back."

### "Philanthropic Plagiarist"

— Editor

Regarding this heartbreaking unfortunate incident, after the exposure by Mr. Zhu Yunting and the "Dedication" by Mr. Li Yongyun, the personality of the "philanthropic plagiarist" Shao Xiongfei, who is fit to be with the trash, has been nakedly exposed before hundreds of thousands of readers. There is no need for the editor to say anything more.

I only want to declare here that the remuneration for the article plagiarized by the "philanthropist" should be cancelled in order to express our deep disgust for such incidents, to express our non-cooperation with the "plagiaristic philanthropist," and to let him know that becoming a "philanthropist" has not been achieved, but the loss of one's personality is a thing that is a loss greater than the gain.

We thank our friend Mr. Zhu Yunting of "Free Talk"!

Essays

### Also on Friendship

— Shi Zhang

After reading Mr. Liu Daohong's "Great Friendship" on March 28th, I seemed to feel an indescribable sense of lightness and joy in my heart, because before that, I had never thought that there were people in the world who sympathized with me and had the same feelings as me. I always thought that my need for friendship, my need for comfort, my need for encouragement, my need for help, was my hysteria, my personal extravagant hope, and not a universal human desire. Therefore, it has become a big secret that I have been hiding for eighteen years.

When a person comes into the world, many difficulties, sorrows, and despairs arise invisibly in his fate and encounters. Therefore, everyone needs various kinds of spiritual comfort and nourishment. Once he cannot get it, he gradually becomes cold, indifferent, and even resentful towards the world. People are originally deformed, and people's hearts are originally contradictory. When you hope to gain the friendship of others, why are you unwilling to first give your own friendship to others? Why not give a little comfort to others and gain even greater comfort from others? People need "great friendship," but why is it lacking in the world? This is always my question.

Know that when someone gives you friendship or also hopes to accept your friendship at the same time, this is your happiness, your right, you should treasure it, accept it. Because a person who destroys his own happiness and rejects the rights he should enjoy is foolish—if you are sure that it is true happiness, true rights. At the same time, it also gives rise to the obligation to increase the happiness and rights of others.

Everyone hopes to have a fulfilling and noble life, but whether or not they can get it depends on the price each person is willing to pay for it.

### Remarks by Child Stars in the Film World

— Xin Ying

Innocence and Romance, Each with Their Own Sentiments

Deanna Durbin: People often ask me, "What kind of man do you want to marry in the future?" I tell them that this question reminds me of the girls in the city who used to curse and no longer wanted to marry a farmer—but now they are milking cows!

Mikhail Rasumny: My method of writing a song is to make it fit the score, so I have to study the score first. The score is a hint to the lyrics. If you study it carefully, it is easy to write the lyrics. But after the score is finished, I feel that I can't think of a good name. Perhaps this is the most difficult thing in writing a song.

Shirley Temple: When I was little, I liked to grow up and open a cake shop. Later, I wanted to be an upper-class person—but now I am a little vague about this matter and don't know what to do in the future. I don't like pastries. I can't be a gentleman either; therefore, I imagine that maybe I will be a housewife.

Jackie Cooper: In this film city, money is indeed taken lightly. How could ordinary people have a daughter who can earn ten dollars a week? My father is the same. So I told him that I would work hard in the future, and he allowed me to have fifteen dollars a week for pocket money.

Linda Ware: When I first went to shoot "The Star Maker," I was almost scared to death, and when I first faced the camera, I was almost a fool. Now these are over. I know how I should work. The only hope is to continue to make movies.

Carolyn Lee (four years old, "Honeymoon In Bali" is her debut). I am most happy every time I see my own photo in the newspaper, because this means that the film company is getting back the money they gave me for working for them before.

Virginia Weidler: I hope to star in "Taming of The Shrew" on stage when I grow up. I think there are probably twelve years left. At that time, I will be twenty-four years old and should know how to perform plays on stage.

Recommended to Men and Women with Guts

Mr. Wu Yonggang has recently completed the film "Yue Fei Devotes Himself to the Country." The writer has seen the trial screening and briefly describes his impressions as follows:

In the past, I didn't pay attention to this script. I only knew that Xinhua was making a movie about Yue Fei. I privately thought that the stories adopted were the twelve gold medals and the Fengbo Pavilion, etc. What is now extracted is from Yue Fei's entry into school to seizing Xiao Liang Wang. What the director wants the audience to know is not the great achievements of General Yue's battles, but the director tries hard to emphasize the process of Yue Fei's adulthood, how he studied diligently, how he practiced martial arts diligently, and especially how he forged his iron will. This is the most important part, which determines his future heart of sacrificing himself to defend the country.

This story cannot have a romance. It must develop in a tense and serious tone. The director also tries his best to achieve this. He avoids mediocre transitional scenes everywhere, and makes big and small climaxes appear one after another. The so-called climax here does not necessarily refer to lively and stimulating books, but also includes profound dialogues. The aim is to make the audience deeply impressed by Yue's mother's way of teaching her son, Zhou Tong's patient guidance, and Yue Fei's perseverance.

The writer would like to recommend this work to men and women with guts. After you have seen too many love stories, and then take a look at "Yue Fei Devotes Himself to the Country," you will be awestruck, and your mind will be awakened like a spoonful of cold water poured over it.

### "Ninotchka" Great Comedy, Greta Garbo Changes Style

— Yun Yun

The mysterious lady Greta Garbo, whose face appears on the screen, always has a cold face, as if she has experienced a lot of worldly affairs, and her facial muscles have been stimulated to loosen. She is unwilling to leave a trace of a smile for the world to see. In the past two years, this famous female artist has been separated from fans for a long time. She needs to rest and she needs to be silent. She wants to meet the world in the silver screen with a new attitude.

This time, Garbo's wish has come true. In "Ninotchka," she not only sings and dances, but especially shows a smile, making the whole world laugh with her, laughing heartily. Undoubtedly, this is a brand new page in Garbo's work history. The most famous director genius Ernst Lubitsch is responsible for the whole film. He handles the whole play in a way that is neither detached nor sticky, just right, especially a kind of "Lubitsch touch." Only this Ernst Lubitsch has this kind of humorous style.

We have seen a lot of Garbo's tragedies. Her profound acting skills have aroused resonance in the hearts of many people. In performances like "Ninotchka," Garbo's style has indeed changed. She not only has great achievements in tragedy performances, but also has extraordinary success in comedy performances, which proves that her acting skills are multi-faceted. Without great talent, she would not be able to complete them happily.

The plot is about a Soviet Russian female representative who goes to Paris to sell the precious jewelry of the noble ladies of the old Russian era. As a result, the playboy viscount of Paris falls in love with her. The actor playing the viscount is the famous mustached Melvyn Douglas, whose methods of cherishing the weak and protecting the tender are very skillful, turning the steel heart of this Soviet Russian female representative into a soft silk.

This "Ninotchka" is a rare unprecedented comedy. It is expected that after its release, there will be an amazing sensation!
