### Germany to Take Action on Greenland

Stockholm – It is generally expected here that Germany will take action on the east coast of Greenland in the near future, as after September, sea routes to Greenland will be blocked by ice, and the huts in the settlements will be submerged in snow, making them difficult to identify from the air. It is common knowledge that Canadian troops are stationed in Iceland, and it is suspected that Canadian forces also hold strategic positions in Greenland. The few settlements on the east coast of the island are very useful for weather reports and are of great value for predicting North Sea weather, greatly aiding air traffic between Britain and the mainland.

Some small villages were hit by more than two hundred bombs, with only one small fire breaking out in the fields. A coastal area was subjected to three long air raids in twelve hours, with German aircraft dropping several high-explosive bombs, most of which landed in the sea, causing severe damage to one house, but no casualties. In another area, four workers' residences were destroyed, resulting in some deaths and injuries. According to the Air Ministry, an airman recently awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross discovered a Heinkel bomber over a city in Surrey and gave chase, eventually shooting it down off the south-central coast. According to official announcements, the main targets of yesterday's German air raids were London and Portsmouth, resulting in at least about forty-five German aircraft being shot down by the British, forty of which were destroyed by British fighter planes. (Reuters, 25th)

London - German aircraft continued to drop incendiary and high-explosive bombs in the London area this morning. A hospital, a factory, and many other buildings and residences were hit and damaged.

London Area Suffers Three Air Raids

London - Air raid alerts were frequent throughout Britain yesterday. There were three air raid alerts in the London area, the third of which was issued late at night, as of 8:30 PM (5:30 AM Shanghai time). According to official reports, forty-five enemy aircraft have been destroyed, including forty shot down by British fighter planes. Two sudden cannon booms were heard, alarming London residents returning home from theaters and movie houses. Then searchlights illuminated the sky, and after a few minutes, the sound of aircraft could be heard. London traffic continued to operate, but the number of pedestrians decreased. An explosion was heard from the east. Before long, bombs fell within the London area, and in a few minutes, a red glow filled the sky, and flames shot up into the heavens like shooting stars. Flames reaching 150 feet could be seen from the Reuters rooftop, with sparks and debris flying everywhere. The fire department immediately responded. According to observers, the scene resembled a volcanic eruption. Before the night raid, about eighty German aircraft appeared in the London sky at a high altitude, in the afternoon. As soon as they reached the suburbs, they were bombarded with heavy anti-aircraft fire, and British fighters took off to pursue them. The enemy aircraft turned north, and the British aircraft followed closely. The enemy aircraft then took refuge in the clouds. A moment later, a loud noise, like an exploding bomb, was heard in London. Another large group of German bombers, protected by fighter planes, attempted to reach London at an altitude of 20,000 feet. British fighters met them head-on, shooting down one Heinkel bomber and one fighter plane. Although many bombs fell, there have been no reports of major damage. (Reuters, 25th)

The flames from the destroyed buildings lit up the sky, black smoke billowed into the air, and sparks flew in all directions. A United Press reporter in Kensington heard six or seven distant explosions, but the details were unclear. The all-clear signal was issued at 1:28 AM this morning (9:28 AM Shanghai summer time). The air combat yesterday covered a wide area, and the enemy aircraft flew very high. The Royal Air Force engaged the German aircraft before they reached the British coast. The Germans initially attempted to destroy Britain's grain harvest, dropping hundreds of incendiary bombs in the southwestern agricultural region, but the damage was minimal. Twenty-four German bombers attempting to fly from the southeast coast to the center were intercepted by British "Hurricane" aircraft and turned back. It is reported that the losses from yesterday's air raids were the most significant suffered since the start of the war. (United Press, 25th)

German Forces Bombard Southeastern Corner of England

(Haitong Telegraph, 30th)

British Air Force Bombs German Territory

Northwestern, Dutch, Belgian, and German airfields and other targets.

Three British aircraft did not return. According to details released by the Air Ministry's intelligence department, the main targets of British bomber raids on Friday night were airfields in occupied France, as these airfields are where German aircraft take off for raids on Britain. The large military air base in Courbevoie, a suburb of Paris, and several airfields in the southern Brittany region were bombed. After the airfields in Lisieux and Caen in the Normandy region were attacked, flames lit up the sky. Airfields and flying ports in Orléans and other places were also attacked. In addition, gun emplacements near Cap Gris-Nez on the French coast were repeatedly attacked by medium-sized British bombers in alternating raids lasting a considerable time. (Reuters, 25th)

Editorial

### Konoe's New Order Movement

Japan's New Order Movement, since its advocate Fumimaro Konoe seized power, has been intensifying and taking a sharp turn for the worse. The Preparatory Committee for the Establishment of the New Order, its central guiding body, was organized on the 23rd. In addition to the participation of all current cabinet ministers, 26 people from the private sector were selected as committee members, with Konoe himself serving as chairman. A statement on the New Order will be submitted to the cabinet meeting tomorrow (27th), preparing to produce a concrete organizational plan by the end of September for implementation. Tracing back to the so-called "innovation" and "unification" issues that have been in turmoil for nearly ten years since the "May 15th Incident", it has now entered the initial stage of concretion, and the party parliamentary politics that Japan has practiced since the Meiji Restoration has come to a thorough end. This is a major change in Japanese political history. Although its central idea has been announced, the way forward remains to be decided, so it is not possible to fully criticize its merits and demerits at this time. However, recent Japanese circumstances and public opinion indicate that the so-called New Order itself is still full of thorns; as to whether Japan's current predicament can be remedied by this change seems to be a distant question.

During this Sino-Japanese war, the morale of the Japanese military and people is far inferior to that of the past Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars. Japanese discussion has repeatedly pointed this out over the years; and this New Order Movement, if it is the so-called "Showa Restoration", then the support and embrace of the people is far less comparable to the previous Meiji Restoration. The calls for "innovation" over the years have always only revolved among military men and politicians. The general public in Japanese society has lacked enthusiasm for this from the beginning and sometimes even has a more conservative tendency, pinning their hopes on the existing parties and the conservative camp. This situation should be the first hurdle for the New Order Movement. According to Japanese sources, the lower-level organization of this movement will be based on the neighborhood association system and industrial groups, but whether this top-down push can truly stimulate the strong potential of the people is a huge question. Therefore, it is necessary to diagnose that the foundation of such a New Order Movement is indeed quite weak.

The main cause of political changes in Japan is often not internal, but external, and major changes are even more so. What prompted the Meiji Restoration was Japan's humiliation by Western countries and the success of 19th-century international capitalism and liberalism; what prompted this "innovation" movement was the failure of the invasion war in China and the initial victory of German and Italian totalitarianism in the European war. The Meiji Restoration learned the forms of democracy but did not change its inherent social and political traditions; this New Order Movement also only imitated the forms of the totalitarian system, lacking its strong impetus and foundation. Italy's corporatist system and Germany's state-owned enterprises are not something that Japan can achieve today. The feudal nature of the industrial world and the opposition of various social forces can only be forcibly eliminated and unified with the momentum and strength of thunder. Although Japanese public and private enterprises are said to have been controlled by the government under the gradual implementation of the General Mobilization Law, it only adapts to wartime needs and is far from being able to speak of "unification" of the industrial world. Look at how indifferent the financial world is to this New Order Movement! In the lineup of the preparatory committee, there are even fewer financial figures than politicians or journalists, and none of the industrial giants participated, so it is not difficult to imagine how the Japanese financial world views the so-called "innovation" movement. The rapid disintegration of existing parties has indeed removed some difficulties for Konoe, but it can only be seen as a cover-up for their own weaknesses by politicians who act according to circumstances; therefore, the New Order will not only inevitably encounter new resistance from the financial and industrial world, but it is also very likely that there will be a counter-reaction from politicians who act according to circumstances.

But the biggest difficulty for Konoe's movement still lies in the military! The main problem in the past Japanese political situation was the separation and opposition of facts and politics. Even during the war, it failed to merge seamlessly and constantly caused political disputes. In Konoe's personal ambition, it may not be focused on the establishment of "political-military unification", and he had previously flaunted the integration of the commander, legislation, and administration, but there are only two ways to achieve this: either the government dominates the military power or the military completely dominates the government. However, the former is impossible in fact, and the latter is certainly not what Konoe is willing to do. Even within the military, the views and styles on politics and the military are not unified. In the selection of members of this preparatory committee, almost all of the so-called "innovation giants" are included, and only a few figures from the disbanded parties are decorated; it is said that Konoe did this in order to maintain the balance of political forces in all sectors, but the military has expressed dissatisfaction, believing that there is a lack of new and bold figures. Minister of the Army Tada Shun even met with Konoe to express his opinion on promoting new figures, urging Konoe to reconsider (see yesterday's Continental News). Although the preparatory committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting on the 28th, it is said that it may not be possible to avoid new waves at that time. Such an atmosphere is nowhere to be found in Italy's march on Rome and the Nazi Party's seizure of power in Germany, and cannot be compared with them. Therefore, the domestic political achievements gained by Italy and Germany due to the totalitarian system are also difficult to imagine being repeated in Japan in the future; as for the external achievements, the opportunities are even more different.

The victory or defeat of a war depends not only on the military's progress or retreat but also on whether the domestic political situation is stable and strong. The repeated changes in the French cabinet this spring were not without a causal connection to its final defeat. And this time Japan's reform of the political system is deeper and wider than the political turmoil of previous years; as a result, at most it forms a temporary political strength, and it is impossible to hope for stability, let alone health. Seeing it as a bold adventure, it is only trying its last resort.

### After Chongqing Bombing, Order is Quickly Restored; Small Shops Appear in the City; Authorities Cook Porridge Along the Streets to Aid Refugees

Chongqing - The order in Chongqing has been rapidly restored in the days following the bombing. The streets have been cleared, and construction teams are busy demolishing the burnt brick walls and dangerous structures. Temporary sleeping platforms have been set up along the streets, and small shops have appeared, selling a wide variety of goods. The rice market is concentrated in the Wuku Street and Jiaochangkou area, where trading is particularly busy. Every morning, as the various agencies go to work, the city looks most vibrant, with frequent vehicles and pedestrians walking briskly, full of a spirit of striving. Standing in the street, it is hard to believe that this is the same place that was狂炸 bombarded by the Japanese a few days ago. (25th Dispatch)

Chongqing - As a result of the continuous bombing by Japanese aircraft, the number of refugees in Chongqing has reached more than 2,000. In addition to providing food and accommodation, the authorities are also providing each person with a subsidy of one yuan per day. According to estimates by the municipal government, it would cost 100,000 yuan in labor and materials to build temporary shelters for these refugees. In addition, the New Life Movement Association is still collecting donations for refugees from all parties, and donations are pouring in from all over the country. (Havas, 25th)

Chongqing - Due to the great fires on the 19th and 20th, many businesses in Chongqing were burned down, and all trading came to a standstill. The Chongqing Chamber of Commerce convened an emergency joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees to discuss ways to restore the market. It was decided that each industry association would set up its own trading market, and retail shops would build houses on their original sites to maintain the livelihood of businessmen. Those who cannot build their own houses will be assisted by the industry association to set up joint business premises. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Central Trust Bureau will be requested to expand the scope of war risk insurance. (Havas News Agency, 25th)

Chongqing - After days of indiscriminate bombing by Japanese aircraft, the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce has issued an appeal to all countries, requesting effective international action to stop Japan from bombing Chongqing and other undefended cities. The telegram also quoted Chairman Chiang's remarks, stating that the Chinese people's morale has not been destroyed by bombs, and their determination to resist aggression has become even stronger. (Havas News Agency, 25th)

Chongqing - As a result of the repeated bombing of Chongqing by Japanese aircraft, there are a large number of citizens who have lost their homes. The authorities have set up粥 porridge kitchens on the streets to provide food for the refugees. Madame Soong Mei-ling, wife of General Chiang Kai-shek, chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, personally inspected the various porridge kitchens today and expressed her condolences to the refugees. It is said that the situation in all places is good and quite satisfactory. Huang Renlin, Secretary-General of the New Life Movement Association, said that the porridge soup should not be too thin and should be slightly thicker. It is learned that the association has set up a total of ten粥 porridge kitchens, which can provide food for 30,000 refugees per day. In addition, the government authorities have taken various air defense measures. In order to prevent the spread of fire, they plan to build "fire prevention wells". Every fifteen houses must be demolished to make room. In this way, even if a fire breaks out after the bombing, it will be easier to extinguish. Also, several bombs landed near the German Embassy during the Japanese bombing yesterday. (Havas, 24th)

### Germany Decides Not to Allow Japan to Interfere in Vietnam; Vietnam's Territorial Integrity Guaranteed by Germany; France Allows Germany to Establish Bases in Vietnam

London - A French writer recently made a statement saying that Japan's current recall of diplomatic envoys is the result of French Foreign Minister Baudouin's consultations with Germany on the Vietnam issue. According to German Ambassador to Japan, Ott, to Japanese officials, Germany's decision not to allow Japan to interfere in French Vietnam is because the Japanese government failed to fulfill its promises to cooperate with Hitler when Germany was conducting a major war in Europe. In fact, Hitler and Japan never agreed on any cooperation plan between the two countries. However, during the six weeks of Germany's blitzkrieg against Britain, the German Ambassador to Japan, Ott, repeatedly visited the Japanese Foreign Minister. It is said that the discussions were about Japan launching a fierce attack on British, French, and American territories in the Far East while Germany was attacking Britain, and strongly advocated that Japan should reconcile with Moscow. If so, the United States would be extremely busy in the Pacific, and Britain would not be able to concentrate all of its troops in the home country. It is said that the reward promised to Japan at that time was Germany's recognition of Japan's position in Vietnam. However, despite the efforts of the German ambassador, Japan did not fulfill its promise to Germany, because Japan's ability to launch this blitzkrieg was very weak during this difficult period. French Foreign Minister Baudouin has obtained guarantees from Germany on the issue of Vietnamese territory and will inevitably make various economic and industrial concessions to Germany. Baudouin has allowed Germany to build several bases in Vietnam. We cannot say that Baudouin's move has already saved Vietnam, but Germany's victory is becoming more and more unsettling. Baudouin's move may save Vietnam in the future. On the Japanese side, pro-German factions supported by the army and navy have expressed opposition to the Konoe Cabinet, saying that the difficulties caused by the anti-German policy in the Far East, especially the loss of Vietnam, are the responsibility of the Konoe Cabinet. The Japanese have been coveting a piece of land in Vietnam for fifty years. This is the reason why the Japanese government decided to recall all diplomatic personnel and convene a meeting of famous political parties to establish a new fascist Nazi constitution. (United Press report from the 25th)

Chongqing - The Central Daily News recently published an article warning France not to yield to Japan's demands on Vietnam. The newspaper said that if France gives way to Japan, it should bear the responsibility for all the consequences. China will never tolerate Japan's invasion of Vietnam. Even if France caters to Japan's demands, Vietnam will inevitably face the scourge of war. It is hoped that the Vichy government can make a wise decision on this matter. (United Press report from the 25th)

Chongqing - People on the Chinese side pointed out that the rumors recently spread about Chinese troops crossing the Vietnamese border were deliberately propagated by the Japanese side in order to create an atmosphere for the Japanese army to invade French territory. (Reuters report from the 25th)

### Japanese Troops Northeast of Anyi Failed to Invade Southward

### The Pingjin and Pinghan Railways Have Been Cut Off

Beiping - The Japanese side recently admitted that the Eighth Route Army is active. It is now learned from responsible sources that the rural areas around Beiping are also quite unstable. The northeast and east gates of Ping City are open in the morning, but the south gate is opened later. This is probably related to the rumor that the Eighth Route Army has occupied Qizhou near Beiping. It is now confirmed that the Pingjin Railway was cut off yesterday, and trains were blocked for several hours. Train traffic on the Pinghan Railway was also blocked. No trains can pass south of Gaoyi, not far south of Shijiazhuang. According to unconfirmed news, guerrillas assassinated and coerced the Yuanmingyuan. (Reuters report from the 25th)

Chongqing - A spokesperson for the Military Commission stated that the fiercest battles from the 18th to the 24th of this month were in Hubei, Henan, Shanxi, Guangxi, and Shandong. The major battles of the past week are summarized as follows:

Hubei

The Japanese troops entrenched in Yichang sent out small units to harass in all directions, which were resolved by the Chinese army separately. The strongholds on both sides of the Xiang River were often attacked by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops in the Zhongxiang and Jingshan areas are suffering from epidemics and are unlikely to invade again.

Henan

The Japanese troops near Qinyang once advanced from Shanwangzhuang north of the city to Xiwanzhuang. They were met by the Chinese army and engaged in a fierce battle for more than four hours. The Japanese retreated due to lack of support. At the same time, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops in Shuitou Village, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese. The Japanese troops who harassed Xiaoweiying were intercepted by the Chinese army on different routes, and most of them returned without success. The Japanese troops north of Jiaozuo advanced towards Shanmenkou and were defeated by the Chinese army in a flank attack. At the same time, the Japanese troops in Shangxiang, southeast of Qinyang, advanced southward on three routes towards Dongxi Wangzhuang, and were wiped out by the Chinese army separately.

Shanxi

A unit of Japanese troops in Gongling, southeast of Jincheng, has been using artillery fire to cover their eastward advance towards the Qingliansi Beizhuang area, engaging in fierce battles with the Chinese army. More than 300 Japanese soldiers were killed, and they retreated due to lack of support. Near Dongzhen on the Tongpu Railway, the Japanese triggered a Chinese landmine, destroying one troop transport vehicle and one locomotive, as well as three carriages, killing more than 100 Japanese soldiers. The Chinese seized a large amount of military supplies. The Japanese troops entrenched in Wanquan, Yishi, and Wenxi have been harassing in all directions in recent days. The Chinese have inflicted heavy blows on them separately, and the Japanese have been seriously injured and unable to move.

Guangxi

A unit of Japanese troops in Longzhou has been using artillery fire to cover their advance towards Xia Dong. The Chinese army intercepted them east of Xia Dong, destroying one Japanese gun. The Japanese abandoned more than 100 bodies and fled. About 1,000 Japanese troops advancing southward from Ningming encountered the Chinese army west of Changqiao and engaged in a fierce battle, retreating due to lack of support. The Chinese army, advancing towards various strongholds near Xiaoxun in southern Guangxi, turned to attack the Lingwei and Fenghuang strongholds after reaching the expected locations, rushing in at once and killing for several hours. The Japanese scattered and fled. The Japanese troops in Funan and Wuwei gathered a unit and attempted to advance towards Longtougen and Zhuzhou.

Magazine Argues that the US is Heading Towards War

Washington - The US Army and Navy Magazine argued yesterday that "the United States is rapidly moving towards participating in the World War. Only the blind cannot see this fact. Non-wartime measures have advanced to quasi-wartime measures. We have concluded a defense alliance with Canada, we are leasing British territories in the Western Hemisphere, we are supplying Britain with government military supplies, and we are preparing to strengthen the British navy with outdated destroyers. This is the prelude to sending powerful warships and replenishing aircraft to help Britain. We are mobilizing the countries of the Americas against the Axis powers and notifying the Axis powers that wartime actions cannot occur within the designated areas of the Western Hemisphere, and we are patrolling the above-mentioned areas to protect the territories of European countries in the area. We insist on maintaining the pre-war status quo in the Far East, which is contrary to what the Japanese desire. Based on the above facts, and the threats of Fifth Column activities and work slowdowns, our country urgently needs to eliminate those who prevent the establishment of a strong land, sea, and air force, and eliminate all obstacles to victory. Now is not the time for sophistry, as sophistry will lead to disaster." The magazine claimed that we "cannot tolerate" obstacles preventing the active completion of the international market, and that "Congress must no longer pass the recommendations of national defense officials after discussion. This is a powerful answer to Hitler's mockery that democratic countries cannot accomplish anything." (United Press report from the 25th)

### German Warship Sinks British Ship in Australian Waters; Germany Claims to Have Sunk 100,000 Tons of Enemy Ships Since the Week-Long Blockade

Berlin - According to a Haitong News Agency reporter, the British ship "Drakonera," sunk by a German warship in Australian waters, was a ship transporting butter.

### Soviet Production Plan Completed Ahead of Schedule

Moscow - The Soviet Union celebrated the fifth anniversary of the Stakhanovite movement (increased production movement) throughout the country. Miners at the Duna Zhi Mine have already completed their eight-month production plan ahead of schedule, and the coal produced has exceeded the original plan by hundreds of thousands of tons. Oil miners are also not far behind. "Stalin Nav," the largest oil refinery in the Ashbejan Republic, has completed its eight-month production plan, and the amount of oil obtained has exceeded the original plan by 14,000 tons. To commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Stakhanovite movement, workers at the Thames Nav Factory dug a 1,180-meter-deep oil pool. Regarding smelting steel work, workers at the Gu Nazhi Factory also achieved amazing results. Railway workers have made great contributions to transporting heavy goods. For example, railway workers at the Anan Ji Fu Station have exceeded the original plan for transporting metals and coal in July, with 44,000 tons of coal and 2,500 tons of metals. At the same time, Chaimlink workers transported 80 freight cars in just ten days. In terms of machinery manufacturing, the output of the Claire McMax Factory in Leningrad has exceeded the original plan for July by 3%. The workers of the factory decided to dedicate 1,100 tons of smelted metals to the country on the fifth anniversary. The productivity of textile workers has also exceeded the planned targets, such as the output of various weaving factories in the Moscow region, which has exceeded the original plan for seven months. Fishery factories in the Caspian Sea have also completed their plans ahead of schedule. At the same time, socialist farmers are all striving to increase production with all their strength.

### Indian Government Prohibits Military Drills

Simla - The Indian government issued a public announcement criticizing the resolution passed by the Standing Committee of the All-India Congress two days ago (the resolution mentioned the activities prohibited by the government order of August 5 and ordered the Congress volunteers to continue their routine). It reiterated that military-style drills and wearing military-like or formal uniforms are no longer legal activities. This ban is not aimed at dealing with any particular group, but is formulated in accordance with Indian defense laws. The drills and uniforms of the army and police all have a purpose, which is to show off military power. Imitating the methods of the army, the public will consider it to have the same purpose. No government can tolerate a non-formal group with this purpose, or any group claiming that this method is necessary for its existence. This ban will be even stricter for groups that openly declare non-violent resistance. According to the Congress, the organization of volunteers aims to promote social harmony and maintain local order. (Reuters report from the 25th)

### Luo and Bao Successfully Negotiate Redefinition of Borders; Hungary-Romania Negotiations Halted Mid-Course; Hope for Resumption Under German and Italian Pressure; Hungarian Delegation Departs Severin

Bucharest - Negotiations between Romania and Bulgaria regarding Dobruja concluded last night in Craiova. An agreement was successfully negotiated and is expected to be signed by the end of the week. However, negotiations between Romania and Hungary in Turnu Severin concerning Outer Transylvania suddenly broke down yesterday without any result. The Hungarian delegation withdrew from the meeting at 2:00 PM, boarded their ship on the Danube, and returned to Budapest that evening. According to a Romanian representative, the Hungarian response was unacceptable to Romania, either today or in the future. (Reuter, 25th)

Severin - The Hungarian delegation departed from here by special train for Budapest at 10:45 AM yesterday. The Danube steamship "Sophia," which the delegation used to arrive here, is scheduled to depart this morning. The Romanian delegation is expected to depart for Bucharest today. The leader of the Hungarian delegation expressed approval of Romania's proposed borderlines for the ceded area and will report them to the Hungarian government. The Romanian delegation leader stated that the new proposal is based on the principle of population exchange, and Romania has requested Hungary to make this principle a prerequisite for the proposed demarcation lines. It is likely that the two delegations will continue negotiations in Sinaia, but Hungary has suggested continuing negotiations within Hungarian territory. The earliest date for the resumption of negotiations is the 28th or 29th. (Haitong Press, 25th) Budapest - The breakdown of the Romania-Hungary negotiations was officially announced last night. The announcement stated, "The negotiations between the Romanian and Hungarian delegations broke down at 2:00 PM on August 24th. The Hungarian delegation has left Severin and returned to Budapest. The main reason for the breakdown is that Romania has provided no answer to Hungary's specific proposals regarding the new border." Semi-official sources here anticipate that Hungary's future actions will now involve consulting with Germany and Italy. (Haitong Press, 25th)

Severin - Both the Romanian and Hungarian delegations departed from here today. It has been learned from here that regarding the issue of adjusting the borders between Hungary and Romania, both parties will continue negotiations on the 28th or 29th, but possibly not in Severin. Well-informed sources claim that Romania is prepared to discuss the new border entirely based on Hungary's ability to accept population exchange. (Haitong Wire, 25th)

Compromise Reached on Border Issue Between Bulgaria and Romania

Sofia - The Bulgarian cabinet held an extraordinary cabinet meeting last night to discuss Romania's proposal regarding the incorporation of Southern Dobruja. According to reports, an agreement has been reached on the border issue. Romania's proposal concerns only the date and procedure for the transfer of Southern Dobruja. As of the time of this dispatch, no report has been issued on the outcome of the cabinet meeting. (Haitong Press, 25th)

Bucharest - In order to promote friendly relations with Romania, Bulgaria, during the negotiations in Craiova on the Southern Dobruja issue, automatically agreed to return the Romanian royal palace in Balchik to Romanian property and grant it extraterritorial rights. Furthermore, before Romania builds a new route, Romania will be allowed to use the highway passing through Southern Dobruja from Bucharest to Constanța. (Haitong Wire, 25th)

Bucharest - According to information received last night from well-informed sources here, the Romanian side has decided to set October 10th as the date for the withdrawal of residents from Southern Dobruja. The Romanian Prime Minister officially declared yesterday that, effective immediately, residents of Southern Dobruja may move their property to the Romanian interior. The harvest in the area this year will remain Romanian property, and therefore must also be transferred to Romania after the harvest. (Haitong Wire, 25th)

Sofia - Administrative heads of Bulgarian provinces gathered at the Ministry of Interior yesterday to discuss the future administration of Southern Dobruja. According to well-informed sources, Southern Dobruja is temporarily designated as an independent province of Bulgaria, and administrative heads will be selected from officials of the central government, not residents of the province. (Haitong Wire, 25th)

Southern Dobruja: Residents Evacuated in Batches

Bucharest - It has been announced here that Romania's withdrawal of residents from Southern Dobruja will be carried out in three phases, and should be completed by October 10th. The Romanian Prime Minister has issued a proclamation stating that residents of Caliacra and Durostor can immediately begin moving their property to the interior to facilitate future withdrawal. Residents within the ceded area do not need to relocate urgently. All agricultural products that should belong to Romania must also be moved into Romania. The spirit of the Bulgaria-Romania negotiations is extremely friendly, and there is nothing to fear. Romanians can take their property with them. (Haitong Press, 25th)

German Statement on the Breakdown of Romania-Hungary Negotiations

Severin - After the breakdown of the Romania-Hungary negotiations, the official gazette was originally scheduled to be published at 6:00 PM yesterday, but it has been postponed. According to Mr. Henriques, a special correspondent of the Haitong Press who inquired with the participating delegates, the details of the negotiation breakdown are as follows:

"The Hungarian Minister to Romania, Bardossy, previously visited the Romanian Foreign Minister, Manoilescu, informing him that if Romania was prepared to resolve the territorial issue, then Hungary was prepared to negotiate. Manoilescu replied that the resolution of the territorial issue included the exchange of minorities between the two countries. The Hungarian delegation sent to Severin for negotiations then insisted that the negotiation process should begin with the territorial issue and then proceed to the issue of population exchange. On August 19th, the chief Hungarian delegate, Horthy, declared at the meeting that if this procedure was not followed, then the negotiations must be stopped. At yesterday's meeting, the Hungarian delegation requested the Romanian side to explain Romania's proposal regarding the border, but the Romanian representative replied that this was impossible, only promising to submit a statistical report in the afternoon explaining the results on the border after the exchange of minorities. The Hungarian representative then believed that the Romanian representative was deliberately delaying and declared the negotiations interrupted. The Hungarian representative then asked whether Romania agreed to the following negotiation procedure: (1) Determine the border; (2) Exchange populations. The chief Romanian delegate, Pop, gave a negative answer. The Hungarian representative then asked, "Then how does Romania think the border issue should be resolved?" Pop replied, "Resolve it by exchanging populations." The chief Hungarian delegate, Horthy, then believed that the negotiations had broken down and requested the Romanian government to publish the Hungarian request within 24 hours. At the same time, the Hungarian delegates decided to leave Severin and return to their country. One noteworthy point of this Romania-Hungary meeting is that the language used was German, changing the usual practice of using French, which is quite innovative. (Haitong Wire, 25th)

Hungarian Highway and Railway Traffic Partially Suspended

Budapest - Yesterday, 14 routes were suspended, and taxi services will also be subject to strict restrictions. According to the National Railway Administration, several railway lines will also be suspended due to various technical difficulties. (Haitong Press, 25th)

Breakdown of Romania-Hungary Negotiations Not Expected to Lead to Armed Conflict

New York - Experts here who study Balkan issues believe that the breakdown of Romania-Hungary negotiations in Severin regarding (Outer Transylvania) is not surprising, because Hungary's demands include 75 percent of the province's territory, while King Carol of Romania is only willing to cede a very narrow strip of land. Since the opinions of both sides are so disparate, it is naturally tending toward a breakdown. As for the reported military actions in the Balkans, there is no reason to be alarmed. Such actions are common in Southeastern Europe. While both sides may inevitably exchange gunfire, or even engage in more serious incidents, a real war is unlikely to occur. If war were to break out, it would affect Germany's Balkan supplies. Romania and Hungary are currently both under the complete control of the Axis powers. Strictly speaking, they are both under Hitler's influence. Before allowing Romania and Hungary to conduct negotiations, Berlin and Rome must have first determined the limits that Romania should concede, hoping to maintain the face of both King Carol of Romania and Regent Nicholas of Hungary, the heads of the two "independent countries." We believe that both Romania and Hungary will appeal to Rome and Berlin, requesting arbitration, because both Romania and Hungary know that if they do not appeal to the Axis powers, the Axis powers may implement a decision that would cause both to lose their national dignity. As for the method of resolution, it seems to us that Romania will cede a 50-kilometer-long area around the so-called "Carol" Line, a weak Romanian-style Maginot Line, as well as important towns such as Satu Mare, Arad, Maramureș, and Timișoara to Hungary. The Hungarian residents of these cities, as well as 70,000 Romanians in Hungary, would then be exchanged and relocated. (United Press, 25th)

Rome - According to semi-official sources here, a squadron of Italian bombers, covered by fighter planes, attacked the British airfield in Malta from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM yesterday. A fierce air battle immediately broke out, resulting in the downing of three British planes.

### Soviet Naval Report Claims Spain Actively Preparing for War, Beneficial to Germany and Italy

Moscow - Regarding the recent steps taken by the Spanish government, the "Red Fleet Daily" commented, "The Spanish government recently ordered ships to return to neutral zones or return home, and implemented strict inspections, etc. This situation proves that Spain is actively preparing for war. After Spain participates in the war, it will provide the German and Italian navies with new naval bases. Spanish bases in Cadiz and the Balearic Islands will allow the German and Italian navies to extend their attacks on Gibraltar. At the same time, British ships will have to detour far away and constantly feel the threat of Germany and Italy. As for the British Navy's defense of Gibraltar, the tactic of striking east and attacking west will benefit German operations in the North Sea. In addition, Spain has many airfields, and the air force can be used in any direction. On the other hand, Britain does not have an airfield in that part of the Mediterranean. In short, Spain's actions are all convenient for Germany and Italy to seize Gibraltar." (Wire, 25th)

### Denies Soviet Request to Turkey

Moscow - According to foreign newspapers, a few days ago, the Soviet government requested Turkey to allow the Soviet navy to pass through the Dardanelles Strait after the outbreak of war in the Balkans. This record has been officially denied here. (TASS, 25th)

### Although British Troops Retreat, They Do Not Abandon Interests in China; Third Batch of 600 British Soldiers Retreats Yesterday; Dozens Remaining in Shanghai Will Also Depart

Since the British garrison in Shanghai began to retreat, the first batch of 300 people left Shanghai on the 21st of this month, and the second batch of 600 people also retreated on the 23rd of this month. Yesterday at 1:00 PM, another approximately 600 soldiers from the First Company of the Seaforth Highlanders, were warmly seen off by Chinese and foreign residents, boarded their ship and bid farewell. By now, the British garrison in Shanghai has almost completely retreated, with only a few dozen people remaining.

According to a report in a certain newspaper on the 17th of this month, the British Jardine Matheson recently sold part of its property on Loujia Road in this city for Hong Kong dollars, and stated that "observations from various aspects are sufficient to prove that the United Kingdom has made planned withdrawal efforts in the central aspects of China." The general public was quite confused. A reporter from Dazhong News Agency specifically inquired about this with the British authorities. According to reports, this matter is true. Jardine Matheson did sell part of the property to an American church, but this is the second time, because part of the property was also sold last September. It also stated that this matter is only commercial in nature and has no other significance. The saying that the United Kingdom is withdrawing its interests in China is an unbelievable rumor.

One Infantry Company, Totaling Six Hundred People

Yesterday at 12:30 PM, the First Company of the Seaforth Highlanders of the British garrison first gathered at the Racecourse. The U.S. Navy Fourth Regiment band arrived to see them off. At one o'clock, the British troops lined up and exited through the Longfei Gate of the Racecourse. The first was the Indian mounted patrol of the Municipal Police Department, followed by the U.S. McCain's band, then the British military band, and then the First Company of the Seaforth Highlanders infantry, totaling about 600 people.

U.S. Military Band Plays Farewell Music

At that time, Chinese and foreign residents gathered along Nanjing Road, especially foreign residents of this city who accompanied the British troops to the Waibaidu Bridge. The situation was very warm. The British troops were in high spirits, marched neatly, and amidst the sound of military music and the farewells of residents on both sides, they passed through Nanjing Road and turned into the Bund. By the time they reached the front of the British Consulate, it was 1:30 PM. The U.S. military band then played farewell music, exchanged regards, and bid farewell. These British garrison troops then crossed the Waibaidu Bridge amidst the gun salutes of the White Russian Merchant Corps and went straight to the Gonghexiang Wharf to board their ship, which is rumored to be heading to Penang.

The Last Batch is Only Dozens of People

Since this British troop boarded their ship and left Shanghai, there are now only fifty people remaining here, who are expected to make their final withdrawal within the week. The exact date has not yet been set, but it is generally believed that their departure date will be Tuesday (the 27th). As for the few British officers and soldiers left in Tianjin and Beijing, they will arrive in Shanghai within a few days and will join the British troops here to head to an undisclosed destination. The British company's "Naikonda" ship, which transports officials and their families, is also rumored to depart at the same time as the last batch of British troops.

Because the environment in Shanghai is special, all sectors of the city have decided to suspend any ceremonies. In addition to raising flags that day to celebrate in accordance with the concession's approved flag-raising methods, all levels of courts, customs, post offices, and various organizations and schools will take a day off as usual. Since the weather is gradually turning cold, and soldiers and refugees in the front and rear lack winter clothing, the public has decided to launch a winter clothing collection campaign and promote national construction savings to enrich the policy of resistance and national construction.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Adjusts Rent Issues, Procedures Differ from the French Concession, Steps Taken Not Yet Announced

The Shanghai Times reports that the procedures that the Shanghai Municipal Council will adopt to solve the rent problem in the Public Concession are different from the procedures of the French Concession Rent Investigation Committee. This point was confirmed by Philip Felling, Director-General and Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday (August 24th) morning. It is said that it is too early to specify what steps the officials in charge of the situation will take. It is said that the Shanghai Municipal Council has recently announced that it is considering the rent problem, and the responsible officials have engaged in some degree of investigation. It is said that the French Concession followed the order of the French Consulate and organized a Rent Investigation Committee, chaired by Gokayri, legal advisor to the Public Works Bureau, who decided from the beginning

Thorough Investigation

Chinese customs regarding the rent problem and commissioned its subcommittees to actively carry out investigations. This is a necessary step to clarify how the Chinese are accustomed to handling certain rent matters. It is said that the French Concession's committee is an international organization composed of representatives from the four countries with the most

Residents

Chinese, French, British, and Russian. Since its establishment, it has stated that its purpose is definitely not to arbitrate disputes between tenants and landlords, nor does it intend to take any powers of the Chinese courts. The main activity of the committee is to conduct investigations from various aspects, and then provide appropriate recommendations to administrative agencies and judicial organizations to deal with the rent problem that has reached a serious level.

### Wrecked Japanese Ship: Hull Broken, Wreckage Cannot Be Salvaged

The Japanese ship "Chikara Maru," which sailed the Shanghai-Dalian line, after being wrecked at the Outer Tongsha outside the mouth of the Wusong River, suddenly encountered a severe hurricane and drifted to the sea off the seawall of Nanhui. After hearing the news, the ship's company sent personnel to investigate. It is reported that the ship's hull is now completely damaged, broken, and submerged in the sea, and cannot be salvaged. More than a thousand pieces of miscellaneous items and textiles, cigarettes, and paper on board have also floated away with the tide without a trace. The total loss is estimated to be about 100,000 national currency. At present, the wreckage of the ship has been scattered by the waves.

### British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr Departs Shanghai for Chongqing Today, Strengthening Sino-British Cooperation, Takes Special Early Trip

British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, who arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing on June 15th this year, has been very busy dealing with official affairs due to the tense situation in the Far East. Despite the heat, he had no free time, so the plan to go north to escape the heat was also abandoned. He only took a short trip to Weihaiwei for a week at the end of last month. The British Ambassador was originally scheduled to go to Chongqing next month, but in view of the friendly relations between China and the United Kingdom, it is particularly necessary to strengthen cooperation, so he took a special early trip to Chongqing. A reporter from Pingming News Agency specifically inquired with the British authorities in Shanghai about this matter yesterday. It is said that the British Ambassador has decided to leave Shanghai for Hong Kong today. He will make a small stay in Hong Kong and will fly to Chongqing by plane at the end of this month. However, the British authorities were unwilling to disclose which ship the British Ambassador would take to Hong Kong.

### American Authoritative Magazine Praises Admiral Hurd, Argues that the British Defense Area Should Be Divided Between the US and Japan, Admiral Hurd's Firm Advocacy is Praised

Washington, Associated Press, August 25th - The American Army and Navy Journal commented yesterday praising US Asiatic Fleet Commander Admiral Hurd's position on the British military defense area in the Public Concession. The magazine stated, "We must thank Admiral Hurd's firm diplomatic policy for preventing the closure of the crack in the Open Door in China." Admiral Hurd insisted that the defense area of the British troops stationed in Shanghai after their withdrawal must be divided between the American and Japanese armies and cannot be managed by the Japanese army alone. Admiral Hurd arrived in Shanghai by submarine before the defense conference, "which is a good indication of our country's latent Asian maritime power."

British Merchant Corps Take Over Defense in Rotation

Before the area of land formerly defended by British troops is resolved, the defense of B Area continues to be taken over by British units of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps. However, this approach is quite unsettling to Chinese and foreign residents, as everyone hopes that the US military will take over the defense to maintain the status quo of the concession. According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency who inquired with the concession authorities, the British units that have now been called up include A Company, the Armored Vehicle Team, and the Light Cavalry Team. The Light Cavalry Team was on duty from 7:00 PM the day before yesterday to 7:00 PM yesterday. From 7:00 PM last night to 7:00 PM tonight, it was changed to A Company. Afterwards, these three British units will take over in rotation. The rumor that the Japanese side submitted an objection to the Shanghai Municipal Council against A Company (i.e., the First Company) taking over the defense of the western Hongkou area is not true. The Japanese side is objecting to the merchant corps of nationalities other than British, and its purpose is purely directed at the US B Company (i.e., the Second Company).

### Guilin Church Hospital Bombed - Telegrams Sent to Shanghai for Negotiation - Three Bombs Dropped, Losses Amounting to 100,000 Yuan - Photos of Destroyed Buildings Sent to America for Public Announcement

The hospital established by the American Baptist Church in Sihuai Street, Guilin, was bombed with three bombs at 3:30 AM on the 24th (of this month) during an air raid. The hospital wards were completely destroyed. The total loss, including medicine and building construction costs, amounts to approximately 100,000 yuan. It is noted that the roofs of the hospital buildings were all painted with clear flag markings. Now, having been suddenly bombed, the American院长 of the hospital telegraphed the Shanghai General Association about the damage caused by the Japanese planes destroying a third country’s property, requesting that the American Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Peck, negotiate with the Japanese side. At the same time, photographs of the destroyed buildings on Sihuai Street have been taken, printed, and sent to America for public announcement.

### Maintaining Shanghai's Grain Reserves - Continued Purchase of Foreign Rice - Still Under the Leadership and Planning of the Chamber of Commerce

While domestic rice is entering the market and the public food problem is gradually easing, the authorities of the two concessions in this city and the Public Food Adjustment Association still hope that all sectors will continue to participate in group purchases of foreign rice, so that Shanghai can maintain a rich reserve for a long time. Furthermore, according to an economist who spoke to the reporter, the purchase of foreign rice, generally speaking, causes an outflow of national resources. As foreign rice continuously enters the country, domestic farmers will feel threatened and unable to sell their grains. However, this statement holds true during normal times, but not entirely so during extraordinary times, especially at this time and in this place. This point is no longer a concern. Unfortunately, Shanghai has now become a special zone. Although a small amount of the funds remaining in Shanghai flow into the interior for the development of the southwest, most of it is floating capital. Today, speculation harms people's livelihoods, largely facilitated by this capital. The Chinese authorities feel they have no way to manage or utilize this type of floating capital. Therefore, the funds remaining in Shanghai are no different from those flowing into Saigon and Siam. Using them to purchase rice necessary for Shanghai citizens can be considered appropriate. It is also understood that future group purchases of foreign rice will still be led and orchestrated by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which will notify all industries to be responsible for handling investigation, registration, ordering, distribution, and other matters, while the authorities of the two concessions will supervise and guide from the sidelines, so that the difficulties of public food supply can be resolved as soon as possible.

### Amidst the Horrors of Bombing - Chongqing Maintains Normality - Work on Both Government and Civilian Sides Has Never Stopped - Medicines Detained in Vietnam Are Being Negotiated for Release

(A Conversation with an American Staff Member of the International Red Cross Who Came to Shanghai)

According to the Continental News, an American staff member of the International Red Cross recently arrived here from Chongqing. According to him, although Chongqing suffered from the devastation of Japanese planes this summer, the Chinese government's confidence that China can fight indefinitely remains as strong as ever. Before Chongqing was bombed, the old city had already been

(almost completely evacuated)

Thirty foreign commercial firms, whose offices in the old city have been destroyed or heavily damaged, are still operating in the so-called safe zone on the south bank of the Yangtze River. These firms moved to their new locations on the south bank a long time ago, so there were no valuables in the destroyed offices. It is natural that Chongqing is disturbed by the bombing, but government and civilian

(work on both sides)

has never stopped. The closure of the Vietnam Highway has significantly impacted the continuation of relief work within "Free China." Unless the highway reopens in three months, the International Red Cross will be forced to suspend its activities temporarily. When the Vietnam Highway was closed, the International Red Cross tried to transport

(the stockpiled in Haiphong)

160 tons of medical supplies into China, leaving only two tons. Negotiations are underway, and it is hoped that they can be transported to China. However, the International Red Cross needs to supply approximately one ton of supplies to 66 hospitals every day, so the remaining two tons will not provide much help.

### Ensuring the Safety of Depositors - Banks and Financial Institutions Withdraw Deposit Reserve Funds - Transfer Deposits to Four Local Banks with Appropriate Interest - Only Benefits and No Drawbacks After Implementation

Since the promulgation of the Provisional Measures for the Administration of Banks During Extraordinary Times, the member banks and financial institutions of the Shanghai Banking and Financial Industry Association have complied with the order to set aside one-fifth of the total amount as a reserve fund for ordinary deposits, in addition to setting aside one-quarter of the total amount for savings department deposits in accordance with the Savings Bank Law. These reserves will be transferred to the four local banks: Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China. A reporter from New Voice News learned from the financial sector yesterday that commercial bank deposits in Shanghai have surged since the war, with demand deposits far exceeding time deposits. For example, by the end of the 28th year of the Republic of China, commercial department deposits in Shanghai banks reached over 130 million yuan, with demand deposits accounting for over 70% of the total and time deposits accounting for slightly over 25%. Now, in order to protect depositors, the order to set aside one-fifth of the reserve fund will inevitably cause a slight loss in interest for banks with more time deposits, but there are only benefits and no drawbacks. However, the four banks that receive the reserves will also provide appropriate interest on the reserve funds for each bank. This system has long been implemented in countries like the United Kingdom and the United States. Moreover, the United Kingdom and the United States do not provide interest on reserve funds, while China does, so that those who pay the reserve funds do not suffer from interest losses. After the implementation of these measures, China's wartime financial foundation will become more solid, and depositors will have more confidence in banks after having sufficient protection. Therefore, banks themselves are happy to accept the payment of reserve funds.

### Vegetable and Fruit - Prices Rise - All Subjected to "Market" Control

The prices of vegetables and fruits in this city have risen again in recent days, and the cost of living has also increased accordingly. Half a month ago, the price of green vegetables was one jiao per catty, but now it costs about one jiao and a half. Fruit prices were also significantly lower two-tenths of a half month ago than now. However, small vendors in this city who make a living by wholesaling fruits are no longer able to profit as much as they used to, because vegetables and fruits transported to Shanghai from other areas are now all subject to control. There are currently three "markets" controlling vegetables and fruits in this city: (1) the "Central Market" at the foot of the Xizang Road Bridge, (2) the "Nanshi Branch Market" at the 16th Pier, and (3) the "West District Branch Market" at Caojiadu. Goods transported to Shanghai from various routes must be auctioned through these "markets" regardless of distance. Small vendors must also enter the market to purchase goods wholesale, which has caused great inconvenience to vendors everywhere due to changes in their business practices. The central location of the vegetable market was originally the Laozha Bridge, which was operated by more than 20 local goods firms. Vegetables transported from Suzhou Creek and Pudong were all sold there. However, since the establishment of the "Central Market" and the repeated entry of goods, there is no business to speak of there anymore. Moreover, starting yesterday, fruits transported to Shanghai from Yantai are also controlled and sold by this "market."

### The Medical Community - Public Memorial Service for Pan Ruitang Yesterday

Yesterday, the National Physicians Association, the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, and more than ten other public organizations held a public memorial service at the Ningbo Association for Pan Ruitang, the supervisor of the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association (Assistant Manager of Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory). Hundreds of representatives from various groups attended. Lv Deng, Lu Zhixue, Sun Choucheng, Yuan Hesong, Liu Buqing, Ye Zhisheng, Shi Zhifu, Zhuang Weizhong, and others delivered speeches, all lamenting that Mr. Pan's ambition was unfulfilled and that it was a pity. The funeral procession was magnificent and unprecedented.

### Situation in Eastern Zhejiang is Calm - Detailed Reports Continue to Arrive Regarding the Japanese Planes' Rampage in Ningbo

The Zhejiang provincial groups in Shanghai received the following telegram from Eastern Zhejiang yesterday: (1) At 2:30 PM on the 24th, the sound of planes was heard in the southeast and northeast corners of Yuhuan. Later, a Japanese plane was spotted in the airspace over Wenling. Ningbo issued an air raid warning at 2:45 PM. Five minutes later, the plane passed through Haimen. Ningbo issued an emergency alert again. Then the Japanese plane swept over Fenghua and Ninghai, invaded the airspace over Ningbo, and disappeared out to sea from Cixi. The alert was lifted at 3:17 PM. (2) At 10:45 AM on the 24th, a Japanese warship was spotted on the surface of the Qiancang Ocean, sailing from north to south. Its destination is unknown. In addition, a Japanese warship is anchored outside the Zhenhai Estuary. One Japanese warship is also anchored at Longshan and Sanbei, respectively. As of 7:00 PM, they have not left, but there have been no unusual movements.

(Detailed Information About the Disturbance in Xikou and Ningbo)

(3) The Japanese planes' rampage on the 23rd and the disturbance in Ningbo were reported in a special telegram yesterday. Further details about the Japanese planes' rampage in Ningbo are supplemented as follows: Four Japanese planes were spotted over Guanhaiwei in Hangzhou Bay at 7:45 AM yesterday morning, after which Ningbo issued an air raid warning. The Japanese planes then invaded Zhenhai, and Ningbo issued an emergency alert and implemented traffic control. After a while, the Japanese planes did indeed invade Ningbo. Two planes first entered from the east, followed by two others. They circled over the Jiangdong and Jiangbei districts and flew low over the urban area and the western suburbs for reconnaissance, firing machine guns. The sound of the gunfire was continuous. The Japanese planes then went east via a certain location in the southern suburbs. Another plane hovered over the urban area, flying so low that it was only about 100 feet above the ground, almost colliding with the houses. The Japanese planes also opened fire with machine guns in Jiangdong. After the incident, it was found that the Japanese planes had dropped two hand grenades in a certain location on Wangchun Bridge in the western suburbs, injuring one civilian. In Jiangdong, a farmer was injured by shrapnel on Baihe Bridge. In addition, five or six other people were injured by machine gun fire and sought treatment at the hospital on their own. Their names are unknown. The Japanese planes dropped airburst bombs in Ningbo. A shell casing, the size of an electric light bulb, was found on the open space in front of the county government office and is now under investigation. According to reports from Lishshe, when the Japanese planes swept over, they chased farmers, and one person was injured and fell to the ground. The leg was wounded by shrapnel. After seeking treatment at the hospital, the bullets have all been removed. In addition, Japanese planes also passed over Liyan in western Yin, and leaflets were scattered.

### Ships of British and French Companies - Left Shanghai for Haiphong Yesterday - Shandong and Xijiang Ships Carry Cargo - Hana and Gordon Ships Sailed Safely Along the Coast of Zhejiang - Xin'anna to Sail to Fuqing Tomorrow, Still Unresolved

There have been rumors in recent days that Japan will take action against Vietnam. Furthermore, the postponement of the departure of the Yiyou ship of the Taikoo Company and the postponement of the voyage of the Xijiang (transliteration) of the French Postal Shipping Company to Haiphong have drawn great attention from the people of Shanghai. However, this news is not accurate. According to a New Voice News reporter's inquiry, the ships of the British and French companies left Shanghai for Haiphong yesterday. The Shandong ship of the Taikoo Company left port at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. The Xijiang of the French Postal Shipping Company followed the Shandong ship at 11:00 AM, sailing south directly to Haiphong. Both ships carried a portion of cargo in addition to passengers. The Mingsheng ship of Jardine Matheson Shipping Company is scheduled to depart for Vietnam on the 28th. The Taisheng ship will leave Haiphong and return here on September 1, and will continue to sail to Haiphong on the 3rd. The Qingyuan ship of the Taikoo Company is also scheduled to set sail with the Mingsheng ship on the 28th.

(Dispute over Freight Charges for Xin'anna)

The British-owned Fusheng Company's Xin'anna ship was originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Fuqing in Fujian Province as usual tomorrow, loaded with passengers and cargo. However, because the dispute between the company and the Fujianese merchants regarding freight charges has not been resolved, the ship may postpone its departure. Regarding the freight charge dispute, the company authorities told a reporter from Pingming News yesterday that the company's doubling of the freight charges for goods transported to Fujian is only a temporary measure because the cargo capacity of Fuqing's warehouses is limited, with a maximum capacity of only 400 tons. Therefore, the company had no choice but to increase the freight charges in order to limit the cargo volume. However, when the reporter inquired with the Fujian Fellow-Villagers Association, they said that the leaders of the Fujianese merchants had notified all Fujianese merchants based on the decision made the day before that all goods shipped to Fujian on the Xin'anna ship would be calculated according to the original freight charges and that private transactions were not allowed. Otherwise, once discovered, the association would impose severe penalties, with a very firm attitude. As for the victims of the robbery of the Shenhua ship of the Yilong Company, a meeting was held the afternoon before yesterday to discuss the matter and representatives were appointed to negotiate with the Yilong Company. According to the reporter, the demands of the passengers on the Chinese ship that was robbed were submitted to the Yilong Company last Saturday, and the company's reply is scheduled to be sent out today. In addition, representatives of the Fujianese merchants in Shanghai will also go to the company for negotiations today or tomorrow.

(Hana and Gordon Sailed Safely)

Since the Dashin ship sailed into Aojiang, it is still unloading cargo. The German-owned Far East Company's Hana ship, seeing the success of the Dashin ship's voyage to Aojiang, also set sail from Shanghai for Aojiang at 5:00 PM on the 24th (of this month). If there are no obstacles, it should arrive in Aojiang this morning. The company received a telegram from the ship's captain from the Panmen Sea yesterday afternoon, reporting that they had not encountered any Japanese warships along the way, so the voyage was very safe. The German-owned Lulin Shipping Company's Gordon ship set sail for Songmen at 5:30 PM on the 24th (of this month). The ship was carrying more than 100 passengers. Yesterday, the ship's captain reported to Shanghai via wireless that the journey was very safe and that it would arrive in Songmen in the evening. Shanghai is waiting for the ship's telegram to confirm whether it can dock and unload cargo. The ship also plans to visit other ports such as Wannan, Tian, Juexi, and Jinqing. If it can sail without obstruction, it will operate on this route regularly in the future. The German-owned Haiyi ship is also scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Songmen, Xiushan, and Qushan on the 27th. The ship is currently completing customs clearance procedures and will be carrying passengers in addition to cargo. The Lima ship will continue to travel between Shanghai and Cengang, and its voyages are still smooth. However, the Anli ship has temporarily suspended operations, and there is no news of resumption of service after the Mofu ship unloads its cargo.

### Police Arrest Thief on Fulu Li Road - One Thief Shot

At 8:45 PM last night, two robbers suddenly broke into the Shanghai Xinji Coal Company at 543 Avenue Albert in the French Concession. Both robbers drew handguns and threatened to silence anyone. They robbed more than 200 yuan in French currency and fled with their loot. At the time, an employee of the company followed them, shouting "Catch the thieves!" Nearby Chinese police officers, hearing the alarm, also gave chase. The robbers fled to the vicinity of Fulu Li Road and opened fire to resist arrest. The Chinese police officers also drew their guns and returned fire. Six or seven shots were fired on both sides. One robber was shot in the shoulder, fell to the ground, and was arrested. A handgun and part of the stolen money were found on him. Two other suspects were also arrested and taken to the police station for investigation.

### Young Man Found Strangled in the Great China Hotel - Strangled with Hemp Rope, Mouth Stuffed with Cotton Wool - Strange Circumstances, Perpetrator Escaped Without a Trace

Yesterday morning, a tragic case of a man being strangled occurred in Room 528 of the Great China Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. The deceased was a young man, about 20 years old. The circumstances are mysterious and bizarre. The following details were obtained from investigations:

(Young Man Books Room)

At about 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, two young travelers suddenly arrived at the Great China Hotel at the corner of Yu Qiaqing Road and Fuzhou Road. One was wearing a striped suit and shirt, white shorts, patterned socks, and yellow leather shoes. The other was wearing a shirt, white western-style shorts, and white leather shoes. Both were around 22 or 23 years old. They went straight to the fifth floor and asked the reception desk if there were any rooms available. They were led to Room 528, which cost $6.44 per day. The young men filled out the registration form as Li Ming, 21 years old, local, merchant. They paid $20 in national currency on the spot. After the waiter served tea, he politely left.

(High Spirits)

Not long after the two travelers entered the room, they ordered 20 cigarettes, a bottle of soda, and two "Snow White" popsicles from the waiter. They stayed in the room for about half an hour and then went out together, returning to the hotel at dusk. They sang loudly and were unusually happy. After a while, they had dinner. Around 9:00 PM, three more people arrived, two wearing long gowns and one wearing short clothes. They ordered four bottles of Shanghai beer and two bottles of soda. They drank until about 10:30 PM, when they were drunk and in high spirits. They ordered two more bottles of beer and some good food to go with the drinks. The sound of their revelry reached outside the door. As the night wore on and their fun came to an end, the waiter entered the room, wiped and cleaned it once, and then closed the door tightly. The waiters at the reception desk did not pay attention to the movements of the people inside the room.

(Body Discovered)

At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the day shift waiter, No. 46, noticed that the door of Room 528 was half-open. He peered inside and found that the room was silent, which aroused his suspicion. He opened the door and entered. The first thing he saw was a pair of yellow leather shoes left next to the dressing table. Then he discovered a body lying under the bed, with a thick hemp rope around its throat and heavy cotton wool stuffed in its mouth. The waiter quickly ran out, told his colleagues, and reported to the accounting office. They reported to the Laozha Police Station by telephone and ordered Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene for investigation. After an investigation, the body was taken to the morgue for examination in a hearse. All the waiters at the reception desk were taken to the police station for questioning in detail in order to track down the perpetrator and bring him to justice. The circumstances of this case are bizarre and mysterious. Whether it was a revenge killing or a love affair, the police are currently investigating.

### Datong Textile Factory in Chongming - Destroyed by Guerrillas

According to visitors from Chongming yesterday, the Datong Textile Factory, which is operated by the Japanese and contains military equipment storage, was discovered by Chinese guerrillas. They secretly dispatched more than ten team members to sneak in from the outer ditch of the factory and reached the machine room and storage room after passing through a tortuous underground passage of more than ten zhang. They then used explosives to completely destroy the place and left calmly. By the time the Japanese troops arrived after hearing the alarm, they could not find any traces of them.

### After Shen Jiucheng Was Kidnapped - Strange Phone Call Received - Instructing to Claim Car - Result Still No Trace

According to Hwa Kwong News Agency, Shen Jiucheng, the manager of Sheng Sheng Ranch on Daxilu Road, a native of Hangzhou, was kidnapped by bandits along with his own car number 3735 in front of his residence in Youyicun, Columbia Road, the day before yesterday. The driver, Ying Zhonghui, was driven off and reported to Shen's family, who reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station for investigation. That night, at about 9:00 PM, the Shen residence suddenly received a strange phone call. The other party claimed to be the "Police Station" on Daxilu Road and said that Shen's own car number 3735 had been found at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Jessfield Road and instructed them to claim it immediately. Shen's family ordered the driver, Ying Zhonghui, to rush to the address, but after searching extensively in the vicinity, there was no trace of the car. Therefore, they felt that the source of the phone call was very strange. As for Shen's whereabouts, there is still no information. The Jing'an Temple Police Station is currently trying to rescue him.

### Number of Patients Attending Emergency Relief Hospital for Epidemics Increases Sharply

The number of outpatients and inpatients at the Shanghai Emergency Relief Hospital for Epidemics, which is sponsored by the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association at 730 Nüjianshi Road, has increased sharply in recent days. According to Dr. Tong Zhiqing, director of medical affairs at the hospital, the number of outpatients has recently reached 600 to 700 per day due to the unfavorable weather and the prevalence of seasonal diseases. In order to facilitate diagnosis and treatment and save time, internal medicine and surgery have been divided into two departments for diagnosis and treatment. Even so, it is still not possible to complete the diagnosis and treatment within the specified time. Most of the patients suffer from gastroenteritis, dysentery, colds, and other diseases. However, there are many cases similar to cholera. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department has confirmed that there are 19 cases of true cholera. The patients have all been cured and discharged from the hospital one after another and are grateful for the hospital's quick treatment and thoughtful service. They are extremely inspired. It is reported that the hospital has 200 beds. Whether for inpatients or outpatients, serum injections and other medical supplies of great value are not charged, making it the only charitable hospital for the poor and sick.

### Industrial and Commercial Service Center to be Established

The Industrial and Commercial Service Center was founded by Xu Wancheng and will be officially established at the beginning of next month. Its purpose is to draft factory names and product names for the industrial and commercial community, select and create trademarks, design advertisements, write instruction manuals, translate documents, recruit employees, promote products, etc. The address is Room 4, 3rd Floor, Yanye Building, Beijing Road.

Compared to the same day in previous years, it was 95.2 degrees high and 76.1 degrees low.

### Public Concession Patrol Car - Intercepted Arms Trafficker - Seized Two Hand Grenades and Bullets

The Public Concession Police Department is now paying more attention to the defense of the western district. Recently, reserve teams have been sent in red patrol cars to patrol the roads to supplement the patrols. At around 8:00 AM yesterday, the patrol car was patrolling the area of Xiaoshadu Road and Avenue Haig in western Shanghai when it noticed a pedestrian who looked suspicious. They immediately ordered him to stop and searched him. As a result, they found two small bombs and many handgun bullets on the pedestrian. The witness was also taken to the police station, and the investigation is currently underway.

### Pitiable Old Woman in Her Later Years - Daughters-in-Law and Grandson Privately Distribute Property - Files Lawsuit Requesting Redistribution of Property - Official Orders Both Parties to Settle Out of Court

Zhang Ou, a local old woman living at 31 Continental Lane, Luban Road, is 76 years old this year. Mrs. Ou was unfortunately widowed in middle age, leaving behind a son named Bingxin. Mrs. Ou raised him through hardship and raised him to adulthood. He engaged in the jewelry business. Zhang Bingxin accumulated tens of thousands of dollars due to his successful business. He was very filial to his mother. Mrs. Ou was old and was very pleased because her son was filial. However, because Zhang Bingxin's first wife did not have any children, he

adopted a son

named Zhang Haoqiu (now an adult and living at 20 Lane 307, Yunnan Road). Because he was not his own, he was ultimately dissatisfied. Therefore, he took Qin and Dai as concubines. Qin also did not have any children. Dai had a daughter named Zhang Hao Yu, who is still young. In the winter of 1937, after Zhang Bingxin died of illness, Zhang Haoqiu, Qin, Dai, and others treated the elderly Mrs. Ou as if she were a stranger. They took the opportunity to take all of Zhang Bingxin's property on December 31, 1938, and

distribute it privately

Only 10% of her wealth was offered to the mother, including worthless IOUs, abandoned houses in remote and uninhabited Huining Road, and the grave of Zhang Bingxin's deceased first wife, etc., as Mrs. Ou's living expenses. Mrs. Ou often recalled raising her son to adulthood, hoping to have someone to rely on for the rest of her life, but after her son died, her inheritance was privately distributed by non-blood relatives Zhang Haoqiu, Qin, Dai, and others. She could not help but shed tears often. Mrs. Ou was old and feeble, and

faced financial difficulties

Therefore, she was forced to recently hire lawyers Ge Zhizheng and Sun Deji to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court's Civil Court, accusing Zhang Qin, Zhang Dai, Zhang Haoqiu, etc., requesting that the court rule that the defendants' private distribution of Zhang Bingxin's inheritance was invalid and order the defendants to jointly pay the plaintiff (1) National currency of 14,689 yuan for living expenses (calculated as 20% of the total estimated inheritance as a lifetime living expense, excluding the 10% received). (2) National currency of 780 yuan for prepaid interest (3) National currency of 2,584 yuan for rent, wardrobes, etc. (4)

Grave Valuation

870 yuan (5) A portion of Zhang Hao Yu's marriage education expenses that was withdrawn without authorization, calculated at 20%, and returned National currency of 1,700 yuan. Regarding Zhang Haoqiu's personal share, calculated at 30% of the distribution, 15,420 yuan in national currency should be paid to the plaintiff. The case was recently heard by Judge Tao in the Civil Court. The defendants Zhang Dai and others hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to appear in court and requested that the court reject the plaintiff's lawsuit. The court gently advised both parties for a long time, saying that the case involved family matters and that it would be best for the defendant to give the plaintiff some living expenses to reach a settlement.

### Shanghai Open Swimming Championships Create Two New Records: Women's 100-Yard Freestyle and Men's 150-Yard Backstroke

The second Shanghai Open Swimming Championships, including the men's 50-yard freestyle, 100-yard breaststroke, 150-yard backstroke, and women's 100-yard freestyle, were held at the French Club swimming pool on Jufu Road the day before yesterday. Wu Jiahua, Wang Zhongren, and Miss Lin Meiling won second place respectively. In the men's 50-yard freestyle, the famous general Wen Jingling originally had absolute certainty of winning, but he performed abnormally last night, finishing in fifth place with a time of 25.2 seconds, which was worse than his equality Shanghai record in the preliminary round. In the 100-yard breaststroke, the champion, G. Grivboff, had an average performance, and Wu Jiahua finished in second place by a slight margin, which was a pity. In the 150-yard backstroke, Lun Sitai broke his own Shanghai record of 1 minute 50.2 seconds from last year with an excellent time of 1 minute 48 seconds. Wang Zhongren fought for second place. Wang, originally named Zhongcheng, was previously a representative of Shanghai. In the women's 100-yard freestyle, Miss M. Tamoore broke Miss Lin Meiling's Shanghai record of 71 seconds from last year with an excellent time of 69 seconds.

### Another Suggestion for a Basketball Challenge Match: A Mixed Team Is Unlikely to Cooperate, Advocates for Shanghai, Qingdao, and Other Teams to Play

The charitable basketball challenge match has attracted much attention. Yesterday, we received letters from two readers, Gao and Huang, who do not advocate a mixed team to compete with Paramount, believing that a hastily formed army is unlikely to cooperate, which is insightful. They also suggested that the Shanghai, Qingdao, Liangxi, and Youlian teams should strengthen their lineups and compete with Paramount again. The letters are recorded below. We hope that Shanghai, Qingdao, Liangxi, and Youlian will respond to this.

Dear Sir, Zhang Hongsheng and Sun Qihuang have successively suggested in your newspaper that a mixed team of all Shanghai talents should be organized to compete with Paramount again to determine the real league champion and to generate more ticket revenue for charity. Paramount can also accept the challenge. It seems that in the near future, the fans in the isolated island can feast their eyes. However, there are three reasons why readers cannot remain silent. First, a charity match is a charitable undertaking, and all city teams should do their best to support and participate in it. The main purpose of the match is to perform, but to use it to determine the league champion goes against the spirit of the charity match. Second, a mixed team is formed hastily, and although all the talents are gathered, practice and time are essential. If the cooperation between them is not well-established, the result will inevitably follow the failure of the Xihua United team last time. Third, in order to pursue a wonderful performance to impress the audience, why not invite strong city teams such as Shanghai, Qingdao, Liangxi, and Youlian to perform again with Paramount, each giving their best, which is more interesting. I hope that your newspaper, which is enthusiastic about supporting sports, will grant us a corner to publish this suggestion, which I believe will be welcomed by sports colleagues, the Nankai Academy, and enthusiastic individuals.

Respectfully, Gao Shuying, August 24th. Dear Sir, I have been reading your newspaper for the past few days and am delighted to learn that the charity basketball match promoted by all parties is gradually taking shape. I am sincerely pleased, and I also admire Paramount and Chuanlian's enthusiasm for sponsoring the event. However, in my humble opinion, I believe that the union of a mixed team is not only difficult in terms of personnel selection, but also a hastily formed army is like a plate of loose sand. After all, the players come from different teams and have few opportunities to practice. Once they fight on the court, they will inevitably act independently and have no cooperation. For example, the Shanghai-Qingdao team in the Zongheng-Zhongqing basketball game, when Shen Yugong and other famous players from Hualian joined, their strength was not as strong as before. From this, it can be seen that a mixed army is not reliable. Therefore, the mixed team will undoubtedly be defeated when playing against Paramount. In my opinion, it is better to invite two or three strong teams, strengthen their lineups, and compete with Paramount in a single round-robin system to determine the Shanghai league champion, which is more appropriate and meaningful. I hope you will correct my ignorant views. Huang Zhixiang, August 25th.

### The Fate of the Pound Sterling: Does it Depend on Britain's Ability to Sustain a Protracted War? Can Britain Sustain a Protracted War? How Will Changes in the Fate of the Pound Affect International Finance? Will the Victory or Defeat of the Allied Forces Affect the Post-War World Monetary System? Will the Position of Gold in Currency Change After the War?

Wang Xiao: Whether Britain Can Sustain a Protracted War—The Victory or Defeat of the Allied Forces (In reality, only Britain remains) - This is a question that needs to be answered by comparing the strength of the belligerent parties - including military, economic, diplomatic, etc.

Today, the most significant difficulty facing Britain, Germany, and Italy is clearly not a military problem. Why? Because in military terms, they can be considered evenly matched. Britain can rely on its powerful navy to protect the British Isles and some colonies. Germany and Italy can rely on their superior air force and a portion of their army to protect their own territories without fear. So, what is the main difficulty? This is:

(1) The Economic Problem: There is no doubt that Britain's total mobilization today has not been as smooth as it was in 1914. As everyone knows, Britain's life is built on the foundation of its colonies. But today, centrifugal forces are developing in the colonies: Canada, being too far away, has actually leaned towards the United States; the independence and liberation movement in India is the biggest headache for Britain; Australia's ambiguous attitude (according to some foreign newspapers, the semi-fascist Australian Lyons government has a tacit understanding with Germany, Italy, especially Japan) is also making it difficult... These are all difficulties in economic mobilization.

What about Germany and Italy? Regardless of whether Germany bloodlessly gained Austria and Czechoslovakia, and later gained Poland, Norway, Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, and France, the economic problem has not been solved. In particular, the shortage of food may become its fatal wound. Italy is the same. Gaining Abyssinia was originally a joke of trying to steal a chicken and losing the rice, and the food panic is also quite serious. For example, the year before last, it had to bite the bullet and buy wheat from the Soviet Union (because the Soviet Union repeatedly criticized Italy's propaganda of famine in the Soviet Union, so at that time it requested that all national newspapers publish the news that Italy bought wheat from the Soviet Union as one of the conditions), and recently signed commercial agreements with the Soviet Union, etc.

To this day, on the economic front, Britain can still strengthen a portion of its potential and surpass Germany and Italy (for example, sufficient food).

(2) The Problem of Allied Nations and Revolution: From September last year to March this year, the characteristic of the European war was manifested in economic warfare and diplomatic warfare. The economic problem has already been discussed somewhat. Diplomatic warfare is clearly a war to win over allied nations.

In diplomatic warfare, Britain has indeed suffered a lot from "blitz tactics," and watched helplessly as Norway, Holland, etc., were incorporated into Germany's territory. But this cannot be said that Germany has completely won. Today, diplomatic warfare is still unfolding fiercely, which is manifested in the following aspects: First, winning over small countries, including several countries in the Balkan Peninsula, as well as Portugal in the Iberian Peninsula, etc., but in this regard, the achievements of both sides are very few. The main reason is that the small countries see the actual situation, so they are unwilling to serve as cannon fodder. Countries like Turkey and Bulgaria... have strengthened their ties with the Soviet Union. Second, winning over Japan. Germany and Italy's wish is to make Japan contain Britain and contain the United States to reduce its assistance to Britain. Britain's wish is, of course, the opposite, to win over Japan to contain Germany and Italy, and to weaken the contradictions between Japan and the United States so that the United States can calmly assist Britain. But the achievements in this regard clearly cannot determine the outcome of the war. Why? First, Japan has been depleted after three years of war, and is obviously exhausted. Second, the expansion of US armaments, rather than helping Britain, is more closely related to using the current volatile world situation to achieve its desires. Third, winning over the Soviet Union. This is clearly impossible. But today, Britain, Germany, and Italy all want to get some replenishment economically, so they frequently send signals to the Soviet Union. But Molotov, in his foreign policy report at the Supreme Soviet meeting, was clearly unmoved.

Therefore, the future of diplomatic warfare is quite bleak.

The problem of revolution is clearly the most threatening thing for both sides. In the First World War, a Soviet Union was born, then today, after twenty years, especially the suffering that war brings to the people, so the possibility of revolution is very high.

So, can Britain ultimately win or not? I cannot give a definite answer. Based on the above analysis, I would like to draw the following conclusions:

The European war will continue and expand, but it will be military in form and economic in its essence; and the prolongation of the war may cause the outbreak of revolution.

The fate of the pound sterling is tied to the fate of the British economy, which is inevitable. Since the outbreak of the European war, due to the considerable exodus of London funds, and the decline in foreign trade... the global role of the pound sterling has been gradually weakening. (This can also be seen from Japan's departure from the pound sterling linkage last year.) On the other hand, the United States' surplus of gold has a tendency to restore its silver purchase policy, which has also considerably hit the pound sterling. The Soviet Union's increasingly active business relations with various countries will also relatively limit the role of the pound sterling. Looking at China, in the past year, it has simply become unfamiliar with the pound sterling. Therefore, these indicate that if the war continues, then the fate of the pound sterling will become problematic. As for what kind of changes will occur in international finance after the fate of the pound sterling becomes problematic, I don't think there will be any major stimulus. Just speaking from China, judging from the current domestic economic construction, creating an independent currency system is quite possible.

Regarding the question of whether the victory or defeat of the Allied forces can affect the post-war monetary system, I think what needs to be clarified first is what kind of post-war it is, that is to say, is it the post-war like after the First World War! Or a new post-war? Second, which direction is the economic trend at that time heading? And the monetary system issue is clearly still one of the economic issues. As for the question of whether the position of gold in currency will change after the war, I can say with certainty that under any circumstances, it will not change in the near future, because it has gone through thousands of years of selection by mankind and ensures that it has its monetary characteristics.

Shen Hongfan: In countries with a currency management system, the value of the currency does not depend on the amount of gold reserves, but on the people's faith and the country's resource base. If this view can be established, then the fate of the pound sterling certainly depends on whether Britain can sustain a protracted war. Britain's decision to fight alone regardless of France's surrender was by no means made casually, but was made after the cabinet had thoroughly analyzed the potential of Britain and Germany, and felt that China's vast colonial resources, plus the assistance of the United States, could indeed sustain a protracted war. So the value of the free pound in New York is gradually approaching the official exchange rate. Although this seems to be the effect of the elimination of the free pound, it is still a major reason for the world's confidence in the pound caused by Britain's ability to fight a protracted war. The new pound sterling control regulations were announced on July 18, and it was only recently that the New York pound sterling black market approached the official exchange rate, so it can be known that this was caused by the results of the Anglo-German air war, which proved the strong foundation of Britain's potential.

Before the European war, the pound sterling was the world's authoritative currency, and the pound sterling bloc was stronger than the US dollar bloc before the war. After the outbreak of the war, the devaluation of the pound sterling prompted various countries to withdraw from the pound sterling bloc. Therefore, except for the currencies of British colonies and dominions that are still linked to the pound sterling, other countries have all formally or informally broken away from the link with the pound sterling. Even China's legal tender is no longer a member of the pound sterling bloc in fact. Therefore, the change in the fate of the pound sterling does not seem to have a big impact on the currencies of various countries now. Britain has the second largest amount of foreign investment in the world, and most of its foreign credit is in the pound sterling bloc countries, so there is no impact if the pound sterling depreciates. As for the credit of various countries in Britain, it has also been gradually withdrawn after the outbreak of the war, so there is no problem. Therefore, the change in the fate of the pound sterling will not cause any major changes in international finance.

As for the impact of the victory or defeat of the Allied forces on the post-war monetary system, if the Allied forces can win, then the post-war monetary system will not change much. On the contrary, if Germany and Italy gain control of Europe, then the multilateral foreign exchange clearing system may be implemented in Europe, the currency will be separated from gold, and it will be used domestically based on national credit; while the payment of international loans and borrowings will be settled purely by clearing, without using gold and foreign exchange. However, the payment between Europe and other countries in the world may still not be able to break away from gold, because although gold has various shortcomings, such as excessive concentration in the United States, insufficient production, etc., there is nothing that can replace it. Therefore, the position of gold in the post-war monetary system is that there is no possibility of restoring the gold standard domestically, and it is also the only item for final payment internationally, which is exactly the same as the function of gold today.

Yu Zhang: First of all, I feel that it is difficult to speculate on who will ultimately win in the current stage of the European imperialist war, which is gradually becoming a fierce hand-to-hand combat! This is not only because the changes in international relations are often in an instant; especially because the internal political and economic structure of the countries engaged in the war may determine their final war situation.

But if we observe based on the current situation, Germany and Italy's battle results in places such as France, Belgium, Holland, and Norway, of course, guarantee the continuation of today's war with Britain, and at the same time have considerable sharpness; but Britain, due to the abundance of internal strength, and the fact that the navy and air force still maintain considerable advantages, it is obvious that the war situation will not be resolved in a few weeks as Germany predicted! Especially with the all-out assistance of the United States, and the support of vast colonial areas (such as Canada, India, etc.), Britain's protracted war has its greatest possibility.

As for the fate of the pound sterling, it depends on the victory or defeat of Britain in the war, which is beyond doubt! Today, the ratio between the price of the pound sterling and the US dollar is worse than before the European war (before the war, one pound sterling was about 4.02 US dollars, and now it is only worth about 3.50 US dollars, a decrease of more than one-tenth), which just illustrates the impact of the war on the pound sterling; although due to its vast colonies all over the world, and the economic lifeline of many semi-colonial countries controlled by the British Empire, its power is originally not weaker than the US dollar (let alone the fascist Nazi economic group), but in the event that Britain suffers a disastrous defeat in the war, the commercial and financial blows suffered by some countries (colonies and semi-colonies) that are trapped in the pound sterling bloc are self-evident: at the same time, following the shift of the political situation, a reform and change will inevitably occur in the international financial (including monetary) system. (Although not the whole world).

Therefore, some people believe that the position of gold after the war will also undergo extraordinary changes. As evidenced by the "Gold Table Theory" issued by Dr. Winschuh, an economic writer of the German General Report some time ago, and the words of German Minister of Economy Fink that "Europe will not be based on gold in future currency policies," it seems that gold will be worthless after the war, as if it is already under control.

In fact, the essence of this European war is a war of infighting between imperialists, so the consistent economic system of capitalism will not be changed or shifted as a result, whether Britain wins and Germany loses, or Germany wins and Britain loses, or even maintains the status quo, is expected! Then, it means that the world's exchange economic system will not be reduced - that is, no matter whether Britain, Germany, Italy... cannot break away from the scope of commercial exchange after the war one day, then gold will ultimately maintain its monetary base value one day, which is undoubtedly a matter! Although the gold at this time is no longer shared by all countries, and has formed a "biased" phenomenon due to the war (such as the United States); but that does not hinder the circulation of the value of gold itself! On the contrary, due to the opposite changes between the price of gold and the price of commodities, for example, the recovery of commodity production after the war will affect the decline in prices, and on the other hand, it will further promote the rise in the price of gold.

Hu Longchang: In this 20th century era of prevalent psychological warfare tactics, the strength or weakness of a country's international prestige is often enough to influence foreigners' belief in its currency credit; the frequent decline of the pound sterling in the New York market in recent months, on the one hand, is certainly due to the implementation of Britain's new foreign exchange regulations, but the successive defeats of the Allied forces on the European continent cannot be disassociated as a powerful factor. The direct result has promoted the separation of Scandinavian countries, Japan, and Portugal from the pound sterling. Therefore, there are two factors that determine the fate of the pound sterling: one is to continue its consistent strategy of protracted war, using its superior economic strength to fight a war of attrition against totalitarianism; and the other is to strictly implement the foreign exchange regulations to eliminate the gap between the official price and the free exchange rate of the pound sterling. Whether Britain can sustain a protracted war, this question can be observed from several aspects: First, in terms of military strength, although it has lost France, its air force and navy strength are still considerable, and what's more, there are colonies as its manpower backing; Second: Britain is able to use its already occupied advantage economically to deal with the blitzkrieg with a protracted war, giving play to the effect of its economic blockade and attrition warfare; As for the raising of Britain's wartime resources, under the implementation of its policies such as increasing taxes, issuing debt bonds, forcing preparations, and selling gold, as well as the assistance of the United States, it is not a problem. In terms of diplomacy, the issue of obtaining naval cooperation from Japan is still in a state of competition with totalitarian countries, and it is not yet possible to talk about the impact on the protracted war. If the fate of the pound sterling changes, then international finance, which originally used the gold and pound sterling as a payment medium, will be rapidly reduced; the US dollar will accelerate its acquisition of general faith after the war, and the revision of the US banking law for more than ten years, and the elimination of old financial market problems, can enable New York to replace London's position as an international financial center.

If the Allied forces win, then there will be no significant fluctuations in the post-war monetary system; if the Allied forces lose, then under the totalitarian's intention to destroy the British and American economic bloc, there will be considerable changes; as for the question of whether gold will maintain its original position in currency after the war, it also depends on the key to the success or failure of the gold agreement between the United States, which has an excessive amount of gold reserves, and various countries after the war. If there is hope of success, then the United States should, in order to maintain the entire international financial and trade mechanism, not hesitate to lose to properly redistribute the existing gold reserves, and on the other hand, reduce the price of gold and encourage import surpluses, then there may still be a possibility of returning to a permanent gold standard internationally: otherwise, under the totalitarian's international barter system, or other measures to deprive the relationship between gold and currency, international finance will become a poorly conceived segregated situation, and currency may undergo a major revolution in history.

Huang Bingzhang: The victory or defeat of the Allied forces may fundamentally change the world's monetary system. Today's world economy is undeniably manipulated by British and American gold. Therefore, the monetary systems of various countries are directly or indirectly linked to Britain and the United States. However, since 1929, many countries have abandoned the gold standard due to the world panic, coupled with the drastic changes in gold distribution, then the position of gold in currency has been slightly lower than before. Moreover, the totalitarian countries such as Germany, Italy, and Japan are all countries with anemia in gold, and the Soviet Union and Germany allow to despise the effect of gold on currency, so if the Allied forces lose this war, the position of gold in the economic structure will be greatly reduced, or even completely overthrown.

Du Yun: The fate of the gold pound may not depend on Britain's ability to sustain a protracted war - in other words, even if Britain loses the war, it will only cause the collapse of Great Britain, and each colony will be free and independent, still using the gold pound. Britain may implement a protracted war because of its wide range of overseas colonies and its innate richness. The pound sterling will eventually depreciate, but it is only a matter of time. International finance will turn out to be better as a result of the depreciation of the gold pound.

Xiao Feng: The victory or defeat of the Allied forces will partially affect the post-war monetary system of the world, especially the colonies of Britain and France.

The position of gold in currency will not fundamentally change. Generally speaking, when the capitalist system exists, the position of gold in currency will not decline, but because of the excessive concentration of gold, it has relatively weakened its currency circulation effect.

Du Zhihao: It is very difficult for Britain itself to fight a protracted war, but because of the active assistance of the United States (military and economic), or the improvement of relations with the Soviet Union (if possible), its sustainability will be increased. The long-awaited German attack on Britain has been delayed because the Soviet Union is expanding into the Balkans; the situation in Southeast Europe has not been clarified for a while, so Germany does not dare to rashly start its war to determine the outcome immediately. Of course, the fate of the pound sterling will depend on Britain's ability to sustain a protracted war? That is, the victory or defeat of Britain. Extending it: The victory or defeat of the Allied forces (the United States participates in the war) will certainly also affect the entire world's monetary system. If the Allied forces win, undoubtedly, the existing world monetary system will still be maintained, based on gold, and the possible change is only the change in the value of gold. On the contrary, the position of gold in the monetary system will be fundamentally shaken. The "Gold Table Theory" of German General Report writer Winschuh and the "Clearing System" of German Minister of Economy Fink both believe that gold will be useless after the war in the future, and are heading towards the path of the clearing system. At that time, the world's finance will be centered on the currency policy of the Axis powers. In between the two, if the war progresses to the point of "both sides being hurt," and a "world revolution" occurs, the shaking of the position of gold will be even more unspeakable.

### What is the Impact of the Linkage of the European and Asian War Situations on the Economic World (Continued)

Zhang Dajiang: The fate of the pound sterling does not necessarily depend narrowly on whether Britain can sustain a protracted war, but the victory or defeat of Britain can at least determine its fate. Again, can Britain sustain a protracted war? According to my observation of Britain's current situation, there are still countless self-governing colonies that can be used for a protracted war. It cannot be said to be defeated immediately after Britain's headquarters is invaded, but only by land and air. Britain still possesses a powerful fleet, and the fleet is by no means something that can be eliminated in one fell swoop. Furthermore, after the fate of the pound sterling changes, international finance, especially the pound sterling bloc countries, will be affected by chaos, which may cause currency inflation in most countries.

Liu Chengyan: In this war, if the Allied forces win, it can be predicted that the world's monetary system will continue to maintain its existing basic state; on the contrary, if the Allied forces are defeated, then the reform of the new monetary system in the single world will inevitably appear along with the creation of the so-called "New European Order." At that time, the main position of gold in the world's currency will lose its original importance due to being forcibly deprived.

Du Yun: Under the linked situation, it is more convenient to use legal tender. Under the individual situation, it will expand barter trade. If the Chinese economic community wants to adapt to the environment, it is naturally best to strive to transfer funds internally to facilitate national use, and as a result, the country and the people will benefit together.

Zhang Yumei: In the linked situation, the main thing is to see what the degree of linkage is? Whether it will be more advanced or more sparse than it is now? Under the linked situation, the main European countries can not only make their vested economic interests in China more stable, but also provide various trade conveniences to the new China after the completion of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. Under the individual action, the situation will be exactly the opposite; as for the emerging Germany, it currently has no special position in China, and the future trend and the relationship it can have with China are extremely subtle. Under different situations, the Chinese economic community has no component of dependence on other countries, and there will be no need to worry about it in the future.

### Jin Shurong's Commentary

— Sheng Kaiqiong

—August 24th—

(1) Ban on the Import of British Banknotes

The British Embassy officially issued a statement on the 22nd, declaring a ban on the import of Bank of England banknotes into Britain. However, to protect the interests of banknote holders, the following four measures are specified: (1) Bank of England banknotes delivered to banks in China before business hours on August 27th will be credited to the bank's account upon receipt in the UK; (2) Banknotes sent from China to the UK en route may be accepted; (3) Any banknotes sent out are the responsibility of the sender for any risks; (4) Banknotes sent out not in accordance with these conditions will not be collected in the UK. In addition, there are two important points in the text: firstly, the banks must be legitimate and publicly recognized; British banknotes sent by private individuals or any institutions will not be credited in the UK. Secondly, normal foreign exchange transactions handled by banks are not restricted by this regulation.

Britain has always been the financial center of the world, and because its territories are spread across continents, a large number of Bank of England banknotes circulate in various countries. Since the outbreak of the European War, Britain has successively implemented strict controls on foreign exchange. On July 18th, it cooperated with the United States to crack down on the existence of free sterling. However, now that Germany has defeated France, its power extends throughout Europe. Even in the Far East, the Dutch East Indies and French Indochina have become pro-German due to the surrender of their sovereign states. To prevent Germany from obtaining Bank of England banknotes from the occupied areas through neutral countries to obtain British foreign exchange funds, Britain has had to prohibit the import of Bank of England banknotes that have already circulated abroad. The statement claims that the implementation of this measure must be short and that the exchange period cannot be extended, which shows the attention and strict enforcement of the British authorities.

Because normal exchange rates are not restricted by this method, the free pound in Shanghai is stable at US$3.62, and the exchange rate of legal tender to the pound has not been affected, remaining at 3.703125 pence. However, in the foreign currency market, the price of pound notes has fallen sharply. Normally, due to interest, freight, and insurance costs, the value of pound notes is always smaller than the exchange rate value. For example, from the 1st to the 21st of this month, the value of pound notes fluctuated between 57 and 59 yuan, while the exchange rate value of the pound fluctuated between 62 and 65 yuan. The difference between the closing prices was only about 6.7 yuan. On the 22nd and 23rd, the exchange rate of the pound did not change, but the price of pound notes fell from 58.5 yuan to 52.5 yuan. The difference between the price of notes and the exchange rate increased from 6.31 yuan to 8.71 yuan, and even 12.31 yuan. Although the market situation rebounded slightly on the 24th, the difference still reached more than 10 yuan. Because banks are not responsible for the risks of sending banknotes from China to the UK, and the sender must bear the risks themselves, holders of British banknotes are selling them as quickly as possible.

(2) Review of the Rising Public Debt

After the interest payment at the end of July, the public debt market was very strong. For example, taking the unified public debt A as an example, the closing price rose slowly from 60.9 yuan on August 1st to 61.75 yuan on the 6th. Although it then fluctuated and fell to 59.35 yuan on the 12th, it continued to rise to 61.6 yuan on the 21st, and then showed a slight decline.

When the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Banks during the Emergency Period" in December appeared in the newspapers, it coincided with the rebound of public debt. Therefore, some people believe that the rise in public debt was due to the banks absorbing it in view of the need to pay a 10% reserve. However, this explanation is not necessarily reliable. In my previous financial commentary, I pointed out that the reserve paid by the banks is legal tender, not government securities. Therefore, the rise in public debt is definitely not due to the banks absorbing it to pay the reserve.

### Dutch Red Sugar Rebounds Sharply

Yesterday, the price of all foreign sugar increased, with Dutch red sugar rising more sharply. The guild's spot prices for current goods were 74 yuan to 74.2 yuan for crude white sugar from foreign warehouses, up 0.7 yuan; old goods were 73 yuan; Taikoo's refined white sugar B mark was 74.3 yuan, up 0.3 yuan; DY mark remained at 69.5 yuan. Dutch red sugar 　 mark initially reached 62.8 yuan, then rose to 63.45 yuan, a total increase of 1.56 yuan. (The spot price of Dutch red sugar 　 mark was 61.9 yuan the day before, mistakenly written as 61 yuan. HX mark refined white sugar increased by 0.89 yuan, mistakenly written as 7.89 yuan. This correction is attached.)

### New Dried Longan Mostly Poor Harvests

The seedlings of this year's new dried longan were initially lush and promising for a bumper harvest. However, due to excessive rainfall later, most of the flowers fell off, resulting in a poor harvest. As the harvest season approaches, letters from Zhangzhou, Tong'an, Anhai, Xinghua, and other places indicate that the yield is only 30-40%. Only Quanzhou initially reported 40%, but there is a possibility of an increase recently, with larger yields potentially reaching 50%.

### Pepper and Sago Show Different Trends

Pepper sales have been quite active recently, resulting in a gradual depletion of inventory. The price of both black large pepper and No. 1 pepper has increased by 1 yuan, and the current market price is 107 yuan. White pepper remains firm and shows a strong trend. However, the price of sago has suddenly fallen, currently selling for only 82 yuan, a decrease of about 6 yuan compared to before.

### New York Pound Stable

New York, 24th: The pound exchange rate remains very stable, initially opening at $4.02, once reaching as high as $4.03, but ultimately settling at $4.025, a slight decrease of 0.025 compared to the previous day's closing.

### Black Iron Billets Arrive, Prices Rise First, Then Stabilize

Yesterday, the market for black iron billets was not particularly short of supply. Traders from Tianjin showed considerable interest, and sales on this street also showed signs of activity, so prices showed a significant upward trend. Later, because traders from Tianjin did not make purchases, only inquiries, and the amount purchased by toy factories, printing factories, thermos factories, and mirror factories on this street was quite small. For example, thermos factories are not in a hurry to purchase because the season has not yet arrived, and the industry's thinking is not very rigid. The market price has relaxed and stabilized at the previous market price. Each 2,000-pound bundle sells for 1,000 yuan, and each 200-pound box sells for 90 yuan, with transactions of about one to two hundred boxes. Most of the trading is done by hardware stores on North Suzhou Road. An investigation shows that the inventory in Shanghai is not exhausted, and large-scale purchases have not yet begun, so there is no immediate concern about an imbalance between supply and demand.

### Firewood is Exceptionally Lively

Recently, the source of firewood has been hindered by certain parties, and the arrival of sailboats has been scarce, with only five ships from the river. Therefore, people are worried about shortages, and sellers are making efforts. The market atmosphere is exceptionally lively. Large-sized firewood with white bark is sold for one yuan per bundle, medium-sized Taiwanese firewood is two and a half bundles, Dalbergia odorifera firewood is two bundles, Dragon 　 firewood is four bundles, and small Sijiao firewood is five bundles. Transportation by carts from the dock is subject to additional cartage fees.

### The Literary School of Sanjiang (3)

Since the Taiping Rebellion was quelled, the atmosphere has changed drastically again. People often express previous 　 meanings using contemporary forms, with harmonious tones and profound meanings, unlike those who merely imitate the external appearance and are empty inside. All deviant and pretentious styles are also not favored. Observers say that there is an opportunity to return to simplicity and purity, and prosperity is about to be restored. However, to win with meaning, one must rely on scholarship, whether it be classics, history, parables, using the past to lament the present, or using objects to convey meaning. One cannot force it. To win with words, one must rely on hard work, polishing and refining, removing impurities, with resounding sounds and fresh vocabulary. One cannot do it casually. Those who can do this are definitely veterans. Newcomers also want to follow suit, but although the style is achieved, the interest is not lasting. Everything is revealed at a glance, making people bored! In the examination halls, fake tripods are mixed with real ones, and they are often sold off. People who get lucky are even more numerous than before, because in the past, people focused on winning with style, but now the literary form can never be changed again, and imitation is easy. In the past, only Shuntian had no literary atmosphere, because the elders in Beijing had a fixed style for reviewing essays, and writers specialized in imitating this style, so every examination's 　 ink had no difference, but it only became weaker and weaker. 　 Provinces were always promoted as the three places of Jiangnan, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi, and the examination ink was published and eagerly viewed. However, recent examinations have been unsatisfactory. Chu and North are small provinces. Yesterday, new ink came by post, and everyone thought it was above Jiangzhe. It can be seen that the promotion of the Sanjiang literary school is not fixed either.

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### The Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation of Poor Teachers

— Meng Bai

Written on Teachers' Day

Nine out of ten teachers are poor, and their lives are in extremely difficult circumstances. Especially in today's situation, with rice and firewood as expensive as pearls and cassia, teachers' income is so meager, making them particularly distressed. Tomorrow is Teachers' Day; therefore, I want to write about the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of a group of poor teachers below to fill a corner of this publication.

Clothing: In this day and age, needless to say those who wear Western suits, making a new Western suit costs hundreds of dollars, and even Chinese clothing is really unaffordable. Therefore, most poor teachers only wear some old clothes. If it is unavoidable to make new clothes, they always choose the cheapest gauze. Indeed, not to mention anything else, a pair of leather shoes costs twenty or thirty dollars, perhaps a month's salary to buy a new pair of leather shoes. If the price of clothing materials continues to rise, then poor teachers will really not be able to afford clothes!

Food: If the meals are provided by the school, eight people at a table, four bowls of oil-free white-cooked dishes, accompanied by the most basic indica rice, it will really get stuck in the throat and be difficult to swallow. If you cook yourself, you can only buy some vegetables every day. In this day and age, chicken, duck, fish, and meat are frighteningly expensive and have nothing to do with teachers. Some really do not taste meat all year round, making their faces particularly thin and yellow, showing a lack of fat and insufficient nutrition!

Housing: Living in the school means you don't have to rent a house, and the burden can be lighter. But in today's world where every inch of land is worth gold, the teachers' dormitories are really a bit too much. Several teachers live together in a very small room, where the air doesn't circulate much. This is still good. Some even sleep in the classroom, with desks as beds, taking down the bed in the morning and setting up the bed at night. Living outside the school, what teachers can afford to rent is only a garret or a kitchen lean-to. And now a garret costs at least ten dollars, and many poor teachers can't even afford a garret and have to live in an attic!

Transportation: In this world of Shanghai, sitting costs money and walking costs money. Nothing can be done without money. In the past year, trams and buses have increased in price several times. Poor teachers don't dare to go out unless there is an important matter. Every day, they just wander around the school. If it is unavoidable to go out, needless to say rickshaws are unaffordable, even trams and buses are not taken. They still have to walk the long distance with their two feet.

### Ways to Utilize Old Socks

— Zi Fang

The socks we wear are most easily damaged due to the pressure of our body weight and walking. On average, we wear out a pair every two months, so there are six pairs of old socks every year. Calculated by the family, the number is very considerable. If we throw away so many old socks casually, it's really a pity! Because most of the damaged parts of the socks are only the toes and heels, and the sock tops are mostly intact. We wash the socks, cut off the damaged parts, take down the threads from the sock parts, wind them into round beads, and combine multiple strands of thread. We can knit children's clothing, pants, shoes, socks, and belts. If you like darker colors, use colored sock threads; if you like lighter colors, add some white sock threads. Turn the sock over, because the reverse side has miscellaneous patterns, you can cut along the patterns. Then, pull out the broken thread ends, and draw out the long thread ends, so you can smoothly unravel it all the way to the sock opening. (If it is a double-thread sock, you must pull out the two threads at the same time.) When knitting, put multiple thread balls together, bring the thread ends together, and then you can weave and pull the threads at the same time. If one ball of thread is pulled out first, then attach another ball of thread. If you want the woven fabric to be thicker, combine more threads; if you want it to be thinner, combine fewer threads. Although the woven fabric is not as soft and warm as wool yarn, it is very suitable to wear in spring and autumn weather. It is also easy to wash when it gets dirty, unlike wool fabrics that are difficult to wash.

Autumn is coming soon, and sisters are about to engage in knitting again. But wool yarn is more than ten yuan a pound, so expensive that you don't dare to ask the price. Let's still use waste materials. (Payment to the Children's Library)

### Celebrities and Food

— Zheng Yimei

Ye Zhongfu from Meili, Wujiang, presented Sheng Xingxuan with water peaches produced in his area, along with apricots and garlic. Sheng greatly appreciated them for their color, aroma, and taste, considering them the only delicacies. Peaches are often infested with insects. Ye would first cover the peaches with lanterns before they were ripe and pick the large ones with small vermilion circles on the skin as gifts, as there were no scientific medicines to prevent fruit insects at that time.

Kuang Zhou, a lyricist, was addicted to cherries. In his later years, he rented a residence at sea, calling it "Canying Wu" (Cherry-Eating Cottage), and wrote several volumes of "Canying Wu Wenbi" (Notes from the Cherry-Eating Cottage).

When Zuo Wenxiang came to Wu, someone presented him with Yangmei (Chinese bayberries) from Dongting Mountain. Zuo ate them and found them sweet, unknowingly emptying a basket. The next day, he fell ill. Zuo's servant thought it was the fault of the person who presented the Yangmei and arrested and flogged him. Soon after, Zuo recovered suddenly and learned of the incident. He felt that the servant had acted inappropriately and said, "If one eats sweet food in excess, the fault lies with me. Moreover, it cannot be determined whether the illness was caused by eating too much Yangmei." So he flogged his servant instead, which was widely circulated as a joke.

Du Mu's poem: "A courier arrives with a cloud of dust, but no one knows it's lychees for the concubine," indicates that Yang Guifei was addicted to lychees. However, due to eating too much, she suffered from tooth problems.

Mencius: "Zeng Xi liked lamb dates, Zeng Shen couldn't bear to eat lamb dates." Note: Lamb dates are wolfberry dates. The predecessor Cheng Zhanlu used "lamb droppings dates" to match "potato melon," which people found difficult to achieve.

Xu Zhongke, a lyricist, liked to drink Pu'er tea, saying that it could aid digestion. When someone offered him Longjing tea, he rejected it without drinking it.

In his later years, Chen Shiyi lived near Rouge Bridge in Suzhou, with good furniture and a good cook, resembling Wei Huan Gong. On good days in spring and autumn, he prepared dishes to entertain guests. Two of his dishes, "Chestnut Mud" and "Jade Swallow Balls," were particularly characteristic. Chestnut Mud was made by pounding chestnuts, and it was loose, sweet, fragrant, and unmatched. Jade Swallow Balls were made by chopping meat into 　 and drying it, spreading it into thin sheets, and then rubbing the meat into small balls, which were cooked in a fresh soup and melted in the mouth.

### First Day of Business

### Blue Light Bulb

— Nai Liu

Using a blue light bulb in hot weather is really worth promoting.

A blue light bulb can make a room appear quieter and cooler. Even on a sultry evening, it won't cause irritability in the heart. Using a blue light bulb is like reducing the indoor temperature by about ten degrees. If it is in a study full of antique charm, it will be even more elegant!

In ordinary bedrooms or living rooms, under the blue light, having tea and chatting with one or two confidants, with a fan next to the room, the cool breeze is breezy. This kind of nightlife cannot be said to be without benefit to people who are tired from working during the day in terms of spirit.

Moreover, the benefits of blue light bulbs are not just these. For example, its light will not stimulate the optic nerve; blue light can prevent many annoying green insects and moths from being attracted; if you use blue light bulbs, the number of lights can be reduced a bit, thereby saving electricity costs, etc. These are all unique benefits of using blue light bulbs.

### Walking and Running

— Tian Qing

Everyone is of course very familiar with the two actions of walking and running, but if someone asks you: how can you do these two actions! This is not easy to answer. It can be seen that the more things we encounter often in our daily lives, the less easy it is to understand the principles behind them.

Walking and running are indispensable actions in our lives. Otherwise, the body will not be free. We are very happy to be able to walk and run. Moreover, our ability to walk and run is not learned from anyone. In childhood, we have already begun to learn in practice, with parents only guiding from the side. The scene of learning to walk in a shaky and stumbling manner is really sweet when recalled now. Walking and running are naturally learned successfully, which is entirely a kind of experience. This is exactly the same as learning to ride a bicycle and swim. It must be done in person, and it cannot be taught by anyone or books. Those are just guides.

Walking and running are very interesting from a physiological point of view; when a person stands on one left foot and lifts the right foot at the same time, the body tends forward, and the left heel has to be lifted. Then the center of gravity of the human body goes out of the body and is about to fall. At this time, the right foot is already in the air, and it quickly goes forward. At the same time, the knee of the left foot is slightly bent, and then the right foot touches the ground. The center of gravity is supported by the pillar formed by the two feet, so that balance can be maintained. The left foot is straightened by the contraction of the thigh bone muscles, immediately forming a straight line. This completes the step taken. If you want to continue to move forward, lean your body forward again, and the center of gravity will move outside the pillar. Then lift your left foot forward and take another step. Running is a vigorous exercise of walking. Because the stride of running is large, and the body is completely off the ground at one point during the action, the force required is also greater. These are all subtle movements in a moment. We never pay attention to them. From a physiological point of view, walking or running a step is really not an easy task.

Attention should be paid to the posture of walking and running: the body should be straight, the chest should be upright, the abdomen should be tucked in, the head should be straight, and the arm swings should be natural. When walking, the feet should not touch the ground heavily, otherwise it will have a great impact on the brain nerves. However, Chinese people have never paid attention to their walking posture. On the other hand, the Westerners have a spirited look when they walk, which we should imitate. Moreover, the price of taxis on the isolated island has increased repeatedly, and the monthly expenditure on taxi fares is really considerable. Why don't we advocate walking, which is also a good exercise for the body.

### One Week's Budget Menu

— Ms. Huaying

Last week, when we talked about beans, we couldn't forget the edamame, which is often used in vegetarian and meat dishes. It is also very rich in vitamin B and is comparable to broad beans. Edamame is also a very good thing, but it is often relegated to a supporting role. Whether it is fish, meat, chicken, or duck in meat dishes, or greens and radishes in vegetarian dishes, you always have to put some edamame in them. On the one hand, it can increase the umami taste, and on the other hand, it can make the dish more substantial, just like licorice in medicinal materials, which has many uses. As for the opportunity to stand alone, there are only two types: one is boiled edamame in salt water (with shells). During the Mid-Autumn Festival, it is almost a necessary food for every household in cooperation with taro. At ordinary times, it is most popular among drinkers and is often used as a snack with alcohol. The other type is to mix the shells with dry flour paste, add soy sauce, and stew them together. Compared to boiled edamame in salt water, it has a more flavorful taste and can be eaten with rice.

### Looking Squarely at "Our Own" Problems

— Same Illness

—Dedicated to the Dance Partners—

After reading Mr. Editor's "After Reading 'A Dance Partner's' Letter," my first feeling was that the dance halls, which have always been regarded as paradises of leisure, actually have such a dark side. I think other readers must share the same feeling with me, that the life and inner depths of "dance partners" are actually trapped in such pain and contradictions!

The two types of dance customers exposed to us by "A Dance Partner" should be the truth of the matter: In the final analysis, although they have two different roles and behaviors, their attempts either begin with indulgence in licentiousness or fascination with sensuality. Therefore, I also feel that the two points raised by "A Dance Partner": Firstly, hoping that those who have money and nowhere to spend it will contribute a portion to charity (including relief for the pitiful people in the dance halls), is, as Mr. Editor said, "easier said than done!" Secondly, hoping that some of the "free dance" crowd will work hard at their studies, is really "water off a duck's back." People in this situation are subjectively "fearless," and it is honestly difficult to change them through persuasion or even begging!

Here I deeply feel that the problem facing the "dance partners" is "their own" problem!

The reason why "dance partners" have reached this "dance partner" status may have to do with their economic, environmental, or even volitional reasons; but I always believe that "dance partner" is not the way out for the lives of "dance partners." Although there are lucky dance partners who "earn thousands of gold coins a night," can we possibly deny that the majority of "dance partners" are struggling in lives of poverty and humiliation? At the same time, I think that tempting or even hastening some young people to fall into the trap of pornography is certainly not what our well-meaning "dance partners" would like to do, right?

"Strive for your own normal way out!" I would like to offer my sincere call to more "dance partners." Naturally, learning and enriching one's knowledge and skills are the most basic and important things. Fortunately, today's society has more than just "dance partner" as a way out, although there are many difficulties in moving forward in other fields, we should use the greatest perseverance and courage to achieve the determination to obtain happiness, and we should not be discouraged or in pain when we encounter obstacles and difficulties!

May all dance partners face "their own" problems squarely!

### Record of Riding the "Factory-Bound Tram"

— Chen Kai

A factory-bound tram is a tram whose daily route is complete, and it is returning to the factory for rest. The ticket seller and driver can also "clock off," but the "factory-bound tram" is not necessarily a "Laska."

That night, I was returning home from Jiangxi Road, and it was almost eleven o'clock, and I took a "Laska" that was "factory-bound." I was waiting for the tram in front of the Wu Zhou Pharmacy. There was only me at the stop. Because I was bored waiting for the tram, I casually paced along the sidewalk. After pacing I walked to the corner of the chessboard street at the main entrance of Wu Zhou. When I heard the sound coming from the electric wire, I rushed back to the station. I heard the bell on the tram, and fortunately, the driver had not yet accelerated to full speed, so I relied on the shameful skills of jumping on trams from my student days and jumped through the iron gate that was about to close. In fact, this was really risky. If the iron gate had closed before my feet were firmly planted, I would either have been dragged down and killed by the tram, or my hand holding the copper bar would have been crushed. But at the time, I didn't think about anything. Instead, I was proud of my victory, and I was finally sitting in the tram carriage.

There were no other passengers in either the third or first class sections. The ticket seller sat in the corner of the carriage, with his hat on his lap, concentrating on working on a complex calculation, like a series of equations. The pencil was marking back and forth, and even though I handed him my corner ticket two or three times, he didn't indicate that I wanted to buy a ticket. When the tram passed Huajin Lane, I really admired the ticket seller's multi-tasking ability. As soon as the tram approached, he jumped up, pulled the rope bell that ran through the third and first class sections to tell the driver to "stop" or "start," and the tram glided past the Huajin Lane stop with two "da-da" sounds.

Many people boarded the tram at the Xianshi World station. The ticket seller's series of equations must have been answered, and he was busy selling tickets. My ticket was also for the Xianshi World station. He didn't try to pocket the extra money, so I naturally couldn't take advantage of him either, so I told him that I got on the tram on Henan Road, but he didn't hear me.

The tram continued to run until it reached the Great World.

When the tram passed Avenue Edward VII, there were two fully loaded trams pulling away in front. Only two or three passengers came on board our tram. Next to me sat a fat woman, wearing a black silk short top and trousers, with a palm-leaf fan in her hand. This was a special class in Shanghai. After buying her ticket, she lit a cigarette and seemed very leisurely.

I don't know why the tram didn't stop at Nanyang Bridge at the Rue Menteny crossing. One passenger started to make a fuss, but the tram had "rules" that it wasn't allowed to stop at stations. He was finally taken to Nanyang Bridge at Rue Bourgeat. I also heard a joke flying by my ear: "You got a bargain, you got to ride an extra stop!"

A few people in the tram laughed. But before the laughter stopped, the fat woman next to me started to make a fuss:

"Why didn't you stop at Rue Ghisi?"

Before anyone could answer, the tram stopped at Taiping Bridge. The fat woman squeezed into the platform entrance to stop passengers from getting on and off, wanting to argue with the ticket seller. Her arrogance was so great that even the other passengers dared not persuade her. At this difficult moment, the ticket seller suddenly discovered that the ticket in the fat woman's hand was for Nanyang Bridge. This powerful evidence forced the fat woman to get off the tram while being scolded. The rest of the journey was peaceful, and everyone treated the fat woman's joke as gossip, as comfortable as family members drinking tea after dinner. At each station, only passengers got off, and none got on. The driver's foot bell and the ticket seller's hand bell quickly sent me to my destination - and of course, I once again showed off my stunt of jumping off the tram.

### Counter Staff Should Have Self-Esteem

— Zhong En

On the 20th, I saw the article "A Counter Macaque" in this publication, and it made me very unhappy after reading it. Counter staff are also legitimate businessmen. Social malice even adds nicknames such as "Counter Macaques" and "Counter Lions," which means that they are as restless as macaques when busy and as immobile as stone lions when idle. This kind of naming has exhausted the ability to be frivolous and pitiful. You should know that we, as counter staff, should be quick and polite to customers in transactions, and we should not leave the counter during business hours. The author actually used this as the title, admitting to being "A Counter Macaque," which really lacks self-esteem and makes many counter staff feel unhappy. As for commenting on women, despising work, and belittling oneself, they are not what general intelligent staff should do. I am also a counter staff member, and I would like to share some encouragement with the counter staff and always respect themselves. In leisure time, such as exploring commercial knowledge and investigating social situations, we can pay attention to them at any time and place. Why bother to take pleasure in commenting on women with the general depraved people?

Hawthorne's Case

### The Ending of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 6 Dangerous Experience

At this time, the car had already entered Changming Road. I looked out of the car, not wanting to miss Lane 1 of Changming Lane. Unexpectedly, as the car was approaching the entrance of Lane 1, a man in a tea-rose colored suit was walking out of the lane. I took a closer look, and it was indeed that Yu Gantang!

This unexpected discovery, of course, made me suddenly nervous. I hurriedly pressed the elbow bone of my left arm against Ni Jinshou's arm and exclaimed in a low voice.

"It's really him—Yu Gantang."

Ni Jinshou also nervously left his seat and issued an order to "stop the car." Before the car had completely stopped, he had already opened the door of the carriage and jumped out. I also followed him out of the car and saw Yu Gantang standing on the side of the sidewalk, raising his right hand to call a rickshaw across the road. Ni Jinshou did not hesitate, went straight to him, and suddenly greeted him.

"Yu Gantang, where are you going?"

The young man's body shook, and he suddenly turned his head, his face full of shock. His gaze only flashed on Ni Jinshou's face, and the raised right hand suddenly fell, as if to reach into the right pocket of his clothes.

"Don't move!" Ni Jinshou's pistol had already left its holster, and the muzzle was pressed against Yu Gantang's abdomen; his left hand simultaneously reached into the right pocket of Yu Gantang's Western-style coat. In an instant, he really pulled out an old-fashioned nickel-plated revolver. My hand was also holding the trigger in my pocket, but there was no need to take it out at this time.

Yu Gantang was initially a little panicked, but after his pistol was searched out by Ni Jinshou, his demeanor became calm instead.

He asked, "What are you doing? Who are you?"

Ni Jinshou replied while putting the searched pistol in his pocket, "It's nothing. You don't need to hire a rickshaw. There's a ready-made car here."

He said suspiciously: "But are you going to kidnap me?—" His gaze turned to me, revealing some surprise, as if the impression he had just gotten on the elevator had not disappeared. "Are you government officials?"

Ni Jinshou replied, "You're really smart. Let's go." (87)
