### Qin-Yi Highway, Chinese Army Attacks Along the Line
　　
　　Xingji: The Chinese army has been attacking along the Qin-Yi Highway for days, achieving many victories. The Japanese are increasingly panicked.

Hankou: Price Hike

　　Hankou: The soaring cost of living here is shocking, making it difficult for most residents to survive. The "official" price of rice is 40 yuan per unit, but since August 1st, rice prices have doubled, reaching an unprecedented high of over 80 yuan. The lower and middle classes cannot afford rice and are forced to fill their stomachs with other coarse grains, leading to increasingly poor nutrition. Speculation by unscrupulous merchants is indeed occurring, but there are no specific laws governing price controls. Although the "Municipal Government" has held meetings to discuss this issue and has reportedly established a price evaluation committee and a group to clear channels for supply, the general public doubts the value of these measures. The prices of other commodities such as beans, salt, and meat are also double what they were one or two months ago. The reasons are the same as for the rice price hike: the ban on exporting rice and grains from non-occupied areas, the trouble with transportation permits, guerrilla activities, and the export of goods by Japanese vehicles. This situation is largely the same as in Shanghai. The coal shortage problem also seems unsolvable. Coal prices have risen dramatically in recent months, now selling for an extremely high price of 500 yuan per ton, and even at that price, buying coal is considered fortunate, as coal has become the exclusive domain of Mitsui & Co. Although the official price of coal is 195 Japanese yen per ton, it is just like the official price of rice at 40 yuan per unit – almost no one can actually buy it at that price. Other fuels are also extremely difficult to obtain. (4th Reuters dispatch)

Chinese Military Experts Discuss the Possibility of a U.S.-Japan War; Japan is Mobilizing Five Divisions to Cope with Future War, Its Main Goal Being to Occupy Singapore and the Dutch East Indies

　　Chongqing: This morning's Central Daily News published a special article by various military experts, including former Chinese Air Force leader General Xu Peigen, listing possible actions by the U.S. and Japan in a Pacific war. It stated that after the U.S. obtained permission to use Singapore and Darwin as naval and air bases, its fleet would not need to pass through the Japanese-held Caroline Islands but would instead take the route through Samoa and Darwin towards Manila and Singapore. The U.S. could effectively blockade Japan by sea, extending from northern Alaska and the Aleutian Islands to Hawaii, Samoa, Australia, the Philippines, Singapore, and China. To cope with a future war in the Pacific, Japan is currently mobilizing five divisions, three of which are being withdrawn from Guizhou and Vietnam, one in Taiwan, and another from Japan. Xu believes that the Japanese fleet will move towards the Caroline Islands to intercept the U.S. fleet, while the Japanese army will attack the Dutch East Indies or Singapore. To control the Pacific, Japan must inflict a heavy blow on the U.S. fleet or occupy the naval base in Singapore. Japan's main military objective is to occupy Singapore, and its main economic objective is the Dutch East Indies. Japan's occupation of these islands would seriously hinder the westward advance of the U.S. fleet. (4th Reuters dispatch)

　　Chongqing: Chinese newspapers here consider the return of Japanese envoy to the Dutch East Indies, Minister of Commerce Kobayashi, and envoy to Nanjing, Abe, as an indication of the failure of negotiations with the Dutch East Indies and Nanjing.

Sichuan-Xikang Economic Construction Committee Officially Established in Chengdu; Three-Day Meeting Concludes Successfully; Specific Construction Plans Formulated

　　Chengdu: The Sichuan-Xikang Economic Construction Committee officially held its inaugural ceremony in Chengdu on November 2nd. Immediately afterwards, it convened its first plenary meeting with 68 committee members including Liu Wenhui and He Guoguang. Chairman Chiang had originally intended to preside in person, but due to important matters, he could not attend and instructed Standing Committee member Zhang Qun to represent him. The meeting lasted for three days and closed successfully at noon on the 4th. Three plenary meetings and three group review meetings were held, resolving over 70 important cases. The committee combined the strengths of the government and the people, bringing together leaders from the Party, government, military, and civilian sectors of Sichuan and Xikang, as well as renowned scholars from within and outside the province, to jointly plan the development of economic construction in Sichuan and Xikang. This session of the conference followed Chairman Chiang's draft outline of the Sichuan-Xikang economic construction plan, the Sichuan Provincial Production Planning Committee's draft three-year economic construction plan for Sichuan Province, the Xikang Provincial Government's outline of economic construction for Xikang Province, and proposals from various committee members, and collected opinions from experts inside and outside the conference to formulate a comprehensive and specific Sichuan-Xikang economic construction plan. At the same time, it was decided to expand funding and quickly form the Sichuan-Xikang Industrial Development Company as a mechanism for practically promoting economic construction. The foundation for economic construction in Sichuan and Xikang has thus been laid. (4th dispatch)

Editorial: Changes in the Sino-Japanese War Situation

　　In the past week, there have been extraordinary changes in the Sino-Japanese war situation. After the Japanese side called for the launch of the so-called autumn offensive, carrying out the so-called mopping-up and annihilation battles, and touting the so-called encirclement and suppression, the Chinese army recovered Nanning in Guangxi, Shaoxing in Zhejiang, and the Guangdong vanguard has already surrounded Qinzhou. In addition, various war results have been achieved in Hubei, Shanxi, and Henan. This is an unprecedented atmosphere in the more than three years of China's resistance and a significant shift in the war situation.

　　The Japanese side claimed that all these retreats were automatic withdrawals, but there is no way to ask why. After the autumn offensive, it was an automatic withdrawal. Why is there such indecision in strategy? After the Japanese army withdrew, the Chinese army entered the city. Why did the results not achieve the effect of annihilation and suppression? When the Vietnam agreement was just signed and the Chinese army's large encirclement military deployment in Guangxi was just completed, the Japanese army, disregarding the violation of the Vietnam agreement, urgently took the road from Guangxi, China, through Lang Son, Vietnam, and then turned to Haiphong. Was this a deliberate breach of faith to destroy the agreement, or a military passive act of no alternative? These are impossible to pursue, and insightful people can find the answers themselves without pursuing them!

　　Chinese generals and soldiers have fought hard for more than three years, unyielding, persistent, and sacrificing their flesh and blood to create the current war situation. They will inevitably be respected by everyone, and their hard work and great achievements will inevitably be remembered by everyone. However, everyone must also realize that now is not the time to boast of military achievements, whether it is the recovery of Nanning and Shaoxing, or the recovery of some other famous cities and towns. The advance and retreat on the first and second lines, the gain and loss of one or two places, have nothing to do with the overall war situation. There is no need to be proud of gaining Nanning and Shaoxing, just as there is no need to be depressed about losing Nanning and Shaoxing. The determination of the overall situation must await the final victory of the overall situation. If the final victory has not yet been realized, then all efforts and all precautions must not be relaxed for a day. The recovery of Nanning and Shaoxing is certainly joyful, but joy is often infiltrated by relaxation, which is a great warning. It must be known that the Japanese side had to withdraw from Nanning and Shaoxing, which, although a fact illustrating the surge in the strength of the Chinese army, is still a distance from the Chinese army's general counter-offensive and the Japanese army's general collapse. If the Japanese army has not yet completely collapsed, then there is still room to launch other conspiracies and tricks. Even if all conspiracies and tricks ultimately fail, those who deal with them should still be strict from beginning to end. Taking a hundred steps back, if the Nanning and Shaoxing campaigns are indeed an automatic withdrawal as claimed by the Japanese side, then why withdraw? What will happen after the withdrawal? These questions cannot be easily let go. From his defense, we know he conceals defeat; from his concealing defeat, we know he has no remorse; from his not repenting, we must guard against him concentrating his remaining forces at a certain key point to launch another strategic breakthrough. Perhaps this is the answer to "What will happen after the withdrawal." If not, it has withdrawn to its territory, far from the front line. But why can't it be regarded as a rest and reorganization, slowly plotting a last-ditch effort? If not, the withdrawal is in preparation for controlling all of Vietnam, in preparation for peeking into British Burma, in preparation for invading the Dutch East Indies, and China can from now on mind its own business and not care about others. But if it does not give up its policy of aggression for a day, then even if it is carrying out its so-called "automatic withdrawal" in China at present, we must be wary of it seizing resources in the south and then launching a large-scale invasion of China again.

　　War and peace are not doctrines and beliefs in the realm of thought, but obvious facts. The period when Japanese troops remain on Chinese soil absolutely cannot deny the existence of a state of war. Recently, the Japanese side, in terms of military affairs, concealed defeat and called it an automatic withdrawal - even if it was not concealing defeat, in terms of propaganda, it temporarily stopped saying that it was urgently seeking to end the China Incident and spread rumors that the Chinese government was about to change its diplomatic route, trying to save the Soviet Union and Germany to mediate peace. Its intention is to make China's friendly countries doubt the attitude of the Chinese government, stop their support for China, and objective observers only see it as a naive self-mockery. In all fairness, Japan's strength has declined after three years of consumption. Whether Nanning and Shaoxing were retreats or self-withdrawals, in short, they could not be defended or had to "self-withdraw." The overall situation of the Sino-Japanese war has begun to change due to the waxing and waning of strength. But this is a change in the war situation, not a change in peace and war. At present, the remaining power of Japan should not be underestimated too much. What is most urgent at present is to tightly grasp the pivot of the waxing and waning changes until the complete "self-withdrawal" of the Japanese army in China.

U.S. Two-Party Election Ends; General Election Held Today; Whether Roosevelt or Wilkie is Elected, Both Will Adopt a Strong Far East Policy, Defend U.S. Rights and Give China Greater Assistance

　　Washington: On the eve of the U.S. election, there is a very good sign in the situation, that is, whether Roosevelt or Wilkie is elected, both will adopt a strong Far East policy, actively defend U.S. rights, and give China greater assistance. Political circles also expect that if Roosevelt is re-elected tomorrow, the United States will have a major decision on foreign policy. (4th United Press dispatch)

　　Washington: The two political parties' election campaign ended today in a lively atmosphere. Union leaders declared that the current election, the most intense in 25 years, will be decided by the workers' vote. In fact, there are 50 million voters in the United States. Whether the Republican or Democratic Party will be elected will only be known after tomorrow's general election. Private observers and public opinion polls all indicated last night that the election results will be neck and neck, with no major victory or defeat. However, both parties are confident that they will win. Union leader John Lewis, who now supports the Republican Party, said that the election results will depend on the labor vote. He said that the entire labor community must choose whether to elect a leader they support or another leader who creates a war-mongering opinion. These two must know how to choose themselves. He firmly believes that Wilkie will be elected. The president of the American Federation of Labor, Green, reiterated the union's impartiality. Green told his members, "Vote according to your own judgment and conscience." Democratic Party Chairman Flynn predicted that Roosevelt would win 420 of the 531 electoral votes. Republican Party Chairman Martin believed that Wilkie would win 324 votes. Leaders of both parties hope to win the important 47 votes in New York. However, observers believe that if Wilkie wants to win, he must win these votes. As for President Roosevelt, he has already secured the votes of several southwestern states. Whether he can be re-elected will not be affected by the number of votes in New York. However, the Democratic Party will not easily give up these votes, so the competition between the two parties in New York is very fierce. Judging from the situation last night, the major industrial states in the United States, such as New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, and New Jersey, will determine the final victory of the election. It is estimated that 17 million independent voters will go to the polls tomorrow. These people supported President Roosevelt in 1932 and 1938, but supported the Republican Party in the 1938 congressional elections. The phenomenon of the "three-term re-election" propaganda camp led by the Mayor of New York showed last night that President Roosevelt will definitely win an amazing victory. At the same time, according to the opinions of numerous experts, the president can at least win 200 to 231 votes. If the president can be sure of 231 votes, and then get 35 more votes, he can win. In other words, if Wilkie wants to win, he must win the total number of votes in the western, central, and eastern industrial areas. If this election used the rules of 1916, the results will be announced on Wednesday or Thursday. (4th United Press dispatch)

　　New York: Gallup predicts that although Roosevelt still has an advantage in public opinion in the U.S. presidential election, it is difficult to predict who can get the majority of votes. (4th United Press dispatch)

　　New York: The results of the final test vote in tomorrow's presidential election are very close. President Roosevelt has arrived at Hyde Park and will give a radio address from there tonight. Wilkie will also make a final appeal on the radio at midnight today. (4th Reuters dispatch)

　　New York: The competition in the U.S. election is extremely exciting. On the eve of this election, there is still a radio speech to end the election competition. Roosevelt has returned to Hyde Park for a short rest to await the results of Tuesday's election. Republican presidential candidate Wilkie has also returned to his home in New York. According to general public opinion here, the number of votes for both sides may not be very different, and Roosevelt still has the advantage. Wilkie traveled to 34 states by plane, train, and car, covering a total of 30,000 miles. The intensity of the competition is unprecedented in this century. No less than 12 million people listened to his speeches, and Wilkie gave more than 500 speeches to the public. President Roosevelt, due to his busy government affairs, could not leave Washington, D.C. for a long time, so he did not go to as many places as Wilkie. Supporters of Roosevelt often threw eggs and tomatoes at Wilkie during his speeches. This kind of campaign tactic can be described as terrible, because observers believe that throwing an egg will cause the Democratic Party to lose many votes. (4th Reuters dispatch)

Roosevelt, Hull, and Others Discuss Foreign Affairs; The Theme is the Caribbean Situation; Martinique is Willing to be Protected by the United States

　　New York: President Roosevelt returned to Washington on Sunday to discuss the foreign situation with Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary of State Welles. The New York Times Washington correspondent reported that the main event discussed in the above talks was obviously the situation in the Caribbean.

　　Washington: A Washington Star correspondent in Fort-de-France, French West Indies, reported that the people of the island want to replace the tricolor flag with the Stars and Stripes so that they can be free from German control under American rule and alleviate the economic difficulties caused by the British blockade. The correspondent also quoted residents as saying that if a public vote were held, three-quarters of the voters would vote in favor of the United States taking over the island. According to Washington sources, there is a possibility of establishing a compromise that would preserve the French legal authority on the island without transferring the sea, land, and air bases to the British, thereby opposing German armistice conditions.

Sudden Changes in the International Situation; Japanese Trade Affected; Inventory of Export Goods Increases Significantly; Domestic Capital Turnover is Sluggish

　　Tokyo: Japan's foreign trade is currently adversely affected due to sudden changes in international political and commercial conditions, the outbreak of the European war, and the establishment of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance. In recent months, the inventory of export goods has increased significantly, resulting in a very unfavorable domestic capital turnover. In order to eliminate the factors that may hinder Japan's domestic and international trade, the Finance Minister has decided to change Japan's foreign trade policy. In the future, the government will focus its efforts on increasing trade between the Japanese yen and the German-Italian Axis countries, and will no longer pay attention to the U.S. dollar and British pound groups. According to Yomiuri Shimbun, the Finance Minister has recently instructed his subordinates to draft specific measures in accordance with this policy. (4th Reuters dispatch)

According to news reaching the Greek High Command, Florina has been relieved of danger. Greek forces defending the strategically important Yannina have also repelled repeated Italian attacks. As Italian and Greek forces became embroiled in fierce fighting along the Kalamas and Byskyriq rivers, the Greek vanguard advanced further into Albanian territory. It is reported that Italian forces have successfully crossed the Kalamas River using pontoon bridges, but other Italian forces attempting to cross the Byskyriq River have been repeatedly repulsed by Greek forces. According to yesterday's news, after crossing the Kalamas River, Italian forces advanced towards Konitsa, but the strong Greek front line has hindered the Italian attempt to continue advancing. (4th International News Agency dispatch)

Greek Forces Enter Albanian Territory; Have Surrounded Korçë

　　Bitola, southern border of Greece: The Italian invasion of Greece was greatly endangered last night, as Greek forces are making surprising progress in Albanian territory and will occupy Korçë. Greek and British aircraft squadrons attacked the Albanian capital Tirana, and several buildings were badly damaged, including the royal palace. The port facilities of Santi Quaranta were also heavily damaged. According to battlefield dispatches received here, Italian forces trying to reach Yannina, an important Greek railway center, have been repelled by Greek forces with heavy casualties. Battle reports from all fronts indicate that since the Italian invasion of Greece, the number of Italian soldiers and officers captured has reached 2,200, and hundreds have been killed. Dozens of tanks have been seized. Large units of Italian troops are reportedly surrounded near Korçë and are expected to surrender soon. It is said that in the land and air battles on the Yannina and Korçë fronts, the Greek side has been steadily advancing and consolidating their positions. Battlefield dispatches state that Greek mountain troops have entered Albanian territory fifteen miles and completed the encirclement of Korçë after a day-long battle yesterday. The Greek High Command stated that in the Epirus front, Italian forces who launched a large-scale attack on Yannina from the western exit of the Pindus Mountains have been repelled and suffered heavy losses. It is said that thousands of Italian soldiers in this area have been captured by Greek forces. The dispatches continued that after repelling the Italian forces advancing on Yannina, Greek forces immediately counterattacked and defeated the Italian forces. It is said that the Italian forces were unfamiliar with the terrain and were lured into dangerous mountain passes where Greek artillery fired simultaneously, causing the entire Italian army to collapse. The Greek encirclement of Korçë is considered one of the most surprising achievements in modern military history. Last night, the Italian side urgently dispatched reinforcements to the area, but it is feared that they will not arrive in time, as the Greek side also urgently dispatched its vanguard to lay ambushes. (4th International News Agency dispatch)

　　Athens: The Greek High Command announced here today that Greek reinforcements from the Florina area had entered Albanian territory in succession late yesterday and early this morning, launching a fierce counterattack. Italian forces could not hold and are retreating from the important town of Korçë. A new Italian offensive in the mountain passes west of Yannina has been repelled. It is said that due to the Greek counterattack and successive advances, the Italian army is in dire straits. It is also said that Greek and British aircraft squadrons are assisting ground troops, using machine guns to strafe the retreating Italian forces. Greek kilted mountain warriors and tank units have surrounded Korçë. The 15,000 Italian troops defending the city are in danger of being completely annihilated. It is expected that British forces will urgently move north to help Greek forces maintain their wedge-shaped position in Korçë until the number of reinforcements equals the Italian forces, and then the Greek and British allied forces will launch a large-scale attack into Albanian territory. (4th International News Agency dispatch)

　　Ohrid, Southern Capital: Elite Greek mountain combat units that entered Albanian territory yesterday began to attack Italian forces. First, after 36 hours of attacks, Greek forces seized many positions, and now they are departing from these positions, shouting the traditional Greek slogan, "We must drive the enemy into the sea!" The vanguard of the Greek forces is the world-famous Evzones, wearing pleated skirts. According to news from the border, Italian forces have lost all the advantages they gained in the past five days of fighting, and the Italian forces attacking Florina are in danger of having their rear cut off. (4th United Press dispatch)

　　Southern Capital: According to observers on both shores of Lake Prespa, the Greek army, after two days of rest, has consolidated the right wing of its position and seems to have taken appropriate measures to prevent attacks by motorized units from Prilapor, which could open the door for enemy forces to invade the Macedonian plains. Greek forces are still blocking the Italian advance. Italian planes bombed several undefended cities today, killing and wounding several civilians, but military targets were undamaged. Greek forces shot down six Italian planes yesterday. Greek morale is very high, and the people are very excited about the news of British aid. British planes continue to conduct reconnaissance flights over Greek territory, and one opportunity attacked and shot down an Italian plane. (4th Reuters dispatch)

Traffic in the Greek Corridor Has Come to a Halt, Affecting Turkish Commerce

　　Istanbul: Since the outbreak of the Italian-Greek war, transportation in the Greek Corridor has come to a standstill, resulting in the interruption of direct rail traffic between Turkey and other parts of Europe. Although Turkey has repeatedly urged Greece to pay attention to the important relationship between the Turkish capital-Bulgarian capital railway line passing through the Greek Corridor and Turkey, the Turkish authorities have not yet received a response from the Greek government on this issue. It is understood that if Greece refuses to restore traffic in the corridor, Turkey will operate automobile traffic along the Turkish border, from Koprulu via Adrianople to the Bulgarian border, which will be able to solve the problem of transporting mail and a small number of passengers, but this is only a temporary measure. The general public still hopes that Turkey and Greece can agree to restore traffic in the Greek Corridor as soon as possible, which is extremely important to Turkey's commercial relations with Central and Western Europe.

It was estimated that banks entered 20 taels of gold to gold firms, at 5,538 yuan. Then, money exchange businesses gave 20 taels to banks, at 5,525 yuan.

The bullish rumors of the morning were all found to be false, causing a large selling trend. Gold and silver firms sold heavily, and securities firms shorted more. The price was pressed down to within the 5,500 yuan level. It was estimated that banks doing business with each other for 20 taels was only 5,470 yuan.

However, it will reduce the convenience of payment and deposit for general customers by these few days.

Securities New Prices for Domestic Debt Repeatedly Found

Unified Class A Broke the Seventy Yuan Level

The securities black market, initially fell yesterday due to the court issue, and then rose due to short covering. The difference between the high and low market prices was one yuan and six corners. Class A even broke the 70 yuan level, Class C even reached two yuan, and Class E also broke the 61 yuan level. The unified government bonds all saw new highs. This rise was entirely due to short covering, because there was a shortage of spot goods on the market, and rumors in this port did not stop. This was the only drawback. Yesterday morning, the rumors in this port were extremely serious. Lianhe, Shengda, Jiufeng, and Hongda sold heavily, and the market price fell to sixty yuan zero four corners. Then, Runli, Huikangle, and Maole absorbed strongly, and the price recovered slightly, but it was still three to five corners lower than the previous day. In the afternoon, Tongkang continued to buy, and Lianhe, Lianyi, Jiufeng, and Xinfu all hedged their positions. The market price suddenly turned bullish with a very strong momentum. After Class C broke through sixty-one yuan, it rose to two yuan, and Class A saw seventy yuan zero five points. All the rest also saw new highs. Although Hongda, Hengkang, Shengchang, Hengfu, and Dafeng had large sales, Yitai, Shengda, and retail investors bought up, and the closing price was only slightly two to three corners lower. The market price resulted in a new high across the board, an increase of four and a half corners to one yuan and one corner and five points. The total transaction volume was about 3.2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

The stock transaction was 100 shares of Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory stock, with a price of twenty-five yuan two corners and a half.

Yesterday, there were many transactions in the public utilities stock market. The opening prices of various well-known stocks were firm. After entering the market, there was some profit-taking. The stocks of International, British Union, Jardine Matheson, and Wheelock Marden had the largest fluctuations. Rubber stocks were also very popular.

Grain Imported Rice Arrived

Rice Prices Still Expected to Rise

Yesterday, another 3,433 bags of imported rice from Taikoo Company's Hunan Wheel, loaded from Hong Kong, arrived in Shanghai and were unloaded at the company's wharf in Pudong. Also, 2,495 bags loaded from Hong Kong by the Hanyang Wheel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (3rd) and were unloaded at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. Jardine Matheson's Yongsheng Wheel brought 630 bags from Hong Kong and was unloaded at the Roosevelt Wharf. The Bangkok ship, managed by the French company, directly transported more than 39,000 bags of imported rice and more than 54,000 bags of imported corn from Saigon, arriving at port at around 2:00 p.m. yesterday and being unloaded at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong. Yesterday, a total of 45,558 bags (Zu).

The imported rice market turned strong and popular again yesterday. Although a new transaction involved 500 tons of No. 1 Saigon rice, with an opening price of 74 yuan and a half, the goods could only be loaded from Haiphong because there were no ships available for loading in Saigon. It is said that orders could have been transacted in recent days, but because of the shortage of ships, transactions could not continue. Therefore, the market's sentiment is once again optimistic. The spot price of original packaged No. 2 Saigon rice opened at 72 yuan to 72 yuan and eight corners, an increase of one yuan compared to last week. Although the spot price of imported rice was weak in the morning market, it rebounded in the noon market and continued to be strong in the afternoon. As a result, it was about half a yuan higher than last Saturday. The total transaction volume for the day also increased to eight or nine thousand bags. The original package had three tons. It was estimated that No. 1 Saigon rice was 76 yuan and a half, 65 yuan and a half, No. 2 was 61 yuan and a half, 71 yuan, No. 2 Siamese rice was 69 yuan and two corners, 68 yuan and eight corners, fire-cooked rice was 64 yuan and two corners, 63 yuan and a half, special rice was 66 yuan, Xiaowen rice was 69 yuan, 68 yuan and a half, Tokyo next rice was 54 yuan and two corners, rice tea was 54 yuan and three corners, 54 yuan, next rice was 52 yuan and a half, broken rice was 51 yuan, next to 49 yuan, and Wuhu top rice was 59 yuan.

A total of 2,300 shi of new japonica rice and miscellaneous wild rice arrived, mostly from a certain place. Because the previous dynasty strongly promoted it, traders made a good profit and transported a lot of it, resulting in an unusual congestion. However, the sales market was small, so the kiln type market could not be maintained and depreciated by more than one yuan. The shop sales of new japonica rice were very strong, and although the goods arrived in large quantities, there was no change. Only wild rice was in short supply, and the price rose by one yuan. The price of Duyang top rice was not available due to lack of goods. The opening price of new japonica rice was 78 yuan and a half for the original package, 77 yuan for the next one, kiln type rice was 78 yuan, 77 yuan and a half, wild rice was 81 yuan, and the next one was 78 yuan and a half.

Both domestic and foreign glutinous rice have weakened day by day, which has aroused the motivation of food vendors and brewers. Therefore, foreign rice has become tight, and the situation is also more active. The market has increased by four or five corners. The opening price of Yili white rice was 75 yuan and six corners, Changdan was 75 yuan, 73 yuan and eight corners, and Hong Kong white rice was 72 yuan and a half, 71 yuan and a half.

Flour and Wheat Transactions Were Quiet

The market for existing flour remains flat and soft. The factory's No. 2 flour list remains unchanged. In addition to supplying retail sales in this street, wholesale sales are very quiet. The customer's list also remains unchanged at 18 yuan and five corners. After the returned goods of the old car brand loosened to 18 yuan and eight corners, because the entry of goods was quiet, it did not open for support. Foreign flour will arrive soon, and people are generally bearish. However, because the price of rice is firm and high, sellers are unwilling to sell at a discount. It is heard that the price of ordinary brands is similar to that of local flour, and high-end brands still require more than 19 yuan. A total of more than 10,000 bags were transacted in the market. In addition to the 8,000 bags sold by the factory, there were 2,000 bags of foreign flour. The market is still brewing.

There was no progress in wheat yesterday. This is because the arrival of goods from the interior has been quiet for a long time. Only a small number of wheat from nearby areas are occasionally transported, mostly designated for delivery to Japanese factories. The price remains at the original list. The transactions of Chinese factories and other exports are sluggish. There is only a bid price but no formal transaction in the market.

Yarn and Cotton
Hong Kong Merchants Purchased Single Yarn

Double Horse Still Saw Profit-Taking at High Prices

After the sharp drop in the yarn market, there was a slight recovery, but the actual transactions were still declining. However, Hong Kong merchants were more active in their demand for 32-count single yarn, so the market became slightly bullish. The exchange's market was also sluggish. It is likely that everyone will wait and see for the issue of receiving and delivering goods this month. The current market is still hesitant. Today, 315 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong, and 20 pieces were transported to Xiamen.

The morning opening price of existing yarn was stable, and everyone was eager to take long positions at low prices. The initial price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,180 yuan, up 10 yuan. After the price was high, the longs vomited again, and the market gradually declined, falling to 1,161 yuan. Even after the exchange rate slightly reduced and the gold price rebounded, the market slightly recovered, and the longs became active again, rising to 1,184 yuan. However, the actual transactions were still as bleak as usual. Profit-takers closed their positions, and the price loosened to 1,175-6 yuan. This situation occurred many times. The closing price was 1,178 yuan. It was found that the total transaction volume in half a day was 5,930 bales. The market price of 20-count Double Horse rose by eight yuan. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:

Same trade 5,500 Hong Kong 430

Total 5,930

Speculation in Cotton Yarn by Non-Professionals

Is Like Looking at Flowers in the Fog

Under the tug-of-war between the long and short sides of cotton yarn, the market price rises and falls suddenly, and the situation is treacherous and unpredictable. It is like looking at flowers in the fog. The consistent trick of those who are good at grabbing profits is to sell at high prices and cover at low prices. With a single turnover, they can make money quickly. What they welcome most is buying and selling cotton yarn on behalf of customers, because making money on "eating the list" is 100% sure. For example, the market price of Double Horse yarn is 1,187-8 yuan (the opening price on Saturday). If a customer wants to buy 10 or 20 pieces, it is nothing to make three or four yuan on each piece of yarn by buying with the market price. As for customers with a limit price who want to buy at around 1,180 yuan, the brokers in the industry can see the market and take advantage of the situation to buy at over 1,160 yuan (for example, the closing price on Saturday was only 1,168 yuan) and report to the customer that the market price is over 1,170 yuan. This is cheaper than the customer's limit price, and the customer who has fallen into the fog seems to feel that the broker is reliable and very satisfied! Even if the shrewd customer follows the broker to the market and mixes in the boiling, crowded, and confusing crowd, he is "blind" and cannot see the tricks. As for the decline in the yarn market following the increase in exchange rates, this is due to the panic of the people and the actions of those who are technically shorting the market. In fact, the cost and expenses of each piece of 20-count yarn from the yarn factory still need to be around 1,070 yuan. Looking at the yarn market, under the current real environment, it will not fall below the 1,100 yuan level, because those who are experienced in this business will cover at low prices, and the chips on the table will always be held tightly. They will not let it fall and will wait for the price to rise to a considerable level before releasing it! (Ju)

Cotton Market Remains Quiet

The current situation of cotton remains quiet and dull. This is because the yarn market is sluggish, and the factories' intentions are quiet. Therefore, there are few transactions. Although the industry is optimistic, there are few buyers, and the market has become stagnant. Today, 200 bales of cotton were transported to Hong Kong.

Another report: The price of foreign cotton in New York is quiet and firm. Later, due to the high price of stocks on Wall Street and the purchase by some banks, the closing price rose by four to five pounds compared to the previous day. The forecast for India fell by half a rupee or more.

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been exceptionally quiet recently. All parties are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. In addition, the yarn price has slightly declined, and the cotton market is becoming more sluggish. However, because the stock in the market is not abundant, the cotton price has not turned weak.

Piece Goods
Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Can Be Transported

"Removal Certificates" Have Been Received

Factory Cloth

Yesterday, the decline in the cotton yarn and Dong cloth markets slightly subsided, and people's minds gradually stabilized. Customer gangs began to purchase, and the industry also began to hedge their positions. The transaction volume suddenly increased, and the selling prices became quite chaotic. Colored cloth and bleached cloth were average. The price of coarse cloth from Yihua and other factories fell by two corners and a half, and the price of fine cloth and fine twill fell by two corners and a half to five corners. The price of Fugui fine cloth was the highest, once sold at 32 yuan. The price of fine twill was 30 yuan and five corners, which was absorbed by the industry. The transaction volume of various goods in this street was more than 500 pieces. The Jiangsu and Zhejiang gangs purchased more than 200 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and colored cloth. The Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs purchased more than 100 pieces of colored cloth and twill. The goods for domestic wholesale in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, which have received "removal certificates," continue to be shipped out. However, approval is not easy. Today, 55 pieces of piece goods were transported to Xiamen, and another 630 pieces were transported to Hong Kong.

Dong Cloth

The market first fell and then rose, and the market trend stabilized. This is because the price had fallen too sharply last week, and the small households had cleared their floating capital. The actual demand for dyed and blank goods in this street is still not weak. Therefore, the opening price of Longtou fine cloth in the morning market fell to 34 yuan and three corners. At that time, those who wanted to trade were optimistic and began to purchase again. The opening price in the afternoon market was 34 yuan and five corners, and the closing price was 34 yuan and six corners, an increase of one corner compared to the weekend.

Oil Cake
Manipulating the Oil Market

Cannot Withstand the General Trend

Yesterday, because the actual sales of the oil market were limited, and the Qingdao oil market was tired and short-lived, the excitement of the previous two days should have dissipated. Although the market was bustling with activity, the buying and selling were all speculative. Today, the line was quite tortuous. As a result, except for soybean oil, which was unchanged from the market price last weekend, the spot price of peanut oil slightly decreased by one yuan. However, the futures price has fallen by two yuan. It was estimated that more than 1,000 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were sold at a price of 73 yuan and a half to 72 yuan and seven corners and a half. At the close, 200 pieces were ordered for delivery in the lower part of November, with a price of 73 yuan and a half to 73 yuan. 100 pieces were delivered in the upper part of December, with a price of 74 yuan. 200 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were sold at a price of 101 yuan and seven corners and a half to zero seven corners and a half. 500 barrels were delivered in the lower part of November, with a price of 103 yuan to zero one yuan and two corners and a half. 700 barrels were delivered in the lower part of December, with a price of 104 yuan to one yuan and seven corners and a half. 20 barrels of Jiangbei raw oil were sold at a price of 101 yuan. More than 300 cans of local oil were sold at a price of 100 yuan. 500 cans of Yantai raw oil were also sold at a price of 100 yuan. Transactions of soybean oil included 50 pieces of Jiaozhou oil (the price is detailed in the market price column), 500 pieces of Yanqi oil, and 200 dan of Dayou factory oil.

1,225 bags of soybeans were exported to Xiamen on the 5th, and another 1,320 bags were exported to Hong Kong. 310 bags of sesame, 500 cans of sesame oil, 200 pieces of raw oil, and another 1,365 cans were all transported to Hong Kong. Also, 670 cans of raw oil and 50 cans of tea oil were transported to Xiamen. 4,999 bags of yellow wax arrived from Hong Kong on the 4th.

Sugar Market
Lower-Grade Sugar Slightly Increased

The sugar market trend remained stable yesterday, and the transaction volume was still small. However, the price of lower-grade sugar slightly increased. According to the association's list, the spot price of 24 coarse white sugar was 71 yuan and a half for the local warehouse and 71 yuan for the foreign warehouse. The price of transit goods was 56 yuan and a half. The spot price of Dutch red sugar was 54 yuan, and the price of European goods was 54 yuan and a half, with no significant changes. The price of Taikoo brand B sugar was slightly lower, at 70 yuan and a half. The price of lower-grade DY and HX brand sugar in the East Warehouse was the same, at 66 yuan, an increase of five corners. 4,600 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.

Hardware
Tinplate Remained Firm

The tinplate that has been holding firm and rising for a long time had a few boxes transacted yesterday. However, the demand from merchants in other ports has gradually become sluggish, and lock factories, machinery factories, and roller manufacturers are not very interested in buying. Therefore, there are only sporadic transactions in the market, and there are no wholesale transactions. Therefore, people's minds are still firm due to the shortage of spot goods. The estimated price of No. 24 goods yesterday was 1,100 yuan per box, and the price of No. 26 patterns was 550 yuan.

North and South Goods
Dried Lily Buds Remained Firm

The arrival of dried lily buds has not been much recently, and the stock in the market is not too thick. In addition, the price of production is very firm, so the trend is stable. Yesterday, it was heard that a number of Daxing dishes were offered at a price of 95 yuan, and Suqian dishes were offered at 88 yuan.

Medicinal Materials
Bitter Apricot Kernel Production Price Reported to Increase

The quoted price of bitter apricot kernels from the production area has increased compared to before. It is extremely difficult to make a profit, so the source is very scarce. The Shanghai market has become high. The current price of new goods is over 100 yuan, and the recent price is 105 yuan. The price of old goods is 95 yuan, but the sales are not very active, so the increase is relatively slow.

Coal

Coal Briquettes Insist on the Original Price

The Quality is Poor and Difficult to Ignite

The market price of coal briquettes was mostly expected to rise at the end of last month, and people hoarded them, hoping to sell them at a good price. However, as a result, the new goods from various factories, such as Hongji Coal Slurry, did not arrive, and they had to use inferior goods, such as Xinhong Slurry Coal Slurry, to meet the market demand. The factory list price remained unchanged (7 yuan and two corners per load for retail sales, 132 yuan per ton for the same industry). Therefore, most of the coal briquettes on the market recently are hard and difficult to ignite, which is due to the poor quality of the raw materials.
