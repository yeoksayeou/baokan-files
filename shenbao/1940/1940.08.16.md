Chongqing: According to a Chinese military spokesperson, Chinese and Japanese troops are currently engaged in fierce fighting on the border of southern Guangxi. On August 5th, the Chinese army occupied Shangjin, ten miles east of Xizhou, and drove out all the Japanese troops stationed there. To date, the Japanese army has not been able to reoccupy the area. The Japanese attempt to defeat the Chinese forces on all fronts has been hampered by the heavy floods in many rivers around Longzhou and Shangjin in the past week. These floods were caused by heavy rains. The spokesperson further stated that, according to military intelligence, the strength of the Japanese troops in Nanning and Longzhou had decreased significantly in the past week. The reports that the Japanese army had increased its garrison in these two cities were not true. The spokesperson also stated that, in North China, the Japanese army has not only cleared the grass in the fields along the railway tracks to a width of one mile, but also built barbed wire fences on both sides of the railway to prevent guerrillas from sabotaging traffic. Despite these precautions, a military train traveling from Qingdao was blown up twice in the past week, killing two Japanese soldiers. The barbed wire fence still cannot prevent guerrilla sabotage of the railway. (United Press dispatch of the 15th)

### Winter Clothing Donation Campaign to be Completed by the End of This Year
### National Winter Clothing Donation Committee Issues Circular Calling for Enthusiastic Donations from People at Home and Abroad

Chongqing: The General Association of the National Winter Clothing Donation Campaign Committee, in view of the imminent arrival of autumn and winter, urgently needs to promote this year's winter clothing donation campaign. It has been previously stipulated that the national donation campaign will begin simultaneously on August 15th, and will be completed within two and a half months before October 31st. The Committee has now issued a circular to compatriots at home and abroad, calling for a unified response and enthusiastic donations. The circular states in brief: "The hot summer is about to pass, and autumn is approaching in the blink of an eye. Every year when winter comes, we are warmly dressed and do not feel cold even when sitting by the stove, while millions of soldiers on the front lines are braving the cold in the frozen wilderness to engage in fierce battles, and displaced refugees are shivering and crying out in the cold. Their loyalty and courage are admired by all, and their dedication to the country is sympathized by the world. Since the 27th year of the Republic (1938), this Committee has repeatedly called for and launched the Winter Clothing Donation Campaign to be transferred to the soldiers on the front lines and the refugees. We are deeply indebted to our compatriots at home and abroad for their generous donations and enthusiastic contributions. In the past two years, we have collected more than seven million pieces of winter clothing, which have been distributed one by one. In the past two summers, we have also sewn more than 300,000 sets of summer clothing made of ramie cloth and 80,000 mosquito nets, which have been distributed to new recruits and wounded soldiers in various places. This Committee has decided to continue to launch this year's Winter Clothing Donation Campaign. However, based on past experiences, we deeply feel that transportation is inconvenient in various places, and the distribution of winter clothing is difficult. It is also difficult to ensure the uniformity of quality and style for clothing made separately in various places. Therefore, this year, we have decided to change to raising 10 million yuan in cash (6 million yuan domestically and 4 million yuan overseas), and to collect as many old clothes as possible. Based on the actual needs of various battlefields, we will separately request the military supply bureaus in various places to make and transfer the clothing, and request the affiliated agencies of the Western Relief Committee to distribute the collected old clothes to refugees in various places for relief. The donation campaign will begin on August 15th and will last for two and a half months, and must be completed by October 31st. We hope that everyone will take the lead, publicize widely, and respond enthusiastically in accordance with the principle of contributing money and effort, and make large donations."

### Wei Lihuang Discusses the Situation in Southern Shanxi

Chongqing: General Wei Lihuang, Commander of the Shanxi-Henan War Zone, recently told the press that the Japanese troops in southern Shanxi have already undertaken their tenth "suppression" campaign against the thousands of Chinese guerrillas in Zhongtiao Mountain, but the result is still unsuccessful, and they have retreated to their defensive cities. General Wei stated that Zhongtiao Mountain is a fortress for defending against the Japanese troops in southern Shanxi. The mountain is sufficient to protect the thousands of Chinese guerrillas who harass the Japanese troops and prevent the weary Japanese troops from penetrating deeply. The Japanese 11th "suppression" campaign resulted in the loss of 200,000 men. Currently, the Japanese have only their 12th Division, which has been reinforced 27 times. General Wei also stated that he believes that the Japanese military strength in North China does not allow them to attack Free China to the west. The Japanese claim that they want to attack southern Shaanxi along the Han River and move towards Gansu to cut off international routes is nothing more than a fantasy. To carry out this plan, the Japanese would have to deploy countless divisions, but at present, every Japanese soldier in North China has to fight against the guerrillas, and he does not know how they can mobilize a large army to advance west.

### Control Yuan Seeks to Improve Commissioned Investigations
### Plans to Draft Measures for Commissioned Investigations
### To Give People More Opportunities to Seek Redress

Chongqing: The Control Yuan's investigation of cases is divided into two categories: dispatched investigations and commissioned investigations. In the past six months, a total of more than 500 written complaints have been received. Among them, matters that are not within the scope of the Yuan's responsibilities and those that are factually incorrect will not be accepted and will be filed after review and approval. For all other cases, the Yuan cannot send personnel to investigate all of them, and a portion is commissioned to other agencies for investigation. Fearing that the commissioned agencies cannot provide accurate answers, which may result in the people's suffering or the inability to fully seek redress, the Yuan is now seeking to improve this work and plans to draft measures for commissioned investigations, so that the commissioned investigation agencies have a basis to rely on, in order to achieve the effect of supervision.

Editorial

### America in a Dangerous Period

U.S. Representative Carlsen yesterday asked Secretary of the Navy Knox during a hearing before the House Military Affairs Committee, "Is there a danger of the United States participating in the Far Eastern war?" Knox replied, "In this dangerous period, no one knows." Such a question and answer does not seem to offer any concrete new enlightenment: however, the firm grasp of its established national policy by American political authorities, the recognition of the seriousness of the Far Eastern situation, and the understanding that American participation in the Far Eastern war is possible at any time, are all revealed in this question and answer.

Does the United States have ways to implement its national policy other than engaging in war? Does the United States have the power to maintain its interests other than engaging in war? If it is said that war can be avoided, then where are the effective methods? If it is said that war is inevitable, then where is the opportune moment? Regarding all these questions, there are likely to be some differing views among Americans; at least, as of today, it is still difficult to obtain a unanimous answer. To attempt to encourage Americans today to unanimously advocate immediate entry into the war, or to attempt to coerce Americans to unanimously advocate abandoning their interests and withdrawing from the Far East, is bound to be futile. It is said that when the British Ambassador to the United States visited the U.S. State Department regarding the issue of withdrawing British troops stationed in China, he offered some suggestions regarding the responsibilities that the United States should assume in the Far East in the future; the authorities coldly replied that the United States has its own ideas and does not need others to meddle. What is said may not be exactly true, but since American national policy is extremely firm, and American general customs and habits, stemming from a sense of self-respect, deeply abhor propaganda, disdain lobbying, and are happy to hear various views without much judgment and to make their own judgments; then the coldness of the U.S. State Department, as reported, is truly a typical American spirit. Even the Secretary of the Navy's reply to the Congressman, avoiding definitive words, also captures the essence of American politics. Americans are still pained by President Wilson's participation in the First World War and the victory, up to the failure of the Fourteen Points; the reaction to this pain is the rise of isolationist theory; the lesson of this pain is the caution of general attitudes; and politicians with true insight have also learned from this and not only avoid mentioning the so-called parallel action or group action in the international arena, but also fear to do so. They diligently work day and night to relentlessly uphold what they believe, determine their choices, improve their strength, strive for complete security, and then choose the most reasonable path, the most appropriate moment, and proceed step by step, acting independently to achieve their goals. The repeated measures taken by the United States to deal with the Far Eastern situation in the past three years have all been like this, as can be reviewed.

As for the future, the United States has its most ideal standard, that is, by 1946, six years from now, the large naval expansion plan can be completed, and it can simultaneously cope with changes in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans without worry. However, this does not mean that the current crisis is predetermined, nor does it mean that nothing can be done until six years have passed. At present: preparing a great army to compensate for the current inadequacy of the navy to simultaneously deal with two oceans is the reason for the mandatory conscription bill proposed by the U.S. government, this is one point. In the Atlantic, it sympathizes with Britain and hopes that Britain will not fail. However, the naval power of Germany and Italy is far inferior to that of the United States, so even if Britain unfortunately fails, Germany and Italy, after fierce battles, will not pose any immediate threat to the United States in reality; what is to be prepared for is only the air and the land; this is the second point. In the Pacific, the United States has already been threatened directly and indirectly. The Secretary of the Navy believes that we are already in a dangerous period; the stability of the Pacific depends on the navy, so the main force of the U.S. Navy remains stationed in the Pacific; this is the third point. How has it already been threatened? In the Hawaiian Islands, the United States is aware of the activities of the Fifth Column from the Far East in the islands; in the mandated islands around the Marshall Islands, the United States is aware that the islands have been equipped with military facilities in violation of the agreement; in the Philippine Islands, it is said that some political figures are trying to befriend strong neighbors as a way out of their political situation; all these facts are widely reported in the American newspapers and are well known to the general American public. Furthermore, because China has been invaded, the interests of the United States in China are almost non-existent; what can be relied on is either China's victory in the war of resistance, or the United States using its strength to maintain its own interests. Furthermore, with the threat to French Indochina and the coveting of the Dutch East Indies, this is a situation in which they are trapped as part of the "East Asian Economic Sphere." If this becomes a reality, then the American Philippines, located between Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies, will undoubtedly be at the mercy of others; and those who threaten and covet are currently openly advocating and striving to advance this reality, and the signs of this are clearly visible. Therefore, it can be said that a "dangerous period" has indeed arrived. If the United States does not quickly plan effective measures to implement its national policy and maintain its interests, then there will be no room to deny the so-called "danger of participating in the Far Eastern war"; what "no one knows" is only the timing.

### Knox, U.S. Secretary of the Navy, Declares: America is Watching the Crisis in Both Oceans; Navy Expansion Requires Six Years to Complete; Three Reserve Bases to be Built Immediately

Washington - Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox told the House Military Affairs Committee yesterday that he believes that once Britain falls, a U.S.-German conflict may begin. He predicted that after Britain's defeat, Germany would immediately extend its economic reach to South America. If Germany were to gain military bases in Latin America, the seriousness of the situation would be difficult to resolve. Colonel Knox refused to directly answer a question about the possibility of the United States going to war with Japan, but said, "I believe we are living in a very dangerous time, and no one can predict where an attack will come from." He also said, "There is a dangerous possibility that our potential enemies in the Pacific might reach an understanding with our potential enemies in the Atlantic." Such an alliance could harm the United States. He declared, "If we had a navy of three million tons now, there is no doubt that we would be able to control the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but our navy, which is expanding, cannot be completed until 1946." Colonel Knox pointed out that if Britain were ultimately defeated, Germany would control all shipbuilding industries, and its rate would be much faster than that of the United States. The Secretary of the Navy also reiterated the budget, saying that the United States needs 300,000 regular troops, and the proposal to supplement them with a national guard was submitted to Congress before France's defeat. He said that two years ago, after returning from South America, he deeply believed that the only way to defend the United States was to adopt the "Hemispheric Defense Law." When discussing the Panama Canal, he said, "Our country's most important foreign connection is in foreign territories." He also said that he had seen Germany sacrifice a huge amount of money to establish an airline on the Amazon River in Brazil. Finally, he said, "I asked why, and it was said that the airline could allow them to reach the Panama Canal from the upper reaches of the Amazon River in five hours." (United Press, 15th)

Washington - Washington officials feel that the outcome of the English Channel battle is also related to the fate of the Americas, so they are paying close attention to this war, and regard domestic issues as secondary. They hope that the British air force can continue to demonstrate its superiority. A political reporter for the Washington Post said that the fate of not only the British Empire but also all free people in the world is tied to this battle. The Baltimore Sun said that the war is now moving towards a new and terrifying extreme. Germany is deploying a major strike, and its success or failure is unknown, depending on whether it encounters strong resistance from resolute people. As Germany's blitzkrieg has begun, people are inevitably worried. Some quarters here believe that President Roosevelt will soon take action on the sale of destroyers to Britain. It is said that someone has already tested the opinions of members of Congress on this matter on behalf of the President. (Reuters, 15th)

Washington - U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox said last night that the U.S. Navy will build three reserve bases immediately, and there are 13 other bases that are being expanded. These bases will be used as training grounds for 1,600 reserve officers. (United Press International, 15th)

New York - Thomas, a Republican member of the New Jersey State Assembly, said today that Puerto Rico is likely to experience serious rebellion due to German and Spanish conspiracies. Thomas, a member of Congress, has just returned from a visit to the Caribbean to inspect U.S. defenses. He urged the U.S. and Puerto Rican authorities to take immediate action to stop it before it becomes unmanageable. (International News Service, 15th)

Enlistment Act Amendment Passed; Army Soldiers' Pay Improved

Washington - The Senate passed an amendment to the Enlistment Act yesterday, which will allow U.S. Army soldiers to receive monthly pay from US$21 to US$30, so that the Army and Navy can receive equal treatment. At the same time, the Enlistment Act caused a strong debate in the Senate. It is rumored that a certain Senate leader told President Roosevelt that although the bill had been strongly debated, it would eventually pass in the middle of next week. At the same time, Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox urged the implementation of the Enlistment Act in the Military Affairs Committee. He said, "The United States is now encountering the most serious crisis in its history. Once Britain is defeated (I hope this will not become a reality), we will have no friends on earth." Colonel Knox said that there is a reason why the United States needs the Enlistment Act. The first reason is to make American youth always have "the mentality that to preserve freedom, one must sacrifice." The second reason is that since the country "spends so much money" to purchase armaments, we should fully train the people and teach them how to use them. At the same time, President Roosevelt wrote to Federal Security Administrator McNutt, saying that he advises college students that their most important patriotic duty is not to enlist in the Army and Navy or find jobs in military industrial plants, but to continue their studies. The President said, "The decision to leave school would be unfortunate. We urgently need well-educated and intelligent citizens to deal with today's difficult situation." (United Press International, 15th)

Washington - U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox declared to the House Military Affairs Committee yesterday that Britain would collapse within 60 days. The information the United States has about the attack on Britain is not accurate. The U.S. conscription bill must be passed, because after Britain's defeat, the world will have no allies of the United States, although it is hoped that Britain will not reach this point. (Haitong News Agency, 15th)

Washington - Nelson, the production advisor to the U.S. National Defense Committee, said yesterday that the U.S. Army can have 1.2 million fully equipped men by the end of 1942, and it is estimated that it will take another nine months to equip 2 million men. (Reuters, 15th)

Attitude of U.S. Republican Senators and Representatives on the National Guard Bill

Washington - U.S. Representative Miller, a Republican from Connecticut, proposed an amendment to the National Guard Mobilization Act yesterday, arguing that the deployment of the National Guard should be limited to the U.S. mainland, U.S. islands, Alaska, the Panama Canal Zone, and the Philippines, and said that the original plan would allow President Roosevelt to dispatch the National Guard to any place in the Americas. In the Senate, Senator Taft, a Republican from Ohio, launched a fierce attack on Secretary of War Stimson, Assistant Secretary of War Patterson, New York Times publisher Ochs, and other members of the military training camp association who supported the conscription bill, calling them warmongers and attempting to build a huge army that the United States does not need. He said that Stimson, Patterson, and others are engaged in extensive national propaganda, clearly intending to exert pressure on Congress. Taft said that the total number of troops desired by Sheppherd on the Senate Military Affairs Committee was only 700,000. A huge army would cost the United States a huge sum of US$350 billion. He also said, "We should not exaggerate the current dangerous situation. I believe that even if we want to cope with the threat of an all-powerful nation, we do not need to turn ourselves into an all-powerful nation." Taft said that it is absolutely impossible to protect Argentina, Brazil, and other South American countries with only one army. The Monroe Doctrine should be implemented by the Navy. If it cannot be implemented by the Navy, then this doctrine is completely impossible to implement. He also said that Roosevelt's administration would certainly hope to use our country's army to defend countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. He supported building a huge navy, saying, "I quite agree that our country should have a navy in the Atlantic sufficient to repel European aggression, and a navy in the Pacific sufficient to repel Japanese aggression. I believe that our country's current navy has sufficient power to move back and forth to defend against attacks from both oceans. If we can implement the Monroe Doctrine, we should have a navy as prepared as we are now." He concluded by saying that he was very skeptical as to whether Japan would attempt to invade the United States. (United Press International, 15th)

### British Parliamentarian Advocates Embargo Against Japan; House of Commons Debated the Issue of Blocking Burma

London - During yesterday's meeting of the House of Commons, Liberal MP Mander questioned Under-Secretary of State Butler, saying that in view of Britain's closure of the Burma Road and refusal to transport oil and other materials needed for the war to China, would Japan be allowed to continue transporting them, and regarding this matter, should the government consider the U.S. ban on oil exports to Japan? Butler replied that he had no comment to make at this time. Mander asked again whether the government understood that continuing to transport military materials to Japan would be tantamount to sanctioning the aggressor and aiding the aggressor. Butler replied that the questioner might be satisfied to know that the government constantly kept all aspects of this issue in mind. Labor MP Noel-Baker then asked whether the government had considered adopting the American principle, which was important because the war might be prolonged and Britain should store as much of this material as possible for its own use. Butler replied that Britain's own needs were the most important. (Reuters, 15th)

### British Relief Team Leader Arrives in Chongqing with Members

Chongqing - The leader of the British Relief Team in Central China, Barker (Professor of Asian History at the University of Bristol), and other team members, Mr. Tett and Mr. Sullivan, have arrived here and will pay visits to government leaders. The team has a total of six people, including two mechanical personnel.

The disaster victims are supporting the old and carrying the young, fleeing the disaster. Unexpectedly, they were captured in large numbers and forced to build dikes around the city. On the night of July 12, there was heavy rain, and the upstream river water converged and rushed down, passing over the dike by several feet, as fast as an arrow. The dike was washed away, and the disaster victims were driven into the floodwaters, which was unspeakably tragic. (15th dispatch)

Tokyo - According to a Japanese news report from Kaifeng, several breaches have occurred in the Yellow River dikes, and thousands of villagers in Central China have drowned.

### National Government Implements Price Controls

Chongqing - The National Government is now taking effective measures to control prices and ensure the proper distribution of food and daily necessities, while also adjusting the national economic life in wartime. In addition to establishing a National Food Control Office, the Executive Yuan has recently decided to strictly prohibit hoarding of food and daily necessities. Violators will be sentenced to death for endangering national survival. The government has also decided to unify all anti-smuggling agencies. Previously, this anti-smuggling work was handled by various agencies attached to the customs of the Ministry of Finance and military authorities. In the future, all of these activities will be handled by a central agency, but details have not yet been released. At the same time, in order to curb extravagant lifestyles and prevent the outflow of funds due to the purchase and import of luxury goods, the public has been notified that various imported luxury goods stored in shops in Free China must be sold within three months (i.e., by the end of October). After the deadline, the government will take over these stocks and sell them at official prices. The list of luxury goods contains hundreds of items. The Chongqing Municipal Government has now established sales outlets to sell daily necessities and food at prices much lower than those on the market. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has allocated 15,000 tons of coal to the outlets for sale. (Reuters, 15th)

### Li Hanhun Discusses New Measures in Guangdong

Chongqing - A reporter visited Li Hanhun, Chairman of Guangdong Province, on the 15th and asked about the new policies implemented in Guangdong recently. He said the following: In terms of military affairs, Guangdong Province has won two major victories in the past two years, which is due to the good fighting of the soldiers, but the cooperation of the people is also very important. Now is the busy farming season, and soldiers everywhere have actively participated in field work, which has greatly helped the harvest. This can be seen as a manifestation of the spirit of military-civilian cooperation. In terms of economy, at the beginning of my term, I was determined to accelerate the development of agriculture and industry in Guangdong Province, which can assist the military and stabilize the people's livelihood. Up to now, the following tasks are still being actively promoted: (1) Increasing agricultural production; (2) Improving handicrafts; (3) Promoting cooperative enterprises and strictly stabilizing prices; (4) Promoting rural loans. The above work has made good progress, so the lives of the military and civilians are very stable. In terms of politics, the most important measure at present is to implement the new county system and ban opium addiction ahead of schedule. The opium ban was completed at the end of June, which is gratifying to the people of the country. In short, since Guangdong was invaded, it initially felt threatened geographically and economically. After more than two years of hard struggle, everything has embarked on the road to recovery and prosperity. (15th dispatch)

### Easing of German Air Offensive; British Planes Raid German and Italian Territories Extensively; Two of Italy's Largest Aircraft Factories Reported Bombed; Search for German Paratroopers in England Yields Nothing

London: German air raids on England have now greatly subsided, while the British Air Force, on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, launched the largest attack on enemy territory since the start of the war. In addition to heavily bombing German aircraft and munitions production centers, they soared over the Alps, a journey of approximately 1,600 miles, and heavily damaged two of Italy's most important aircraft factories: the Caproni factory in Milan and the aircraft factory in Turin. According to the Air Ministry's intelligence department, this was the first British air raid on Italy in a long time, evidently unexpected by the Italians. As a result, the anti-aircraft batteries were thrown into confusion, and their fire was sparse and scattered. The Air Ministry stated that the British planes hit their targets in the Italian aircraft factories, and the railway west of the Turin aircraft factory and the railway junction south of the city were also bombed. Hangars at the airfield next to the factory and the slipway of the seaplane station were also hit by high-explosive bombs, causing large fires to break out quickly. When British planes attacked German territory, the Junkers aircraft factory in Dessau, within sixty miles of Berlin, the main German aircraft production center, was bombed for over an hour, causing considerable damage. The Junkers auxiliary aircraft factory and airfield, as well as many munitions factories, in Bernburg, twenty miles away, were heavily bombed, catching fire and exploding, causing significant damage. A total of fourteen airfields in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France were attacked. (Reuters, 15th)

Milan: A supplementary report on the British air raid on Milan on Tuesday night, recently announced here, states that most of the bombs fell in workers' residential areas. Two bombs fell near the printing press of "Il Popolo d'Italia," creating a deep crater in the road. The glass windows of nearby houses were shattered, but the newspaper's editorial work was not interrupted, so the paper was published as usual. (Haitong, 15th)

Nine German Planes Shot Down Yesterday

London: According to current information, a total of nine German planes were shot down today. There was intense aerial activity this afternoon over the northeast coast of England, with large numbers of Spitfire and Hurricane planes appearing and disappearing in the clouds, engaging with enemy planes.

(Reuters, 15th)

German Planes Attack Dover Barrage Balloons

Berlin: According to a statement from the Air Ministry and the Internal Security Department, the barrage balloons over Dover were attacked by German planes. A lightship was also attacked by six German planes, each dropping two bombs, killing two crew members and wounding several others. The survivors boarded other ships, and the lightship soon sank. Hurricane fighters took off to intercept, shooting down one German bomber into the sea, and the remaining planes fled back to France. In addition, German dive bombers attacked an airfield in Kent but failed, and two were shot down. German planes in several other locations were met with fierce attacks by British fighters, suffering considerable losses. Yesterday afternoon, several areas in southeastern and southwestern England were also subjected to sporadic attacks. High-explosive bombs hit Southampton, slightly damaging a train and injuring several people. A house in Hastings was destroyed by bombing, killing and injuring some people. In addition to the seventeen German planes shot down by British Air Force fighters in England, three were shot down by anti-aircraft fire, bringing the total to twenty. British planes are constantly in action but have lost only four, one of whose pilots has been rescued. Of the twelve German twin-engine bombers that swooped down to bomb southeastern England yesterday, at least three were shot down, and it is presumed that another one crashed into the sea before reaching its destination. (Reuters, 15th)

Berlin: The primary target of the German Air Force's attacks today was the barrage balloons around Dover. The British defenses were very strong, and several air battles took place. However, German dive bombers broke through the defenses, and the attacked targets suffered no damage. (Haitong, 15th)

A Port on the Southeast Coast of England: When German raiders shot down an anti-aircraft balloon yesterday, a reporter narrowly escaped injury. The reporter was aiming his camera at the sky to film when the anti-aircraft balloon was suddenly hit and fell in front of him in a flash of light. At that moment, another photographer shouted, "Look out!" The wires of the balloon were already hissing past his ears. The reporter was standing on a cliff, watching the formation of German planes passing by. Every time a plane flew low, the coastal anti-aircraft batteries fired in rapid succession. When the German planes came out of the clouds and began to destroy the balloon, an anti-aircraft shell passed over his head, and the raiders had already safely flown out to sea. (United Press, 15th)

German Parachutes Discovered in England

London: The Internal Security Department states that there is no evidence of paratroopers landing in England or Scotland. After the department received reports of aircraft parachutes being discovered in two areas of England and one area of Scotland, the military police and Home Guard immediately mobilized and launched a large-scale search, which is still ongoing. However, no paratroopers have been found, nor is there any evidence that paratroopers have landed. After an enemy aircraft parachute was discovered in the Midlands yesterday morning, the military police and Home Guard not only carried out a major search but also took other precautions, deploying additional guards on roads throughout the area. According to a farmer in the area, a parachute was found near his field, but no one was seen, leading some to suspect that this was a German ruse. Parachutes were also found in a village ball field and in the flower bushes next to a house. Prior to this, aircraft activity in the area had been continuous for several hours. The night before, a huge plane appeared in the skies over Scotland, and yesterday, sixteen opened parachutes were found in various locations and handed over to the military authorities. However, there are no reports of any paratroopers being captured. (Reuters, 15th)

London: Yesterday, a guard unit in a town in central England reported by telephone that a gray object had been spotted in the air. The church bells in the villages rang loudly, warning the people that German paratroopers had landed in central England. After the warning was issued, armored car units and truck police squads carrying "Bren" machine guns, along with villagers carrying rifles and old-fashioned weapons, searched for German paratroopers. As of yesterday morning, no paratroopers had been found. A company commander of the guard unit stated that a warning had been issued at midnight, saying, "A large object has been spotted in the sky. The search went on late, and a parachute was discovered. However, the British did not shoot at the parachute because they did not initially know that the object in the air was a parachute." Many believe that the parachutes are a new method used by the Germans to cause panic. (United Press, 15th)

Berlin: This afternoon, the German war report stated that the primary target of German submarines was a British auxiliary cruiser (17,000 tons) sunk in the Atlantic. Although the weather was poor yesterday, German planes continued to attack British ports and industrial facilities, airfields, military camps, etc., with the Midlands and southern England being particularly targeted. The munitions factories between Brighton and Lewes were heavily bombed, and the munitions factories in Uckfield and Salisbury were also attacked.

### Hitler Disappointed in Attacking England

London: Today, all London newspapers recalled that after the fall of Paris, German propagandists had set August 15 as the day Hitler would triumphantly enter London. The editorial in the Daily Telegraph stated, "Today is the day the Germans falsely claimed that Hitler would dictate peace terms in London. If this rumor is indeed true, then Germany's failure to fulfill it should forever dispel the notion that Hitler is punctual." The article also mentioned that the German planes had been attacking England since last Thursday, saying that Hitler considered this to be the first step in launching a decisive blow, naturally hoping to destroy our ports, factories, and airfields, deplete our air defenses, which are slightly weaker in numbers, and crush the courage of our civilians. "If Hitler harbors this goal, then the results of the first week of large-scale air raids must have greatly disappointed him. The German planes that participated in the battle outnumbered the British planes, but their losses far exceeded ours. This has made our dominance of the skies unquestionable. The German communiqué is habitually deceptive, and Hitler is even more brazen in his attempts to cover up the truth, which is clearly visible." The Daily Mail stated, "Regardless of what extravagant claims Hitler makes about invading England, Britain has already won the first round of the war. Our seas are now strewn with the wreckage of Nazi planes and the hopes of the Nazis." (Reuters, 15th)

Rome: According to news from Africa last night, Italian Savoia and Marchetti bombers, escorted by several Fiat fighters, had bombed the left flank of the British defenses around Berbera last night. Whether the Italian infantry will be able to break through the British lines and establish new positions near Berbera will depend on the situation in the next 24 hours. The war in British Somaliland has been quiet for the past 72 hours, but it seems to have reached a decisive point last night. The final result should be seen in the next 48 hours.

(United Press, 15th)

Rome: Authoritative sources declared last night that the British Red Sea Fleet is preparing to take offensive naval action in an attempt to relieve the Italian pressure on Berbera, the capital of British Somaliland. According to reports received last night, British ships anchored in the Gulf of Aden suddenly sailed to an unknown location.

Regardless of the reports, the communications from Africa last night all stated that the British Red Sea Fleet had sailed to an unknown destination, and most reports stated that the British naval action was directly related to the Italian infantry's continued attack on British Somaliland. (United Press, 15th)

London: Reviewing the British Air Force's performance in the Middle East fighting against the Italians since June 19, it can be said that the British pilots and aircraft are superior to the enemy.

### Under Severe Italian Oppression, Greece Seeks Aid from Turkey; Italian Newspapers Vigorously Criticize the Greek Government; Greek Cruiser Helle Sinks After Being Hit by Torpedo

Vienna: It is rumored that Italy has issued a new protest against Greece for assisting Britain, causing a tense situation in Athens today. It is said that Greek Prime Minister General Metaxas, after receiving the diplomatic note, immediately requested Turkey to provide military assistance to Greece in the event of an Italian invasion. What kind of response Turkey will give is currently unknown, but observers predict that the Turkish government will give very serious consideration to the current situation. According to reports, Greece and Turkey, together with Romania and Yugoslavia, signed a non-aggression pact on February 9, 1934, which is still in effect. (International Telegraph, 15th)

Istanbul: A Turkish nationalist newspaper stated that Italy is blaming Greece for the assassination of Albanian nationalist Haki Shehu, which is causing unease in Turkey. The Balkan countries are divided due to land disputes, and Italy is using the Albanian incident as a reason to increase its troops in Albania. Readers should not forget the events of Corfu Island in 1923. Today, this island has considerable military value to Italy, so it is doubtful whether there is a real rebellion in Albania, or whether this move by Italy is a manipulative tactic. (Reuters, 15th)

Rome: Rome Radio continues the official Italian intimidation campaign against Greece. The station's reporter declared that Greece continues to commit atrocities against the Albanian minority. (Reuters, 15th)

Athens: Greek King George met with Prime Minister Metaxas yesterday to hear a report on the increasingly tense relations between Greece and Italy after the assassination of Albanian Haki Shehu. Greek diplomats stationed in various countries have been very active in recent days.

Rome: According to the "Messaggero," diplomatic figures from Italy and Greece are actively working to eliminate the crisis in Italo-Greek relations. The Italian ambassador to Greece held important talks with Greek Prime Minister Metaxas yesterday. Metaxas also met with German Ambassador Schoenburg. At the same time, the Greek ambassador to Turkey visited Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu to inquire whether the Turkish government recognizes that the Greek-Turkish mutual assistance agreement remains in effect. The Greek ambassador to the Soviet Union has visited Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov, requesting that the Soviet Union advise Bulgaria not to take advantage of the current tension between Italy and Greece to demand Thessaloniki and Aegean seaports from Greece. (Haitong News Agency, 15th)

Rome: Italian newspapers continued to write articles criticizing Greece yesterday. Some newspapers were particularly harsh. The newspapers severely criticized Greece's policies toward Albanians in the Greek region of Epirus, which aimed to deprive them of their nationality. Famous Italian journalist Gaeta published an article in "Italian News" stating that Albanians make up an absolute majority of the residents in the six districts along the Greek-Albanian border. The population of the six districts totals 168,203, of which Albanians account for 99,995, or 60% of the total population. However, the remaining 40% is not entirely Greek; there are also Bulgarians and other national minorities. Responsible officials here claim that the Albanian border incident, the assassination of Albanian Haki Shehu, has created a "delicate situation." "New Voice of Italy" continued, saying that the "criminal and hostile" behavior of the Greek newspapers is not welcome. The world welcomes the revival of Greece, but Greece should not suppress other ethnic groups to realize its revival. (Haitong Telegram, 15th)

Berlin: Officials here declared yesterday that Germany's attitude toward the Italo-Greek incident involving the assassination of Albanian Haki Shehu should be based on the fact that Italy is Germany's ally. Regarding disputes between Italy and third countries, we should evaluate them in the context of the alliance. If there are two views, then the Italo-Greek incident is only indirectly related to Germany. Today, Italy's view is not only to make Greece, but also to make the whole world know that the Albanian issue is an integral part of Italy's entire policy. (Haitong Telegram, 15th)

Athens: It is officially declared that the Greek cruiser Helle (2,115 tons) anchored half a mile from the breakwater off the Greek island of Tinos in the Aegean Sea.

### British War Minister Eden Reports on the War Situation; Britain Actively Expands Its Strength; The Real War Has Not Yet Begun

London: War Minister Eden said on London radio last night that the day Britain takes the offensive and strikes directly into enemy territory will be the day the war truly begins for Britain. This is Britain's method of winning the war and what Britain must do. German propaganda has said that the war will be over in the summer of 1940, but we do not believe so. For us, the real war in which the British Empire can exert its full strength has not yet begun. Sea power is a more powerful weapon than land power, as has been proven before, and will continue to be so in the future. Germany knows this very well, but hopes to overcome this difficulty by dominating the skies in this war. However, superior sea power combined with a rapidly expanding air force is ultimately invincible. This is Britain's position today and the reason why final victory belongs to us and not the enemy. We have a superior navy, a superior air force, and a land army that is growing stronger every day, and we will surely achieve our goal of victory. When we attack in the future, Hitler's Fifth Column will no longer be found, and Hitler will have nowhere to find friends, because the people of all countries that have been ravaged by him will rise up. Speaking of the post-war world, Eden said that we are determined not to let the post-war world remain as it was before the war, and will never allow a third European war to occur in our time or in the time of our descendants. We will not adopt any plans for halfway concessions or bribing enemy countries to subdue them, but will adopt a perfect method to allow free nations to share peace based on the principles we believe to be just and faithful. Eden continued to talk about British defense, saying that 500,000 people have been drafted and trained since May this year, and in addition to the British army, there are also troops from the Dominions and allied countries, all prepared to make the first victorious counterattack when the enemy invades. Britain's preparations in terms of manpower and material resources are increasing every day. The number of domestic militias alone has reached more than 1.5 million. He is convinced that Britain can not only defend but also attack. (Reuters, 15th)

### Romanian-Bulgarian Negotiations Encounter Setbacks; Hungarian-Romanian Negotiations to Be Held Soon

The Romanian Foreign Minister stated to the Bulgarian Ambassador that if Bulgaria is willing to abandon its claim to the cities of Silistra and Bazargic, the Romanian authorities are willing to resolve the issue of Dobruja. The Bulgarian Ambassador replied that the Bulgarian government has repeatedly reviewed this issue and cannot agree to any compromise solution. Bulgarian officials declared that the Bulgarian government will not take any further steps until Romania recognizes the principles claimed by Bulgaria. (Haitong Telegram, 15th)

How long they will stay in Severin will depend on the outcome of the negotiations. The procedures for the negotiations were agreed upon by the two governments a few days ago. The Hungarian government is currently keeping silent about its hopes for the negotiations. (Haitong News Agency, 15th)

### Dutch East Indies Adopts New Methods to Defend Oil Fields

Bandung: An Associated Press reporter recently learned from official sources here that the manpower and military equipment for the defense of the Dutch East Indies have been greatly increased in oil-producing areas. Previously, there were various defense plans in these areas to destroy oil wells, oil depots, and various equipment in the event of an invasion. Under the government's new plan, invaders must have a strong military force to carry out an attack. Army officials declared that the latest oil field destruction technology can destroy the largest oil depots, oil wells, and equipment in a matter of minutes. Officials also said that during the last World War, Germany could repair the destroyed Romanian oil fields and start extracting oil within a few days, but if the oil fields in the Dutch East Indies are destroyed now, it will take an extremely long time to recover. An army officer told the Associated Press reporter that if the "enemy" who relies on the supply of oil from the Dutch East Indies attacks the Dutch East Indies, the result will be that they will not be able to obtain oil supplies for a very long time. He also said that there is no fear of Fifth Column activities here, because the lessons learned by the Netherlands have been kept firmly in mind. (Associated Press, 15th)

Tokyo: The Japanese newspapers are paying close attention to the meeting between Prime Minister Konoe and the generals. The "Kokumin Shimbun" believes that, based on changes in the world situation and changes in Japanese foreign policy, the Japanese government will take certain decisive diplomatic steps. The vague attitude of Britain and the United States forces Japan to make a decision. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" said that Japan has suffered for three years and can no longer tolerate it. It will cancel foreign concessions in the areas of China that have been occupied. The "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun" said that the talks between Japanese generals and the Prime Minister were specifically held to discuss issues between Japan, Britain, the United States, the Dutch East Indies, and Vietnam, and were based on the Greater East Asia policy. (Haitong Telegram, 15th)

Hong Kong: Tokyo dispatch, the Minseito Party convened a general meeting of party members at 2:00 p.m. today, at which it was decided to dissolve the party. The party was founded in 1927 by the merger of the Kenseikai and the Seiyu Honto. Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has implemented a multi-party political system and a system of freedom of association. The Minseito Party was the mainstay of this traditional spirit. Observers generally believe that with the Minseito Party announcing its dissolution, Japan's old history can be said to have come to an end, and a new page will be opened. (Telegraph, 15th)

### Defense Meeting Held Yesterday; Resolutions to Be Announced This Morning; The United States Firmly Insists on Deploying Troops in the Central District; The Date of British Troop Withdrawal Has Not Been Determined

People in the local Chinese and foreign communities are deeply concerned about the Foreign Defense Forces Commanders' meeting, which was held at the Municipal Council meeting room at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. However, the results of the meeting were not announced and will not be released until 9:00 a.m. today. The meeting lasted for four hours, and at 2:00 p.m., the chairman of the meeting, Rear Admiral Takeda, Commander of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces, led the participants to an adjacent room for refreshments. The news reporters and photographers who gathered in front of the Municipal Council building yesterday were greatly disappointed because the army commanders who attended the meeting yesterday avoided meeting with news reporters and photographers.

According to information obtained by this newspaper this morning, the meeting yesterday reached a considerable stage of resolution. Generally, the defense of the central district of the International Settlement will be taken over by the United States Marine Corps, while the area north of the Suzhou Creek and the western district and the area around Great Western Road will be handed over to the Japanese army, but confirmation is still pending.

Central District Should Be Taken Over by American Troops

According to information from well-informed American community leaders last night, the United States is closely monitoring the progress of the British troop withdrawal. Regarding the issue of adjusting the British troop defense area, the American community believes that the central district of Shanghai is an area where British and American commerce converge, and all rights and interests are almost entirely concentrated in this area. Therefore, the British and American communities in Shanghai unanimously and firmly insist that the defense of the central district should be taken over by American troops without any doubt or concession. As for other areas, they can be handed over to Japanese troops in a friendly and reasonable manner.

Admiral Hart Provides a Full Report

Washington, D.C., Associated Press, 15th: Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox announced last night that Admiral Hart, commander of the Asiatic Fleet, is currently "fully informing" the administration of the general situation after the British Defense Forces withdraw from the International Settlement. Secretary Knox stated that Admiral Hart is currently sending reports from Shanghai daily.

Tokyo, Associated Press, 15th: Navy Ministry spokesman Rear Admiral Kanazawa told reporters today that the Japanese Navy does not intend to request changes to the American defense area in Shanghai. The current meeting is limited to the issue of the defense area after the withdrawal of British troops. The spokesman said that the Navy hopes to reach a reasonable solution to the issue of the British troop defense area.

Garrison Authorities Attended Together

The first to arrive yesterday was Colonel Baker, Commander of the 4th Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps, accompanied by Lieutenant Miro, flag officer of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet and aide-de-camp to Admiral Hart, and one Marine Corps captain and one sergeant, who arrived at 8:10 a.m. As a result, the photographers who arrived late felt disappointed. Major General Simons, commander of the British forces, representatives of the French army and navy, Commander Modron of the Italian Navy stationed in Shanghai, and one naval officer also entered the venue early. However, Rear Admiral Takeda, commander of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces, arrived at 10:00 a.m. and stood on the car's running board for a long time to allow photographers to take his picture. In addition to the commanders of the defense forces and their aides-de-camp, Superintendent Smyser of the Municipal Council Police Department and Colonel Hempel, commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, also attended and listened. Admiral Hart dispatched his aide-de-camp, Lieutenant Miro, so he did not attend in person.

Meeting Contents Are Kept Secret

Although the commanders of the defense forces of various countries refused to make any comments on the results of the meeting, according to general rumors yesterday, the American defense forces here requested to completely take over the British defense area, but the Japanese representatives firmly opposed this. Colonel Baker then proposed a compromise solution, the contents of which could not be ascertained. However, the final outcome is still unknown. It is said that the details of the meeting will be announced in a formal press release this morning by Major Mann, secretary of the Defense Forces Joint Committee.

Baker Admits to Holding a Meeting

The Continental Daily News reported that Colonel Baker, Commander of the 4th Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps, invited the commanders of the defense forces (excluding the Japanese commander) to hold a meeting on Monday. Colonel Baker has now confirmed this, but he refused to disclose the contents of the resolution. It is said that he also invited the Japanese side to attend, but they declined. Representatives from the French, Italian, British, and American forces all attended, and Colonel Hempel, commander of the Volunteer Corps, and Superintendent Smaill, deputy chief of the Municipal Council Police Department, also attended and listened. It is understood that the resolution reached at the meeting was that the British defense area should be managed by the defense forces of various countries, that is, the Japanese army would take over the defense of the western Hongkou district, and the American and Italian armies would take over the other British defense areas. Well-informed sources claim that if this is correct, there will be fierce debates at this morning's meeting, as the Japanese demand to take over the entire British defense area will be strongly opposed.

Departure of British Troops Still Not Confirmed

The English-language China Press reported that the official departure date for the British troops stationed in Shanghai has not yet been determined. However, the various British troop units stationed in Shanghai have decided to send at least 23 representatives to broadcast farewell speeches to friends in Shanghai on X·O·D·M· radio station starting at 8:00 p.m. tomorrow (16th). Major General Simons, commander of the British troops stationed in Shanghai, will also give a brief speech to conclude this farewell broadcast. The Continental Daily News also reported that the British troops stationed in Shanghai have begun to dismantle the barbed wire obstacles along the borders of their defense area in preparation for withdrawing from Shanghai in the near future. Major Auchinleck has formally denied the rumors that the British troops will leave Shanghai on August 26. He said that he did not know the date on which the British troops had decided to withdraw.

British Side Requisitions Jardine Matheson Vessels

According to a report from the Ping Ming News reporter, it was learned from the shipping industry that the British side has now requisitioned Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Yong Sheng and Yi Sheng vessels. The Yong Sheng vessel was originally scheduled to depart for Hong Kong today, and the Yi Sheng vessel was also scheduled to depart for Tianjin on the 17th. Both vessels have now temporarily canceled their schedules. Although the company has not announced the reason, it is widely believed that it is related to the withdrawal of British troops.

### More Than Seventy Ships Stalled in the Huangpu River; Moufu Searched While Sailing Near Gutou

The North China Daily News reported that since the Japanese naval authorities announced the blockade of the coast, shipping in various ports has been severely affected. Currently, at least 72 ships sailing on coastal routes have been blocked and moored in Shanghai. According to a shipping company's statement to the reporter yesterday, with an average load capacity of 500 tons per ship, the total number of moored ships is 35,000 tons. Even with the German ship Lemsfels and the Italian Mail Steamship Company's Conte Verde, which are also moored in Shanghai, the shipping industry has become extremely depressed and the situation is very bleak. According to a Da Guang News reporter, the Moufu vessel was inspected by a Japanese warship while passing outside the mouth of the Gutou River. The details are as follows:

Moufu Searched

The German company Melchers & Co.'s Moufu vessel has arrived outside the mouth of the Gutou River, but has been blocked by a Japanese warship, which has boarded the vessel to conduct a search. As of last night, there was no news of its release and entry into the Gutou River. According to inquiries made by the Da Guang News reporter to the company, it is said that after the search, the vessel is expected to enter the Gutou River to unload its cargo. The rumor that it would return to Shanghai is not accurate.

Hanna Returns to Customs

The German company Far Eastern Co.'s Hanna vessel, after being obstructed by a Japanese warship in the waters off Rui'an, returned to Shanghai on the 14th and has prepared to unload its cargo and go through customs clearance. The rumor that it would return to the Gutou River is not true. The company has abandoned this attempt. The vessel is prepared to temporarily moor in the Huangpu River and will not sail on other routes.

Antong Sails to Gutou

It is understood that the British company New Antong vessel has decided to set sail for Gutou tomorrow. It is currently moored at the Roosevelt Wharf and loading cargo. The Italian company Changde vessel, which is currently in Gutou, is temporarily unloading cargo as of yesterday. It is expected to be completed in about three to four days and will return to Shanghai.

Foreign Vessels Stalled in Shanghai

Due to the decline in shipping, many dock workers, coolies, and shipping employees have lost their jobs. All the crew members of the German ship Lemsfels, which is moored within the blockade line in the Huangpu River in Nanshi, remain on board, while the Conte Verde still requires monthly expenses of about 100,000 yuan. The decline in the shipping industry has reached its peak today. Although the Guangzhou Pearl River was announced by the Japanese Navy to be open in June of this year, no foreign vessels have entered the Pearl River to this day due to the Japanese side's harsh regulations on shipping transport.

Guangzhou Non-Stop

According to reliable information from the shipping industry, the Swire Company's vessels sailing to South China have always stopped at both Guangzhou Bay and Guangzhou. This port also sells tickets for this route. However, the company suddenly stopped selling tickets for Guangzhou Bay yesterday. Inquiries made to the company's authorities did not explain the reason, only stating that they had received a telegram from the Guangzhou Bay branch.

Shenhua Aftermath

Regarding the aftermath of the hijacking of the British ship Shenhua, the relevant parties are handling the matter. According to the Ping Ming News reporter's information: (1) A batch of mail on the vessel was undamaged and has been delivered by the post office. (2) More than 20 overseas Chinese passengers have declared their overseas Chinese passports invalid due to their loss and are seeking replacements. (3) There is still no news of the nine kidnapped passengers and the declaration to Fujian to invalidate the hijacked drafts. It has been verified that the hijacked passengers were Jewish, as reported in previous newspapers.

### Important News Summary

About 1,000 bags of mail from eastern Zhejiang are expected to arrive soon. The route is completely separated from sea transport.

The Refugee Relief Association reported: (1) The refugee food standard for the second half of July, totaling 16 days, is 4.25 yuan per person. (2) The second half of July provided food for 15,973 refugees from various charitable organizations. (3) A total of 5,575 refugees were sent away in May, June, and July of this year.

### After Lifting Special Alert, Defenses Remain Tight; Public Concession Still Under Alert Due to Defense Meeting Held Yesterday

Since the authorities of the two concessions began taking precautions on the 9th, dispatching Chinese and Western detectives and police forces, and blockading unnecessary traffic, the anniversary of the Songhu War of Resistance was quietly passed. The martial law measures were extended until 11:00 p.m. on the 14th and then lifted. The barbed wire fences placed at the blockade gaps on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession have been moved to the side of the road, and the armored vehicles in the center of the road have also been removed. There are no longer separate lanes for pedestrians to enter and exit, and there are no restrictions on inspections. The French Volunteer Corps and others have also been demobilized. In order to effectively maintain the security of the British Concession, the Police Department continued to take strict precautions yesterday, coinciding with the leaders of the defense forces of various countries holding a defense meeting. The barbed wire fences placed at the southern end of Simaolu Bridge and Sichuan Road on Yuqiaqing Road have not been removed. However, because the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and the defense forces of various countries were demobilized at 7:00 p.m. the night before, only Chinese and Western detectives are stationed at the gaps, and they still selectively inspect suspicious pedestrians entering and exiting. The blockade barbed wire fences at the southern ends of Chongqing Road and Chengdu Road, which connect to the French Concession, have also been moved to both sides. The situation in all places will return to normal today.

### Two Hostels, Great Eastern and East Asia, Both Had Kidnapping Cases Yesterday; A Traveler Was Kidnapped from the Great Eastern Hostel; The East Asia Kidnapping Case Was Intercepted by Detectives Investigating the Defendant

Yesterday afternoon, at approximately 3:30 PM, two Japanese individuals suddenly arrived at a room in the Great Eastern Hostel on Nanjing Road. They apprehended a Chinese man, put him in a car with license plate number 4995, and sped away. Upon receiving the alert, the Old Zhabei Police Department immediately dispatched both Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. However, both the people and the car had vanished. The investigation is currently underway.

Yesterday morning, around 5:00 AM, two Japanese individuals, accompanied by four Chinese individuals, suddenly arrived at rooms 519 and 513 of the East Asia Hostel on Nanjing Road. They arrived in a car with license plate number 4991. The two Japanese individuals, armed with handguns, intended to abduct the travelers in the two rooms. Fortunately, the two travelers shouted for help. After someone reported to the Old Zhabei Police Department, Chinese and foreign detectives were dispatched to the scene. The two Japanese individuals and three of the Chinese individuals were arrested. One of the Chinese individuals managed to escape. They were immediately taken to the police station. After a preliminary interrogation by the police chief, it was learned that one of the two travelers was Wang Nanguo, 45 years old, from Taizhou, engaged in the pig bristle business. The other was Shen Linchong, 34 years old, also from Taizhou. According to the Japanese individuals, the two travelers were related to the guerrillas, but there was no evidence to support this claim. It was later discovered that the Japanese individuals worked at the Japanese Consulate. However, there were no orders to arrest anyone. Subsequently, the police department sent the two Japanese individuals to the Japanese Consulate. The remaining three Chinese individuals are being held for questioning by the court.

### Zhang Xiaolin: Coffin Sealing This Afternoon; Funeral Procession and Temporary Placement in Funeral Parlor; Many Notables Went to Pay Their Condolences Yesterday

The case of the maritime figure Zhang Xiaolin and his disciple Wu Jianchen being shot and killed by Zhang's bodyguard Lin Huaibu at 214 Rue Wagner in the French Concession the day before yesterday, at approximately 1:45 PM, has been detailed in various newspapers. After Zhang's death, his body was laid out in his residence. Subsequently, the Shanghai Special Second Court dispatched a prosecutor to Zhang's residence for an inspection. Shortly thereafter, technicians from the Chinese Funeral Parlor were summoned to wash, make up, and inject preservatives into Zhang's body. It was then moved to the hall downstairs for placement. Meanwhile, monks and Taoists were invited for memorial services, and the family members were in deep mourning. It is estimated that over five to six hundred people went to pay their condolences throughout the day, including Huang Jinrong, Cai Hongsheng, Yang Shunquan, Ma Changsheng, Lu Xuepu, Fan Huichun, and famous actors like Zhou Xinfang. Dozens of telegrams of condolence were also received from afar. It is now scheduled for coffin sealing at 2:00 PM this afternoon (the 16th) at his residence. His attire will be a Ming Dynasty (landowner style) ceremonial robe. The coffin will be made of the finest zero-yin Phoebe zhennan wood, worth approximately eight thousand yuan. The funeral procession will be held immediately after the coffin sealing. It is said that the procession will be very simple, with only cars being used. At that time, the French Municipal Council will dispatch a full military band to participate. The coffin will be temporarily placed in the Chinese Funeral Parlor, and the burial will be scheduled for a later date. The route of today's funeral procession is recorded below: From the residence on Rue Wagner, head west to Songshan Road, pass Luzon Road, turn to the end of Avenue Foch, head south to Route Hogue at the Chinese Funeral Parlor.

Wu Jiancheng's Coffin Sealed Yesterday

As for Wu Jiancheng, who was killed at the same time as Zhang, his body was inspected by the prosecutor of the Special Second Court at the mortuary on Route Tenant yesterday at noon, after which his wives, Wu Zhangshi and Wu Wangshi, jointly signed for and claimed the body. After the inspection, the corpse bearers took the body to the Central Funeral Parlor for coffin sealing.

The Murderer Interrogated This Morning

As for the assassin Lin Huaibu, he is still held in the police station. Because yesterday was the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the police department was on holiday, so he was not sent to court. He must be interrogated today. It is heard that Zhang's chauffeur, A Si, who is also the murderer's old man and also serves as a guarantor, is now also detained in the police station, pending investigation to determine whether there is any connection with this case.

### Group Rice Purchase: Unremitting Efforts, Fixed at 20 Yuan Per Bag

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce relayed a letter from the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee, stating that the committee was established on the 5th of this month and submitted its charter and list of members for registration on the 8th. The reason for the committee's organization was to follow the instructions of the concession authorities and attempt to stabilize rice prices and the rice market through evaluation methods. However, this method is only a temporary solution, not a fundamental cure. If we talk about a fundamental cure, then it lies in ensuring a steady supply and increasing reserves. Therefore, at the inaugural meeting, a proposal was made to promote group rice purchases. It was decided that, in addition to the rice industry associations finding ways to transport commercial ships and continue to collectively order 100,000 bags of foreign rice in the near future, a letter should also be sent to the Food Regulation Association to continue its efforts and achieve significant results. It is proposed that the Chamber of Commerce advise all industries to promote group rice purchases, requiring each industry's firms, companies, and factories to assess their needs, collectively purchase in bulk, and ensure adequate reserves for the people's food supply. Even in the event of changes in weather or human affairs, it will prevent public panic and the rush to buy, which stimulates market prices. This is what the committee earnestly prays for. Therefore, a special letter is submitted for approval and implementation, without any further anticipation. In order to prevent rice shortages and ensure the food supply, a corresponding letter is prepared and forwarded. The Chamber of Commerce is requested to earnestly promote it. It is said that the pharmaceutical industry has already notified its members to pay a deposit of 20 yuan per bag within five days of receiving the letter, in order to facilitate collective purchase.

### Banking Industry Limited to Reporting Interest Rates by the End of the Month

The Shanghai Banking Guild recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance to thoroughly investigate the deposit and loan interest rates of various banks. Before the end of August, the interest rates for the first half of this year must be reported in a table. The table is divided into (1) deposit interest rates, divided into fixed-term, current, and ordinary savings, and (2) loan interest rates, divided into credit mortgages, bill discounts, and interbank lending. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance has designated the Currency Department to send specialists to inspect the account books, inventory status, and other relevant documents of various banks to prevent direct commercial operations and hoarding of goods, as well as whether the use of deposits complies with the law, in order to implement supervision and management and bring the entire financial system into order.

### Post Office News: Shanghai-Guangdong Flights Resume

According to Shanghai Post Office news, flights between Shanghai and Guangzhou have resumed. All airmail sent from Shanghai to Guangzhou can now be accepted as usual.

### Chinese Flour Mills Suffer Dual Difficulties; Each Shipment of Wheat Requires 2-3 Million Yuan; Exports Hopeless, Japanese Mills Resuming Competition

The flour milling industry of local Chinese businesses in this city has recently been forced to halt production due to the interruption of raw materials. Bakeries, noodle shops, and steamed bun shops, which have relied on the industry's direct supply, did indeed experience a period of panic. After the manufacturers introduced the temporary use of inland flour and foreign flour, the turmoil began to subside. The new foreign flour previously ordered by companies in this city has been delivered by companies such as Weed & Co. Flour from factories in the occupied areas arrives in Shanghai daily, with four to five thousand to ten thousand bags. The Japanese factories in this city are also accelerating production to meet local demand. Therefore, the problem of flour supply for the people's food in this city has been temporarily resolved.

Sales Channels Seized

However, the Chinese flour milling industry, which has endured difficulties and maintained operations for three years since the Shanghai Incident, has been declining. According to the industry itself, since the beginning of the Chinese mechanized flour industry, it has never suffered such overlapping difficulties as today. Currently, the northern and northeastern sales areas are entirely occupied by foreign flour. The southern seas are blocked, and Shanghai is also invaded by foreign flour, Japanese flour, and flour from the occupied areas. As for the raw materials, domestic wheat is subject to control and is also blocked. The flour mills have always relied on the surge of new wheat throughout the year for their entire business, but now that hope is completely lost.

Inconvenience of Ordering Wheat

Although there is still the option of ordering foreign wheat, the cost is extremely high due to the sharp depreciation of the exchange rate. Each shipment requires 2-3 million yuan in capital. Not only is there concern about economic inadequacy, but also many foreign companies are afraid of the risk and dare not accept orders. Therefore, only two batches were finalized last month, and the foreign companies are still unwilling to bear the responsibility for unexpected events along the way. Moreover, the shipping schedule cannot be accurate. The earliest shipment recently telegraphed that it would arrive in Shanghai after the end of August, but that is still hard to believe. Even one ship ordered and loaded by the Japanese themselves, which was originally scheduled to arrive now, must be delayed until next week for confirmation.

### All Customs Police Demand Increased Subsidies; Customs Agrees to Follow the Post Office's Example

Over a thousand customs police and other unranked employees of the Jianghai Customs have recently requested the authorities to increase subsidies based on the cost-of-living index published monthly by the Public Works Department, and also requested an annual increase of 40% of their monthly salary. It is learned that the Customs Commissioner had previously agreed to handle the employee subsidies in the same way as the Shanghai Postal Administration. According to a reporter from the Tax Police New Voice Society yesterday, the Postal Administration employees' subsidies, in addition to rice subsidies and local subsidies, have now been approved by the Kunming Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications, and an additional 75% of their monthly salary has been paid to each person since June of this year. The tax police continued, "Last month, one yuan of national currency was only worth 23 cents. Our salaried class has seen at least a 50% drop compared to pre-war salaries." It is also learned that the Jianghai Customs Police intend to separately petition the authorities to open training courses and conduct examinations to provide opportunities for promotion.

### Lee Yu-ying's Sudden Death Case: Account Verification in Progress; Further Verification After Clearing the Accounts

Lee Yu-ying, also known as Jie Ru, the head nurse of the Chinese and Western Sanatorium at 563 Route Pere Robert, died of a stroke, leaving behind 8,700 yuan in cash, three gold bracelets, over 300 pieces of clothing, and miscellaneous items. During the autopsy, the prosecutor indicated on the autopsy report that the items should be handed over to the deceased's parents, Lee Shih-chen and Lee Lin-shi, for collection. However, Lu Zhong-an and Lu Zhen-qing, the father and son directors of the Chinese and Western Sanatorium, claimed that Lee Yu-ying had embezzled over 10,000 yuan from the hospital's funds during her lifetime, and that the remaining items were insufficient to cover the debt by over 1,000 yuan. Therefore, they withheld the inheritance and refused to return it. As a result, Lee Shih-chen, the deceased's father, entrusted three lawyers, Wang Heng-yi, Zhuang Ding-dong, and Lee Chung-dao, to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against Lu Zhong-an and Lu Zhen-qing, the directors of the Chinese and Western Sanatorium, to preserve the evidence. Judge Yu Chang-zi held a preliminary hearing, and the defendants appointed lawyer Ling Chang-hsien and others as their representatives. The hearing was adjourned to a later date and the account books were summoned for further questioning. The case was reopened for continued hearing the day before yesterday. Both parties were represented by their lawyers. The defendant's side presented over twenty volumes of large and small Western-style account books. According to Lu Zhen-qing's testimony, the hospital's money was managed by me. Starting in July last year, I fell ill, so I entrusted the deceased to manage it on my behalf. Until her death, she did not hand over the accounts clearly. The accountants are currently verifying the accounts and have submitted a report. After deducting the deceased's inheritance, she still owes over 1,000 yuan, etc. The plaintiff's side also appointed an accountant to be present to assist in the verification of the accounts, and submitted evidence. After examining the situation and reviewing the account books, the court ordered that the case be temporarily suspended and resumed after the accounts had been clarified. Starting yesterday morning, the accountants appointed by both parties went to the court to review the account books.

### Fashion Store Owner Kidnapped; Criminals Vehemently Deny Guilt; Victim Proves They Participated in the Kidnapping; Awaiting Summons of Witnesses to Clarify the Truth

Unexpectedly, Yang escaped on July 18 and was escorted home by the police. Several days later, Yang suddenly received a threatening letter from the Shanghai Special Agent Team in western Shanghai, stating that Yang should not have

Escaped Privately

and was given three days to contact Yu Yapei, the general manager of the China New Musical Instrument Manufacturing Factory at 1234 Jing'an Temple Road. Yang reported to the police, who ordered detectives to investigate. According to Yu, the handwriting on the letter was similar to that of Liu Yong-sheng, a worker who had left the factory from Shandong. Based on the clues, the police arrested Liu and sent Liu's handwriting to Mei Yu, a handwriting expert at the Public Works Department. It was verified that Liu's

Handwriting

was the same as the threatening letter, confirming that it was written by Liu. Liu was sent to the First Special Court. Song Renfu and Lu Wanping, partners of the Jin Tai Fashion Company, identified Liu in court as being present when the store owner was kidnapped. However, the defendant vehemently denied the charges. The court deemed the case to be serious and the victim was not present, so the hearing was adjourned. The case was continued yesterday morning by Judge Chuan Lin in the Second Criminal Court. The victim, Yang Yu-rui, was also present in court.

According to Yang's Testimony

On that day, while I was reading the newspaper in the store, several kidnappers suddenly entered, threatened with guns, and forbade me from looking up. They put me in a car. Two bandits sat on either side of me, watching me with weapons. One bandit sat in the front with the driver, and black glasses were used to cover my eyes. We drove directly to the bandits' lair, a shed. Two bandits were assigned to watch me during the day, and three at night. After two days, two bandits went out to buy cigarettes and

Handed Over a Handgun

to another bandit, who watched my movements with the gun in both hands. Not long after, the bandit dozed off, so I took the opportunity to escape from a small path in the back. The bandit woke up in surprise and chased me from the main road, but fortunately did not catch me. However, the defendant was one of the two bandits on either side of the car, etc. When questioned, the defendant Liu Yong-sheng still vehemently denied, saying that he was working at the Ming Jing Film and Martial Arts Association at 20 Guomin Lane, 585 Rue Foch, and was

Working

and did not go out on that day. This point can be confirmed by summoning Ge Tan, a clerk from the association, to testify. In order to seek the truth, Judge Chuan, not wanting to be lacking in detail, ordered the defendant to write a note in court and ordered that the case be adjourned again for seven days to summon Ge Tan to court for further verification. The defendant was sent back into custody.

### Woman Dies After Miscarriage; Coffin Carried Out the Back Door; Causes Neighborly Discontent; Reported to Police for Investigation

Wu Jia-yu, a man from Jiangbei residing on the upper floor of 303 East Jiaxing Road, who is now twelve years old, married a woman from his hometown, Wang, as his wife in November last year. Since their marriage, the relationship between the couple has been average. Recently, Wu Wang became pregnant for four months, and suddenly had a miscarriage on the 12th of this month. Ms. Wang's condition deteriorated sharply after the miscarriage, and she died on the 13th. Wu Jia-yu and his mother, Wu Zhu-shi, immediately prepared a coffin for burial and held a funeral at noon the next day. However, the coffin was

Carried Out the Back Door

causing general neighbors to complain and discuss a lot. Some said that the cause of death of the deceased was unclear. When Wu Jia-yu heard about it, he said it started conflict and they physically fought, and he reported to the police, saying that hooligans were taking the opportunity to extort money, while Xiao Ling-shi from 297th also reported to the police, accusing Wu of assault. The Chinese Detective Home Jujia, and detective Dong Qingquan went to investigate. The coffin had been transported to Dong Jiazhai on Qimei Road in Zhabei, but because Wu Jia-yu and others

Did Not Seek Medical Treatment

when the deceased was critically ill, and did not notify the deceased's relatives after her death, and secretly transported the coffin out through the back door, the circumstances were suspicious. In order to clarify the cause of death, in addition to hanging the coffin back in the car to the autopsy, the Wu Jia-yu and Wu Zhu-shi were arrested and taken to the Jiaxing Road Police Station and sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the above situation, saying that the deceased's

Cause of Death Was Suspicious

asking permission for detention, and to wait for the procuratorate to verify the body before further investigation, etc. When questioned, Wu Jia-yu and others said that Wu Wang-shi had indeed died of a miscarriage. When she was seriously ill, they had sought the help of a fortune teller to treat her, and that after death, because the landlord did not allow the coffin to be transported out of the front door, they had to transport the coffin out of the back door, etc. After a brief questioning by the judge Chuanto the neighbors Xiao Yuan-shi and others, they were ordered to be held in custody pending autopsy verification.

### Prison Factory Management Sued for Dereliction of Duty; Defendant Flatly Denies

Dong Henian, the manager of the toothbrush factory in the prison of the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District on Route Massenet in the French Concession, was suspected of corruption. Huang Xiqiang, the warden of the prison, learned of this and reported it to the warden on the 20th of last month to conduct an inspection. As a result, over thirty taels of pig bristles, worth four yuan per tael, and four hundred toothbrush boards were confiscated. Warden Zhao then convened a meeting to discuss and resolved to dismiss Dong. Dong heard the news and directly asked the warden to exempt him from dismissal. Because he did not achieve his purpose, he scolded the warden as an old bastard. Warden Zhao therefore detained Dong and sent him to the Procuratorate of the Second Special Court for investigation. After the investigation by Prosecutor Sun Wei, he was prosecuted for crimes such as dereliction of duty and obstructing official duties. The case was heard by Court President Liao of the Second Special Court in the First Criminal Court. The defendant Dong Hongnian hired lawyer Zhang Danping to defend him. First, the prosecutor stated the intention of the prosecution, and then several staff members and prisoners involved in the case separately testified about the discovery process of the case. Based on this, the court questioned the defendant Dong Henian. According to the confession, the confiscated pig bristles and other items were handed down by the previous manager. As for the point of insulting the warden, he flatly denied it. The court deemed it necessary to investigate and ordered the hearing to be adjourned to a later date.

### Big Merchants from Northern Jiangsu in Shanghai Establish Clinics and Pharmacies

Recently, Yuan Delin, a prominent merchant from Northern Jiangsu in Shanghai, together with his friends Wang Qishan, Fang Peiji, Li Chunhe, Yang Shiji, Yin Shunji, etc., raised funds to organize a clinic and pharmacy to benefit the poor, without charging any fees. The clinic is located at the residence of physician Wu Bingqing at 101 Yongping Lane, Route Mayen, and Dr. Wu was invited to serve as the director of diagnosis and treatment. Patients flock to the door for treatment, one after another. Dr. Wu carefully examines the patients and succeeds in treating them all. Patients are not only grateful for the benevolence of Yuan, Wang and others, but also for Dr. Wu's ability to revive the dead. However, the cost of medicine is expensive, and the supply is insufficient. Without the help of great philanthropists, it may be difficult to sustain. Therefore, it is hoped that those who sympathize will provide enthusiastic support.

### A Large Number of Arms and Ammunition Seized in a Small Lane on Rue Paul Beau; All Confiscated Rifles Are of Unknown Origin

Although the "August 13th" alert has passed safely, the defense works of the two concessions were removed yesterday morning. However, the French Concession police authorities are still meticulously protecting the security within the concession. Police officers such as patrol teams continue to perform their duties in the hot sun without any slackening. It is heard that around 8:00 PM the night before last night, the French Police Department seized a large number of arms and ammunition inside the dividing wall of a small alley in 258 Wangzhi Road, Rue Paul Beau. It is heard that the firearms were all rifles. The police department is investigating the origin of these firearms. One theory is that the discovery of the firearms was made because a woman at No. 13 in the small alley had a chicken fly over the dividing wall, so she ordered a child to climb the wall to catch it, and that the firearms were discovered. The police department received the news and immediately went to seize them.

### Detectives Forming Gangs to Rob and Assault, Arrested and Sentenced to Imprisonment

Xu Jiasheng from Tongzhou, who worked as Detective No. 306 at the French Concession Police Station, along with his fellow townsman Zhang Boping, and the fugitive Zhang Guifu who instigated the crime, used their service revolvers at 1:30 PM on the 7th of this month to attempt to rob the home of wealthy Tongzhou merchant Wu Mingjiang at No. 20, Lane 133, Gordon Road. The case was discovered, and the Chinese and foreign detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station arrested and escorted them to the Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the trial. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin requested severe punishment. When questioning the two defendants, they confessed to being misled by the instigator Zhang Guifu and pleaded for leniency. Judge Huang sentenced Xu Jiasheng to three years in prison, Zhang Boping (accessory) to three years and six months. A triangular bayonet was confiscated. (Xu's pistol has been returned to the French Concession Police Station).

### Chased on the Street, Crushed to Death by a Car

Wang Jian, a woman from Shaoxing, aged forty-two this year, went to the Zhenghe employment agency at No. 328, Rue Ratard yesterday morning to seek employment. At 8:45 AM, she and Wang Shuming, an Anhui native and employee of the agency responsible for sending maids to work, were chasing each other back and forth across the road in front of the agency's door, arguing over a palm-leaf fan. At that moment, a No. F888 public bus of the French Concession, driven by Lu Jingen, a local driver, was speeding south to north from No. 270. Wang was unable to avoid it and was knocked down. The wheels ran over her head, crushing her skull, and she died instantly. Wang Shuming, who had been chasing the deceased, fled in fear of punishment after the incident and is currently being pursued by the police.

Moore, with four wins in five games in Group A2, was neck and neck with Bailemen. Unexpectedly, yesterday's loss to Tianxing formed a three-way tie with Shangxing and Nanyang. Whether they can win the championship depends on whether they can defeat Bailemen in the future. At the same time, Bailemen must also lose to Shangxing. However, Moore must also face Shangxing again. At the end of the first half, Tianxing took a five-point lead with a score of 24-19. Although Moore's Ling Peng rose in the second half, the overall score was still a bitter 47-50 loss due to the excessive losses in the first half.

The Forex market situation yesterday: HSBC's listing showed no fluctuations. The informal market for British and American exchanges was average.

Tianjin Also Sees Flat British and Rising U.S. Exchange

Shanghai remittance dropped by 0.5 yuan to 108.5 yuan. One Union banknote in the informal market rose slightly by 0.25 yuan to 96.5 yuan.

### Hong Kong Gang Purchases at Low Prices; Gold Price Wants to Decline but Stops

Yesterday's spot gold disk market situation: always flat and tired. Although most traders were thinking of running up the price, in fact they were hesitant to advance, which made the general floating traders tend to sell, and the quiet exchange market was also a reason for not being able to rise easily. The morning started at 5,780 yuan. After opening, it fell by ten yuan. Then, thanks to the sudden purchase by gold dealers, money changers, and Hong Kong gangs, it rose to 5,805 yuan. Although it was suppressed by the sale of another money changer, gold and silver dealers continued to absorb it sharply, and it rose again to 5,825 yuan. It was heard that at this time the foreign exchange was slightly soft, and in the silence before the noon closing, securities firms sought to sell, resulting in a closing price of only 5,812 yuan. The initial market in the afternoon was still good. After money changers, silver shops, and others disgorged, it fell to 5,803 yuan. The evening closing was 5,807 yuan, slightly lower by one yuan compared to the previous day. After closing, the market trend was slightly softer, retreating to the edge of the 5,800 yuan level. The total transaction volume for the day was over 2,000 taels. Silver shop ornament gold was unchanged. Customs gold and others remained flat.

Spot Gold Only Slightly Down One Yuan

Since the morning, each tael (ten liang) initially saw a continuous rise in exchange rate, a slight loosening of the U.S. dollar, and a price cut by a certain bank, resulting in a small opening price of 28 yuan. A silver shop offered 20 taels to gold shops at 5,780 yuan. Then, a certain bank was still full of selling intentions, and it fell another ten yuan. A silver shop offered fifty taels to money changers, retreating to 5,770 yuan. Fortunately, Hong Kong gangs were secretly active in purchasing at low prices, and a certain gold shop also relied on rich merchants to buy in, so it soon rebounded by 35 yuan. A gold shop bought 30 taels from a silver shop, rising to 5,805 yuan. After that, another money changer suddenly came to vomit, and it once again fell to 5,790 yuan. However, because money changers, silver shops, gold shops and others jointly bought on behalf of customers, and there were many floating traders who were dragged in, it once rose to 5,825 yuan. At this time, the turnover was still strong, but before long, silver shops and securities firms suddenly sold at high prices, and many floating traders also took the opportunity to close out their profits. The price had returned to 5,800 yuan before closing, and this price was easily absorbed. After entering, silver shops changed from selling to buying, and floating traders also cleared out their positions, so the closing price was still at 5,812 yuan. The situation at the opening of the afternoon market was quite good. First, a gold shop bought ten taels from a silver shop, rising to 5,818 yuan. Then it rose another two yuan. A silver shop bought ten taels from a gold shop for 5,820 yuan. Subsequently, a certain bank poured in, reducing the price by more than ten yuan. A silver shop offered ten taels to gold shops, falling to 5,803 yuan. After entering, a certain money changer covered shorts and securities firms bought in, and it rose again by four yuan. A silver shop bought twenty taels from a gold shop for 5,807 yuan, setting the evening closing price (after the closing, the market was slightly soft, and money changers sold a lot, losing to 5,800 yuan, but there were few transactions). As a result, it was slightly down by one yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 55 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold from cash shops was more than ten yuan higher than the spot gold, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current bid gold was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

Ornament Gold Still Suspends at 600 Yuan

The exchange price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael did not change throughout the day. Datong Line still suspended the original price of 600 yuan. The price of New Trade Line was the same as the upper price, and the purchase price was reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Foreign Currency Market Declines Daily

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: Spot gold was stable, and British and American gold pounds did not rise or fall much. The supply and demand of British gold notes were uniform, and the market price was stable. The fluctuation of U.S. dollar notes was minimal, with a minimum of 18.24 yuan and a maximum of 18.39 yuan, finally settling at 18.35 yuan. The result was similar to the previous day. There was a slight supply of Hong Kong notes, and the market price was slightly lower by one point. The demand for Japanese remaining notes was still strong, with an evening market of 1.365 yuan. The situation of Korean notes was getting worse and worse, with a downward trend. The evening market had retreated and was on par with the legal currency.

### Securities: Strong Demand for Domestic Debt, Dividend Payment by Kung Ho Cheung Wharf

The securities gray market is showing increasing upward momentum. Observing the continuous acquisition of shares by various banks such as Zhongfu and Xinhua in recent days, there are discernible clues, indicating increased avenues for chip release. The supply of chips on the market has noticeably dried up, while demand remains strong. It is rumored that the Shanghai Defense Forces Conference has reached a peaceful resolution, with no issues concerning the security of the concessions. The future of the current situation exhibits signs of gradual clarification, leading to a sustained increase in demand for government bonds. Yesterday, Lianhe and Hengfu consistently bought shares, while Lianyi and Huaiwei were also active. Xinfu also showed strong demand, and Jiufeng gradually emerged to cover short positions. Lemao accumulated nearly 120,000 Class A shares. However, Tongkang and Hongkang were the only two firms that sold shares. Yongkang and Tianfeng sold Class A shares, with the short side covering positions while simultaneously selling, yet the market price remained extremely strong. As a result, the market continued to rise by between two dimes and six and a half dimes. Class A shares were priced at 60 yuan, and Class C and E shares pierced through 50 yuan, reaching new highs after the dividend payment. The total transaction volume amounted to over 900,000 yuan. A concise table is provided below.

Stock trading: 20 shares of Sanyou Industrial Company were traded at a price of 20.05 yuan.

Yesterday's stock market at the Public Chamber of Commerce was extremely quiet. The entire market seemed to be awaiting the outcome of the Defense Forces Conference. Prices remained virtually unchanged, and transaction volume was extremely low. However, the overall sentiment remained optimistic.

London, 14th (Wednesday) dispatch: Today, the listed market prices for Chinese foreign debt and shares of various British companies in the Far East remained flat, with no changes in market conditions.

Kung Ho Cheung Wharf, a British company managed by Jardine Matheson & Co., Ltd., has scheduled the payment of an interim dividend for the fiscal year 1940 on August 29th, at a rate of 17 yuan in national currency per share.

### Grain: Abundant Rice Reserves, Stable Rice Prices

Following a softening of the foreign rice market the day before, yesterday saw a more pronounced decline. This was primarily due to a continuous influx of goods, leading to a thickening of reserves. Each warehouse now holds between 800,000 and 900,000 bags, raising concerns about market setbacks. Buyers, wary of past rapid and significant fluctuations, have adopted a cautious approach, focusing on actual sales and only meeting immediate needs, including domestic and local merchants. Speculators, typically driven by opportunistic intentions, buy high and sell when fatigued. However, they are now only observing and not acting. Consequently, the market has seen more selling than buying, wavering initially before declining sharply. Closing prices fell by about one yuan compared to the previous market. The market has a large volume of reserves, with no end in sight for supplies. Furthermore, subsidized rice sales are about to commence, and warehouses are eager to clear their inventories due to the hot weather. Actual sales remain hindered, and stagnation has befallen both speculators and merchants. The total transaction volume for spot rice was only 2,600 to 2,700 bags. No. 1 old Saigon rice opened at only 57.3 yuan, new rice at 55.6 yuan, No. 2 rice at 53 yuan to 52.35 yuan, and small Jiaoxi rice at 52.3 yuan. No. 2 Siamese rice was only at 51.2 yuan, a decrease of one yuan to one and a half yuan compared to the previous market. Initial quotations for recovered original packages were half a yuan lower due to sluggishness among both buyers and speculators. However, some original sources covered their positions, stabilizing market sentiment. No. 2 Saigon rice was at 62.12 yuan, No. 2 Siamese rice at 62.2 yuan, and Jianyuan original source at 62.6 yuan, with a total transaction volume of four to five hundred tons.

Glutinous rice also saw brisk sales. However, there was a shortage of high-quality goods on the market, leading sellers to be unwilling to easily release their holdings. Under this support, prices only rose by half a yuan. Among them, Guanjin Litte opened at 61.5 yuan and 61 yuan, Changdan goods at 58.9 yuan, Hong Kong Litte at 59 yuan, middle quality at 57 yuan, and secondary goods at 52.3 yuan.

Over a thousand bags of thick and thin japonica rice continued to arrive. Amidst the decline in foreign rice prices, rumors circulated that the off-market dark market followed suit, falling by about 1.5 yuan. Changbang fresh Qing japonica rice was at 66.7 yuan, Wuxi Qing japonica rice at 65 yuan, Changzhou Sukun at 63.4 yuan, and Juezhi Su at 61.2 yuan. There was no market for thin rice. Nangang original package fresh early rice was at 62.3 yuan, and broken grains were seen at 60 yuan and 59 yuan, with Wujian at 47.6 yuan.

Zhoupu new japonica rice, due to a sudden shortage of arrivals, did not soften despite ordinary market appetite, maintaining a stable price of 62 yuan and 61.5 yuan.

### Local Street Sales: Mostly Using Japanese Factory Flour

The current flour market situation is generally stable. Following the forced shutdown of Fuxin Factory due to the interruption of raw material supply, Fufeng Factory has continued to supply flour. Most of the local street sales outlets are using Japanese flour and domestic flour. Therefore, there is no current shortage of flour. There are also rumors that flour loaded by Northern factories has been seized. Although not confirmed, it has caused unease among the people. The price of Chinese flour remains at 15 yuan, and the price of Japanese Phoenix brand flour has also stabilized, with this month opening at 14.6 yuan to 14.625 yuan and September at 14.65 yuan. The price of foreign flour has also remained unchanged. The total transaction volume for various flours is estimated to be around 6,000 bags.

Wheat market transactions remain sluggish. The supply from inland sources has not been overwhelming, and merchants with goods in storage are waiting for prices to rise. However, due to the difficulty of transporting goods into the concessions, they are at the mercy of the Japanese factories' scrutiny. Prices remain at around 20 yuan, with no way to increase them further. It is heard that the Japanese factories have good demand, but sellers are unwilling to release their goods easily. Therefore, the transaction volume is only over 3,000 bags.

### Yarn and Cotton: New Buyers Hesitant, Yarn Prices Deteriorating Daily

The yarn market continues to decline, with a persistently weak trend. This is due to sluggish spot sales and a stagnant buyer appetite. Furthermore, the factory side is urging sales, leading to low morale. New buyers are hesitant. As for major traders, they are adopting a wait-and-see approach and are temporarily not active. The market is dominated by weak day traders engaging in scalping, with frequent buying and selling, but the market is shrinking.

The spot yarn market opened weak in the morning, lacking momentum. Scalpers and speculators are all adopting a short-term strategy, trying to sell after raising prices. 20-count Double Horse yarn opened at 926 yuan, but there were few buyers, and the situation was stagnant. It was heard that actual sales were slow, and selling pressure was high. The market gradually declined to 900 yuan. The half-day transaction volume totaled 1,830 bags. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 30 yuan. Today, 555 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each trade is listed below:

Same trade: 1,570 bags; Hong Kong: 250 bags;

Inland: 10 bags; Total: 1,830 bags.

### Dull Cotton Market

The spot cotton market remains quiet, with no hope of progress from any side. This is because yarn prices are deteriorating daily, and the factory's attitude is cold. Therefore, raw cotton has little prospect of improvement. As for the overseas cotton market, due to Germany's intensified attacks, the situation is also inclined to fall rather than rise. Domestic cotton prices are generally on a declining path.

Three Yu Hua: 184 bales; Same trade purchased: 189 bales.

Huoji Cao Bao: 155 bales; Same trade purchased: 200 bales.

Mitelin: 258 bales; Gongda purchased: 100 pieces.

In addition, news from overseas cotton markets indicates that the New York cotton market is sluggish, with traders adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Due to the sluggishness of spot transactions, cotton prices have become weak, resulting in closing prices falling by 1-2 pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by over half a rupee.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trade has ultimately been dragged down by the decline in yarn prices, and the future appears as bleak as yarn prices. No transactions occurred throughout the day.

### Piece Goods: Factory Increase Warehouse Rent, Speculators Wavering, Eastern Cloth Continues to Decline

The cloth market continues to weaken due to narrow sales channels, weak cotton yarn prices, factories urging the withdrawal of warehouse receipts, and sharply increased warehouse rental fees. Speculators' confidence has been shaken. Prices for spun cloth, twill, and fine cloth have continued to fall by 2.5 dimes per piece, while bleached and dyed cloth have fallen by 3-5 dimes. Local street transactions totaled over 300 pieces. Zhejiang merchants handled over 100 pieces of spun cloth, colored cloth, and colored twill. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants handled over 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Overseas, Singapore and other places handled over 4,000 pieces of bleached cloth and colored twill. 485 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on the 15th.

The decline in Eastern cloth continues. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened in the morning at 31.8 yuan, with sellers eager to sell, leading to a straight decline. The market price fell to 30.9 yuan in the afternoon, before rebounding slightly to 31.2 yuan at the close. The momentum of Sijunzi serge is weakening, falling to 8.95 dimes at one point, before recovering to 9 dimes at the close. However, market sentiment is weak, and there is currently little prospect of improvement.

### Oil Market: Edible Oil Rebounds

Recently, the oil market has been affected by the decline in prices in production areas, which has impacted sentiment in Shanghai. The market has fallen for three consecutive days. Initially, this morning saw more selling than buying, with opening prices falling by more than one yuan compared to the previous day. Later, speculators became active, taking advantage of the low prices to buy in. Merchants seized the opportunity to raise prices, and the market sentiment improved, returning to the original level. 300 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were traded at prices ranging from 62.5 yuan to 63 yuan. 750 pieces of road goods were traded at prices ranging from 62.5 yuan to 64 yuan. 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were traded at 93.5 yuan. 20 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded at 97 yuan. 300 dan of Dayouyu Factory soybean oil were traded at prices ranging from 70 yuan to 75 yuan.

In addition, 820 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong today.

### Sugar Market: No Prospects for Jinjiang Sugar to Arrive in Shanghai

The sugar market continued to show slight tightness yesterday. The Association's quoted price for spot No. 24 coarse white sugar remained relatively stable at 72.4 yuan. The price of goods in outside warehouses was initially flat before tightening, ultimately rising by two dimes to 72 yuan to 72.2 yuan. The price for delivery on the 22nd for re-exported goods remained at 56.7 yuan. Dutch cotton white sugar showed tightness, with TML at 3.3 yuan, up by 3 dimes, and KD at 12 yuan, up by 5 dimes. Dutch red sugar was at 59 yuan to 59.4 yuan. Taikoo Car White B was at 75.3 yuan, and DY was at 12.6 yuan, with no changes. H red sugar was at 58.3 yuan, up by 4 dimes. According to news from Jinjiang, the price of domestic sugar is too high, making it impossible to transport it to Shanghai. It is more convenient to transport it to Oujiang by sailboat, and the high price of sugar in the interior is also a factor.

### Coal: Anthracite Dust Rebounds

Since the decline in anthracite dust prices last month, sales have been sluggish, with little improvement. However, recently, stimulated by the rising prices of lump coal, it has shown a slight rebound. Indian anthracite dust is priced at 175 yuan per ton, Kailuan No. 1 dust at 160 yuan, No. 2 dust at 140 yuan, and Keelung dust at 120 yuan. These are all wholesale prices among traders, with a small margin added for delivery to customers.

### Metals: Black Iron Billets Continue to Rise

The black iron billet market has recently changed its appearance due to the further contraction of foreign exchange rates, which has boosted market sentiment. In addition, traders from Tianjin have been actively inquiring in the past few days, and local bottle factories, mirror factories, printing factories, and can factories have also been seeking supplies, creating a lively atmosphere in the market. Holders are confident, and prices have continued to increase compared to the past. The current market price is quoted at 1,100 yuan per bundle, which is several tens of yuan higher than the previous market price. If foreign merchants purchase large quantities of this commodity in the future, the market price may see further improvement.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: New Jinshan Branches Offered, Price Opens at 250 Yuan, Limited Arrival of New Jinshan Vegetables Leads to Rebound

The price of new Jinshan branches is high, and merchants have not yet received any goods. Recently, trading firms have tentatively handled over ten boxes, which have arrived in Shanghai for trial sales. It was heard yesterday that they were sold for 250 yuan, which can be described as an unprecedented new record. When more batches arrive, there may be a possibility of a price decrease.

The price of new Xuzhou Jinshan vegetables had previously fallen by over ten yuan due to a slight increase in arrivals. However, production prices have rebounded, and there has been a shortage of goods from other sources. In addition, merchants from Guangdong and Shantou have been inquiring, leading to a recovery in prices. Yesterday, the market price was 85 yuan, with particularly high-quality ones at 90 yuan.

### Seafood: Scarce Arrival of Yantai Shrimp Tails

The supply of Yantai shrimp tails has been extremely scarce recently, resulting in limited inventory. Goods from Longxudao were once quoted at 330 yuan, but no agreement was reached. A batch was finally sold yesterday, for 326 yuan. In addition, Annam Tianbian tails, which are cold-stored goods, were traded at 320 yuan. The overall trend is stable.

### Medicinal Materials: Meager Inventory of Northern Gorgon Fruit

Northern Gorgon fruit, or medicinal Gorgon fruit, was previously purchased by Hong Kong merchants at a price of 39 yuan. Recently, due to a decrease in supply, inventory has become increasingly meager, leading to rising prices. Those with a small amount of goods are unwilling to sell them cheaply. The most recent quote is 42 yuan, and a transaction is likely to occur soon.

### The Revitalization of China's Silk Industry

By: De

(A) Past Situation

China's silk exports have declined significantly in recent years. There are two main reasons for this decline: one is the defects in silk production technology, and the other is the declining quality of cocoons. The latter is the most significant reason for the decline of China's silk industry. Twenty to thirty years ago, Chinese silkworm farmers still had their own silkworm eggs, and each region was able to maintain uniformity. For example, Wuxi had the Wuxi breed, Zhuji had the Zhuji breed, and Jiaxing had the Green breed. Similarly, provinces such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, and Shanxi also had their own breeds. The common characteristic of these regions was their ability to produce fine silk of eight to nine or nine to eleven strands, with uniformity and elasticity being the most outstanding features.

However, this situation changed ten to fifteen years ago, primarily due to the import of foreign silkworm eggs. These imported silkworm eggs were often inferior to China's native breeds. Moreover, small-scale rural silkworm farmers lacked scientific knowledge and blindly followed practices, which had a significant negative impact on the quality of cocoons. As a result, China's position in the world silk market has been shaken, with a trend towards extinction.

It would be an exaggeration to say that the loss of the export market is solely due to the poor quality of silk production. Because China has a vast territory, and silkworm farming is an important secondary occupation for the people, it naturally possesses a large number of silkworm breeds. China can rightfully be called the most abundant source of raw materials for silk production in the world, and its silk is among the finest in the world. Unfortunately, due to the lack of organizations for selecting and improving these superior breeds in the past, the situation has deteriorated. Therefore, the key to reviving China's silk industry today is to restore the quality of silkworm eggs. (To be continued)

### Discussing Wharfage Fees

In the past, opium and raw earth entering Shanghai were subject to wharfage fees collected by the Public Works Department in the British Concession, at a rate of four cents of silver per tael. However, the French Concession did not collect this fee. The Bureau relied solely on rent and donations for its expenses. As a result, an Indian man opened a new opium firm specifically within the French Concession in the hope of avoiding this fee. The new Sassoon firm subsequently moved to the French Concession, and now the old Sassoon firm has also moved there. Consequently, the British Concession Public Works Department is now receiving absolutely no revenue from opium wharfage fees. This revenue used to amount to 12,000 taels per year, but the sudden loss of this large sum has made it difficult to operate. It is not known how to compensate for this loss. The British Public Works Department has requested discussions with the French Public Works Department, seeking to uniformly collect this wharfage fee. If allowed, the earth firms would be moved back to the British Concession, and the British Bureau would be willing to share 5,000 taels per year with the French Bureau. However, the French Bureau has refused, stating that the procedures for collecting donations are in place and cannot be changed abruptly.

### Well Excavation Completed

Seven charity wells have been excavated inside the new North Gate of this city. The project has taken several months and cost a considerable amount of money. It is now reported that all the wells have been completed. Each well is lined with two layers of tiles and covered with a flat stone, making them extremely sturdy. This will facilitate water access for residents and provide fire protection, which is truly a benevolent act.

Current Events

### Dawn

By: Xiao Wu

The heat was unbearable. Not only was there not the slightest breeze coming in from the small north-facing window, but the heat rising from the asphalt road was trapping the stifling air inside. Grading papers under a five-watt bulb, sweat poured like pearls from my forehead, cheekbones, and neck, running down my chest. Wiping it with a towel was useless and only delayed my work. Because after grading these papers, I would need at least a few hours of sleep to recover from today's fatigue and continue teaching tomorrow. So I forgot about all the current suffering and focused my mind on the papers.

I don't know when it was, but looking at the pile of decreasing papers, I felt a sense of relief. But suddenly a moth flew in through the window, swooping towards the light. The five-watt bulb was barely enough to illuminate the characters on the page. The moth's circling and swooping caused its large shadow to move across the papers, making the words difficult to see. My eyeballs were also stimulated, causing some dizziness. This sudden entanglement forced me to stop writing. But what should I do with the remaining papers? Should I deceive those innocent children tomorrow, or sacrifice my own sleep? In desperation, I came up with a quick solution: I pulled the light down closer to my head. This way, the shadow it cast did not affect the characters on the papers. But it continued to circle and swoop, mistaking my face and chest for its target. The powdery fuzz from its wings stuck to my sweaty skin, making it unbearable. So I decided to kill it. I folded a newspaper into a paper bag and waited for it to fly into the net.

Sure enough, it was captured by the paper bag, but it was still struggling to fly inside. Because I was eager to grade the papers, I didn't pay attention to its struggles. After I finished grading all the papers, I stretched and sighed with relief. I suddenly realized that the sky outside the window was already showing a pale whiteness. A gust of morning breeze swept through, and this delightful feeling was hard to describe. At this moment, I remembered the moth. I took down the paper bag and saw that it had exhausted its energy and was lying stiffly inside.

The pale white sky gradually brightened, and the five-watt bulb lost its brilliance. I finally breathed a sigh of relief, turned off the light, and lay down on the bed. The cool morning breeze blew in from the window from time to time. Dawn had broken.

Amateur Musings

### Facing the Economic Recession

By: Shi Wei

It had long been pointed out that Shanghai's prosperity was unreliable, meaning it was not a normal development. The reasons for this prosperity were, on the one hand, the past government's unlimited supply of foreign exchange to Shanghai, making it the main import station for China. On the other hand, the population of Shanghai gradually increased with the fall of various cities, especially with the flight of capital, concentrating hundreds of millions of yuan of speculative capital in this corner of Shanghai. This led to hoarding, speculation, and all sorts of unprecedented chaotic situations. But no matter what, it was not difficult for people to see through the bottom of this superficial prosperity. The rise in prices by four or five times certainly brought huge profits to various manufacturers; but it was built on the basis of unprecedented deterioration in the lives of millions of citizens.

Due to the expansion of the European war affecting foreign imports, due to the blockade of seaports affecting Shanghai's exports, due to the tightening control by certain parties, and due to the increase in living expenses forcing a large number of citizens to leave Shanghai, especially the general decline in purchasing power caused by wages not keeping pace with rising prices, the superficial prosperity of Shanghai had reached its end and was now heading towards recession.

Newspapers are already reporting alarming news: over a hundred yarn shops went bankrupt in June, 50% of cotton mills suspended operations in July, 30% reduced staff and salaries, and only 20% maintained their original state. Many chemical factories are operating for seven days and then stopping for seven days. Some enamel factories have stopped operating night shifts. The turnover of various companies is half of what it was before May 2nd. Two medium-sized sock factories and a smaller domestic goods company on Nanjing Road, the commercial hub of Shanghai, are holding closing sales.

Obviously, this is an extremely serious problem.

The bankruptcy of manufacturers and layoffs will further expand the ranks of the unemployed, further worsen the lives of citizens, and in turn make the economic recession even more severe. This will lead to social unrest, damage national strength, and allow evil forces to further exert pressure and temptation.

All citizens of Shanghai should pay attention to this problem, which is closely related to their lives. The concession authorities and leaders from all walks of life are urged to actively plan solutions, and newspapers and magazines should start extensive discussions. We have long felt that this economic recession would come, so we must not bow to it, but rather face it head-on to solve it. The focus of the problem is whether we can work together with one heart and unite to overcome this unprecedented difficulty for the sake of the future of our motherland.

### The Big Shot in Our Alley

— Zhu Xi

"There's a big shot in our alley."

The "big shot" position has been passed down to several people already. The current one sitting on this throne is called Little Pockmark. He's about fourteen or fifteen years old, with a very sturdy body and great strength. Of course, this position was won through fighting, because after the "previous tenant stepped down," many people were vying for it!

Little Pockmark also has several henchmen. These are all children from families in the alley similar to his own. They obey Little Pockmark's every command, mainly because they fear his powerful fists. So, can Little Pockmark just beat up other people's children in the alley, and the parents don't care? Yes, someone is bound to ask this. But you see, Little Pockmark has a very capable older sister! Once, Little Pockmark was causing trouble in the alley again, beating up someone else's child. The child's mother went to Little Pockmark's mother to reason with her. Good! His older sister came out and said, "Little Pockmark was scared away by you. You come with me to find him, and I'll tell Mom to beat him. If he doesn't come back and something happens to him outside, hey! You'll be responsible for it." Then she rattled off a long string of curses. The other person couldn't out-scold her and had to give up.

Little Pockmark himself also has good methods! He doesn't personally hit people; he always instigates his henchmen to do it. And they secretly have an understanding. If someone gets hit and the matter is taken to their own parents, the others will come out and testify, saying, "So-and-so didn't hit him; he's just making it up." Their organization seems to be very tight.

Because we only have one room at home, after the sun rises above the roof in the evening, we have the children bathe and sit at the door to cool off. Therefore, our two children have also been bullied by Little Pockmark and his henchmen, and they had some toys and picture books taken away.

There was a boy surnamed Wang, eleven or twelve years old. Once, when he walked out of the alley, he was stopped by Little Pockmark and his henchmen, who demanded to borrow a dime for passage. When he didn't have it, he was punched several times and went home crying.

Shanghai is truly a strange place, where strange things happen everywhere. As for Little Pockmark, I don't know what his family does. All I know is that he certainly doesn't receive good family education. Perhaps his family even thinks his behavior is something to be proud of, as can be seen from his sister's protection of him. Furthermore, what he usually hears and sees and the idols he admires are probably so-called big shots, right?

It's not necessarily a bad thing for a child to have a desire for leadership, but they need good education to guide them onto the right path!

If Little Pockmark had good fathers, older brothers, and teachers to teach him, he would be a very promising child. (End)

The Hawthorn Detective Case

### The Ballerina's Fate

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Five: Bad News

There were four or five people standing in the telephone room, talking in low voices. Among them seemed to be a hotel employee. I looked towards the direction of the east corridor but didn't see Hawthorn's shadow. Yu Gantang had already gone out through the south gate. Of course, I had no choice but to follow.

I secretly pondered, "Could I restrain him and hand him over to the police? Would this action ruin things? Would Hawthorn agree?"

Annoyingly, I walked to the door and still didn't see Hawthorn. I looked at the parking area at the corner. His car was also gone. Strange, why did he leave me alone here?

I saw Yu Gantang jump into a rickshaw and wave his hand to the west. I felt a little relieved. If he had a car, I might have been forced to take emergency measures and restrain him first. At this time, my most reasonable action was, of course, to imitate him and jump into a rickshaw, telling the rickshaw puller to head west. I was separated from Yu Gantang by two other rickshaws, which was my best cover.

As the rickshaw proceeded towards Jing'an Road, I kept looking to the left and right of the street, hoping Hawthorn would suddenly appear. The result, of course, was zero. I smoked a cigarette while trying to figure out why Hawthorn had suddenly disappeared. Could it be that he also accidentally encountered Zhao Boxiong and was following him? Or did Ni Jinshou have some other important report, so Hawthorn didn't have time to wait for me and had already rushed to the police station? Or—my guesses kept hitting dead ends.

The rickshaw traveled for five or six minutes and gradually left the bustling city. When we reached Heyang Road, the two rickshaws that had been providing cover in the middle diverged separately. My rickshaw and Yu Gantang's rickshaw became directly connected. However, I still told the rickshaw puller to keep a certain distance. The rickshaw then turned south into Changming Road. Yu Gantang had turned back to look once in the rickshaw. I quickly threw away the cigarette butt and lowered my head, assuming he wouldn't see me clearly. However, the situation was very dangerous. After another three or four minutes, as Changming Road was about to end, Yu Gantang's rickshaw suddenly stopped. (77)

Entertainment Circle

### Cao Yu's "Thinking"

— Zou Xiao

Cao Yu became an instant sensation with his play "Thunderstorm," gaining international recognition. He then wrote "Sunrise" and "Wilderness," and his plays were staged everywhere. Recently, his one-act play "Thinking" was completed and has already been staged at the Lafayette Theatre.

This play is well-written and has good color. It takes a different approach, unlike his previous three plays. Wu Jian plays Old Gourd, practically acting as "Kneeling Pond." Anyone who has seen the director's role in "This Is Just Spring" knows his superb acting skills. Xia Xia plays Little Sweet Gourd, which is most suitable. Her voice alone is sweet enough. The few sad tunes of "Little Sweet Gourd, Sweet Gourd is small," are handled with great charm. Wei Zheng's Old Gail's Shandong dialect is incredibly lifelike, half of which should be attributed to the director Xu Sheng. Mei Cun's Teacher Ding vividly portrays a hypocrite who only cleans the outside of the cup and plate. Others, such as Han Fei playing the innocence of Little Baldy, Yingzi playing the coquettishness of Little Red, Vera playing the fast-talking of Lingdi, and Yan Jun playing Li Baochang's official style, all add color to the play. Although it's a comedy, it writes about the lack of appreciation for artists, which is actually a smile through tears. Therefore, I thought that at the end, after the audience dispersed in a chaotic manner, Little Sweet Gourd circling around to hit Old Gourd, and Old Gail and others following along to escape, was such a lively scene. I wonder if it obscured the agitation of sadness. However, if it were changed to a quiet scene, with Little Sweet Gourd simply grabbing Old Gourd's arm again and selling him off, I wonder if it would be incompatible with the previously lively scene, resulting in suppressing the ending, or rather, loosening the ending. I am an amateur when it comes to spoken drama, so I dare not make a judgment.

Performed at the same time as "Thinking" was "The Dumb Wife." Hong Mo's direction made this two-act comedy successful in a slapstick, film-like way. For example, the coordination of singing and movement, and the mechanical nodding and movements of the surgeons, were extremely interesting. Wu Nai, Xiao Feng, Xi Meng, and others' skilled acting won the audience's laughter from beginning to end.

It is said that soon Cao Yu's "Beijing Man" and "Metamorphosis" will also be staged at the Lafayette Theatre. We'll wait and see.

### After Reading "Some Views Offered to the Ping Opera Circle"

(One)
— Jing Lu

After reading Mr. Zi Jia's long article "Some Views Offered to the Ping Opera Circle," I felt endless sympathy. Indeed, what he said was also what I had "wanted to say to the Ping Opera circle in my heart for many years." Now, what general Ping opera critics write is "either praising or scolding randomly," but they have never taken on the responsibilities they should bear.

For example, the need for reform in Peking Opera is universally recognized, but general Ping opera critics insist on sticking to the old ways and criticize the reform of Peking Opera severely. Not only do they not encourage the improvement of drama, but they also hinder it. As for nitpicking on small matters, it is their usual trick. The dispute between Kao Lan and Wang Lan, and the battle between Suo Mansion and Su Mansion, are very clear examples. Who is right and who is wrong will naturally not escape justice, and it is useless to argue unreasonably. But is this where the responsibility of Ping opera critics lies?

Therefore, Mr. Zi Jia's opinion is very correct. Ping opera critics should not nitpick on small matters or peddle dead men's bones, but should strictly point out the big aspects, such as the consciousness of the plot (note: Peking Opera has never paid attention to consciousness, but I think it is an important point) and its rationality, the structure and rhetoric of the script, the clothing that fits the era, and the cultivation and research of acting skills. These are all things that Ping opera critics should discuss one by one. Only then can they be worthy of the three characters "Ping Opera Critic" and the dignity of the title. I would like to follow in Mr. Zi Jia's footsteps and loudly appeal to the Ping Opera circle, asking everyone to change their style!

— Fei Sheng

This publication disclosed the article "Some Views Offered to the Ping Opera Circle" on the seventh of this month. Reading it moved me very much, because I am a member who loves drama. At ordinary times, I want to promote it from the sidelines to make improvements, but my wish is only a wish after all. It is not easy to realize. First, the actors stick to conventions. To give an example, I once published improvement suggestions for "Capturing and Releasing Cao" in this publication last year, and I also spoke to a certain actor, but in the end, no one paid any attention. It can be seen that the conservativeness and stubbornness of the actors is one of the biggest reasons.

Second, newspapers and periodicals, for various reasons, always adopt the attitude of "concealing evil and promoting good." If there is a very frank work that points out a major flaw of a certain actor or corrects an error in a certain Ping opera text, most refuse to publish it. Here, I would like to offer a suggestion to the editor. It is best that the author be responsible for the article, and all troubles can be avoided. I wonder what the editor thinks? (Note) This point is difficult to follow.

Third, criticism must be based on good intentions. For all Ping opera critics who write, the most basic condition is to adopt a completely objective attitude and use artistic arguments. Taking the word "Ping" (critic) as an example, the left side is the word for speech, and the right side is the word for fairness. One must have fair and upright speech to be called a critic. Therefore, neither malicious slander nor blind praise that condones personal feelings is acceptable.

As for the progressive actors who have already automatically improved the plot, costumes, and lyrics, it is not uncommon, and of course, there is also a need to encourage them.

### Spring River's Moonlight Romance: A Glimpse into the Secret History of Polygamy

The long-rumored 20th Century Fox film "Spring River's Moonlight Romance" has been showing at the Grand Theatre since the 15th. The film stars the three major stars Tang Ya Manqi, Andre Lee, and Ya Qiaosheng. The entire film is filmed in color, dazzling and eye-catching, and the story is touching, like a clear and beautiful poem. As for Tang Ya Manqi's acting skills, they have reached perfection, and it is generally believed that it surpasses "The Great Waltz." (The picture below is a scene from the film.)

RKO's romantic comedy "The Secret History of Polygamy" stars Eileen Dunne, Curry Grant, Gan'er Pan, and Patrick Lundoff Scott. It is humorous, hot, and full of hilarious events, and is a wake-up call for polygamy and a warning for womanizers. This film has been showing at the Nanjing Theatre since the 15th. It can be added that the Great Shanghai Theatre will be re-screening "Mirror for Husbands" from the 15th. With the two films being shown at the same time, Asian Film Company may have a plan. (The picture on the right is a scene from The Secret History of Polygamy.)

### Shi Junqing Joins the Great World Qiankun Theatre

— Lan

The famous actress Shi Junqing (formerly Xiao Hanshen) has studied singing and acting in male roles. She has thoroughly studied the Tan and Qi schools. Her appearance is dignified and her singing voice is clear and bright. Her acting is deeply rooted in the word "doing." The expressions on her body and face are excellent, and she is rich in the so-called "acting" art. She has been with the Little Guanghan Theatre for many years, and those who have seen her plays all admire her, believing that she will eventually rise above the common. The owner of the Great World loves her talent and hires her with a generous salary. She will be on stage at the Qiankun Grand Theatre tonight, performing the full-length "Empty City Stratagem." Tomorrow night, "Xiaoyao Ford," and the night after, "Chasing Han Xin," all of which are her signature masterpieces. The right side publishes a recent photo of her in the play "Empty City Stratagem."
