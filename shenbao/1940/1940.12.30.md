### Germany Attempts to Expand the War Zone, Encourages Japan to Launch Southern Invasion, Japan Receives German Raider Ships in Various Ports, Pacific Situation Increasingly Tense, U.S. Extremely Concerned

Manila – Sources within U.S. defense circles here believe that Germany is preparing to spread the war to the Pacific within a few weeks in order to oppose the British Empire and British shipping, and hopes that Japan will immediately engage in war with the United States. U.S. naval authorities here are paying close attention to reports that at least twelve German ships are being armed and are anchored in various ports within Japan and Japanese-occupied areas of China. It is said that some German ships operating from ports within Japanese-controlled areas have been replenishing fuel for German raider ships operating in Australian and Indian waters. It is also rumored that these fuel supply German ships are meeting the German raider ships in certain locations within the Japanese-mandated islands in the Pacific and supplying them with fuel. It is widely believed that the Germans have a plan to launch attacks against British shipping in the Pacific under the guise of assisting Japan's southward advance, and it is believed that Germany will use this as encouragement for Japan to counter the United States by attacking the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, or Thailand. Observers here believe that Germany's ultimate goal is to cause war between the U.S. and Japan in the Pacific within the next few months. Germany hopes that the United States will fight in the Pacific, so that once the United States declares war on Germany, it can prevent the United States from sending its navy to the Mediterranean to help Britain. Defense officials here also recall the recent incident in Kobe port, where the Norwegian oil tanker "Jacob" entered Kobe under the command of personnel from a captured German ship, refueled in the port, and left. Even a protest from the Norwegian Minister to the Japanese Foreign Ministry was ineffective. Reliable sources also said that the German ships "Ragenburg" and "Kembelan" left Japan in October and have not returned to this day. Reliable sources continued, that in addition to the German ships "Elsa Essberger," "Bergenland," "Scharnhorst," and "Ennerich Essberger" anchored in Kobe, "Saarland" anchored in Dalian, and "Elbe Altenwall" anchored in Yokohama, they are constantly supplied with fuel and other necessities. It is also reported that three German ships are anchored in Qingdao, and three more are anchored in other Chinese seaports, all of which can obtain fuel at any time and are being armed. U.S. defense authorities here also said that all German ships in the East could be fully armed by mid-January to form a force for Hitler to assist Japan's southern invasion, acting simultaneously with the German-initiated war in Southeast Europe. This plan is to prevent the U.S. fleet from leaving the Pacific and to cause war between the U.S. and Japan in the event that Britain urgently needs U.S. assistance in the Mediterranean. Reliable sources also say that foreign intelligence indicates that countless Germans arrived in Japan several months ago and that Hitler is pressing Japan to clash with the U.S. when Germany launches in Europe. Naval circles here are also aware that German ships are not only being used to attack British shipping in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, but will also be used as the vanguard for Japan's attack on the Dutch East Indies. The authoritative sources here have also received various reports on the movement of Japanese troops from central and southern China to Taiwan and Hainan Island, and the completion of various preparations for Japan's southern advance. However, authoritative sources pointed out that there is no movement of Japanese troops in Guangdong Province, indicating that the Japanese fear of the Soviet Union has not been dispelled.

Washington - Reliable sources from Manila report that Japan is currently allowing twelve German ships in Japanese ports and Chinese ports under Japanese control to equip themselves with armaments and load food in order to carry out their raiding operations in the Pacific. It is also reported that German ships sailing from Japanese ports are now supplying German ships engaged in raiding in the Pacific. The ports involved in this activity are said to be Kobe, Dalian, and Qingdao. It is rumored that the U.S. Naval Department is closely monitoring this situation and is discussing what impact this would have on Japan's neutral status if the reports are true. Since receiving news of Axis naval activity in the Pacific, people here have been paying close attention to the Pacific and are frequently asking what Japan will do. The fact that the raiding ship that shelled Nauru Island obtained Japan's consent to fly the Japanese flag and use Japanese names, need not be mentioned. However, democratic countries often make loud complaints about any infringement of Japanese rights. It is strange that Tokyo remains silent about the abuse of its flag. (Reuters, 29th)

Washington - Authoritative sources here claim they have no knowledge of any German ship activity in Japanese ports, but added that Friday's attack on Nauru Island has become the first part of an overall Japanese-German collaboration problem. (United Press, 28th)

Berlin - Authoritative sources here refused to comment on reports that German ships are being supplied in Japanese ports. (United Press, 29th)

### Situation of the Shelling of Nauru Island by a German Warship

Manila - Australian Navy Minister Hughes disclosed details of the German warship's bombing of Pleasant Island (i.e., Nauru Island), which is administered by Australia in the Pacific. Initially, the island's residents did not know that the ship was a warship, but they received a warning from the ship that the radio station on Pleasant Island must immediately stop broadcasting, or the ship would take military action. The ship then raised the German flag and opened fire on the oil tanks, but never fired on the people's homes. (Haitong Telegram, 29th)

### The Temporary Soviet-Japanese Fishing Agreement Will Expire Tomorrow, Both Sides Prepare to Reopen Negotiations

Japanese Military Reports Oppose Further Concessions to the Soviet Union

Moscow - The validity period of the temporary Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement will expire on the 31st of this month. It is rumored that the two sides are about to reopen negotiations on this issue. This news was confirmed by a public announcement from the Soviet government. (Havas, 18th)

Tokyo - Regarding Soviet-Japanese relations, the Japanese military's official newspaper, "Kokumin Shimbun," recently published an editorial commenting on the matter, stating, "Soviet-Japanese relations are unpredictable. For example, in the second half of last year, the Soviet Union adopted a tough diplomatic policy toward Japan. Unfortunately, the Abe Cabinet was too weak to cope with the situation at the time. As a result, only the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, and the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, signed a temporary fishing agreement, which, in Japan's view, is the most humiliating diplomacy since the establishment of the Treaty of Portsmouth between Japan and Russia. It is now learned that the terms of this year's fishing agreement will not necessarily be better than last year's temporary agreement. On this basis, it is almost impossible to sign a fundamental treaty with the Soviet Union under favorable conditions. However, we still hope that the future relations between Japan and the Soviet Union can have good development. Some people in the country believe that the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan may promote friendly relations between Japan, Germany, and the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is expected that relations between Japan and the Soviet Union will improve. This theory has now proven to be inaccurate. On the contrary, at this time, Japan should abandon its policy of appeasing the Soviet Union. In other words, its approach to the Soviet Union should be no different from its approach to Britain and the United States. It is hoped that Foreign Minister Matsuoka will follow the Empire's diplomatic path and move forward bravely. It must be known that free fishing is Japan's last resort." "Hochi Shimbun" strongly advocated adjusting relations with the Soviet Union, stating, "If Japan wants to develop its national defense to the highest level and build a 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere,' it must adjust its relations with the Soviet Union on a friendly basis, and then concentrate its efforts on adjusting its internal structure to resolve the 'China Incident' and implement the southward advance. However, diplomatic negotiations with the Soviet Union should not be bound by procedures, but should integrate politics, economics, and military affairs into one furnace to conduct so-called 'total war' diplomacy. In short, the Japanese-Soviet fishing problem is extremely important to Japan, because the total value of fishing in the Northern Sea amounts to 150 million yen per year. Before the Sino-Japanese War, Japan exported 30 million yen worth of canned red salmon to the United Kingdom annually in exchange for a large amount of foreign exchange. The importance of this to the Japanese economy is evident here." (Havas, 28th)

Tokyo - The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" recently wrote an article saying that this is the golden opportunity to adjust Japanese-Soviet relations, hoping that the Soviet Union will quickly establish a fishing agreement with Japan. The newspaper pointed out that the current temporary treaty will expire on December 31, and stated that although the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union tried hard to approach the Soviet Union last year, there has been no progress in Japanese-Soviet negotiations. (United Press, 29th)

### The U.S. Next Year's Budget Is Enormous, Reaching 18 Billion Dollars

Washington - The U.S. government is scheduled to submit a "triple budget" to Congress on January 7, which is divided into a special national defense expenditure of 10 billion U.S. dollars and regular expenses of 7 to 8 billion U.S. dollars. Therefore, the total expenditure for the 1941-42 fiscal year will reach 18 billion U.S. dollars, which is equivalent to the amount used by Britain during the war in 1918. According to the new budget, next year's revenue is expected to be between 7 and 8 billion U.S. dollars, which is sufficient to cover regular expenditures. The 10 billion U.S. dollars in military expenditures will be largely sufficient to implement President Roosevelt's new plan (i.e., to mass-produce military equipment and supplies for Britain to use and collect a small rent). (United Press, 29th)

### Japanese Residents in India Withdraw to Their Home Country

Tokyo - 154 Japanese residents in India boarded the Japanese ship "Kasuga Maru" to withdraw to their home country and arrived here yesterday. Mr. Takamatsu, the director of Mitsui & Co.'s branch office in Karachi, Bombay Province, India, was also among them. According to him, since the Indian authorities have strictly implemented the import permit system, Japan's exports to India have decreased sharply, with the cotton goods sector being the most affected.

### President Roosevelt Delivers a Radio Address, Saying that the U.S. Would Rather Risk Aiding Britain than Avoid War

Washington - President Roosevelt is scheduled to deliver a "fireside chat" tonight. Regarding its nature, the President has given the public a full indication that it will attract national attention. However, the general news reporters have been unable to find out the exact content of the talk from the White House. When entertaining news reporters yesterday, the President avoided answering questions about the content of the talk. What is known to the public is that this talk must be related to the issue of aiding Britain. Isolationists recently criticized the President greatly for publishing a letter from 170 educators and others demanding active measures to defeat the Axis powers, which shows the panic of the isolationists. Therefore, the isolationists' clamor in Congress has made the President's broadcast tonight the key to a major dispute in foreign policy. (Reuters, 29th)

New York - The Karl and Qing Investigation Association recently released voting statistics, showing that 60% of Americans today believe that the U.S. would rather risk getting involved in the war to help Britain than avoid war. (Reuters, 29th)

### U.S. Department of the Army Plans to Strengthen the Air Force in Honolulu, Decides to Send "Flying Fortresses" to Fill the Defense, Another Bomber Squadron Will Fly to the Philippines, Yarnell Ordered to Take on Active Duty

Washington - U.S. Army officials announced yesterday that the Department of the Army has already revised the plan for the 18th Army Bomber Squadron at Wheeler Field in Hawaii. The Department of the Army will soon send giant Army aircraft to fill the defense to replace the existing medium-sized B-18 bombers. It is said that the B-18 bombers may be sent to the Philippines, but Army officials could not know when they could send "Flying Fortresses" to Hawaii, because they will be given to the UK first. He said, "However, we will send these aircraft to Hawaii as soon as possible within the scope of possibility." The Department of the Army also announced that the authorities will establish three new squadrons of the Air Force in Hawaii, namely the 59th Bomber Squadron, the 44th Fighter Squadron, and the 19th Transport Squadron. (United Press, 29th)

Newport - It is said that before his retirement, Admiral Yarnell, former commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, received an order yesterday to go to Washington on Friday to take on active duty. Yarnell said that the nature of his appointment is currently unknown. He has been suffering from a serious cold and has only recently recovered. (United Press, 29th)

Chongqing - The "Ta Kung Pao" recently wrote an editorial suggesting that the U.S. Navy should move to Singapore to implement a blockade of Japan, stating, "If the U.S. Navy takes the offensive, there will be three obstacles. First, if the U.S. Navy takes the offensive, the decisive battle must take place in the Japanese Sea. Japanese aircraft can be dispatched from their land bases to cooperate with the Japanese fleet. The U.S. Navy can only rely on aircraft dispatched from warships or aircraft carriers. Second, if the U.S. fleet moves from Honolulu to Japan, submarines near Japan and various islands between Honolulu and Japan may cause serious damage. Third, if the U.S. fleet uses Honolulu as its base of attack, destroyers and submarines may not be able to be fully utilized due to the distance from the base. Therefore, if the U.S. fleet wants to win, it must proceed to Singapore via the South Pacific, use that place as the main base, and use Manila and Hong Kong as forward bases. Aircraft dispatched from Manila and Hong Kong can provide the U.S. fleet with valuable assistance, and destroyers and submarines will each have a base closer to the battlefield, so that there will no longer be a danger of being intercepted by the Japanese fleet. If the Japanese fleet stays near its domestic bases and adopts a defensive posture, the U.S. fleet can block it and cut off its communication with the outside world. If possible, it can also cut off the connection between Japan and China, isolating its troops in China. This year's poor harvest in Japan means that its home must rely on food imported from China, Vietnam, and Thailand. The U.S. naval blockade will soon force Japan to submit. The U.S. Air Force stationed in Honolulu and the West Coast can prevent the Japanese navy from attacking those two regions. The U.S. fleet can leave Honolulu without hindering it." The newspaper concluded, "Once the U.S. fleet moves to Singapore, Japan's fate will be decided." (Reuters, 29th)

Editorial

### Japan's Next Year's Budget

Japan's 76th Diet convened on the 26th, and then adjourned as usual, to reconvene a month later. Since the establishment of Japan's first Imperial Diet in 1890, for a full fifty years, this year's session may be the most bleak and colorless. But this, in addition to being used to decorate the political season, also has a single important task, which is the passage of next year's budget.

The ordinary accounting section of Japan's budget for this year was prepared particularly late, and was not completed until the 9th of this month, and was submitted to the cabinet for discussion on the 10th, and was hastily passed in just one hour. The total is more than 6.863 billion yuan, which is more than 1.041 billion yuan more than this year's 5.822 billion yuan. This figure is naturally unprecedented in Japanese financial history. According to a statement by Japanese Finance Minister Kawada, "The new budget aims to thoroughly implement the principle of focusing on key points and saving, with the aim of dealing with changes in the international situation and completely resolving the 'China Incident,' so as to enrich military preparations, expand production capacity, and build a highly national defense." Therefore, the expenses of various provinces have generally increased. According to this principle, the provinces of Army, Navy, Agriculture, Commerce, and Foreign Affairs should naturally increase the most, but compared with last year's budget figures, the province that increased the most was the Ministry of Finance, with a total of 31.8 million yuan, followed by the Ministry of Navy with 21.4 million yuan, and the 10 million yuan increased by the Ministry of the Army was only similar to the provinces such as Communication, which is really pitifully weak compared to the U.S.'s huge military expansion budget! Although the expenses of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry have increased, the unproductive consumption has also risen sharply. For example, the public debt interest under the Ministry of Finance has already reached more than 900 million yuan this year, and the increase next year may be even greater than the amount increased by the budget. The 10 million yuan increase in the Ministry of Communications is said to be for the expansion of aviation needs, but the amount of death pensions for soldiers transferred by the province has increased year by year, more than doubled compared to the past. What's more, the purchasing power of Japanese currency is lower than before, and the price of military equipment is rising day by day, so the number of ordinary military and administrative expenses in Japan next year, even if it increases compared to the past, is limited by financial resources and is virtually reduced. Who believes that it can really achieve the goal of enriching military preparations and completing a high level of national defense?

But this is only the ordinary accounting part of Japan's entire budget. As for the temporary special military expenditure budget, which has always been equal in amount to it, it has not yet been announced, and it is said that it will not be determined until next spring. This situation is also different from previous sessions. Although there is no way to speculate on its amount now, judging from the current situation of Japan's war against China, it will not be less than this year's 445 million yuan. Although the Japanese zaibatsu are doing their best to plunder the occupied areas, the income is ultimately limited. In addition, if we add the necessary expenses for preparing for the southward advance, the amount will be even more than this. The reason why it has not been determined for a long time is probably because the southward advance is still in the midst of indecision. It does not want the outside world to see its future direction from the special military expenditure budget, and it does not want to stimulate domestic and foreign listeners with an excessively large number. According to general speculation, in any case, this amount must be higher than this year. Let's take a step back here and assume that it is still at this year's level, then the total of the ordinary budget part has reached more than 11.31 billion yuan. This number is far from being reached by the world's major powers, such as Britain and Germany in the war, and the Soviet Union and the United States, which are neutral. Compared with Japan twenty years ago, it has increased tenfold—that was the peak of the prosperity of Japanese imperialism, but now it is approaching the extreme of poverty. Therefore, how to implement this budget has become a major problem for the Japanese authorities in the future.

According to Japanese statistics, last year Japan's total national income was only 26 billion yuan. Even if it does not decrease next year, the total budget amount has reached 45% of it. This is a rare phenomenon in any country. What's more, Japan's production and foreign trade are shrinking rapidly. The more urgent Japan's desire to expand in the future, the worse the international situation will be, the sharper the national income will be, and the more weakened the ability to bear the burden will be. Looking at the government's revenue items listed on the budget table, there are only 4.2 billion yuan, which is more than 2 billion yuan less than the ordinary budget part, which has been stipulated to be offset by issuing more government bonds. And the 445 million yuan of the temporary military expenditure part (assuming it is still only this number) is completely unsettled. According to Japanese newspapers, it is feared that taxes will have to be increased. In fact, by the end of November, Japan's national debt had accumulated to more than 26.9 billion yuan, and of the more than 7 billion yuan newly issued in the past two years, more than 1 billion yuan has not been digested. The prediction of "national bankruptcy due to public debt" has now begun to show signs. Next year, it has been stipulated to issue another 2 billion yuan. If the special military expenditure item is to be completely offset by government bonds, it is naturally impossible, and the path of increasing taxes is also not optimistic. This year, it has been determined to increase tax revenue, and the income is only more than 2.5 billion yuan, averaging 35 yuan for each Japanese person, which is huge. At this time, the phenomenon of depression is increasing day by day, and it is impossible to increase the burden on the people. In addition to government bonds and tax increases, the remaining outlets are only increasing the issuance of banknotes and absorbing private deposits. However, the total amount of Japanese banknotes issued before September this year was always around 3.3 billion yuan, and by the end of November, it had soared to 3.75 billion yuan. The surface of the phenomenon of inflation has become inevitable. If it is reissued, it will inevitably stimulate price increases and make people's lives more and more difficult. As for the deposit problem, the postal savings that the Japanese government relies on most have been shrinking day by day with the general economic decline, and bank deposits have also decreased. Like the 1 billion yuan savings fundraising plan that the Japanese government touted at the end of last year, it will be difficult to apply it next year. Therefore, although the Konoe Cabinet has been actively promoting fascism to strengthen government control, the people's strength is exhausted, and even if it drains the pond to catch all the fish, it may not be able to cope with the needs of that unprecedented budget.

Japan's budget must be submitted to the Diet for approval as usual, but the parliament does not have the power to veto the budget. What's more, at this time, the constitutional system exists in name only. Even if there are customary questions for embellishment, they will have no effect. Therefore, after the parliament reconvenes next year, there is no problem with the full passage of the budget. But no matter what methods the Japanese authorities adopt to implement this budget, the only result is to deepen Japan's internal and external difficulties to the point of collapse.

### Commander-in-Chief Chiang's Order to All Agencies: Strictly Suppress Stores and Businesses Hoarding and Speculating, Goods Accumulated Must Be Sold Within a Time Limit, Those Who Violate the Order Will Have Their Goods Confiscated and Be Punished by Military Law, Earnestly Protect the Legitimate Business Operations of Law-Abiding Merchants

Chongqing – In order to thoroughly stabilize grain and commodity prices, suppress hoarding, and protect the legitimate business operations of law-abiding merchants, Commander-in-Chief Chiang issued a personal order two days ago, instructing the Ministry of Social Affairs, the National Grain Administration, the Price Stabilization Purchasing and Sales Office, and the Chongqing Municipal Government, among other agencies, to strictly implement certain instructions. The key contents, as gleaned from relevant sources, are as follows: (1) All stores, businesses, and private individuals who are hoarding various grains and essential daily necessities must sell them as much as possible before January 26th of the 30th year of the Republic (i.e., Lunar New Year's Eve) to supply the market and the needs of the people. If it is anticipated that they cannot be completely sold by this deadline and there are still surplus grains and goods accumulated, they should register the remaining quantities separately with the grain management agencies and the Price Stabilization Purchasing and Sales Office or the local competent authorities, accurately reporting the true amount for continued supply and sales. (2) All hoarded grains and goods that are not voluntarily sold within this deadline or are not reported and registered in accordance with the order will be treated as hoarding and speculation. In addition to confiscating the grains and goods, they will be severely punished according to military law without leniency. (3) All those who sell and register in accordance with the order will have their legitimate profits guaranteed by the government. (4) The Ministry of Social Affairs and the Municipal Government should supervise the trade associations of various industries to complete their organization. All law-abiding merchants originally in operation should continue to operate as usual and are not allowed to suspend business, and the government will earnestly protect their legitimate profits in business. (5) Hereafter, anyone, regardless of who they are, who has not joined a trade association will not be allowed to privately purchase and hoard grains and goods exceeding the quantity for personal use, in order to protect legitimate business operations. Those who are hoarding should be handled in accordance with the provisions of item (1) above until the sales are completed. (6) For all grains and goods purchased by central and local party, government, and military agencies, factories, etc., except for public grains and goods that are required for official duties as stipulated by laws and regulations (such as the Military Grain Administration, the Price Stabilization Purchasing and Sales Office, and other agencies), the rest, such as grains and goods purchased for the consumption of employees, must be approved by the grain and goods management agencies or purchased on their behalf, and the appropriate quantity to be purchased and the verification methods should be stipulated. The grains and goods that have already been purchased and stored should also be registered and verified in accordance with regulations to prevent fraud. The types of grains and goods to be regulated in the above items, the temporary profit standards, and other relevant implementation measures should be earnestly discussed and formulated by the relevant agencies, and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation for implementation before the 31st of this month. After this strict rectification and maintenance of legitimate business operations by Commander-in-Chief Chiang, it is expected that the prices of grains and goods in our city and Sichuan Province will gradually return to normal.

Chongqing – A certain company in this city hoarded 10,000 bolts of cloth. After being investigated and verified by the Bureau of Standards, its assistant manager was arrested yesterday, and the manager is at large and currently being pursued. The Bureau of Standards has decided to continue to severely punish this kind of unscrupulous merchant, but will still protect legitimate merchants. Mayor Wu Guozhen yesterday summoned the heads of various trade associations to a meeting, clarifying this intention. The heads of various industries expressed unanimous support and were willing to report those who hoard and speculate, but hoped that a definition of hoarding could be established, namely: (1) those who do not sell within a certain period of time, (2) those who seek illegal profits, and (3) those whose hoarded quantities exceed a certain limit. In addition, it is hoped that this matter can be handled by a centralized agency. (28th Havas dispatch)

Chongqing – The National Government is resolutely implementing policies to curb hoarding and speculation. Many more people have been arrested in recent days. It is reported that there are 19 cotton yarn merchants who have been accused of speculation and hoarding, and many butchers and meat merchants have also been arrested and released on bail. In addition, a certain county magistrate was also arrested for hoarding goods. (29th Reuters dispatch)

### Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation: From the 22nd to the 28th

Chongqing – A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission stated that the war situation in various places this week (from the 22nd to the 28th) has developed to a stage where the Chinese army's attrition strategy has been successful. The details are as follows:

In the Jin-Sui area, the Chinese army in Shanxi Province has been extremely active. They surrounded and attacked the Japanese army invading Pingshun, killing more than 400 Japanese soldiers. The Chinese army then launched separate attacks, depleting the Japanese army's strength. The transportation between Luwei, Huping, Pingwen, and the area between Jincheng, Yangcheng, and Qinshui has mostly been destroyed. Many of the outer strongholds in these areas have been seized by the Chinese army. The war situation in the southwestern Shanxi, Henan and Hebei area is particularly tense. On the south side of Zhongtiao Mountain, on the evening of the 21st, the Japanese army was ambushed in Bazheng Village.

The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. The Japanese army near Jingmen in western Hubei fought with the Chinese army in Guanyin Temple South and Xing Muling and other places. Nearly a thousand Japanese soldiers were killed by the Chinese army. The Japanese army in Yichang shelled Meizixi and Baozigang on the opposite bank, firing poisonous gas shells. The Chinese army was prepared and unharmed. The Japanese army that attacked Zhangjialing from Longquanpu was attacked and killed by the Chinese army, with more than 200 casualties, and retreated. In northern Hunan, the Chinese army advanced to attack Chenglingji and captured many prisoners. Another unit ambushed the Japanese supply train between Chang (Anyi) and Tao (Lin), capturing all the mules, horses, and ammunition. On the 25th, near Yunxi, another Japanese troop train was destroyed, killing more than 100 Japanese officers and soldiers and more than 30 horses.

In the Yue-Gan area, the Chinese army attacked the Japanese army north of Shenzhen and in the Nanto area on the Guangjiu Railway, achieving great results. The Japanese army's attempt to land in Xinhui and Xiantou was ultimately unsuccessful. The Japanese army protecting the road construction in Chaoshan was routed by the Chinese army, and several vehicles were destroyed. The Japanese army attacking Ma Changshan in Dan County was surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese army, and few survived. In Jiangxi, after the Chinese army captured Shenjiapu on the Ruiwu Road, they continued to capture Wengjiapu and pursued the suburbs of Ruichang. The Japanese army stubbornly defended and dared not come out. The Chinese army is still expanding its battle results. The Chinese army in the suburbs of Jiujiang killed more than 300 Japanese soldiers and captured many prisoners in Shili Pu alone, capturing 31 machine guns, more than 90 rifles, more than 600 sets of military uniforms, more than 380 military blankets, many flags and documents, and burned the Japanese warehouse there.

### Nazi Forces Extend to the Black Sea; The Soviet Union is on Strict Alert, Military Control of the Odessa Region; Germany Re-Offers Security Guarantees to Bulgaria

Budapest – According to reports received here today, all foreign ships have been prohibited from entering Romanian ports on the Black Sea under Nazi occupation. This ban coincides with the Soviet Union's declaration of martial law in Odessa. According to this measure, Romania not only prohibits foreign ships from entering all coastal areas of the Black Sea today, but also ordered a reduction in railway passenger transport to expand military transport. At the same time, it also said that the Soviet Red Army's reinforcements are concentrating in large numbers on the Black Sea coast and its vicinity, including the Romanian districts. At the same time, the Odessa region was declared under emergency military control. It is reported that after Germany and Italy opposed the Soviet Union's request to control the mouths of the Danube River and the Bucharest conference broke down, Shabolev, the leader of the Soviet delegation to the Danube International Commission, suddenly rushed to Berlin from Bucharest. This news made the situation in the Balkans even more tense. Neutral diplomatic circles believe that Germany may launch an attack on Britain and Salonika simultaneously in February next year.

### Turkey's Foreign Policy is Willing to Cooperate with Neighboring Countries to Maintain Peace in the Balkans

Ankara – Turkey's foreign policy shows an absolute state of peace at the end of this year. The negotiations between Turkey and Bulgaria are still proceeding diplomatically, and the situation has eased, and the result of repairing old friendships may be obtained. Turkish newspapers are promoting close cooperation between the Balkan countries. Although Turkey's attitude has not changed due to British pressure, the British ambassador's talks with the Turkish president were about commercial matters and did not involve political issues. What was discussed was the shortage of British goods transported to Turkey. Britain's attempt to drag Turkey into adventures in Syria also failed. Turkey's unwillingness to participate in foreign political events is that the war against Britain has reached a decisive period. Turkey's domestic policy is to pay attention to the government's power and the laws to protect the country's economic life, so that the government can implement its policies to command the country's economy and finances.

### Italian Prisoners March Through the Streets of Athens: Where is Caesar's Mighty Spirit Now?

Athens: An international news agency reporter stood on the sidewalks of Athens with the Greek people for over an hour to watch Mussolini's fascist legions parade through the streets of Athens. They traveled ten miles from Baeniaus to Athens, but this procession was not to boast of their victory; they had no glory to speak of. No one dared to hold their heads high; they were merely seen as ragged, dejected, and disillusioned troops, a defeated and broken army with unkempt hair and dirty faces. Most of them were young men, between the ages of 22 and 26, all belonging to the Italian elite forces. The reporter gave several cigarettes to two of them and spoke to them. One, named Falini, was from Florence, and the other, named Masca, was from Trieste. Both were members of a suicide squad. Falini told the reporter, "We never expected such an outcome. But the past is past, and the Greeks are treating us well, which is somewhat comforting. Our soldiers, even the officers, believe that the war is over and that continuing to fight is pointless. In reality, almost no one wants to fight; we are just following orders." Mussolini's army marched through Athens like a flock of domesticated sheep, not like the fierce wolves and tigers of Caesar's legions. (International News dispatch, 29th)

### "Guangyuan" Ship Sold to Australian

Chinese Crew's Successful Struggle; Three-Year-Old Case Resolved

San Francisco: The case of the Chinese two-masted ship "Guangyuan," which has been stalled here for a long time, has now been resolved. The ship has now been sold to Sir Carpenter of Australia and will serve in the South Pacific. The three-year-old case has finally been resolved.

In 1937, the ship was sold to a Japanese businessman to transport US$64,000 worth of scrap iron from the United States to Japan. However, war suddenly broke out, and the Chinese sailors on board unanimously refused to work, and the Chinese Consulate General also refused to issue the ship a license, resulting in a lawsuit between the two parties. Finally, the US Supreme Court ruled that the ship should be judged by the Chinese Consul.

All French people, no matter where they are, what their position is, or what their thoughts are, if they all rise up and fight, we are willing to follow them without any conditions. Any French leader, no matter what mistakes they have made in the past, if they draw their swords and rise up again, they will see all of us following without any ambition.

### Qin Bi Gao Injured on the Field, Tung Wah Suffers Unprecedented Defeat Yesterday; First Division League: French Business Wins 4-1; Li Yichen Scores Penalty to Salvage One Goal

The ever-victorious Tung Wah football team suffered its first Waterloo in the First Division League yesterday morning, losing 4-1 to French Business, an unprecedented defeat. The score was 1-1 at halftime, with Li Yichen scoring a penalty for Tung Wah. Otherwise, the entire army was defeated. Yesterday's game was the second round of the First Division. There were over two thousand spectators at Yiyuan. In the first round, Tung Wah won 2-1. Yesterday, Tung Wah performed abnormally. New player Chen Yutian was out of sync, and the forward line was like a pile of loose sand. Qin Bi Gao was injured early in the game, so his performance was not as good as before. Qin cannot escape blame for the first two goals conceded. French Business, on the other hand, took advantage of their victory over St. Francis, and played skillfully. Forwards Bouthiaux, Djimwater, and Piaut were fierce and good at fighting, and the defense was impenetrable, leaving Tung Wah at a loss and creating an upset. The lineups of both sides were as follows:

French Business Association

Pain Remy

Rossel, Collet Bel, Pan Kou Lai, Schreger

Smith, Djimwater, Bouthiaux, Milov, Appleyard Goff

Tung Wah Association

Qin Bi Gao

Li Ning, Zhuang Youren

Liang Shutang, Huang Kehou, Han Longhai

Wu Binghao, Li Yichen, Chen Yutian, Fei Chunhua, Jia Youliang

Penalty Kick Ties the Score

Tung Wah kicked off. Collet blocked it and took the opportunity to attack. Appleyard Goff got the ball and hooked it in. Smith headed it off target. Before long, Appleyard regrouped. At an opportune spot, he raised his foot and shot. Qin jumped up and hit it, but collided violently with Bouthiaux and fell injured. Qin, severely injured by this, tried his best to fight, but his performance was abnormal. Twenty-five minutes in, Appleyard shot from outside the box. Qin Bi Gao blocked it but was not steady, and Bouthiaux rushed up and poked it in. Tung Wah conceded the first goal. After that, Tung Wah tried to attack many times, but failed to score. At thirty minutes, Wu Binghao had an excellent opportunity, dribbling straight into the penalty area. The French Business defender was outside and could not catch up. Binghao intercepted the ball and shot at close range, a few yards in front of the goal. Because he was too hasty, he shot over the crossbar. The spectators all regretted it. Five minutes before the end of the first half, Pan Kou Lai fouled Li Yichen in the penalty area and was called for a penalty. Li Yichen kicked the ball and it fell into the net, tying the score (1-1). Soon after, the first half ended, with the teams evenly matched.

The Second Half Sees Three More Goals Conceded

After changing ends, Tung Wah got two corner kick opportunities, but failed to capitalize on them. Djimwater came forward and kicked the ball, and the Tung Wah goal was breached again (1-2). After ten minutes of melee, Tung Wah's attack was strong, but they all missed by a hair. At twenty-five minutes, Bouthiaux got the ball and passed to Smith, who pulled the trigger, Qin Bi Gao dived but could not save it (1-3). In the last minute, Bouthiaux repeated the trick, getting the ball from Appleyard Goff and passing it to Smith, who scored easily (1-4). Tung Wah lost two goals in two minutes, and their morale plummeted, making them play even more slackly. Although there were one or two shooting opportunities, they were all easily saved by the opponent. When the whistle blew, Tung Wah suffered a crushing defeat of 1-4.

### The Future of the Sino-Japanese Currency War – Original Title: Regarding "Third Type of Paper"

— Gu Liaozhai

On Christmas night, Bohe Ong's relatives and friends celebrated Ong's birthday with toasts. I, a humble one, drove to offer congratulations and met with gentlemen such as Xi Qiao, Jian Xiang, Qing Shi, Shao Qiu, Bao Rong, Qiu Wei, and An Lun. Old friends and new acquaintances, happily gathered at a feast. Amidst the clinking of glasses, there was no shortage of stories of heroic deeds in troubled times. Discussions ranged from ancient times to the present, focusing on the "Reserve Bank Notes" of Jiangning, with opinions converging from various angles. Xi Qiao, in a humorous manner, referred to it as the "Third Type of Paper." Returning home, the memories of what I heard were still vivid in my mind. I hastily tried to record them, but I only managed to capture less than half. Although it cannot compare with the previous symposiums held by this publication, it is still sufficient to provide fodder for conversation after tea and meals.

The Bride and the Concubine

Xi Qiao… "Federal Reserve Notes" are the "First Type of Paper," "Hua Yu" is the "Second Type of Paper," so the new product from Jiangning, being launched with much fanfare, should be the "Third Type of Paper,"... (Laughter). But each generation is worse than the last!... (Laughter)

Qiu Wei　Don't forget the military scrip.

Xi Qiao　Although they are similar in nature, they are different in form.

Bao Rong　Japan has always opposed it because it will affect military scrip. Military scrip is Japan's only source of funds for paying soldiers and buying Chinese local products. Why is it being stirred up now?

Shao Qiu　None of the four types is useful; none is qualified to affect the other! The Japanese military's objection is just to restrain Jiangning; North China is using this to squeeze out Jiangning and maintain the "Federal Reserve Bank"; the "Hua Xing" troops already have power and position in the new organization, so it doesn't matter. The real opponents of the new plan are Japanese businessmen and more insightful intellectuals. Figures in the Kasumigaseki diplomatic circles also do not express sympathy. Japanese zaibatsu are even more against it. Actually, regardless of who opposes it or who supports it; no one has a definite solution. The problem is that the power of the legal tender is too great, but Japan is desperately poor. To obtain Chinese local products and seize the wealth of the Chinese people, it is necessary to use legal tender. Although their opportunities and possibilities for collecting legal tender are not small, they are ultimately limited. The limited income is not enough for the endless needs, so they often want to create a tool that can be endlessly exploited. "Federal Reserve Notes," "Hua Xing Coupons," and military scrip have been tried repeatedly and have failed repeatedly. They cannot even be used generally in the markets of the occupied areas. When they are forced to be accepted under duress, prices are raised; therefore, their value is actually lower than that of legal tender. Moreover, those without a violent background must pay with legal tender. To ensure that the raw materials they buy are more standardized and convenient, Japanese merchants would rather raise a sum of legal tender first before trading, which is quite ridiculous. When they are eager to buy raw materials, they often use legal tender payment as an advertisement to lure brokers and win over sellers. The more tricks they play, the more expensive the prices in the occupied areas become. As a result, Japanese merchants face even greater difficulties. High costs for Japanese merchants affect domestic prices in Japan. Japanese price policy is at a loss, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is often criticized by all sides as mediocre and incompetent. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry knows that what the military is doing is wrong, but the military prides itself on "exploiting material resources." However, Chinese local products are transported to Japan through the hands of Japanese merchants. Therefore, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and even the Ministry of Finance, must take some consideration of the interests of Japanese merchants in China. To guarantee the interests of Japanese merchants in China, there is no other way but to admit that the prices quoted in Japanese yen cannot be too far from those quoted in military scrip or legal tender. Otherwise, Japanese merchants in China will suffer too much, and their interest in shipping goods back to Japan will also be greatly reduced. The Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry cannot sever the causal relationship between prices in the Chinese occupied areas and those in Japan. In recent months, they have tried every possible way to raise the price of military scrip so that Japanese merchants in China can use military scrip to buy goods, slightly reducing their costs, and ensuring that they do not suffer too much when shipping goods back to Japan. However, the effect of raising the price of military scrip can only be seen at the ticket windows of a few controlled railways and highways. Once it reaches the commodity market, it is still bleak and colorless. Therefore, they are now fantasizing and reversing their obstruction of the new "Central Bank" plan and permitting it. However, their purpose is exactly the opposite of ×××. They intend to use the "Third Type of Paper" as a "sacrificial lamb."

Qiu Wei　Japan has tried many ways to raise the price of military scrip. They even considered how to reduce the issuance so that military scrip would be used exclusively for paying soldiers and for the Japanese military in China to purchase materials, reducing other uses. Therefore, in September of this year, they revealed seven measures: (1) Not approving the establishment of new enterprises in China; (2) Requiring prior application for the construction of civil engineering projects in China; (3) Restricting Japanese people from coming to China; (4) Restricting remittances to China; (5) Strengthening trade control between the occupied areas and the rear; (6) Implementing a licensing system for all profit-making businesses; (7) Raising the price of goods shipped back to Japan, etc. But the result only showed the intensification of the conflict of interest between Japanese merchants in China and Japanese merchants in Japan. The real purpose of these measures is only to maintain the preferential interests of Japanese merchants already in China and prevent competition from those who continue to come to China. After September of this year, the value of military scrip rose sharply for a time, which was said to be the result of a large-scale speculative activity authorized by the Japanese military to a certain Japanese commercial bank. It bought heavily around seventy-seven yuan, and general speculators dumped heavily; when the time came, a short squeeze occurred, and they realized they had been tricked and washed their hands of it. Therefore, when the Japanese commercial bank wanted to unload at a high price, there were no buyers, resulting in today's situation of "there is a market but no transactions." Because this kind of speculation is more dangerous than other kinds of speculation. It is easy to buy, but there are no counterparts to sell to. As for harming the country and the people, it goes without saying!

Jian Xiang　Professor Yu, you said that Japan intends to use the "Third Type of Paper" as a "sacrificial lamb," and that its price can only be raised at the ticket windows of trains and buses. Once it leaves the window, it cannot compete with legal tender. Therefore, it wants to create a "competitor" that is destined to fail, so that the price of military scrip can be a little bit stronger than another "currency" in the market of the occupied areas. Therefore, ×××'s plan is the ideal "sacrificial lamb." Moreover, according to their wishful thinking, the "Third Type of Paper" is linked to legal tender at par, so the sacrifice of the "Third Type of Paper" should also sacrifice legal tender at the same time. But the ghostly "Hua Xing Coupons" were also "linked at par" with legal tender when they were first issued; legal tender is still legal tender, and "Hua Xing Coupons" ultimately could not escape the fate of a ghost and died young. The fate of the "Third Type of Paper" will be no different.

Xi Qiao　The concubine must be inferior to the bride, otherwise it would be embarrassing to appear inferior! This policy must be used even more when the bride is ugly!... (Laughter)

The Difficult Birth and Future of the "Third Type of Paper"

Qing Shi　The monthly expenses of the Jiangning organization have increased from ten million to sixteen million, which is the inevitable result of rising prices. However, the so-called income is only five or six million to ten million per month, with a monthly shortfall of seven or eight million. They repeatedly asked the Japanese to allocate some of the financial resources, such as permits to move goods out, to them; but what they received was too little. Most of the income from kidnapping and other activities goes into private pockets; issuing permits to move goods out also only benefits a few people, and those who are not relatives or friends cannot buy them. Monkeys don't want to go to orchards that don't bear fruit. Issuing non-convertible banknotes is easier than making wax fruit products after all. But wax fruit products can still be used as decorations; of course, they can be forced upon the people in the occupied areas. However, issuing non-convertible banknotes is a complete waste of time. Therefore, although the so-called "Provisional Measures for Reorganizing Currency" stipulate that all expenses of "government agencies" should be paid in the "Third Type of Paper," it also adds a sentence "not applicable in specific areas for the time being." This is clear proof that they themselves do not want it. Therefore, I dare to assert that the outflow will inevitably equal the entire inflow in the future. Just like today's military scrip, the entire amount issued is almost entirely on the books of Japanese commercial banks. The Japanese are patting themselves on the back, thinking that this is the success of the military scrip policy, thinking that it has become a "reserve currency." Little do they know that this is precisely the price they have obtained for selling Japanese goods several times that amount in the Chinese occupied areas. No wonder Japanese merchants and Chinese people are both complaining bitterly.

Qiu Wei　Don't say that merchants are complaining, even the Japanese government is complaining bitterly. The Japanese military in China uses military scrip to pay soldiers and forcibly purchases goods in the occupied areas. As soon as merchants in the occupied areas receive military scrip, they try their best to turn it into goods. The markets in the occupied areas have become markets for Japanese goods. Therefore, as a result of dumping Japanese goods, they have received the military scrip issued by the military. If Japanese goods were not continuously sold to China, military scrip would have no way out; the price of military scrip would inevitably plummet. However, Japan is suffering from a shortage of materials and a shortage of foreign exchange; in order to obtain foreign exchange, it comes to China to dump goods. As a result, it has backfired on itself, which is truly laughable. Therefore, Japanese merchants have witnessed the failure of "Federal Reserve Notes," "Hua Xing Coupons," etc., and at the same time discovered the greatness of the value of legal tender, so they have always advocated using legal tender, maintaining legal tender, and opposed the issuance of military scrip. They really hate "Third Type" and "Fourth Type" even more. ××× has racked his brains and run his legs many times for the "Third Type Bank," always exchanging enthusiasm for cold air; this is also one of the main reasons.

Shao Qiu　Yes! Yes! The material shortage in Japan has now reached its peak. On the one hand, it feels that exports to China are not profitable, and on the other hand, it encounters overseas markets rejecting Japanese goods; therefore, it is always dreaming of one day thinking of a plan to fully seize Chinese local products with very few materials, or even without the need for materials. Raising the price of military scrip may be one of the means of their current plan. But the market at the ticket window of the Zhabei Railway Station is too small; the Japanese commercial bank that was ordered to conduct multi-head speculation in September and October of this year is still spinning around in a market with transactions but without trade, unable to get rid of it. Wanting to create another sacrificial lamb to replace the fate of military scrip will inevitably make the circulation area of military scrip narrower, because the places where military scrip can flow can probably also flow to the third type of paper. The places where military scrip cannot flow, the third type of paper certainly has no hope of flowing to. Therefore, although no one is qualified to affect anyone, mutual squeezing is inevitable. This is another reason for exchanging enthusiasm for cold air. Now, ××× is not only making concessions to military scrip, but even making concessions to "Federal Reserve Notes," no longer trying to monopolize the right to issue currency in the occupied areas, only to exchange for a "yes." However, North China was designated as a "Federal Reserve Note area" long ago, and Central China and South China were designated as military scrip areas long ago. "Federal Reserve Notes" in North China still cannot compete with legal tender to this day; it is only because the Japanese military in North China does not issue another type of banknote itself that it can be forcibly circulated at the points and lines where the Japanese military is stationed. As for Central China and South China, the Japanese military is unwilling to give up its existing territory for military scrip, and its territory is really pitifully small; in other words, it can only be active in the ticket offices of a few major stations along the railways and highways; it cannot intervene beyond that. The failure of "Hua Xing Coupons" was because it had no territory. The fate of this "Second Type of Paper" cannot escape this fate. In the past, the "Hua Xing" side also repeatedly asked the military to give it some territory. The Japanese military, with great generosity, allowed the customs to collect "Hua Xing Coupons." However, the Chinese still pay in legal tender, and the "Renovation" side is afraid that merchants will pay taxes in "Hua Yu Coupons" and affect their "finances," so they also welcome legal tender. However, when paying taxes, they first convert it into customs gold units according to the market price of "Hua Xing Coupons," with the purpose of implementing a disguised tax increase. The fate of the "Third Type of Paper," at best, can only inherit this legacy of "Hua Xing Coupons"!

The Future of Foreign Exchange and Countermeasures

Xi Qiao　Professor Liu, you are eating vegetables alone, that won't do. I want to ask you, what will happen to foreign exchange?

An Lun　It's just creating an opportunity for speculative friends.

Jian Xiang　Two major events before Christmas had a significant impact. Sterling quickly soared from five thousand six or seven hundred yuan to six thousand six or seven hundred yuan; the US dollar shrank from more than five yuan eight corners to around five yuan three corners at once. Prices of all goods have started to rise, and everyone is very panicked.

An Lun　What everyone is panicking about is not what great tricks the "Third Type of Paper" will play; what they are worried about is the National Government's counter-offensive strategy. HSBC's low quotations have made people even more frightened. In fact, the purpose of the National Government's counter-offensive, regardless of the strategy it adopts, is to strengthen the position of legal tender. People in the market originally knew this. They also know that there is no problem with legal tender. It's really contradictory!

Jian Xiang

They are all fishing in troubled waters; there is no contradiction at all.

An Lun　Isn't it contradictory to let the fish go and then catch it? It's easy to let go but difficult to catch; foreign exchange has been increasing in recent months; the withdrawal of American expatriates and the imminent Pacific War have made foreign exchange bulls panic. Why are speculators so forgetful? The current international situation is more tense than before, the uses of foreign exchange are narrower than before, and the foundation of legal tender is even more solid after the establishment of new loans from the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. They seem to have forgotten all these ironclad facts!

Xi Qiao　That's right, who can guarantee that the peace of the Pacific can last a few more days? By then, foreign exchange can only be admired like a stamp. The fate of Shanghai is also uncertain, and no insurance company will insure goods against being confiscated.

Jian Xiang　What should we do then?

Shao Qiu　What are you worried about? (Laughter) This kind of thing is not worth paying attention to; even if we have to pay attention to it, I believe the country has already made preparations. Moreover, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are by no means fools; when lending money to China, they will definitely think about being speculated on.

Jian Xiang　What everyone is worried about is that the government will abandon maintaining the Shanghai foreign exchange market again. If the supply stops, the exchange rate will inevitably shrink again

Xi Qiao　So foreign exchange shrinks and prices rise. Isn't that just making trouble for yourself?

Jian Xiang　If you don't stop supplying foreign exchange, you can't prevent others from speculating. If you want to reduce the possibility of others speculating on foreign exchange, you can only let the exchange rate fall further. Speculators have no conscience to speak of. As long as there is money to be made, sacrificing national interests is nothing to them. Even businessmen, predicting that the exchange rate will shrink and prices will rise, must prepare in advance; you can't say that they are making trouble for themselves.

Xi Qiao　Speculating on foreign exchange requires preparing a large amount of legal tender; it has no way to circulate, how much legal tender can it get?

Jian Xiang　If he comes to speculate, what can we do?

An Lun　We really don't know what to do; and it is not appropriate to speculate. However, in fact, there are all kinds of ways to deal with it. Leaving aside other things, let me just give one example: why can the black market for sterling in the New York market be eliminated? As long as we obtain the cooperation of those with power in the international exchange market, we can prevent the depletion of foreign exchange resources on the one hand, and still keep the exchange market stable on the other.

The Shanghai foreign exchange black market arose after China implemented exchange control policies. Because at that time, the cooperation of British and American banks was not obtained, not only did they not cooperate, but they also publicly announced the termination of the gentleman's agreement they had concluded in the past. If British and American banks had cooperated with China's exchange policy at that time, the black market would never have arisen; even if it did, it would never have shrunk to this point today.

Jian Xiang　Can we cooperate now?

An Lun　No one can predict how the country will deal with the "Third Type of Paper." This is just my personal guess. Comparing the international situation now with the past, I think it is very possible to obtain this kind of cooperation.

When China implemented the legal tender system, everyone knew that it was linked to sterling. Therefore, the US dollar and legal tender were only opponents in exchange, not companions in exchange. When China implemented exchange control, Britain, under Chamberlain's appeasement policy, was unwilling to bind its diplomatic freedom with a monetary alliance against Japan; even after the establishment of the Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund, it only aimed at stabilizing the open exchange market and did not actively assist the control policy. Failure to actively strengthen exchange control and actively crack down on exchange speculation, only starting from stabilizing the open exchange market, naturally could not prevent exchange speculation. If we want to reduce exchange speculation, we can only use a bitter trick and let the exchange rate fall. If we strengthen exchange control, there is no need to maintain the exchange market, and the exchange market will not move slightly. Stabilizing the exchange market without distinction is really not a very sound method. However, China's exchange control, if it does not obtain the cooperation of friendly countries, then it can be said to be impossible in Shanghai, where international relations are complex, especially in Shanghai, which is generally a quasi-occupied area.

The international situation is now much better than the past attitude of Britain and the United States towards the Far East. They have fully understood that China's victory and the interests of Britain and the United States in the Far East are inseparable. Britain and the United States inevitably had some competition over China's monetary policy in the past. This is also one of the reasons why China's exchange control failed to obtain international unity. China and the United States are cooperating in all aspects, and their interests in the Far East are even more consistent. The only area that was less cooperative in the past was monetary policy. Because China's legal tender policy was not consistent with the purpose of the United States' implementation of the silver movement. Although the United States did not give the legal tender policy active cooperation, it still gave friendly assistance, such as the signing of the Sino-US Silver Agreement and so on. However, the monetary relationship between China and the United States did not enter an alliance period until the United States lent China one hundred million yuan, and only lingered on friendly assistance. However, this loan unprecedentedly declared that it would be used to assist China's legal tender. This is unprecedented. It can be seen that the monetary relationship between China and the United States, which was the only one that did not enter the stage of cooperation, has now laid the foundation for an alliance. Then the problem is much simpler when China needs to strengthen exchange control.

After the supply of foreign exchange is managed, the legitimate commercial needs are fully supplied, and speculative activities and speculative attempts have nowhere to use their tricks. At that time, the black market for legal tender in Shanghai will be like the black market for sterling in New York, which can be eliminated very quickly; and the exchange rate will inevitably stabilize at an appropriate level from then on.

What Offensive Does the "Third Type of Paper" Have?

Jian Xiang　But there are always some dangers in Shanghai. Will the Jiangning side copy the "Federal Reserve Note" policy of forced exchange to gradually seize the legal tender in everyone's hands?

An Lun　Of course, there is this possibility, but when there is this possibility, it is not just the legal tender in everyone's hands, but also the goods, gold, foreign exchange, and even lives that you hoard, none of which may be confiscated. But this depends on the fate of Shanghai. But what power does it have to determine the fate of Shanghai?

Shao Qiu　Shanghai's wealth lies in commerce. Destroying Shanghai's security is a foolish act of killing the goose to get the eggs.

Qiu Wei　The third type of paper, like others, ultimately aims to destroy legal tender. But legal tender will not suffer the slightest damage. The people of Jiangning also know this; therefore, its issuance still copies the old method of the failed "Hua Xing Coupons" being "linked at par" with legal tender. If China wants to deal with it, there will be a difference between the past and the present. In the past, we defeated "Hua Xing" with a bitter trick because the foreign exchange level was still high at that time; now, there is no need to do so. I think Professor Liu's observations are very likely.

Jian Xiang　Will the "Third Type of Paper" sneak into the Shanghai Concession?

Shao Qiu　Have "Hua Xing Coupons" and military scrip ever sneaked in? Have you ever seen them in the market? Its only use is to buy train tickets. In addition, it can't even buy a pack of matches; those with a national concept will naturally not accept it; those without a national concept will not accept it for the same reason because they especially love money. If you have this kind of paper money by your side, do you have the face to show it to others? In short, it cannot destroy legal tender, but it hinders its ability to extract social wealth; as for relieving its own financial difficulties, it is nothing more than a pie in the sky. When considering practical benefits, it may also find that a single move is worse than remaining still?

——December 28th——

China's Deed Tax

On the 18th of this month, the National Government promulgated the "Provisional Regulations on Deed Tax," consisting of seventeen articles, which came into effect on the date of promulgation. It stipulates that in areas where the future Land Law and Land Tax are implemented, the transferee of real estate, whether through mortgage or sale, must obtain a deed and pay the deed tax. The details are as follows:

Deed Content: Divided into three copies: a stub, a copy for verification, and the deed itself, each with a unique number on the perforation. It should clearly state the type of land, the boundaries, location, and area, the number of rooms in the house, the sale or mortgage price, the date of agreement, the parties to the deed, the names of the witnesses, and other necessary information.

Deed Format: To be determined by the Ministry of Finance.

Deed Fee: Fifty cents in national currency per deed.

Deed Tax Rate: (1) 5% of the sale price for a sale deed; (2) 3% of the mortgage price for a mortgage deed. If a property is first mortgaged and then sold, the original deed tax paid for the mortgage can be used to offset the sale deed tax, but only if the mortgagee and the buyer are the same person with the same name.

Tax Payment Period: The transferee must pay the deed tax within four months of the contract's establishment.

Various Penalties: (1) Penalty for late payment: If the tax is not paid within four months of the deed's establishment, in addition to being ordered to pay the tax, a fine of 10% of the tax payable will be imposed. For every two months of further delay, an additional 10% will be added until the total fine reaches the full amount of the tax payable. However, if the deed tax cannot be paid on time due to force majeure within the prescribed tax payment period, a statement of reasons can be made, and if verified to be true, the penalty will be waived.

(2) Penalty for concealing the deed price: If the sale price or mortgage price is concealed, in addition to being ordered to replace the deed, truthfully correct the information, and pay the tax due, if the understated sale price is below 20%, a penalty of half the amount of the underpaid tax will be imposed; if it is between 20% and 50%, a penalty of the full amount of the underpaid tax will be imposed; if it is above 50%, a penalty of twice the amount of the underpaid tax will be imposed.

(3) Penalty for not using a deed: If a deed is not obtained and used in accordance with the law, in addition to being ordered to pay the deed fee and obtain a deed, a fine of one to five yuan will be imposed.

Deed tax is a type of tax levied on the certificate established when the ownership of real estate such as land and houses is transferred through sale or purchase. The certificate must be submitted for inspection and registration in order to determine and guarantee the ownership, hence the tax payment. Deed tax is only collected when real estate is transferred, so it is a temporary opportunity tax. In financial terms, it is a type of registration tax within circulation taxes.

China's deed tax developed very early. In the Shunzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty (1647), it was stipulated that for every tael of silver paid for land and house transactions, a tax of three fen was levied. From the 16th year of Kangxi (1677) to the 21st year, deed taxes were successively established in provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, and Jiangxi. In the 7th year of Yongzheng (1729), it was approved to add one li to the three fen per tael of deed tax to be used as funding for the examination halls. The subsequent development is yet to be examined. In the third year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Deed Tax Regulations" and the "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Deed Tax Regulations," and there were also revised "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Deed Tax Regulations." In the fourth year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Finance approved the issuance of detailed rules for deed forms. In the fifth year, special zone deed tax regulations were announced. These regulations have been adopted by various provinces to this day. Although some provinces have their own deed tax regulations, they are generally the same in principle. According to the regulations, the buyer or mortgagee of real estate must, within six months of the establishment of the deed, bring it to the relevant tax authority for inspection and registration. Deed forms are issued by the county governments, or the contract text is written on officially sold deed forms, or affixed to official deeds. The fee for deed forms ranges from several cents to one or two yuan per form. At the time of inspection, a deed tax must be paid: the sale deed tax is nine percent of the deed price, and the mortgage deed tax is six percent of the deed price. If the property is first mortgaged and then sold, the original deed tax paid for the mortgage can be used to offset the sale deed tax, but only if the mortgagee and the buyer are the same person.

Although the content of the "Provisional Regulations on Deed Tax" promulgated this time is not significantly different from the past, there are slight differences in terms of tax rates, deed forms, and tax payment when compared with the aforementioned regulations. In terms of tax rates, the sale deed tax is reduced from nine percent to five percent, and the mortgage deed tax is reduced from six percent to three percent. In terms of deed forms, the fee is set at fifty cents. In terms of the tax payment period, it is reduced from six months to four months. Although the tax rates are reduced, the tax collection techniques have been tightened. This is because excessively high tax rates easily lead to tax evasion and underreporting of sale prices to reduce the tax payable. Now that the tax rates are lower and heavy penalties are imposed on tax evasion and underreporting, transferees are more likely to be willing to pay taxes to quickly establish ownership and gain protection.

The income from deed tax was originally collected by the various counties and remitted to the central government. However, during the Beijing government era, the provinces often retained it. Therefore, in the second year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Finance drafted a "Draft Law on National Taxes and Local Taxes," which classified deed tax as a central government tax. However, due to practical difficulties, it was never implemented. After the establishment of the National Government, it was determined to reorganize the tax system. In November of the 11th year, the "Standards for the Division of National and Local Revenue" were promulgated, based on the spirit of balanced power between the central and local governments. Because deed tax was related to land tax, it was reassigned to the provincial governments as a major source of revenue for the provincial governments. Later, in November of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the "Standards for Handling Budget Revenue and Expenditure Classification" were promulgated, which still classified deed tax as a local tax. In the "Financial Revenue and Expenditure System Law" promulgated in July of the 24th year, it was stipulated as a tax of the county or city subordinate to the province, but it was not called deed tax, but rather property tax, and it was stipulated that it would be merged into the land improvement tax after the Land Law was implemented. Although the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System Law has been expressly ordered by the National Government to be temporarily suspended during the extraordinary period, the "Provisional Regulations on Deed Tax" promulgated this time still carry out this approach, stipulating that the deed tax is collected by the county and municipal governments.

### Bank Closing Tomorrow

An additional exchange has been added. The Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee has decided to add an exchange for year-end closing. A circular has been sent to each exchange bank stipulating that in addition to the existing exchange at 3:15 PM, a second exchange will be held at 4:45 PM. The handling of collection receipts will remain the same.

### Sugar Prices Slightly Tight

Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight rebound in tightness. The guild quoted prices as follows: Spot No. 24 coarse white foreign warehouse old goods arriving in September were 78.5 yuan, July were 78.1 yuan, and mid-January orders were 79.5 yuan, all with a good recovery. Spot Dutch red sugar was 64.1 to 64.2 yuan, up 0.2 yuan, and mid-January delivery was 64.5 yuan. Taikoo car white B mark West Warehouse was 78.5 to 78.1 yuan, opening day orders were 78 yuan, DY mark West Warehouse new goods were 76.5 yuan, old goods were 75.8 yuan, and HY mark West Warehouse new goods were 76.5 yuan.

### Codonopsis pilosula Suddenly Surges 20 Yuan Due to Depletion

Recently, due to frequent purchases by various gangs, the market for Codonopsis pilosula has been feeling increasingly depleted. For example, the price of Zhoushan goods, which was previously sold for 145 yuan, now requires 165 yuan. Ningbo goods have also risen to 125 yuan, a 20 yuan increase compared to the previous period. If the source is not replenished, further increases should be prevented.

### Exciting News at Year-End: American Air Force Volunteers Arrive in China, Coolidge Ship Has Already Carried Some People to the Philippines, Several More Batches Will Arrive in the Far East in Succession

Since the announcement of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the United States, in order to cope with the international situation, has ordered and encouraged overseas Chinese in the Far East to evacuate. Special postal ships, such as the Monterey, have been dispatched to carry overseas Chinese back to the country, as reported in previous newspapers. Now, the evacuation of overseas Chinese is considered to have come to an end.

Sympathizing with China, Voluntarily Joining

However, there are still quite a few Americans residing in the Far East. In the future, when necessary, the US government will continue to send ships to evacuate them. It is reported that the Coolidge President, a US presidential liner, is coming from the US to the Far East. Because 500 American volunteer air force pilots sympathize with China and are willing to serve in China, part of them have already arrived at the Philippines on the ship. Therefore, the ship sailed directly to Little Luzon. It is reported that this is the first batch, and there are four more batches waiting for the opportunity to come to China.

Original Ship to Shanghai, Returns to US on New Year's Day

Now that the ship's mission is complete, it has departed from Little Luzon and come to Shanghai via Hong Kong. It is scheduled to arrive at Wharf Nos. 11 and 12 at 2:30 PM today. Passengers will transfer to small launches at 3:30 PM and dock at the Customs Pier. The postal ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 2:00 AM on the first day of the month to return to the US. The last launch for passengers will depart from the Customs Pier at 1:00 AM on the first day of the month. At that time, the curfew will be in effect, making movement on the road inconvenient. Therefore, there will be a launch departing from the Customs Pier at 9:00 PM on the 31st (evening). The passenger cabins on the ship returning to the US have already been fully booked.

Two Hundred Missionaries Ordered to Return Home

More than two hundred American missionaries and their wives in China have decided to return to the country on the Coolidge ship. Most of them are members of the Presbyterian Church. When the State Department ordered the evacuation of overseas Chinese, the missionaries in China expressed a firm attitude to strictly adhere to their positions. Even if the situation was extremely urgent, they would rather go to the Chinese interior than return to the US. Later, the General Assembly of the American Church specially sent Bishop Roberts to Shanghai to preside over and supervise the evacuation of the missionaries. He explained the importance of the overall situation and urged the missionaries that if there was no need to stay in China, it would be better to support the national policy and return to the country as soon as possible. The evacuation of more than two hundred people this time is due to this reason.

Reissuing Evacuation Orders Next Spring

In addition to the Coolidge President, there will be two other ships, the President Pierce and the President Taft, departing from Shanghai for the US around the 6th and 20th of next month. All second and third-class cabins have been almost fully booked, but there are quite a few remaining first-class cabins. Another batch of more than one hundred missionaries will leave China on these two ships. However, ordinary overseas Chinese are still taking a wait-and-see attitude. It is generally believed that the US State Department may issue another order in March next year urging overseas Chinese in the Far East to return to the country. At that time, the situation may be very different from now.

### Japanese Merchant Murdered a Year Ago, Still Framing People

Arresting Zhang Wengda, Insisting He Was the Murderer

Nagata Toraji, a Japanese merchant selling goods at No. 6 Dekang Lane, Qiujiang Road, is fifty years old. He travels between Suzhou and Changzhou from time to time. On October 15th last year, he took a car with a Korean, Jiang Biwen, thirty years old, to Changzhou. They then took a rickshaw to Shiru Field outside the West Gate of Changzhou, where they were shot by guerrillas with a handgun. Nagata was shot in the head, chest, and abdomen in three vital areas and died on the spot. Jiang was only shot in the neck, but was seriously injured. Unexpectedly, a year later, the Japanese military police arrested a person in Changzhou and accused him of being the murderer. According to the Japanese newspaper, he was originally a special operations team member of the Changbei Brigade in Wujin County, named Zhang Xinda, twenty-four years old. He had recruited soldiers or collected information for the guerrillas.

### Three People Allegedly Arrested After Miyazaki's Assassination

After Miyazaki Satoshi, a police officer at the Japanese Consulate, was stabbed to death with a sharp knife on Zhonghua Road, Wenmiao Road in the Nanshi district late at night on the 20th of this month, according to Japanese newspaper reports, three Chinese people have been arrested. One is He Guoyao, twenty-five years old, who was arrested at the Lvbao gambling den on Luxiangyuan Road. The others are Xu Atang, twenty-five years old, and Cai Qingyuan, thirty years old, who were arrested while loitering in front of the Tongqing Hotel on Tongqing Street.

### Two Men of a Certain Nationality Attempted Kidnapping, Each Found with a Handgun, to Be Transferred After Investigation

Yesterday morning, the Central Police Station of the French Concession dispatched a Chinese, Western, and Vietnamese patrol team. At around 7:00 AM, while patrolling on Avenue Joffre, they saw two men of a certain nationality who looked suspicious. They immediately searched them and found a handgun on each of the two men. They were all taken back to the police station for interrogation. It is said that the two men were planning to kidnap a certain Chinese person. After a thorough investigation, they will be handed over to the relevant consulate for review.

### Dr. Baker Departing for Hong Kong, Expected to Arrive in Shanghai in Mid-January

Dr. Baker, General Secretary of the American Red Cross, departed from Hong Kong for Guilin on the 12th of this month, and then went to Chongqing, Guiyang, and other places to inspect the lives of the people in Free China and distribute medicines. According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, Dr. Baker has scheduled to depart for Hong Kong via Shaoguan today after completing his official duties. After spending the New Year in Hong Kong, he is expected to arrive in Shanghai in mid-January. In addition, the export procedures for rice and wheat from the American Red Cross to aid refugees in the occupied areas of Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, etc. have been completed and are already being shipped. They are expected to arrive and be distributed soon.

### Gaussmuth to Arrive in Shanghai on New Year's Day, Plans to Transfer to Tianjin and Then to Beiping

French Ambassador to China Gaussmuth, after arriving in Chongqing, immediately paid visits to the central authorities. Now that he has completed his official duties, he left Chongqing on the 28th with his entourage Dairel. He will take a plane to Shanghai via Hong Kong. According to the itinerary, he is expected to arrive in Shanghai on New Year's Day. He will stay in Shanghai for a short time and then plan to take a ship to Tianjin and then to Beiping to visit his wife and children who are currently living in Beiping. British Ambassador Kerr was originally planning to return to Shanghai before Christmas to visit his wife, but this was cancelled due to the increasingly close diplomatic relations between China and Britain. In addition, American Ambassador Johnson and Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin also decided to stay in the capital to celebrate the New Year and maintain close contact with the Chinese government, as various countries' aid to China has become more active.

### Guangci Hospital Employees Request Salary Increase

Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road is established by the French Municipal Council. All employees in the hospital, totaling more than 150 people, have requested the hospital to improve their treatment due to the soaring prices and the increasing difficulty of life. Therefore, yesterday, they publicly elected seventeen representatives, including Jin Kuansheng, to petition the hospital director and put forward eight conditions as follows: 1. Increase wages by 50% for those below 10 yuan, 30% for those below 20 yuan, and 20% for those below 30 yuan. 2. Rice subsidy of five dou of white rice per person. 3. Double pay at the end of the year. 4. Housing subsidy of 10 yuan per person, except for those who live in the hospital. 5. Half a month of vacation per year, and wages will be paid separately if no vacation is taken. 6. Wages shall not be deducted in case of illness. 7. Improve meals (only cleanliness is requested). 8. Employees shall not be dismissed without cause, etc. It is reported that the hospital authorities have not yet given a formal response.

### Private Parcels from the Occupied Areas Allowed to Be Exempted from Import Licenses

The Ministry of Finance telegraphed the following: "It has been verified that for prohibited import items sent by parcel post from the occupied areas to private individuals, if the value is less than five customs gold units and there is no suspicion of commercial activity, import will be allowed. The customs shall verify the tax payment and inspect the goods, and no import permit is required."

### After the British Merchant Yongfeng Ship Imported, It Was Detained for Inspection

The British merchant Yongfeng ship of the Moller Company was sailing from Fuzhou, Minhai Port, back to Shanghai on the 24th of this month. When it was outside the port, it encountered a Japanese warship that attempted to board the ship for inspection. However, because the ship was sailing very fast, it was unable to stop it. The Japanese warship then telegraphed the Shanghai-based navy to report. When the ship sailed into the Wusongkou on the 27th, it was detained by the Japanese navy at the Astronomical Observatory Wharf, and personnel were sent to board the ship for inspection. However, the ship was only carrying fruits and had no other prohibited items. The ship was released yesterday morning, but it had been detained for two days.

### Tomorrow is the End of the National Calendar Year, the Financial Situation is Stable, the Scope of Speculation is Narrow, the Money Market is Ample, Silver and Money Industries will Open on the Fourth

Tomorrow is the end of the 29th year of the Republic of China, and the silver and money industries are handling the final accounts. The banks have completed the interest settlement for savings, commerce, and other departments. The money houses have rushed to handle the annual settlement and will all be closed for three days from New Year's Day, opening for business on the fourth. Shanghai's overall finances remain as stable as ever. The low interest rates on money houses prove that the money market is ample, and all industries have passed through peacefully. Compared with the last period, the current financial state seems more stable. The notable aspects are as follows:

Return of Floating Capital

Since the extension of the war, the outflow of funds has been inevitable. However, since the expansion of the European war in May of this year, the state of currencies in the European belligerent countries has changed. The Axis powers announced the pact, the United States actively reorganized its army, and the situation in the Pacific gradually presented a turbulent and uneasy image. Funds that used to flow to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia have poured into this port in large quantities, and the money market has become very loose. Exchange remittance fees have dropped to below two yuan, almost disappearing.

Lower Interest Rates

With the easing of the money market, interest rates naturally decrease. During this period, commercial banks generally reduced the interest rate on demand deposits by one li. The Joint Reserve Treasury of Shanghai's silver and money industry uniformly reduced interest rates for its member banks and money houses. After the commercial banks successively reduced interest rates, depositors did not make large withdrawals, and the market showed a stable but loose appearance. The four national banks, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank, and the Communications Bank, did not reduce interest rates.

Rising Public Bonds

After the Ministry of Finance declared its determination to maintain creditworthiness, the national consolidated bonds of the 25th year of the Republic of China successively rose to new highs not seen since the August 13th Incident. Not only did domestic bonds rise, but foreign bonds also rose. In the London market, various Chinese foreign bonds rose by one and a half to five pounds each. For example, the Rehabilitation Public Bonds once fell to 18 pounds in October, but now have risen to 34 pounds. As for the principal and interest of domestic bonds, they are allocated and paid on time in designated funds and have never been delinquent.

Foreign Exchange Fund

Since the completion of the US loan to China of 100 million US dollars, of which 50 million US dollars were used to stabilize the legal tender for Sino-US financial cooperation, followed by a British loan of 10 million pounds. Remembering that since the "May 2nd Incident," the British government stated that it needed US cooperation to maintain Chinese legal tender, this can now be realized. The foundation for foreign exchange has been laid, and confidence in the legal tender has been strengthened. However, the regulations for the method of use are still awaiting agreement between the two countries.

Speculative Fear

The Shanghai financial commodity market has not been prohibited from speculative activities due to the temporary lack of authority of the Chinese government. However, compared to the past, its scope has narrowed. Due to changes in international relations, operators of foreign currency and foreign stocks have become wary after the "May 2nd Incident." The black market for foreign exchange has been stabilized under the maintenance of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee. Speculators in various markets are quieter compared to the last period.

### The Three Countries Cooperate in Textile Exchange to Cope With Abundant Resources, Song Ziwen Discusses With British and American Authorities to Support the Smooth Operation of the Exchange Market

Regarding stabilizing the exchange rate of legal tender and preventing exchange arbitrage, China, Britain, and the United States will take cooperative measures on a technical level. This news was revealed by British economic circles in this port. The London telecommunication news yesterday reported that Song Ziwen, chairman of the Bank of China, British Minister of Finance Phillips, and the American authorities are discussing in Washington ways to jointly support exchange rates and are progressing very smoothly. This mutually confirms that there is no doubt that China, Britain, and the United States are cooperating on financial technology to maintain common interests. According to inquiries from banking circles, British and American banks in Shanghai have deeply rooted influence, and Shanghai is the center of the Chinese economy. China has the cooperation of British and American authorities in Shanghai and more exchange funds. The situation caused by the issuance of unapproved banknotes can be adequately dealt with. Recently, the black market exchange rate has gradually eased. After the new year, it will not be difficult to maintain the original state.

### The Cooperative Association Strives to Promote the Establishment of Small Amount Rice Purchases Yesterday, Elected Staff, a Large Amount of Foreign Rice Will Arrive Next Spring

The Shanghai Food Cooperative Association has been preparing for more than a month to promote the purchase of small amounts of rice by groups, and it has been fully prepared and formally established a few days ago, and began purchasing. The association held an inaugural meeting yesterday and elected ten supervisors, including Xi Yushu, Gui Yanfang, Hu Mingshan, Chen Lianzhang, Sun Ruihuang, Yang Bogeng, Yuan Hesong, Li Zulai, Wang Huanzhang, Ding Xuenong, and Cui Fuzhuang. Fifteen directors were elected, including Pei Yunqing, Chen Panjun, Yan Esheng, Yin Zibai, Xu Zhiyi, Zhang Wenkui, Chen Yisheng, Jin Zhixuan, Qian Qiling, Zhang Jusheng, Lu Xiuyuan, Lv Tieying, Ai Zhongquan, Hu Xuantong, and Dong Guoqing, to be responsible for overall management. All the revised regulations for purchasing rice on behalf of others will be officially announced within days.

Motives for Launching

An official of the association stated that the people's food situation will become more and more serious if this continues. We cannot bear to sit idly by and therefore, without fear of hardship, initiated the organization of this association and decided to fully promote the purchase of small amounts of rice by groups. Small-amount regular households purchasing one to five bags of rice can be given preferential treatment. The association plans to raise a huge amount of cash from enthusiastic people in the community and will prepay the funds on their behalf. Therefore, at the time of ordering, only half of the payment needs to be collected, and the full amount must be paid when the rice arrives. The Federation of Silver and Money Industries and the Yiyou Society have been entrusted to handle the matters on our behalf. In short, the association's motives are all for serving the community and stabilizing the people's food supply.

Rice Arriving Next Spring

According to news from the Shanghai rice industry yesterday, the Norwegian "Merchant" ship was delayed until 8:00 AM this morning, berthing at the Hongxing Wharf in Pudong. The ship is loaded with 50,000 bags of Saigon foreign rice. Most of the rice is No. 2 rice. It is said that it was ordered by foreign firms such as Heyi, so the number of spot codes in the rice market will inevitably increase, and the market situation will become more stable. According to another source, around January 15th of the new year, 150,000 bags of foreign rice may arrive in port, and a large batch of Yangon foreign rice, about 200,000 bags, was loaded onto ships at the Yangon production area a few days ago. It can be transported to Shanghai at the end of January or early February. Therefore, rice prices will inevitably fall sharply at the beginning of the year.

Han Zhengping Talks

Rice prices in the city are rising day by day, and price limits have been violated. The authorities have difficulty suppressing this, and the lives of ordinary people are becoming more difficult. According to Han Zhengping, Shanghai is originally an industrial and commercial area, and the city's food has always relied on imports from other ports. The transit was extremely convenient. The suburbs are under control, and foreign exchange is shrinking day by day, resulting in the monopoly of hoarders. Fortunately, the authorities caught up quickly, and the trend of grabbing rice spread. However, due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange and rising gold prices, the rice market secretly offered price cuts and secret transactions, which violated the price limits, which is very regrettable. It is verified that there is actually no lack of rice in the city. According to the Jianghai Customs Report, the import of foreign rice this year has reached 3.6 million dan. In addition to what has been consumed in the past eleven months, there are still 1.3 million bags of rice. This is only in terms of the amount of foreign rice that has been imported this year. Therefore, if the rice merchants in the city can all abide by the law and not be greedy, the secret price increase trend will naturally be suppressed.

### Zhenhai Fellow Townsmen's Fundraising Conference Raised 130,000 on the Spot

Then, donations were made on the spot, and the donations were very enthusiastic, totaling 131,000 yuan.

### The Association for the Relief of Women and Children Broadcasts a Promotional Campaign

The China Association for the Relief of Women and Children has been experiencing increasing difficulties in maintaining its operations due to the reduction in donations from the authorities of the two concessions and from all walks of life in recent years, coupled with high prices. Now, the association is taking advantage of the 30th anniversary of its establishment to hold a fundraising and promotional campaign. It has been decided to broadcast fundraising for three days starting the day after tomorrow (New Year's Day), to appeal to all walks of life. The details are as follows:

A poster was also produced, depicting the tragic scenes of abducted and lost women and children, with the words "Separation of Flesh and Blood, Heart is Like a Knife, Quickly Donate Money, Merit is Immeasurable" at the bottom, which is a warning and eye-catching. The association has asked major cinemas in the city to insert this promotional item before the screening of the main film and will publish a special issue commemorating the 30th anniversary of its establishment on New Year's Day to promote widely.

### Tushanwan Opened Yesterday

Tushanwan in Xujiahui, west of Shanghai, is an important route to Songqing and Shanghai-Hangzhou. Hundreds of pedicabs and vendors transporting cigarettes, cloth, and kerosene pass through daily. Previously, the area was closed by the Japanese, who used barbed wire to seal off the front of the former Catholic Church Defense Corps site, prohibiting vehicles from passing and conducting thorough searches, causing difficulties for nearby factories transporting goods. After the 19th, work was suspended, but it is now known that it suddenly reopened yesterday.

### Japanese Actively Competing for Seats on the Board of Directors; British and Americans Cannot Ignore Their Base. According to the Land Regulations, the British and Americans Are Not Falling Behind. The Japanese Are Attempting to Reform the Electoral System to Secure Victory.

Although the election for the next term of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Board of Directors is still more than three months away, the Japanese, learning from their defeat in the previous election, are carefully and actively preparing for the next election. Taking the Japanese Residents' Association as its mainstay, it is implementing all plans that are conducive to the election. It is also launching a counter-offensive campaign against the British and American League. When the reporter from the Pingming News Agency inquired with various relevant parties in the Shanghai Municipal Council about this issue, no one expressed optimism about the next election. Some even stated that it was difficult to predict who would win or lose in the next election.

Japanese Attempt to Change the Electoral System

The Board of Directors Election Committee organized by the Shanghai Municipal Council is composed of foreign taxpayer representatives from various countries, including Britain, America, Germany, Russia, and Japan. Its main purpose is to handle the procedures for the Board of Directors election. It is one of the subcommittees of the Shanghai Municipal Council and has already held six meetings. In the most recent decision, last Tuesday, the Japanese representatives proposed an important motion, attempting to overturn the current electoral system and make a thorough reform, with the number of seats on the Board of Directors being determined by the population size. The committee believes that it does not have the authority to change the Land Regulations of the Foreign Concessions, leading to a deadlock. The meeting was originally scheduled to end after the sixth decision, but now its date must be extended again.

British and American Assets Are of Significant Value

As for the British and American fronts and the number of votes for the Japanese in the next election, both sides have now begun taking steps and methods to win votes. To increase the number of votes, the Japanese are dividing their taxpayers who own large amounts of real estate or have excessive tax obligations among non-real Japanese residents without tax obligations, and are doing everything possible to increase the number of Japanese votes. As for the British and American residents, their real estate in the Public Concession is far greater than that of the Japanese, and the taxes they pay to the Shanghai Municipal Council are also more than those paid by the Japanese. According to the Land Regulations, the British and Americans should not be disappointed in the next election. However, since the European War, a large number of American residents have been summoned to leave Shanghai and return home. In addition, the American residents are gradually withdrawing, which has inevitably slightly affected the votes of the British and American residents.

### Savings Association Holds New Year Savings Promotion; Concession Residents Who Want to Purchase Savings Certificates Can Entrust Banks to Purchase on Their Behalf

Since the launch of the National Savings for National Construction movement, it has been extremely smooth, and the results in various places have exceeded the predetermined savings amount. Now, the General Association has launched a New Year savings promotion movement, stipulating that from New Year's Day of the 30th year of the Republic of China, all parts of the country have been ordered to comply. The Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, as well as banks in various provinces and cities, have recently issued National Savings for National Construction Certificates. Due to the special environment in the Shanghai Concession area, the banks have not issued savings certificates, but residents who want to purchase savings certificates can entrust banks to purchase them on their behalf from Hong Kong.

### Ordinary Alert for Three Days Starting on New Year's Day

The police authorities of the two concessions in this city have recently intensified security in the territory in order to maintain good public order as the end of the year approaches. The enforcement of the curfew in the Public Concession has been stricter than before in recent days. The police and patrol officers inspected and repaired the barbed wire and other roadblocks set up on various roads and non-essential lanes. In addition, the two concessions will take ordinary alert for three days on New Year's Day (Wednesday) in the 30th year of the Republic of China. In addition to increasing the number of police officers and patrol cars, the roads on the borders will remain open as usual and will not be closed.

### Large Number of Undelivered Parcels in Haiphong to Be Shipped This Year

Regarding the large and small parcels sent from Shanghai to various provinces and cities in the Southwest, due to the impact of the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the parcels that had been received could not be delivered and were mostly stored in the warehouse of the Haiphong Post Office, totaling 20,000 to 30,000 items. Most of these parcels were sent to Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Kunming, and other places, and two-thirds were daily necessities. Although the Haiphong Post Office had taken good care of them, the items were stored for too long and in large quantities, inevitably being exposed to moisture, resulting in a small number of parcels being damaged by moisture. Since the Burma Road was officially opened, the Post Office immediately negotiated with the authorities to send special postal vehicles to transport the large number of undelivered parcels from Haiphong. The Parcel Business Section of the Shanghai Postal Administration learned that these parcels would be shipped in full this year. Fortunately, due to the careful storage, there were only a small number of items that were rotten or damaged. Once all of these parcels have been shipped, the Shanghai Post Office will be able to resume receiving large and small parcels from various provinces and cities in the Southwest. It is expected that there will be a crowd of people delivering these parcels at that time. In order to avoid any impact at that time, the procedures for delivering these parcels will be changed, or registration will be done first, so that the procedures can be avoided when receiving and sending them.

### Gunshots Fired at Huasheng Gambling Den

At 9:45 p.m. the night before last, someone suddenly fired three gunshots in the open space behind the Huasheng Gambling Den on Haig Road in Xujiahui, west of Shanghai. The employees of the gambling den, hearing this, mistook it for a robbery and turned on the alarm light. The alarm bell rang loudly, and the iron gates outside were immediately closed. The male and female gamblers were panicked. Later, a large number of armed police officers were dispatched from the Jiaotong University Xujiahui "Police Station" to the scene to suppress the situation and investigate where the gunshots came from, but the shooter had already fled.

### Flower Vendor Chen Maojian Abducted a Fellow Vendor and Extorted a Huge Sum of 1,000 Yuan. The Incident Was Exposed, and He Was Arrested by the Police and Prosecuted.

Chen Maojian, a local resident residing at No. 3 Touba Road, has been selling flowers in the Hongkou Small Vegetable Market without a permit. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Council Engineering Department discovered this and arrested him on the 24th of this month, ordering him to obtain a license. Unexpectedly, Chen vented his anger on Yao Hongsheng, a flower vendor from Pudong in the same market, believing that he had informed the Shanghai Municipal Council License Department. That afternoon, he invited four people, including the rogue Xiao Shaoxing, to beat him up. Not content with this, at 10:45 a.m. on the 27th, these people hired a car from Yitai Car Company and went to the Small Vegetable Market. Without asking any questions, they handcuffed Yao Hongsheng and dragged him into the car, speeding to a teahouse near the iron gate of Nanyang Bridge in the French Concession, extorting 1,000 yuan to settle the matter. As a result, Yao wrote a note promising to pay 100 yuan to compensate Chen for the license fee and the confiscated flowers. At that time, Yao's wife had reported the information to the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Chen Maojian and bring him to the police station. Xiao Shaoxing and others, upon learning that Chen had been arrested, released Yao and fled in different directions. The criminal Chen was sent to the First Special Court yesterday. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and requested a postponement. Then, the victim Yao Hongsheng testified about what had happened. When questioned, the defendant's testimony was evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be remanded in custody for further investigation.

### Leather Bag Containing Eight Pounds of Opium Valued at 5,000 Yuan; Transporting Opium and Robbing Opium Both Prosecuted

On the afternoon of the 27th, at 1:20 p.m., Jiang Derong and Liu Amao, opium traffickers from Yangzhou, were carrying eight pounds of opium valued at 5,000 yuan in a leather bag, walking near Yuan Chang Road on Broadway, when they were surrounded by four rogues, Zhou Lichun, Song Ziming, Deng Yonglin, and Chen Guangjing, who robbed the opium. At that time, Chinese detectives Wang Shubei and Song Jiabao happened to pass by and arrested both sides, along with the opium, and took them to the Hongkou Police Station for detention. Yesterday, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the police were prosecuting them for transporting opium and robbing opium, according to the criminal law. The defendant Jiang Derong said that the opium was given to them by Diao Chunzi, a chief steward on the Lushan Maru ship, and that they were transporting it from Tianjin to Shanghai to be temporarily stored at No. 7 Zhiyu Lane on Jiujiang Road, intending to transport it to Hankou, etc. The truth is unknown. He requested a postponement of the case to investigate the truth and arrest the principal offender. When questioned, Jiang Derong confessed that Liu Amao had asked him to temporarily send the leather bag to a certain place on Jiujiang Road, and that he did not know the details, begging for leniency. Liu Amao said that the opium belonged to Diao Chunzi, a friend of the chief steward on the Lushan Maru ship, and the rest of his testimony was evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation.

### On the Small Vegetable Market

— Lin Huo

Early morning——Perhaps it's very early for you, when the maids in the gentlemen's rooms carefully push open the bedroom door and walk in gently. They add pieces of coal to the stove with a rustling sound, pour a pot of ginseng soup from the "Five Watches Chicken" clock on the mahogany table, and bring it to the gentleman's bedside. The gentleman leans half-way up, and the concubine helps you put on your clothes, drink the ginseng soup, and then sleep with the concubine for an hour or two. Or perhaps the young mistresses, lying in bed, instruct the old maids standing respectfully outside the door to buy some delicacies for the young master sleeping next to you. At that moment, when the students of our alley's primary school have finished their first class and are happily playing hide-and-seek in the courtyard, and the workers in the Gongsan Factory have already worked for more than two hours, I would like to ask the gentlemen, ladies, young mistresses, and concubines to grant me a favor, and instead of going back to sleep, put on your silk-cotton clothes and long-haired coats, and let me lead you on a short walk in such an early, cold morning. On this road, I guarantee there will be no kidnappings, because kidnappers would never think that gentlemen would come to this road. However, the ground is very wet, so don't forget to wear leather shoes and bring a handkerchief sprinkled with perfume.

Coming out of your room with the stove burning, it is indeed very cold outside. After walking through the quiet alley and turning a few corners, you are already in a not-so-orderly "lane" residential area. Your cars may have sped through here before, but the rapid speed didn't give you time to carefully observe the messy arrangements inside those houses. Look in the direction I'm pointing, the window of that two-story building is hanging a "small vegetable cupboard," as if it's about to fall down and hit pedestrians on the head. Over there, a manure cart is parked, the sound of washing the toilet is not very pleasant, and the smell is also hard to bear, quickly take out your perfume-soaked handkerchief. At the corner of the turn is a fried dough stick stall, next to it is a glutinous rice ball stall, next to it is a fried tofu vermicelli stall, and then down the line are all tightly packed stalls. At this intersection, there are several patrol officers standing, like they are watching your houses, holding very thick rattan whips.

This is already the small vegetable market, it's very noisy, isn't it! Gentlemen are used to the sounds of gongs and drums in theaters and the "pong chak" sounds in dance halls. Although this is also a loud sound, it is probably not very comfortable. Over there at the entrance of Lu Gaojian, snow-white meat is hanging. Gentlemen must be wondering why those people holding small vegetable baskets in one hand only look at the entrance and don't run in to buy meat.

The stalls are all kinds, with vendors ranging from seventy or eighty-year-old men to five or six-year-old girls. Many people are crowded together, even fighting over a radish or a small handful of bean sprouts.

People buying shiny hairtail are shouting loudly to each other, gathering a large crowd. Everyone is enviously flipping through the hairtail, but very few will agree on a price and buy it. Most people retreat from the crowd with their eyes wide open.

Gentlemen say that those things are really unhygienic, all scooped up by hand, unlike your chefs at home who are so clean, using knives and forks for everything. I tell you, if you can't eat anything, don't blame me, the things gentlemen eat are bought like this.

Gentlemen express sympathy for those ten-year-old vendors, but wait, a little girl selling vegetables at a large stall is being beaten by a patrol officer over there! Probably because she doesn't have a permit. Originally, in addition to fulfilling their protective duties for gentlemen when necessary and copying numbers in various alleys, their most outstanding masterpiece is still on the small vegetable market. Seeing a stall without a permit, they lift their leather shoes and kick over the vegetables or bean sprouts in the basket with one foot, and after kicking it over, they will step on it hard a few times, and then send the empty basket and the vendor kneeling next to it and kowtowing repeatedly onto the truck, fining them three or five yuan.

Gentlemen have finally deigned to give me face, but the small vegetable market is not finished yet. But never mind, it's very windy outside!

### Fourteen Kinds of Goods Allowed Free Import to Increase Raw Materials for Inland Flour Mills, Yarn Mills, and Cloth Factories

The Executive Yuan has issued a circular to the provincial and municipal governments and chambers of commerce, stating that fourteen kinds of goods, regardless of their origin from any country or any place in the country, shall be allowed free import: (1) Rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, wheat flour, biscuits, miscellaneous grain flour; (2) Cotton, cotton yarn (not exceeding 23 counts), cotton cloth (the cotton yarn used for warp and weft is not exceeding 23 counts); (3) Steel and hardware materials; (4) Machinery and tools; (5) Transportation equipment and accessories; (6) Communication equipment and accessories; (7) Cement; (8) Gasoline, diesel, lubricating oil; (9) Medical supplies and treatment equipment; (10) Chemical raw materials; (11) Agricultural insecticides; (12) Salt; (13) Alcohol; (14) Gunny bags. For the fourteen kinds of commodities that have been opened, no proof is required, and all are allowed free import. Exported goods from the occupied areas, if they are the above-mentioned opened goods, shall be allowed to be released. In terms of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, cotton yarn not exceeding 23 counts and cotton cloth using yarn with warp and weft not exceeding 23 counts shall also be allowed to be released. However, other products will still be prohibited. It is reported that the National Government's opening of fourteen kinds of goods is to take into account practical needs and facilitate consumption. For example, the opening of wheat, cotton, and cotton yarn is to avoid the lack of raw materials for inland flour mills, yarn mills, and cloth factories.

### Overseas Chinese in the United States and the Philippines Are Eager to Show Their Patriotism and Compete to Purchase Aviation Bonds, Reaching More Than 7 Million

According to people from the United States, since the government promoted the sale of aviation national salvation bonds overseas, overseas Chinese have enthusiastically subscribed, and the results have exceeded expectations. At present, the Americas have subscribed for more than 6.3 million US dollars, and the Philippines has also reached 1 million Philippine pesos, which shows the patriotism of overseas Chinese and their concern for the construction of the motherland. A vegetable farmer in Vancouver poured out his life savings of 1,100 yuan to purchase 11 aviation bonds worth 100 yuan each. In addition, on a small island in the West Indies, two overseas Chinese brothers who run a small business spent all their savings of 2,400 yuan to purchase one bond. Even ten-year-old children understood the great righteousness of patriotism and used their lucky money to buy bonds. Their noble spirit is a model for the world.

The Americas

Currently, the number of subscriptions reported in the Americas, in addition to 500,000 US dollars in Chicago, includes 1 million US dollars subscribed by overseas Chinese in San Francisco, 200,000 in Boston, 300,000 in Western Canada, 300,000 in Eastern Canada, 250,000 in Cuba, 100,000 in Honolulu, and other departments are also competing to be the first, with a total amount of more than 6.3 million US dollars, which has been successively remitted by various departments directly to the Jiu Yu Shan Guangdong Bank for the construction of the air force for the motherland government. This bond sale campaign is scheduled to end at the end of January next year, and all responsible persons will return home after the end.

The Philippines

In the Philippines, after Dai Jitao was sent to Nanyang, the overseas Chinese in various ports were also extremely enthusiastic, and the total amount of subscriptions has reached more than one million yuan. According to the total number of overseas Chinese in North and South America, which is only 300,000, such results have already been achieved. In Nanyang, there are millions of overseas Chinese, so the fundraising results will inevitably be better in the future. If each person subscribes for an average of two pounds, it will not be difficult to raise tens of millions.

### Three Banks and Six Money Shops to Open Next Spring

### Tongfu Road Opium Den Convicted; Defendants Refuse to Accept the Sentence and Appeal, Claiming They Were Deceived by Ding Guohua and Requesting Reversal; The Court Adjourned the Hearing and Awaits Judgment

A man named Ding Guohua previously opened a large-scale opium den on Tongfu Road in the Public Concession. Its business was no less than that of other opium dens. On October 14th of this year, Ding ordered his opium den employees Qian Yangyuan and Liu Mingsheng to carry 128 taels of opium and take a car from the opium den, with Cao Musheng, a local, as the driver, to send the large quantity of opium to an opium customer at a paint shop on Shandong Road. They were intercepted by the Public Concession police at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Shandong Road and arrested, along with 128 taels of opium, and sent to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court for prosecution according to law. The case has been tried by Judge Xiao Xiefen, who sentenced Qian Yangyuan and Liu Mingsheng to five years' imprisonment each for transporting opium together, and fined them 1,000 yuan each, and deprived them of their civil rights for five years. If the fine is commuted to labor, each 1,000 yuan will be converted into six months of labor. Cao Musheng was sentenced to two years and six months' imprisonment. Qian Yangyuan and others refused to accept the sentence. Qian Yan hired lawyer Wu Chuliang, and Liu Mingsheng and Cao Musheng jointly hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court, requesting a reversal. The High Court granted the request, and the Presiding Judge and the Prosecutor held a collegial panel hearing to re-examine the case. The appellant Qian Yangyuan stated that he was 31 years old and from Zhenjiang, and insisted that he did not know anything about the joint transportation of opium beforehand. According to the appellant Liu Mingsheng, Boss Ding gave him a package on the day of the incident and asked him to take it by car to the paint shop on Shandong Road, but he did not know that the package contained opium. According to the appellant Cao Musheng, he was a driver at Li's residence, and on the day of the incident, he was ordered by his master to drive Qian Yangyuan, Liu Mingsheng, and others to Shandong Road, and did not know that they were carrying a large quantity of opium. The court also questioned the detectives who handled the case and ordered the debate to begin. The police lawyer and the defense lawyers for each appellant debated for a long time. Each appellant unanimously requested a reversal. The court considered that the facts were clear, declared the hearing closed, and scheduled a date for judgment. Each appellant was returned to custody.

### Ye Zhongfang Sues Sun Lianfang for Debt

A man named Ye Zhongfang, nicknamed Xiao Douluan, recently hired lawyers Wang Heng and Gu to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the First Special Court, suing Sun Lianfang for owing 4,000 taels of silver. The case was heard in the Third Civil Court by Judge Ni. The defendant Sun Lianfang did not appear. According to the statement of lawyer Wang Heng and Gu, the agent of the plaintiff Ye Zhongfang, the defendant Sun Lianfang borrowed 4,000 taels of silver from the plaintiff's father in the 15th year of the Republic of China and signed a promissory note with a guarantor. The debt has been outstanding for more than ten years, and the principal and interest are about 6,000 yuan. He requested that the defendant and the guarantor be jointly ordered to pay off the debt. The court verified the statement and, because the defendant did not appear, ruled that the hearing be postponed.

### Taili Company Sues Tenant for Eviction

Recently, Zheng Shengji has returned the lease to Taili Company. Therefore, Taili Company filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the First Special Court, requesting that the defendant Jiang Yuting and others be ordered to move out and return the land. The case was heard in the First Civil Court by Judge Wang. The defendant Jiang Yuting and others objected to the eviction. The court ruled that the hearing be postponed pending investigation.

### Why Not Give It a Try?

— Jing Shusen

After reading Mr. Qiulang's "Deliberations on Two Porridges and One Meal," I feel that this method is good news for the salary class struggling on the isolated island. Because this method is easy to implement. It has no impact on nutrition; and it can save a lot of expenses. A win-win situation, why not do it?

It is not the author exaggerating to sensationalize, because the author's family has always implemented the "two porridges and one meal" system; and it has been implemented for many years, so it can be said to be "inherited from ancestors," right?

Of course, in peaceful times, it doesn't matter; but in years like these, it's a blessing! It not only saves rice and dishes, but also saves fuel and labor. Now I will write down the author's experience below:

Let's start with eating porridge for breakfast. The porridge mentioned here is not "rice congee," but "rice soaked in porridge." Therefore, the coal stove in the morning is usually not lit unless it is absolutely necessary. Just soak the leftover rice from the night before in some boiling water and simmer it on a kerosene stove for a few minutes to satisfy your hunger.

The midday meal is the most important of the three meals; the dishes to go with the rice will naturally be better. Chicken, fish, and meat are certainly rare; but green vegetables and tofu are our only gifts. However, the key to "saving" is not this, but to increase the amount of food that will be used for the evening meal and for making porridge the next morning when cooking the rice and dishes.

Speaking of making porridge for dinner, it is certainly the same as making it for breakfast; the difference is that instead of a kerosene stove, a coal briquette stove is used. Because you can use the remaining heat to boil some water and store it in a thermos for use the next morning.

Finally, I have to add a few words. The above is just a general description; how to use it depends entirely on the housewife's constant changes. At first glance, there seems to be little difference between "two porridges and one meal" and "one porridge and two meals"; but if you calculate carefully, you can save a lot of money on fuel alone for three hundred and sixty-five days a year! If you don't believe me, why not give it a try?

### Random Thoughts on Makeup

— Fei

Skin as smooth as cream, indeed, this fully expresses the tenderness and smoothness of the skin, as lovely as condensed fat. Needless to say, it describes your beauty as celestial, intoxicating the soul. It can be seen that tender and smooth skin is the basis of your beauty. From the standpoint of scientific beauty, this basis is very simple, that is, do not ignore the problem of daily skin care.

When you brush your hair, you can increase the effect by double. The method is as follows: sit on a low stool, stretch your legs straight, lean your head back, and then brush your hair with a hairbrush. This posture can make your scalp ruddy and healthy.

After applying face powder, Pan Lixi Lalan uses a cotton cloth dipped in cologne to remove excess powder from the forehead, and then wrings the cotton cloth very dry and pats it on various parts of the face, so that the face powder sticks firmly to the skin.

After you brush your eyebrows clean, use an eyebrow pencil of the appropriate color to lengthen your eyebrows, but do not draw them downwards, because if you draw them downwards, it will easily show a look of sorrow.

If you have a little extra perfume, you can put it on the outside of the telephone receiver to avoid odors. This is a very practical method.

When applying facial cream at night, you can use the same cream to apply to your hands, and then apply powder. This can make the color of the nail polish and the color of the skin very harmonious.

Shaving soap is not only for men, but women can also use it, because its material is very soft and oily. It can make the skin pores clean, and it is very comfortable to leave it on the skin for ten minutes.

### "Family Diary"

— Huai Mei

In a family, affairs are numerous and complicated. Unless all matters, large and small, are properly handled, it is impossible to see order and organization; however, a person's energy is limited. For certain major events, one can cope with ease, but only for trivial matters may one be able to attend to one thing and lose sight of another. A slight oversight will immediately reveal shortcomings, which is absolutely unbearable for those who are enthusiastic about family affairs, and which those who love their families cannot ignore. Therefore, wise heads of households and housewives often use notebooks to record all relevant matters for future reference and discussion. Moreover, some heads of households and housewives are negligent in simplifying family affairs and are therefore hasty and casual. Not only are they negligent in trivial matters, but they are also careless in major matters such as economic budgets and records of income and expenditure, eventually leading to a high platform being built and being trapped in sorrow without realizing it. The depth of suffering is truly beyond description. If they could pay attention to the allocation of income and expenditure, budgeting, and statistics beforehand, there would be no regrets afterwards. Drawing inferences from one instance, using this as a metaphor for that, it is not difficult to imagine how important it is to be prepared for a rainy day.

Up to now, among the practical and generous record books, the diary books sold on the market are the first to be recommended. This is because these diaries are all-encompassing and economical and convenient. All daily needs, including correspondence, income and expenditure records, meetings with relatives and friends, etc., are included in great detail; however, although there are many types, it seems that there is still a lack of a diary that is purely designed for families, which is inevitably regrettable. However, yesterday I obtained a type of family diary published by the Health Family Society on the market. In addition to the diary paper commonly seen in general diaries, name and address lists, letter receipt and publication tables, book purchase tables, income and expenditure summary tables, and communication registration tables, it also has economic budget tables, family birthday tables, ancestral name commemoration tables, sixty-year birthday calculation tables, newly revised etiquette, communication etiquette, writing style for gift seals, a collection of congratulatory inscriptions, standards of health, knowledge of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, first aid knowledge and other practical materials indispensable to families. It can be said that the content is rich and meets the needs. Those who care about family affairs should have one copy per person. This diary is finely bound in cloth, with additional illustrations and quotations from world celebrities attached to the diary paper. You can be friends with famous sayings every day, and it goes without saying that it is enough to cultivate integrity and thoughtfulness.

### Points to Note for Tuberculosis Patients in Winter

— Hong

In winter, due to the cold weather, we are most prone to bronchitis. Bronchitis is mainly characterized by coughing and phlegm. If tuberculosis patients also develop bronchitis, they will feel even more pain, so they should pay attention to avoiding it. The method is to wear more clothes, do not catch cold, and do not go to cold places from warm places wearing only the original clothes.

In tuberculosis patients with bronchitis and emphysema, the onset is more severe in winter, which is enough to affect their health. These patients must be careful in winter and should keep their homes warm and wear more clothes when going out.

The onset of tuberculosis often presents with symptoms such as fever, cough, and phlegm, which are easily confused with common colds and coughs. Therefore, if these symptoms occur and do not improve after more than three weeks, it is best to seek medical treatment for a proper diagnosis, and do not mistakenly believe that this is just a common winter cold and cough to mislead yourself.

In cold weather, we often make a fire in a confined space to keep warm. However, at this time, the flue of the stove may not be properly connected, or a stove with a small closure may be used, so that coal smoke accumulates in the room, which is enough to stimulate the patient to cough and choke, which is not appropriate. Therefore, it is best for tuberculosis patients to use hydronic heating instead of a stove.

Taking tonics in winter is a common habit. Tuberculosis patients can take cod liver oil and inject various vitamin preparations in winter, such as vitamin B and E, to increase the body's resistance. In addition, milk, eggs, etc. are also suitable.

### One Week's Economical Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Everyone knows that soybeans are very high in vitamins; therefore, soymilk made from soybeans is one of the most common tonics. Although the price of soybeans is much more expensive than before, a bowl of soymilk is still much cheaper than a pound of milk that costs more than one yuan. When it comes to cooking, soybeans can also be used in various ways. Vegetarians can have a bowl of stir-fried soybeans with sweet sauce, and those who like spicy food can add some chili oil. Adding golden needles, wood ear, and small fried tofu is also very tasty. For meat eaters, it is not only delicious, but also very nutritious. If you want to be more economical, then slice the meat into shreds and have a bowl of shredded pork and soybean soup, which is also not impossible.

### Chemical Small Talk

— Yan Hong

Winemaking is one of mankind's oldest and earliest chemical crafts.

The vapor of hydrofluoric acid can make the surface of glass rough (i.e., frosted glass).

Some say that taking arsenic (arsine) may allow one to carry heavy objects and climb high mountains without feeling difficult or painful, and at the same time be resistant to cold.

The by-product of gas production - coal tar - used to be a waste, but today it is considered a treasure because coal tar is needed as a raw material for the manufacture of dyes, drugs, seasonings, and cosmetics.

The narcotic drugs used by doctors, such as trichloroethane (sleeping medicine) and ether (yi tu), are really a great benefit to humanity.

Chlorine gas or chlorine water can bleach ordinary ink (such as ferrous tannate), but cannot bleach the ink used for printing (carbon).

Modern chemical advances have made it possible to treat all liquid oils by hydrogenation to make solid fats for the manufacture of soaps or for sale as artificial butter.

Mixing chalk powder and a small amount of sodium sulfide with water to make an award, and applying it to silverware that has lost its luster over the years, can immediately restore it to its original state.

The reasons for food spoilage are roughly the following six: water, light, air, metals, enzymes, and microorganisms.

When applying paint, do not apply it too thickly, because it cannot dry in a short time, which will inevitably prolong the time. Therefore, it is most suitable to apply it thinly several times.

Spring and Autumn

### Cotton Trade Front

— Ping Tang

...A portrayal of Shanghai...

Doo... Doo... Doo...

Another large cotton business has filled three trucks with cotton and is speeding away. The porters sitting on the top are holding long whips and looking around vigilantly, waiting to disperse the beggars who are robbing cotton.

The cotton picked by the villagers is placed in bags in front of the door to rest, and then gradually piled up. The clerk who is weighing is sweating brightly on his forehead, and is desperately raising his hoarse throat to shout.

He carefully carries the snow-white cotton, and in the past, the old and wrinkled black face is full of hope, and the weak and weak eyes are flashing with light. Alas! How annoying, the clear snot on the tip of the nose is hanging again; so he raises his sleeve to wipe it, and wipes it casually on his short jacket. "Cough! Cough!"

It's his turn. He respectfully presents it, trembling hands holding down the protruding cotton - don't drop a piece of precious cotton!

"Let go of your hand! Swine!" The weighing clerk yells.

"Um - yes! Yes!" His shrewd eyes are stingily staring at the stars on the scale. "It has to be knocked out a little bit, sir!"

"Medium to low... forty-six pounds." His cotton is put down and discarded aside.

"Sir! It's really more than this amount! Sir! Please weigh it again, it's more." His face suddenly turns mournful, and it looks even more strangely ugly, which makes people feel uncomfortable.

"Get out! This is not a place to make trouble." The weighing clerk roars. "Ah Lin! Come over and pull him away, it's up to him whether he sells it or not."

"Here I come!" Raised eyebrows, bulging eyes, fleshy face, Ah Lin in a "white-faced" outfit with black long shirt rolled up white sleeves responds and approaches.

"Go, go, go! Old friend! Be sensible!"

"But, sir! I weighed fifty pounds! The balance is not short of even an ounce. Sir! Can you weigh it again! Sir!..." He keeps saying tirelessly.

"It's obviously forty-six pounds. Weighing it a hundred times, a thousand times, it's still forty-six pounds. Go out and ask around, we never treat anyone unfairly here. We don't deceive the young, we don't cheat the old. Go inside and get the money, and no one will compensate you if you make a mistake later." The man called Ah Lin pushes him to the accounting office, but his withered mouth is still moving slightly.

"Are you forty-six pounds? Medium to low, forty-nine yuan, take it!" The accountant counts a stack of banknotes for him, but he doesn't take it, and puts it on the corner of the table.

"Oh! Sir! It's not even fifty yuan? Alas! To sell my cotton, when passing that "checkpoint", two were confiscated. They kicked me with their leather shoes. This is the third time, and I still "offered" a dollar. Alas! It's the blood and sweat of our whole year! Sir! Please make it up to an even fifty! Sir! I spent money on planting, ginning, passing the "checkpoint",... Sir! Have pity on me!" No one pays attention to him, it's just his monologue, and tears flow down the wrinkles uninhibitedly.

"Okay, go away, medium to low quality, forty-nine yuan, not even half a cent less, or you can take it back!" Ah Lin pushes him out of the door as soon as he finishes speaking.

"Alas, God!" He carries the carrying pole slowly and looks back at the crowd longingly.

### You Try Being Hungry!

— Zhi Zhi

This is a common living drama, and the location is in the market. Don't think that this is a small matter in the street. If you think about it deeply, you may be frightened, because this location may be changed to your home (?)

In Stealing Chicken Bridge, a guy is tiptoeing behind a plump woman. The woman is carrying two paper bags under her arm and a few paper boxes in her hands, and is hailing a rickshaw. Suddenly, the guy quickly runs forward, grabs the two paper bags under the woman's arm, and runs away as if flying. He has already torn open one of the paper bags and is chewing it. In a moment, he turns a corner and disappears. Although the woman is screaming loudly, people think this is a small matter (?) They just watch. Some people even laugh when they see the woman's extreme appearance.

I also followed and turned a corner. When I walked through a dirty alley, the guy was distributing the chicken cakes from the second paper bag to his young son, a daughter with a braid, and the baby in his wife's arms. My sudden appearance made him raise his head and look at me. I said with a wry smile: Don't be afraid of me, I don't..." "I'm not afraid of you!" The guy snatched the words. This answer stunned me. "You're not afraid even after robbing something?" I thought. "Aren't you afraid? What about the police?" He answered bluntly. "Police, I'm not afraid, I'm afraid of being hungry?" He said, bending down and gently kissing his baby. "Don't you understand? Then you try being hungry!" Because I was still staring at him blankly, he got annoyed! "Aren't you ashamed?" I asked unintentionally, but he smiled and shook his head at me. Of course, I'm too naive, "When clothing and food are sufficient, people know honor and disgrace."

Today, a mother's relative showed us the things that were left after being robbed, and everyone laughed. The child next door cried and told his mother: "Two big cakes have been robbed!" His mother also laughed.

Is this really laughable? Think about it, what if this location is changed to your home (?)

### Willow of Zhangtai

— Gu Mingdao

Mu Zhai said: "Madam, don't see capital. I will certainly die, but I wonder why the hurry. Firstly, although Jinling has fallen, the enemy troops have not yet killed to Yushan, and there is plenty of room in between. Secondly, there are many loyal and righteous men in Jiangnan. Who knows if someone will raise an army to serve the king and establish another King Lu, imitating Shao Kang's revival and the Southern Song Dynasty's half-country? Keep this body, and maybe it will be useful in the future. I must ask you to understand my painstaking efforts." Liu Rushi raised her moth eyebrows and said: "Pah! What painstaking efforts? You're just afraid of death. Why do I have to pretend like this? I know that you are old and your heart is shaken. How can you compare with Wen Wenshan and Shi Gabu? You are just a coward who steals his life and is afraid of death! Those who know etiquette and righteousness are like this, so what about the others? Hmph! You are really a bitch. What you said in the past is not enough to be believed. Since you are afraid of death, then why bother to coax people?" Liu Rushi had never been angry with Mu Zhai before. Today can be said to be at the height of her anger. Mu Zhai listened to her speaking eloquently, justly and forcefully, and it was impossible for him to deal with it with his evasive words, so he had to let her scold him and endure it patiently. At this time, Mu Zhai had the demeanor of letting people spit on his face and waiting for it to dry. Rushi continued: "I am not a cruel-hearted person either, forcing you to die together, just because I have something that I have to die for, so I don't want to live in vain. Living in humiliation and bearing grievances is not as good as dying with glory and integrity? That's why the ancients had a rumor that "I would rather die for Yuan Can than live as Chu Yuan". Today, if you die, you will be famous in history. If you steal your life in the world, then the things in the future will be unpredictable, I can't say it, and I can't bear to say it. I want you to die because I love you. You should understand the great meaning of Spring and Autumn, why are you so timid like an ordinary person today? How can you not disappoint me to the extreme?" When Rushi said this, she took a handkerchief to wipe her tears, and she really couldn't help crying at this time. Mu Zhai showed an embarrassed face, stood up, walked to Liu Rushi, and repeatedly bowed and said: "Rushi, Rushi, don't be sad. I am very ashamed, I have failed your good intentions. But I still want to be proper to repay the country, and if I fail, I will continue with death. You must understand me. Dying in vain is not because I am afraid of death." Liu Rushi said hatefully: "Obviously you are afraid of death, why do you still say that you are not afraid of death? If you can't die now, how can you die in the future? From now on, I will never believe your words. Alas! Liu Rushi has not failed you, but you have greatly failed me." Mu Zhai just bowed. And said: "Please slow down, I will never fail you, and I also thank you for your good intentions." Liu Rushi turned her head away. She didn't say a word, and didn't pay attention. Mu Zhai was very bored, and went to take off his court clothes and changed his wet shoes. So he didn't want to die. (25)

### The Future of "Zhe Shao Hospital"

— Huang Yuzhai

Since the Shaoxing Seven Counties Association initiated the establishment of "Zhe Shao Hospital," people from all walks of life have shown great concern. However, regarding the future of this undertaking, there are varying opinions. Some say that in the city's timber, coal, silk, liquor, and money industries, people from Shaoxing hold leading positions, so raising a small amount of money should not be difficult. Others say that while the strength of Shaoxing natives in the city's business circles is indeed strong, what can be done about their inherent stinginess? Some say that most Shaoxing people who are enthusiastic about charity are those without property, while the wealthy constantly maintain a wait-and-see attitude. In reality, in recent decades, Shaoxing natives in Shanghai are no longer what they once were. They deeply understand that closing oneself off makes it difficult to develop, while unity is sufficient for mutual assistance. They are also able to dedicate their efforts to the welfare of their hometown. The urgent fundraising of nearly two million yuan for disaster relief in Shaoxing this year is clear evidence of this. However, there are still those who cannot restrain themselves from speaking out, namely, the so-called bourgeoisie mentioned above, who ultimately fail to enthusiastically contribute. They believe that if they fall ill, money is omnipotent and that they need not worry about not being admitted to a well-equipped hospital. They believe that there will be famous Chinese and Western doctors to treat them, completely disregarding the fact that besides themselves, there are also relatives, servants, and poor neighbors and old friends. These people are struggling under the shackles of life, writhing in pain on their sickbeds. Do they still have the means to seek medical treatment? Therefore, the construction of "Zhe Shao Hospital" not only directly benefits the working class and the laboring masses but also indirectly benefits the middle and upper-class asset owners who hold positions as managers and bosses. How can they stand idly by and adhere to a "Monroe Doctrine" of indifference?

Let us consider this: since the establishment of our hometown association thirty years ago, due to the lack of hospital facilities, when hometown people fall ill, if they wish to be admitted to the "Si Ming Hospital," they must pretend to be Ningbo natives to be allowed entry. This kind of humiliation should be the full responsibility of wealthy hometown people. Therefore, before the "Zhe Shao Hospital" is completed, all Shaoxing natives, regardless of wealth or poverty, should do their utmost to solicit donations so that the magnificent building can be realized without difficulty.
