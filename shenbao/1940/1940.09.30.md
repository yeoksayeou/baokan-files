### British Publicly Warns Japan: No More Appeasement, Determined to Reopen Burma Road and Actively Aid China, While Speeding Up Talks with the U.S.

London – The British government last night publicly warned Japan, saying that Britain has been at war for over a year and, based on past experience, deeply understands that it should no longer adopt an appeasement (or绥靖) policy towards the Japanese. British officials here sharply responded to the broadcast speech of Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka. A spokesman for the British government said, "Japan may soon realize that the attitude of the British government today is very different from what it was a year ago." It is generally believed here that the spokesman's statement is a prelude to Britain's determination to reopen the Yunnan-Burma Road, preparing to transport munitions to the Chongqing government as soon as the Anglo-Japanese agreement expires on October 18. The reason for Britain's change in attitude is a reaction to Japan's connection with the Axis powers. According to this British expression, it is the beginning of a tough attitude towards Japan, and it is also Britain's preparation for full cooperation with the United States in the future to seek further retaliation against Japan, so as to take compensation for Japan's aggressive actions in Asia.

London – Although British newspapers pay close attention to the new German-Italian-Japanese pact, they show absolutely no sign of panic or worry. Generally, it seems that this pact does not change the overall situation much, but merely crystallizes a situation that previously existed in fact, even if not in name. As far as Britain is concerned, the situation of the European war will not be affected in any way. There are one or two things that can indeed excite people. One is the attitude of American newspapers. Although this pact is mainly aimed at the United States, American policy has not been threatened by it, nor has America shown any weakness. America obviously still wants to proceed with its established policy without change. One is that Tokyo is not as exaggerated about this pact as Germany and Italy. In addition, there is another important point, namely the attitude of the Soviet Union. The Daily Telegraph reports that the Soviet Union will definitely feel that this pact puts the Soviet Union in a cold storage room, and warns the Soviet Union that if it interferes in the European or Chinese war, it will be attacked by both the West. Although this pact is more direct to the United States, since Japan is mired in China, it cannot make a terrible threat to the United States. Therefore, the United States can still decide its position and ignore this. The newspaper's diplomatic correspondent said that, according to the information received, Moscow does not seem to be satisfied with this, probably because this new one is an expanded anti-British agreement. As far as Britain is concerned, London's efforts to mediate the Sino-Japanese war will therefore be suspended. The Times diplomatic correspondent said that British-American talks on the Chinese matter will be accelerated and reach an important degree corresponding to this new one. The Times diplomatic correspondent also said that the German-Italian-Japanese tripartite alliance stipulates in Article 3 that if one of the contracting parties is attacked by a country that has not yet participated in the war against Britain or the Sino-Japanese war, the contracting parties agree to provide military assistance to each other, the intention is to threaten the United States, or to shift its preparations from the Atlantic to the Pacific when it is not threatened at all. Japan may be able to help the Axis powers in this regard, but how the Axis powers can help Japan is not easy to see. German and Italian troops cannot go to the Far East. They themselves are in urgent need of naval assistance and the supply of raw materials and munitions. How can they supply Japan with military force and raw materials? The News Chronicle editorial said that this is obviously an attempt to threaten the United States, and it can now be asserted that it will not succeed. The triangle alliance of aggressor countries is still without the Soviet-German pact of last year, and it must have been established earlier. Japan is indeed suspicious and angry about this Soviet-German pact. Japan is encountering the continued struggle on the Chinese side, and feels the reduction in the supply of raw materials. Its situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. Is this why Japan now wants to formally conclude this alliance? In practical terms, the alliance of aggressor countries has only promoted the negotiations between Britain, Australia, and the United States on the issue of Pacific defense. (Reuters, 29th)

London – The Times commented on the German-Italian-Japanese pact, saying that these three countries are most afraid of American intervention. The Axis powers obviously want Japan to blockade Asia, which is unfavorable to the United States, so that American resources cannot be used as a backup for Britain. Before Japan proceeds with its aggression to threaten American power, it also wants to have support, even if it is just empty talk on paper, it is better than nothing. This can be seen from the anti-American tone of Japanese newspapers. (Reuters, 29th)

### Soviet Radio Report: Situation in Vietnam, Tensions in the Pacific, Now Progressing Daily

### The U.S. Responds to the Tripartite Military Alliance by Improving Relations with the Soviet Union; Wallace Asks for a Swift Response to Aggression

New York – The New York Times reported that the U.S. government will answer the new German-Italian-Japanese alliance by improving relations with the Soviet Union. According to a Washington dispatch, central figures have considered the political significance and economic possibilities in the current situation, and the ban on scrap iron exports may be expanded to apply to iron blocks and steel blocks, which will also be discussed, but no decision has been made yet. The New York Herald reported that the United States is now gradually making the Atlantic safe, and the threats encountered in the Pacific will also be dealt with in the same resolute manner. The United States needs bases and must reach an understanding with the South American republics and Australia and New Zealand. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch said that the German-Italian-Japanese pact prompted the United States to get closer to the vortex of world politics. The New Orleans News said that the German-Italian-Japanese pact does not change the truth of the situation in any way. If Nazi interests in the East are hindered in the future, Hitler may not respect Japan's superior position in the East. (Reuters, 29th)

New York – The New York World-Telegram carried yesterday that the United States is rapidly preparing to move towards war. The newspaper reviewed all the developments in the past forty-eight hours, including the US ban on scrap iron, the US loan of $15 million to China, the three-power military agreement between Germany, Italy and Japan, and the statement issued by British Ambassador Lothian, and so on.

### Welles Speaks Out, Condemns Germany, Italy, and Japan; U.S. Determined to Exert All Efforts to Aid Britain, Attaches Importance to Far East Interests

Cleveland – U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles said that the United States will do everything in its power to help Britain to fight for its survival, and at the same time condemned the aggression of Germany and Italy, and said that Japan disregards its obligations in law and morality, and only thinks of using force to fulfill its long-cherished wish to build a new order in East Asia. He continued to speak a warning, "This may be the most urgent period affecting the independence and survival of the United States." (United Press, 29th)

Cleveland – U.S. Secretary of State Welles stated here yesterday that Japan's desire to create its new order in Asia has clearly indicated its desire to independently determine the extent to which American historical interests and treaty rights in the Far East should be limited. Hundreds of incidents of destroying American interests have occurred, but there is no problem that cannot be resolved peacefully through negotiation, as long as the parties involved have the sincerity to seek an equal and fair solution, and give appropriate recognition to the rights and real needs of the parties involved. However, the United States must prepare for all unexpected events, arm itself quickly, and defend our new world to defend against the dangers that threaten us. The development of close relations between the American republics is one of the good phenomena in recent international relations. (Reuters, 29th)

Washington – Yesterday, the US government strongly criticized the recently signed German-Italian-Japanese public, and proclaimed a policy that it will "materially assist the land of fire, and assist the people of Britain at the beginning." Under Secretary of State Welles told the totalitarian countries at the diplomatic conference in Cleveland that the US’s unlimited assistance to Britain will be expanded to Australia and New Zealand in the future. Officials said that the expansion of US assistance to Britain may cause the US to conflict with Germany, Italy, and Japan at the same time. When talking about the US need for equal opportunities for trade in the Far East, Welles said that President Luo’s program to revive the military has made it sufficient to cope with "all incidents." Welles said when talking about the strategic importance of the tripartite public that the countries of the Western Hemisphere must form an impregnable front, and finally summarized the US Far East policy as follows: (1) The legitimate rights of American personnel must be fully respected; (2) Respect all international treaties and agreements to which the United States participates; (3) Equal opportunities for trade in all countries.

### Relationship between Japan and Australia Has Suffered Obstacles; Australian Naval Minister Hopes for British Decision on Imperial War Policy

Sydney – Observers here believe last night that Japan's signing of military and economic agreements with Axis countries has clearly set an obstacle on the road for Australia to try to improve friendly relations with Japan. The tripartite agreement is a manifestation that the general public here has long expected to happen, because these three totalitarian countries have always had a history of colluding with each other. Australian officials are convinced that this military agreement is directly attacking the United States, forcing it to decide on a basic policy for the Far East. (United Press, 29th)

Sydney – Australian Naval Minister Cameron commented on the German-Italian-Japanese public here yesterday, saying that this is very important because it opens up the entire relationship of international issues. This move by Japan has long been expected. If this war must be carried out along the borders of the British Empire, then the British Empire should have a war policy for the entire British Empire. (Reuters, 29th)

Bandung – Newspapers in the Dutch East Indies carried that the German-Italian-Japanese military agreement has no impact on the current world situation. Local newspapers wrote editorials, comparing the agreement to "a diplomatic thrilling performance," intended only for domestic consumption. Local newspapers unanimously supported continuing commercial negotiations with Japan, but must be based on the principles at the beginning of the negotiations. The newspapers also solemnly stated that the government must refuse to consider all Japanese proposals regarding the "New Order of Greater East Asia." (United Press, 29th)

Editorial

### The Conclusion of the Tripartite Alliance and the Far East

Regarding the signing of the German-Italian-Japanese tripartite alliance, this newspaper has already analyzed it yesterday. Now, please go on to clarify its impact on the Far East situation and Japan itself. Of course, the so-called tripartite alliance is just a virtual threat in the minds of the world, and it is also a last resort because they have failed to quickly fulfill their long-cherished wishes. However, the three countries themselves may not have great expectations for this, and believe that it is the future that they are entrusted with. It is true that Japan, which has been suffering from isolation for a long time, has unexpectedly gained two totalitarian powers as allies after hitting walls everywhere. It should always feel extremely complacent! And the recent Vietnam dispute, the Japanese side disregarded the warnings from Britain and the United States and brazenly took military action, undoubtedly relying on this about-to-be-concluded alliance relationship as a talisman. However, judging from the scene of the Japanese side in recent days, there is no sign of excitement. For example, the expression of the government authorities: Matsuoka compared it to using the national fortune as a lone bet, and Konoe called on the people to sacrifice and obey; in the promotion of their achievements, the color of uneasiness is deeply shaped. It can be seen that this move by the Japanese side cannot show any improvement in its international position at all, but is throwing itself into a new and greater adventure; the future of its fortunes and misfortunes is not expressed by the Japanese authorities who personally ordered this alliance. What kind of grasp does it have?

The so-called German-Italian-Japanese alliance is not a new problem, but just an outstanding case left over from more than a year ago. It is also a problem that the Hiranuma cabinet discussed and decided many times but failed to take concrete steps. Comparing the current international situation with that of more than a year ago: France has withdrawn from the international political stage, and Britain is also weaker than before, while Germany and Italy are much stronger than before. These are all factors that are beneficial to Japan's alliance with Germany and Italy. But Japan's own problem is in the Pacific. This is what Germany and Italy have always been absolutely powerless to do. On the other hand, surrounding Japan are China, which is resisting the war, the huge Soviet Union, the United States, which is increasingly concerned about the Far East, and Britain, whose strength is still not to be underestimated. These are all factors that are enough to determine Japan's future destiny. However, Japan only has contempt, anger, or hypocrisy towards them, and the relationship in any aspect is not a bit more advanced than a year ago. To form an alliance with countries far away, and to provoke the resentment of neighboring countries, the diplomatic achievements like this are not necessarily better than any of Konoe and Matsuoka's predecessors, but they are unwilling to pay such a high price.

According to the original text of the tripartite alliance, even if mutual understanding has been achieved in dividing the world, the wars of Germany and Italy in Europe and Japan's aggression in the Far East can only be carried out with their own strength until a third country is involved, and cannot immediately obtain mutual assistance. As far as Germany and Italy are concerned, since their international relations will not change due to the conclusion of this, they will not be affected in any way. But in Japan, the problem is not so simple: First, the policy of appeasement in the Far East will no longer have room for application, and the claim of condoning the crimes of aggression in the Far East for the past nine years will also have no possibility of existence. The opportunity for the aggressor to carry out vertical and horizontal operations is imperceptibly eliminated. Second, Japan's past economic and material dependence on Britain and the United States will be completely cut off. Recently, Japan's foreign trade and international balance of payments have fallen into a very unfavorable position, and this will inevitably become more and more miserable in the future. The southbound route is intended to open up economic resources, but it is not enough to replace the past British-American relationship, and it must also pay a heavy price. Opportunities such as Vietnam are not necessarily able to be encountered again. Third, the main purpose of the tripartite alliance is to contain the United States and scare away the United States. In fact, what is contained is extremely limited, and the intimidation is even more ineffective. The United States in the Far East will only become more active and severe due to this challenge. Fourth, with the international relations in the Far East becoming increasingly distinct, China's resistance to the war will naturally receive more assistance; claiming to solve the China problem with all its strength, it will have to disperse its attention and strength to deal with multifaceted oppression in the future. Fifth, although there are provisions in the tripartite alliance that the relationship with the Soviet Union will not be affected, this is only beneficial to Germany, because there is already a non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Germany; as for the relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan, the so-called adjustment of relations is still just empty words. In the past, there may have been the possibility of mutual approach. When Germany, Italy, and Japan have already unreservedly divided Europe and Asia, the Soviet Union will also feel that its territory spanning Europe and Asia will be subjected to new threats, and Japan's policy of defending the north and advancing to the south may not be able to do it without any scruples in the future. In short, no matter from any aspect, it cannot be seen that Japan's current predicament will be solved by this alliance relationship. On the other hand, it will only add countless new difficulties. The Japanese authorities are not completely unaware of this prospect. Because of this, Konoe and Matsuoka have been vigorously talking about the adventure of this move and the difficulties in the future. At the same time, it can also be seen that this road is not a smooth road in the minds of the Japanese authorities. However, since other routes have been blocked, the Japanese authorities who refuse to rein in at the edge of the cliff, the only future is to engage in the final adventure of a single bet. Under these circumstances, the entire situation in the Far East may not undergo any changes, and the only one affected is the Japanese side itself.

### German Official Says It Does Not Hinder Soviet Aid to China; Soviet Newspapers Pay Attention to International Politics and Economy, Keeping Absolute Silence on the Tripartite Alliance

Berlin – A German official said last night that the newly established German-Italian-Japanese military alliance does not prevent the Soviet Union from continuing to aid the Chinese government, provided that such aid is not "active." When reporters asked whether the Soviet Union's shipment of munitions to China conflicted with the alliance between Japan and the Axis powers, the German spokesman cited the United States' aid to Britain with 50 outdated destroyers as an arm. He said that such military assistance is not considered to be related to the provisions of the "defense" alliance. The spokesman said, "The point of decision" is how much influence the munitions aid can have on the war. As far as the transfer of 50 outdated destroyers is concerned, Britain can only use these old destroyers for transportation, so it cannot be considered helpful to the overall war situation. "German officials declined to state whether the Dutch East Indies should belong to the sphere of influence of Asia or Europe. It is said that "This matter was not mentioned in the tripartite public." When talking about Germany's attitude towards South America, the German spokesman said, "Germany has never opposed the Monroe Doctrine that America should belong to Americans. We very much hope to maintain friendly relations with all aspects of America." (United Press, 29th)

Berlin – Yesterday, when the press was entertained here, the spokesman said that the main goal of the tripartite public is to avoid the expansion of the war and to build world peace and guarantee the political and social stability of all countries. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

Moscow – Soviet newspapers yesterday kept absolute silence on the new three-power military alliance. However, each newspaper competed to publish the full text of the agreement signed by Germany, Italy, and Japan and the statement by the German Foreign Minister in a prominent position. At the same time, Soviet newspapers first decided to publish the German-Finnish agreement, which allowed German troops to pass through Finland to northern Norway. However, local newspapers also refused to comment on this news. "Truth" and other newspapers focused their editorials on issues of international economics and politics. (United Press, 29th)

Japan Tries Hard to Conclude a Treaty with the Soviet Union

The diplomatic community in London revealed that Tokyo authoritative sources said today that Japan is very eager to get close to the Soviet Union in order to conclude a Soviet-Japanese public similar to the Soviet-German public. According to the news obtained here, Japan is directly proposing to the Soviet Union, and at the same time asking Germany to mediate. Whether this matter will succeed depends on Moscow's attitude. This attitude cannot be determined yet. However, it is heard that the Soviet representative has consulted with the US government for some time. Therefore, it is believed that the Soviet Union may use it to negotiate with Japan. At the same time, foreign correspondents stationed in Tokyo telegraphed that the Japanese military newspaper said that if the United States gives China more aid, it will be considered a provocative act, and the tripartite alliance will immediately exert its effect.

Whitney said, "President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull did complete outstanding work at the Havana Conference, and cleared up the relationship between the republics of North and South America in one fell swoop, but they did not have time to go to the Pacific. I now vigorously say that the time to convene the Pacific meeting is now ripe, and I believe that if the United States convenes this meeting in Manila in the shortest possible time, all countries in the Pacific will be happy to accept the US invitation." Whitney said at the end, "The reason why I proposed to hold the meeting in Manila is that the American people have an obligation to guide the future of the Philippine people."

### Konoe and Matsuoka Broadcast Speeches, Threatening the United States Greatly

Tokyo – Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe and Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka today adopted a public speaking method to warn the United States and other ideal enemies, saying that the new public of Germany, Italy, and Japan is a tool of force, and will use this joint force to deal with those who interfere with the construction of a "new order" by totalitarian countries.

News from Washington said that Soviet Ambassador to the United States Umansky is holding talks with members of the US cabinet on establishing closer and more sincere relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. It is reported that Soviet Russia is now asking the United States to sell machinery and oil tankers worth 25,000,000 yuan to the Soviet Union, and to send US experts to the Soviet Union and give preferential treatment to Russians residing in the United States. Konoe said in the broadcast, "The current problem facing Japan will determine the fate of our nation, but we will still move forward courageously, knowing that we must go through hardships." Matsuoka's speech clarified that the treaty signed by Japan and the Axis countries is not intended to be just talk on paper, but to unite the military strength of the signatory countries and prepare to achieve each country's mutual goals.

### French Government Undecided on How to Handle Vietnam Incident, Will Ultimately Be Controlled by Pragmatism, Strictly Limiting Japanese Military Privileges, Thailand Shoots at Border Police District

Vichy: It is said here in political circles that French officials believe that concluding an agreement with Japan regarding Vietnam is entirely justified in completing the work of the Three-Power Military Pact. If the Vichy government continues its policy of assisting General Chiang Kai-shek and rejects Japan's ultimatum, Germany and Italy will immediately assist Japan in attacking France and England. With England making a "strategic withdrawal" in the Far East and the United States unwilling to help France protect the integrity of Vietnam, France today feels that the German-Italian-Japanese alliance is the only way to maintain the integrity of its Far Eastern empire. France, at a crossroads, must choose between the following two paths: continue to cooperate with American aid to China, but this policy will invite a Japanese attack on Vietnam. If the situation develops to this point, France, defeated by Germany in Europe, will certainly not be able to resist a Japanese attack. (2) Be willing to negotiate with Japan and recognize Japan as a major power wielding maritime hegemony in the Pacific. The Colonial Department favors the former policy, while the Foreign Ministry favors the latter. French business circles with huge investments in Vietnam and the Far East oppose the views of the French Foreign Ministry. The French government feels that if the first policy is adopted, England will not be able to help France disturb Vietnam after the attack on the Mers-el-Kébir in Oran, and Washington has not given any definite promises regarding material assistance to Vietnam. Rejecting Japan's ultimatum will inevitably lead to war, without a doubt. If such a war occurs within Vietnam, even if China sends troops to help France resist Japan, the French still feel that although China has a large population, it will still be of no avail, because China has neither a navy nor sufficient aircraft and heavy artillery to confront the Japanese. For this reason, the French will ultimately be controlled by pragmatism and sign an agreement with Japan, strictly limiting Japanese military privileges in Vietnam, allowing only the use of three airfields and not allowing the use of naval bases. Moreover, French political circles claim that France has decided not to allow the Japanese to use Vietnam as a base for attacking the United States, the Philippines, and other places, and that France's Far Eastern policy must be changed when necessary. If the United States and Japan go to war, France will remain neutral, and the French-Japanese agreement cannot bind France to provide the United States or Japan with any base for attacking the United States.

Hanoi: French officials in Annam yesterday shifted their attention to Thailand, because that country recently reiterated its territorial demands to Annam and used military aircraft to shoot at the Mengsha Dieya (transliteration) police district, forty miles into Annamese territory.

### United States Expands Naval, Land, and Air Force, Has Determination to Defend Territory, Roosevelt Personally Delivers Speech at Cornerstone Laying Ceremony of Washington Airport

Washington: At the cornerstone laying ceremony of the new Washington Airport yesterday, President Roosevelt spoke as hundreds of planes circled overhead, saying that the roaring sound of hundreds of American planes soaring in our sky is a symbol of our determination to create defenses on the sea, land, and air to resist any attack. They represent the authority that we must soon have. We may well refer to this as a kind of combat tool that democracy can have. We hope that it will always be tasked with maintaining peace. We will do our best to use our abilities and talents to ensure that it is not used for war missions. However, the more weapons we have, the less likely we are to use them, as the attacks we will receive from overseas will decrease accordingly. News newspapers and radio broadcasts have told us Americans how increasingly important airplanes are in aggressor countries and in countries striving for national survival. All this news explains the reason why the sky fleet is the prelude to today's ceremony. The American people now have 50,000 licensed aviators, and this number increases by nearly 2,000 each month. They are certainly not all military aircraft pilots, but they are prepared to become military aircraft pilots, just as farmers became frontline warriors during President Washington's administration. President Luo's speech was broadcast nationwide by radio. The construction cost of this airport is US$13 million, making it the largest airport in the world. The project is expected to be completed on December 17th. (Reuters Telegram, 29th)

### First Batch of U.S. Destroyers Arrive in England, Public Greatly Excited

British Naval Port: The first batch of outdated American destroyers recently transferred to England arrived here yesterday. The hulls of the ships were still painted in the gray color of American warships. Although the chimneys of the ships were mostly rusty and the hull structure was extremely unattractive, thousands of citizens standing on the shore were still extremely excited. They called it the "American Fleet of England." When the destroyers entered the naval port, white flags were hoisted high on the ships, and an "Awaiting" warning flag fluttered in the air on the shore, indicating that German aircraft were about to arrive. "Spitfire" fighter planes roared overhead to protect them. As the destroyers quickly entered the port, a young sentry on board involuntarily forgot his military posture. The rifle in his hand drooped to the ground at a ninety-degree angle and shouted, "Oh, I think these ships are not bad!" (United Press Telegram, 29th)

Special Feature

### Trotsky's Death

At five o'clock in the afternoon on August 20, 1940, Trotsky had just finished his tea and got up for a walk, passing through a door into a lush garden. He strolled back and forth, occasionally standing still, enjoying the refined taste of the middle class: a flower garden not essential for survival, but purely for enjoyment. The geraniums in the pots were sprouting, the roses were in full bloom; the chicks in the coop chirped, the rabbits in their enclosure frolicked, and among the branches above the twenty-foot wall, small birds chirped as the sun set. Thick shade covered the ground, branches intertwined, making the small courtyard appear particularly quiet. Above this city in Mexico, a clear sky held a few cotton-like white clouds in the distance.

Trotsky, in a relaxed mood, found a unique satisfaction in appreciating these scenes. Throughout his life, he had lived in the dark corners of rebellion and revolution. Now, with the passage of time, the arduous revolutionary cause had transformed into a simple, peaceful life. Old friends were few, disciples were far away, and only a handful of people visited from time to time. His writings were eloquent and of exceptional quality, worthy of a master of prose, far more admired than his revolutionary theories.

Trotsky, a sixty-year-old man, had written extensively, lived with his elderly wife, rented a house in the suburbs, planning to spend his remaining years in exile, and was financially comfortable enough to live a decent and orderly life. He had made it his mission to destroy the middle class, but now he had become a part of it. However, he himself did not quite believe it. He was always enveloped in an aura of revolution, like a smell emanating from a cellar, making people nauseous. Even his appearance was the same. He had a beard, like a wandering doctor, and messy hair on his forehead, clearly a political orator; his hands were thin, constantly moving; his nearsighted eyes were still bright; he walked with his shoulders hunched, his steps brisk and agile. At this moment, as he strolled in the garden, his demeanor was similar. Those plotting against him always felt that Trotsky harbored many latent dangers. He had experienced the dangers of a revolutionary, and from Turkestan to Mexico, he was always followed. His sons and younger relatives had died mysteriously during his years of exile. On May 20 of this year, thugs had sprayed his bedroom with machine guns, and he had narrowly escaped death. Mexico City was filled with male and female spies who were against him. Even so, he must have felt very safe in this small courtyard.

At half-past five this afternoon, a man named Frank Jackson came to visit. Trotsky thought he could not be a spy. Although Jackson had been suspected of using many aliases in Mexico City, in Trotsky's eyes, he was a promising young disciple who had also generously donated to the Fourth International. Six months earlier, a social worker from Manhattan named Sylvia Ageloff had introduced Jackson to Trotsky. Ageloff's sister had once been Trotsky's secretary. Jackson was tall, dark-skinned, and wore glasses. Originally from Yugoslavia, he had entered Mexico with a Canadian passport. He spoke English with a Brooklyn accent. The police bodyguards protecting Trotsky saw Jackson come and let him in without question.

Jackson had come to have Trotsky correct his manuscript. The amiable host led him into the house. As they entered, Jackson walked ahead, a coat draped over his arm. Trotsky's wife, Natalia Sedova, greeted the guest in the dining room, offering tea according to Russian custom. Jackson only asked for a glass of water, and did not take off the coat draped over his left arm. Trotsky and Jackson entered the study. Jackson still did not remove his coat.

The study was simply decorated, with no carpet on the floor. The walls were cream-colored, and besides a large map of Mexico, he had nothing else. In the center was a large wooden table, cluttered with books, papers, and manuscripts. Trotsky sat down to read the manuscript the guest had brought. Jackson leaned over his shoulder. Underneath his coat, he had already concealed a pistol, a dagger, and an ice axe. He had chosen this last "heavy" weapon. If a blow landed successfully, it could silently end the old man's life.

But Jackson was not nimble. Like Trotsky, he was used to living in the dark world of conspiracy, and his understanding of certain things was limited. If it had been a farmer or a worker, they would have known that to kill someone instantly, the first strike must be delivered with all one's strength. The ice axe was sharp, and a blow would have shattered Trotsky's skull, but unfortunately, not enough force was used. Trotsky did not fall, and did not even realize he had been struck. He only felt like he had been shot, and jumped up from his chair, grabbing the assailant and biting his hand tightly. The young Jackson, though armed with a knife, a pistol, and an ice axe, panicked and could not think of how to deal with the old man. Trotsky shouted loudly, shaking his body, and staggered into the dining room. The courageous Mrs. Trotsky blocked Jackson at the door, jumping on him and tripping him. Bodyguards Cober and Hansen also rushed to the scene. Cober knocked the assailant to the ground with a club, kicking him in the head and body. Hansen helped Trotsky lie flat on the floor. Blood poured from Trotsky's cracked skull. He said to Hansen, "Don't kill him. This man has something to say."

Even though Trotsky, the historian, was hanging by a thread, he still thought about how his dying moments should be passed down to posterity. Natalia shielded her husband with her body, and Trotsky pointed to his heart, saying, "I feel it here, they succeeded this time."

Trotsky's skull was fractured, spinal fluid leaked out, and the left side of his body began to go numb, but his mind was still clear. In the emergency room, he clearly dictated to Hansen: I was attacked by a political assassin in the room, and my life is hanging by a thread. I fought with the assailant. After he entered the room, he said he wanted to discuss French statistics. Then he struck me. Please tell our friends: I have no doubt about the victory of the Fourth International. Forward!

For twenty-five hours and thirty minutes after the attack, Trotsky struggled with his stubborn nature and life, as he had done since he began his revolutionary work at the age of seventeen, until the present moment. His head was operated on twice in the hospital, and the assailant was also being treated in the same hospital. His wife guarded him, never leaving his side. If a person on the verge of death can still recall past events, then the following impressions must have replayed on the membranes of Trotsky's unconscious mind: Bronstein (Trotsky's original name) at the age of nine, leaving the countryside of Kherson to study in Odessa... influenced by Marxism... imprisoned in Moscow in early 1898... marrying Alexandra Sokolovskaya... exiled to Siberia in 1900... escaping to England in 1902 under the pseudonym "Trotsky"... meeting Lenin in London... during which the First and Second Internationals were established in London and Paris... the failure of the Russian Revolution in 1905, exiled to Siberia again... escaping to Europe... returning to Russia after the March Revolution in 1917, meeting Lenin and helping with the October Revolution plan... the great achievements of reorganizing the Red Army... expelling the White Russians... establishing the Third and Fourth Internationals... exiled to Turkestan... France... Norway... Mexico... conspiracy... writing..."

Trotsky's death, except for his old comrades in Moscow, was generally considered terrible. Because most people had forgotten that he himself was a terrorist. The way Trotsky died is unknown to others, but some suspect that there might have been something offensive in his soon-to-be-completed "Stalin Biography." No one can guess what it was. Half of the original manuscript of this book has already been translated into English and is stored in New York; the other half, which has not been organized and translated, is stored in Mexico City. The publisher of the book does not know when it can be printed.

Looking at Trotsky as a writer, the writing of the "Stalin Biography" will not be of great importance in his literary reputation. His immortal work is the three-volume "History of the Russian Revolution." He was a social revolutionary, organizer, and leader. As a writer and practitioner, Trotsky will be unforgettable to the world.

When Lenin passed away, Trotsky suddenly blurted out thirteen words: "Lenin is dead. The news came like a huge stone sinking into the sea." When Trotsky was on the verge of death, no one wrote a word for him, which is a pity. (Translated from Time Magazine)

### German Aircraft Attack England in a Torrent, Guarded by Large Numbers of Fighter Planes; British Aircraft Engage, Anti-Aircraft Fire Dense as a Hailstorm; Failed to Invade Central London Last Night and This Morning

London - German aircraft launched another fierce attack on England yesterday. A large number of enemy bombers, guarded by an unusually large number of fighter planes, invaded southeastern England, attempting to break into London. In the afternoon, over a hundred enemy aircraft attempted to fly to the coasts of Kent and Sussex, but were intercepted head-on by British fighter planes. After many fierce battles, the enemy aircraft retreated, none reaching London.

Last night, the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security announced that German aircraft activity over England on Saturday and Sunday consisted of three waves. After dawn and near noon, enemy aircraft twice flew over the southeast coast, attempting to reach London, but were dispersed by British fighter planes. After dawn, a few enemy aircraft broke into eastern London, dropping a few bombs, but causing little damage. There were few casualties. During the engagement near noon, enemy aircraft did not reach London, only dropping a few bombs on a town on the southeast coast, causing some damage to houses, but no casualties were reported. In the afternoon, enemy aircraft approached the Portsmouth area but were also defeated by British aircraft, without dropping bombs. In these three air raids, the enemy used many fighter planes, so the air combat was mainly between fighter planes. According to current reports, six enemy aircraft have been shot down, while seven British aircraft are missing.

As of yesterday, the number of enemy aircraft lost in air combat over Britain in September reached one thousand and forty-six. In August, the enemy lost one thousand one hundred and fifteen aircraft. Counting two and a half crew members per aircraft, Germany has lost a total of two thousand one hundred and sixty-one aircraft and five thousand four hundred and two crew members since the beginning of August. After searching the North Sea for three days, British coastal aircraft and warships found the crew of a British bomber, who had been drifting in the sea in a rubber boat for eighty-four hours.

London - British anti-aircraft artillery unleashed its power this morning, causing German aircraft to only drop many heavy explosive bombs and incendiary bombs in the suburbs of London. Central London was as quiet as usual, and German aircraft were not as active as in previous night raids. (United Press, 29th)

London - This morning, German aircraft again raided England. Northwest and northeast England, Merseyside, and the East Midlands were bombed. Only a few enemy aircraft seemed to have broken through the defenses of central London. Most bombs fell in the suburbs. Enemy aircraft used various methods in an attempt to break through the anti-aircraft fire network, including some attempting to shut off their engines and glide, but ultimately could not escape the bombardment of anti-aircraft shells. Seeing no hope of breaking through, German aircraft dropped bombs in the suburbs and then retreated. (Reuters, 29th)

Berlin - German aircraft again flew to London yesterday, bombing military targets. Although British aircraft were on high alert and anti-aircraft artillery fired densely, German aircraft completed their mission and returned without any losses. The West India Docks were hit and caught fire, causing heavy losses. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

### British Long-Range Guns Roar All Night; Calais Becomes a Useless Port; French Coast Again Subjected to Fierce Air Raids; Explosions Shake the Coast Across the Channel

Vichy - According to news from various ports in northern France last night, British long-range guns and bombers have rendered the port of Calais useless. The docks and waterways have been destroyed, and ships have been sunk. Calais has suffered terrible losses. British long-range guns bombarded German gun emplacements at Calais and Cap Gris-Nez all night, firing every few minutes. German guns also returned fire towards Dover. British bombers hoped to destroy all German guns, but suffered heavy losses due to intense German anti-aircraft fire. (United Press, 29th)

London - According to the Air Ministry's intelligence office, on Friday night, British air forces flew to the French coast across the turbulent Strait of Dover with strong north winds, fiercely attacking German bases. The violent explosions shook the coast of Kent. Hundreds of heavy bombs were dropped on military targets, and flames shot straight into the sky. Enemy searchlights illuminated the sky, and anti-aircraft shells flew and roared. The port of Lorient on the French Atlantic coast was heavily bombed. Dockyard buildings were destroyed, and warehouses and material factories were hit and caught fire. The fire could be seen seventy miles away. The raid lasted three and a half hours. The night was clear and visibility was good, so British aircraft were able to accurately assess the damage caused by their bombs. In the first hour, bombs were dropped at a rate of five per minute. The fire spread rapidly. British aircraft used the light of the fire to drop bombs on ships moored in the river, causing explosions that lasted two minutes each. The Harvard dockyard was completely shaken, and steel and lead factories were also hit. Multiple oil pools were also hit. Another British squadron penetrated German territory, bombing railway yards in Mannheim and Hamm, and a large munitions factory in Dusseldorf. All British aircraft returned safely.

A Reuters air force correspondent said that the various ports and bases along the European coastline, which Germany considered extremely important, are now under the threat of the British air force. The attack on Lorient on Friday night was a step south in the British plan to attack ports along the coastline. Previously, the British air force's range of attack extended from Bergen in the north to Brest in the south, and its main efforts were concentrated between Hamburg and Le Havre. But British aircraft can now launch attacks along the entire European coastline from the southern end of France to the northern end of Norway, in retaliation for German air raids on England from various directions.

### The Ministry of Education Prevents Rising Book Prices; Issues Five Measures

(Chongqing Airmail) The Ministry of Education believes that the continuous rise in book prices hinders cultural development, and has issued five measures based on the proposals submitted by the Preparatory Office of the National Central Library, ordering the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities to instruct the book industry to comply. The measures are as follows:

(1) The quality of paper need not be exquisite, and the binding need not be beautiful. As long as the collation is accurate and the printing is clear, it will be a beautiful edition today. Native paper can be used, and all imported products such as art paper and newsprint should be avoided to reduce costs.

(2) Printing can imitate the methods of the Central Daily News, publishing in different locations. Only paper plates need to be sent for casting and printing, thus saving costs.

(3) Wages in Hong Kong are higher than in the mainland. If printing and distribution are done in the mainland, wages can be reduced.

(4) For printing projects that are heavy and cannot be published in Hong Kong and Shanghai, the Ministry of Education should ask the Ministry of Communications to instruct the railway bureau to provide convenience when transporting books.

(5) As for the current book prices, reference books are necessary for individuals and institutions, so the price increase is particularly large, which is unbearable for ordinary readers. The existing printed books and those that were transported to the mainland before the war should not be priced at the same level as newly printed and newly transported books.

### Recent News on the Collection of Winter Clothing Donation in the City's Educational Circles; Strictly Following Regulations; Remittance Method Unchanged

(Dahua News Agency) Previously, the educational sector of this city, in order to expand the promotion of the winter clothing donation campaign, formulated measures and ordered all schools to implement them. Educational groups throughout the city also responded actively, urging their affiliates to promote them consistently, with enthusiastic situations and remarkable results. Details have been reported in various newspapers. According to the original regulations, after the winter clothing donation was collected, each school should directly remit it to the Chongqing Winter Clothing Donation Headquarters or entrust the newspaper or bank in Shanghai that collects donations on its behalf to forward it. Each school also consistently followed this. However, recently, each school suddenly received a mimeographed notice bearing the name "Yu Zheng," stating that in the future, the donations collected by each school should be handed over to the "Shanghai Refugee Relief Society" or the "Shanghai Refugee Relief Association" in this city, and there is no need to send it to the bank, etc. The educational sector of this city has denied issuing this notice, and each school still follows the original regulations, stepping up the fundraising work? Consistently remitting it directly to the Chongqing Headquarters or the collecting newspaper or bank.

Furthermore, Dahua News Agency reported that Yuan Jianming, a student in the first grade of the junior high school department of a certain private middle school in this city, was deeply indignant because the school was promoting the winter clothing donation campaign, and each student paid half a yuan according to the prescribed standard, and they were all obtained from their families, so he could not donate as much as possible with his own savings. Therefore, he emptied his pockets of his savings from previous years, totaling fifty yuan, and donated them all, in order to encourage teachers and students of the school to respond, and the amount of fundraising suddenly increased.

### School News

Jian Guang Volunteer School: The Jian Guang Scholarship Fund Management Committee, in order to relieve out-of-school children and assist the nation in eliminating illiteracy, specially established seven Jian Guang Volunteer Primary Schools. Since their establishment last autumn, they have been actively expanding. This semester, one more school has been added, distributed in various concession areas. After the summer vacation volunteer class ends this autumn, preparations for all school opening matters for this semester will be made. Currently, all volunteer schools are uniformly opening in early September. Due to the sharp increase in social commodity prices, volunteer school students are even more enthusiastic. It is heard that the teachers and administrators of each school are strongly advocating strictness, which has gained the trust of students' parents. Therefore, after the start of school, there are still students requesting to enroll one after another, but due to the quota being full, it is impossible to accommodate them. It is heard that the person in charge of the committee is trying to find ways to add new schools to provide relief.

Shanghai Small School: Shanghai Small School held a Mandarin speech contest the day before yesterday.

### Reducing Deposit Interest Rates and Future Speculation

— Zhang Liu

A few days ago, I saw news in the newspaper that Zhejiang Industrial Bank reduced deposit interest rates. The reduction method is to reduce the interest rate by one-tenth of a percent for current deposits on October 1. Then I saw reports that Yanye, JinCheng, Zhongnan, Mainland and the Four Banks Savings Association, for current and current account deposits, whether in the Commercial Department, Savings Department or Trust Department, all reduced by one-tenth of a percent. We do not know whether these banks have increased deposit rates in the past; however, one thing we can know is that recently, the banking industry has felt that the use of funds is becoming increasingly difficult, and they have to reduce their burden by reducing interest rates. This really illustrates the recent trend of Shanghai's industrial, commercial and financial sectors, which is worth paying attention to.

Regarding the question of whether interest should be given on current deposits, the general opinion of banking scholars is that, according to the customs of various countries, interest should not be given, because the procedures are more complicated and the deposits are not sought for long-term use. However, in our country, current deposits have always had interest, but the interest rate is generally lower than that of fixed deposits. The reason for this may be that the deposit interest rates in our country are generally higher than those in other countries, so current deposits cannot but pay interest.

The level of deposit interest rates is usually determined by each bank at its own discretion. Generally, those who need deposits more urgently cannot but increase the interest rate relatively. Those who do not need deposits may reduce the interest rate relatively. However, on the other hand, the level of deposit interest rates can actually reflect the situation of the country obtaining production funds. The deposit interest rate is higher, and the lending interest rate must also increase accordingly, that is, the production sector must bear a larger interest rate to obtain funds. Conversely, the deposit interest rate is low, the production sector can obtain funds more easily, and the burden of interest is also lighter, and the business is naturally easy to develop. Our country's production is backward, and the rural areas have not yet emerged from feudal society, so there is still a high-interest loan situation. As for cities and urban areas, it is easier to obtain funds due to the development of the banking industry, so the interest rate is lower than that in the inland areas. Shanghai's deposit interest rate can be said to be a relatively low area in the country, but compared with the local foreign banks, it is still higher. The burden of obtaining funds for Chinese businesses is still heavier than that of foreign merchants. Therefore, reducing deposit interest rates is very beneficial to the development of production.

Because the level of interest rates has the effect of regulating production funds, the interest rate policy is also one of the main topics in the national financial policy. Generally speaking, in times of financial tension, high interest rates can be used to retain the outflow of funds, while in times of financial relaxation, low interest rates can be used to make the turnover of industrial funds more active. In addition, it also has a considerable effect on the adjustment of production prices in theory, because the interest rate is a direct burden on production unemployment and also one of the commodity cost burdens, so the level of the interest rate can directly affect prices.

What is the motive behind this reduction of deposit interest rates by various banks in Shanghai? What kind of reaction will the reduction have on today's Shanghai? Here is a simple exploration.

### The Strange Phenomenon of Speculation with Borrowed Money

"The increase in floating capital" has become a common catchphrase for Shanghai people, but the increase in floating capital really illustrates the wartime situation of Shanghai's financial market. Why does Shanghai feel that there is too much floating capital? If there is really too much floating capital, then why have our exchange rates risen sharply in the past six months? It can be seen that there is too much floating capital, this is a fact, and the production sector does not obtain easier funds because of the excess of floating capital, this is also a fact.

After the August 13th incident, Shanghai did not feel the excess of floating capital. Due to the decline of general industry and commerce, the banking industry was unable to use the accumulated funds. The following March, after the black market for foreign exchange occurred, the escape of funds became increasingly open, and the number of escapes also increased day by day. Funds from the inland areas flowed to Shanghai due to trade surpluses, and the escape of funds was also greatly increased due to the development of speculative businesses in Shanghai. Therefore, the flow of funds throughout the country is almost centered on Shanghai, while the funds in Shanghai are concentrated on the escape of funds. The most obvious is foreign exchange arbitrage. The so-called foreign exchange arbitrage is a kind of activity that directly buys foreign exchange with funds first, which is of no benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The people who buy foreign exchange with borrowed funds are eager to obtain compensation for debts and are willing to bear higher interest rates. This interest is the source of foreign exchange arbitrage, and the amount often reaches 40% per month, which is a weekly interest of 4.8%. Regular bankers do not engage in businesses such as arbitrage, but the newly established silver houses and enterprise companies are collectively investing in arbitrage, which is already very open. Funds are somewhat like flowing water. Water flows to the low places, and funds naturally flow to the profitable places. With such a good place to go, the interest rate of depositors has invisibly increased, and everyone is willing to borrow money to speculate, which is one of the reasons for the high interest rates in Shanghai after the war.

What about the industrial and commercial circles? They are also willing to bear higher interest rates to engage in the expansion of production. Following the fluctuations in the foreign exchange black market, prices also rose accordingly. Every factory, as long as it stores more raw materials, its profits often exceed its entire year's sales of finished goods. The production sector has gained huge profits due to the rise in prices. On the one hand, they purchase and store a large amount of raw materials, and on the other hand, they greatly expand manufacturing, because their profits are high, so they are also willing to bear higher interest rates. This is also one of the reasons for the high interest rates in Shanghai after the war.

Because of the increased escape of funds, the advancement of speculation, and various reactions, every industrial and commercial operator needs funds, every speculator also needs funds, and at the same time, regular financial operators also need funds to prevent the outflow of funds and the expansion of business. We see the surge of silver houses and money exchange shops, they are the organizations that absorb funds. In this state, the general interest rate of funds will naturally rise.

Far-sighted scholars see this phenomenon and believe that it is the work of floating capital, so they put forward the slogan "Go to the Southwest", but it has not been successful so far. The reason for this is naturally many. One is that the production equipment in the inland areas has not been able to adjust and cooperate with the funds, and the other is that the interest income in Shanghai is far above the general investment.

### Entering Old Tombs or Finding a Living

Now the Shanghai banking industry has proposed the fact of reducing deposit interest rates. According to the past unreasonable high-interest loan situation, reducing deposits is naturally a gratifying phenomenon. But after the interest rate is reduced, does it mean that the future floating capital will tend to the regular path; and the regular industrial and commercial operators can therefore obtain low-interest capital turnover?

No, rather than inferring the consequences from the reduction of deposit interest rates, it is more appropriate to explore its driving force. The first thing we want to point out is that today's reduction of deposit interest rates in Shanghai does not at all mean that the trend of the financial circle is rationalized, but simply means that this is the decline of Shanghai's "prosperity". These floating capitals, which used to be powerful in the speculative market, are now idle.

The biggest reason is the long-term stability of the foreign exchange black market. After mid-June of this year, the foreign exchange black market recovered from a tense state, and the return of huge amounts of funds made it impossible for people who bought foreign exchange to obtain any benefits. The exchange rate against the US dollar has risen from more than four yuan per hundred yuan to more than six yuan. Many speculators have failed in this decisive storm. The so-called arbitrage activities have also become unprofitable due to the decline in speculation. Since the largest destination of funds has been blocked, the funds that escaped in the past have returned to the hands of banks and money houses, and the deposits in banks and money houses can only accumulate.

Due to the easing of the exchange market, it has also affected the commodity market. Major commodities such as cotton yarn have almost fallen in price by 50%. The decline in commodity prices has certainly affected the production of factories, and the blockade of the Southwest, Myanmar, and Vietnam roads has gradually reduced the scope of industrial and commercial activities. The need for funds is also significantly different from the past situation of the more the better.

These two situations are precisely the evolution of the entire Shanghai market. According to the general theory of prosperity, in the rising period of prosperity, industry is active, interest rates are high, and prices are high. The opposite is true in the declining period. The prosperity caused by the devaluation of currency is similar. Although the foreign exchange indication of legal currency does not at all mean the devaluation of currency, the special prosperity caused by the devaluation of the foreign exchange black market is similar to the prosperity that occurs during the devaluation. And all the phenomena felt today are similar to the consequences of currency contraction, and reducing deposit interest rates is one of the indicators of this.

This kind of reduction in deposit interest rates can affect the reduction in lending interest rates, but this reduction will not make the industrial and commercial circles feel any substantial benefits, because the entire operating mechanism of the industrial and commercial circles is also in a state of stagnation. It is even less likely to happen in Shanghai.

But this does not illustrate the pessimism of the entire financial market prospects, thinking that funds really cannot find a home. We believe that Shanghai is in a special situation today, and bankers should be aware of the past methods of using funds. Ten years ago, we criticized the investment goals of Chinese banks as foreign exchange, public bonds and real estate. Five years ago, the items of real estate and foreign exchange gradually disappeared, but today, ten years later, the investment goals of the banking industry have unconsciously returned to the old tombs! The foundation of the prosperity of the banking industry naturally relies on the production business. After grasping this point and reducing deposit interest rates, how should we invest? Perhaps everyone knows this.

### Overview of Japan's Resources

— Yan Maode

As everyone knows, Japan is a country with innate deficiencies and extremely scarce resources. However, modern warfare is a war of massive material consumption. Without abundant resources, the war cannot be continued.

Now, thirty-seven months after the Sino-Japanese War, what is Japan's resource situation? This is undoubtedly extremely important for estimating the future of the war. Moreover, recently the United States has implemented an embargo on oil and iron to Japan, which has had a major impact on Japan. Therefore, we need to review Japan's resource situation.

For the sake of convenience, we will divide Japan's resources into five aspects: metal resources, power resources, food resources, chemical resources, and textile resources:

Metal resources: It can be said that the metal resources owned by Japan are extremely scarce, especially the very important resource - pig iron, which Japan is particularly lacking. According to a survey by the Geological Society of Japan, the reserves of iron ore in Japan are 101.95 million tons, with an iron content of 40.32 million tons. The reserves in Korea are about 100 million tons. According to estimates by the International Geological Society, the reserves of iron ore in Japan are only 56 million tons, of which the iron content is only 18 million tons.

The difference between the above two estimates is obviously due to the inclusion of water. But even if we admit that the former is reliable, it is still not enough to supply domestic consumption. Because in 1936, Japan's iron consumption was 4 million tons, of which 1 million tons were mined in Japan and Korea, and the remaining 3 million tons were completely dependent on imports from China, the Malay Peninsula, the Philippines, and Australia. In September last year, Japan announced a ban on the sale of steel to private individuals, showing the seriousness of its wartime steel production problem. Now the United States has implemented an embargo on scrap iron to Japan, which is bound to increase the degree of panic about Japanese steel, which will become an extremely serious problem in the future of the war.

As for other light metals, Japan also feels a great lack. Although the reserves of copper (about 150 million tons) and production are quite high, it still needs to import a lot. 52% of the annual amount is imported from the United States. Aluminum and tin, which are needed in industry, are also purchased from abroad by 90% and 70% respectively each year. The self-sufficiency of aluminum is only one-tenth, that of zinc is two-tenths, and that of nickel is almost completely non-self-sufficient; in addition, Japan is certainly very lacking in alloy materials such as manganese, antimony, tungsten, zinc, cobalt, cadmium, and chromium, which are necessary for military needs.

Power resources: Japan's coal reserves are certainly not as good as those of the United States, the Soviet Union, Germany, the United Kingdom, and China, but they are still barely satisfactory. According to surveys, the coal reserves in Japan are about 628 million tons, and those in Korea, South Sakhalin, Taiwan, etc. are 199.5 million tons, totaling more than 827 million tons. The recent production volume has been as high as tens of millions of tons, of which 90% can be self-sufficient. However, we must pay attention to the fact that most of Japan's coal production is bituminous coal with too much volatile component, so it cannot obtain good char coal (the so-called coking coal). Therefore, the coking coal used for manufacturing metallurgy and the iron-making industry is almost completely lacking. As a famous Japanese professor, Inu Kami's survey shows that only 15% of Japan's coal is available for industrial use, and the coking coal used for the metal industry that manufactures military supplies is mostly dependent on foreign imports.

Of the power resources, the more important is oil. Japan's oil consumption is about 40 million tons per year, but the actual self-sufficiency capacity is only 4 million tons, that is, the insufficient quantity reaches 90%, all of which depends on imports from the United States, etc. However, after the United States implemented an embargo on oil to Japan, it is bound to become the biggest problem in Japan's resources. It is not known to what extent the current reserves have reached, but no matter what, they cannot last for a long time if the war is prolonged. What's more, the amount of money that Japan flows out overseas to purchase oil reaches 172 million yuan. If Japan's oil runs out, not only will its domestic cars not be able to start, but even its invasion tools - airplanes and tanks, etc., can only be displayed publicly as exhibits on the battlefield.

Food resources: The main foods of the Japanese people are rice (accounting for 60%), wheat, soybeans, fish, meat, sweet potatoes, and other miscellaneous grains. It can be seen that rice is Japan's basic food. In the past ten years, the domestic rice production in Japan has been about 65 million stones per year, and the consumption needs about 75 million stones per year, with an annual shortage of about 10 million stones; the insufficient amount is imported from Korea and Taiwan. However, this year (1939-1940) Korea also feels the same rice shortage, and it will not be able to supply Japan any longer, thus causing a great panic in Japan's food supply. As for wheat, Japan needs 3 million tons per year, and its self-sufficiency capacity is 40%, and most of the insufficient amount depends on Australia and Canada. We know that Japan is an agricultural country, and 48% of its people belong to the farming class. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, many farmers have been conscripted, resulting in today's shortage of labor and high wages in Japan, and the output of fertilizers has also been greatly reduced, so farming must be greatly affected, and the food panic will be further strengthened. However, self-sufficiency in staple food is the greatest resource for a country's economy, otherwise it will be heavily dependent on foreign supply. What's more, the total value of Japan's annual food imports has reached about 100 to 200 million yuan. If this continues, it will inevitably have a serious impact on the economy, which will in turn cause great social unrest.

Chemical resources: Chemical resources are not only important in general industrial uses, but also indispensable for the manufacture of explosives and toxic gases. Although Japan has a large amount of sulfur, it cannot supply the wartime needs for chemical products such as industrial salt, resin, alcohol, phosphate rock, soda, and fertilizer. Taking industrial salt as an example, Japan needs about 1 million tons of industrial salt per year, and about 80% of it must rely on imports, most of which comes from Italian Somaliland, followed by Egypt and Kwantung. In addition, soda and alcohol are extremely scarce, and 150,000 tons need to be imported each year, so the value of the materials imported each year reaches more than 15 million yuan.

Fiber resources: Fiber resources are also closely related to military needs both directly and indirectly, but Japan feels a lack of major fiber resources such as cotton, wool, wood pulp, and linen, and even 90% or more of them must rely on imports. Japan has almost no domestic production of cotton, and it all depends on imports from the United States, India, China, Egypt, and other places. Wool is imported from Australia, New Zealand, and other places. Wood pulp is imported from the United States, Norway, Finland, and other places. (The annual consumption of wood pulp reaches 882,000 tons, and only 60,000 tons are produced in Japan and Manchuria, and most of this raw material is supplied to papermaking.) When fiber resources cause panic, it will not only destroy the foundation of Japan's light industry, but also have a great impact on the manufacture of military industries.

In addition, the annual demand for rubber is more than 50 million yuan, of which 47% is imported from the Straits Settlements, and 23% is imported from the Dutch East Indies. The raw materials for the leather industry are extremely lacking in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Sakhalin, and the annual demand is about 30 million catties, of which 20 million catties must rely on imports, supplied by China, Manchuria, the United States, and South American countries.

In short, Japan's most difficult resources are cotton, wool in the textile industry, and oil and iron ore in the military industry. These resources are the lifeblood of Japan's national economy. A reduction or interruption in the source will inevitably make Japan unable to continue the war. Recently, the United States has implemented an embargo on oil and iron to Japan, which has had a greater impact on Japan's war industry. Therefore, under the conditions of Japan's continuing war and consumption, Japan's collapse or demise is an economic inevitability, which can be asserted.

### Financial Commentary

— Saint Kai Qiong

— September 28th —

If the United States seeks to stabilize the exchange rate of the Chinese currency, in order to develop trade between China and the United States, then Song's 25 million US dollars will inevitably be allocated to the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund account. The United States must participate in the operation of the fund to control the activities of black market speculators and stabilize the exchange rate of the Chinese currency. Whether this will lead to cooperation between China and the United States in stabilizing the Chinese currency is difficult to predict. However, if the United States truly hopes that China will resist Japan in order to contain its actions in the South Pacific, then financial cooperation, we cannot say, is just an illusion arising from the need to supply 25 million US dollars in foreign exchange.

In fact, in any case, the establishment of the new Sino-US loan is a major blow to foreign exchange speculators. Whether it is used to stabilize the black market of the Chinese currency or to give speculators a head start, it is used for the economic construction of the anti-Japanese war in Free China. Because the stronger China's wartime economic power is, the more solid the foundation of the Chinese currency is, and the stronger the value of the Chinese currency is, then foreign exchange speculators who hope that the value of the Chinese currency will develop unfavorably will inevitably be frustrated. This is self-evident.

It is said that among the banks in Shanghai, two large commercial banks, due to the difficulty of operation and the reason for preparing their own funds, are unwilling to bear the interest on deposits and will reduce the interest rate on current deposits, which will be implemented from October 1st. I remember that before the war, the Chinese government hoped that the banking industry would reduce interest rates to revitalize industry and commerce, but the banking industry hoped that the government would lead the implementation on the front, but on the back, it solemnly said that the banking industry had high deposit interest rates due to cost reasons, and loan interest rates had to be high. If loan interest rates were to be reduced, deposit interest rates had to be reduced first. This secretly indicated to the government that if the government had a way to reduce deposit interest rates, bank loan interest rates would naturally be reduced. China is a country of high interest rates, so reducing interest rates is just talk. Unexpectedly, after the three-year war between China and Japan, two large commercial banks in Shanghai automatically reduced deposit interest rates without the leadership of the government!

At this time and place, what impact will the banking industry's reduction of deposit interest rates have on the anti-Japanese war economy? Let us leave it aside for discussion. However, in the author's intuition, the Shanghai banking industry, instead of only having passive measures and calculating the interests and losses of one industry, why not recognize the times and actively plan some contributions that are beneficial to the country? We must know that passive measures have more destructive components, while active facilities have more constructive components. The author uses "interest rate reduction and internal transfer of funds" to criticize the Shanghai banking industry.

Among the Shanghai banking industry, the enlightened bankers have not made contributions to the country's wartime finance during the war, such as supplementary measures to stabilize finance, such as strengthening the use of the remittance system, etc. After three years of anti-Japanese resistance, bankers should strive to work hard for the country and quickly seek the internal transfer of funds immediately after the interest rate reduction. The original way to use Shanghai current deposits was for the banking industry to use them in the speculative market, or for depositors to speculate directly. Originally, they did not pay attention to the annual interest rate of 3% or 3%, but prayed for speculative profits to be multiples, tenths, or the minimum percentage. Now that the bank suddenly reduces 1%, it makes speculators think that deposit interest is better than speculative interest, and those who do not speculate in current deposits also have the idea of engaging in speculation to make a living. Therefore, if there is no way to absorb these funds and make them move inward and invest in economic construction related to the anti-Japanese war, it will inevitably expand the trend of speculation and obliterate the concept of investment.

Free China is working hard on the thrift and national construction savings movement. The Hong Kong branch of a certain commercial bank that decided to follow up with the interest rate reduction is also selling savings bonds. Although it cannot be sold in Shanghai due to environmental reasons, the author believes that it is possible to change the method and create various investment savings in various names, such as investment in light industry savings, investment in heavy industry savings, etc. After the bank receives this fund, it will immediately remit it to the mainland to purchase national construction savings bonds, or organize various investment groups to seek the internal transfer of funds. However, the former method is better than the latter method, because the national savings bonds are repaid by the state with principal and interest, which is beneficial and harmless; while when organizing investment groups, there are benefits and losses, and it cannot be guaranteed to be beneficial.

I hope that the enlightened bankers in Shanghai will formulate a method and work hard to implement it, so that after the interest rate reduction, it will be followed by the work of absorbing funds. (End)

### Public Concession Traffic Fully Restored Yesterday Morning; French Concession Labor Strike to Begin Negotiations Soon; Yu Qiaqing Hopes for Sincere Cooperation between Labor and Management

Workers of Shanghai Electric Tramway Co., Ltd. of the Public Concession, China General Omnibus Co., Ltd., and French Electric Tramway Co., Ltd. of the French Concession, successively went on strike to demand improved treatment and conditions. After mediation by Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng, Chinese directors of the Engineering Bureau, and Gu Bingyuan, director of the conciliation of the Industrial Section, the British Electric Tramway Co., Ltd. and China General Omnibus Co., Ltd. have signed a complete and satisfactory settlement. All trams, trolley buses, and buses on all routes have been fully restored to operation yesterday morning. The striking workers of the two companies have resumed work under the protection of detectives. The treatment conditions proposed by the workers of the French Electric Tramway Co., Ltd. will soon be directly negotiated. Trams on routes 2, 7, and 10 are still barely maintained under the protection of armed police.

Traffic on All Routes Restored to Original State

After the strike of workers of the British Electric Tramway Co., Ltd. and China General Omnibus Co., Ltd. was resolved by Yu Qiaqing and others, the labor union urgently notified the workers to resume work. The company arranged schedules and dispatched vehicles. Starting at 4:00 a.m. yesterday, the early shift workers reported to various places as usual to resume work. In order to protect the workers from resuming work, the public concession police stations specially dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to various places to be on guard. The order of the workers of the two companies to resume work was very good, and no incidents occurred. All trams, trolley buses, and buses on all routes have been fully restored to operation, and the traffic in the Public Concession has been completely restored to its original state. However, the British Electric Tramway Co., Ltd. decided to temporarily stop driving into the French Concession until the labor strike of the French Electric Tramway Co., Ltd. is satisfactorily resolved, such as trolley buses on routes 17 and 18 to Da World, trolley buses on route 24 to Seymour Road and Foch Road, and trams on route 5 to Dongxin Bridge.

Public Bus Agreement Original Text

Conditions signed by labor and management after the strike of workers of the British China General Omnibus Co., Ltd. was resolved through mediation: (1) The company agrees that, starting from September 1, 1940, all Chinese employees will be entitled to a special living allowance of 35 cents per person per day, except during the period of worker absence or dismissal. During sick leave, half of this allowance will be given. (2) If all workers resume work uniformly on Sunday morning, September 29, 1940, one day's wages will be given separately during the strike period. (3) The payment of the pension regulations once contained the stipulation that if a worker participates in a strike, the pension will be cancelled. If the company strictly enforces it, most of the company's workers who have served for many years will suffer greatly. Although this is due to an accident, the company still intends not to cancel this pension. (4) The company agrees that all Chinese employees will receive double pay during the strike of tram workers in the Public Concession until the labor strike is resolved. (5) The company agrees not to dismiss workers without sufficient reason in the future. (6) Regarding the 23 requirements, the company has already replied on September 5, and now reiterates its main points as follows: (A) All employees shall have one special leave day for every nine days of work, with full pay (refer to the workers' management method of the Transportation Department). (B) All employees who are given sick leave by the company's doctor (except for venereal diseases and those who are sick due to their own negligence) will be entitled to half pay plus half-price rice allowance, but each time shall not exceed 30 days, and shall not exceed 60 days per year. (C) Employees may take the company's routes 5 and 10 for free, and those wearing uniforms may take all routes, but no more than three people may ride at the same time. (D) The salary of long-term workers shall be calculated monthly and daily. The above conditions will take effect on Sunday morning, September 29, 1940, after all workers have resumed work. If the workers cannot resume work on time, all agreements will be cancelled.

French Concession Labor Strike to Enter Negotiations

After the workers of the French Electric Tramway Co., Ltd. went on strike on the 25th of this month, the workers proposed a total of 16 conditions for improving treatment, which have been formally submitted to the company by representatives appointed by the labor union by letter. The company has translated them into French and handed them over to the General Office and the director of the Transportation Department to study them one by one, and will soon enter negotiations. As for the company's plan to maintain traffic within the concession, trams on routes 2, 7, and 10 were still barely operated under the protection of armed police yesterday. It is heard that Yu Qiaqing and others, after accepting the request of the workers of the French Electric Tramway Co., Ltd., have ordered the workers to first negotiate directly with the company, and then Lao Qiaqing will personally take the post of mediator when necessary, and hope that both labor and management will negotiate in good faith in the spirit of past cooperation to seek a reasonable solution as soon as possible, so as to avoid the expansion of the labor strike affecting the entire traffic and local security. It is heard that the strike committee has appealed to all sectors of society, hoping to provide sympathetic assistance.

Add Vehicles to Facilitate Passengers

According to She Wen She, after the ticket sales strike in the French Concession, the company authorities specially allocated several trams on routes 1, 2, 7, and 10 to run on each route in order to maintain traffic. According to a reporter from She Wen She, the number of trams running has been increasing day by day. Yesterday, a total of 35 locomotives and 19 trailers were dispatched, which is a considerable increase compared to the 23 trams and 13 trailers maintained on the first day of the strike. The company has set the total number of vehicles for today at 40 and 20 trailers to operate and carry passengers. According to the company, it may be able to fully resume operation tomorrow. Although the labor strike has not been resolved, the workers in the factory are sufficient to work on trams on various routes. There are more than 700 ticket sellers and 350 drivers in the company, and more than 400 people have entered the factory one after another. A reporter learned that after the strike, the homes of four drivers and ticket sellers who did not participate in the strike had been broken into by striking workers and debris was destroyed. About 30 workers who caused disturbances were arrested by the French police.

Huge Losses During Strike Period

A reporter from New Voice She learned from various companies yesterday that the workers of the British Electric Tramway Co., Ltd., China General Omnibus Co., Ltd., and French Electric Tramway Co., Ltd. suffered heavy losses due to the shutdown of vehicles during the strike. (1) The British Electric Tramway Co., Ltd. has a total of 250 trams and trolley buses, and the average daily income from September 21 to 28, a total of nine days, is about 28,000 yuan, which is calculated to be 252,000 yuan. (2) The British Public Automobile Company has a total of 150 public automobiles, and the average daily income from September 24 to 28, a total of five days, is calculated to be 24,000 yuan, and the loss is 120,000 yuan. (3) The French Electric Tramway Company has a total of 140 trams and public automobiles. Except for a part of the trams that are barely operating, the public automobiles and trolley buses are all stopped. So far, it has not been satisfactorily resolved, and the company's losses are countless.

### US Admiral Hepburn in Shanghai Watches Far East Situation and Keeps in Touch with Washington at Any Time, and Adheres to Established Policies on Defense Zone Affairs

Since the British troops withdrew from the Central District of the Public Concession, the defense duties left behind have been temporarily undertaken by the Volunteer Corps, which has been more than a month now. Recently, local residents have become increasingly concerned about the situation in the Far East, which is becoming more serious, and hope that the US troops will take over defense as soon as possible. According to a reporter from Pingming She, Admiral Hepburn has held several talks with US Consul General Patrick, Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet, and Colonel Baker, Commander of the US Garrison in Shanghai, on the issue of taking over defense since he arrived in Shanghai, but the content is kept secret and never disclosed to the outside world.

Watching the Entire Far East Situation

Yesterday, it was reported by authoritative sources that Hepburn's mission in Shanghai this time is not only to take over the defense of the Central District, but also to maintain close contact with the US government in Washington on the entire Far East situation at any time. He will never give in to taking over the defense of the Central District of the Public Concession. As for the Public Concession authorities, before the US troops take over the defense, the Volunteer Corps will continue to maintain it until the end of October, and it is scheduled to convene the US Volunteer Corps again from 6:00 p.m. tonight (30th) to defend the Hongkou West District.

US Volunteer Corps to Take Over Defense Tonight

It is found that since the US Volunteer Corps temporarily took over the northern part of Area A, the Japanese side initially opposed the non-British troops of the Volunteer Corps taking over the defense. However, the B Company of the US Volunteer Corps once took over the defense for five days from August 30 to September 4. Later, three teams, including the A Company of the British Volunteer Corps, the Light Cavalry, and the Armored Vehicle Team, took turns to take over. The US decision not to abandon its huge assets and rights in the Central District of the Public Concession is evidenced by the US Volunteer Corps taking over the defense again tonight. According to a reporter's reliable information from the authorities, before the US garrison takes over the defense, the US Volunteer Corps will take over the defense of the district from 6:00 p.m. tonight until 6:00 p.m. on the 4th of next month. After that, it will take turns with the British Volunteer Corps to undertake the defense of the district. The next period is from the 15th to the 19th of next month.

### Thrift and Savings, and Advocate Micro-Donations for Winter Clothing, Issue National Savings Commemorative Stamps

The National Day Commemoration on October 10th is approaching in an instant. It has been previously stipulated by the Central Government that no extravagant celebration ceremonies will be held during the Anti-Japanese War period. Therefore, this year, all parts of the country will not expand the celebration. All circles in this city will promote thrift and savings and the movement to collect winter clothing, so as to fulfill the responsibilities of citizens.

Regarding the "National Construction Savings Movement Commemorative Stamps" initiated and printed by the Kunming Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications, it has been decided to start selling them from October 10th this year. According to a reporter from New Voice She yesterday, the Shanghai Postal Administration has not received the order to sell these stamps, so it is still a question whether they will be sold at that time. It is learned that the design of the stamps is novel and the paper is excellent, which will surely be effective in cultivating the virtue of thrift and promoting national construction savings.

### Former Police Station Patrolman Arrives in England to Join War, Many British Overseas Volunteers to Train in Singapore

Bao Lai, a former Chinese probationary patrolman of the Engineering Bureau Police Station, who is 21 years old, is the eldest son of Dou Jun, a senior official of the Jianghai Customs. After resigning from his job in Shanghai on May 14 this year, he has now received a letter stating that he has arrived by ship and joined the British Royal Air Force as a pilot. There are also many British overseas Chinese living in China who will leave Shanghai to return to their country to join the army and participate in the Anti-Japanese War. Some have submitted applications to the recruitment office in this city and will be sent to Singapore for centralized training before being incorporated into the regular army to participate in the war.

### US Freighter Exits Wusong Port and Sinks Sailboat, Four People, Including the Boss, Drown, Ship Owner Has Serious Negotiations

At about 4:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, a Yong-style sailboat, Jin Bei Ping, loaded more than 90 tons of yellow sand from Sijiao to Shanghai for unloading. When entering Wusong Port, when inspected by the port department's martial law ship as usual, a US freighter "Steel Warrior" (transliteration) suddenly drove in from a distance. The Jin Bei Ping failed to avoid it and was violently hit. The ship sank immediately. Seeing the disaster, the freighter drove away quickly. Fortunately, the port department's martial law ship and other sailboats rushed to rescue with small boats and sampans. As a result, in addition to those rescued from the ship, there were still four people, including the boss Wu Jinshan and passengers Zhu Ade, Wang Shanqing, and Sun Jia Hui, who drowned with the ship. The bodies could not be found, and the situation was very tragic. It is now heard that the owner of the Jin Bei Ping is making serious negotiations with the US freighter, demanding compensation for all losses.

### Engineering Bureau Chinese Directors and Committee Members Express Willingness to Serve as Usual and Will Not Give Advice on Unreasonable Threats

According to the Zilin West News on the 26th of this month, the Chinese directors and committee members of the Engineering Bureau received a threatening letter on the 19th of this month from the so-called Organizing Committee of the Taxpaying Chinese Association in Hongkou, stating that the Chinese directors and committee members were elected by the Taxpaying Chinese Association three years ago, and that no re-election has been held so far, and demanded that each person resign from the position of director and committee member of the Engineering Bureau from the Taxpaying Chinese Association within five days. After verification by reporters, it is true. A certain Chinese director told reporters that such "threatening letters" were received some time ago, and it is not "the most recent such letter was received on the 19th of this month. The Chinese directors and committee members also laughed at it and ignored it. According to the order of the National Government, during the Anti-Japanese War, all public organizations in this city will maintain the status quo before the war, and no re-election will be allowed on the grounds that the Chinese directors and committee members taxpayers continue to elect and re-elect, which is of course completely legal.

### Five Types of Government Bonds to Be Redeemed and Paid Interest Starting Today, Jin Chang to Pay Remittances in Six Installments, and Other Bonds to Be Paid Locally

In order to maintain credit, the Ministry of Finance has allocated special funds to the Central Bank for the principal and interest of domestic government bonds due, in accordance with the regulations of the principal and interest repayment schedule. A reporter from New Voice She learned from the Central Bank yesterday that the method of redeeming and paying interest on government bonds due at the end of September has been implemented in accordance with the method issued by the Ministry of Finance. (1) The tenth redemption and interest payment of the seventeenth year financial long-term government bond will be paid by the four banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture. Shanghai will pay remittances in six installments, which will be paid by the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank and the Shanghai branches of the China and Communications banks entrusted by it. (2) The second interest payment of the first phase of the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China construction government bond and the third interest payment of the second phase of the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China military government bond will be paid by the Central Bank in various places starting from September 30, but the Shanghai Central Branch will not pay the interest on these two government bonds. (3) The eighth redemption and interest payment of the Guangdong Financial Government Bond and the seventh redemption and interest payment of the US dollar bond for dredging the Guangdong-Hong Kong River Project will be paid in full by the Central Bank and the Guangdong Provincial Bank starting from September 30, but the Shanghai Central Branch will not handle the payment of these two government bonds.

### Foreign Exchange Gradually Loosens, Rice Industry Orders Foreign Rice, Rice Market is Unstable, Authorities Should Correct It, Shipping Prices Continue to Rise Without Any Solid Reason

The entire food supply in Shanghai has recently resumed an unstable situation. The prices of domestic and foreign rice have risen frequently again in a short period of time. The highest price of domestic rice has reached a new peak of 90 yuan per stone. However, this trend is definitely due to general hoarding and speculation and manipulation and monopoly. These speculative rice moths are all creating something out of nothing and fabricating right and wrong, which is really not worth a smile from knowledgeable people. However, a small number of rice merchants are moved by it, so they hoard spot goods and try to obtain extra profits, which leads to the entire rice market being tight and loose, and trade is quite difficult. People are crowded, and the market situation is not without chaos, and the relevant rice industry groups in this city have not advised, which really makes the doubts of all sectors difficult to resolve. The Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee also uses the term that it has more than enough heart but not enough strength, and does not advise. However, the frequent rise in rice prices and the proliferation of illegal transactions in the market, the responsibilities of all relevant parties are really important.

Production Prices Decline

It was also learned from various foreign firms that the rise and fall of foreign rice production prices are closely related to the foreign exchange situation. If the foreign exchange is once lengthened, the foreign rice production price will inevitably decline. Recently, due to the gradual decline in the price of gold, the foreign exchange market has gradually loosened, and the foreign rice production price has also decreased slightly compared to the previous days. The detailed price list has not yet been reported by telegram from the various foreign firms. However, it is said that it is not much different from the price determined by the foreign rice evaluation in this city. It is now learned that the various rice industry firms in this city have raised funds for the sake of preparedness and will entrust the French firm Dafu, the British firm Heyi, the Swiss firm Fujia, and the Jianyuan Chinese firm to order a large amount of food rice from the rice production areas of Saigon and Siam by telegram, so as to facilitate the transportation to Shanghai for regulation and to stabilize the entire rice market. It is heard that this batch of unordered foreign rice is planned to be mainly No. 2 Saigon Siam, followed by small twisted, fire twisted, and No. 1 foreign rice, which is said to be a small number. It is heard that the total number is about 150,000 bags. It is also learned that the larger rice firms have directly ordered from Saigon and Siam by telegram. As soon as the transaction is completed, they will hire special ships to transport the rice to Shanghai as soon as possible.

### British Overseas Chinese Mao Han Dies in Car Accident

According to Zilin Newspaper, Mao Han, a Chinese merchant and shareholder of Dehe Foreign Firm at No. 20 Jiujiang Road, was driving his own car along Shanzhong Road at 3:00 p.m. on the 28th. In front of the White Russian Church Hospital, he accidentally collided with a tram heading north. Mao Han was seriously injured and was immediately sent to the White Russian Church Hospital for emergency treatment. He died of his injuries one hour later. According to Mao Han, he was from the New Ruin area of ​​England and has been doing business in Shanghai for 22 years. He is survived by a wife who currently lives in Shanghai. Two sons are currently serving in the military in England. Another son works for Tangsheng Foreign Firm in Hankou. One daughter has married Mr. Ahn and currently lives in Hong Kong.

### Japanese Warship Bombards Chuanshan

The Zhejiang provincial associations in Shanghai yesterday received a telegram from eastern Zhejiang, as follows: (1) Two Japanese warships that were anchored outside Zhenhai Port the day before yesterday, one left at 6:20 this morning, and another Japanese warship sailed in from the north at 6:40. At 10:05, another suddenly sailed southeast. Japanese warships are now cruising back and forth outside Zhenhai Port, but there are no unusual movements. (2) At 10:45 on the morning of the day before yesterday, a Japanese warship sailed from the northwest to the waters off Chuanshan. At 12:40, it suddenly fired five or six shots at Xiashanpu. The shells landed on the sand, causing no loss to us. At 1:54 in the afternoon, the warship headed east, its destination unknown. (3) Also, at 3:20 in the afternoon of the day before yesterday, a Japanese warship sailed from the north to the waters off Shipu. There are now three Japanese warships anchored in the waters off Shipu, but there are no unusual movements. (4) At 7:46 on the morning of the day before yesterday, a sound of machinery was heard from the northwest to northeast of Lihai in Hushan, Yuyao. The Ningbo observation post immediately issued an emergency air raid alert at 7:52. Soon after, two Japanese planes passed over and invaded Zhuji, Shaoxing before fleeing. The alert was lifted at 8:08.

### American Residents in Shanghai Assist Europeans in Shanghai to Contact Their National Organizations and Donate Money and Goods to Aid People of Various Countries

According to the North-China Daily News, some American residents in Shanghai, noting that many European residents in Shanghai have lost contact with their homelands due to the European war, decided to hold a meeting early this week to establish an organization to assist these European residents in Shanghai to connect with their national organizations in the United Kingdom, the United States and elsewhere. The American residents' organization also intends to provide special assistance to other European resident groups in the city, and to distribute donations of funds and goods to the European resident groups for the relief of their respective nationals.

### Reactions in Shanghai Following the German-Italian-Japanese Alliance

The military and economic alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan has now finally come to fruition. Although the government has yet to make a formal statement on this matter, according to general observers, the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan has been brewing for a long time, but it is only now being realized. The impact of this move is less on China than on the United Kingdom and the United States. China, on the other hand, will receive increased assistance from the United Kingdom and the United States, allowing the war effort to become stronger. This can be stated with certainty. The opinions of the well-known commentator Mr. Woodhead and foreign observers are presented separately as follows:

Woodhead's Commentary: U.S. Policy Is Firm

The well-known commentator Mr. Woodhead, in the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" yesterday, gave a summary review of world affairs over the past week. The part about the Far East stated briefly that, although France and Japan have signed an agreement in Hanoi allowing Japanese troops to land in Vietnam, the commander of the Japanese army in South China, Ando, ​​seems to have decided to regard Vietnam as hostile territory. Within hours of the signing of the agreement by Mr. Deguchi and Mr. Nishihara, he violated it. Before the deadline of the Japanese ultimatum had expired, he ignored Nishihara's efforts to limit Japanese military actions to the scope of the agreement, and continued military vehicle operations, occupying Lang Son, bombing Haiphong, and repeatedly attacking the French territory on the Guangxi-Tonkin border. All of these actions resulted in a blatant violation of the Hanoi Agreement.

At the same time, the United States has moved from routine protests to open and practical actions, assisting China's foreign exchange needs with large loans, and imposing an embargo on scrap iron to Japan in mid-October. The U.S. Navy Department is still discussing the issue of borrowing the Singapore base. There are other measures that are sufficient to express the United States' deep displeasure with Japan's actions to disrupt the status quo in the Far East.

As for the so-called "defensive" alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, there is no need for us to be shocked by it. In fact, this is a deliberate and hypocritical masterpiece by Ribbentrop and Ciano. For months, it has been obvious that if Japan were to join the war, it would stand on the side of the Axis powers. Why bother with a so-called "alliance"? One article in the alliance agreement stipulates that "if one of the signatory countries is attacked by a country not currently involved in the European War or the Sino-Japanese War, the three countries shall provide mutual assistance in the political, economic, and military spheres."

The provision of this clause is clearly aimed at the United States, but the term "attack" is not defined. Germany has claimed to have been "attacked" by Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Denmark, and now Japan may as well follow suit and claim to have been "attacked" by Vietnam. In any case, this alliance will not have the slightest impact on the United States' increasingly tough Far East policy.

Foreign Observers Discuss U.S. Aid to China

A Pingming News Agency reporter also asked a foreign international observer about the German-Italian-Japanese alliance yesterday. According to his views:

Initially, the United Kingdom, preoccupied with events in Europe, had no time to look to the East. Although Japan took the opportunity to exert pressure, it was unbearable. The United Kingdom adopted a policy of appeasement and willingly retreated. The Tianjin silver issue was just signed, and the blockade of Hong Kong followed. At the same time, the Yunnan-Burma Road was used as a condition for imposing an embargo. As an independent country, it was under no obligation to comply with this unreasonable request, but in order to avoid disputes, it had no choice but to obey and temporarily impose an embargo for three months. This repeated forbearance ultimately led to the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and to being in opposition. Therefore, it would be necessary to assist China in order to restrain Japan. Regarding the rights and interests previously obtained in the Far East, it was crucial to preserve them. Therefore, the embargo on the Yunnan-Burma Road could be lifted without waiting for its expiration.

As for the United States, although it has always valued justice and has a deep friendship with China, it does not condone the arbitrary actions of aggressive countries to undermine world peace. The resolute abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and the prohibition of scrap iron exports to Japan are precisely a major blow to Japan, in contrast to the UK's appeasement. It can be seen that the aggressors in the Far East tore up the Nine-Power Treaty, expanded their influence, and that security in the Pacific will inevitably be threatened. Knowing that its own military strength is insufficient to fight the enemy, and that the time may not be so short, it is making every effort to prepare domestically and is contacting countries abroad. Knowing that China will certainly be able to hold back Japan, it is constantly providing spiritual and material assistance. Now that the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan has been formed, if it goes further, disaster will inevitably befall the United States itself. If it does not actively assist China, the aggressors will inevitably become more assertive in the future, and there will be a situation that is difficult to suppress. Therefore, after Vietnam allowed Japan to pass through, it immediately lent a large sum of money to China. Now that Germany, Italy, and Japan have allied again, the material assistance in the future will likely not stop there. This can be inferred.

### French Tram Conductor Dies of Serious Injuries; Labor Demands Company Compensation

Regarding the case of Zhang Yongkang, tram conductor number 527 of the French Tram Company, who was shot and injured during a disturbance on tram line 2 the other day, he died of serious injuries at the Aurora Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road yesterday. All his colleagues were very indignant upon hearing the news. According to a representative of the labor side who spoke to the reporter of the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday, the strike committee has decided to visit Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese director of the Municipal Council, again this morning to request that he serve as a mediator. The company should provide generous compensation for the deceased Zhang Yongkang.

### Japan Discriminates Against Third-Country Commerce; UK and U.S. Protest; Japan Cancels Oil Sales Permits, Handing Them Over to Japanese Companies

Asiatic Petroleum, Standard Oil, and Texaco, which sell kerosene and gasoline in Central China, have had to obtain permits from the Japanese military in order to operate. Applications for permits were previously handled by the Japanese Oil Merchants Association. Since mid-July, the Association, under orders from the military, has stopped issuing permits and handed over the business to the Japanese company, Merii Petroleum, which is a blatant discrimination against third-country commerce. The UK and U.S. have lodged serious protests.

### Two Gunshots in the Dark; Japanese Officer Slightly Injured; Rickshaw Puller Shot in Right Arm; Special Martial Law North of the Suzhou Creek

At about 9:30 last night, several Chinese and a Japanese officer in civilian clothes hired rickshaws at the Sika Bridge in Hongkou. When they were passing through the intersection of Haining Road, Beisichuan Road, and Tiantong Road, there were two gunshots in the dark. The bullets flew out and grazed the right ear of the Japanese officer on the last rickshaw, causing a skin wound. The rickshaw puller, Cao Jinlian, was shot in the right arm, and blood flowed down. The rickshaw puller was sent to the Tongren Hospital for treatment by an Indian constable No. 98 of the Hongkou Police Department. After the incident, the Japanese side considered the situation serious and immediately dispatched several marines, who were stationed at various intersections, such as the intersections of Haining Road and Fusheng Road, Laobazi Road, and Beisichuan Road. Four Japanese soldiers were stationed at each location to search pedestrians. The Waibaidu Bridge, the Second Baidu Bridge, the Jiangxi Road Bridge, and the Pintang Lane Bridge were all blocked and closed, and pedestrians were not allowed to pass. At the same time, a strict investigation was conducted around the scene of the incident to find the gunman.

### Bandits Hijack Commuting Car, Kidnap Seven-Year-Old Child; Son of Rice Shop Owner Kidnapped Yesterday Afternoon; Hijacked Car Found Afterwards

A kidnapping case occurred suddenly on Xiaoshadu Road in western Shanghai at 1:37 p.m. yesterday. The kidnapped person was Wu Chengrong (nicknamed Yuangen), the young owner of a rice shop, who was only seven years old. Three kidnappers rented a commuting car from the Haig Road Silver Car Company in advance, drove to the rice shop, hugged the child into the car, and sped away. The details are recorded below:

Child Kidnapped

Wu Yutang, 52 years old, from Pudong, runs the Tongfaxiang Nanhuo Rice Shop at No. 1420 to 1426 Xiaoshadu Road in western Shanghai. It is a four-room shop. Unexpectedly, at 1:37 p.m. yesterday, Wu was handling accounts in the shop when three kidnappers suddenly appeared, all wearing short clothes. One person was on the lookout outside the door, and the remaining two broke open the iron gate and rushed in. Each took out a Mauser pistol. First, one bandit broke into the shop and monitored Wu and four or five shop assistants. The other bandit walked into the back room and went straight into the bedroom. At that time, his wife, Mrs. Su, was sleeping, and a maid was playing with three children on a small couch. The bandit pulled out his gun and shouted loudly. Mrs. Su woke up from her dream and quickly got out of bed. Seeing that the man was holding a Mauser pistol, she knew that he was not a good person and did not dare to speak. The bandit then took the child Chengrong (nicknamed Yuangen) from the small couch, carried him to the entrance of No. 1418, which was adjacent to the south, and put him in a Silver commuting car No. 18257, and drove south and west. His whereabouts are unknown. Afterwards, the shop owner Wu Yutang reported the incident to the Putuo Road Police Station and asked for investigation.

Bandits Hijack Car

It is reported that at about 1:10 p.m. yesterday, two customers suddenly came to the Silver Car Main Station at No. 358 Haig Road, one wearing a long gown and the other wearing short clothes, and came to hire a car. The driver, Chen Yanfa, a local, drove car No. 18257 to the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Kainar Road in western Shanghai. At that time, the two people in the car took out guns and claimed that they needed to borrow the car for a while, stripped off his uniform and hat, and drove Chen away. After hijacking the car, the bandits went to Xiaoshadu Road to kidnap the child Wu Yuangen. At about 4:30, the car was found on Kangnaot Road and Yanping Road. The sentry informed the company and ordered someone to go and claim it. It is said that Wu has three children: the eldest son, Tanggen, is 14 years old and is studying at Aiguang Primary School in Hongshoufang on the same road; the second son, Yuangen, is 7 years old and is in the first grade of Shanghai Primary School in Caoxiebang nearby; and the daughter, Mingyue, is only 6 years old and has not yet attended school.

### Daylight Robbery on Laobazi Road; Large Sum of Money Robbed; Dragged into Car and Thrown Out After Robbery

At 1:45 p.m. yesterday on Laobazi Road in Hongkou, six bandits, two of whom were armed, stopped a pedestrian, prohibited him from shouting, and forcibly dragged him into a certain car parked on the side of the road, speeding east. When they drove to the intersection of Laobazi Road and Beisichuan Road, they threw the person out of the car and fled without a trace. A total of 45,000 yuan in cash was robbed from him. Afterwards, he reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Department and asked them to investigate.

### Descendants of Zhou Fu Jiu Litigate Over Estate; Manager of Yuda Bank Summoned to Testify; Rescheduled for Trial on the 18th

The estate of the late salt merchant Zhou Fuju, totaling 20 million yuan, was inherited by his five sons, and the Zhou Wuchang Hall was established to manage the common property of the five sons. Zhou's fifth son was named Cai Cheng, who died of illness in 1923. Cai Cheng's wife also died of illness in 1926, leaving behind a son named Zhou Pengling, who was only eight years old at the time. Therefore, the property that his father and he himself should have inherited was at the disposal of others.

Private Movable Property of Pengling's Father

At that time, it was inspected and sealed by relatives and friends, totaling 301 boxes, which were stored separately in various rooms. Initially, 39 boxes were entrusted to the eldest son for safekeeping, and the boxes kept by the other sons were also transferred to the eldest son for safekeeping. Pengling is now 22 years old. Because he has no money for tuition, he plans to sell his father's fur clothes to use as tuition. Therefore, last year, he asked Zhou Meiyi Hui (wife of Zhou Zishan, eldest grandson of Zhou Fuju), the property manager of the eldest son, to return

Stored Fur Clothes

23 boxes, valued at 240,000 yuan in national currency. However, Zhou Mei replied evasively. Zhou Pengling has had no results with peaceful negotiations, and recently retained lawyer Dan Yuhua to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special Court, requesting that the defendant Zhou Meishihui be ordered to return 13 boxes of fur clothes. Because the litigation target is as high as 240,000, the litigation fee was only recently paid in full. The court accepted the complaint, and judge Guo summoned him to the Second Civil Court the other day. According to the plaintiff's complaint, the plaintiff's father Zhou Caicheng owed

Yuda Bank

debts during his lifetime, which have been repaid by the Wuchang Hall's public account. The defendant Zhou Mei falsely claimed that her late husband Zhou Shanshan had privately repaid the debt owed by the plaintiff's father to the Yuda Bank, and used 18 boxes of fur clothes as collateral. The defendant now owns millions of assets, but she is using this sleight of hand to try to embezzle the 23 boxes of fur clothes that a lonely young man like the plaintiff is relying on for his studies. In law and in reason,

It cannot be tolerated

However, according to the defendant Zhou Mei's defense, she insisted that the stored fur clothes were indeed used to repay the debt owed to the Yuda Bank. Subsequently, Peng Boqian of the Wuchang Hall's liquidation office testified that the Wuchang Hall had repaid more than 30,000 taels of silver to the Yuda Bank on behalf of Zhou Caicheng. Witness Zeng Duhui also testified that the plaintiff Zhou Pengling had previously auctioned off eight boxes, which he had recorded. The court questioned both parties and witnesses in detail for a long time, and considered it necessary to summon Tian Yushu, the manager of the Yuda Bank. Therefore, it was ordered to postpone the hearing to October 8.

### Boiling Dangerous Oil Materials; Death of Two People; Verdict; Yuan Bingzheng Sentenced for Manslaughter; Civil Lawsuit Transferred to Civil Court for Trial

Yuan Bingzheng, a shareholder of the Taichang Tarpaulin Shop at No. 225 Tokyo Road, and Zhou, a major shareholder who is on the run, instructed an apprentice from Jiangbei, Zhe Afa (17 years old), to put flammable materials such as paint, beeswax, and gasoline in a pot and boil them on a coal stove to make glue for wiping tarpaulin at 9:10 a.m. on the 7th of this month. Due to carelessness, it overturned and caused a fire, resulting in the burning of the two buildings of the tarpaulin shop.

Houses Burned Down

The Chinese and Western detectives of the Gordon Road Police Station arrested Yuan and escorted him to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Later, the Chinese Police Station found that the Taichang Tarpaulin Shop had fire insurance of nearly 6,000 yuan, which seemed to have deliberately

Dangerous Fuel; Instructed apprentice Xin to boil it on the coal stove, causing the disaster. The police station hired a fuel expert to test whether the above materials could be boiled on a coal stove. It was found that gasoline could not be added. The landlord Wang and Meiji's father, Chen Youfa, requested compensation for losses, maintenance fees, consolation money, and

Funeral expenses, etc.

totaling 4,161 yuan in the civil lawsuit. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, requested a severe punishment to warn others not to do the same, disregarding human life. After the final debate, they waited for the sentence. Judge Jiang Shuzi came to court yesterday and sentenced Yuan Bingzheng to one year of imprisonment for causing death by negligence. The attached civil lawsuit was transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial.

### Four Robbers Charged with Robbery and Extortion

The criminal robbers Hu Kouxi and Yang Shiwen from Anhui, Wang Jiajin from Tongzhou, and in Amao etc from Ningbo, wrote threatening letters between the 13th and 27th of this month and delivered them to Wu Shaowu, the owner of the Lichengxing Canning Factory at No. 318 Baoding Road, demanding 50,000 yuan unsuccessfully. They also robbed lead bars and lead skins worth more than 500 yuan, and robbed Qiao Xiaolai of more than 100 yuan in cash at No. 6 Tangshan Road. The case was investigated and the Chinese and Western detectives of the Huishan Police Station arrested them. Judge Huang Risheng came to court yesterday to continue the trial. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, filed a lawsuit on charges of robbery and writing threatening letters to extort money, requesting a severe punishment. The court appointed lawyer Jiang Rong to provide free legal aid once, and then ordered them to be returned to custody to await sentencing.

### French Tram Conductor Suddenly Disappears

Li Shengyong from Pudong has been a conductor for the French Tram Company for more than ten years and has a long history. He has now been promoted to chief conductor and his monthly salary has also increased to 130 yuan. He has always worked diligently and has been deeply trusted by the company. During the strike by workers of the French Water and Electricity Tram Company to demand wage increases and improved treatment, the company, under the strict protection of the police authorities, selectively dispatched vehicles to run on various routes to maintain transportation, and Li Shengyong worked even harder, which caused jealousy. On the morning of the 26th of this month, Li went from home to the company to work and disappeared en route. It is said that Li was kidnapped. So far, there is no news or trace of him. His family is very anxious and reported the incident to the company, which in turn reported it to the police authorities, who sent personnel to visit and investigate Li's whereabouts.

Now, the Huaguang Communications Agency at No. 44 Yunnan Road, etc., has printed a detailed novel about the case, titled "Human Change," which has been published. The Political Department of the Public Concession believes that this book promotes crime and has reported it to the Legal Department for review and prosecution in accordance with the Publishing Law. After reviewing the case, the lawyers of the Legal Department, such as Ru Baoyi, determined that the book "Human Change" did not violate the provisions of the Publishing Law, and did not harm good morals or disrupt public order. The contents recorded were the facts of the entire case and the lives of the characters, and some of them had been published in newspapers. Therefore, it could not be determined that it promoted crime, and it was decided not to prosecute and the original case was returned to the Political Department.

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### The Rules to Abide by in Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

— Qiu Lang

In these extraordinary times, especially for the salaried class, maintaining these four essential elements of "clothing, food, housing, and transportation" is indeed not easy! Therefore, for these four elements, we must not only be frugal but also abide by rules. In our interactions with others, we should be strict with ourselves and lenient with others, emphasizing etiquette and maintaining a humble and gentle demeanor. I dare not use moralistic language to exhort the masses, but it can at least avoid many disputes.

Clothing: In this difficult era, we should advocate wearing old clothes. Wearing old clothes is not shameful, as long as they are washed and kept clean, and folded neatly. Shoes and hats should be brushed free of dust regularly. When dressing, hats should be worn straight, and buttons should be fastened. We should also instruct our children to do the same, as I often see people who are well-dressed themselves but neglect their families and children, which easily leads to being looked down upon and criticized.

Food: In social gatherings, celebrations, and condolences, it is always appropriate to be humble when using chopsticks during banquets. Limit alcohol consumption to a maximum of eight parts out of ten. Never be too greedy, wolf down food, or get drunk! The host may not feel comfortable speaking out, but it greatly annoys other guests! Overeating is also harmful to oneself. Even in daily meals, eat vegetables before meat, do not reach across the table indiscriminately, and do not take more than your share. This avoids making colleagues uncomfortable and sets a good example for the family.

Housing: Speaking of housing, it is common for several families to live in one house during this time of soaring housing prices. However, when sharing housing for economic reasons, mutual humility is most important! Each family should have the mindset that "taking a loss is a gain," and be willing to give way to others, which will naturally lead to peaceful coexistence. However, there are many disputes among cohabitants, all because they cannot understand each other, leading to arguments. Sometimes, children's mischief can also cause trouble, in which case adults should blame their own children to show reasonableness, and the dispute will subside.

Transportation: Human beings have two legs, and their function is to walk. Regular walking can promote blood circulation and strengthen muscles and bones. It is both economical and hygienic. However, lazy people must use cars instead of walking, considering it more dignified not to exert themselves. You must know that in these times, we should be diligent and endure hardship. What does walking a little way matter! However, if the distance is far or there is an urgent matter, we must rely on cars. We should also take cheaper public buses and trams, and give way to women and children when boarding and alighting. We should also let them sit first when the bus is crowded. This is what we should do in terms of reason.

### The Key Points of Children's Clothing

— Yun Lin

Children's clothing has a significant impact on their health. The following are the points that must be noted for parents' reference.

(A) Fabric of the clothes: (1) It should be soft, (2) It should be absorbent, (3) It should be smooth and not irritate the skin, (4) It should be easy to wash.

(B) Colors of the clothes: Clothes absorb external temperature differently depending on the color. Colored clothes absorb more than white clothes. Furthermore, many dyes in clothing contain irritating pigments such as antimony, arsenic, lead, copper, mercury, zinc, and aniline. If these pigments adhere to the body, they can sometimes inflame children's delicate skin.

(C) Style of the clothes: Because children's bodies are not fully developed, all parts appear very weak. Therefore, all sizes and styles should be loose and not too tight.

(D) Skin secretions excrete waste from the body, so clothes should be absorbent to absorb dirt and not accumulate on the body.

### A Discussion on Lunch

— Zheng Yimei

Everyone values the issue of eating. No wonder the ancients had the saying "The people regard food as heaven." In our ordinary lives, we mostly have three meals a day. That is, we have some snacks in the morning and two meals at noon and in the evening. I have a small discussion about lunch, believing that snacks should be eaten at noon and meals in the morning. What is the reason for this? Allow me to explain below.

Didn't Ziyu氏 say: "　飱而治"? Note: "Cooked food. 朝曰　, 夕曰飱," It can be seen that the ancients originally ate meals in the morning. Why do I only mention morning and evening and not noon? To this day, we still follow this habit, calling what we eat in the morning breakfast. Some country folk actually get up and eat breakfast in the morning. However, they eat meals again at five o'clock and in the evening. I remember one year when I went to Lili, a town in the Suzhou countryside, to attend a wedding feast. I stayed there for many days. They had snacks in the morning, calling it breakfast, and called lunch snacks instead. On the first day, they prepared lunch, but the servant came to invite me to have snacks. I didn't understand, so I replied that I had already had snacks. The servant laughed and said that snacks here meant lunch. Only then did I suddenly realize, and I couldn't help but laugh. From this, it can be seen that eating snacks at noon and meals in the morning must have been around for a long time. Later, only the name remained, and the reality was not pursued. If we can really eat meals in the morning, then every household will naturally follow Zhu Bailu's creed of "getting up at dawn," buying vegetables, cooking rice. After filling their stomachs, they go to work. At noon, they only need to prepare some bread or biscuits. In less than ten minutes, a lunch is solved. Wouldn't that save a lot of time and increase work efficiency? Furthermore, high-ranking officials, such as managers, big bosses, bank presidents, and compradors, do not need to drive motorcycles back home at noon, eat, and then drive motorcycles back to work. Several gallons of gasoline can be saved each month. If one person does this, and it is extended to a place and a country, the total will definitely be surprising. Material resources, financial resources, and human resources are saved, which is very beneficial to the anti-Japanese resistance, isn't it? Those middle and lower-level employees do not have to go outside to find small restaurants or diners to eat cheap meals, and they do not have to trudge through rain and snow. In terms of time allocation, assuming that dinner is eaten at six o'clock in the evening and breakfast is eaten at seven o'clock the next morning, it is a total of thirteen hours. After this long period of time, the stomach is empty, so it is more appropriate to eat a solid meal. If snacks are eaten in the morning, lunch is eaten at twelve o'clock, and dinner is eaten at six o'clock in the evening, there are only six hours from twelve o'clock to six o'clock. It would be too uneven to eat two meals during this time. Some people say that they often cannot eat when they get up in the morning. What should be done about this? I believe that this is due to not being accustomed to it. If it can be practiced regularly, then it will become natural, and there will be no difficulty. I believe that this issue is more practical than the summer daylight saving time, and it is not limited to the season, but can be implemented all year round.

### The Difficulty of Traveling

— Sui Zhen

Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four essential elements of life. Now, apart from clothing, food, and housing, which have already suffered serious threats, the element of "transportation" has recently encountered the biggest trouble. The recent strikes by tram and bus workers are an example. From a general perspective, each side has its own standpoint, which cannot be criticized too harshly. However, those of us in the salaried class come into contact with trams or buses almost every day. Since the successive strikes, black-plated cars have always been out of reach, and we cannot afford business cars either. The cost of one trip is three or four yuan. The reward for a day's hard work is only that much, so we dare not even dream of it. Then, to have something stable, fast, cheap, and all-inclusive, we can only ask rickshaws for help. But it is shameful to say that the arrogance of rickshaw pullers has risen above ours in the past few days. The prices they demand are high, and their attitude is tough, just like when we moved from the Nanshi to the concession during the "August 13th" incident. This really makes people not know what to do. But the time to go to the office is fixed, and being late will result in a painful deduction of salary. In desperation, I had to trouble my two legs, on which I have relied all my life. Although these size eleven "cars" cannot be compared with eight-cylinder sedans, roads must be walked. If you are determined to walk, and you have identified the direction, there will eventually be a time when you arrive. The path of life and the success of learning and career are no exception. As the saying goes: "Sincerity can penetrate metal and stone." This is an exaggeration compared to walking, but it is not an exaggeration to describe my or most people's mood at the time. It just so happened that it was drizzling that morning, and the asphalt road was particularly slippery. It took a full hour to walk from Connaught Road to Jiangxi Road, which was like the line in Peking opera, "Galloping all night." I barely made it to the office in a state of panic. Looking back, the edge of my long gown was covered in mud, and I was drenched in sweat. Before I could catch my breath, I started working, and I didn't have time to think about anything else. It wasn't until dusk that I stumbled back home. Looking at the pedestrians on the road, although it wasn't as lively as in the past, the various private cars in front of the ××× Theater and the ×× Restaurant were still lined up in a long snake-like formation, looking majestic and beautiful. I thought that they could get the highest material enjoyment. By contrast, they could be considered the darlings of heaven. As I walked and pondered slowly, a streamlined sedan suddenly came from behind and sped past like lightning. Before I could dodge, I was splashed with mud. Looking closely, the car had already gone far. A dog's head was still sticking out of the car window. Needless to say, it must have been a ××× breed pet dog raised by the car owner. I was indignant and felt that my legs were a little sore. So I lowered my head and continued forward, enduring until I got home, already exhausted. I hurriedly took off my dirty clothes and fell asleep.

The night enveloped the earth. The radio upstairs and the sound of mahjong downstairs were deafening. In addition, the rustling autumn rain outside the window, mixed with a few bursts of cold air, brought together all kinds of sorrows. Thoughts surged in my mind, and I couldn't fall asleep. I reached for a book of Tang poetry for entertainment. After flipping through a few pages, I read an ancient poem, "The Road to Shu Is Difficult." I couldn't help but throw down the book and deeply sighed, "The difficulty of traveling."

### Utilizing Waste

— Jian Hua

After reading Mr. Zi Fang's "Methods of Utilizing Old Socks" in the issue of the 26th of last month, according to what the author knows, in addition to what Mr. Zi Fang mentioned, there are several other utilization methods, which are written below:

(1) Making shoe sole thread: Twist the socks into shoe sole thread according to Mr. Zi Fang's method and use it to sew the soles of cloth shoes, which is economical and durable.

(2) Making sleeves: Cut off the lower half of old socks (i.e., the sock bottom and the small sock part), sew binding on the cut end, and put it on the sleeves of children's clothes to prevent the sleeves from getting dirty.

(3) Making belts: Cut off the sock bottoms of women's long torn stockings, leaving only two sock parts, sew them together with a needle, and use them as belts, which are soft and comfortable.

In addition, old socks can also be used to wrap wounds, which is ventilated and comfortable and suitable for hygiene. All of these are economical ways to live in these extraordinary times.

Spring and Autumn

### On Eliminating Labor Unrest

— Xiao Kangshi

Wage increases are not enough to eliminate future labor unrest. Curbing speculation and hoarding is the fundamental solution.

Since the Incident, more than three years have passed. Prices have soared several times higher than before the war. Shanghai's goods rely on other places for supply, so the high prices are to be expected. However, the price of vegetables in remote small towns is almost the same as in Shanghai. Today, it is not just local areas that are suffering; everyone is struggling in difficult circumstances, hoping to see the light again. Therefore, for workers earning a living in Shanghai, how many can support their families with a salary of tens of dollars, whether their families live in Shanghai or in the countryside? The recent labor unrest has spread like rampant weeds. The cause is the oppression of high living costs.

Therefore, many people believe that reasonable wage increases are the only good way to eliminate today's labor unrest, because workers will have stable lives and will not have the motivation to strike. Although this is a valid point, it is a superficial solution that does not address the root cause. Looking at the successive strikes today, the unstable state of society is already apparent. However, general speculators, manipulators, and hoarders are not only unmoved by this situation but also take advantage of the opportunity to stir up trouble and intensify their actions. The recent soaring rice prices are affecting society, and the danger is a hundred or a thousand times greater than the strike wave.

Therefore, if the capital side reluctantly increases wages, it may eliminate today's labor unrest. However, if the speculators, manipulators, and hoarders continue to intensify their actions, living costs will inevitably rise even higher in the future. Then, in the near future, it will be difficult to avoid a second or third strike. Therefore, using wage increases to eliminate labor unrest is only a "superficial solution" and not a "fundamental solution." However, in these dangerous times, there is no other way but to increase wages.

Therefore, from today onwards, we should immediately seek a "fundamental solution to eliminate future labor unrest," such as curbing speculation and manipulation, severely investigating speculators and hoarders, and unblocking sources. We should use bold methods without suspicion. Those with a little conscience should also take the overall situation into consideration during these difficult times and not prioritize power and wealth over the country. They should stimulate their conscience and save the country and the people. Then, it will not be difficult to suppress prices. If prices are suppressed, the people's lives can be stabilized, and there will be no reason for labor unrest to brew. This is like a weak and sick body that should be well-maintained to replenish qi and blood so that any "wind evil cannot take advantage of the weakness to enter." I ask those in power and those who care about society, what do you think?

### Chestnuts

— Mo Fei

I ran into a fruit shop, and a thick cloud of smoke filled the air. I faintly heard the sound of cracking and bursting, and at the same time, a strange fragrance mixed with the smell of pine resin drilled into my nostrils.

"Chestnuts are on the market!" The red characters on the white paper were very eye-catching!

Chestnuts are my favorite. My feet stopped involuntarily.

The bag was the same size as last year, but the price had doubled—two cents per bag.

I took the chestnuts home in my sleeve. The children came to greet me. The older one tugged at my sleeve and immediately discovered them. "What is it? Oh, chestnuts!"

"Chestnuts! Chestnuts!" The younger children also shouted.

I had to take them out. I poured them all out and asked the oldest to count them. There were eleven in total. Two cents, eleven chestnuts!

We divided them equally among three people: three chestnuts per person, with two remaining. I gave them to my wife to try as well.

But these three chestnuts were too meager in the children's eyes. They felt a little unsatisfied, so my wife divided her two chestnuts among them and coaxed them, "Be good, don't quarrel. Dad will buy more next time, buy three bags." Then, she said as if to herself, "Eleven chestnuts for two cents, it's really too expensive. Living is really difficult with Liangxiang chestnuts!"

The conclusion was almost a sigh! In fact, my wife knows the difficulty of life better than I do. "Living is really difficult with Liangxiang chestnuts!" Now we can sing this for those of us who rely on a small salary to live!

"I won't buy them next time! I've tasted them, that's enough." I said to my wife.

### Small Speculators, It's Time to Wake Up

— Jun Cai

I have been in the gold speculation market for quite some time, so I know the inside story. Here is a summary:

I work as a small clerk in a silver company that provides trading services for customers in Shanghai. Every morning before nine o'clock, the company is full of customers (small speculators). These people are all ordinary people (mostly unemployed businessmen). Although there are one or two people from special classes (referring to the wealthy), they seem to be addicted. They arrive on time every morning, rain or shine. If they are absent for a day, at least several phone calls will be made to inquire about the market. As a result, these small speculators are very unfortunate. Not only do they waste valuable time every day, but they also lose money on transportation and meals, and they are constantly worried. At the end of the month, they still lose their capital.

At the end of the month, the company summarizes the accounts. The total profit of the customers is about five thousand, while the total loss is over forty or fifty thousand. On average, more than nine out of ten customers lose money. Even if they are lucky enough to make a profit, the amount is very small. The silver companies, money shops, and firms that provide customer services benefit the most.

Small speculators' golden dreams, it's time to wake up!

The Hawthorne Case

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Eight: Two People Caught

I patiently remained silent throughout the car ride. When the car drove to the entrance of the apartment on Avenue Edward VII, I was secretly pleased, thinking that he couldn't remain a silent statue once he got to the apartment. Because the words "still far" that he said really made me feel confused.

Shi Gui greeted us with a happy face and led us inside. Auntie Su had already set the table and brought the food. Hawthorne put down his hat and immediately sat down at the table, pouring another bucket of cold water on me. "Bao Lang, eat quickly, we'll talk later."

Hawthorne usually does not follow Confucius's motto of "don't talk while eating." This was another clear way of not letting me speak while eating. What did this mean? Was he really extremely hungry, unable to do two things at once, and busy eating? No, because after picking up his chopsticks, he only ate a shallow bowl of rice, which was only a quarter of his usual amount. He put down his chopsticks and sat down on the sofa that he usually sits on. I wasn't very hungry, and influenced by him, my appetite was greatly reduced as well. When Auntie Su came in to clear the table, she also had a surprised look on her face, but seeing the cold look on Hawthorne's face, she didn't dare to say much. After a while, we both lit cigarettes. My suppressed questions finally couldn't be held back any longer.

"Hawthorne, what exactly is going on? From my point of view, this case is progressing very smoothly. Why do you still look so troubled?"

Hawthorne exhaled a puff of smoke, looked at the floor, and replied, "I couldn't stand his cold laugh."

I quickly said, "His cold laugh? Are you talking about Zhao Boxiong?"

Hawthorne nodded, not answering.

I continued, "Strange, his laugh made you so upset. Are you arguing with him? Don't you always say that detectives should maintain their rationality and not be dominated by feelings? Now you're acting like this because of his cold laugh, isn't that ridiculous?" (122)

### Fundraising for the Young Women's Christian Association

— Nan Ping

After reading the article "A Letter to Female Students Soliciting Donations for the Construction of the Young Women's Christian Association," I was very moved. Although I am a male student, based on the help the Young Women's Christian Association has given me in the past, I would like to also "tell" the male students from the perspective of a male student:

Since Shanghai became an "isolated island," the direct impact on the students has been twofold: First, the school buildings are small, the equipment is simple, the classrooms are dimly lit, and there is a lack of student dormitories and rest rooms. Second, there is no proper extracurricular entertainment. In the past three years, the Young Women's Christian Association has done its best to allow young male and female students to pour in. Every space in their already crowded association has been freed up for students to study, rest, play ball, and exercise, regardless of gender. Therefore, I say that the Young Women's Christian Association provides services to male students equal to those provided to female students.

Now, the Young Women's Christian Association is facing its most difficult time. The work has expanded extensively, but the association's facilities are insufficient. During this time of housing panic, the landlord will not even allow them to stay in this "insufficient space" any longer; not only are they openly building houses on the beautiful lawn in front, but the old building hidden in the back can only be occupied until August of next year. Are we willing to let such an organization with a long history and contribution to society disappear? No, absolutely not! Then we can only stand on the same front as the Young Women's Christian Association and do our part to help promote the building donation of the Young Women's Christian Association.

I hope that male students will seize this good opportunity to serve society and contribute generously. Everyone should do their part. In the future, when the student hall of the Young Women's Christian Association is built, we can also take a deep breath and say, "I have a part in this."
