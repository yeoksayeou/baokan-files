### Anti-Aggression Policy Not Just Empty Words: US Decides to Actively Aid China; Knox Explains Six Key Points of Defense Plan; British Far East Commander-in-Chief Takes Office in Singapore

Boston:  Navy Secretary Colonel Knox, speaking here yesterday, promised that the United States would increase its aid to China. Colonel Knox also briefly outlined six key points of the defense plan. He made an impromptu speech at a meeting here, declaring that the differences between democracy and totalitarianism are irreconcilable, and therefore the war must be fought to the end. Knox briefly mentioned the key points of the defense program, stating: "First, we should do everything possible to help Britain, without endangering our own security. Second, we should be concerned about China. I hope we can soon aid China to the same extent we are currently aiding Britain. Third, we will expand our military greatly, regardless of cost. Over-preparation, even if premature and excessive, is better than being too late and insufficient. Fourth, we will not appease anyone in the world. Fifth, we will work diligently without boasting. Sixth, we will strengthen our resolve and spirit, because only through self-sacrifice can we achieve self-preservation." Knox further stated, "The war between democracy and totalitarianism can only be reconciled in the manner of the American Civil War. If the evolution of the world is to continue, then this kind of war should continue to the very end." He said that the need for national unity is greater today than ever before. He said that the presidential election proved that the American people are not intimidated by external threats. The next five years will be a difficult test for the United States. Finally, Knox said, "We should prioritize national security above all else, and business interests should be secondary." (United Press, 15th)

Washington:  US government officials last night declined to comment on London's announcement that British reinforcements had arrived in the Far East to help contain Japan's southward advance. It is widely believed that the State Department is closely monitoring developments in the Far East, including rumors that Japan has made another move towards the south, possibly seizing Saigon. Officials here responded to Navy Secretary Colonel Knox's remarks in Boston last night, saying that the time for empty words is over, and America's future stance will be reflected in concrete actions. Recalling Colonel Knox's statement in Boston that the government's new policy is to "work diligently without boasting," unofficial sources here indicated that women and children in the Far East, if they decide to accept Washington's repeated advice to evacuate, will leave the Far East within a month. One unofficial observer remarked last night, "We are therefore free to act." It is believed here that after three evacuee ships return to the United States next month, the government will consider its obligation to warn Americans to evacuate the Far East fulfilled. It is still widely rumored here that Britain, the United States, and Australia have established, or are about to establish, a Pacific joint defense agreement. Last week, President Roosevelt told reporters that this news from London did not originate from the highest official levels. However, neither here nor in London has this rumor been denied. Regarding the meeting earlier this week between Navy Secretary Knox, Army Secretary Stimson, and Secretary of State Hull, no statement has yet been issued. It is understood that they discussed plans to strengthen US naval and military strength in the Far East, especially in the Philippines. (United Press, 15th)

Rangoon:  The new British Far East Commander-in-Chief, Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, who arrived in Singapore yesterday to take office, recently passed through here as a guest of the Governor of Burma. Brooke-Popham has previously visited Malaya, Iraq, and India. (Reuters, 15th)

London:  According to the "Daily Telegraph" diplomatic correspondent, Sir Robert Brooke-Popham's appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Far East is the result of discussions by the Army, Navy, and Air Force Committee on how best to coordinate the British and Dominion land and air forces to defend Singapore. Brooke-Popham does not control the Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, whose responsibilities extend beyond the defense of Malaya. (Reuters, 15th)

Chongqing:  The Central Daily News this morning published an editorial stating that it seems unlikely that the United States and Japan will wage a major war in the Pacific. A major war in the Pacific requires extensive preparations, including the concentration of transport ships, war materials, troops, aircraft, and warships, as well as land preparations. Japan would not dare to advance south unless it had signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. Moreover, the United States does not need to attack Japan; a blockade alone would be enough to cripple it. Chinese circles here say that the British government's establishment of the position of Far East Commander-in-Chief indicates that Britain is determined to contain Japan's southward expansion. (Reuters, 15th)

### Soviet Side States: Aid-China Policy Unchanged

Moscow: United Press reported, "Diplomatic sources say that Japan and the Soviet Union have reached an agreement to divide spheres of influence in the Far East, including the Soviet Union agreeing to stop aiding China." TASS has been authorized to declare that this report is completely false. (TASS, 15th)

### Overseas Chinese in Dutch East Indies Donate Quinine

Beipei: According to an announcement by the authorities, the overseas Chinese in Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, recently donated 1.9 million quinine tablets to the motherland, which are being shipped back to the motherland via Rangoon. (Havas, 15th)

### Japanese Emperor Receives War Minister Tojo

Tokyo: Political figures here believe that the Japanese Emperor's audience with War Minister General Tojo yesterday morning is closely related to the cabinet meeting held by the Emperor on Wednesday. The resolutions of that meeting are currently being kept strictly secret, and diplomatic and political circles are speculating extensively on the matter. Japanese newspapers prominently published news of the meeting and the Emperor's audience with Tojo, but made no comment. (Reuter, 15th)

Tokyo: Former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Navy in the South China Sea, Vice Admiral Kosaka, recently returned to Tokyo and was received by the Emperor yesterday to report on the situation of the Japanese fleet in the South China Sea. (Reuter, 15th)

### All Outlying Strongholds of Zhennanguan Captured by Chinese Troops; Japanese Reinforcements Fail in Counterattack; Chinese Troops Triumphantly Enter Qinzhou

Longzhou: The Japanese troops on the Zhennanguan front, using Lang Son, Vietnam, as a supply line, have reinforced their counterattacks in recent days. However, the Chinese troops, making use of advantageous terrain, fiercely struck back and on the 13th recaptured all outlying strongholds of Zhennanguan. (15th dispatch)

Chongqing: Military circles here officially announced today that Chinese troops triumphantly entered Qinzhou yesterday morning. As a result, all Japanese troops in southwestern Guangxi and Guangdong provinces have completely retreated. The Japanese troops in Qinzhou boarded transport ships near Longmen Port on the night of the 13th and sailed out to sea. According to Chinese sources, Chinese troops also attacked Luoshan, east of Xinyang, on the 7th of this month. Well-informed circles believe that the Japanese troops may soon withdraw from Yichang. The airfield there is now frequently bombarded by Chinese artillery, and the Japanese troops are no longer using it. Military circles here said that the recent attack by Japanese troops in Yichang on Chinese positions in the suburbs was likely a cover for their retreat, as the Japanese troops must hold the outer defenses of the port in order to defend Yichang, and the outposts have recently been abandoned one by one. (Reuters, 15th)

Chongqing: At a press briefing here yesterday, a Chinese military spokesman said that as the Japanese troops retreated from Nanning, the rearguard troops fought bravely to protect the embarkation of the main force, and the Japanese troops withdrawing towards Vietnam launched another counterattack on Zhennanguan, but were again repelled. The spokesman said that Chinese troops could soon enter Qinzhou. In the past week, Chinese troops have advanced to within one kilometer of the suburbs of Yichang. As a result, Chinese artillery bombardment of the Japanese airfield has caused heavy damage to the Japanese aircraft parked there. (Reuter, 15th)

Zhaoqing: At around 6:00 AM this morning, part of the Japanese troops in Sanshui advanced in three directions towards Huangtang and Fanhuao, south of Chinese territory. The main force focused on the south and reached Qichantou around 10:00 AM. After a fierce attack near Xianjueyuan Village in Xiacun, they retreated towards Shiyuettangbin. Part of the force that attacked Huangtang from the Xiaolukeng area is currently facing off against Chinese troops. Another force that attacked Fanhuao was also intercepted by Chinese troops. (14th dispatch)

Nanning: The new Nanning is rapidly developing. The deserted streets and alleys of ten days ago are now filled with smoke from cooking fires and are full of life. Shops on all main thoroughfares are busy cleaning up the dirt and decorating their facades in preparation for resuming business. Some, because their shops have been abandoned for too long and cannot be repaired in time, are selling the goods they had stored last year. However, as the city's population increases daily, goods are in short supply. According to reliable statistics, from the 6th to the 13th, 22,057 members of the local militia returned to the city, and more are still arriving in an endless stream, averaging about 5,000 new arrivals per day. (14th dispatch)

Hong Kong: According to reliable sources from Guilin and Nanning, at least some detached units from the Japanese 3rd Division, which withdrew from Guangxi, are now moving to Guangdong Province to strengthen security. The munitions and supplies for these reinforcements have now arrived in Shenzhen, north of Hong Kong. While the motive for the reinforcements is to deal with international matters, another reason is to cut off the main smuggling route for Chinese forces at Shark River in Mirs Bay. Zengcheng, north of the East River, also needs additional reinforcements, as the city was attacked by regular Chinese forces last week. Mobile units attacked the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and Shilong and Yichashan (transliteration) at the confluence of the East River. These attacks occurred when the Japanese troops were transferred to Guangxi and Xinan, so reinforcements are still needed there. It is understood that more than 800 wounded soldiers from Guangxi have returned to Guangzhou and Huangpu. They had left before the announcement of the Japanese withdrawal from Nanning. Rumors that the Japanese troops will also withdraw from Guangzhou have caused the value of the Japanese military scrip to plummet. However, Chinese high command expects that the number of Japanese troops in Guangzhou will increase significantly this weekend. Residents of Taoshan (transliteration) and Heping near the West River Delta received warnings of a Japanese attack from Jiangmen. An official hinted in a statement that due to pressure from the Japanese troops, the two places may be abandoned. However, this statement was later refuted by General Li Hanshun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, and the central authorities. They assured the residents of the two places that they would defend their hometowns at all costs. The residents of Taoshan and Heping have contributed significantly to the war effort, so Chinese troops who had been transferred to the front lines have been replaced by other Chinese forces, so that the original troops can be recalled to protect the two places. Regarding the Japanese withdrawal from Guangxi, Chinese announcements state that although this was not due to a "direct attack" by Chinese troops, it was a victory for the Chinese "strategic offensive," forcing the Japanese troops, who had occupied Guangxi for eleven months and six days, to withdraw in time. According to Chinese announcements, the number of Japanese casualties in Guangxi, including those who died of disease, totaled 74,000. Chinese officials continued, "The lack of reinforcements for the Japanese troops was also a factor in their withdrawal. Chinese mobile units and guerrillas attacked Japanese supply convoys on the Yong-Qin Highway day and night to intensify the economic blockade. As a result, the Japanese troops often suffered from food shortages, and the terrain was rugged and prone to disease, so the Japanese troops were under great pressure."

### Zhang Qun, Chairman of Sichuan, to Take Office on Schedule

Chongqing: The new Chairman of Sichuan Province, Zhang Qun, is scheduled to take office on the 18th. It is generally believed that after Zhang takes charge of Sichuan's administration, he will first solve the rice problem. (Havas Dispatch, 15th)

Chongqing: After the Executive Yuan appointed Zhang Qun to concurrently hold the position of Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce sent a congratulatory telegram. The text of the telegram is as follows: "To Chairman Zhang Qun of the Sichuan Provincial Government: We have just learned that Your Excellency has been appointed to administer Sichuan's affairs. Your talent and prestige are widely respected, and the whole of Sichuan is rejoicing. We expect that you will be diligent in construction and make great plans. We hereby send this telegram to offer our congratulations. Please accept our sincere regards. Respectfully, the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations, with bowed heads, offer this message." (15th Dispatch)

Chongqing: The National Government is currently busy stockpiling military supplies and war materials, enough to continue fighting for at least three more years. Today, a high-ranking official here denied rumors that a food shortage had occurred in Sichuan and that friction had arisen between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The official said that the new Chairman of Sichuan is a high-ranking official of the Central Government, and his appointment has been warmly welcomed by the people and leaders of Sichuan. The official also told Reuters that the Communist army has complied with the agreement reached with the Central Government and has moved to the designated location. (Reuters, 15th)

Chongqing: According to Chengdu news, in order to eliminate opium addiction in Sichuan Province, Generalissimo Chiang has divided the province into four areas for the prohibition of opium and has established special courts in each area to try opium addicts. According to past practice, opium smokers must be sent to the headquarters for opium prohibition for investigation. (Havas Dispatch, 15th)

### Organizing a Journalism Association

Chongqing: China's journalism has a long history, but it has not been fully developed due to the lack of a comprehensive and sound organization. In view of this, journalists in the wartime capital, Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Jiluan, Xiao Tongzi, Chen Bosheng, and others, have initiated the organization of the Chinese Journalism Association to study journalism, improve China's journalism. The preparatory committee of the association has now received letters and telegrams of support from journalistic circles in Chengdu, Kunming, Gansu, Ningxia, Xi'an, Luoyang, Hengyang, Hong Kong, Guiyang, Guilin, Qinghai, Shaoguan, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Enshi, Henan, Jinhua, Shanghai, and other places, and has sent letters to Yu Youren, Zhang Ji, Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, Chen Guofu, Wu Zhihui, Dai Jitao, Wang Shijie, Chen Lifu, Zhu Jiahua, Shao Lizi, Chen Bulei, and Wu Tiecheng to serve as sponsors. All organizational matters are being actively carried out, and the association will soon be formally established. (15th dispatch)

Wu told reporters that the Allied countries' material and moral assistance to China would not only strengthen Sino-British cooperation, but would also enable the two countries to establish close ties in the Far East in the future. (15th dispatch)

### Changsha Authorities Suppress Prices

Changsha: Xue Yue, Chairman of Hunan Province, considering that the steep rise in prices in Changsha has had a great impact on the people's livelihood, has ordered the Changsha County Government to work with the Chamber of Commerce to find ways to suppress prices. First, standard prices will be set for several commodities, including oil, rice, and coal. The prices are set at 15 yuan per shi for rice, 1.8 yuan per dan for coal, 5.5 jiao per jin for oil, and 5 jiao per jin for pork. The market traded according to the new prices on the 15th, and things were quite calm. However, due to demand exceeding supply, the authorities are trying to increase the supply of goods.

Editorial

### Second Safety Campaign

Last June, a safety campaign was held in the Shanghai International Settlement. During the campaign, the results were remarkable. Now, more than a year later, the second campaign is about to begin. Recalling the usual situation, traffic order is not well-maintained; moreover, the statistics on traffic accidents and deaths show that last year had the highest number in the past twenty years. The causes are various and not coincidental. It is certainly not reasonable to say that the safety campaign has led to an increase in traffic accidents. The responsibility for accidents is not entirely on the vehicles; for example, pedestrians often stand outside the sidewalks and in the middle of the road, and even when vehicles are driving close together, they still try to squeeze across the road. Some even risk crossing before the green light comes on. If an accident occurs while walking like this, who is to blame? If a driver causes an accident to avoid hitting a pedestrian who is violating traffic rules, then who is to be blamed? Therefore, to ensure the safety of pedestrians, drivers and pedestrians should abide by the rules, which will reduce accidents. However, speaking of rickshaw pullers and even chauffeurs, while many are careful, there are still quite a few who act recklessly, speeding ahead, disregarding the safety of pedestrians. Sometimes, cars are already close before the horn sounds, or several cars drive abreast, knocking people down without regard. As a result, passengers are in danger, pedestrians are in danger, and even drivers are not necessarily fortunate. In general, drivers who dare to charge recklessly must have something to rely on, either boldness, skill, the influence of the car owner, or disregard for the safety of human life. Therefore, when drivers are licensed, they should be tested on what they should abide by, what they should know, and what they should do, regardless of whether they are chauffeurs or rickshaw pullers. As for drivers who cause accidents, they should be severely punished so that they will be warned. It is often heard that buses and trams cause accidents; tram accidents are often caused by starting the vehicle before passengers have finished getting on or off, resulting in tragic deaths under the wheels. The responsibility for this lies with the tram operators and cannot be excused. As for buses, there used to be good regulations: they stopped at every stop, and the driver opened the door and stood by the vehicle to allow passengers to get on and off, then closed the door, rang the bell, and drove off, while also maintaining order. However, over time, this has become lax and is rarely seen anymore. It is a pity that discipline is difficult to cultivate but easy to destroy.

The population in the Settlement is growing daily, and transportation is becoming more advanced and complex. Due to the popularity of telephone delivery by shops and under special circumstances, bicycles have become tools for transporting long-distance goods. As a result, bicycles are very popular, flying back and forth like shuttles. This also increases the risk of accidents, as drivers often try to speed quickly, relying on the lightness of their vehicles, and often dart between other vehicles. Some are knocked down, and others are unable to brake and flip over with the vehicle. In addition, the congestion of various trucks on the roads, such as the mixed traffic on Beijing Road, and the loads that far exceed the width of the vehicle, staggering on the roads, will all cause unsafe conditions if there is no way to regulate them. As for parking locations, on roads with heavy pedestrian and vehicle traffic, parking on the side of the road should be prohibited. Even in quieter areas, parking should not obstruct traffic. However, this is not always the case. Parked cars do not cause accidents, but they narrow the road and indirectly increase the chance of accidents. It is the responsibility of the police to strictly enforce regulations.

The biggest purpose of the safety campaign is to ensure the safety of vehicles and pedestrians. Drivers who know the importance of human life will never be careless, because who doesn't have family members and friends? If their family members and friends were injured or killed by a vehicle, how would they feel? So, those who cause injury or death to others cannot be free from guilt and should think about preventing accidents in advance. Pedestrians should not save a few seconds, risking their lives by rushing across the road, forgetting the value of their bodies and the pain of injury or death. If the vehicle is caught by surprise and cannot yield, then the fault does not lie with the vehicle. Therefore, the target of the safety campaign is not limited to drivers but is the entire city's population. If all citizens pay attention to this campaign, then the campaign will have a great effect.

### Yunnan-Burma Road Repeatedly Attacked by Air, Transport at Highest Frequency, Japanese Planes Bomb Kunming Yesterday

Kunming: Although the Burma Road is often bombed by Japanese planes, and was attacked again this morning, the frequency of transport is still at its highest level.

Indian drivers can now be seen everywhere in Kunming, looking at the unfamiliar Chinese scenery with interest. At around 8:00 AM this morning, several Japanese light bombers appeared over Kunming and circled over the suburbs for an hour. Despite heavy fire from anti-aircraft guns, they still dropped bombs on various roads and strafed with machine guns, and many bombs fell. However, no damage has been reported. The air raid alert was lifted at 1:00 PM, with the raid lasting a total of five hours. At that time, it was raining heavily, and the residents who took refuge in the surrounding countryside suffered greatly. (Reuters, 15th)

### Murder of American Missionaries in Zhanyi

Kunming: According to recent news, the American missionaries Mr. and Mrs. Paham and their son, who were killed in Zhanyi on November 5, were killed by bandits.

The first bullet killed Mrs. Paham, and her son, who looked out the window, was also shot and killed. Mr. Paham was subsequently killed. After the shooting, the bandits entered the building, looted it, and left. Another son was injured, but his life is not in danger. The other four children, who were sleeping in another room, were safe and sound. The Yunnan Provincial Government and local authorities, at the request of the American consul, have agreed to make every effort to arrest the murderers and have sent troops to search for the bandits.

### Anti-French Sentiment Strong in Thailand, Vietnam Remains Vigilant, Taking Various Measures to Deal with Contingencies, Border Disputes Only Local in Nature

Hanoi: Regarding the situation between France and Thailand, officials here recently said that there have been no developments in the relationship between the two sides. Although the situation is slightly tense, the Vietnamese authorities remain actively vigilant and have taken various measures to deal with various contingencies. The border area is as peaceful as ever. The people of Cambodia and Laos recently held demonstrations expressing their loyalty and trust in France. As for the negotiations, the Thai government requested Vietnam in September of this year to cede the area on the right bank of the Mekong River in Laos to Thailand. In order to maintain the integrity of Vietnamese territory, the French government immediately refused and requested Thailand to exchange ratification documents for the non-aggression treaty signed in Bangkok on June 13 of this year. By the end of September, the Thai government had brought up the matter again, and the French government maintained its original position. Thai newspapers then engaged in a fierce anti-French campaign, and the Thai authorities sent troops to the southern border, causing repeated disputes at the border between Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand. However, these were all local in nature and have not been expanded. (Havas Dispatch, 14th)

### Greek Forces Successfully Counterattack: Advancing in Three Routes towards Albanian Territory: Border Strongholds Fall into Greek Hands: Key Town of Korçë Surrounded

Athens: The Greek General Headquarters announced that there was infantry, artillery, and air force activity on all fronts. Greek forces launched successive counterattacks last night, resulting in general progress in three areas of the front lines. Three local attacks by Italian forces were repelled. In the air battles yesterday and last night, a total of eleven Italian aircraft were shot down, and ten more were heavily damaged and beyond repair. Greek forces captured over 200 people yesterday, as well as countless military supplies. The Greek Air Force bombed Italian airfields in Korçë and Argirocastro, destroying several Italian aircraft on the ground. Advancing Italian troops were also attacked by Greek aircraft. One Greek aircraft did not return to base. (Reuters Dispatch, 15th)

Athens: Today's front-line report stated that Greek forces on the 100-mile front along the Greek-Albanian border launched a large-scale general offensive this morning. Five-sixths of the entire front have advanced into Albanian territory. Only the Italian forces in the Kalama River area of Epirus are still holding their ground, facing the imminent danger of being surrounded. The battles in other areas have shifted into Albanian territory since the Greek forces began their fierce attack at dawn yesterday. Italian soldiers' bodies were strewn all over the mountains. The key town of Korçë has almost been completely surrounded, with only a small exit path in the northwest corner remaining open. British aircraft flew over Italian bases and carried out large-scale bombings to assist the Greek offensive. Several Italian aircraft were shot down. Simultaneously, the British bomber planes attacked some non-military areas inland; Larissa was among them. It is said that the bomber planes bombed foreign ships docking in Thessaloniki last night, but without success. It was revealed here today that the only remaining landing dock in the vital port of Vlorë has been bombed by the Central Powers' aircraft. Durazzo was also bombed, and several fires broke out. Italian troops appear to be retreating towards Santi Quaranta. Greek mechanized units are using captured Italian vehicles and tanks with the same skill as their own. It is known that the Italian forces in the Western Epirus region are currently collapsing, abandoning their supplies along the way. (International Dispatch, 15th)

Athens: News from last night: Greek forces in the three sectors of the Greek-Italian front launched successive counterattacks, all of which made progress. Italian forces attacking in three locations have been repelled. Italian and Greek aircraft also engaged in aerial combat. Ten Italian aircraft were shot down, and the Greeks also lost three. It is heard that the Greek mountain troops approaching Korçë, the base of the Italian forces in the northern region, have surrounded the city, with only a small gap in the northwest corner awaiting closure. Greek forces in the southern region have crossed the Kalama River, forcing the Italian forces to retreat towards the Albanian border. Greek forces in the central region (Pindus region) continued to gain victories and have now retaken the positions they held on the first day of the war. The Greek forces are completing the mopping up of the remnants of the Italian Alpine 3rd Division, which collapsed in the Pindus Mountains last week. Larissa in eastern Greece was heavily bombed yesterday, resulting in many casualties. (Reuters Dispatch, 15th)

Budapest: A Greek radio station reported that Greek forces in the Pindus Mountains are continuing to pursue the rearguard of the Italian forces and crossed into Albanian territory yesterday. Italian positions there were also occupied by Greek troops. All the important locations along the Greek-Albanian border are now in Greek hands. The Greek side claims that the battle of the Pindus Mountains has fundamentally overturned the Italian invasion of Greece. (Associated Press Dispatch, 15th)

British and Greek Air Forces Assist in the Battle, Shooting Down Multiple Italian Aircraft

Athens: According to news from the front lines last night, while the advancing Greek troops were capturing many Italian soldiers in various places, the British and Greek air forces also fought fiercely in the skies over the Greek front lines against large groups of Italian aircraft attempting to protect the disorganized Italian forces and hinder the Greek advance into Albania. As a result, more than a dozen Italian aircraft were shot down again. According to the Greek High Command last night, there were intense artillery, infantry, and air battles on the entire front yesterday. The Greek forces have captured over 200 more Italian soldiers, and many war trophies have been captured. The Greek Air Force bombed the Italian airfields in Korçë and Argirocastro, destroying some Italian aircraft on the ground. It is heard that some parts of the far left flank of the Italian forces have withdrawn from the Kalama River. British and Greek bomber planes carried out a fierce bombing and strafing with machine guns on a convoy of Italian vehicles, numbering 400 in total, yesterday, thwarting the Italian attempt to reinforce the Italian forces in Karpathos. Greek heavy artillery also bombarded the highway between Korçë and Korçë yesterday to prevent the Italian forces from reinforcing via that road. (Associated Press Dispatch, 15th)

Italian Forces Forced to Retreat, Abandoning Mountain Fortresses

Athens: It is heard that the Greek forces, assisted by mountain artillery and tanks and supported by the British and Greek air forces, have advanced fiercely from the 120-mile front. In the Karpathos region, which forms the gateway to Ioannina, it is heard that the Italian forces have been forced to withdraw from the first line of defense, and the Greek cavalry is pursuing them. The Italian forces abandoned a large amount of baggage and fled. There were also fierce battles between Mount Musaki and the Yugoslav border. According to the latest news, the Italian forces were driven back to the 4,500-foot-high mountain fortress three hours after the Greek forces launched their attack. (Associated Press Dispatch, 15th)

### Romanian Petroleum Supplies Italy's War Effort: Agreement Reached in Principle: Italian Prime Minister and Romanian Premier Hold Talks

Rome: Regarding the supply of Romanian petroleum to the Italian war machine in Greece, it is believed that an agreement in principle was reached yesterday during the meeting between Antonescu and Mussolini. The Romanian Prime Minister and Minister of War, General Antonescu, met with Prime Minister Mussolini at the Palazzo Venezia for one hour and twenty-five minutes. General Antonescu, accompanied by the Romanian Foreign Minister Stercea, was warmly welcomed upon his arrival in Rome. After having lunch with the Italian King, they immediately began negotiations. In addition to the rumored petroleum agreement, other economic terms are also said to have been drafted, some of which are said to increase Romania's agricultural and mineral production, with emphasis on the production of copper and iron. It is believed here that the development of the Axis-led European petroleum group has gradually taken shape due to General Antonescu's visit to Rome and Foreign Minister Molotov's invitation to Berlin. It is widely believed that Italy's major petroleum purchases are from Romania, while Germany's major oil purchases are from the Soviet Union. It is heard that the exchange of business delegations between Italy and Romania was also discussed. The general impression here is that General Antonescu's visit to Rome is mainly for economic purposes and aims to improve the winter situation during the war. (Associated Press Dispatch, 15th)

Rome: According to a communique, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Romanian Prime Minister General Antonescu met for one and a half hours. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Romanian Foreign Minister Sturdza were also present. Prior to the meeting at the Palazzo Venezia, Antonescu met with Ciano at the Palazzo Chigi, attended by the Romanian Ambassador to Italy and the Italian Ambassador to Romania. As Romanian dignitaries drove through the city, the crowds cheered enthusiastically. Ciano and his wife hosted a banquet last night to entertain the Romanian guests, and Italian officials were invited to accompany them. (Haitong Press, 15th)

### Egyptian Prime Minister Dies Suddenly While Announcing Policy in Parliament: Cabinet Submits Resignation: Cairo in Turmoil and Unease

Beirut: Egyptian Prime Minister Sabri collapsed suddenly in parliament yesterday while delivering a speech before the royal family and the entire cabinet. He was helped up by several members of parliament and immediately sent to the hospital, but he died. The queen and queen mother witnessed the tragic scene and were in tears. The speech was continued and completed by the Speaker of the Senate. (Haitong Dispatch, 15th)

Milan: According to reports here today, after the death of Egyptian Prime Minister Sabri, the Egyptian cabinet has resigned. It is expected that a new cabinet will be formed within a few days. The funeral of the late Egyptian Prime Minister is scheduled to be held today. (Haitong Press, 15th)

Athens: News received here from Cairo regarding the sudden death of Egyptian Prime Minister Sabri yesterday revealed that Sabri had prepared a comprehensive report on Egypt's future policy. Egyptian political circles said that the Prime Minister's position was still to do his best to keep Egypt from participating in the war and that he wanted to ask parliament to pass a motion for Egypt to maintain peace. Upon hearing this, the situation in Egyptian political circles suddenly became tense. Sabri's death has caused great unease among the Egyptian people. Attempts by the public to hold demonstrations have been stopped by British forces. There are rumors that Sabri's death was an assassination, and the authorities are investigating. The Egyptian king's speech at the opening of parliament yesterday took a reserved attitude towards Britain in political terms, leading people to believe that the proposals drafted by Sabri had been approved by the Egyptian king. In view of this recent incident, it is generally believed that the situation in Egypt last night was extremely serious. (Haitong Dispatch, 15th)

### Berlin Declares: Germany and Soviet Union Reach New Agreement: Molotov Left German Territory the Night Before Last: Rumor that Soviet Union Made Demands on Turkey

Berlin: According to well-informed sources in Berlin, the talks between Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and German Führer Hitler were in complete agreement regarding the current and future relations between the two countries. All issues were thoroughly discussed in a friendly spirit, and an agreement has been reached, but its contents are yet to be announced. (Haitong Press, 15th)

Berlin: At 12 o'clock last night, Molotov's special train arrived at the Markinya station on the German-Soviet border. German escort officials, such as Intelligence Director Dornberg, got off the train to say goodbye, and the special train then entered Soviet territory. The German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Graf von der Schulenburg, traveled to the Soviet Union with Molotov. (Haitong Press, 15th)

Berlin: German newspapers commented on the conclusion of the German-Soviet talks, believing that Germany and the Soviet Union were in complete agreement on various important issues, proving that the policy of German-Soviet understanding was not only completely successful but would also continue to develop on the basis of close and permanent cooperation. The "People's Observer" stated that the Treaty of Non-Aggression of 1939 has provided a path for the national problems of Germany and the Soviet Union to be resolved. This treaty has also enabled the two countries to find vast economic spheres, and the amount of goods exchanged has been increasing, proving that both countries have the determination to continue this economic development. Molotov's visit has increased the friendly relations between Germany and the Soviet Union. After his meetings with Hitler and Ribbentrop, he has completely understood the common problems between the two countries. The "German General News" stated that German-Soviet proximity is based on the continental position of Greater Germany in 1940. The German-Soviet border is at peace. The common problems between the two countries include the stability of Eastern Europe, economic cooperation, and the overall political situation. Germany and Italy are fighting shoulder to shoulder against Britain, and the Soviet Union stands firmly beside them. After Germany and Italy signed the Tripartite Pact with Japan, Germany and the Soviet Union should exchange opinions. Hitler's and Stalin's policies of calm realization have achieved mutual understanding on various important issues. (Haitong Press, 15th)

Berlin: Semi-official German sources said that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has departed for Moscow, carrying a rumored new plan for German-Soviet consultation, which may recognize the Soviet Union's vast sphere of influence, including British India. Official reports said that as a result of Molotov's trip, Germany and the Soviet Union will conclude a new agreement on all important issues that affect both countries. According to well-informed sources, Stalin may endorse this new German-Soviet agreement. They also suggested that the Soviet Union may force Turkey to join the Axis powers, and Hitler, in return, will not interfere with the Soviet Union's actions to obtain a warm-water port in the Persian Gulf. (International Dispatch, 15th)

London: The Daily Herald today carried a message from Sweden stating that since Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Berlin, the Soviet Union is now demanding jurisdiction over Istanbul from Turkey, otherwise there will be a declaration of war on Turkey. (International News Agency Dispatch, 15th)

Stockholm: A Berlin dispatch in a Swedish newspaper stated that the results of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Berlin will not be announced for the time being. Molotov's current state of elation suggests that a general agreement may have been reached, and the Soviet Union's attitude towards Britain has also been determined. Soviet circles in Berlin now believe that coordination between Britain and the Soviet Union is almost impossible, but they believe that the Soviet Union will not join the Tripartite Pact at this time. The Soviet Union is very willing to see more capitalist countries drawn into the vortex, but it wants to stay out of it itself. Soviet sources also believe that what Germany is trying to do is to make the Soviet Union a source of supply to offset the United States' supply of raw materials to Britain. (Reuters Dispatch, 15th)

The Berlin Talks Result in Increased Understanding Between the Soviet Union and Germany

Moscow: Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov stayed in Berlin for two days on November 12 and 13 and held talks with Hitler and the German Foreign Minister. The two sides exchanged views in an atmosphere of mutual trust. As a result, the two sides have reached a mutual understanding on the most important issues related to the Soviet Union and Germany. While in Berlin, Molotov also met with General Göring and Hess, Hitler's representative of the National Socialist Party. Molotov left Berlin on the morning of the 14th to return to the Soviet Union. (TASS Dispatch, 15th)

Moscow: On the morning of the 14th, Molotov left Berlin to return to Moscow. In addition to accompanying staff, such as the Chairman of the Committee of the Metallurgical Industry, Tevosyan, German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Schulenburg and Soviet Ambassador to Germany Shafazhiv were also on board. At 10:30 a.m., German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop accompanied Molotov by car to the train station. Soviet and German flags were crossed at the entrance to the station. Molotov and Ribbentrop inspected the guard of honor lined up at the station. The German farewell party included Dr. Lama, Police Chief Himmler, and German labor leader Dr. Lee. In addition, all the staff of the Soviet Embassy in Germany also arrived at the station to say goodbye. Molotov warmly said goodbye to them and thanked Ribbentrop. After Molotov shook hands and said goodbye to the German representatives, he left Berlin for Moscow at 11:00 a.m. (TASS Dispatch, 15th)

Turkey Remains Calm and Draws Closer to Britain

Madrid: A Berlin dispatch in a Spanish newspaper stated that the talks between Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Hitler may have a significant impact on the Turkish government, but Turkey does not appear to be panicked and is becoming closer to Britain. The Turkish Embassy in Germany is now handling matters with skill and calmness. General opinion in Spain believes that the German-Soviet talks have two purposes: first, Germany hopes to induce the Soviet Union to exert sufficient pressure on Turkey, so that Germany can act more freely in the Balkan Peninsula; and second, Germany wants to make the Soviet Union join the "two-continent bloc." (Reuters Dispatch, 15th)

Istanbul: According to reports in local newspapers, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Berlin with a large number of attendants makes it clear that the topic of discussion will not be limited to economic matters. Although the content of the talks is still unknown, there is no doubt that the Soviet Union has little desire to participate in the war against the Axis countries and does not want to oppose any actions of the Axis countries. The newspaper pointed out that the presence of German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen in Berlin at the same time as Molotov is particularly noteworthy. Papen recently attended a meeting of the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy. (Haitong Dispatch, 15th)

Istanbul: Turkish newspapers have all published editorials reviewing Molotov's visit, believing that the illusion of a German-Soviet estrangement has been shattered. German-Soviet relations cannot be changed under any circumstances. (Haitong Dispatch, 15th)

### Germany and Italy Delineate Spheres of Influence in Europe, Using the Alps as the Boundary

Berlin: The German Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, the magazine "Berlin Rome Tokyo," published an article entitled "Leadership and Unity of Europe," stating that the Axis countries recognize the Alps as the natural boundary between Northern and Southern Europe and have decided that Germany will lead Northern Europe and Italy will lead Southern Europe. Spain will also participate in the implementation and defense of the plan for a new European order. The position of France in the new order will also be considered. France must prove its desire to participate in the new European order and its determination to defend this new order with facts. The development of Africa is also an important issue for Europe and will help Europe's independence. All small European countries want European countries to unite and accept strong leadership. Most of the important issues in Central Europe and the Danube region have already been resolved. The Balkan issue is also showing signs of resolution. Germany and Italy both understand their shared responsibility for the Balkan Peninsula and are cooperating to resolve various issues. Britain and France occupy vast colonies and have failed to develop them effectively. Germany and Italy will develop Africa based on the principles of National Socialism and Fascism, so that Europe will not depend on the supply of other continents. National institutions that can be preserved will not be destroyed. Excellent colonial achievements do not need to be respected, but the legitimate needs of all countries will be considered and adjusted. (Haitong Dispatch, 15th)

### German Nationals in Romania Granted Autonomy

Capital of Southern Country: An order issued in Bucharest yesterday, containing five points, virtually grants independent sovereignty to Romanian nationals of German descent. The five points are as follows: (1) Implementation of the Nuremberg anti-Jewish laws; (2) Recognition of the German flag as the symbol of the German national creed, with the same status as the Romanian flag, the symbol of the Romanian creed; (3) The Nazi Party is a protected legal entity; (4) Membership in the Nazi Party is limited to those who recognize themselves as German and are recognized by their leader; (5) The Nazi Party leader may issue regulations regarding German autonomy after approval by the Romanian government.

### Six Million Citizens of French Lorraine Forced to Migrate: First Result of Franco-German Cooperation Arouses Painful Impression on Vichy Government

Vichy: The French government issued a public statement today stating, "The German military authorities in our northeastern province of Lorraine have ordered residents of French descent in the province to choose between migrating to Poland or our free zone. Our compatriots have all chosen to migrate to the free zone. Since the 11th of this month, the German authorities have implemented forced migration, with five to seven trains per day. Unofficial German sources have informed them that the German authorities are taking this measure in accordance with the agreement established by the French and German governments. This statement is absolutely not accurate. The recent negotiations between France and Germany have never involved this issue. The French government has notified the German delegation of the Armistice Implementation Committee of this matter." (Havas Dispatch, 14th)

Surix: A "Lausanne Daily" correspondent in Vichy reported that a total of 60,000 French-speaking people in Lorraine, forced to leave the country by the Germans, must leave their homes after receiving short notice, forcing them to abandon all property and funds exceeding 2,000 francs. When Hitler met with Pétain recently, he offered his "loyal cooperation." The first result of this cooperation has aroused a "painful impression" in Vichy. (Reuters Dispatch, 15th)

### The Tragic History of the European War (3) - Three Protagonists in the French Tragedy (1) - Daladier: Outwardly Strong but Inwardly Weak

Now, let me introduce Daladier during the war to the readers. It was Monday afternoon, October 16th, at the French Embassy in Brussels. By this time, the European war had been going on for six months. Daladier held all the power in his hands, displaying a dictatorial style. He held three important positions and all cabinet members obeyed his orders. My visit to Brussels was to complete what I considered a very important mission. Looking back on the past now, I feel that that matter was even more important than I felt at the time. If Daladier had acted properly based on the results I had obtained, then in May 1940, the German army would not have been able to launch a fierce attack on Belgium and the Netherlands, causing disaster for France and Western Europe. I did not inform the French ambassador to Belgium about my activities in Europe, but he knew that he would be able to assist me if necessary.

I said, "Please connect me to Paris as soon as possible."

The Ambassador to Belgium said, "Alright, I will connect you. Who in Paris do you want to speak to?"

"Premier Daladier."

The ambassador was surprised and said, "Are you sure you haven't made a mistake? Can I really get him?"

Only then did I realize that, from the perspective of the Ambassador to Belgium at that time, Daladier was a mysterious figure who was not easily seen.

While we were waiting for the phone to connect, the ambassador warned me, "Please be careful when you speak. People often eavesdrop on phone lines. If you are not careful, the news will leak out and the consequences will be dire."

The phone rang, and I picked up the receiver.

"Hello, is that you, Giromand? Where are you now?"

"I am at the French Embassy in Brussels. I have a very important matter that needs to be discussed in person tomorrow. Please make time to see me."

"How about three o'clock?"

"I won't be able to leave on the express train until tomorrow morning. The time will definitely be late."

"Please wait a moment. Then how about five o'clock?"

"Very good. But can you guarantee to see me at five o'clock? Because, given the current situation, I must take the night train back to Brussels that evening."

"Okay, I will definitely try to arrange it."

On the train, I repeatedly thought about what I would say when I met Daladier. I wanted to get his final decision within five minutes. The energy I had spent fighting with the Belgian authorities for the past six days still felt abundant.

After the outbreak of the war, everyone who had been in contact with Daladier said, "Daladier has too many ideas and cannot make a decision on any matter. And it is getting harder and harder to talk to him. Even in a five-minute meeting, you will inevitably become confused, and he will become even more suspicious."

A few minutes after five o'clock, I was escorted to Daladier's office. I didn't even have time to exchange pleasantries or look at him. But I noticed that his face was red and his eyes were dull.

I said, "You must already know that I have just arrived here from Brussels. I have been working there continuously for six days—many things have been very difficult—now I want to tell you the results. In my opinion, it is extremely important, something we would not have dared to imagine a week ago." I spoke hastily and urgently, briefly mentioning the main points. I then continued, "But we must get this matter done as soon as possible. This is the plan that Mr. Spaak (the Belgian Foreign Minister) and I have agreed upon. Please write a letter to the King of Belgium and give it to me to take with me."

Daladier looked at me with a face full of doubt and said to me, "Write a letter to the King of Belgium?"

I replied, "Yes, Mr. Spaak and I have even agreed on the wording of the letter. We have already obtained the King of Belgium's permission; everything is ready. Tonight, I will return to Brussels and present this letter to the King tomorrow. His reply will be brought back by me. After that, their words will have guarantees."

Daladier's expression was truly incredible and almost callous. At first, he said some disappointing things, wanting to let me know that the results I mentioned above were not as important as I imagined—Daladier thought that this kind of result already existed—and it was very obvious.

I felt like I had been struck by lightning. No one but myself could understand the real situation at that time, and no one could appreciate the general attitude of the Belgian government before and after my six days of running around in Belgium. I knew too much about the various difficulties I had personally experienced, and I could still recall the scene when I spoke with Spaak. When Spaak spoke about Belgium's request for mechanical assistance from Britain and France in times of crisis, the fearful look on his face still lingered in my mind. Daladier's inhumanity was truly baffling to me. He did not say a word about my obtaining so much information and overcoming various difficulties in these six days, nor did he even ask a question. He had already indicated that he did not have time to listen to me. And what was even more embarrassing was that when I wanted to briefly explain the general situation in a few words, he always interrupted me and explained it first. I thought to myself, this was clearly his way of giving me proof, indicating that his news was more well-informed than mine and that he knew more than I did. I couldn't help but think of Meggison and Wilhelm II in my book "Men of Good Will."

But I will never be discouraged by these small details. I mustered up my courage again and said, "In any case, I must take the letter back to Brussels tonight."

Daladier replied, "It's too late tonight. Gamlin and I will be working together until midnight."

I said, "If you can agree, I will go to the next room and draft the letter. We have already agreed on the content. It will only take you five minutes to copy it by hand and sign it."

He shook his head and said, "No: First, because I cannot write directly to the King of Belgium."

"Why not?"

"Because I am not the head of state. Only President Lebrun can write this letter. Think about how troublesome this is."

"But Premier, I beg you! You must know that this is during wartime. Maybe next week Belgium and the Netherlands will be attacked. This is an important and urgent matter. If you still want to talk about red tape at this time, what other good strategies are there? And the King of Belgium has already approved this move! Who else but me would care about this?"

"Okay! Let me think about it for a while."

When he sent me to the door of his office, he was slow and hesitant, obviously showing some disgust. I thought it would be good to flatter him with a sentence, so I said, "The King of Belgium is still a young man and he praises you very highly."

"I know, I know," Daladier had already known about these things in his heart!

### Large-Scale Raids by German Aircraft - Industrial Centers in Central England - Long-Range Artillery Shells Exchange Across the Sea - Berlin Suffers Air Raids and Large Fires

London - Last night and this morning, large groups of German aircraft furiously bombed industrial centers in the Midlands, Liverpool, and South Wales, with unprecedented intensity. During the day, German aircraft fiercely attacked London, failing repeatedly. A total of nineteen German aircraft were shot down. In the evening, Germany continued to send large groups of fighters, escorts, and bombers to fiercely attack the industrial centers in central England. During the air raids on London last night, although the anti-aircraft fire protecting the city center was effective, many explosions occurred in the suburbs. Two hospitals were destroyed. The most heavily bombed areas were Sheffield, Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Wolverhampton, Huddersfield, and Worcester. Also, according to reports, a large hotel in a town in the northwest, with extremely weak air defenses, was attacked at dusk, and many houses and factories were destroyed. Furthermore, it is reported that a large hotel in the Midlands was destroyed. Excavating the ruins revealed that many people were crushed to death. (International Telegram, 15th)

London - The Ministry of Aviation announced that German aircraft attacked England yesterday, but were shot down on the southeast coast of England before they could drop their bombs. Nineteen aircraft were destroyed, including thirteen dive bombers and one fighter. Yesterday morning, an enemy heavy bomber crossed the coast and was quickly shot down. It has now been confirmed that two enemy bombers were destroyed on Wednesday night. The British also lost one fighter, but both pilots were unharmed. Most of the German aircraft lost yesterday were shot down by a squadron of British Spitfire fighters. The pilots of this squadron set a new personal record yesterday, shooting down three enemy aircraft each. The twelve Spitfires of the squadron shot down a total of thirteen Junkers enemy bombers. More than forty Junkers 87 dive bombers, in various formations, flew towards Dover at an altitude of 14,000 feet, while the defending Messerschmitt 109 fighters were in teams at an altitude of 18,000 feet, appearing and disappearing in the clouds. However, twenty British Spitfires flew even higher, swooped down to attack fiercely, and dispersed the enemy aircraft. A certain Air Force Lieutenant leading the British aircraft squadron shot at a Junkers enemy aircraft, causing it to flip over and fall. He then destroyed another Messerschmitt enemy aircraft and hit another Junkers enemy aircraft, which caught fire and fell. Another British pilot continuously attacked four Junkers aircraft and saw two of them smoking and falling. (Reuters, 15th)

Berlin - Last night and early this morning, British bombers carried out the most intense air raids on the German capital since the beginning of the war, amidst the incessant firing of German anti-aircraft guns. An apartment building was directly hit and completely destroyed. Fires broke out in several areas. Two British aircraft exploded and fell over Berlin, causing large fires. However, German officials said that the fires did not cause any damage. Several hours before the raids, the German anti-aircraft fire was denser than ever before, and the shells formed a network of fire. The sound that was produced merged into one, making it impossible to hear individual gunshots. The entire sky was a network of fire formed by anti-aircraft shells, which continued incessantly for a long time. The subways, buses, and trams were also extremely crowded, and the theater audiences could not leave due to the air raids. Countless houses were destroyed. However, the German high command said that such losses were insignificant. Well-informed sources said that four people were killed and one was injured in the air raids. (Associated Press, 15th)

London - On Thursday night, the British Air Force heavily bombed Berlin and attacked airfields, harbors, and ships in German-occupied areas from Stavanger in Norway to Lorient in Brittany. Ten British aircraft did not return. According to an Air Ministry communique, the weather was good and the moonlight was bright when the British aircraft bombed Berlin. Several high-explosive bombs were dropped on the Silesian Station and freight yard, and on the parking lots of other stations. The Anhalter Station and Templehof Airfield in central Berlin were also bombed and large fires broke out. (Reuters, 15th)

London - This morning, residents of the Channel ports were awakened by the roar of British and German long-range guns. The shelling lasted for two hours and was started by the Germans, who fired several shells before dawn. There were no reports of casualties. Later, British guns opened fire on German gun positions, and the Germans returned fire. (Reuters, 15th)

London - Since German aircraft launched a blitzkrieg against England, last night was the first time they concentrated their efforts on attacking the Midlands. After a town in the Midlands was heavily bombed, fires broke out in many places, causing considerable damage. Detailed reports are still not available, but the Ministry of Aviation said that the casualties are likely to be high. Other towns in the Midlands that were attacked suffered damage to shops and houses. Although there must have been some people killed or injured, the number was not large. Enemy aircraft also invaded the London area from time to time, dropping bombs, destroying several houses, and killing or injuring some people. Bombs also fell on some areas broadcasting to England and North Wales, but there were few casualties. (Reuters, 15th)

### British Naval Air Arm Attacks Taranto Again - Aerial Torpedo Attacks Effective - Situation in the Mediterranean Has Changed

London - After the British Naval Air Arm's surprise attack on the Italian naval base of Taranto in southern Italy on Tuesday, which damaged three Italian battleships and achieved astonishing results, British Air Force bombers attacked Taranto again on Wednesday. Although the details are not yet known, well-informed sources in London have learned that this attack was also very successful. When the British aircraft attacked on Wednesday, flying over the Gulf of Taranto, the moonlight was bright and clear, and the warships in the harbor could be clearly seen. The anti-aircraft batteries on the ships and on the ground fired intensely, but the British aircraft's bombs still hit their targets. Several high-explosive and incendiary bombs hit the main docks in the eastern part of the inner harbor. At one point, seven large fires were burning simultaneously, accompanied by continuous and violent explosions. As one of the British aircraft was returning, fifteen minutes after leaving the port of Taranto, it looked back at the port and saw the white light caused by another explosion, illuminating Taranto as if it were daytime. Naval oil tanks and destroyers in the docks also caught fire. (Reuters, 15th)

London - A Naval Ministry communique stated that British naval fighters have been quite successful in recent operations in the Mediterranean, destroying at least three enemy aircraft. Several others were also damaged. The British aircraft suffered no losses. On November 8, an Italian aircraft engaged in a "surveillance" mission was hit, damaged, and crashed into the sea. Also, a team of seven enemy aircraft approached the British fleet and was driven back. One of them was shot down. On November 9, British aircraft destroyed another enemy aircraft. The next day, one enemy aircraft was destroyed and another was damaged. Enemy bombs fell near the British fleet, but the ships suffered no damage and the crew suffered no casualties. (Reuters, 15th)

Alexandria - According to the Reuters correspondent in the Mediterranean fleet, I have just returned here after sailing with the warships for seven days, covering more than 3,500 miles. During this period, the Mediterranean Fleet carried out cover operations, enabling the Naval Air Arm to inflict fatal blows on the Italian ships in Taranto. British light warships attacked Italian and Albanian traffic and escorted convoys transporting soldiers and weapons to Greece. This cover operation was not only extremely effective, but the cruising fighters of the Naval Air Arm also shot down six Italian fighters and two bombers. (Reuters, 15th)

London - A Reuters military correspondent has learned from naval sources the first detailed account of the battle of Taranto and the implementation of the plan that had been prepared for several weeks. The British aircraft carriers HMS Eagle and HMS Illustrious sailed to the entrance of the Gulf of Taranto in the dark of night, and then the torpedo bombers were hoisted to the flight deck and everything was arranged for a brave and unprecedented attack. In order to catch the Italians off guard and to strike their targets simultaneously with as many aircraft as possible to achieve maximum effect, the British aircraft had to continuously rise from the deck to form formations of at least six aircraft in each team. When they returned after the attack, the aircraft had to regroup and find their base and land on the deck. All of this had to be done in the dark without letting the enemy know the location of the aircraft carriers. This could not be done without highly trained pilots with great skill. The nature of the damage suffered by the enemy ships showed that the lethal weapons used by the British aircraft were torpedoes, as the damaged areas of the enemy ships were below the waterline, where the armor was thinner. The British aircraft dived down from high altitude and released torpedoes at the lower layers of the Italian battleships from a height of fifty to one hundred feet above the water. All but two British aircraft flew back to the aircraft carriers. The pilots were greatly excited about the success of this first aerial torpedo attack. (Reuters, 15th)

### Hitler Receives Labor Representatives - Praises the Achievements of Armament Factory Workers

Berlin - Hitler today received eighty-five German male workers and forty female worker representatives from various places who had been awarded the Iron Cross. Information Director Dietrich and several important officials accompanied the reception. Hitler pointed out that capitalist Britain was in a position of antagonism with socialism and therefore declared war on Germany. This time, it is not only the soldiers who are contributing to the country, but also the large number of workers in German armament factories who are working hard for the country, which can be said to be the same as the soldiers who are fighting shoulder to shoulder. Because the workers in the armament factories can provide the soldiers with the best military equipment, reducing the soldiers' sacrifices, and they can complete the best weapons at the lowest cost, saving the country's expenses. Their contribution is truly indelible. The German people are the foundation of today's Germany. With sincere unity and united will, we will be able to persevere to the end and achieve victory. At that time, Germany will be the most advanced socialist country in the world. (Haitong News Agency, 15th)

### Fujian Provincial Education Director Zheng Zhenwen Publishes - Recent Educational Status in Fujian Province (Part 2)

National Education

The province's primary education was actively promoted last year and the year before according to the pre-war plans. Since the Central Government promulgated the outline of organizational at all levels of counties and its implementation methods last winter, the province has first transformed ordinary primary schools and wartime national schools into central primary schools or national schools and implemented national schools. In February of this year, a general order was issued to all counties to begin the transformation, and key points for the transformation were formulated and issued for implementation. The province originally planned to have all 120,000 school-age children, 496,000 out-of-school children, and 40,000 men and women adults enroll within five years and be forced to enroll by counties in phases. We are now looking at the number of schools established reported by various counties recently, the province has established a total of 1,087 central schools. The original plan was to establish 1,000 schools this year, exceeding the target by 87 schools. There are a total of 3,899 national schools. The reason for this difference is that the budget for this year was finalized a little later, which caused the schools not to be established when the spring semester started. However, some counties have made up for the establishment when the fall semester started, but have not reported it yet, so it has not been included in the calculation. As for the implementation plan for the 30th year, it has been decided to first complete one central school per township and town. If the number of national schools in the county has exceeded one school for every three baos, it will be temporarily set up. If it has not reached one school for every three baos, it should complete one school for every three baos, which requires the addition of 434 central schools and 127 national schools, so that the province reaches 1,430 central schools and 4,394 national schools. What is particularly noteworthy is that the facilities for national education in the future will pay more attention to the even distribution of schools in terms of location, population, and schools.

Social Education

Since this year, the province has incorporated remedial education for out-of-school adults and women into the unified implementation of national education. Recently, the Ministry of Education has paid great attention to national sports, library education, drama, music, and electrical education. In accordance with this intention, the province has issued a general order to all counties to establish sports fields and libraries everywhere. In the Fujian Provincial Education Five-Year Plan, the first phase (i.e., from the 29th to the 30th year) is also drafted, requiring each county to establish a library and a sports field. The second phase (i.e., from the 31st to the 32nd year) requires each district to establish a library and a sports field. The third phase (i.e., the 33rd year) requires each township and town to establish a library and a sports field. The Education Department also organized a mobile teaching group for mass education, using educational tools such as drama, singing, and film to carry out mobile teaching so that education can penetrate into the people. In addition, it also planned to organize war paintings and wartime cultural exhibitions to enhance the people's combat morale and instill modern knowledge, especially to promote social culture.

The above is only the main point. In short, after the war, Fujian's education can show several progressive trends.

(1) Educational facilities are changing from consumption to production. In the past, education in our country was somewhat consumption-oriented. The needs of society for learning not to be used and the facilities of education were two separate things, which resulted in people not being able to give full play to their talents and education becoming a waste. The whole country was like this, and this province was no exception. For example, the establishment of medical schools and agricultural schools, the emphasis on industrial and scientific research in research institutes, and vocational schools were established according to the special products of each county or the original industries, respectively, or vocational supplementary schools. Middle schools and central schools, national schools also focused on production and labor training. In this way, people can have a specialty, and the industry can have special talents.

(2) The distribution of schools is changing from malformation to relationship. The establishment of schools is mostly biased towards coastal areas and cannot be developed evenly. After the war, with the development of inland transportation, schools have also been rationally allocated, and schools above the junior college level are no longer concentrated in one place as before. Secondary schools such as the establishment of normal school districts, middle school districts, and vocational school districts make the number of schools in each district uniform. National education also takes the bao as a unit, with one national school established in each bao and one central school established in each township. This shows that the province's education has the trend of expanding from points to areas.

(3) The target of education has changed from children to adults. In the past, education in this province was somewhat biased towards children, and little attention was paid to adults. After the war, students above the senior high school level were mobilized to participate in civil training and civil education work, in order to stimulate the people's national consciousness and combat morale. After the establishment of the national education system this year, children's education and adult education are given equal importance, becoming a kind of education for all people. At the recent third meeting of the National Education Committee, a proposal to accelerate the promotion of adult education was also passed, and a special plan was drawn up to implement it first in Yong'an County. In addition, mobilizing intellectuals to run civil education and normal school students to concurrently run social education are further manifestations of the province's recent emphasis on adult education.

The province's education has gradually been brought into the right track. I hope that colleagues in the education sector will continue to work hard to complete the great cause of building the country. (End)

### Over 30,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive Again: Rice Prices Surge Instead

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Guiyang ship arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, carrying 3,236 bags of foreign rice, which were unloaded at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. It was previously reported that the French company's Harding (transliteration) ship directly shipped more than 2,700 tons of foreign rice from Saigon. It is now known that the ship arrived in port yesterday afternoon and docked at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou, carrying 27,807 bags of foreign rice and only 760 bags of corn. Unloading began yesterday.

However, the price of foreign rice on the market yesterday fluctuated sharply and did not escape the scope of speculative manipulation. In the early market, the exchange rate was loose and flat, and transit rice poured in. Actual sales were consistently sluggish, and new hoarding was reluctant. The market still had the appearance of entering a smooth path. The selling prices of foreign rice all saw a small return of three to five corners. Unexpectedly, rumors resurfaced on the market in the afternoon, and large players inside and outside the industry became active again. The original packages of Yinghua Company's recycled rice were particularly noticed by buyers. The spot price of No. 2 Saigon was 79 yuan in the early market, and once rose to 82.5 yuan in the afternoon. The November price was 77.8 yuan to 78 yuan in the morning, and rose to 80 yuan in the afternoon. The December price was 75.5 yuan to 75.7 yuan in the morning, and rose to about 77 yuan in the afternoon. The market price rose by two or three yuan. The spot price once rose by one or two yuan in the afternoon. However, in the evening market, there were many profit-takers and large players returning, so the market fell by a small number of corners to one yuan. However, compared to the previous night, the spot price was still one yuan higher, and the original package price rose by one or two yuan. The total spot transaction volume for the day was seven or eight thousand bags, and the original package recycled goods were as high as seven or eight hundred tons.

The arrival of new japonica and tea-seed wild rice is still scarce, with only over a thousand dan arriving. The sales market is also keen to absorb them due to the surge in foreign rice, so the owners are unusually firm, and the prices continue to rise by one yuan. The opening price of new japonica original package was 92 yuan, and the final price was 87 yuan. The price per hu was 88.3 yuan to 86.5 yuan. The tea-seed original package was 89.5 yuan, and the price per hu was 86 yuan and 85.5 yuan. The wild rice was 92 yuan to 90 yuan, and the Dujian price per hu was 77 or 8 yuan.

The demand for glutinous rice is also strong, but the arrival is not large, so the market is also good. The opening price of Yili white was 83.4 yuan to 83 yuan, Changdan white was 81.5 yuan, Hong Kong white was 76 yuan to 74 yuan, and glutinous lu was 66 yuan to 62.4 yuan.

### Flour Trading Remains Quiet

Flour: Trading remained weak yesterday. The offer from the No. 2 flour mill was still 17 yuan, and the customer offer was 18.5 yuan, with no changes for the time being. On the local market, more than 8,000 bags were supplied by the Fu and Fu mills, which was enough for distribution. The asking price for recycled goods of the old brand was still 19 yuan, but because the price was high, buyers were not greedy. More than 30,000 bags of foreign flour have newly arrived, but have not yet been sold on the market, so the owners are unwilling to underestimate them, and the buying and selling is quite hesitant. It is said that the selling price of high-end foreign flour is hovering around the 19 yuan mark, with no fixed transaction.

Wheat: Trading remained hesitant yesterday. The source of supply from Kunshan and other places in the interior has not yet been smooth. The selling price of the goods stored in the concessions is 27 or 8 yuan. The sales of Chinese mills and exports are both sluggish. Regarding Japanese mills, it is said that the Sanxin mill has newly ordered a large batch of forward wheat, totaling more than 10,000 bags, and is not enthusiastic about taking small quantities. It is said that the price of goods sent to the mill is still only 21 yuan per original package.

Sugar Market

### Cube Sugar Continues to Loosen

The sugar market trend turned steady yesterday, and trading was more active. The association's quoted price for spot goods was 24 grade coarse white, foreign warehouse, TML mark, 73 yuan, old goods 72.8 yuan, Dutch raw sugar spot goods 56.4 yuan to 56.5 yuan, delivery on the 30th of this month 56.7 yuan to 56.5 yuan. Taikoo cube sugar all fell slightly, B mark, West warehouse 75.2 yuan, East warehouse 74.5 yuan, DY mark, West warehouse 69.5 yuan, HX mark 69.3 yuan, East warehouse 69 yuan, HM mark, West warehouse 66.3 yuan, H mark cube raw sugar 55 yuan, 400 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.

Seafood

### Dried Mussels from Siam Sold Open Yesterday

Dried mussels from Siam have been arriving successively. A batch was sold open yesterday, with large dried mussels at 198 yuan, medium dried mussels at 186 yuan, and small dried mussels at 178 yuan. The sales were still good, and the trend was stable.

Few Shrimp Tails Traded

Since the cheap sale of shrimp tails from the East, the trading of Western shrimp tails has been very quiet. Only a few shrimp tails from Lak have been sold, with a small amount. The price of the top goods was 285 yuan, and the final price was 245 yuan.

North and South Goods

### Golden Needles Vegetable Prices Reported to Rise

According to a letter from Xuzhou, due to the gradual scarcity of goods and the decline in quality, the prices of golden needles vegetables have risen by five or six yuan. For example, the cost of Suqian vegetables is already above the market price, but the sales in Shanghai are not very smooth, making it difficult to raise the price too high, forming a situation of inverted suspension.

Metals

### Copper and Tin Market Prices Firm: But Actual Sales Quite Sluggish

Purple copper and yellow copper mostly come from the United States and Japan. Although they are not affected by the European war, the transportation and insurance costs are very expensive. In addition, the situation in the Pacific has been tense recently, and the source of supply has also decreased. Therefore, the sentiment in Shanghai is quite good, and the market prices are unusually firm. However, due to the influence of high prices, most people dare not take action. In addition, there has been no movement from out-of-town merchants recently, and the absorption capacity has also decreased sharply. Currently, only local users and sporadic transactions can meet the market demand. Therefore, the market situation is not very lively, but the asking prices for each commodity are still high. For example, old TC purple copper ingots are sold for 560 yuan, purple copper plates are sold for 560 yuan, purple copper sheets (Nanchang factory) are sold for 530 yuan, No. 13 purple copper sheets are sold for 550 yuan, No. 16 purple copper wire is sold for 300 yuan, purple copper pipes are sold for 6 yuan per pound, coarse and fine yellow copper bars are sold for 150 yuan, yellow copper plates are sold for 435 yuan, yellow copper sheets (Nanchang factory) are sold for 430 yuan, No. 13 yellow copper sheets are sold for 430 yuan, No. 16 yellow copper wire is sold for 290 yuan, and yellow copper pipes are sold for 5 yuan per pound.

The largest sales outlet for tin is Shaoxing, because the production and sales of tin foil there are nationwide. However, due to the impact of the war, which hindered transportation, the tin foil market is sluggish, so the demand for small tin ingots is also not very high. However, the Shanghai market is unusually strong due to the lack of supply. The opening price is 1,500 yuan per dan. It is found that only forty or fifty dan were traded yesterday, mostly taken away by retail investors. In addition, the Dutch tin market has also been sluggish recently, and the number of merchants and banks on the local market is small. However, the overseas supply is weak, and the local inventory is limited, so the sentiment is good instead, and the opening price remains firm, with a selling price of 1,600 yuan per dan. Only a few dozen units were traded by shipyards and machinery factories. The merchants showed no movement. The sales of other types of tin, such as Jianghua tin and Hengdi tin, are not worth mentioning.

Finance

### Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand Balance Out

In the foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American exchange had entered a plateau, as the Bank of England and HSBC initially absorbed purchases, while Chinese merchants and speculators stopped and sold. Chinese banks had a good appetite for buying, leading the US dollar to briefly settle at 5.96875 yuan, before tightening sharply to 9.875 yuan. British gold also softened to 3 pence 75, but in the morning, Japanese and American banks had ample supply for sale. In the afternoon, telegrams came from Hong Kong to sell, which offset the buying appetite of speculators and Chinese banks, resulting in no backlash in trading. As a result, both British and American exchange rates closed without any change compared to the previous day.

The market softened immediately after opening, as Chinese merchants and speculators continued to sell. It was estimated that foreign banks had received the American exchange for this month at 5.96875 yuan, but Chinese banks were already interested in buying, and HSBC also came to buy, so the underlying trend returned to flat due to offsetting buying and selling. It was estimated that Chinese banks on the mainland received the American exchange from foreign banks for this month at 5.9375 yuan. HSBC's listed price was announced unchanged, and the silver balance tax was unchanged. At this time, speculators suddenly turned to buying, causing the price to soften again. It was estimated that American banks settled with the American exchange for this month at 5.9375 yuan to 9.0625 yuan, and when the softest was only 5.875 yuan, shillings also softened to 3 pence 75 for settlement. Later, relying on Japanese banks to sell, and at the same time exporters also had positions for sale, it was estimated that all American exchanges appeared at 5.9375 yuan. The market was quite quiet at noon. The closing price for spot American exchange was 5.9375 yuan, British gold was 3 pence 765625, the same as the morning opening for American, British tightened 0.015625.

### Gold Market Calm

Yesterday's gold futures market, both official and unofficial, saw mediocre ups and downs, closely following the exchange market with slight fluctuations. Although trading was brisk, speculators reduced their activity, perhaps because large players were watching and waiting for the situation with overseas cabinets to stabilize before taking action. The highest price yesterday was around 10:45 in the morning, reaching 5,695 yuan. The market was weaker later, constantly hovering below 5,650 yuan. As a result, the closing price was 5,650 yuan, down 18 yuan compared to the previous day. The premium for forward positions offered by buyers to sellers was initially 15 yuan, later 12 yuan. The cash price was 5 yuan lower than the forward price. The gold price for jewelry stores ultimately did not change, and Customs gold etc. remained flat.

Later, it was reported that the exchange rate had turned flat, and buyers gradually concentrated, briefly pushing the price up to 5,690 yuan. However, the rising trend was not strong, and before long, securities houses sold 20 taels to gold dealers, falling to 5,670 yuan. However, due to the sudden tightening of the exchange market, gold dealers and money changers entered the market to buy, pulling the price up again to the edge of the 5,700 yuan mark. It was estimated that silver shops bought 20 taels from gold dealers for 5,695 yuan. However, it was difficult to maintain the price, and with retail investors selling high, the price fell to a low of 5,645 yuan. The sentiment at noon was slightly stable, and it was estimated that silver shops bought 20 taels from securities houses for 5,660 yuan.

Securities

### Domestic Debt Results Still Rise: Some Foreign Stocks Soar

The securities unofficial market yesterday, the market went from soft to hovering. Traders on the floor shorted aggressively, rebounding slightly, and then collectively covering, with neither side having a clear grasp of the situation. Outsiders bought hundreds of thousands, so the market price wanted to fall but stopped. Tongkang had been cutting more for days, and Hongda and Defu all sold in large quantities, but the market price did not fall. Only the C-type transaction was particularly active, and almost no one consulted D-type, so its market price was particularly low. The difference between C and D was nearly two yuan. There must be a period of brewing to wait for the situation to clear up. Yesterday, the transaction for Shunchang bought hundreds of thousands, and the amount for 6th was also huge. As for Lianhe, Changfeng, Lianyi, Xiekang, Dafeng, and Xinchang, they either covered shorts or newly traded, also quite lively, but ultimately failed to raise the market price, because Tongkang initially dumped, followed by Tongkang, Dingkang, Hongda, and Defu selling.

Yarn and Cotton

### Speculative Thinking Changes: Yarn Market Continues Downstream

The yarn market, which was weak last night, continued to trend downward yesterday. This is because the environment is unfavorable, because the previous rising trend was dramatic, but failed to discover new peaks and retraced. Therefore, general speculators, in view of the current situation, are temporarily deeply afraid that the upstream market will be difficult to see, and this market situation has changed and inclined downstream, so although Hong Kong has nearly a thousand bales in actual sales, it has failed to raise morale. The fundamental problem is still thinking about consumption.

The morning opening of spot yarn, because the sentiment was weak in the afternoon of the previous day, everyone mostly held a realistic selling doctrine, so the market situation was relatively soft. The opening price of 20 count double horse was 1,235 yuan, down 5 yuan compared to the previous day. At this time, the trend on the market was even more chaotic, with shouting prices varying. Shortly after, it rose to 1,242 yuan, and then it was heard that the exchange rate opened flat, and the selling wind was flourishing, falling to 1,228 yuan. Shorts were able to cover favorably, and it rose again to 1,245 yuan, but ultimately, with morale not boosted, it fell again to close at 1,236.5 yuan. It is found that the transaction statistics for half a day were sixty zero twenty-five bales, and the market fell 4.5 yuan. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:

### Cotton Mills Need to Decline

The situation for spot cotton remains mediocre, because the market trend belongs to the downstream, and the factory's need is even more declining. However, Shanghua, Xinyu, and other factories still add to their purchases from time to time, but the amount is weak. The price of three-remainder cotton is 133 yuan, and the price of lower cotton is 232 yuan to 226 yuan.

In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market is firm, first due to the purchase of speculators, and then due to the good spot transactions, and the result of the same industry buying and rising. The closing price rose more than ten pounds in sound compared to the previous day. The forecast for India, including predictions, was not much different compared to the previous day.

Shanghai foreign cotton transactions have always been unusually quiet in recent days. The thinking of the same industry is especially fixed, because the inventory on the market is not abundant.

Piece Goods

### Cotton Market Remains Firm

Yesterday's cloth market initially declined slightly but quickly stabilized. With excessive speculative funds and fickle market sentiment, most traders and hoarders adopted a wait-and-see approach. However, many small retailers were inclined to sell. Small quantities of both coarse and fine cloth, as well as twill, dropped by 1 to 2.5 jiao per unit. Prices for bleached and dyed cloth varied, with a general decrease of about 2.5 jiao per unit. Velvet was selling briskly, with popular 13-pound brands rising by 2.5 to 5 jiao per unit. Slower-moving miscellaneous brands fell by 5 jiao to 1 yuan. Wholesale and retail transactions in local shops were robust, with over 500 pieces of various cloths being added. Guangdong and Hong Kong dealers supplied over a hundred pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and colored twill, while Fujian dealers supplied over a hundred pieces of melton, blue cloth, and other items.

The morning market for Eastern cloth remained weak, but due to absorption by local traders and good transactions with dyeing factories, prices rebounded. White cloth, a leading fine cloth, initially fell to 34.95 yuan in the morning but soon rose again, hovering around 35.34 yuan. The market outlook stabilized, with a closing price of 35.475 yuan. Those dealing in serge opened at 1.09 yuan.

### Fake Zhigong Melton Popular

Yesterday's melton cloth market remained active. Merchants from Nanjing and Suzhou continued to devise ways to transport and mix it with Guangdong goods, and single-batch traders were numerous. With the autumn sales season nearing its end, the main items traded in Shanghai were dark black, thick, high-quality flannels and overcoat cloths. Recently, due to various rumors, investors with available funds have been secretly seeking out and absorbing "Paris" cloth and cotton-woven "Yuan Qing" fake Zhigong melton. Its sales in the market have been quite brisk recently. Large and small shoe workshops in the city are stocking up on it in large quantities. Single-width cloth is wholesaled at 2.30 to 2.40 yuan per yard; "Great Enterprise Lion" brand at 2.15 yuan; and ordinary lower-grade goods at 1.90 yuan. Genuine wool Zhigong melton now costs at least 22 to 23 yuan per yard to cut and sell. To cater to the preferences of retail customers and boost sales, shoe workshops are mostly purchasing cotton-woven fake Zhigong melton. Ordinary pairs of fake Zhigong melton shoes sell for 3 to 4 yuan, while shoes made from genuine Zhigong melton must sell for 7 to 8 yuan. Therefore, the fake kind naturally sells better.

Coal

### Coal Dust Panic Alleviated - 4,500 Tons of Herling Dust Arrive

Due to the changing situation in Vietnam, shipments of Hongji white coal dust have been scarce for a long time, leading to the depletion of local stocks and soaring black market prices. However, high prices attracted expedited deliveries, and a large shipment of new goods is on its way. Yesterday, 4,500 tons of Herling white coal dust from Taiwan, handled by a certain firm, arrived and was unloaded at warehouses in Pudong. Although the list price has not been released, it is expected to be around 80 to 90 yuan per ton. The coal dust panic can now be temporarily alleviated.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Responds to Rice Evaluation Committee: Domestic Rice Should Have a Price Limit Set and Agrees to Assist in Investigating the Cost of Foreign Rice; Reasonable Profits to Be Determined by Rice Evaluation Committee; Indirect Restriction of Domestic Rice Prices Can Suppress Rising Prices of Foreign Rice

When the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee experienced high rice prices last month, it sent a letter to the Municipal Council requesting the establishment of a standard for evaluating rice prices, so that the Evaluation Committee could use this standard to evaluate prices. It is now known that the Municipal Council responded to this issue yesterday, its original letter stating: "According to the opinion of the Bureau's Supply Committee, the selling price of foreign rice should not exceed the actual cost required for continued procurement, plus a reasonable profit. The amount of profit that can be called reasonable should be determined by the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee. If it is necessary to consult with the Rice Merchants' Association, you can first consult with the association. The Supply Committee also believes that once the price of foreign rice has been evaluated, the reasonable price of Number One Chinese Rice (i.e., Japonica rice) should also be determined by the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee. The Bureau also notified the Evaluation Committee that if it encounters difficulties in investigating the actual cost required for continued procurement, the Bureau's Price Investigation Department will be happy to assist."

Domestic Rice Prices Must Be Limited

Yesterday, the price difference between domestic rice and foreign rice reached about 20 yuan per stone. The highest price of domestic rice was 92 yuan, and the price of Number One Saigon rice was over 72 yuan. Recently, the daily source of domestic rice has accounted for two-tenths of the total goods arriving in the city, but the sales targets are all middle and upper classes. If the price of domestic rice is too high, it will inevitably affect the upward price of foreign rice. Therefore, appropriately limiting the selling price of domestic rice can also be said to be a way to suppress the rising price of foreign rice.

Rice Prices Should Not Rise So High

The Bureau also stated that regarding the crux of the rising rice prices last month, it is said that the tension in the Vietnam incident in early October, the evolution after the signing of the Franco-Japanese agreement, the deep fear of the interruption of the Shanghai defense route, the control of rice transport to Shanghai, and the sharp drop in foreign exchange rates were all the main causes of the rice panic at that time. Rice is the most important food for the Chinese people, and its wholesale and retail markets have been greatly affected by the above-mentioned situations, making the livelihoods of Chinese workers and salaried classes increasingly difficult. Shanghai's rice reserves are abundant and are still being imported in batches. Judging from the facts, the rice prices at that time should not have risen so high. A responsible person from the Bureau also claimed that according to the Bureau's investigation, current rice reserves are becoming increasingly full, and the high rice prices are due to manipulation and monopoly by speculative rice merchants, and it is particularly surprising that rice prices turned upward again yesterday.

Sources Are Smooth and Plentiful, Prices Continue to Fall

Yesterday's rice market, due to the surge of both domestic and foreign rice, speculators have lost their excuse. It is estimated that 2,000 stones of domestic rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. In addition to the 27,807 bags of foreign rice and 760 bags of True Pearl rice that arrived in Shanghai on the French Shipping Company's "Keding" vessel, the Norwegian merchant vessel "Detda" also transported more than 57,000 bags previously.

Rising Flour Prices Have a Significant Impact

Since the price of flour has risen sharply, the Shanghai Machine-Made Noodles Industry Association notified all noodle shops last month to increase the price of noodles to 3.6 jiao per catty. The bakery industry also followed suit, increasing the prices of various breads by 2-3 fen. It has recently been learned that major pancake and fried dough stick stalls in the city are also planning to increase prices, making life for ordinary people increasingly difficult.

### US Transport Ship "Cape May" Arrives in Shanghai with Replacement Soldiers; Same Number of Soldiers to Be Transferred from Shanghai; Dependents of US Marines in North China Travel to the Philippines on the Ship

The Shanghai Times reported that the US Navy transport ship "Cape May" arrived in Shanghai yesterday (14th) afternoon from Qinhuangdao, carrying approximately 130 US Marine Corps soldiers to replace the same number of US Marine Corps soldiers being transferred from Shanghai. Dependents of US Navy personnel withdrawing from North China also traveled on the ship. It is expected that the "Cape May" will dock in Shanghai for five days, carrying 130 US Marine Corps soldiers and many dependents of US Navy personnel stationed in Shanghai, and will set sail next Monday to Manila. All of the Navy personnel's dependents will disembark in Manila and transfer to other ships to return to the United States. This is in accordance with the withdrawal plan formulated by the US Department of State.

### Central Bank Branches Operate as Usual

The English-language "China Press" reported that there were rumors that branches of the Central Bank, Communications Bank, Agricultural Bank, and Farmers Bank in the French Concession would be relocated to the US military defense zone. A reporter inquired with a senior official at the Central Bank, who denied the rumors circulating in Shanghai's banking community that the branches in the French Concession would be closed. According to the official, the Central Bank branch in the French Concession is only a branch, and its business activities are limited to normal banking transactions, just like other banks in Shanghai. However, if the branch can find suitable premises in the International Settlement, there is a strong possibility that it will move into the International Settlement. It is reported that the Central Bank branch in the French Concession is located in the Yiyuan Building at the intersection of Avenue Albert and Route Lafayette, and the branches of the China Bank, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank are all located on Avenue Joffre.

### Donation for the Inaugural National Air Defense Day

The 23rd of this month is National Air Defense Day, as designated by the National Government. All parts of the country will celebrate enthusiastically and promote air defense donations. Due to Shanghai's special circumstances, no commemorative ceremonies will be held. However, in view of the Air Force's repeated achievements and great contributions, and to commemorate the inaugural Air Defense Day, a donation campaign has been launched. All sectors are actively preparing to voluntarily donate air defense funds on that day, which will be collected and presented to the government to strengthen national air defense.

### American Passengers on the Washington Ship Extend Their Stay, Plan to Spend the Year in Shanghai and Return Home Next Year. The Ship is Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow.

The last of the U.S. government's evacuation ships, the Washington, is reportedly arriving in Shanghai tomorrow and will depart for Manila on the 21st, before heading to its destination in San Francisco. About five hundred American citizens have applied to return home on this ship. The details are as follows:

Many Have Applied to Cancel Tickets

According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury*, the Washington, the last evacuation ship sent by the U.S. government, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 17th of this month and depart on the 21st. Many American citizens in Shanghai planned to take this ship back home, but some have now changed their minds and applied to the American President Lines to cancel their tickets. According to sources at the President Lines, a considerable number of American citizens have postponed their departure for reasons unknown. It is said that some American citizens prefer to have their families spend the end of the year here and return home in early next year.

Total Number of Passengers Estimated at About Five Hundred

Judging from the current situation, only about five hundred American citizens in Shanghai will be evacuated on the Washington. The first-class cabins are less than one hundred, the tourist class cabins are less than two hundred and forty, and the third-class cabins are less than one hundred and sixty. There are still many vacancies in all classes, especially in tourist class. However, the number of passengers may increase significantly when the ship passes through Manila on its way back.

Most American Citizens Take President Liners

Tickets for the President Lines' President Taft (departed Shanghai on November 21), President Cleveland (departed Shanghai on December 9), and President Coolidge (departed Shanghai on December 31) are already sold out. Many people are waiting to buy returned tickets. At the same time, it is reported that the Mariposa, which carried 85 American citizens from Shanghai, arrived in Qinhuangdao on the 14th after departing on Sunday the 1st, and continued to carry 216 American citizens. However, it is still unknown how many American citizens this ship will carry in Incheon, Korea.

Only Seven Seek Assistance

According to the U.S. Consulate General this morning, only seven American citizens have applied for assistance to evacuate from Shanghai, including their families, totaling fifteen people. The consulate is currently investigating the financial situation of the applicants. If it is determined that they genuinely need government assistance, they will be helped to travel on the various regular ships of the President Lines.

### Special Prize-Linked Savings Bonds Not Sold in Shanghai

The Central Savings Association, in order to concentrate idle funds and strengthen government finances, has issued special prize-linked savings bonds with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, which have already been piloted in Chongqing. The issue date is in January of next year. These bonds will be issued every two months, with a total of 500,000 numbers. Each bond sells for 50 yuan, divided into five units, for a total revenue of 5 million yuan. One-quarter of the revenue will be used as prize money, with prizes ranging from first to tenth class. The first prize is 100,000 yuan. However, the bonds will not be issued in the occupied areas for the time being. In Shanghai, due to the special environment of the concessions, it is not planned to sell them. Prize winners are exempt from income tax. The Central Bank, Bank of Communications, Bank of China, Farmers Bank of China, and Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau are all sales agencies in various locations.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Drafts Telephone Price Increase Principles, Awaiting the French Municipal Council's Opinion Before Deciding; Excessive Increase Opposed by Chinese and Foreigners Alike

The Shanghai Telephone Company submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Council for a price increase months ago. The Council has considered the matter and repeatedly presented reports at its board meetings. The Council has now tentatively drafted a plan for the price increase, but it has not yet reached the final stage. The Council is currently sending the proposed price increase plan to the French Municipal Council for its consent. If the French Municipal Council raises any objections or makes any revisions, the plan will need to be reviewed and decided by the Council's board of directors again.

Provisional Measures As for the telephone price increase measures temporarily set by the Municipal Council, there are three principles: (1) The fees for business and residential telephones will increase by 30%, while the number of basic calls for business and residential telephones will be reduced. The number of basic calls for business telephones will be reduced from 150 to 100, and the number of basic calls for residential telephones will be reduced from 100 to 65. (2) Beyond the number of basic calls, the price per call for both business and residential telephones will increase from 3 cents to 7 cents. (3) For new users who want to install telephone sets in the future, the deposit will be equal to two years of monthly fees. The cost of moving telephone sets and installing extensions for new and old users will also increase from 100% to 150%.

Unanimous Opposition Although the telephone price increase plan has not yet been finalized, tens of thousands of Chinese and foreign telephone subscribers in Shanghai, as well as the general public, regard telephones as a public utility. The proposed price increase plan is excessive, as it affects both telephone subscribers and the general public who often use telephones. According to this plan, if the price increase is implemented, the price will increase not only horizontally (such as a 30% increase in monthly fees and a reduction in the number of basic calls), but also vertically (such as increasing the fee for calls beyond the basic number from 3 cents to 7 cents), which is more than doubled. Public utilities should not do this. Moreover, the development of the Shanghai Telephone Company in recent years is purely due to the increase in users within the concessions, which indirectly supports its business. It is unwise to increase the burden on users now. Chinese and foreign residents alike believe that this plan is an excessive increase and have unanimously expressed their opposition.

### Foreign Ships Detained, Shanghai-Zhejiang Shipping Severed, Maersk Ships Sailed to Songmen Yesterday and Have Withdrawn, Passengers of the Moufu Ship Not Allowed to Land and Imprisoned

The Shanghai-Zhejiang-Fujian shipping lines were severely affected by the Japanese military's announcement in mid-July this year to blockade eight ports including Xinghua. Recently, they suddenly announced the blockade of five ports including Gu'aotou, Shipu, and Haimen, and the Shanghai-Zhejiang shipping industry is facing a complete standstill. Although several foreign ships have taken risks,

Sailing to Fuqing is another question whether they can reach their destination. Yesterday, two Maersk ships sailing to Songmen and Gu'aotou were also obstructed and withdrawn to Shanghai. Previously, six foreign ships of German, Italian, British, and American nationality, Dasheng, Dacheng, Xinxingtai, Feikang, Moufu, and Anli, detained outside the Oujiang estuary, are all prohibited from entering Zhoushan Port. It was previously reported that more than 230 passengers on the Moufu ship had landed, but this is not accurate. It is said that they are still completely

Imprisoned on the ship, and the prepared food rice is about to run out. Therefore, a telegram was sent from the Japanese naval warship to the Moufu ship department, requesting 50 bags of rice and 3,000 yuan in cash. According to this, there is no intention to release them for a while. The company is now trying to transport the requested money and rice to provide assistance. It is also reported that the Haifu ship sailed back to Shanghai from Gu'aotou last Saturday (9th) and was expected to arrive early, but it has not been seen returning to Shanghai as of last night. There are rumors that it has also been detained, but this has not been confirmed for a while. The Haifu Shipping Department also denied it.

### "Guard Team" Negotiations for Withdrawal

After the Second Special District Court was seized, there was internal chaos. For several days, the French police station dispatched Chinese and Western detectives, riot police, and armored vehicles, fully armed, to station around the court. However, yesterday morning, it suddenly sent 50 armed "guard team" members, 20 of whom arrived first, delivered by trucks, and assigned to guard the "High Three" and "Special Two" "Courts." After negotiations with the police station, the guard team that was sent was immediately withdrawn.

District Court Records Sent to Nanshi

When the "August 13th" Shanghai War broke out in 1937, and Nanshi was subsequently reduced to rubble, the Nanshi District Court, in order to preserve various case files, entrusted the French Concession Special Court to keep most of the files, except for a small number of the most important ones that were kept separately. The number of case files reached more than 10,000. It has been three years since the court took over the custody of these files. According to the report of the Xinwenshe reporter, the seized Special Second Court has agreed to send the files to Nanshi, which is expected to be realized within a few days.

### Nearly 1,000 People Froze to Death in Half a Month, Coffin Prices Increased, Hoping for Donations

According to the Daguan News Agency reporter's inquiry at the Pushan Villa, the situation of adults and children who were collected by the villa due to freezing to death in the first half of this month is as follows: November (1st) 27 adult bodies, 40 children's bodies; (2nd) 22 adult bodies, 40 children's bodies; (3rd) 7 adult bodies, 30 children's bodies; (4th) 21 adult bodies, 29 children's bodies; (5th) 16 adult bodies, 39 children's bodies; (6th) 23 adult bodies, 40 children's bodies; (7th) 20 adult bodies, 39 children's bodies; (8th) 20 adult bodies, 49 children's bodies; (9th) 24 adult bodies, 34 children's bodies; (10th) 33 adult bodies, 52 children's bodies; (11th) 22 adult bodies, 47 children's bodies; (12th) 17 adult bodies, 54 children's bodies; (13th) 32 adult bodies, 48 children's bodies; (14th) 29 adult bodies, 55 children's bodies. In total, from the 1st to the 14th, there were 313 adult bodies and 648 children's bodies. The cost of making coffins for the villa is three to four yuan per coffin. Recently, due to the soaring price of wood, each coffin cannot be made for less than 20 yuan. This has greatly increased the expenditure of the villa. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will donate and promote good deeds.

### Negotiations to Reduce Meat Commission Failed

Recently, the price of meat has been rising frequently, with no hope of falling, which indirectly increases the burden on citizens and directly causes meat merchants to suffer major blows to their business. In order to reduce the heavy burden on citizens and protect the legitimate interests of the meat industry, yesterday afternoon, more than a dozen representatives of the fresh meat industry from the two concessions and four rural areas held direct negotiations with the representatives of the brokers of the Hongkou "Livestock Market". As a result, the negotiations broke down. The focus of the friction between the meat merchants and the "market" lies in the commission. Previously, the commission for each pig was one yuan, but now it is stipulated to extract three percent. Each "pig" will have to pay a commission of five or six yuan. The original commission was one percent, but now it has increased to three percent. At 4 pm yesterday, the meat merchants negotiated with the brokers to reduce the commission, but the brokers shirked and refused, saying that there was no room for negotiation, and said that the "market" would extract a commission of one dime and could only obey unconditionally. There was no result at all. Now the meat merchants are determined due to business relations, and it will cause a serious storm.

### After a Japanese Officer Was Shot, the Japanese Side Conducted a Strict Search, Claiming to Have Discovered Clues in Hongkou

At 1:30 pm the day before yesterday, a Japanese army captain named Ishibashi was shot and wounded in Haining Road, Hongkou. A brief account has been recorded in this newspaper. According to the Xinwenshe reporter, Ishibashi was shot twice at the time, both piercing his left scapula. He is currently undergoing surgery by Japanese doctor Honda at the Douin Association Hospital. When Ishibashi was shot, a Chinese youth named Shi Miaofa (18 years old, living in Jiugengli, Haining Road) was hit in the right flank by a stray bullet, but the bullet only grazed him and there was no major problem. It is also learned that after the Japanese Marines and others mobilized to guard the area after the incident, the Japanese side found an unexploded bullet and three medicine bags at the scene. The Japanese side is now investigating based on these clues. Yesterday, the Japanese side also announced that after the incident, a traveler named Dong Changxian (26 years old) in the Chunyang Inn at No. 61, Lane 311, Dongyouheng Road, suddenly went out and never returned. There has been no news so far. The Japanese side said that the traveler was carrying more than 6,000 yuan in cash, so they thought it was suspicious, but this person could not be found. At the same time, the Japanese side also said that at about 4:10 pm on the same day, near Feilun Road, a man about 45 years old was spotted by the consular police team that was dispatched, but he escaped without a trace after being stopped and searched. Therefore, the Japanese side is now paying close attention to these two incidents and is conducting a major investigation.

### Yesterday Was Philippine National Day, Filipinos Celebrated Enthusiastically, Business Corps Philippine Team Held Exercises, Chinese Consul in Philippines Wrote Congratulatory Article

Yesterday was the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the Philippine Republic. Filipinos here celebrated it specially, with each person wearing the national emblem on their lapel. The Philippine team of the International Business Corps has 85 members. They are responsible for the security of the Shanghai concessions. Since its establishment in 1927, the team has repeatedly achieved good results. The team is commanded by Stevens. Yesterday, they held exercises at the racecourse. According to the friendly relations between China and the Philippines, which have always been extremely harmonious, the Chinese government recently sent Wu Tiecheng to visit the Philippines. There are now more than 200,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines.

Chinese Consul in Philippines Wrote Congratulatory Article Yang Guangzheng, the Chinese Consul in the Philippines, wrote a special article to congratulate the Philippine National Day, saying that the Philippine people will once again celebrate the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the Republic. The Chinese people are eager to take this opportunity to wish the Philippines prosperity. In this turbulent world, the Philippines is in the midst of this vortex, but still remains outside of it. The overseas Chinese living in the country are also able to live and work in peace and contentment, which is very fortunate. On this auspicious occasion, we must express our gratitude to the Philippine government and people. Today, the Philippine people will plant another sign on their road to achieving full independence. We firmly believe that they will not only become a fully developed country, but also a bastion of peace, democracy, and friendly international relations in Asia.

Fully Independent After Five Years According to the Philippines, it was discovered by the Spaniard Magellan on March 15, 1521, and was subsequently ruled by Spain for more than 370 years. In 1898, a war broke out between Spain and the United States. A U.S. fleet sailed directly to the Philippines and defeated the Spanish Navy, cooperating with internal elements in the Philippines. In December of the same year, the Treaty of Paris was signed, and the Philippines came into the hands of the United States. After repeated discussions by the U.S. government, the Philippine Republican government was established on November 15, 1935, and a constitution was passed, stipulating full independence after ten years. The current president of the Philippines is Quezon, and the vice president is Osmeña.

### American Citizens Celebrate Thanksgiving

The President of the United States has designated November 21 as this year's American Thanksgiving Day. In order to commemorate this festival, American citizens in Shanghai will gather at the Great Church on Jiangxi Road at 11 am on the 21st to participate in the Thanksgiving service organized by the American Citizens' Association. The service will end at 12 noon. The Thanksgiving service will be presided over by U.S. Consul General Lockhead, and U.S. Judge Hale Milick will read the President's proclamation, followed by speeches and religious ceremonies such as prayers by Bishop Ward. American citizens will also voluntarily perform appropriate music. The organizers have invited all American citizens and welcome friends from other countries to attend the service.

### Shanghai-Shaoxing Remittance Restored

The Shanghai-Shaoxing remittance of the Jianye Bank was temporarily suspended last month due to the fierce fighting in the suburbs of Shaoxing. After the recovery, it could not be restored immediately due to various reasons. According to the Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry to the relevant parties, the Shanghai-Shaoxing remittance of the bank has been restored, but the amount is limited to 1,000 yuan. In addition, the Shanghai Post Office has restored remittances to eastern Zhejiang, such as Zhuji, Shaoxing, Keqiao, and Linpu. In particular, the remittance business in various counties such as Ningbo, Yuyao, Cixi, Fenghua, and Yongjia is even more developed. However, the remittance to Zhenhai has not been restored since it was suspended in July, four months ago.

### Rongwu Society's Fourth Lecture on Scriptures, Discussing Similarities Between Christianity and Confucianism, Jesus Teaches People With "Love" Word With Broad Meaning

The fourth lecture on scriptures of the Rongwu Lecture Society was first introduced by Mr. Shen Daling, who invited Pastor Xie Songsan to talk about the similarities between Christianity and Confucianism. Then, Mr. Lu Guiliang explained in detail Mr. Xie's learning and enthusiasm. Mr. Xie then took the stage to give a lecture. His speech is as follows:

Religious Scholars Acknowledge Confucianism

Western countries have a discipline called comparative religious studies. Many universities and religious colleges have this department. Regarding the two religions of Confucianism and Christianity, the missionaries who came to China from Europe and the United States fifty or sixty years ago studied them in great detail. There are still English legacy papers published in the "Educational Affairs Magazine". Since the beginning of the Republic of China, the ceremonies such as offering sacrifices to heaven and Confucius have been abolished. Therefore, Christian religions do not study Confucianism very much. And during the anti-religious movement period, Confucian members often defended Confucianism as an ethical, moral, philosophical, political, and educational system, and should not be included in religion. But according to the views of Western religious scholars, Confucianism is recognized as one of the major religions prevailing in the world.

Confucius and Jesus Each Have Their Own Sources

Confucianism has a history of 2,500 years from Confucius to the present, and Christianity has a history of nearly 2,000 years from Jesus to the present. Confucius followed Yao and Shun and revised the ancient books of Tang, Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou to preserve the ancient rituals of China. Jesus was well versed in Hebrew classics from a young age and obeyed Jewish regulations. He said, "I did not come to abolish the law and the prophets; I came to fulfill them." Confucius preserved the cultural essence of the descendants of the emperor and passed it on to future generations. When Jesus was in the world, he tried his best to develop the religious nature of the Hebrew nation and implement the spirit of the ancient Mosaic law, as well as the teachings of the prophets and sages. When he taught the people, he often expounded the truth he saw himself.

Jesus Expounded the Spirit of Sacrifice

Finally, he announced to his twelve disciples that he was the son of God. The Jews valued prophets. When Jesus rose from the position of teacher to the dignity of Messiah (that is, savior), many people doubted and opposed him. When he was tried in the Jewish court, the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of God?" He said, "You have said so." This confession sentenced him to death. (See Matthew 26:63-66) He was crucified by the Jews. This is the difference between Jesus and Confucius.

Parents and Children In Filial Piety and Love

Now I will briefly compare the ethical concepts of Confucianism and Christianity. Confucius said, "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." Jesus said, "So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you." Confucianism emphasizes filial piety, but Christianity uses the word "love" to include everything. Children who love their parents and elders naturally know the meaning of "filial piety". Judaism includes filial piety in the Ten Commandments, that is, the fifth commandment, "Honor your father and your mother." Parents also use love as the greatest influence on their children. Not only do they teach and raise them, but they must also make their children's spiritual virtues grow day by day. Teach them to love God, believe in God, and the children who convert to Christ mostly also love their parents. In Christian families, children are closer to their parents. What they want to say to their parents is said naturally. Between father and son, only love can make children not fear and not do things that are clearly deceptive.

Marriage Based on Love

Similarly, the relationship between husband and wife is also based on love. One husband and two wives lacks the principle of Christianity to build a noble and pure family. Marriage is regarded as a sacred union, so the bride and groom must swear an oath of love and cooperation to the end before God and the people. They have the same ideal goal and work together for the happiness of the family. Such a family is built on "loving each other."

The Essence of Friendship Is Also the Same

Regarding the relationship between friends, Jesus and Confucianism also have similarities. The two words "loyalty and forgiveness" are the great way of Confucianism. Jesus still speaks the truth of "love". Confucius' friendship is the same as the friendship concept of the Greek philosopher Aristotle, that is, based on the principle of mutual love. Jesus said, "Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends." He also said, "Love your neighbor as yourself." The word "neighbor" here refers to neighbors who are not very familiar. In Jesus' view, the poor are also friends. A missionary is willing to go deep into Africa to serve the semi-civilized nations, be friends with them, and even give their lives for them. This spirit is in line with the teachings of Jesus.

Serving the Public, Respecting and Loving Each Other

Regarding the relationship between rulers and subjects, Confucianism was produced in the feudal era, so the ethics of rulers and subjects are naturally suitable. Mencius said, "The people are the most important", which seems suitable for modern democracy. Christianity advocates loving each other, so the principle of mutual respect is adopted between superior and subordinate officials. A small clerk, if he faithfully serves the country and the people, his status is also very respectable, because his personality is noble. According to the Christian explanation, officials in high positions are servants of the people. The name "public servant" was also created by countries that believe in Christianity. Jesus' doctrine also works in countries with kings. If those in power love the people, the people below will naturally love them. Christianity is based on "God is the father of people", so people treat each other as brothers and sisters. Christianity says that humanity and divinity cannot be separated. If there is to be a normal relationship between people, then there must be a normal relationship between people and God. Finally, he introduced the other religions besides the five major religions of the world and finished his lecture.

### Letter from Famous British Cartoonist Reports Recent Situation in London

A well-known foreign reporter in Shanghai recently received a letter from London from the famous British cartoonist David Low, reporting on Low's personal situation and discussing the German air raids on London. Judging from Hitler's past achievements in air raids, it can be proved that he wants to destroy London, but it is unknown how long it will take. As far as the current situation in London is concerned, St. Paul's Cathedral still stands, and the streets and shops are as lively as ever. The damage inflicted on London by the German planes is actually small. Although Hitler launched an aerial blitzkrieg strategy and repeatedly launched fierce bombings against London, the houses destroyed by the bombings in London are probably still less than 4%. Judging from this efficiency, it is impossible for Hitler to destroy the entire city, let alone conquer the entire country. According to Low, even the current losses suffered by London have cost Hitler a heavy price to achieve. Therefore, it is doubtful whether this aerial blitzkrieg strategy can continue for ten days or so in the future, and whether it can maintain this efficiency. According to Low, the cartoons he made are published in British and American newspapers and are very popular with readers, because they satirize current affairs and contain anti-aggression ideas.

### Madam Lei Junyao's Ninetieth Birthday Celebration - Gift Donations All Allocated to Charity, Specially Made Tea Sets as Souvenirs

Madam Sun Lei of Songjiang, from a family renowned for poetry and propriety, possessed innate filial piety and exceptional talent. She had the ability to memorize anything she read, was quite skilled in poetry, and in middle age, educated her children and managed the household with diligence, frugality, and strictness, earning her a reputation for virtue throughout the countryside. This year, she celebrates her ninetieth birthday, yet her mind remains sharp, her legs and feet nimble. During the day, she can write minuscule characters with ease, and at night, she can read newspaper articles with small print under the lamplight, truly embodying the saying:

“Longevity and health abound.” Madam Lei has three sons and two daughters. The eldest son, styled Junyue, received honors at the township level before reaching adulthood. During the Qing Guangxu period, he served as a writer and editor for this very newspaper for nearly twenty years before retiring due to age. Now at seventy-one years old, he continues to dedicate himself to writing tirelessly. The second son, Junyan, and the third son, Juncui, both graduated from the former Qing Jiangnan Higher School. Since the Republic era, they have served in the education sector, earning renown in their time. As Songjiang suffered from the ravages of war, the entire family sought refuge in Shanghai. On an auspicious day in the latter part of the tenth lunar month, to celebrate Madam Lei's

ninetieth birthday, the descendants planned to hold a family celebration to express their joy and affection. However, Madam Lei sternly refused. Not daring to go against their kind mother's wishes, the descendants recalled that for Madam Lei's seventieth birthday, coinciding with the great flood in the five northern provinces, she had reduced the banquet expenses by three hundred gold pieces and donated it as relief funds. Upon reaching her eightieth birthday, she specially made bowls and chopsticks, distributing them to relatives and friends, using the celebratory gifts received to raise one thousand yuan to build the "Year of Abundance and Longevity Bridge" on the western outskirts of Songjiang for the convenience of travelers. Following the previous example, this time they commissioned the making of tea sets as ninetieth birthday souvenirs, one pot and two cups, to be given to relatives and friends,

marking the family celebration and fostering good fortune for longevity. All gifts such as celebratory screens and candles were politely declined. Any cash gifts received would be entirely donated to charity, directly contributing to extending the lives of others and indirectly accumulating benevolent virtues. It is said that these commemorative gifts have been entrusted to the Saoyeshanfang Bookstore at the intersection of Qipan Street and Baoshan Street in this city for display. Anyone with kinship ties to the Lei family, as well as philanthropists from all walks of life, can directly contact the bookstore. This also embodies the meaning of longevity for oneself and for the world.

### Foreign Employees of the Municipal Council to Resume Long Leave

Since September of last year, the Municipal Council had suspended the granting of long leave to European or Western employees whose home countries were suffering from war. At the beginning of this year, it formulated temporary measures, allowing those employees to spend their long leave in the East. At the same time, the regulations for granting leave were slightly modified, but no one has applied for leave yet. Recently, the council has conducted a thorough review of this matter and decided to resume the long leave system starting from January next year. For those who previously had seven months of leave during the European war period, it will be shortened to six months. The travel destinations should be within the scope approved by the council and travel to Europe is not allowed. The travel allowance will not exceed the amount equivalent to a round-trip economy travel from Shanghai to Montreal, Canada.

### Women's Temperance Association Schedules Charity Bazaar

The Chinese Women's Temperance Association is a service organization for women in Shanghai. The association has established schools and craft workshops to promote the welfare of women, assist poor women, and promote women's employment. It will hold its annual charity bazaar on November 23rd and 24th. The items for sale include self-made goods, as well as a large number of donations from major companies, department stores, pharmacies, and seed companies. The association is actively preparing for the event, and it is expected to be a grand occasion. It is hoped that all sectors will provide support, especially female compatriots.

### Enjoy the Pleasures of Life

We should enjoy the pleasures of life while we are living. No matter what kind of work we do, we should always be happy and joyful, only then can we feel the interest in our work. There is an old Chinese saying, "People cannot always be...," which contains truth, because how can a person who is always frowning and bitter-faced succeed? The ancient Greeks also had a saying: "A sound mind in a sound body." Therefore, no matter what we do, we must have a healthy body.

However, no one can escape illness altogether. Not to mention those dangerous and serious diseases, even if there is a little pain! Headache, toothache, rheumatism, neuralgia, or menstrual pain! You will feel extremely painful. With this kind of pain, we feel disappointed because we cannot enjoy entertainment, cannot attend parties, and even watching a movie becomes impossible.

But this pain can be quickly stopped, so there is no need to endure it. The fastest and safest way to relieve pain is to swallow one or two Sanli Tablets. Within ten minutes, the pain will completely subside, and our body will be very comfortable. Sanli Tablets are manufactured by Hoffman Co., Ltd. of Switzerland, so they are absolutely safe and reliable.

### Female Teacher Marries Cotton Cloth Merchant - Seeks Divorce Due to Intolerable Abuse - Both Sides Argue in Court - Court Adjourns and Advises Reconciliation

No. 3, Lane 363, Road in the Public Concession.

Zhou Qifu, the young master of Zhou Yuanji Cotton Cloth Store, married Chen Jinxia (26 years old this year) as his wife six years ago. Zhou only studied at the elementary level for two years, knows very few characters, while Chen graduated from middle school. The couple often quarrel due to the inequality in their education. Chen advises

her husband to pursue education, but Zhou refuses to listen and instead believes his second sister-in-law's words, repeatedly abusing Chen.

For the sake of self-reliance, Chen not only works as an elementary school teacher during the day, but also works as a private tutor in the evening. Her monthly income is quite

self-sufficient. Because Chen teaches and goes to bed early at night, and gets up early in the morning, Zhou often

enters the room when Chen is fast asleep, and does not get up early in the morning, resulting in the emotions between the two sexes becoming increasingly cold

light. Whenever the couple quarrels, Zhou's second sister-in-law often stands on the same line as Zhou. Chen, unable to bear the heavy abuse, once took sleeping pills

unsuccessful suicide.

Later, Chen left the Zhou family and lived in the school, hoping her husband would repent. However, for more than a year, Zhou has never cared about Chen. Therefore, Chen filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court Civil Division, requesting to divorce Zhou on the grounds that he has no marital affection. Chen said that Zhou Yuanji Cotton Cloth Store often changes the labels of certain goods at night to falsely impersonate domestic goods. Because she is a teacher and cannot participate in the work at night, she cannot

win her husband's favor and is dissatisfied by Zhou's eldest brother. Her incompatibility with the Zhou family is also one of the main reasons, so she has no choice but to seek divorce. The case was tried yesterday by Judge Tao Dejun of Civil Division One. Both parties appeared in court with their respective lawyers. According to the plaintiff Chen's testimony, she narrated the various forms of abuse, which the defendant Zhou

completely denied. The two sides argued for a long time in court. Judge Tao took marriage

with great care

and hoped that both sides would take a step back and reconcile. However, Chen expressed to the court that she would never want to return to the Zhou family. After hearing the case, the court adjourned the case to November 27 for further hearing. During the adjournment, it is hoped that the lawyers of both sides will mediate to allow the two sides to reunite. The court then adjourned.

### Letter

To whom it may concern, I recently read a news item in today's newspaper about a robbery on Nanjing Road, which stated, "A short-dressed bandit fled to the front of the Japanese-owned Lichang Printing House at No. 295, Jiujiang Road," etc. I was deeply surprised. The building at No. 295, Jiujiang Road, is occupied by a company composed of merchants from Sichuan, engaged in transportation, trade, trust, insurance and other businesses. The so-called Japanese-owned and "printing house" are all based on inaccurate inquiries. Therefore, I hereby issue this letter for clarification. It is hoped that you will make corrections. Sincerely, Lichang Co., Ltd., November 15th.

### Deer, Wolf, Rat

— Pinyin

A telegram from Siberia on the fifth of this month stated that 10,000 wild deer were migrating in the eastern part of the region due to the sudden cold weather that made it impossible for them to survive. This is a common phenomenon in the animal kingdom and is not surprising; but the sight of the migration at that time was quite strange. The telegram reads as follows:

"A large number of wolves followed the deer herd, attacking the weak and sick deer; behind the wolf pack, countless wild rats followed, devouring the remains abandoned by the wolves."

Upon closer examination of this record, I felt that in addition to being strange, I also understood a revelation about a major problem for mankind.

Wild deer—more precisely, reindeer—are the main creatures in cold regions, very docile, and useful. In philosophical terms, they are "good." They migrated for a kind of oppression, but were chased by wolves, and the elderly suffered unnecessary sacrifices. Those wolves truly belong to the "evil" side. Wolves take advantage of the fire to rob and help the tyrant to abuse, and are enemies of the deer. Those wild rats, with their rat-like heads and sneaky eyes, hide behind the evil forces, picking up some leftover flesh and blood to satisfy their greed. They are not only ugly, but also despicable. They hoard rice grains and raise prices, sucking the flesh and blood of civilians in the midst of water and fire. They are the humble rat pack. Oppression and pursuit can be resisted, but can nothing be done about the jumping clowns?

Arise, you who do not want to be slaughtered, fight to the death with all evil forces!

### The Forgotten Old Man

— Pei Ling

After two or three days, people simply seemed to have forgotten that such a person ever existed in the world. When the master had leftovers and told the servants, "Pour it out for the old beggar to eat!" the servants would respectfully reply, "Master! He is already dead!"

"Oh! He's already dead!"

Like the end of other small matters, this matter ended in this way.

What kind of person was he after all? He was just a beggar with no place to stand. People called him the old beggar. But he was not an ordinary beggar. According to his thoughts and actions, he could be called "an old patriot" without shame; yet he was eventually forgotten. In the whole alley, my relationship with him was considered the closest. Until now, he still leaves an indelible impression in my mind!

There was a small open space at the entrance of the alley, which was left over when the house was built. In the past, the gatekeeper of the alley built a small wooden house there and lived in it. A year ago, the gatekeeper died, and the wooden house had been empty ever since. One morning, an old beggar was found at the entrance of the alley, shivering on the ground. So everyone "submitted for approval" to the landlord and allowed him to live in the house and serve as the gatekeeper without pay. The families would give him the leftover food, and this had been going on for more than three months.

He, according to himself, was already seventy-four years old. Judging by his appearance, he should be that old. The wrinkles on his face, the white beard, and the seven or eight teeth could all prove that he had lived in this world for more than seventy years. All the children in the alley liked him very much, probably because he could tell stories. When my younger siblings came back after listening to his stories, they all told me that they were very good, even better than the teachers at school. Encouraged by them, on the second night, I also quietly went to listen. He was telling the story of "Yan Yingyuan Defending Jiangyin." His small room was crowded with thirteen or fourteen children, and I was standing outside the door. Not a single child spoke, only his old voice trembled in the west wind, tragic and intense.

"Tell another one! Tell another one!" When he stopped, the children all clamored.

"I won't tell any more! I'm sorry, young masters! How about telling one each day?" he said to the children in a pleading tone.

The children did not object and walked out of his wooden house one by one. In the alley, they were all excitedly telling each other:

"It's really good!"

"Get ready earlier tomorrow!"

"I'll bring cookies to give him tomorrow!"

I walked into his room. He was pouring a cup of cold tea from a broken teapot and drinking it. When he saw me come in, he looked at me with surprised eyes.

"It's really hard for you to tell these stories to the children!"

"Don't mention it! Young master, alas, I'm old! I can't tell the young masters any better stories!"

"Do you have any sons?"

He looked at me, and a tear fell on the table.

"Alas! Poor thing, the eldest son was beaten to death, the youngest son was bombed to death! Leaving me, this miserable old man."

These few words can represent his entire history of blood and tears. I couldn't bear to ask any further. Compassion compelled me, and my hand took out a one-yuan bill from my pocket and stuffed it into his trembling hand.

"Keep this money for your use."

He didn't say anything. After a long time, he blurted out:

"Young master, you are so kind!"

On the evening of National Day, I came home very late. As I walked into the alley, someone grabbed my hand in the darkness, and then a familiar voice sounded:

"Young master! It's me!"

"What?" I shone a flashlight on him.

He quickly took out a one-yuan bill from his pocket - the one I had given him - and also took out a two-jiao bill, five one-jiao bills, and six five-fen bills, and stuffed them all into my palm.

"Please donate this to the country for me."

I was stunned.

"Thank you! Young master! These two yuan in total were saved by me on weekdays. I'm old and don't need them anymore. Please donate them to the country for me!"

After he finished speaking, he returned to the small house.

On a windy morning, when I got up, the nanny told me that the old beggar was dead, frozen to death!

Without waiting to put on my clothes, I ran to the small wooden house in two steps. I couldn't see him anymore. Others told me that he had been sent to a certain mountain village. Two tears streamed down my face. A familiar voice rang in my ears again:

"Leaving me, this miserable old man!"

Now, he has long been forgotten by people. Sometimes, when the nannies happen to gather together for a chat, they remember that they haven't poured leftovers for him for a long time.

But he is, after all, a person worthy of praise, even though he is forgotten.

Hawthorn Detective Case

### The Final Fate of the Dancing Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 11: Zhao Boxiong's Confession

Zhao Boxiong continued: I lingered outside the low wall for quite a while. Wang Lilan seemed to be doing her best to flatter the raincoat-clad man, and her attitude was very flirtatious. However, as I've said, I didn't see the most important part. I suspect that she handed in that invalid telegram around this time. But I seemed to see that man taking something out and giving it to her before he left. Then I saw him back out.

"My original intention was to deal with this shameless woman, but when I got to that point, I changed my mind on the spot. I planned to first take a look at the true face of this raincoat-clad man, and if possible, I also wanted to find out his whereabouts. Therefore, when he backed out, I still hid in the open space next door to the west, and I saw that the man was not very old, and he had some short whiskers on his upper lip. As soon as he went out, he turned east at the corner of Datong Road."

Hawthorn suddenly picked up the paper cutter and held it up, saying: "Slow down, we had a doubt at the time that was not easy to explain. Since she was so solicitous towards that raincoat-clad man, it would be reasonable for her to see him off, but in fact she didn't. I know that after you waited for that raincoat-clad man to come out, you also peeked into that reception room again. I think you can explain this mystery of why she didn't see him off, right?"

The young old man nodded and said, "Yes, I also thought at the time that she would see him off, but in the end, I only saw him coming out alone; therefore, I was a little surprised, so I took another look. It turned out that there was another guest in the room at that time, so she couldn't see her employer out."

I couldn't help but say in surprise: "Another guest? How did he get in? Could it be from the back door?"

Hawthorn suddenly looked up at me and said, "Bao Lang, no. This guest was already in the house, so he didn't need to enter through the front or back door."

Zhao Boxiong nodded quickly and said: "Yes, yes. In a glimpse, I saw Lilan's husband, Li Zhiban, with a cigarette in his mouth, already walking into the reception room. Lilan was opening the window and pulling back the curtains. I understood the reason why she didn't see him off, and because I wanted to track down the person wearing the raincoat, I hurried back to the car and drove around the corner. When I entered Datong Road, the man's car had already driven far away. After chasing for two blocks, I stopped again, and in the end, I lost hope. I had to return to Qingpu Road again and parked the car in the original place. At that time, the raindrops were much smaller. I went to the outside of the low wall again to take a look. The lights in the guest room were still bright, the window was also open, and Lilan was sitting behind the desk. The old man seemed to be no longer in the room. I thought this was a good opportunity that should not be missed! So I aimed at her heart and fired a shot, and then I quietly returned to the car and drove back to Yadong." (167)

### Expectations for the Shanghai Drama School

— Zhisu

Engaging in the Arrangement of Meaningful New Plays

The establishment of the Shanghai Drama School has continued a good lineage for the future of Peking Opera. Although the school has been established for less than a year, under the efforts of the hosts and teachers, the results have been remarkable. Now, the school stipulates that performances be held at the Golden Grand Theater every Wednesday and Saturday. The performances of that group of little angels have been praised by many.

I once saw their "Si Lang Visits His Mother" and "Yang Xiangwu Steals the Nine Dragon Cups." The children's skilled and brilliant performances and singing are truly worthy of praise. Generally speaking, the school has already achieved the goal of preserving the inherent essence of the old dramas, but this is also a pity; because in this great era, the advocacy of drama is not just about providing entertainment to the audience. In addition to entertainment, it must also give the audience education. Drama is the best tool for education, especially the Shanghai Drama School, which cultivates future stage newcomers, who are different from ordinary actors, and of course it is hoped that they will take on the responsibility of educating the masses through the power of drama. Now, looking at the plays performed by the Shanghai Drama School, they are almost purely old dramas, and at the same time, the selection of scripts does not seem to have undergone strict consideration. For example, the chivalrous heroism of "Yang Xiangwu Steals the Nine Dragon Cups" may be advocated, but plays like "Qingshi Mountain" that exaggerate gods and monsters are inevitably close to superstition, and it seems that there is no need to introduce them.

Of course, the original essence of the old dramas must be preserved on the one hand, but on the other hand, meaningful new dramas should also be created. It is impossible to expect the general professional actors to realize this task (except for a few actors with progressive ideas), and the Shanghai Drama School was born in this great era, and what is cultivated is a group of future stage newcomers, who can take on this great responsibility, create new life for the drama industry, and open up a new road.

I think that the Shanghai Drama School should first organize a scriptwriting committee, recruit experts who have always studied drama, and engage in the arrangement of new dramas with the meaning of the times, to create rich dramas with new ideas in the old form. For example, the famous dramas "Ge Nunniang" and "Hai Guo Yingxiong" are very valuable and can be adapted into Peking Opera. (In addition, "Ningwuguan" and "Fighting the Jin Soldiers," etc., can also be re-edited.)

To put it bluntly: if you don’t engage in the creation of new plays, and always sing the same old and decaying plays such as "Yu Tangchun," "Er Jin Gong," and "Si Lang Visits His Mother," who will "appreciate" it decades later?

Therefore, I hope that the Shanghai Drama School can make good use of its current superior position and shoulder this extraordinary mission.

### Yan Yueleng's Activities

— Xingxing

Yan Yueleng, mentioning her, everyone shouldn't feel too unfamiliar, right? She is Yan Yuexian's younger sister, playing Du Shiniang's friend, also a prostitute, in "Du Shiniang."

She is still a newcomer in the film industry, having just joined Guolian in March of this year. After completing "Du Shiniang," her new work is "Qian Nü Huan Hun" (The Reincarnation of Qian Nü), co-starring with Chen Yanyan and others, which is adapted from "Tragedy on the Lake." Speaking of Yueleng appearing on the screen, "Du Shiniang" was not her first attempt. As early as when Lianhua Film Company was filming "Yu Guang Qu" (Song of the Fishermen) starring Wang Renmei, she participated, and her youngest sister, Yuemei, also played a role. In order to shoot outdoor scenes, she even went to Ningbo with Wang Renmei and others. Later, she also made a guest appearance in Guohua, filming "Yemingzhu" (Night-Shining Pearl) with her sister Yan Yuexian.

So, in total, this "Qian Nü You Hun" is Yan Yueleng's fourth work to appear on the screen. Originally, the role she was to play in "Qian Nü Huan Hun" was the older sister of Chen Yanyan's character, but later the director felt that Yueleng was young, and playing Yanyan's older sister did not seem very suitable. So it was decided to change the role, removing the older sister role and changing it to Chen Yanyan's younger sister. This change, of course, could not have been more appropriate, so "Qian Nü Huan Hun" was able to proceed actively and smoothly.

### New Discovery in "Women" Miss Gu Han Active in the Art Scene

— Tieliu

Miss Gu Han, who had been silent for a long time, was discovered in the China Travel Troupe's play "Women." Long-term performances in drama can be said to have been pioneered by the Red Star Theater in the spring of last year, but it was a flash in the pan, and it soon ceased. Miss Gu Han of Red Star successively performed "The Imperial Envoy," "Sunrise," "Ren Zhi Chu" (The Beginning of Man), and other plays, winning considerable praise. Someone who knew her background published the elegant title "Director's Miss" for her in the newspaper. This magazine also published an interview with her, including text and photos.

After Red Star closed, Gu Han's name was still often found in newspapers, saying that she was going to appear on the screen. When Yi Hua was producing "Wang Baochuan," she competed for the role of Princess Daizhan, but as a result, it was played by Diao Banhua. It did not become a reality, although she was highly appreciated by director Wu Cun. After this setback, it was later rumored that she had joined Xinhua and would perform in "Xi Shi," but for some reason, it did not come to fruition. And the role of Liu Xuangu in Hezhong's "Wen Suchen" was also considered for her before Yang Wenying was decided upon. As time went on, Gu Han's name gradually faded. But someone discovered that she had served as a drama instructor at a certain tutorial school.

Now, the China Travel Troupe is performing "Women," a play performed entirely by women, and it has been discovered that the long-studying Tian Xiulan's role is natural and without excessive enthusiasm. Her footsteps have been extensive, and her life experience is naturally rich. Her speech is clear and bright. Now she is once again active in the art scene, adding a unique touch to the China Travel Troupe. Tang Huaiqiu can be considered to have had a very discerning eye.
