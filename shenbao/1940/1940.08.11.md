### Japan Increasingly Eyes Vietnam; French Troops Conduct Naval Exercises; British Newspaper Claims French Government Will Succumb to Japanese Demands; Nishihara Flies Back to Hanoi with New Instructions from Japanese Government

The diplomatic correspondent for the London Daily Mail claims that the Pétain government is expected to succumb to Japan's demands regarding Vietnam within the next few days. The main demands are to build naval and military bases in Vietnam and to use the country as a passage to attack Yunnan. Japan views this as a political method, and it is undoubtedly a preliminary plan for a military occupation and eventual annexation of the entire country of Vietnam. Although Japan has not yet officially presented an ultimatum, it has informally hinted that it will resort to force if France does not yield. The German and Italian governments may advise General Pétain to quickly comply with Japan's demands. (Reuters, 10th)

A dispatch from London this morning in the Daily Telegraph states that the French Asian fleet is conducting exercises in Vietnamese waters. It is widely believed that this news demonstrates a hardening of the French authorities' attitude towards Japanese demands. However, British sources believe that this is merely a precautionary measure and will not immediately lead to serious consequences. (International News Service, 10th)

Tokyo: According to semi-official Japanese sources, Major General Nishihara, leader of the Japanese inspection mission to Vietnam, returned to Hanoi yesterday with instructions from Tokyo. It is expected that Nishihara, after receiving a report on the progress of negotiations between the Japanese inspection mission and the Vietnamese authorities, will meet with Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam to accelerate the negotiations based on the Tokyo instructions he brought back. (Reuters, 10th)

French and Japanese to Continue Negotiations

Hanoi: Major General Nishihara, the Japanese supervisor in Vietnam, returned here yesterday from the east by plane. He was accompanied by a certain secretary from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The plane arrived at 2:30 PM. It is said that Major General Nishihara has received new instructions from Tokyo and may reopen negotiations with the Vietnamese authorities within a few days. The contents of the Japanese government's instructions to Nishihara are unknown. According to Japanese sources here, Nishihara's return should dispel the fears of the French that Japan is preparing to use military force against Vietnam, as Nishihara's return indicates Japan's intention to continue friendly negotiations with the Vietnamese authorities. (United Press, 10th)

Hanoi: Due to the return of Major General Nishihara, the Japanese supervisor, to Hanoi, the tense situation in Vietnam has eased. It is rumored that Japan and the Vietnamese authorities are expected to continue friendly negotiations. (United Press International, 10th)

Vichy: French Foreign Minister Baudouin recently discussed Japan's demands regarding Vietnam with Japanese Ambassador to France, Sawada. French sources say that the talks are focused on the mutual interests of the two countries and are currently underway. (United Press, 10th)

China Hopes France Will Form an Alliance to Resist Aggression

Chongqing: Chinese newspapers have recently been advising the French government to form a military alliance with the Chongqing government to jointly defend Vietnam. Local newspapers have also unanimously warned that, regardless of France's decision, the Chinese government will resist any Japanese aggression against Vietnam. Chinese newspapers have also prominently published an unconfirmed report stating that the French government has decided to resist Japanese military pressure. The Xinmin Daily stated that if France requests our assistance in defending its colonies, we will not hesitate to provide all possible assistance. The newspaper also stated that France should join hands with China to defend Vietnam against Japan. If France does not take this reasonable measure, we will not hesitate to fulfill our obligation to defend Vietnam by force. We will never allow the Japanese to occupy Vietnam, because if the Japanese occupy Vietnam, they will undoubtedly launch attacks against the Chinese mainland from there. The influential Ta Kung Pao expressed great welcome to the unconfirmed report (namely, the news that France had decided to resist Japanese aggression against Vietnam). "A large number of Chinese troops have already been stationed on the Vietnamese border. These troops can be a powerful reinforcement to the Vietnamese defense forces. Japan is well aware of its own weakness, so it is still hesitating about whether to take military action against Vietnam. Countries with vested interests in the Pacific, such as Germany, Britain, and the United States, are prepared to inflict a major blow on Japan if it seizes the opportunity of France's defeat to seize French colonies. If France decides to adopt a policy of resistance, then it can be said that it has grasped the key to success." (United Press, 10th)

Traffic Obstructions, Goods Piled Up in Warehouses

Hong Kong: The Hong Kong Daily recently reported that a certain company formerly purchased a large batch of goods from foreign countries on behalf of the Chinese government. Due to traffic obstructions, these goods cannot be transported to the Chinese mainland and are piled up in warehouses here, with a total value of no less than several million dollars. The companies concerned are planning to resell these goods, and one of them has already entered into negotiations with an American manufacturer, willing to return the goods to the original owner. (Havas Agency, 9th)

Manila: It was learned here yesterday that twenty American warplanes, along with a large quantity of explosives, artillery shells, and other military equipment, are being temporarily stored in Manila until the滇缅公路 (Burma Road) is reopened, as orders have been received from the Chinese government.

The local military and civilians gathered at the station to warmly welcome them. According to Chen Xiannang, Anhui Province has implemented a unified party, military, and political policy in recent years, with extremely rapid progress. The Japanese-occupied areas are shrinking daily, and the puppet troops in various places are rebelling one after another, dealing heavy blows to the Japanese. The Dabie Mountains have sufficient reserves of materials, and any difficulties can be overcome in the future. (Dispatch, 10th)

### Ninety Japanese Planes Raid Chongqing in Three Waves Yesterday; The South Bank of the Yangtze River Is Not Safe; Bombs Were Also Dropped in the Banking Area

Chongqing: At 2:40 PM today, ninety Japanese bombers in three waves raided Chongqing. The bombed area was quite wide, extending from the north bank of the Jialing River to the south bank of the Yangtze River, with bombs falling in seven locations and causing fires. However, the estimated number of casualties is less than one hundred. The fires in other locations were extinguished three hours after the bombing, but the large fire at a tung oil factory on the south bank of the Yangtze River has not yet been extinguished. Several bombs fell around the banking area, but none of Chongqing's major modern bank buildings were hit, except for some damage to the stone wall facade of the Juxingcheng Bank. The YMCA building was directly hit and suffered heavy damage. The situation on the south bank is currently unclear. Recalling that just a few days ago, the Chinese authorities warned citizens not to take refuge on the south bank during air raids, explaining that Japan's guarantee that the south bank had been recognized as a safe area was unreliable. (Reuters, 10th)

Tokyo: According to semi-official Japanese sources, General Chiang Kai-shek's residence was "partially destroyed" during yesterday's Japanese air raid on Chongqing. (Reuters, 10th)

### A Glimpse of the Current Situation in Hong Kong

Hong Kong: The Hong Kong Daily recently reported that the city has been greatly affected since the evacuation of women and children, especially for stores selling children's and women's clothing, especially fashion boutiques. However, stores selling Chinese women's clothing and Indian silk stores still maintain a large number of customers. Generally speaking, business in July decreased by 30% compared to before. As for restaurants and hotels, business has actually increased because women have left and men have to eat out. However, most domestic helpers have lost their jobs, and jewelry and antique stores have also been affected, relying solely on foreign tourists to maintain business. In addition, bookstores originally thought that since women and children had been evacuated, business could greatly increase due to the general loneliness of men, but this is not the case and they are quite disappointed.

Song Ruhai, a representative of the Chinese branch of the World Student Association, gave a dinner party for him at Guanshengyuan tonight. Coryess is a second-year student at the Union Theological Seminary in New York, 25 years old. He departed from the United States and traveled through Japan, Korea, Manchuria, Peiping, Jinan, Shanghai, Nanking, Hong Kong, and Kunming before arriving in Chongqing. After the dinner, Coryess shared his observations along the way, stating that Japan is experiencing a severe shortage of various raw materials, such as rubber, leather, cotton yarn, and matches, which have become scarce items. When he passed through Korea, his request to see six American Methodist school students imprisoned by the Japanese was rejected. Coryess mentioned that students in Peiping were frequently arrested by the Japanese authorities. Coryess only stayed in Nanking for a few hours. Coryess expressed his admiration for the spirit of hardship endured by the Chinese people and promised to inform the American public after returning to the United States, so that Americans could better understand the greatness of the Chinese people's spirit of resistance. Coryess will stay in Chongqing for a week and then visit Lanzhou, Xi'an, Luoyang, Chengdu, and other places before returning to the United States in September. (Dispatch, 10th)

Editorial

### British Troop Withdrawal

The British War Office formally announced the day before yesterday, that is, September 9, that the British troops currently stationed in Shanghai and North China will be withdrawn and transferred to other locations. It should be noted that there is no fixed number of British troops stationed in China. Currently, there are 50 troops stationed in Peiping, 120 in Tianjin, and in Shanghai, in addition to three battalions, there are medical teams, nursing teams, transportation teams, engineering teams, service teams, and military police, totaling 1,570 officers and soldiers, with a complete organization and full equipment. The troops in the three locations are under the command of Major General Simmons. It is said that the departure date is next week; however, what the British War Office announced only stated that they would be withdrawn, without a definite time limit; and whether this withdrawal is due to military strategic considerations remains to be discussed, as the original intention of their presence in Shanghai and Tianjin was not based on military strategy. Military-strategic deployments are quickly withdrawn, while non-military deployments must wait for careful consideration and determination of the timing outside of military strategy. As for Shanghai, the situation is complex; the British troops stationed in Shanghai have a local international mission from the day they were stationed, so their withdrawal, although imperative due to their homeland's military orders, requires consultation and clear handover regarding the international mission. Therefore, whether the departure will take place next week is uncertain.

The British decision to withdraw troops from China is sudden. Judging from the matter itself, there are four points to recognize: First, British troops were stationed in China in 1899 during the Boxer Rebellion in Zhili and Shandong. The following year, the Allied forces captured Peking, and in 1901, the Boxer Protocol was signed. This is the treaty basis for the troop deployment. It concerns rights under the treaty, and rights exist as long as the treaty is in effect. It also concerns the joint action of the Allied forces, and there are mutual relations between the countries involved. Therefore, while withdrawing its troops, Britain declared that its treaty rights were still retained and notified the relevant countries at the same time. The connections here must be clearly understood. Second, troop deployment is only one aspect of treaty rights. Other rights based on the treaty also rely on the treaty for protection, not on the strength of the stationed troops. Third, treaty rights are not measured by the number of troops stationed or not, that is, the increase or decrease of stationed troops has nothing to do with other rights under the treaty, and it is not a symbol of the rise and fall of authority and power. Fourth, the British withdrawal of troops is based on the orders of its War Office, which has nothing to do with the British Navy. How the Far East Fleet will be dispatched and arranged after the army withdraws should be an object of attention in the future; in other words, Britain still has military force in the Far East, namely the navy.

The four points listed above are a very simple and clear explanation. Why did Britain suddenly take this action? Modern warfare is large-scale, requires sufficient strength, and precise calculations. Therefore, those who preside over military and national affairs internally and those who control the front and rear lines externally will not waste a single soldier or weapon. They cherish them, make good use of them, and strive for practical benefits. Britain is engaged in war against Germany and wants to concentrate all its strength for military strategic reasons, unwilling to have 1,740 soldiers linger in China for a long time. Indeed, if such a number is placed in a place where they cannot exert their strength, they can be annihilated in an instant; if they are used properly, they can also hold two or three strongholds and stand alone; weighing the importance and urgency, it is more advantageous to transfer them to other locations for service. What the British War Office announced contains no explanation of this kind. Is it that this explanation is the most dignified? Regardless of whether Britain will make an explanation on this or not, and regardless of whether it will explain it this way, given the close and complex relationship between Britain and the Far East, and the chaotic and muddled state of affairs in the Far East, with unpredictable brewing and evolution, it is insufficient to explain the troop withdrawal solely on the basis of the above-mentioned wartime military strategic reasons. The speculations of various parties are also divergent. Some say that Britain is using the troop withdrawal to indicate a compromise with Japan. However, Anglo-Japanese compromise cannot be established unless Britain withdraws from the Far East. The troop withdrawal cannot be regarded as a sign of withdrawal from the Far East, nor can it win Japan's favor; moreover, judging from the form and timing of the troop withdrawal, Britain has neither indicated acceptance of Japan's proposal for European belligerents to withdraw their troops stationed in China, nor has it used this as a subject for diplomatic negotiations; and compared with other recent British actions toward Japan, the compromise theory is hardly credible. Some say that Britain is using the troop withdrawal as a preparation for a tough stance against Japan. However, Britain's interests in Shanghai and Tianjin are considerable and cannot be protected by the strength of more than a thousand soldiers; but it would not be considered excessive to sacrifice those soldiers for the sake of those considerable interests; moreover, there are many ways to take a firm stance against Japan, the time for a break between Britain and Japan is still far away, and it is difficult for the British expatriates in Shanghai and Tianjin to evacuate. So why is the troop withdrawal easier and even comes first? Therefore, it is also unconvincing to say that this is a shift towards a tougher stance. Both are unlikely. In our speculation, Britain is aware of the difficulties it faces and is urgently seeking to strengthen the defenses of Hong Kong, Burma, Singapore, and other places. In addition, it is fortifying its defenses and clearing the fields, in order to gain the greatest freedom of action. The criteria for Britain's freedom of action and choices are: the strength of the German offensive, first; the intensity of Japanese pressure, second; and the international attitude of the United States and the situation of China's resistance, which are also major factors in its decision-making.

### British Withdrawal of Troops from China: American Position Unaffected; Three Actions Taken to Remedy Regret; Whether to Take Over British Defense Zone Undecided

Acting Secretary of State Welles stated here yesterday that although British troops in Shanghai are being withdrawn, the U.S. Marine Corps will, at least for the time being, remain stationed in Shanghai. Welles said that the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai numbers about 1,000, and the decision to maintain these troops is entirely the judgment and responsibility of the U.S. government. However, the U.S. government has not yet decided whether the U.S. Navy will take over the defense zone vacated by the British troops in Shanghai. Welles, in elaborating on the British withdrawal from China, reiterated that the U.S. government is prepared, "under appropriate circumstances," to abandon its right to station troops in China and other extraterritorial rights. Welles continued that the British action cannot currently change any aspect of U.S. policy. Senior officials here view the British troop withdrawal as damaging to British prestige but feel that this regret has been remedied by the following three U.S. actions in the Far East: (1) the U.S. improving relations with the Soviet Union; (2) the U.S. controlling export transportation, indirectly affecting Japan; and (3) the U.S. Senate including the Philippines within the region where national defense forces can be dispatched "for training." It is generally believed here that the withdrawing British troops will still be stationed somewhere in the Far East, most likely Hong Kong. Therefore, it is believed that the British withdrawal cannot be regarded as reducing British military strength in the Far East. Some well-informed sources believe that the improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations in recent days has compensated for British laxity in East Asia. Senior congressional leaders stated that, regardless of the British attitude, the U.S. does not intend to reduce or withdraw its troops stationed in China. The diplomatic community here believes that the withdrawal of the British defense force from Shanghai is a precautionary measure, as British-Japanese relations are currently strained. They point out that outposts like Shanghai would be indefensible in the event of an incident. (United Press dispatch, 10th)

U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles, when meeting with reporters today, addressed the British withdrawal of troops stationed in China, stating that the British had notified the U.S. of this decision in advance. However, this decision has no impact on the U.S. position in China. Whether this move by the British will result in a wider distribution of U.S. troops currently stationed in China is a matter for the local military authorities to decide. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

Non-official sources in Washington, while acknowledging that some British troops stationed in China, particularly those in Beijing, are of little use, feel that the withdrawal of British troops from Shanghai places an unfair burden on the U.S. Marine Corps to maintain the security of the International Settlement, as British interests are the greatest in the International Settlement. From a general policy perspective, any action that can be seen as a compromising gesture is particularly inappropriate at this time. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

Senator Stonebraker stated in the Senate yesterday that, according to reports received, "Japan is in danger of invading the Malay Peninsula, thereby threatening U.S. interests." He continued, "The U.S. fleet should remain stationed in the Pacific." (United Press dispatch, 10th)

This morning, all Chinese-language newspapers in Chongqing prominently published news of the British withdrawal of troops from Shanghai and North China, but without criticism. According to some Chinese opinions, this action may indicate that the British are now preparing for unforeseen circumstances in the Far East, concentrating their forces to defend Hong Kong and Singapore. Other Chinese, however, fear that this step may be the result of an understanding with Japan, including the British withdrawal from China and Japan undertaking to temporarily postpone an attack on Hong Kong. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

Since the news of the British withdrawal of troops from Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai reached Tianjin, the British military authorities here dispatched special patrols to inspect the streets and ordered British soldiers to return to their barracks. By 11 p.m. last night, no British troops were seen on the streets. It is widely believed that the British troops are likely heading to Hong Kong or Singapore. It is generally believed that after the British withdrawal, the patrolling of the British Concession will be taken over by the U.S. Navy. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 10th)

Ottawa sources believe that the British withdrawal of troops from China indicates that Japan is now preparing to exert pressure while Britain is occupied elsewhere. Britain is redeploying its troops stationed in China to concentrate on key locations to deter this move by Japan. Canadians are slightly apprehensive about this complex situation in Asia, while government officials remain silent on the matter. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

British Withdrawal of Troops from China: Japanese Newspapers See as Political Posture

Tokyo This morning, all Japanese newspapers featured the British decision to withdraw troops from China as the most important news. Although Britain retains its rights under the Beijing Treaty, general opinion believes that since British troops have withdrawn from China, they will not return and will have little impact. The Asahi Shimbun stated that this is a small scheme and cannot but be regarded as the final strategy when Germany invades Britain. If Britain sincerely wishes to compromise with Japan, it must immediately fundamentally reform its Far East policy and genuinely cooperate with Japan. According to the Hochi Shimbun, Foreign Minister Matsuoka, upon hearing the news, commented, "I think this move by Britain must be related to the spy case. But we can say that Britain is today in a helpless position and has no choice but to take this action." Matsuoka also said that Japan has not abandoned its intention to take countermeasures regarding the arrest of Japanese residents. "I think Britain's arrest of Japanese residents is not only out of retaliatory motives but has deeper meanings. Its purpose must be unpleasant. I cannot currently say what its purpose is, just as I cannot say what Japan's countermeasures will be." (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

Tokyo After Britain announced the withdrawal of troops stationed in China, people here were quite surprised. It is currently unknown whether Britain will entrust other countries to protect the British concessions in various places. Japan has opposed Britain's suggestion of having U.S. troops replace British troops, believing that all rights enjoyed by Britain should be returned to China immediately. The number of troops stationed in China by various countries is as follows: Beijing: British troops 50, Italian troops 50, French troops 50, U.S. troops 250; Tianjin: British troops 120, French troops 200, Italian troops 100, American troops 100; Shanghai: British officers 70, soldiers 1,500, French troops 1,000, Italian troops 205, U.S. officers 50, soldiers 1,000.

Military sources here believe that British troops stationed in China will be withdrawn to Egypt. They point out that Britain had no choice but to transfer these small numbers of troops due to the urgent war situation, and emphasize that Britain's troop withdrawal has significant political implications and can be seen as a sign of the rapid decline of British power in the Far East. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 10th)

Japanese Parliamentarians Pass Resolution Advocating Expulsion of British Influence

Hong Kong, Tokyo dispatch: One hundred and twenty-six members of parliament held a meeting last night and passed a resolution strongly condemning Britain for aiding China and hindering the construction of the "New Order in East Asia." The recent arrest of Japanese residents by the British is considered by the parliamentarians to be an extremely barbaric and unforgivable retaliatory measure against Japan. Therefore, they urge the government to take a firm stance and implement all effective measures to expel British influence in the Far East. (9th dispatch)

Hong Kong, Tokyo dispatch: This morning, representatives of the far-right Japanese political party (East Asia Association) visited Konoe, Matsuoka, Tojo, and Atsuta to personally deliver the party's petition, urging the government to declare war on Britain to completely resolve the incident of British arrest of Japanese residents. (9th dispatch)

Tokyo This morning, anti-British slogans were posted on the walls of people's homes in Tokyo, stating, "Negotiations are unnecessary; we must use the strength of the whole nation." (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 10th)

### Japan Eager to Resolve the War of Aggression Against China Soon: Affected by International Economy, Matsuoka Stresses the Need

Tokyo Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke told reporters that the Japanese government, within the scope of "building Greater East Asia," will cooperate fully with countries that agree with Japan's views, but Japan is determined to overcome all obstacles to the future. Matsuoka stressed the need to find a way to resolve the China Incident soon, but opposed compensatory and incomplete methods, because the China Incident cannot be solved independently from the general international situation. Matsuoka also pointed out the smooth progress of the negotiations between Ambassador Abe and Wang Jingwei to conclude a treaty, and predicted that this would be restored. He said that the Chongqing regime has now reached the final stage of its resistance against Japan. Approximately when General Chiang Kai-shek believes that those around him have a clear understanding of Japan's true intentions is not far away. The Chongqing regime's ability to resist Japan to date should be attributed to goods and military supplies supplied by various countries through the Vietnam and Burma roads. Transportation of aid to Chongqing through the above-mentioned routes has now ceased. France has gradually adopted an attitude of complying with Japan's fair demands. Matsuoka said that the Japanese government has been closely observing the increasingly tense and complex situation in Europe and the United States, because the actions of Western powers have a significant relationship to Japan's national policy. Finally, Matsuoka said that the impact of the development of the international situation on the commercial aspect cannot be ignored. Major changes in the economic situation are expected and must be dealt with. The Japanese government has already taken measures as needed from time to time. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

### Stabilizing Prices: Various Parties Are Working Hard; Procurement and Sales Can Be Divided into Two Parts: Stepping Up Internal Transportation and Increasing Local Products

Chongqing Stabilizing prices is the central task of various economic departments and municipal authorities at present. All parties are currently working hard to carry it out. Procurement and sales work is being actively developed. Subsidized rice and coal have been on sale for many days, and it is heard that a large number of daily necessities will be distributed to various supply points and cooperatives within a few days. In the future, procurement and sales work will be divided into two parts: one is to step up the internal transportation of necessities, and the other is to increase local products. In addition, the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, in view of the importance of the price issue, has specially organized a wartime price survey to compile statistics for use by all parties.

### Struggle for the Gateway to the Lower Red Sea: British and Italian Forces Engage in Fierce Fighting; Both Sides' Air Forces Active, Bombing Each Other; Italian Forces Advance Towards Perim, Encountering Resistance

Cairo The Gulf of Aden, overlooking the lower Red Sea, which is the lifeline of the British Empire, has become the newest battlefield. According to the announcement, two columns of Italian troops are advancing towards Perim from the land. A naval aircraft from the Australian cruiser "Hobart" dived down and dropped bombs, destroying the Italian headquarters in Zeila Harbor. It is believed that this astonishing move delayed the advance of the Italian troops along the coast to Perim. The task of advancing has now been handed over to the Fascist column, which has advanced towards Hargeisa and Odweina. These two columns must advance to their new target through the extremely difficult and desolate Sahann Mountains. At the same time, Italian warplanes fiercely bombed the British fleet in the Gulf of Aden, resulting in very little damage to the British fleet. It is reported that Italian troops are still concentrated on the Libyan-Egyptian border, but there is no action. (International News Agency dispatch, 10th)

London The Admiralty announced that on Thursday morning, a British aircraft, flying from the Australian cruiser "Hobart," launched a dive attack on the Italian headquarters established near Zeila Harbor and destroyed it, and used machine guns to strafe military targets, destroying trucks and military vehicles, and inflicting many casualties on Italian soldiers. The aircraft then safely returned to the ship. On Thursday, Italian aircraft bombed a British ship in the Gulf of Aden, but the planes flew very high, dropping bombs inaccurately and causing no damage. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

Cairo This morning, the British Air Force issued a communiqué stating that yesterday, British bombers attacked ships in Tobruk Harbor (an important Libyan naval base). A ship berthed at the pier was hit and caught fire. When the British aircraft flew more than 20 miles away, the ship was still burning. On the East African front, positions along the Hargeisa to Tug Argan highway were bombed by British aircraft, and several bombs were dropped on anti-aircraft gun positions and troops in the Karin Pass area. When British aircraft bombed Massawa, several bombs were seen falling near the pier, and buildings near an anti-aircraft gun position and air force barracks were directly hit. The enemy's anti-aircraft artillery opened fire fiercely, and enemy fighters also took off to attack, but all British aircraft returned safely to their base. Also, in another attack, a bomb fell near a floating dock. British bombers also bombed an oil depot in Madagascar, shooting down an Italian bomber. All British aircraft flew back to their bases. South African Air Force bombed the Neghelli airfield, destroying two Italian Caproni-type bombers parked on the ground, one of which caught fire and the other was blown to smithereens. Two more aircraft of the same type were damaged. In addition, bombs also hit houses and machine gun positions. Only one rear gunner on a British aircraft was injured. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

London A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that responsible officials in London stated that even if Italian troops occupy the entire British Somaliland protectorate, it would not endanger the Suez Canal or the route to India, as the Italians have failed to control the sea. If Britain continues to control the Red Sea, the Italian troops in Somaliland will eventually be isolated from Italy, and their supplies will continue to be blockaded by Britain. Even if Italian troops occupy Perim, it would not threaten Aden or blockade the Red Sea, and the British Navy would still be able to encircle Abyssinia and the Italian troops invading British Somaliland. According to military sources, Britain has no intention of abandoning Somaliland. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

### Anti-British Empire War Actually Already Begun; British Naval and Air Power Certainly Not To Be Underestimated; Reason for Germany's "Blitzkrieg" Being Delayed; Lloyd George's Eloquent Discussion of the War Situation

Former British Prime Minister during the last World War, Lloyd George, recently gave a speech, saying that Germany's blitzkrieg against Britain has not yet begun. He said, "The war in Britain has not actually yet begun, but the war for the British Empire has clearly begun. Regarding the war to conquer the British Isles, the Nazi Party has not launched any large-scale attack that could make the British Isles bow and submit. Although Nazi planes have bombed our coastal towns and sometimes even flown into the inland skies, they have not yet used their full air power to destroy our factories, railway hubs, and seaports in a wholesale manner. The Nazi attacks on our country have become more serious in both air and submarine attacks. As for the land, our means of production and people have not suffered major losses. Although the shipping industry has indeed suffered losses, they are not to a terrifying extent. The estimates broadcast by German radio stations have been carefully examined by me and are actually very ridiculous. It is clear that the Germans have not yet exerted their full strength in the naval and air aspects of this final battle against their last enemy. People generally feel that the Germans must have more sinister actions in reserve. The British people have no illusions about the future situation, and are ready to face even more terrible things than they are currently experiencing. Why has the attack that we often hear will make Britain submit been delayed? This point has been explained by German Air Minister General Goering. According to him, until now, the Nazi Party's actions have only been reconnaissance work. The German planes sent to fly around here are inspecting the reality of our country's defenses. According to Goering and his subordinates, this long delay is due to the German command's cautious attitude in preparing to launch an attack, and to prevent the German people from becoming impatient due to repeated rapid victories. They also predict that the attack to destroy the resistance of this only enemy will not be delayed any longer. The planes that the Germans are using to attack ships at sea cannot be regarded as purely reconnaissance planes. Most of these planes are bombers escorted by fighter planes. The activities of these planes can be said to be testing a new method of attack that combines fighter planes and bombers. If one considers the enemy's land and air power, one knows that the enemy's leaders have clearly not exerted their full strength to defeat us in one fell swoop. Therefore, the enemy's current actions are a threat that has not yet materialized. It is impossible to predict whether the enemy is only using this threat to coerce us into a shameful peace, but we must be prepared. Whether the enemy invades our country with all their mechanized equipment, or whether their attack is limited to air raids on our ships, warships, seaports, transportation, and factories, we have engaged in vigorous preparations to counter all kinds of enemy plans. To effectively respond to the enemy's plans mentioned above, air superiority is the only condition. Although the German air force is numerous, it does not have the advantage that our country has. Through continuous and arduous battles, British planes have become superior to enemy planes in combat, and the skills of British aviators in flying planes are also better than those of their opponents. The largest air battle in the English Channel last Tuesday has further strengthened our belief. The German air force has not yet had the necessary power to prove that the German staff's driving of planes to risk crossing the sea to invade is justified, and the British navy already has the power to defeat the invaders. This fact may also be the reason why the Germans have been slow to launch a major attack. The air battle on Thursday further made the Germans, who mistakenly believed that they were capable of overcoming all difficulties, have to reconsider their plans. However, although the Nazi Party's plan to destroy Britain has not yet been realized, the war against the British Empire has actually begun.

Italian Military Strategy Not To Be Taken Lightly

Italy has joined the attack on Britain's African empire. Judging from the operational plans they have expressed, they intend to cut the British Empire from the Mediterranean to the Equator into pieces, and reorganize an old Roman Empire in North Africa from the pieces of British and French territories. They have already occupied Kassala, the most important military location in central Sudan. They are waiting for the floodwaters to recede before advancing further to occupy the remaining rich and fertile areas. The Italians have now begun to attack British Somaliland. If this area is occupied by the Italian army, the Italian territory will be expanded to the remaining unoccupied parts of the coast of the Gulf of Aden. The Italians have also threatened the road to Kenya, and launched their attempt to annex tropical Africa. The most important thing is that the large army of Libya is threatening Egypt, a country famous in the world. Egypt is not only a famous country in history, but also has special importance because it is a strategic location connecting the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. The surrender of France was a disappointing blow to resisting this dangerous attack. France also has a large army in Tunisia and Syria. If the armies of Tunisia and Syria were to unite with the strong British garrison in Egypt and Sudan, this military force, even if not absolutely superior, could be comparable to the army that Italy could send to Africa. If Alexandria and Port Said are occupied, the British fleet in the Mediterranean will be in a dangerous position.

Spain Is Also Eager To Make A Move

Also, Fascist Spain is preparing to jump into the battlefield, and has already designated Gibraltar and French Morocco as its spoils of war. Military experts who doubt whether Germany threatens Britain believe that Germany's plan is intended to prevent Britain from sending reinforcements to the Mediterranean, so that it cannot reinforce the annexation of French territories in the continent. Germany could then send powerful tanks to assist the Italian army, but there is currently no news of this attack. Therefore, the British government is carefully engaged in strengthening its defenses and protecting its African territories. If Britain proves that its naval power is unbreakable, it will be able to adjust the situation in Africa." (Reuters, 10th)

### Pravda Observes The War Situation: Portugal Will Become A Battlefield; Relations Between Portugal and Spain Are Becoming Increasingly Close; Spain Clearly Has The Possibility Of Participating In The War

Moscow's "Pravda" published a commentary today entitled "The Struggle for Portugal's War Base," saying, "Since the outbreak of the war, Britain's political and economic position in Portugal has been greatly shaken. In view of Italy's threat and Spain's possibility of participating in the war, London has demanded that Portugal guarantee that if Spain invades Gibraltar or France, Portugal should take action against Spain. However, the Portuguese government has declared that it will maintain neutrality. Britain is trying its best to prevent the tendency of Portugal and Spain to get closer, but it knows that this work is by no means easy. On July 26, Britain signed a trade agreement with Portugal and Spain, but its purpose has still not been achieved. Spain has openly declared that it will declare war on Britain in response to the British blockade. On July 30, Spain again signed an appendix to the friendship and non-aggression treaty with Portugal. This new agreement is aimed at Britain. Therefore, Britain is in great danger of losing its last base on the European continent. Although Britain will never give up easily, from this point of view, Portugal will become an imperialist battlefield." (Tass, 9th)

Regarding the supplementary agreement recently signed between Spain and Portugal, the "German General Report" mainly stated that in view of the increasing crisis in Gibraltar, the signing of the agreement can be said to be a timely move. Portugal's foreign policy has always been pro-British. The signing of the new agreement is a revolutionary act. Both Spain and Portugal know that after Britain is forced to abandon Gibraltar, it will look for another naval base on the European continent. Britain has the possibility of occupying Lisbon or Lagos Port in Portugal. The recent increase in the garrison in Gibraltar to 15,000 people and the unloading of a large number of tanks can be used as evidence. Spain has now decided not to infringe on Portugal's territorial sovereignty. If Britain wants to occupy Portuguese seaports, Spain may use force to assist Portugal. (Haitong, 10th)

New York Many people in the United States believe that even if Hitler can defeat Britain, he may not be able to attack the United States immediately. Most people think that Germany will need at least five years to prepare for this major move. However, Professor Ulei, director of chemistry at Columbia University in New York, who discovered heavy water, believes that if Germany wins the war against Britain, the United States must face the possibility of a defensive war before the end of this summer. Ulei made this warning when announcing that 820 scientists had formed a group to promote the purpose of the Committee to Defend the Americas by Assisting the Allied Powers. Ulei said that if Germany defeats Britain, the war in Western Europe can be ended, and Hitler will then seem to quickly attack us, and take the route of Iceland and Greenland, and use Nazi forces to penetrate South America, in order to implement this move. The German army will definitely attack the defenses of the Panama Canal, or will achieve the purpose of damaging the defenses. It is reported that Ulei won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1934.

### European War True Record (5) - The Reasons for France's Defeat (Continued)

Why did France collapse? Marshal Pétain, the hero of Verdun, once saved the battle situation in the last European war with the immortal slogan "They shall not pass." Why did the Bordeaux government he leads today sign an armistice treaty with German Führer Hitler? What fate has befallen the French Republic and its great army?

The greatness and courage of France are beyond doubt. Every Frenchman, whether civilian or soldier, has long been known for their bravery in the past and in the recent series of battles. Those who have not experienced the horrors of modern warfare, such as air raids and tank attacks, are not qualified to make irresponsible criticisms. Those who have lived in France for a long time and love France should be the last to doubt the greatness of the French nation.

However, after careful study of the recent situation in France and based on seven years of experience living in France, the reporter can make the following deductions:

(1) The main reason for France's failure is the failure of its democratic political system. This is not a failure of democracy itself, nor is it a failure of the French people. It means that the French political system could not cope with the ruthless blows of dictatorial militarism in this great era of human history.

This is a problem of leadership, or rather a lack of leadership. First, there is a lack of political leaders, and second, a lack of military leaders. This is the root cause of France's decline.

Reviewing various records, we can find that in both France and Britain, many young officers had already correctly foreseen the manner of the German offensive. However, they repeatedly suggested to the British and French governments that they devise appropriate strategies to deal with this offensive. The inertia and short-sightedness of politicians in both countries made these warnings fall on deaf ears.

(2) Passively adopting the theory that France could remain safe behind the Maginot Line, and being overly rigid in adhering to the principle of defensive warfare, only demoralized the initiative and courage of most members of the French General Staff. Certain elements, even if not traitors, are guilty of ineffective combat.

(3) After the fall of Sedan, the elite French soldiers and junior officers had already felt misled by their supreme commander. Reports from all sides confirm that many French units, both large and small, were able to fight bravely, and in some places, even fought alone.

However, these reports also unanimously confirm that most French soldiers (who are all thinking people) uniformly confessed, "I have long been aware of the corruption of our French government authorities, but I still thought I could trust our generals. Now our generals have also missed the opportunity, so what's the point?"

After the Germans first broke through the lines, this kind of widespread demoralization had already spread to certain parts of the French army. This is absolutely true.

(4) In some places, the highest French authorities could not avoid missing opportunities. For example, the French army in Flanders was cut off for six days without receiving any orders from the General Headquarters. This is unbelievable, but it is true. After the Somme and Aisne lines were breached for the second time, the French General Headquarters almost completely disintegrated.

(5) The breakthrough of the French lines was the key that determined the victory or defeat of the Battle of France. All observers acknowledge the reason for this: in part, it was due to the failure to destroy the bridges over the Meuse River, which was the biggest mistake. Another part was due to the stupidity of politicians in Paris who did not understand whether the fortresses on the borders of Luxembourg and Belgium were as strong as the Maginot Line. Still another part was due to the inexcusable mistake of deploying poorly equipped second-rate troops to defend the vital areas on the Belgian-Luxembourg border.

Another reason was the numerical and equipment superiority of the German army, especially the German air force. But the main reason was that the French army was completely unprepared for the close coordination and concentrated attacks of large numbers of German tanks and large numbers of fighter-bombers. In addition to the joint offensive of huge mechanized monsters on land and in the air, the German side also had well-trained, responsive mechanized infantry, who followed up quickly to support the tank assaults. According to observers, when the French army fought, they still rigidly adhered to the orders they had been trained in. As soon as enemy planes flew over, they would lie down, take refuge in the woods, or hide behind various shelters, thinking that they could avoid bullets. Who knew that when they came out, the German tank columns had already rolled past in full force.

(6) French logic is excellent when talking about military affairs on paper, but it is absolutely unable to cope with this sudden new situation. The result is that senior officers become discouraged and disintegrated, and this situation quickly spread throughout the army.

This rigid logic of the French also led their political and military authorities to make a deduction: since the front line has been breached and the army has disintegrated, victory is impossible, and France has no hope of winning. Logically speaking, France can only request an armistice.

Under the same circumstances, the British, who value instinct over logic, would first of all not admit the possibility of defeat, and secondly, insist that the only way out is to continue fighting.

(7) The appointment of Laval as Deputy Prime Minister by the Bordeaux government, making France's surrender, gives an unpleasant impression. Both the Foreign Minister of the Bordeaux government, Baudouin, and Laval, are staunch advocates of appeasing Italy. When Prime Minister Pétain was the ambassador to Spain, he also strongly supported Spanish leader Franco. This is not an

In short, the reason for France's defeat lies in the failure to devote all its energy to manufacturing airplanes, tanks, munitions, and other important military supplies according to the output of totalitarian countries before the outbreak of the war.

Britain's failure to counter the German mechanized forces with a better-equipped army, especially with more fighters and bombers, should undoubtedly share responsibility with France.

But the root cause of all this lies in the political turmoil in France over the years, which sometimes made it seem like a disunited country. Among the French people, the imperialists, royalists, nobles, and industrial giants have never completely lost their enormous influence. At the other extreme, there are the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, which have a great deal of latent influence in the labor movement.

The hardworking and resilient farmers of France accounted for 80% of the total French population before 1914, but by 1940, this had decreased to less than 50%. If France had not faced the threat of war in the past ten years, it might have been able to peacefully complete a revolutionary transformation. Now, in the bleak shadow of war and defeat, her greatest struggle is undoubtedly to seek revival.

### Hong Kong English Colleges to Change Academic System Next Semester; Graduation Examinations from Next Year Will No Longer Use Hong Kong University Entrance Examinations to Determine Qualifications

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The academic system of public and private English schools in Hong Kong originally stipulated that Grades 8 to 4 were primary school, Grades 3 to 1 were secondary school. After completing Grade 1, neither the Hong Kong Education Department nor the schools held graduation examinations. Students had to take the Hong Kong University Entrance Examination. Those whose scores in each subject and average score were above 40 were recognized as having completed secondary school and were allowed to enter university. Those whose scores were below 40 but above 33 were only recognized as having completed secondary school. However, the Education Department changed this system some years ago, newly stipulating that Grades 8 to 4 were primary school, Grades 3 to 2 were secondary school, and Grade 1 was university preparatory. Those who did not intend to go to university could take the Hong Kong Education Department's annual Hong Kong English Schools Secondary School Graduation Examination after completing Grade 2. Those who passed were recognized as having completed secondary school and were issued a graduation certificate by the Education Department, but could not go to university. Those who intended to go to university had to take the secondary school graduation examination and, after passing, continue studying in Grade 1 before taking the university entrance examination. This academic system has been changed for many years, and this year is also in accordance with this system. Now it is learned that the Education Department has decided to change this academic system again from the next semester, canceling Grade 1 as university preparatory and restoring the previous system of Grades 8 to 4 as primary school and Grades 3 to 1 as secondary school. Therefore, whether one intends to go to university or not, one must complete the entire curriculum from Grades 8 to 1. The Hong Kong English Schools Graduation Examination, which the Education Department has held every year, will also be discontinued from next year due to the change in the academic system.

The Hezhong Cup Charity Basketball Tournament will have two matches in Group A-1 starting at 5:30 p.m. today, with double the excitement.

### Finance: Tension Seen Again in the Foreign Exchange Market; Selling British Gold and Buying American Dollars

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation saw the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) announce its exchange rates. The British exchange rate remained unchanged, while the American exchange rate fell by 0.0625, calculated at 5.375 yuan. Other exchange rates, such as the Japanese, Dutch, and so on, were also uniformly tight. As for the domestic market situation, the tight atmosphere was acute, because the British were about to withdraw their troops stationed in China, causing unease in the market. It was also heard that a certain major bank in the city was experiencing a run on deposits, so the black market suddenly saw selling of British currency and buying of American currency. Therefore, the price of American currency was the tightest. The spot price of 5.375 yuan was difficult to settle. Sassoon and others sold at one point, and speculators also slightly liquidated, causing the rate to harden. But by noon, the market was still tight. The closing price of British gold was 3 shillings 7.03125, and the American exchange rate was 5.40625 yuan, a slight decrease of 0.03125 from the previous day for the British currency and a decrease of 0.125 for the American currency. Futures were especially popular, so they diverged slightly from spot rates. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Tight American Exchange Rate

At the beginning of the morning, the London large bar was close, falling by 1.875. The New York silver price remained flat, and the London gold price was fixed. The exchange rate of British currency against American currency was unchanged, and the rate against Shanghai was also flat. There was no market for the French currency. The American rate was up 6.5 points against the British rate, flat against the Shanghai rate, and no market for the French currency. The Central Bank's exchange rates were the same as before. Banks opened in the morning with a spot selling price of 3 shillings 6.875 for British gold and 5.4375 yuan for American currency, a sharp increase of 0.046875 for British gold and a sharp decrease of 0.09375 for American currency compared to the previous day's closing. At the same time, futures opened, uniformly softening. This was because the news of the British withdrawal of troops stationed in China had already been reported, and people felt quite uneasy. The market opened tight. Japanese banks first bought the American exchange rate at 5.40625 yuan, and then Chinese speculators came to buy unanimously. It was also heard that a certain major bank was experiencing a run on deposits, with many withdrawing funds to buy American currency. Speculators entered foreign banks, buying the American exchange rate for August at 5.40625 to 5.375 yuan, and the American exchange rate for September at 5.375 and 5.3125 yuan. The HSBC exchange rate was announced, the British exchange rate remaining flat, and the American exchange rate was revised to 5.375 yuan, a tightening of 0.0625. The White Silver Equalization Tax was announced, with no increase or decrease. Afterwards, the market stabilized. It is calculated that Hong Kong Electric Sassoon slightly sold to foreign banks, with the spot rate being 3 shillings 7.1875. The Banque de l'Indochine also sold the American exchange rate for September at 5.34375 yuan. Speculators then re-emerged, buying the American exchange rate for August at 5.46875 yuan, but speculators soon came to buy and settle, buying the American exchange rate for August at 5.375 yuan and September at 5.3125 yuan. Small private banks bought US dollars from American banks at a price of 5.375 yuan. There were few changes before the close of the market. The underlying trend was still popular for the American exchange rate. As a result, British gold was 3 shillings 7.03125, and the American exchange rate was 5.40625 yuan. The August British exchange rate was the same as the spot rate, and the American exchange rate was 5.34375 yuan. The September British gold was 3 shillings 6.875, and the American exchange rate was 5.28125 yuan, a decrease of 0.125 for the spot American exchange rate and a decrease of 0.031225 for British gold compared to the previous day. The August and September American exchange rates were both tighter by 0.1875. The British gold September slightly decreased by 0.015625. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

American Exchange Rate Tight in Hong Kong

### British Troop Withdrawal from China Sparks a Gold Rush, Reaching a Peak of $5,870

Yesterday, the unofficial cash gold market was extremely active, with prices soaring to nearly $5,900. This was attributed to the impending withdrawal of British troops from China, creating an unstable political situation. While the future is uncertain, the exchange rate is tightening, and rumors of certain local banks resuming withdrawals in U.S. dollars have fueled demand. Consequently, the number of gold buyers has increased significantly. The market opened at $5,780, a $95 increase from the previous day. Initially, gold dealers sold, causing a $30 drop. However, the foreign exchange market tightened sharply, and gold dealers pushed the price up to $5,830. Although the exchange rate slightly hardened and local speculators took profits, pulling the price back to $5,780, the exchange rate soon softened again, prompting securities firms and others to aggressively buy, driving the price to a new high of $5,870. Ultimately, due to increased selling by smaller investors, the market closed at $5,840, up $155 from the previous day. In the afternoon, the market was closed for Saturday, but small transactions occurred outside the market at around $5,805, with the final price at $5,820. Total trading volume for the half-day was nearly 2,000 taels. Jewelry stores raised their gold prices by $10, while customs gold prices remained stable.

Cash Gold Up $155

Since morning, the exchange rate has been the main focus, boosting morale. The market opened with a buying frenzy, pushing the price up by $15. Silver firms and gold dealers bought 50 taels at $5,780. Subsequently, due to selling by gold dealers and money changers, the price fell slightly by $30. A gold dealer sold 10 taels to a silver firm, lowering the price to $5,750. Then, securities firms and silver firms suddenly started buying aggressively, and a certain gold dealer followed suit. Before long, the price was pushed up by $80. A silver firm bought 10 taels from a gold dealer, raising the price to $5,830. However, due to the exchange rate hardening, the buying frenzy subsided. Smaller investors took profits, and a major long-term investor started selling, while a money changer continued to sell occasionally. The price retreated to $5,780. Afterward, the foreign exchange market tightened again, and gold and silver firms competed to buy. Soon, a certain money changer switched from selling to buying, and securities firms were also aggressively buying. This drove the price up to $5,870. However, trading volume was limited, and the buying frenzy weakened slightly. Securities firms turned from buying to selling, so the market closed at $5,840, up $155 from the previous day. The fluctuation range for the half-day was $120. The selling price of cash gold by cash gold firms was over ten dollars higher than the listed price, while the buying price was thirty dollars lower. The current spot gold price was over fifty dollars lower than the listed gold price, but there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Prices Remain High at $600

The selling price of gold jewelry by major jewelry stores initially remained at $590 per tael. Then, at 10:30, it was raised by ten dollars. Since then there have been no changes, with major stores setting it at $600. The prices of new stores were the same as the previous prices, with buying prices about thirty dollars lower.

### Foreign Currency Surges

Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw significant increases. Cash gold surged, and British and American gold pounds also rose by $3 each. Demand for British gold notes remained strong, and the market price continued to rise by 20 cents. The U.S. dollar briefly soared to $18.75, but the release of some cash by American banks eased market sentiment. The final price was $18.60, still a sharp increase of 45 cents from the previous day. Hong Kong notes also rose to $4.04. Singapore, Annam, Rupee, Canadian, and Philippine notes all trended upwards. Demand for Japanese gold notes remained strong, and the evening market continued to rise to $1.1365. Korean rice retreated instead of advancing, falling to $1.07 yesterday.

### Securities: "Tong Jia" Shares Down $1.50

In the unofficial securities market, the drawing of lots for Category A shares took place yesterday. Unexpected changes in the environment, including rising gold prices and a tightening exchange rate, led to a decline in the bond market. The Category A shares, excluding the right to draw lots, fell by $1.50 compared to the previous day. In reality, the amount that should have been deducted for the right to draw lots was only $0.80 to $1.00. However, market sentiment was slightly weak, so the price fell more than expected. In the morning, Hongda, Wankang, and Hengfu shares were sold, while Jiufeng and Lianhe covered short positions, and Xinfu bought a significant amount, causing the market price to fall by $0.30 to $0.40. In the afternoon, trading cleared, and Category C and B shares rebounded slightly. Category A shares continued to be sold and fell slightly by another $0.05. Overall, the market rebounded slightly by $0.15 to $0.35, with Category A shares of China Railway down $1.50. Total trading volume was approximately $600,000. A summary table is provided below.

Stock trading: 50 shares of China National Goods Company were traded at a price of $25.75.

London, September 9 (Friday) report: Today's listed prices for Chinese external prices and Far Eastern British-owned company stocks remained stable, with only HSBC Bank shares fluctuating by £1. Shares registered in the UK continued to fall by £1, with a price of £61. Shares registered in Hong Kong rose by £1, with a price of £67. All others remained unchanged.

### Food: Rice Prices Fluctuate; Another 5,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive

Yesterday, the foreign rice market suddenly showed a fluctuating situation. In the morning, both buyers and sellers were hesitant, and there were few transactions, remaining stable. At midday, news of rising gold prices and a tightening exchange rate spread, and short sellers took the opportunity to cover their positions, while speculators and retail investors absorbed the supply. Local stores also added to the activity. In an instant, buying interest was strong, and prices rose by about $1.50. Number One Chen Saigon was priced at $59.50, Number Two at $55, Number Two Siam at $54.50, and Fire Grain at $58.50, Small Jia at $54.50. At this point, buying and selling were mixed, and the market became volatile. Afterward, those who had made profits rushed to sell at high prices, and with abundant supply, the market gradually calmed down. By afternoon, the market had softened again, and prices fell back down. As a result, the closing prices were slightly higher than before, with Number One Chen Saigon at $58.50, Number Two at $54, Number Two Siam at $53, and Fire Grain at $57. In the recycled original bags, early market expectations of a tightening exchange rate and rising gold prices pushed up prices, with Number Two Saigon opening at $64.50, a premium of over half a dollar, then rising to $64.50, a dollar more than the previous day's price of $63.50. However, due to weak actual sales and speculators observing, the endless supply of foreign rice resulted in warehouse stocks exceeding 800,000 bags, while customer sales remained absent. Sellers inevitably felt uneasy, and retail speculators who had already made profits sought to exit. As a result, Number Two Saigon suddenly fell by $1 in the afternoon, returning to the original price of $63.50. Number Two Siam also opened at $64 and rose to $64.50, an increase of a dollar, but fell back to $63.80 in the afternoon, a gain of only $0.30. However, buying and selling were both active, with about 500 tons of original bags traded. There were also pillow-like transactions in the current rice market, with 7,000 to 8,000 bags traded.

Another shipment of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. The French company's "Kindia" ship, directly loaded with 5,000 bags of foreign rice from West Africa, arrived yesterday afternoon and berthed at piers 18 and 19 for unloading. (Translator)

The source of thick and thin "Jing" rice and other domestic rice continued to be interrupted, leading to a rise in prices in the unofficial market. Transactions were frequent, and prices rose by nearly a dollar. High-quality special fresh "Qing Jing" rice from local producers returned to the $70 mark, with special "Jing" at $68-69, "Wuxi Qing Jing" at $68 and $67, and "Changzhou Su Kun Jing" at $66-67. Lower quality rice from Suqian was at $64. Thin rice remained unavailable due to lack of supply. Fresh early rice from Nangang original bags was at $65-66, rice from Suqian at $61-62, and fresh rice from Hukou was at $63.

New "Jing" rice from Zhoupu continued to be scarce due to transportation difficulties. Only about 20 "dan" (a unit of weight) arrived, but demand was high due to the season, making it a popular product. This created an imbalance between supply and demand, making the market exceptionally tight, opening at $63.50, up half a dollar from before.

### Active Flour Sales

Yesterday's flour trade was brisk for both local and outside buyers. In addition to zero-lot sales of "Old Vehicle" and "Fuxin" brand flour, the local market gradually adopted "Phoenix" brand Japanese flour. Recently, North China traders have been very active in moving Japanese flour due to its convenient transport and lower prices compared to factory flour. This situation has led to increased sales and rising prices for the Japanese flour. Yesterday, the August price for "Phoenix" flour opened at $14.65, and the September price at $14.75, up $0.15 from the previous day, and a total increase of $0.60-0.70 in three days. However, the factory prices for Chinese flour remained the same, while the output from various factories declined due to disruptions in raw material supply, leading to a smaller supply and higher prices for "recycled" flour compared to factory flour by $0.20.

The wheat market also improved yesterday due to increased purchases by Japanese factories, especially the Sanxin Factory, which produced more Phoenix flour and needed the most wheat. Yesterday, 6,000 bags of Beijing and Wu wheat were purchased at $19.50 to $19, still being evaluated. Chinese factories still only bought small quantities at prices that have quietly increased by $0.50 to $0.60.

### Yarn and Cotton: Deteriorating Conditions, Unstable Yarn Prices, "Double Horse" Drops Another $21, Market Closed for the Next Two Days

The yarn market continued to decline, and the trend was very weak. This was because the actual situation had made little progress, and at the same time, the environment was unfavorable. Therefore, although the foreign exchange shrinkage was severe and gold prices rose sharply, it failed to stimulate the market. The yarn market could not prosper as a result. Furthermore, the factory sold a large number of factory orders in the past, resulting in a glut of goods on the market, temporarily suppressing prices. Most investors must watch the $950 mark, fearing a breakthrough before taking any action.

The current yarn market opened with the expectation of further exchange rate declines, but there were still many buyers. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was $1,000, $10 higher than the previous day. However, after trading began, selling pressure increased sharply, and there were few buyers. In addition, speculators, sensing unfavorable conditions, rushed to sell, and the market was unable to sustain and fell step by step to $975. This was because the market would be closed for two days starting tomorrow, due to the August 13th anniversary, and would reopen on the 14th. Speculators with no ability to buy wanted to settle their positions, causing market weakness. After the close, the market rebounded. According to half-day statistics, 1,910 bales were traded. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn fell $21. Today, 265 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The following is the amount purchased by each group:

### Cotton Relies on Local Trading

The current cotton trade remained sluggish, and factory purchases were particularly slow. However, due to the exchange rate tightening, local firms traded with each other, providing some activity. As for the factory side, the price of yarn not only failed to rise but declined. The current cotton transaction situation is on the left:

In other news, the market price of foreign cotton in New York was weak. The selling by cash merchants resulted in very sluggish results. Closing prices were down four points for near-term contracts compared to the previous day, and Indian cotton prices were down four rupees.

The exchange rate in Shanghai's foreign cotton market tightened, but yarn prices fell, so the cotton market showed no improvement. The prices of foreign firms were calculated based on the exchange rate. The difference between the previous two days was an increase of over $10 per "dan" for American cotton. Overall trading was exceptionally quiet.

### Piece Goods: Domestically Sold Cotton Cloth Imported from Aojiang

The domestic cloth market was firm, because current sales from all routes were good. The "Changde" ship sailed from Zhejiang's Aojiang, and imported safely. Business from Wenzhou was continuous, and it is hoped that customer demand will increase. But because raw yarn was weak, speculator confidence declined slightly, and selling was stable. Some hand goods were discounted by $0.10 to $0.25 per piece. Over 500 pieces of various goods were traded in the local market. Demand for bleached and dyed grey fabrics was relatively strong. Over 300 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and coarse cloth were traded by Zhejiang merchants, over 200 pieces of twill, fine cloth, and colored cloth by Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants, and over 200 pieces of colored cloth and coarse cloth by Yantai and Tianjin merchants. 5,000+ pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, poplin, and colored cloth from Siam and other places were traded.

The Eastern cloth market continued to rise. Active sales of colored cloth and colored twill, as well as white goods and dyed greige fabric, resulted in the local market being elevated. Fine cloth and fine twill increased by $0.25 to $0.50 per piece. The market for "Dragon Head" fine cloth was elevated by the enthusiasm of the trade. It opened at $33.40, dropped to $33, and then reached a high of $33.70, closing at $33.45. The price of "Four Gentlemen" serge fluctuated between $0.95, but the trend remained strong.

Yesterday, 200 pieces of piece goods were exported to Hong Kong, 75 pieces to Siam, 750 pieces to Yantai, and 60 pieces to Tianjin. Today, 210 pieces are being shipped to Hong Kong and 65 pieces to Singapore.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Broad Bean Market Booming

The source of broad beans was inconsistent and irregular, so the market fluctuated greatly. Recently, the supply has become scarce, while sales have been brisk.

Yesterday, the traders opened with 18 bags of "Jiangbei Kaiyang" (dried shrimp) at $225. Several boxes of "Yantai Longxudao" tail shrimp arrived, asking $330, but were not sold. The trend is unlikely to be too low.

### Medicinal Materials: New Lily Bulbs En Route, Production Prices Up Nearly a Dollar

The new lily bulb season has begun in the production area for several days. Due to transportation difficulties, little has arrived in Shanghai. Because the Shanghai market's old stocks are tight, production prices have also risen. It is said that prices have risen by nearly $10, and goods are already en route and should arrive in Shanghai soon.

### Northern and Southern Goods: Orchid Bamboo Branches Arriving Soon

New orchid bamboo branches have been on the market in the production area for some time. Due to shipping disruptions between Zhangzhou and Gulangyu, they have not been transported to Shanghai. According to a letter from customers, transportation between Zhangzhou and Gulangyu resumed on the 1st of this month. Priority has been given to the transportation of essential firewood, so miscellaneous goods will be delayed. It is expected that they may arrive in Shanghai next week.

### Wood Ear and Golden Needles: One Up, One Down

The source of black wood ear is currently disrupted, and the arrival of goods is not smooth. However, sales to the Southeast Asian community are quite active, so the price has risen sharply.

Tianjin merchants have already been inquiring about various goods, and large mouth tinplate is one of them. The market for tinplate is good, due to limited supply. For example, 24-gauge is selling for $1,100, and 26-gauge is selling for about $550 per box.

### British Withdrawal of Shanghai Garrison - Indicates Sale of Far East Military Strength - Rumor Says Defense Zone Left Behind to be Taken Over by US Military - Foreign Defense Forces to Confer Next Week

Since the British military authorities in London and Shanghai announced the withdrawal of their garrisons in North China and Shanghai for redeployment elsewhere, it has caused a profound reaction among Chinese and foreign residents throughout the city. The position of the concessions is currently precarious, and the political situation is volatile and unpredictable. The British troops’ departure at this time cannot fail to stir emotions. General speculation about the purpose of the British withdrawal centers around two possibilities: either to relocate troops to the south as a silent response to Japan's southward ambitions, or as an implicit gesture of appeasement towards Japan. If it is the latter, it would be tantamount to Britain declaring its withdrawal from the Far East and abandoning its deeply rooted, extensive, and formidable power. Britain would not be so unwise as to do this. Moreover, Britain has notified the Japanese side, stating that it reserves the rights granted by the final protocol signed in Beijing on September 7, 1910. If it is the former, it clearly indicates that Britain's attitude towards Japan will become more proactive. According to news from London, this move is to strengthen the actual strength of the British forces in the Far East. If so, the troop relocation is of great significance. As for the issue of who will take over the defense zone after the British troops' withdrawal, there is a widespread hope that it can be taken over by the US military. Although the US authorities in Shanghai have stated that it must be decided by Washington, the British withdrawal was tacitly approved by the US. There is a great possibility that the US military will take over the defense, which would simplify and stabilize the situation in the concessions. The details are as follows:

Unified Concern Among Chinese and Foreign People

Since London issued the order to prepare for the withdrawal of the British defense forces from Shanghai, people in Shanghai have been very concerned. Whether on trams, buses, shops, or offices, all public places are discussing this matter. General commentators believe that, given the recent political developments that have put the Public Concession in a delicate position, Britain's sudden decision to withdraw its defense forces is an unwise move.

No Abandonment of Rights and Interests in China

According to a British diplomatic source yesterday, the British move is purely based on a measure taken for its overall situation. It is a misunderstanding to think that this move means that Britain will abandon its rights and interests and position in China. Britain's rights and interests in China are substantial, and it will not easily abandon them. Regarding who will take over the British military defense zone in Shanghai after the British withdrawal, the source said that he did not know yet, but it should be clear soon. When asked about the impact of the British troop withdrawal on the situation in the Public Concession, he could not comment but stated that Britain would continue to closely monitor the situation in the Shanghai Public Concession and would not change its previous attitude.

Meeting of Three Countries' Military Officers Yesterday

According to reliable sources, an important meeting was held at the British military headquarters on Rue Dufour (now North Shaanxi Road) at 11:00 AM yesterday. Military officials from the US defense forces and the Japanese army visited Major General Simmons, the British military commander, one after another. It is widely believed that the military leaders of the US, Britain, and Japan conducted a preliminary discussion on the issue of taking over the defense zone after the British withdrawal. According to inquiries with other relevant parties, senior military officers from the US and Japan visited British military commander Major General Simmons at 10:00 AM yesterday morning to inquire about the British troop withdrawal and not to hold a meeting.

Foreign Defense Forces to Meet Next Week

According to the English-language "China Press", after the British announcement of their withdrawal from Shanghai, it is expected that the commanders of the foreign defense forces stationed in Shanghai will hold a meeting early next week to revise the defense zones of the various military forces in the Public Concession. The British military headquarters in Shanghai recently issued a notice stating that all outstanding debts of the British troops stationed in Shanghai should be settled within one week. Therefore, it is expected that the British troops will leave Shanghai next week. News was received in Shanghai this morning that the British War Office announced the withdrawal of the West Yorkshire Regiment and the East Surrey Regiment, which caused quite a shock, as British troops have been stationed in Shanghai along with troops from other countries since 1927.

Normal Defense Duties Before Withdrawal

A spokesman for the British troops stationed in Shanghai told reporters this morning that the exact date of the withdrawal of the two British battalions from Shanghai has not yet been announced. However, at present, British troops will continue to perform their duties and be stationed in their respective defense zones as usual. The British troop withdrawal is a "natural action" in the current European war.

Italian Troops to Remain in Shanghai for Now

According to British Consul-General in Shanghai, George, he has already responded to the request of "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an to withdraw the troops of the warring nations stationed in Shanghai. He has not yet informed Fu of this decision by the British War Office. However, when the official date of the British troops' departure is announced, he may formally notify Fu. This morning, reporters asked Lieutenant Colonel Morante, commander of the Italian Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, whether the approximately 300 Italian troops stationed in Shanghai would also leave Shanghai soon. He replied that he had not received any instructions from his superiors, so the Italian troops would remain for the time being.

Volunteer Corps and Russian Troops to Take Over Hongkou

Regarding the redeployment, it is rumored that after the British troops leave Shanghai, the western Hongkou defense zone guarded by the British soldiers of the West Yorkshire Regiment will be taken over by the Volunteer Corps and the Russian Detachment. The defense duties in the area along the Shanghai-West Railway, within the vicinity of the Western District, along Avenue du President Doumer and Avenue Joffre, currently guarded by the British soldiers of the East Surrey Regiment, will continue to change.

US Military to Take Over Shanghai West Area

Rumors say that the defense along the Shanghai west border will be taken over by the US 4th Marine Regiment. However, this has not been confirmed, and US Marine Corps officers have refused to make any comments. As for how the US military will be assigned to defense duties in the Public Concession, it will be decided by Colonel Baker, commander of the US Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai. This morning, the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government" did not criticize the British troop withdrawal from Shanghai. Officials from the US and Japanese consulates in Shanghai also declined to comment.

Japanese Side Believes it is an Opportunity

Only the Japanese side said that the spokesperson of the Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo may issue a statement today. Furthermore, the Japanese-language "Continental News" published in Shanghai this morning stated that after the withdrawal of the British troops stationed in Shanghai and North China, the British defense zone in Shanghai should be transferred to the Japanese authorities. Judging from the current "real situation here," there is no problem with this move. As the European situation becomes increasingly critical, Britain is forced to drastically change its Far East policy. Regardless of the reasons for the British troop withdrawal, one thing is certain: the British authorities have accepted the Japanese demand that the European warring nations withdraw their armed forces stationed in the occupied areas of China to avoid unforeseen events.

Investigation of British Military Units in Shanghai

According to the "North-China Daily News", Major General Simmons, the commander of the British forces in China, officially announced last night (9th) that the British forces currently stationed in Shanghai and North China would be withdrawn. The British troops withdrawing from Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing in accordance with this order include: (1) the 2nd Battalion of the East Surrey Regiment, the regular battalion currently stationed in Shanghai; (2) the 1st Battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment, normally stationed in Hong Kong and currently temporarily stationed here; (3) a detachment of the Army Medical Corps, with its headquarters currently located at the British Military Hospital on Central Road; (4) a detachment of the Army Service Corps, with its headquarters located at the Auching Barracks; (5) several detachments of engineers, signal corps, military police, and staff corps, with their headquarters located at the Duffour Road Barracks; (6) the Army Pay Corps and the Dental Corps.

Nursing Section Also Currently in Shanghai

A British military officer replied to reporters last night that he had no further comments to add to Major General Simmons's announcement. It is reported that the British troops in North China who are about to withdraw from Tianjin and Beijing are part of the 2nd Battalion of the East Surrey Regiment. After the departure of the Douchant Light Infantry, which was previously stationed in North China, the number of British troops in the area was reduced. Later, a company of the East Surrey Regiment was sent to take over the defense. In addition, there is a part of the affiliated military nursing team, which is also currently stationed in Shanghai.

First Withdrawal in Thirteen Years

After the British troops leave Shanghai this time, it will be the first time since 1927 that there will be no regular British troops stationed in Shanghai. Before 1927, with the exception of the Boxer Rebellion and the Taiping Rebellion, Shanghai did not have British troops stationed for a long time. Famous British regiments that have been stationed in Shanghai in the past include the Coldstream Guards and the Scots Guards. Many of them later served in the Shanghai Municipal Police.

Officers Stationed in Shanghai are Renowned

General Lord Gort, who was the commander of the British Expeditionary Force during the Battle of Flanders in the current European war and is now the Inspector General of Military Training, was stationed in Shanghai in 1927 and served as the chief of staff to General Duncan, commander of the British Sherwood Foresters. Captain Ivan Andrews, who was awarded the Victoria Cross for his meritorious service during the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk, also served in Shanghai with the East Lancashire Regiment. The current commander of the East Surrey Regiment stationed in Shanghai is Lieutenant Colonel Swinton, and the commander of the West Yorkshire Regiment is Lieutenant Colonel Mawley. Major General Simmons was originally the commander of the British forces in Palestine and was transferred to become the commander of the British forces in China, succeeding Major General Smirles, who was transferred to become the Governor of Guernsey (which is currently occupied by German forces).

Strengthening the Strength of British Forces in the Far East

According to news from London, the British troops who are about to withdraw from Shanghai and North China will be used to strengthen the strength of other British forces stationed in the Far East. The British troops stationed in Shanghai are skilled in various sports and proficient in soccer and hockey.

Original Defense Zones of Various Foreign Forces

The area of the extended road construction southwest of Avenue Joffre, south of Suzhou Creek, east of Avenue du President Doumer, north of Lujiazhai Road, and west of Edinburgh Road is the British military area. The area of the Public Concession west of Yu Qiaqing Road, east of Jiaozhou Road, Hart Road, and Avenue Joffre is the US military area.

### Changde Steamer Released - Arrives at Gulong - Moufu and Hana to Sail to Gulong Soon

The Italian merchant ship Changde, belonging to the Rowbotham trading company, loaded cargo and set sail from Shanghai on the 7th of this month, heading for Gulong. Due to the small size of the ship, it sailed close to the coast, and mistakenly entered the Japanese naval warning line in the Dazhiyang area, resulting in its detention by a Japanese warship. This situation was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The ship has now been released and arrived at Gulong yesterday morning. As for the Fuxing small steamer, which was detained and taken to Songdou at the same time, there is no news yet as to whether it has been released.

It is scheduled to sail there on the 12th (Monday) to load cargo, and has already handled customs clearance procedures at the Jianghai Customs. The customs clearance destination is only Gulong River, but the onshore inspection there is very strict. The Lihe Company's shipping department has announced that all purchasers of Moufu steamer tickets must bring appropriate surety documents in order to purchase tickets. In addition, the German Far East Company's Hana steamer, which was originally scheduled to sail to Gulong River yesterday morning, has been postponed to 8:00 AM this morning due to various procedures not being completed in time.

As for receiving urgent telegrams from the French government, he said that he had no knowledge of it.

At 5:00 AM on the 9th, large numbers of laborers were assigned to build multiple sandbag fortifications (semi-circular) in front of the Shen Bao newspaper office on Shandong Road and Hankou Road, the Thames newspaper office on Avenue Edward VII, the Great Evening News newspaper office, the Sino-American Daily News newspaper office, the lane entrance of the Sino-American Daily News printing house in Changgeng Lane on Avenue Edward VII, and in front of the North-China Daily News newspaper office on the Bund, under the supervision of police officers.

### Rumors Say Japan Will Lift Some Restrictions on Coastal Shipping - But Some Say Shimada Issued a Declaration Yesterday, Expanding the Blockade of the Fujian Coast

According to the "North-China Daily News", shipping circles claimed yesterday (9th) that the Japanese naval authorities may lift some of the restrictions imposed on Chinese coastal shipping within two weeks. It is reported that the Japanese side implemented this ban on July 16, completely blocking Chinese coastal shipping, except for the direct routes between North China ports and Hong Kong and Shanghai. Those operating on these two routes are ships of large shipping companies, so small companies have actually ceased operations.

Part of Military Operations Completed

The Japanese authorities explained that this ban was necessary for military reasons, and that the navy was concentrating its actions on ports such as Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Zhenhai. It was learned yesterday that military operations in some ports have now been completed, so the ban may be lifted sooner.

Merchants Have Suffered Huge Losses

The losses suffered by shipping companies are insignificant compared to the Chinese merchant food stores in Shanghai that sell local products from coastal ports. The Shaoxing wine, Chen wine, Wenzhou ham, and fruits from various ports in South China stored in Shanghai are gradually decreasing and cannot be replenished.

Some Say the Fujian Coast is Expanded Blockade

According to another report, Vice Admiral Shimada Shigeru, commander-in-chief of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, issued a declaration at noon on August 10, expanding the blockade of the Fujian coast. Based on the needs of combat operations, a declaration was issued on July 15 prohibiting ships from sailing in many places along the Zhejiang and Fujian coasts (including ships of third countries). Now, navigation is further prohibited in the following locations on the Fujian coast, starting from 00:00 on August 15: The area from Kere Island and Chimmo Point on the Fujian coast, through Highcone, Pinghai, Dazuo Cape, to the Shenhu line, including Xinghua Bay, Pinghai Bay, Meizhou Port, Xipu, Quanzhou Port, Shenhu Port, and other sea areas.

Shanghai Shipping Companies Have Not Received Confirmation

However, Jardine Matheson & Co. has learned that the company has not received this news. However, the company's Shenhua and Shenyou steamers, which sailed from Shanghai to Fujian in early August, arrived at Sanjiangkou in Xinghua. It was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai immediately, but there is still no news of their departure. It is still difficult to know whether we are being blocked from coming to Shanghai. The blockade line announced by the Japanese this time is: (1) From Hushan in Hangzhou Bay to the vertical line of Shenjiamen to the Feishan Islands to Juexi in Xiangshan Port, the blockade line is for the Zhenhai Port area; (2) From Yueqing to Qianshan to Pingyang and above, the blockade line is for the Ou River Estuary area. The blocked area is very wide. For example, the Zhejiang East Longshan, Xiepu, Ligang, Zhenhai, Daxie Mountain, Chuanshan, Cengang, Xiangshan Port, Hangzhou Bay, and Liuheng Mountain are all blocked. The purpose is obviously to block shipping.

### Starting This Morning, Security Measures are Tightened - Police Guard the Security of the Concessions - Military Police and Teams Throughout the City are Deployed for Defense - Traffic Restrictions are More Severe Than Last Year - Japanese Military Live Fire Drills, Citizens Need Not Panic

Yesterday was the second day of the implementation of security measures by the police authorities around the third anniversary of the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle. The foreign defense forces, Volunteer Corps, White Russian Detachment, and special constables worked together with the police to maintain order. Since last night, the Public Concession has deployed more patrolmen to perform duties within the concession. In addition to the full mobilization of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps and the White Russian Detachment, various defensive measures are still being actively deployed. It is said that the security situation will become even more stringent starting today. It is understood that only a small portion of the defense forces and Volunteer Corps participated in the security measures in the past two days. The members of the various units that were called up, such as the Chinese company of the regiment, concentrated at the Volunteer Corps barracks in the Municipal Council Building. A Battalion concentrated in the racetrack, and B Battalion concentrated at the Shanghai Club. However, starting at 5:00 AM this morning, all armed members waiting for orders will be deployed for defense, and it has been decided to rotate the defense forces every two hours. The number of British, American, French, and Italian defense forces deployed will also be increased compared to the past two days. More troops will also be stationed at the road intersections of all key points within the border to strengthen security.

Cutting off Traffic

Yesterday, barriers were set up to block traffic on various unimportant roads such as Avenue Edward VII, Chongqing Road, and Chengdu Road. Iron barbed wire fences and patrol vehicles were set up at various passages along Yu Qiaqing Road, such as the British Concession Sichuan Road and Sanmaoge Bridge. A large number of Chinese and foreign detectives were stationed to inspect pedestrians. In the French Concession, barricades and tanks were also set up on Avenue Foch, Dongxinqiao, Xinbeimen, Rue du Consulat, and the Bund, and armed detectives were stationed. Traffic was cut off at the Big Clock Tower. The foreign defense forces also continued to be deployed, patrolling the streets in armored vehicles or on foot. These strict security measures will be lifted before the morning of the 14th, but may be extended if deemed necessary to maintain security.

Security in Shanghai West

In order to maintain the security of the "August 13th" anniversary, the Public Concession authorities have taken more comprehensive security measures in the Shanghai West area, which is considered to be a hotbed of crime. According to the results of an inspection by a Daguan News Agency reporter who took a car to the area yesterday, iron barbed wire fences have been set up at the intersections of Daxi Road, Dufour Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Avenue Haig, Connaught Road, and Jiaozhou Road. Many detectives were stationed next to the fences, and they strictly searched pedestrians. Six or seven Italian defense forces soldiers were also standing on both sides with guns. At the same time, there were defense force gun vehicles patrolling back and forth, and the security was very tight.

Japanese Military Exercises

The Japanese Naval Landing Force stationed in Shanghai, on the occasion of the upcoming anniversary of the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle, conducted security exercises in the area north of Suzhou Creek, west of the north-south livestock market, south of the east-west Xuejiazhuang line, and east of the north-south mint starting last night (10th). They fired blanks starting at 0:00 this morning, and did not stop until dawn. The Japanese side had notified the surrounding residents in advance that they were not allowed to enter the area near the exercise site. At the railway gates in the Nanshi area, the barbed wire entrances in Zhabei and Hongkou, and the wharves in Pudong and the west of the South Huangpu and Suzhou Creek, the number of Japanese military police has been increased from four to eleven or twelve. Before trains arrive at the station or are about to depart, armored vehicles (ten people per vehicle) are dispatched with machine guns to patrol in front.

### After Efforts by the Shanghai Municipal Council, Flour Prices Fall - Supply Gradually Becomes Abundant and Panic is Reduced - Hope for Verification and Reporting of Hoarding and Speculation

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Price Investigation Office recently issued its second public announcement, stating that among the various issues handled by the office since the publication of the first public announcement, the most important one was domestic flour. The office has no control over various aspects of transporting domestic wheat to Shanghai, so the supply of wheat was abnormal. As a result, most of the major flour mills in the concessions reduced production. The price of flour, which had hovered around 14 yuan per bag, rose to 15.8 yuan per bag, and the prices varied. Most bakeries also found it difficult to purchase flour.

Improving the Flour Market

In order to prevent hoarding and prevent further price increases, the office once cooperated with various flour mills and wholesale merchants to discuss ways to supply legitimate needs, and the selling price should not exceed 15.5 yuan per bag. This was quite effective. However, by mid-July, there was a serious shortage of flour. Although bakeries paid a price of 16 to 16.3 yuan per bag, they only obtained half of their daily needs. The office consulted again, and as a result, the flour market, which had once experienced extreme panic, was greatly improved. Currently, domestic wheat is being transported to Shanghai again, and the price is also cheaper. The price of flour has also fallen to 15 yuan per bag, and it is expected to continue to decline in the future.

### Worker Living Expenses Index for July This Year

Due to military operations in Zhejiang and Fujian, the blockade of the Yunnan-Vietnam and Yunnan-Burma highways, restrictions on imports in the Nanyang region, and the shrinking market for Shanghai-produced goods, on the one hand, prices in the city are falling. On the other hand, the prices of daily necessities transported to Shanghai from the aforementioned areas are also affected. Since the speculative frenzy in May, Shanghai's industry has shifted from abnormal prosperity to a period of decline. However, the increase in retail prices continues unabated, becoming unbearable for the average citizen. With fewer outlets for manufactured goods and rising retail prices, the result is a sharp decline in sales of general merchandise. This trend is expected to continue or even worsen in the coming days.

The following table compares the average prices of five categories and fifty-eight items in July with the previous month and calculates the percentage increase or decrease:

Shanghai Worker Living Expenses Index for July, Year 29

New Base Period: Average of 1936 (Republic Year 25) equals 100

Index

Category Index  July, Year 28  July, Year 29

Food  178.04  485.80

Rent  282.41  348.19

Clothing  163.21  326.79

Fuel  176.81  444.62

Miscellaneous  149.96  404.79

Overall Index  188.56  449.18

Percentage Decrease Compared to 1936 Average (1)  (1) 46.97  (1) 77.74

Note: This index is based on the living standards of workers in the pre-war year of 1936. Recently, due to rising costs, living standards have declined.

Family Bread

Regarding the production and sale of "family bread," since the last public announcement appealed for support from all sectors, the number of telephone and written inquiries received has been considerable. After providing detailed instructions, the sales of this bread have significantly increased. Currently, approximately 1,800 pounds are sold daily in the International Settlement.

Disciplinary Actions

Furthermore, the collection of information regarding other daily necessities has progressed smoothly. The department has also held multiple meetings with industry associations and representatives of retail stores to discuss the issue of reasonable profits for each industry. Since July 19th, there have been no fewer than eleven cases of stores being prosecuted for failing to comply with the bureau's regulations regarding the labeling of prices. There have been fifteen cases of hawkers being prosecuted for using substandard weighing equipment. Subsequently, the names of hawkers found guilty will be posted in the respective菜場 (vegetable markets) for public knowledge. There have been two reported cases of inflated prices, both of which have been investigated. One case, involving bread supplied to refugee organizations, was found to be inaccurate. The other case involved coal balls, which was found to be true. After a warning, the price has been adjusted.

Cooperative Fair Prices

Finally, the department still hopes that citizens from all walks of life will cooperate. Reports of hoarding and profiteering must specify particular circumstances and include substantial evidence. Otherwise, vague accusations will not be helpful. The department's office is located at 223 Hankou Road, telephone number 12410.

### Eighth Period of Fair-Price Coal Balls Begins Today: 59 Locations in Two Settlements

The eighth period of fair-price coal balls, organized by the Coal Ball Industry Association, has been decided and will begin today. Each five and a half 市斤 (catty) will be sold for three 角 (dimes) in national currency. Fifty-nine locations will be set up in the two settlements. The police departments of both settlements will dispatch detectives to provide protection. Citizens purchasing coal balls must strictly adhere to order.

### Xikou Bombed

Xikou Town in Fenghua, the hometown of Chairman Chiang, has facilities such as the Wuling School and a bus station. The architecture of buildings such as the Wenchang Pavilion is also quite impressive. Unfortunately, it was bombed by Japanese planes years ago. A portion of Xikou Town's streets were also destroyed. Unexpectedly, yesterday (9th) at approximately 9:00 AM, three Japanese planes intruded into Xikou and dropped bombs twice, totaling eight bombs. The locations where the bombs landed were: 1. Three bombs hit the Huling Hotel, causing minimal damage. 2. Five bombs landed in a vacant lot behind the bus station, causing no damage. The Wuling Hotel is built on a mountain with beautiful scenery. After the Xi'an Incident, Zhang Xueliang once lived in seclusion here before leaving after the outbreak of war. It is a place of historical significance. The Xikou bus station is close to Ningbo on one side, i.e., the Ningbo-Fenghua Road, and connected to Jinhua on the other side, i.e., the Jinhua-Xikou Joint Transportation Highway. Except for the Ningbo-Fenghua Road, which was destroyed early on, the Jinhua-Xikou Road is still open. This bombing caused no damage because the bombs landed on vacant land, so the road is still open to traffic, and transportation between Ningbo and Jinhua is not hindered.

Ningbo Association Relief Funds Arrive in Town

The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association remitted 30,000 yuan to Mr. Jiang Zaitian in Zhenhai to handle relief and comfort for disaster victims. The funds have already arrived, as reported by Mr. Jiang via telegram. At the same time, County Magistrate Zhou of Zhenhai also sent a telegram on behalf of the disaster victims to express their gratitude. However, the relief funds are still insufficient, and they hope that Shanghai will continue to raise funds for assistance. The Zhenhai refugee shelter has now been expanded to three locations, housing over 800 refugees in the largest and over 200 in the smallest. Due to the war, all the houses in the Jiangnan area have been destroyed and are now ruins. Many disaster victims from that area have come to Zhenhai in search of food, and the situation is extremely dismal.

Subsequently, French Police Commissioner Fabre and the President of the Veterans Association, Faker, delivered eulogies, praising Mr. Yangerski's spirit of bravery and dedication to public service.

### Police Department Employee Family Dispute, Both Parties Not Guilty

Lawyer Chen Wenxiang, residing at 247 Xinzha Road, has two sons and one daughter, named Yaomei, Jingmei, and Furong, all of whom are grown. Furong is married to Pan Bingyan, an employee of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department from Ningbo, and lives with him at 4 Longxin Lane, North Jiangxi Road. Recently, a rift has developed between the brothers-in-law due to a debt issue. On the 26th of last month, Furong reported to the Xinzha Police Station that she had been beaten by her two younger brothers at her mother's house, requesting her husband Pan Bingyan to do so. After an investigation by Chinese Detective Ma Derong, it was determined to be a family dispute and was not accepted. Chen Yaomei and Chen Jingmei, believing that their brother-in-law had falsely accused them, hired a lawyer to file a self-accusation of false accusation with the First Special Court Criminal Division. After the judge summoned and questioned the parties involved, he ordered that Detective Ma Derong be summoned to court for further verification. A continued hearing was held yesterday morning. According to the defendant Pan Bingyan's testimony, on the 26th of last month at 11:30 AM, I received a call in my writing room from Chen Yaomei, stating that my sister Furong had suddenly died at their home. I then asked my supervisor for leave and reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, and the detectives rushed to Chen's house, where Furong was alive and well and had not died. Later, the detectives took Chen Yaomei and others to the police station, etc. Detective Ma Derong then narrated everything, and his testimony was similar to Pan's. After reviewing the police station's report form, the judge acquitted Pan Bingyan and Pan Chen Furong.

### Tram Conductor Guilty of Manslaughter Sentenced to Two Years

At 9:40 AM on the 6th of last month, an electric bus on Route 17 stopped at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road. As passengers were boarding and alighting, the conductor Zheng Lian'gen from Ningbo, number 244, suddenly rang the bell and started the bus, causing an elderly woman, Fang Yu, 65 years old, to fall while boarding, suffering injuries that led to her death. The police arrived, took the conductor Zheng Lian'gen to the police station, and sent him to the First Court for questioning and detention. Yesterday morning, after questioning by Judge Xiao, Zheng Lian'gen was found guilty of causing death through negligence and sentenced to two years in prison as a warning.

### May's Trade Surplus Exceeds 9 Million; Domestic Exports Led by the United States

Since the sudden outbreak of the European War, China's foreign trade has improved. From January to April of this year, the trade deficit has been decreasing daily. By May, it had turned into a trade surplus. The total value of domestic exports in May reached 22,552,7314 yuan. After deducting the value of imported native goods, which was 371,129 yuan, the net value was 22,515,6185 yuan. The net value of imported foreign goods was 21,602,060 yuan. By comparing these two, the total value of exports exceeded the value of imports by 9,154,125 yuan. Taking the five months into consideration, the total value of China's foreign trade this year reached 155,559 million yuan, increased from 91,127,4369 yuan in the same period last year. The trade surplus increased by more than 64.4 million yuan. The figures of trade deficit in the first five months of this year were only slightly more than 17.57 million. From the numbers stated above, the improving foreign trade conditions are very clear. From January to May, exports to the United States were the highest, reaching 122,517,000 yuan. Hong Kong was second, reaching 17,754 million yuan. The United Kingdom was third, at 70 million yuan. In May, export figures show that the United States occupied first place, with a total value of 63,765,000 yuan. Hong Kong was second, with a total value of 44,825,000 yuan. The United Kingdom was third, with a total value of slightly more than 27,694,000 yuan.

### Shanghai Power Company Labor Dispute Again Stalled; Management Insists on Firing Employees; Yu Qiaqing Explicitly Mediates Again

The labor dispute between the British-owned Shanghai Power Company and its workers seemed to be showing some progress after numerous mediations by Yu Qiaqing. However, the company's attitude suddenly became firm yesterday, causing the situation to stagnate again. Yu Qiaqing visited the company's chairman, Mr. Kadoorie, yesterday to mediate. According to Kadoorie, the company insists on terminating the employment of twenty staff members and thirteen workers and stated that wages would be suspended for the period of the strike. He also said that over one hundred Chinese had provided bank guarantees to the company, and the salaries of the twelve Westerners employed in the factory and twenty in the office were equal to those of the Chinese, but each Westerner's work efficiency was equivalent to that of two Chinese. Yu asked the company to reconsider and then left. It is said that he will meet with Kadoorie again tomorrow.

### Abuse of Passes Will Result in Confiscation; Those Using Them for Nighttime Entertainment May Have Them Confiscated

The China Press reports that it has learned that if the curfew passes obtained by citizens for commercial purposes are abused, they will be confiscated by the authorities. Anyone who uses a pass to go to entertainment venues such as taverns and gambling dens for purposes other than legitimate business and is found leaving such venues will no longer be entitled to hold a curfew pass. It is also heard that foreign and Chinese taverns in the city are expected to comply with curfew regulations from August 9th to 14th and close earlier so that customers can return home before 12:30 AM. If any tavern receives a warning and still does not obey the order, the authorities will take action against it. Since the strict implementation of the curfew on Thursday, special patrol teams of Chinese police officers have been arresting loiterers after 12:30 AM, with approximately 300 people being detained at the Central Police Station every night.

### Owner of Zhikang Cotton Cloth Store Forges Domestic Goods Certificate; Defendant Implicates Others in Continued Hearing Yesterday Afternoon; Defendant Ordered to Provide Original Guarantee and Rescheduled for Further Hearing

Chen Yongsen, owner of Zhikang Cotton Cloth Store at 20 South Yangqiao, Baier Road, was recently sued by He Bodian, manager of Yongtaixiang Cotton Cloth Store in Qingyuan Lane, Beijing Road, who hired lawyer Mao Xianshen to file a lawsuit with the Second Special Court Criminal Division, accusing him of forging a domestic goods certificate from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and committing fraud and breach of trust. A civil lawsuit was also attached, seeking compensation for losses of 27,840 yuan. After Judge Li Weishan summoned the parties and ordered the defendant Chen Yongsen to provide bail and be summoned again, the details were previously reported in the newspaper. Since the case occurred, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has not only published a notice of investigation but also sent personnel to investigate the truth, and the situation has invisibly escalated. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the continued hearing. The defendant argued that he had entrusted Wu Xianglin of Peili Company to apply for the domestic goods certificate from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, so he did not know whether it was genuine or fake. After the plaintiff contacted him, he reported it to the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Station on July 9th and asked them to arrest Wang, but Wang had already fled to Hongkou. This matter has nothing to do with him. At this point, the plaintiff's representative, lawyer Mao, stated to the court that to apply for a domestic goods certificate from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the relevant industry association must be present to sign and issue it. Now the defendant only claims to have entrusted someone Wang to apply on his behalf, which is misleading to the court and constitutes the crime of colluding in fraud. After reviewing the statements, the court ordered the defendant to provide the original guarantee and adjourned the hearing indefinitely for further investigation.

### Five Robbers Who Kidnapped a Villager's Son Sentenced to Heavy Prison Terms

Kidnapper Xie Yongsheng from Pudong and others conspired with several others who are still at large to invade the residence of farmer Zhou Alou in Hangtou, Nanhui County, late at night on the 3rd of last month, using weapons to kidnap Zhou Alou's seven-year-old son Zhou Hongquan and brought him to Shanghai, hiding him in Room 26 of the Dongchang Inn at 398 Lane, Avenue Joffre. They sent a letter asking Zhou's family to send someone to Shanghai to negotiate a ransom of 20,000 yuan. Detective Qian Xianting of the Central Police Station learned of the plan and instructed the contact person to take 10,000 yuan in ghost money to the gate of the Guanghua Theater on Avenue Edward, according to the agreed location, to meet with the robbers and pay the ransom. The detectives took the opportunity to step forward and arrest the ringleader Xie Yongsheng and others. Based on their confessions, the hostage was rescued, and they were sent to the First Special Court for prosecution on charges of kidnapping. Judge Feng Shide concluded the trial, and Xie Yongsheng, Qin Guanxing, Wang Ying, and Sun Ada were sentenced to twelve years in prison for jointly extorting and kidnapping, and Lu Jiequan was sentenced to seven years in prison.

### Zhou Hongying Sues Fiance, Seeking Invalidation of Marriage Contract; Plaintiff Already Married to Another; Defendant Files Separate Lawsuit for Interference with Family

Zhou Hongying, a woman from Zhenjiang, 21 years old, residing at 270 Avenue Hearne, recently hired lawyer Xu Jianjie to file a lawsuit in the Second Special Court Civil Division against her fiancé Shi Wenlin (residing at 6 Yuqing Lane, West Zilaihuo Street), seeking the invalidation of the marriage contract. According to the court, the defendant replied that the plaintiff had married Ji Hanmin on July 6th of this year in 致美樓 (restaurant name) and that marrying someone else before dissolving the contract with the defendant constituted a criminal offense. Therefore, he had filed a separate lawsuit for interference with the family and requested the court to reject the plaintiff's lawsuit. After reviewing the statements, the court ordered that a verdict be given on the 14th of the month.

### Can Britain Switch to the Offensive?

Those concerned about the European war now have a question: If Hitler cannot unleash a blitzkrieg against Britain, can Britain launch an offensive against Germany?

British Prime Minister Churchill has already stated that Britain's military plan is not limited to defending against a German invasion. US Secretary of War Stimson also said that the Allies' biggest mistake was initially deciding to adopt a passive policy.

The scale of the defenses that Britain has deployed is truly astonishing. Although the British military authorities are constantly waiting for a German invasion, they have at least taken a temporary offensive. This is especially evident in the air force.

For weeks, the German air force has been continuously bombing Britain, but the British air force has also been constantly flying to Germany to attack. In terms of the results of the battle, although the British Air Force Ministry has exaggerated the losses suffered by the enemy and covered up the damage to its own country, neutral observers report that the intensity of British air raids on German territory is actually greater than that of German aircraft.

As for the reason, it is currently impossible to determine whether it is because British aircraft repeatedly penetrated deep into German territory for reconnaissance last winter, so they know German territory like the back of their hand, or because German air force pilots are not very accurate when dropping bombs at night. However, the recent implementation of daytime air raids by German aircraft seems to prove that the second reason is closer to the truth. British aircraft have also been flying to enemy countries, such as the coastal airfields of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and various locations in Germany, to intensify the offensive.

Control of the sea still rests with the British Navy. The German fleet is closed in the harbor, the Italian fleet does not dare to engage in battle, and a large portion of the French fleet has been dealt with, and the French coast has been blockaded.

But this situation is only temporary. The leading position in large-scale offensives still belongs to Germany, not Britain. The deployment of British land and sea forces is still mainly defensive. The offensive taken by the air force is just a counterattack, not a prelude to an all-out offensive.

Recognize the current situation and make a straightforward deduction: Britain is unable to launch an offensive until two preparations have been completed. The so-called two preparations: First, it must gain air superiority; second, it must quickly catch up and enrich its motorized army groups, so that their strength is sufficient to launch a large-scale offensive into enemy territory.

First, in terms of air superiority, when the German army launched a blitzkrieg against Belgium and France, the Allied forces were defeated beyond redemption due to the disparity in the number of aircraft. British factories have recently been able to step up manufacturing, and they have indeed recovered a lot from this tragic disadvantage in the number of aircraft. As for fighter pilots and air force warriors, Britain still maintains a qualitative advantage.

Next, in terms of mechanized equipment, manufacturing has also been accelerated since last month, but the results are not yet known. What is certain is that Britain was completely unprepared for this when the war began last September, and only began to step up manufacturing in mid-May of this year. In the Battle of Flanders, it lost almost everything again. Up to now, it can be said that it still does not have sufficient mechanized equipment to undertake an offensive.

Therefore, the answer to the question of whether Britain can switch to the offensive depends half on Britain's own efforts and half on the assistance of the United States and the various parts of the British Empire. If Britain's production volume can be unimpeded by continuous bombing by German aircraft, then given time, Britain will be able to create a large number of aircraft, tanks, artillery, and other equipment for use in launching an offensive. But this situation is impossible. Therefore, whether Britain can gain air superiority and mechanized forces is determined by the assistance of the United States and the various parts of the British Empire.

Most military experts agree that Britain must break Germany's air power before it can send troops to land in front of the enemy. The current air raids and occasional naval battles cannot save the war.

However, according to reliable sources, although Britain is currently taking a defensive position, it has no intention of staying that way forever. The British military authorities are actively planning a general offensive against Germany. Secretary of War Eden strongly advocates taking an offensive, and the British staff and generals are also enthusiastically supporting his proposal. The only thing that is unknown is the timing.

### Stalin's Successor, Zhdanov

— r.L.

In recent years, at Soviet Communist Party public gatherings, we have often seen a short, stout man in his forties sitting beside the dictator Stalin. With a uniformly round "Russian" face, he sported a short beard. Stalin was very affectionate towards him, sometimes patting him on the shoulder, sometimes whispering a few words in his ear. Most Communist leaders have "laborious faces," but this round-faced man was a unique presence. In photos taken at public events, he always displayed the clever smile of someone with a carefree and comfortable life. This person is Andrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov.

In the mysterious and unpredictable Kremlin, every move of the Communist dictator, whether speaking or laughing, carries significant meaning. However, if someone were to ask what important position Zhdanov actually held, veteran foreign observers in Moscow, besides casually saying, "Ah, he's Stalin's adjutant," would not know his true background. Until recently, they made a surprising discovery. It turns out that Zhdanov has been "Stalin's successor" for at least four or five years. He was personally appointed by the dictator and evidently recognized by the Communist Party cadres. Even while Stalin is still alive, this "Number Two Red"—equivalent to Germany's "Number Two Leader," Göring—already wields considerable power on the Soviet political stage. Whether the Soviet Union will participate in the European war seems to depend on him. Therefore, it is no wonder that the diplomatic envoys of various European countries pay close attention to every word and action of Zhdanov.

Zhdanov's status as Stalin's "heir" has not been publicly announced. Like Stalin, he is not a fundamental official of the Soviet government. Only through interpersonal relationships and the relative closeness of those around Stalin, after a considerable amount of time and various special signs, was Zhdanov's true position and the importance of his future discovered. Stalin has also recently, intentionally or unintentionally, given hints about his succession, sometimes deliberately revealing some clues. At the graduation ceremony of a military academy, when raising a toast, everyone only shouted, "Long live Stalin and Zhdanov!" Zhdanov was recently also referred to as the "Supreme Naval Commissar," just as Stalin is the "Supreme Commissar" of the Red Army.

Besides these superficial characteristics, although Zhdanov is not a key member of the highest political organs in the Soviet Union, the real power he wields is extraordinary. In addition to the "People's Committee" and other top institutions, there is an inconspicuous ruling cadre within the Communist Party, in which Zhdanov's position is second only to Stalin. For example, he is currently the leader of the Leningrad Party Committee, wielding great power and honor. According to Communist Party practice, only the dictator's successor can enjoy such a position. Zhdanov assumed this position in 1934 after the assassination of the former leader of the Leningrad Party Committee, Kirov. Looking back, it is clear that Stalin regarded Kirov not only as a close friend but also as his natural successor.

The Soviet-Finnish War was directed by Zhdanov. In the summer of 1939, while Europe was still in an atmosphere of peace, Zhdanov openly stated, "Soviet Russia must obtain military bases in the Gulf of Finland and the Arctic Sea to ensure the security of Leningrad and the Murmansk railway." The demands on Finland were also drafted by him, and the failure of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations in November was orchestrated by him and Stalin. After the war began, he "single-handedly shouldered the burden," frequently traveling to the front lines to coordinate military operations.

Zhdanov is 44 years old this year, a well-built, medium-sized man, full of energy and vitality. He often works 14 to 15 hours a day. He was born in the Pskov province of northern Russia. His father was a poor church clerk. His early life is not well known. After the outbreak of the last European war, he dropped out of school to join the army and received the Imperial Russian Cross of St. George. After the 1917 revolution, he stood on the side of the Communist Party and participated in the civil war. His history of joining the party is not long; he began working within the party only after the civil war ended. It took him twelve years to rise from an "unknown soldier" to enter the inner sanctum of Communist Party power.

From 1914 to 1931, he engaged in genuine revolutionary work in the wilderness and fields, unlike other revolutionary leaders who remotely commanded from military headquarters or government residences in grand buildings. He witnessed the peasant revolution, the struggles of workers, and personally experienced the pain of hunger. All of this shaped his strong and resolute personality today. He is not particularly devoted to Leninism. Deep down, he is an opportunist who prioritizes expediency. He is a skilled speaker, shedding the "stale and verbose" clichés of the "old Communist Party." He uses sharp words, including lively and easily understood meanings. On the one hand, his round, smiling face shows great optimism; on the other hand, his sharp teeth and large fists represent a kind of barbaric aura of the Soviet ruling class. He gives young university students a good impression and inspires trust in them. The inhumane and terrible measures of the first year of the Soviet revolution were gradually improved thanks to his efforts.

Zhdanov's two important positions, Deputy Secretary-General of the Communist Party Central Committee (the Secretary-General being Stalin) and Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee, allow him to play a significant role in shaping Soviet foreign policy. The Soviet Foreign Minister, Molotov, is his close friend, and their cooperation is like adding wings to a tiger. Like many "new" party members, he is a fervent patriot and nationalist, reversing the style of the older generation like Trotsky, Zinoviev, and Bukharin, who regarded internationalism as their destination or only valued Communist theory. He has never lived abroad and has no interest in foreign laboring classes. His diplomatic creed is: "The foreign policy of our government aims at the welfare of the Soviet people." He does not ask about anything else. His motivation for the war against Finland was based on this. The resignation of Foreign Minister Litvinov, an internationalist, a year ago was also due to his exclusion. The bombshell German-Soviet pact of August 23, 1939, was also facilitated by Zhdanov.

The German-Soviet pact was initiated on June 19, 1939, when Zhdanov published an article saying that the British and French negotiations with the Soviet Union "lacked sincerity" and were nothing more than provoking Germany and the Soviet Union to fight each other. The Soviet Union should stop negotiations and reconcile with Germany. After August 23, London and Paris realized that Stalin was actually speaking through Zhdanov's mouth. Subsequently, they began to pay attention to this "successor."

Zhdanov has no particular inclination towards Britain, France, or Germany; he only favors Soviet Russia. He once said, "Britain and France hope that Soviet Russia will fight but offer no benefits to it; Germany does not ask it to fight but gives it a large piece of former Russian land. The decision between these two is certainly not difficult." From then on, the world knew that Zhdanov was a keen and frank nationalist.

What were Stalin's motives for choosing Zhdanov as his "successor"?

The "Red Party Dictator" is now 61 years old. His health is said to be strong, but he has endured more hardships and dangers than ordinary people can know. Perhaps he will not live much longer. At the same time, his close associates, Molotov, Voroshilov, and Beria, are also eagerly awaiting the selection of Stalin's successor and hoping for an early arrangement.

If Stalin were to die without an "heir," and everyone were to compete for the vacant "throne," these people would not only be in great danger but might even lose their lives. Indeed, the fact that Lenin died without a successor seventeen years ago was a big mistake. After a long period of strife, Stalin seized his "throne." Other people, such as Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Bukharin, almost all became Stalin's enemies and were executed by firing squad. Moreover, the current conspicuous phenomenon is that if Stalin withdraws to the west without a successor, then various conspiracies of suspicion and seizure will arise immediately, even messing up his own position.

Stalin has a grown son, who works as an engineer, from his divorced ex-wife. The relationship between father and son is very bad. This son lives far from Moscow and never meets his father. Stalin's second wife, Alliluyeva, passed away several years ago and had a son and a daughter, but both are minors. The person who inherits Stalin's position must be a mature, robust, and powerful man.

Zhdanov is undoubtedly an excellent candidate. It is said that Stalin was very pleased when he saw this young man at the age of thirty. Over the years, Zhdanov has always shown loyalty and firmness during Stalin's party purges, and he has made great efforts to eliminate reactionary elements within the Leningrad region. But strangely enough, he does not have many enemies. He is unlike other Communist leaders who have killed many people. His way of dealing with people is very fair and peaceful, and he can coordinate between different factions. Although he is married, he is very strict with himself, and no one speaks ill of him. Because of his simple Russian style and uncompromising nationalism, he is widely loved in the army and navy.

However, Zhdanov's status has not been formally announced to the public by Stalin. Indeed, before the public learns about his background, if Zhdanov were to plot against his dictator, Stalin could "remove" him quietly.

What will Zhdanov's fate be? Serving as Stalin's successor is full of thorns and dangers. The dictator Stalin is naturally suspicious. It is truly said, "Attending the monarch is like attending a tiger." Being with him, the outcome is still difficult to predict.

### Rumors of Drought Demons

Drought demons (旱魃) as scourges are found in the Book of Songs. This is, of course, an inauspicious creature, unseen by most of the world. Recently, I heard that people in Guangfu Mountain are spreading rumors that in the past month, whenever the stars and moon shine brightly, there is often a creature appearing on the mountaintop, squatting on the treetops. Its shape is like a human but not human, like a ghost but not a ghost. Its face and features are indistinguishable. It is only felt that its whole body is as white as lead. On its head, it wears a crown like an upturned bowl, and there is often white vapor rising upwards. The mountain people say in unison that since this creature appeared, there has been no rain for two months, so there is a widespread rumor of drought demons.

Excuse Me

In Tianjin, those who push small carts are called "cart handles" by the locals. When they ask people to make way, they say "Excuse me" (借光). However, they charge straight ahead, and pedestrians are often unable to dodge in time and are injured by them. On the fifteenth of last month, a small cart on the Dongfu Bridge rammed into a person, causing them to bleed. The victim argued with the "cart handle," who said, "I already said 'Excuse me.' You were careless yourself, so what are you complaining about?" and swaggered away. The injured person was furious. Just then, he saw a wooden pole by the roadside. He quickly grabbed it and chased after the cart pusher, randomly striking him on the buttocks. With each strike, he shouted "Excuse me." By the time the cart pusher released the cart and turned back, his buttocks were covered in swollen lumps. Onlookers all shouted with great delight.

### Christ's Voluntary Sacrifice (1)

Whenever we mention Jesus, we think of his death by crucifixion. As for the morality of his life, he was truly an unprecedented and unparalleled perfect man of all time. When we think of his tragic death, everyone sheds tears of sorrow. But Jesus himself said, "No one takes my life from me, but I lay it down of my own accord." Thus, his painful death was a voluntary sacrifice. What lessons does his voluntary sacrifice teach us?

(1) It teaches us what love is: We are not here to define love, nor to establish an object for love, nor to say how many limitations there are on the scope of love, but to talk about how much a person can do because of love? The extreme of love, like Jesus' love, is to willingly give up our lives for us. (John 15:13) The poet felt the insignificance of man and once asked, "What is man?" Man is truly insignificant! Especially those who commit crimes and do evil are even more insignificant! Man can be as high as angels, called saints, called gods, but can also fall to a position inferior to all things. The Son of God—Jesus, willingly sacrificed on the cross for people who are "insignificant," does this not let us know God's love?

(2) It teaches us what true friendship is: Jesus once said to his disciples, "This is my command: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends…" (John 15:12) An ancient saying goes, "To have one close friend, even death is without regret." It can be seen that all human beings have the emotions of seeking friends. At the same time, we often know that it is very difficult for people to get a close friend. As for the friendship of risking one's life for a friend, there are even fewer. In this world, everyone needs friends. If he cannot find people to be friends with, he must regard birds, beasts, flowers, trees, as well as flowers and trees, as confidants, so that his emotions can be entrusted to them. Lin Hejing, the "plum wife and crane child," is a good example. However, everything in the world that can be regarded as a friend—animals, flowers, trees, music, books, etc.—ultimately cannot leave people permanently, and there are few friends who are truly willing to sacrifice for friends. Only Jesus loves the world and takes the world as a friend, and lays down his life for his friends.

### Please Everyone Create Happiness for Children

— Wang Cangping

Loving games is the nature of children and also a right they should enjoy, but on this island, their rights are being deprived. Living in cage-like houses, not to mention playing games, even joyful activities are being restricted. In most schools, even the courtyards have been made into classrooms, and lofts have also been built. After-school activities are like a carousel in a mess. Fresh sunlight and air are far from them. Sundays are originally good days for them. Going to the park can also stretch their stiff limbs, but many parents, because both tram and bus fares have risen and they have to buy tickets, are already overwhelmed by the expenses of firewood, rice, oil, and salt alone. For such games, they know it is beneficial, but they can only save on it. As a result, many children do not receive the benefits of nature throughout the year. In order to make up for this shortcoming, I will list my ideal children's welfare undertakings below:

Those who have private gardens, and larger schools that have larger sports fields, can stipulate that they will be lent to students of various primary schools without sports fields for a few days each week as a place for sports. (However, most owners who have a desire to occupy land are unwilling to accept this request and should find ways to unblock it universally) Establish children's libraries. People from all walks of life should raise funds based on their abilities, regardless of the size of the scale. In short, the more libraries, the better, but the selection of books must be done by experts. It is best to add a children's playroom in one corner of the reading room, so that after reading, they can play games, and both their mind and body can be pleasantly satisfied. Furthermore, each library should hold children's works exhibitions several times each year to promote children's interest in learning.

Advocate for children's movies. I think it is just as profitable as the normal stuff, as long as the boss of the film company invites a few directors and writers who know children's psychology well to engage in the production of children's films. There must be many materials to choose from, and business will definitely not be small, because there are no parents in the world who do not love their children, and parents will definitely not be deliberately stingy with their children's requests.

Major companies should strive to manufacture educational toys, which must have the conditions of enlightening knowledge and being fascinating, and profit should not be too high, so sales will definitely be smooth, and the effect of small profits and quick turnover will still be achieved. Radio stations should tell more children's stories. In terms of selection of materials, such as Qi Jiguang, Yue Fei, Sima Guang, etc., based on history, it is okay to be creative and use in-depth and clear techniques, plus many interesting insertions. Such stories are also very popular with women.

You can also use the radio station to hold children's speech competitions to stimulate children's thinking, and organize children's food production and sales cooperatives, because children's food is mostly purchased from street vendors, which is very harmful to hygiene. The products of the cooperative should be clean, nutritious, and cheap. Employ poor, refugee children, wearing uniforms, carrying food boxes, selling them along the streets, supplying fresh food needed by children throughout the city. The organizational law can be formulated by experts. Although the above points are my ideals, in a healthy society, they are indeed necessary. Shanghai is not short of enthusiastic people. I hope they will rise up and advocate for opening up happy gardens for these boring and dull children to cultivate their spirits and improve their lives. This is truly the happiness of society and the happiness of the country.

### A Smart Old Man

— Chi Er

Once upon a time, there was an old man walking on a narrow and long path. There were rivers on both sides of the path, and it was covered with weeds. He held a dry tobacco pipe, a dry tobacco pouch, and a box of matches in his hand, walking and smoking with great satisfaction. Unexpectedly, he threw a burning matchstick on the ground. The grass was dry, and it caught fire and burned quickly, spreading very quickly. When he saw it, he hurried forward, but the fire behind him, aided by the tailwind, followed him. He was so anxious at the time that he was at a loss. There were rivers on both sides, and he could not jump down. The fire behind him was coming so fast that he was so scared that he ran forward desperately. After running for a short time, he suddenly remembered that everything must be done calmly, otherwise it would be like a moth flying into the fire, courting its own destruction. So, he tried his best to calm his mind, suppressed his panicked attitude, and worked hard to use his brain. As a result, he really thought of a perfect solution. He hurriedly lit a match, threw it on the dry grass in front, and the grass in front caught fire and burned. He ran along with the fire in front. In this way, the fire behind him could not burn him.

Children, after reading such a story, you will definitely say in unison: "This old man is extremely smart!" and admire his resourcefulness. But what if a person encounters something difficult and does not panic at all? If you can calmly think of a way to deal with the environment, then there is no reason not to succeed. Look at the story in front, if the old man had not thought of a good way, how could he not have been burned to death? Therefore, it is useless to just be anxious without thinking of a solution.

Children! I urge you all not to panic when encountering things, you should be calm, because just panicking is the road to self-destruction.

### Hurricane

— Su Ming

In the past few days, the newspaper has published news about hurricanes, "A hurricane has started in the Pacific Ocean. The wind is quite strong and is heading rapidly in the northwest-west direction. Whether Shanghai will be hit is being closely monitored by the observatory, and ships are warned…" Yonger saw this news and only half understood it. "Why is the hurricane like a specialty of the Pacific Ocean?" He asked his brother Zonger.

"Before answering your question, do you know how the wind happens? A hurricane is a type of wind, so the question you asked can also be solved." After Zonger finished speaking, Yonger shook his head to show that he did not know.

"The flow of air becomes wind, but how does air flow? This is entirely caused by the different air pressure. Because a portion of the air is affected by the increase in temperature and becomes very light, and the air nearby is not heated, so it is heavier. So it sinks down and pushes the light air up, thus causing air circulation, resulting in air flow, and there is wind. Shaking the fan will cause wind, that is man-made wind, and the reason is the same. The cause of natural wind is the change in air pressure, so why can air pressure change? When you burn a piece of wood, you can see the sparks go straight up. This phenomenon is because the heated air expands and becomes light, so there is a tendency to rise, and then the cold and heavy air from the surroundings comes to fill it, which becomes wind. For example, standing by the sea during the day, you only feel that the wind is blowing from the sea, because the air on land is easier to heat than the air on the water, so the air on the ground rises during the day, and the air blowing from the sea comes to fill it. Another type is caused by air vortices. This is because the sun heats the ground, so locally changes in air pressure occur, and the air flowing from the surroundings forms vortices. This is really like quickly rotating your hand in a water basin, and the water becomes a vortex. The center is very concave, so the closer to the center, the smaller the pressure. The situation of that vortex is exactly the same, but the air becomes water. Although the location of this vortex changes, it is still spinning. The size of the wind is determined by the comparison of the air pressure around and in the center of the vortex. If the air pressure in the center of the vortex is lower than the surrounding area, it is called low pressure. If it is higher than the surrounding area, it is called high pressure. Low pressure and high pressure are not fixed in one place, but gradually move forward, similar to the speed of a train, but high pressure is slower. When low pressure comes, it will rain. When high pressure arrives, a downward airflow will occur, and the air will descend near the ground, the water vapor will rise and disappear, the sky will clear, and the climate will feel cold. If the low pressure is too great, a storm will occur, and a hurricane is the greatest degree of low pressure. This type of low pressure is most likely to occur in the Pacific Ocean and the South Seas Islands, and its occurrence period is also fixed, always in July, August and September. The journey of a hurricane is mostly in the form of an oval, so the eastern provinces of our country and Japan are often hit by hurricanes, and the losses are of course very large."

### Small Games

— Ci Kai

There is a balance, and both pans can hold weights. Now, we need to use five weights to weigh anything from one to one hundred and twenty pounds. What are the weights of these five weights?

There are three white chess pieces and three black chess pieces, arranged in a row of white white black black. Each time I move two adjacent pieces, without inserting them into places where there is no space. By moving three times, I can change it to a row of black white alternating. What method do you think there is?

I can draw a big circle in one stroke and write 103 characters in the air.

### Shirley Temple's Autobiography (14)

They were all my loved ones, all whom I loved—but Dad was an exception, for he was the first and most loved of all. He is very happy now; but he also had unhappy times before. I remember when I first worked in short films, I heard Mom say to someone that I only earned forty or fifty yuan for each short film. My income was meager, and then some news came from the bank where Dad worked. He didn't explain to me what it was, but I heard him talking to Mom. Looking at his face, I knew the news was very bad. Finally, one day, he stayed home and didn't go to the bank. He never stayed home except on Sundays, so this was a strange thing to see for the first time. I asked him why he didn't go out? He said that President Roosevelt had ordered all banks to close, so he couldn't go to work anymore.

At that time, we were sitting in the garden of the old house in Santa Monica. I can't remember which day it was, only that it definitely wasn't Sunday. It was usually quiet in the garden except on Sundays, but I didn't know why. Dad and I were sitting on a bench outside my little playhouse. His face showed unhappiness, and he didn't know what to do. I was very uneasy and determined to cheer him up. I was about to climb onto Dad's lap and say, "Dad, I love you very much," but just then Mom came out of the house, hurrying us to go to the studio because it was getting late. So we got into Dad's car, and he drove us to the studio. I sat between my parents, and we didn't say much on the way. When we arrived at the studio gate, Mom and I got out of the car, and Dad forced a slight smile and said, "Even though he has nothing to do, at least one person in the Temple family is working!" Oh, he didn't know that good luck would befall us on Christmas of that year. If he had known in advance, he would have been very happy.

You see, a few months later, I was assigned to star in a great film! After it was released, I became a big Hollywood star like Janet Gaynor and Greta Garbo!

I'm telling you the story of how this happened, as many people have asked me before. They said, "Two years ago, no one had ever heard of Shirley Temple. Where did you suddenly come from?" Actually, my emergence wasn't sudden. I had been working hard in short films for some time, and fame doesn't come easily.

After Dad lost his job when the bank closed, Mom soon received news that we would no longer be making those "Baby Burlesks" short films. The director told her that we had made seven, but the audience didn't like them, they weren't as popular as the "Our Gang" comedies, so the results were mediocre. Besides, the children were growing up and no longer looked like babies.

Entertainment World

### Norma Shearer, Comet of the Film World - Today Is Her Thirty-Sixth Birthday

— Qinghui

Among movie stars, no one currently holds a higher position or enjoys a greater reputation than Norma Shearer. She has won the Academy Award for three consecutive years (1936 for "The Barretts of Wimpole Street," 1937 for "Romeo and Juliet," and 1938 for "Marie Antoinette"). She is truly a comet in the silver world! She was born on August 11, 1904, and today is exactly her thirty-sixth birthday. At the age of fifteen, she went to New York with her mother and two sisters. They wandered there for half a year without any success. Penniless, they learned that a film company was hiring twelve extras. They rushed to apply and were happily all hired. They could earn five dollars a day working. At that time, arc lights had not yet been invented, and filming relied on sunlight, so they became unemployed on cloudy days.

Two Failures

Soon after, she gained the favor of Irving Thalberg, the manager of Universal Studios, who agreed to sign her to a long-term contract. Later, Irving suddenly received a telegram from his father, saying that the lead actress in a film was ill. So Norma hurriedly traveled to New York again, only to find that the lead actress had recovered by the time she arrived, and Norma was unemployed again. At that time, she had briefly worked as an artist's model, but this was not a proper profession. Later, she got an opportunity and immediately devoted herself to the stage, gradually gaining popularity. Soon, she won the championship in a beauty contest, and with this title, she officially stepped onto the silver screen in 1920, signing a five-year contract with MGM for one hundred dollars a week. Thus, she went from small roles to supporting roles to lead roles, and eventually she was praised as the "First Lady of the Screen."

Wedding Ceremony

On Norma's third anniversary in Hollywood, Irving invited her to his home for dinner. This was the first sign of their affection. From then on, their feelings grew stronger day by day, and on September 29, 1928, they happily held their wedding. On September 14, 1936, Irving passed away from pneumonia, and her family happiness was declared bankrupt. In 1938, she made a comeback.

New Romance

Later, she started a new romance. Her neighbor, Franchot Tone Jr., was very close to her for a while. After Franchot Tone Jr. went to London, she had to pursue James Stewart. Now Stewart is pursuing Olivia de Havilland, and Franchot Tone Jr. has also gotten married. Disappointed, Norma became intensely involved with George Raft. Norma's recent situation is very leisurely and contented. Besides being with George Raft, she spends most of her time with her children. She has a ten-year-old son named Irving Thalberg Jr. and a five-year-old daughter named Kathleen. She is full of maternal love, teaching them Latin in her spare time and using various methods to make them happy.

### An Analysis of Today's Shanghai Film Industry - The So-Called "Two Major Camps" and Others

— Haixing

When discussing today's Chinese film industry, it is said that it can be divided into two major camps. One is led by Zhang Shankun, including the three studios of Xinhua, Huaxin, and Huacheng, as well as distribution directors Wu Bangfan, Bian Yuying, and Li Dashen, Shen Quan'yin of Lianmei, Yan Hewu of Meicheng, and Yihua, which can also be included in this camp. Today, most directors and actors are recruited by Zhang's Guolian, so Lianmei and others must cooperate with Zhang in their production or distribution for the sake of convenience. As for the Nanyue Company, which is about to move to Shanghai, it will also be difficult to escape this pattern. If not, at least there will be major problems with manpower. The other camp, on the surface, seems to be Guohua and Jinxing, but in reality, the relationship between these two companies is only that they produce in the same location and some staff and actors can be used in common. The most important aspect of the quality of their products—their production policy—can be said to be completely different. From the Jinxing authorities' repeated discussions, it is known that they will open up new paths, and there will be no possible conflicts with Guolian and others in the future—such as the double-package case. Jinxing and Minhua are quite similar, as they both have their own ambitions. Minhua's attitude can be explained by director Fei Mu's way of dealing with the world: not saying much, working hard, and leaving the judgment of right and wrong to the world. As for Hezong, which specializes in filming "The Embroidered Scholar," it has a different attitude. It is relatively financially well-off, as if it doesn't care. Judging from the fact that the owner of Hezong, Wu Xingzai, has been supporting Ying Yin for a long time without rushing to talk about work, the reporter's words may not be too exaggerated.

In short, the so-called two major camps are actually just the Guolian system and Guohua. In terms of manpower and resources, Guohua is difficult to compete with the former, but the Liu brothers of Guohua are also capable people and have a strong desire to compete. As for Minhua, Hezong, and Jinxing, they do not have the same ambition and cannot be included in any camp.

There is progress after competition, but the way of competition must advance in both quality and quantity, otherwise it will inevitably go astray, which is not a blessing for the film industry.

Hawthorn Detective Agency

### The Dancer's Destiny

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Five - Bad News

Hawthorn's answers on the phone were enough to make me nervous, but at this time there was another kind of unexpected tension that gave this case a dramatic development. When Hawthorn was on the phone, his eyes were always glancing out through the glass of the phone booth. I was standing at the entrance of the phone booth, facing Hawthorn, with my back to the entrance and exit of the hotel. I suddenly saw Hawthorn's eyes flash, followed by him raising his left hand like lightning, pointing behind me. Seeing his tense state, I didn't have time to ask questions, and quickly turned my head and saw the back of a man in a suit, hurrying towards the elevator. In this split second, I started running blindly after him. The man was five or six steps away from me. As he reached the elevator door, the two milky white painted steel doors were about to close. He tilted his body to the side, inserted himself in, and the steel doors closed. When I ran to the door, the elevator had already slowly started to rise! I hurriedly knocked on the steel door with my fist, looked up, and the indicator needle had just left "1" and suddenly stopped and went back, and the steel door reopened for me to enter.

When I stepped into the elevator, I secretly breathed a sigh of relief, my heart still pounding. But I had to pretend to be calm on the outside. I thought to myself that Hawthorn's tense signal must have been of great importance. He must have seen someone but didn't have time to follow, so he suddenly urged me to do it for him. So, who did he see? Could it be Zhao Boxiong? (72)
