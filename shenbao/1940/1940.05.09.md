### The Besieged Japanese Troops in Southern Henan Attempt to Break Through in Small Groups Without Success; Remnants of Japanese Troops Near Tanghe Are Defeated in a Pincer Attack; Japanese Troops Surrounded by Chinese Forces in the Suizao Mountain Area of Northern Hubei

Nanyang (Eighth Dispatch) News received here in Chongqing today indicates that Japanese troops, who had advanced northwest along the Nanyang-Tongbai-Xinyang highway and the Nanyang-Biyang-Queshan highway, had their main force surrounded and attacked by the Chinese army in the area east of Biyang and Tongbai. Unable to move, they are gradually being eliminated. As of yesterday afternoon, the Japanese situation was increasingly unsustainable, and they split into small groups to break out to the northwest. One group of more than two thousand had advanced to the vicinity of Tanghe, but after a pincer attack by the Chinese army, these Japanese troops were completely dispersed by dusk. The remnants fled west towards the northwest and north of Tanghe that evening.

Fancheng (Eighth Dispatch) The Japanese, lingering near Suixian, advanced towards Tangxianzhen (northwest of Suixian) yesterday, where they were met with resistance from a Chinese unit, which inflicted heavy casualties.

More than five hundred were killed or wounded. The following force of four to five thousand men, after passing Changshoudian, northwest of Zhongxiang, had their retreat cut off by Chinese forces. Another group of more than three thousand Japanese troops, attacking Tianjiaji, southwest of Zao yang, is still being annihilated by Chinese forces. On the main front of the Xianghua Road, Chinese and Japanese forces are still fighting near Tangxianzhen, east of Zao yang. Although the Japanese attacked with more than fifty tanks, they failed to break through the Chinese lines. On the southern Henan front, the Japanese used a division-sized force to attack fiercely westward from Xichuan, but after suffering a heavy blow from a Chinese flanking attack, further westward expansion has become impossible.

Editorial

### A Perspective on Japanese Diplomacy

Examining the diplomacy of various countries in recent years, the most seemingly active yet actually confused, the most seemingly adept at expediency yet actually the most aimless, the most seemingly opportunistic yet actually ending up with nothing, the most seemingly capable of exploiting others and seizing opportunities yet actually ending up deceiving and harming itself – the two countries that stand out above all others are: Poland and Japan.

Poland relied heavily on the German-Italian axis while also engaging with the British-French group. In the near term, it took advantage of Czechoslovakia and Lithuania, seizing opportunities during times of trouble. From afar, it brazenly recognized the so-called "Manchukuo" to curry favor with Japan. While calling for anti-aggression, it also aspired to join the ranks of powerful countries capable of aggression. Now, not only has it acted contrary to its own principles, but its territory has been returned, and its entire nation has fallen under the control of the Soviet and German powers. We pity it but will leave it aside for now.

As for Japan, for the past two or three years, besides its invasion of China, its diplomacy has been seen to be revolving around courting or antagonizing Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Germany. Furthermore, it has been demonstrating aggression towards French Indochina, exerting pressure on Portuguese Macau, and coveting the Dutch East Indies. Its various actions have seemed to scatter attention everywhere, darting left and right, almost to the point of causing dizziness. This kind of diplomatic tactic is probably something that Japanese diplomatic officials since Mutsu Munemitsu and Komura Jutarō could not have even dreamed of. But what has been achieved?

Japan has not only achieved nothing at present but will inevitably suffer the consequences. However, there is something that cannot be ignored, because Japan, in its diplomatic tactics, also has a fundamental basis that remains constant amidst all the changes, and it is vigorously pursuing it in different ways with a persevering spirit. Consider the speech given by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita Hachirō to the Japan International Association on the 4th of this month, in which he strongly criticized the reckless high-sounding rhetoric among the Japanese people of punishing Britain and the United States and waging war against the Soviet Union, and advocated for improving relations with the United States and the Soviet Union. Arita has always been the diplomat who most represents the radical opinions of the Japanese military, having personally concluded the Anti-Comintern Pact and being the mastermind behind last year's anti-British movement. Now, he is appearing to admonish the nation with a mature and cautious attitude, which cannot help but cause a sense of surprise. However, this is not Arita being abnormal, but rather a tactic of Japan. Arita also said: "Although the feelings of Americans towards Japan are particularly bad, we must not provoke them." However, the most recent action by the Japanese side to provoke the United States was Arita's personally issued statement about preparing to interfere in the Dutch East Indies. With a difference of only twenty days between these two events, the change in attitude is so stark that it aptly illustrates the fickleness of Japanese diplomacy.

From a principled point of view, diplomacy cannot exert an independent function. In peacetime, it is subordinate to politics, and in wartime, it is subservient to military affairs. Moreover, diplomacy can only supplement what politics and military affairs cannot achieve; it can never fundamentally change the basic state of affairs in military and political aspects. It seems that the Japanese authorities have a misconception: they always regard diplomacy as the "Philosopher's Stone" in alchemy, hoping to achieve through diplomacy what they cannot achieve in the political and military spheres. All the difficulties and predicaments brought about by their basic national policy are entrusted to the Kasumigaseki authorities [Japanese Foreign Ministry] to resolve. This is a difficult problem that the diplomatic authorities of any country have never encountered, and its failure is clearly not just the fault of the general incompetence of Japanese diplomats. This situation has led to the distorted posture of Japan's foreign policy today, revealing Japan's inner anxieties. That kind of foolishly arrogant rhetoric and grandiose pronouncements are indeed caused by the narrow-minded and impulsive national character of the islanders, but they are also a kind of function of Japanese diplomacy. For example, the progress of the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo last summer was the result of this kind of soft and hard tactics. Western countries have been in contact with Japan since the time of Commodore Perry nearly a century ago, but they often lack a deep understanding. Taking recent facts into account, except for the Soviet Union's profound and opportunistic diplomatic strategy that sometimes makes Japan look ridiculous, other countries are often deceived by Japan's deliberately contrived diplomatic posture. Although the Japanese authorities have not been able to fulfill their grand ambition of using diplomacy to alleviate the deficiencies of military and political affairs, their idea that Western countries can be deceived by their methods still continues to this day.

The significance of Arita's speech this time lies in its admonishment to the Japanese people, but what he hopes for is that Western countries will accept this Eastern version of ingratiating charm. Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma Yakichiro stated on the 1st of this month that he is willing to conclude non-aggression treaties with various small countries or colonies in Asia to guarantee the status quo in the Far East. His intention is the same as that of Arita's speech. Arita's statement on April 15 regarding the Dutch East Indies has already caused a negative reaction from the United States. The new immigration bill in the Philippines has also restricted Japanese migration to the Philippines. There is news that the US fleet will remain in the Far East for a long time after major exercises in the Pacific. In addition, there is a possibility that the US Congress will reconsider the anti-Japanese embargo bills proposed by Pittman and others before the June recess. All of these pressures are forcing the Japanese side to adopt a moderate attitude towards the United States to gain goodwill. It is said that when U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre visited Japan recently, Arita tried his best to be humble and friendly, which is exactly in line with the aforementioned expressions of Arita and Suma.

However, all of this is merely a superficial posture. It cannot represent Japan's true foreign policy direction, nor can it affect its basic expansionist policy. Perhaps the Japanese zaibatsu are preparing to secretly extend their terrible claws of aggression under this sugar-coated exterior. Since Arita's statement was met with setbacks internationally, the Japanese side has not promoted this issue much, but one should not mistakenly believe that the Japanese zaibatsu will truly retreat in the face of difficulties. Japan's southward advance plan has been premeditated and carefully arranged for many years. Especially now that the war of aggression against China has dragged on without success, they will not relax their grip on this treasure trove that is within easy reach. According to yesterday's news, the relationship between the Netherlands and Germany has become extremely strained, and it is conceivable that Japan's soaring ambitions are about to try again.

The United States' firm stance in the Far East is undoubtedly undeniable, but its measures are often deemed to be overly cautious or slow. Japan is exploiting this situation by putting on a charming display on the outside, in order to ease the United States' intense public sentiment. It is better to take decisive action than to try to fix things after they have gone wrong. This is the lesson that recent events in Europe have taught us. We hope that the United States will not repeat the mistakes of Britain in Europe in the Far East.

### Moscow Newspaper Denounces Finland for Violating the Peace Treaty: Destruction of All Industries in the Ceded Area, Believing This Action Will Surely Instigate Someone

Moscow: Today, the "Pravda" published an article stating that construction work is actively underway in the area of Finland handed over to the Soviet Union. At the same time, it denounced Finland for violating its promises. The article stated, "In various towns and cities, houses and streets have been repaired, and countless people have gained employment. However, the Finnish authorities destroyed various factories before the handover. For example, the weaving factory in Yaskholm. If a person were to witness the state of destruction, they would believe that a barbarian tribe was active there. The majority of the machines were destroyed by the Finnish side with axes, and the degree of destruction was extremely deep, enough to suggest that the Finnish side intended to make it completely impossible for the factory to resume work. A detailed examination of the extent of the damage proves that this destruction work was carried out after the signing of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty and before the Finnish troops withdrew. The Finnish conspiracy is extremely obvious. They intend to claim that this destruction was the result of air raids and shelling. However, since no fighting ever occurred near Kexholm, their sophistry is self-defeating. The above destruction is only part of it. In addition, power plants, boiler plants, etc., were also completely destroyed. 410 motors and water pumps were also taken away. In short, all the machines have either been destroyed or taken away. Moreover, the upper level of the factory was not damaged, while the lower level was severely damaged. This proves that the lower level was destroyed by explosives. After the Soviet troops occupied the area, they discovered explosives in various factories. Fortunately, there was not enough time for the explosives to detonate. On the first day that the Red Army occupied Kexholm, they removed more than 500 catties of explosives. These explosives were enough to completely destroy the factory and turn it to ashes. According to a Finnish deserter, 'After the establishment of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, the Finnish White Guard organized special teams to carry out the destruction of factory machines and objects inside the buildings. Kexholm is no exception. All the generators, etc., in the Haru weaving factory were completely destroyed. In addition, part of the Lierikla paper mill was destroyed. This work was all carried out by special agents organized by the Finnish White Guard.

The destruction work in Enso was even more insidious. Although the exterior of the Enso paper mill did not show any damage, the interior was also cunningly damaged by special agents. Since there was no fighting near Enso, the factory could have been handed over to the Soviet Union. However, before withdrawing, the Finnish side also destroyed it. As for the machinery of the factory, it was taken away by the Finnish side. The Finnish side also believed that the machinery would not be easily restored. Undoubtedly, the factory was destroyed after the signing of the peace treaty, and the extent of the damage was not easy to detect, but it made it impossible for the factory to resume work. According to eyewitnesses, when the Red Army occupied Enso, a large number of factory machines were piled up on the Finnish border.

An annex to the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty published on March 13 stated the following provisions: 'First, the commanders of both sides agree to take necessary steps during the troop withdrawal to prevent the destruction of cities and buildings of defensive and economic nature, such as bridges, water gates, airfields, barracks, military depots, railway junctions, industrial facilities, telegraphs and power plants.' What we want to know is, who allowed the Finnish side to destroy the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty so unreasonably? According to the treaty, our commanders have returned Petsamo to Finland in its original condition, with the streets and houses all repaired. Moreover, when the treaty annex was signed, the Red Army command had restored the work of the telegraph and telephone bureau, the power plant, and the water plant in the Petsamo area. The above-mentioned industries and the shipyard in Linankhamari were handed over to the Finnish army and were all in very good condition. How could the Finnish commanders allow their subordinates to carry out destruction work in the areas handed over to the Soviet Union? Has the Finnish side fulfilled its promises? The newspaper published photos of the destruction situation at the Kexholm factory as evidence." (TASS dispatch of the 7th)

### After Naval Exercises, the US Fleet Remains Stationed in the Hawaiian Area, Taking Precautionary Measures for the Dutch East Indies, Warning Japan Not to Take Action

Honolulu: It was announced here last night that the U.S. fleet will remain indefinitely in Hawaiian waters. U.S. Fleet Commander Admiral Richardson stated that the Navy Department has approved his plan to keep the U.S. fleet in the Hawaiian area for further tactical exercises. It is said that "the U.S. fleet will leave Pearl Harbor next week and go to the Lahaina area for exercises." The peacetime organization of the Hawaiian fleet consists of 20 destroyers and 8 cruisers. (Associated Press dispatch of the 8th)

Washington: The news that the U.S. Navy Department announced that the exercise fleet would remain stationed in Hawaii has surprised Washingtonians and sparked various rumors. The U.S. fleet currently exercising in Hawaii has a total of 90 warships, including two aircraft carriers and 11 battleships. Political figures speculate that the reason why the U.S. military ordered the fleet to remain in the Pacific is because of various rumors regarding the future of the Dutch East Indies, and thus precautionary measures are being taken. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 8th)

Washington: Although official sources here indicate that the long-term stationing of the U.S. fleet in Hawaiian waters is for training purposes, diplomatic observers believe that this action by the United States is clearly a political act, intended to warn Japan not to take any actions that could be considered belligerent. Diplomatic observers cite recent remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Hull that any attempt to change the status quo of the Dutch East Indies would endanger peace in the Pacific as proof. Senator William King, a Democrat from Utah, actively supports the long-term stationing of the U.S. Navy in Hawaii. King stated that the United States has the right to station its fleet in the Pacific when necessary. No one can question the legitimacy of this action by the United States. The U.S. fleet, no matter where it is stationed, has nothing to do with Japan unless it is in Japanese territorial waters. King also stated that we have obtained much evidence regarding Japan's attempt to expand its influence in the East. If U.S.-Japan relations can be improved, we certainly do not want to express opinions against Japan. However, the stationing of the U.S. fleet in Hawaii should not hinder the improvement of U.S.-Japan relations. Presidential secretary Ely reportedly told the chief executive yesterday that the U.S. fleet will remain in Hawaii indefinitely. Naval experts point out that the decision to keep the U.S. fleet stationed in Hawaii long-term was made when the European war expanded. (Associated Press dispatch of the 8th)

Washington: U.S. Secretary of the Navy Edison urged Congress yesterday at the Senate Naval Committee to vote on a bill to build 300,000 tons of warships during this session. He stated, in brief, that large warships have always been the backbone of naval fleets. No matter how air power develops, the experience gained in the Norwegian naval battles does not necessarily mean that large warships have lost their effectiveness. Norwegian harbors are narrow, so British large warships could not exert their power and encountered German aircraft bombing. The large warships built in the United States are prepared for various bases in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 8th)

Washington: U.S. Secretary of the Navy Edison said in a speech to the Senate Naval Committee yesterday that the United States will still need warships as the backbone of its national defense in the coming years. He also said that he had learned from reliable sources that German aircraft had not sunk any British battleships in the recent European war. All U.S. warships are the best of the warship structures known to us, and there are constant improvements, comparable to the current air force. (Associated Press dispatch of the 8th)

### France Stops Selling Nickel and Iron to Japan

Paris: Sources close to the authorities here claim that the French government has stopped selling nickel from New Caledonia and iron ore from Vietnam to Japan in order to reserve essential military materials. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th)

### Military Setbacks in Norway, British House of Commons Opens a Major Debate: Opposition Parties Accuse the Government of Mismanagement, Demanding That the Current Policy Be Put to a Vote

London: The opposition Labour Party parliamentary group held a meeting at 11:30 this morning, chaired by party leader Major Attlee, to discuss the political situation. It lasted for more than an hour and then concluded. It was immediately decided that when the House of Commons convenes this evening, it will demand that the government's policies be put to a vote. There are two ways to do this: (1) Introduce a motion of no confidence in the current cabinet; (2) Express opposition to the government's motion to adjourn the House. "In order to take into account the feelings of government-affiliated members who are still unwilling to openly condemn the government, the Labour Party may adopt the second method to express dissatisfaction with the current cabinet. However, the government can still obtain the support of a majority of votes." (Havas dispatch of the 8th)

London: After British Prime Minister Chamberlain finished speaking in the House of Commons yesterday, opposition Labour Party leader Major Attlee, opposition Liberal Party leader Sinclair, and Conservative Party member Admiral Keyes all delivered speeches criticizing all the facilities of the government in the Norwegian war. The speeches of the three gentlemen are recorded below.

### Attlee: Pointing out Weaknesses

When Major Attlee spoke, he first warmly praised the British, French, and Norwegian troops, expressed sympathy for the Norwegian people, and admired the skill of carrying out the withdrawal in difficult circumstances. Attlee continued, "We already have experience in withdrawing troops during the last war. This time, it is even more difficult due to aerial attacks. This is truly an astonishing war record. However, in the final analysis, this is a retreat. The Prime Minister's speech on Thursday seemed overly optimistic and satisfied, while Churchill's speech was even more optimistic. Although the Prime Minister advised us not to make hasty judgments, it is useless. There are already some very hasty judgments in the speeches of the Prime Minister and the First Lord of the Admiralty. In terms of the facts, it is difficult to say that this war is beneficial to our side, as the Prime Minister said on Thursday. The Prime Minister's tone has changed today, with various excuses and explanations. We are certainly unwilling to give our enemies ammunition, but we have a responsibility to the people of our country to study the various things that have happened. We must deal with the facts, and we are not afraid of the facts. The fact now is that it is a setback. Cabinet members are full of hope in their speeches to journalists and on the radio. I think it is a mistake to speak to the public and encourage them to have the illusion that everything is going exceptionally well and to excite their spirits. I think the authorities should not do this, but should provide more guidance. We are now feeling pain because disappointment has occurred after great expectations. We all know that we must keep in mind the needs of a larger strategy, but this does not mean that we should launch a military expedition that retreats at the slightest touch.

Never Took the Initiative

The initial general opinion was that Germany had stuck its head out to be struck, and that Britain had the opportunity to launch a war. What is even more disappointing now is precisely because of this. We hear that our side has never taken the initiative in this war, and there is no real plan to prevent possible attacks by the enemy. The government did have the idea of using mines to block the Narvik route, but the extreme possibility of a German counterattack was clearly visible. What preparations did the government make for this possibility? This is the first question. The Prime Minister once said that Germany, with great caution, spent a long period of time planning the expedition to Norway. Then, what was the caution of the Allied forces in their plan to defeat this German offensive? In March, the government told people that 100,000 soldiers were prepared to go to Finland, and stated that this army was fully prepared. If so, then we want to know where this army is now. The Finnish war ended in March, and the government's decision to lay mines off the coast of Norway on April 8 was made after the end of the Finnish war. I think if the government intended to lay mines, it should have retained this army to prevent a German counterattack. So, why did the government immediately disperse this army at that time? This is what I am very confused about. I heard that some troops have been kept intact, then I want to know if these troops are fully equipped, and if they have the necessary equipment and the ships and aircraft needed for transportation. I want to know even more if this army is an excellent army. I once heard that we had a batch of trained soldiers who could ski, prepared to participate in the Finnish war, but then I heard that the army had been dispersed and assigned to other tasks. When there was a possibility of war in Norway, why was this army dispersed? The people are now asking why this army should go to Norway. I have heard that those sent to Norway are poorly trained young people. The climate in Norway is extremely cold, and those who should be sent are experienced, older soldiers, not young people. In the past, we sent young people to the Dardanelles, which made them unable to withstand the war. The previous experience is still there, so what is needed now is people who are adapted to various climates. As for the fact that the Germans expected the British to take mine-laying action and invaded Norway, what kind of information did the government receive from informants?

Strategic Blunder

According to the Prime Minister's previously published remarks, we have long known that German and transport ships have repeatedly conducted boarding exercises, and there are four or five countries that Germany may launch an aggression against, making it difficult to determine for a while. I certainly know that it is extremely difficult to obtain information in Germany, but we can assert that we must have an intelligence agency in Norway. Therefore, it is hard to believe that we heard nothing about this careful plan that has been going on for many months in Norway and Denmark. I want to know if we have obtained any information and whether we have made proper use of the information we have obtained. As far as I know, we have been preparing for many years for the German General Staff's plan to occupy Norway. I want to know if we have taken all steps to counter it.

The question that immediately caught my attention was the issue of strategically important bases. The first condition is that they must not be threatened by air and sea. The time factor is also extremely important. German troops only dispatched a small number of troops to land at certain selected locations. If they have sufficient time, they will continue to send reinforcements, making it extremely difficult for Allied troops to land. The most important thing at the moment is to obtain an air force base. Although this is a dangerous action, it must be taken at the risk. I want to know if the government made a decision early on or acted hastily on a temporary basis. In fact, Narvik is indeed important, but Stavanger or Trondheim are truly important locations. Judging from the situation, the government still does not seem to recognize the importance of air power until after the fact. I am very disturbed by what the Prime Minister said. Although the government has witnessed the lessons learned from Poland and Finland, it does not seem to have recognized the importance of air defense.

Cannot Deny Delay

What I am asking now is whether action was taken in time. The landing of German troops in Trondheim was more than ten days away from the landing of our troops in Namsos and Andalsnes. It is questionable to what extent the government carried out plans and maintained troops to cope with this contingency. Since we cannot obtain an air force base, withdrawal is inevitable, but the fact that the South Norwegian military failed cannot be changed because of this. Some say that we can start again and attack from Narvik, which is extremely difficult in fact. In addition, it is also of military importance to prevent German reinforcements. Although we cannot prevent German reinforcements in the air, we have more optimistic hopes for the actions of the naval fleet. When we consider the time when this withdrawal began, there is an important factor, which is the degree to which we can successfully prevent enemy reinforcements. We must also admit that the combined defense capabilities that the Norwegian people can launch are still unknown. In my opinion, our plan does not seem to have been considered in advance with clever foresight. We lack sufficient alertness and lack the necessary concentration on various major objectives. I don't know if there will be delays and discussions at any time when action is needed.

I am still not satisfied with the Prime Minister's various claims that the current wartime cabinet is an efficient tool for carrying out the war. This House has repeatedly criticized it. The remarks of other experienced people, and newspapers and platforms, have also criticized it as having erroneous cabinet principles. If victory can be achieved now, there is still something to say, but this victory has not been achieved. I frankly admit that it is not appropriate for Churchill to serve as both First Lord of the Admiralty and Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee.

At this point in Attlee's speech, the Prime Minister interjected that Churchill would not serve as chairman and would not attend every meeting of the Chiefs of Staff. Attlee continued, "It is against all the conventions of military strategy and organization to have a person in charge of important military affairs at the same time directing a special part of it. Churchill already has various great difficulties, and now it is unfair to put him in an impossible position."

Your Leadership is Unreliable

Attlee added, "We are now facing a decisive defeat, and our friends are disappointed by it. But we have had repeated failures in the past, and I have never wavered in my belief that we will win. (Cheers from the crowd) When we encounter failures, we must learn from them, which is extremely important. (Cheers from the crowd) I firmly believe that the courage and perseverance of the people of the country only need proper leadership. (Cheers from the opposition) People in our country, no matter what their views or thoughts, are not anxious and believe that the war is not being carried out with sufficient energy and determination. If the government has not heard of this, it must be both blind and deaf. The government has taken various inappropriate actions, and the Norwegian matter is only the most recent. It is said that those who bear the main administrative responsibility have a history of almost uninterrupted failures. (Cheers from the opposition) Norway, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and any other place have all failed because they were 'too late'. The Prime Minister mentioned 'missing the train', but in fact, the government has missed the train more than once since 1931. What they missed was the peace train, and what they boarded was the war train.

The judgments of the government officials are always wrong. They believe that Hitler would not attack Czechoslovakia and that Hitler could be subdued. They also seem not to have anticipated Hitler's invasion of Norway. In short, they have failed to grasp the facts and deal with them everywhere. This is not only the case in national defense and diplomacy, but also in the domestic situation. To this day, the government has not adjusted the country's resources. Eight months after the war began, all of these events should have been held, but to this day, there has been no organization of food or manpower. This is due to a lack of effective leadership. The morale of the whole country has a backlash.

The Times editorial said that the Prime Minister's weakness lies in being attached to colleagues who have either failed or need to rest. Know that at this critical moment of life and death, we cannot let our destiny be manipulated by those who have already failed or need to rest. I am not sure if the Prime Minister has this weakness, but the government-affiliated members do have this weakness. It is not that they have not seen the repeated failures, but they know it and still tolerate it. They would rather let their loyalty to the party leader obliterate their loyalty to the country's true needs. (Cheers from the opposition) The House must take on the entire responsibility at this point. The whole country now holds a certain victory, but if you want to win, those who wield the national reins must be replaced, and be different from the people who led us into this crisis. (Cheers from the crowd)

### Sinclair's Eloquent Speech

Following the Free Party's Sinclair, who began his speech with words of admiration for the bravery of the Allied forces in Norway, he then said that he did not find it strange that the Chief of Staff felt anxious about possible developments in the debate. However, he regretted that the Prime Minister had already stated that the debate must be absolutely free, and there should be no suggestions from external parties, the military, or any other source as to how the debate should proceed. Regarding the government's decision to withdraw troops from Norway, Attlee had already criticized it, and he did not want to continue with the criticism. He had heard that the government's decision was based on the Chief of Staff's advice that there was no hope of successfully capturing Trondheim. From his perspective, it was right for the government to act on the advice of its military advisors in this situation. What we want to criticize and investigate now is the question of how we reached this point where we have to admit failure in Norway. Although this is not a major military defeat, and does not shake our confidence in the courage and efficiency of our troops, it shows that in the highest guidance of our war effort, there must be a broader vision, greater boldness, and a stronger determination.

Hiding One's Head in the Sand

Although the military impact of our failure in Norway cannot be compared to what we encountered in the last great war, it is enough to make people unhappy. I do not want to exaggerate, but we must face the facts and not bury our heads in the sand. The number of casualties is not negligible, and the loss of materials is not insignificant. We have lost some war equipment, several warships, and the current supply of these materials is temporarily insufficient. The military impact is like this, and the impact in other areas is even more serious. The Prime Minister did not say a word about the economic aspects of this matter. In fact, we have lost various supplies from Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and the Baltic countries. The Baltic Sea is now blocked, and we can no longer access it. The 570,000 tons of ore that we transported from Narvik will probably also be cut off in the future. When we recapture Narvik in the future, we will see that the Germans have destroyed all the valuable items there.

Weakened International Prestige

In terms of diplomacy, our position in various countries around the world has been weakened by the military failure in Norway. It is pathetic to compare the unfounded self-satisfied remarks made by some of our cabinet members with the solid and rapid blows made by the enemy's troops. In war, it is the results that count, not empty words. Our newspapers and broadcasts have also been severely hit. The Prime Minister blamed the news from Stockholm for being too embellished. I also believe that the news from Stockholm is confusing, but British journalists, reporters from British territories, and foreign journalists have all accused me of the misleading nature of some of the communiqués. The communiqués praised the success of the troop landings, leading to optimism about everything going well. Even people in the news media were misled about the true situation.

Lack of Preparation in Everything

In the economic, political, propaganda, and military aspects, we have failed everywhere. The main reason for this is that our war effort has not been supported and promoted with a fully determined war spirit in all departments and policies. If the British army had been prepared early, it should have arrived in Norway within ten days, before the German army arrived with its planes. We should have had a strong army ready to move out immediately. We knew the truth of the crisis early on, and we should have made declarations to neutral countries about the preparations they should be making and the genuine assistance we were willing to provide them. But we had no such preparation. The key to the situation was not Narvik, but Trondheim, because Trondheim is a strategically important point where victory or defeat is determined. Now that the German army has occupied it, the best gateway for Britain to enter Norway is now closed. If the occupation of Trondheim had been made impossible, then the Norwegian Expeditionary Force should not have been dispatched. If the occupation of Trondheim was possible, then the dispatch of the expeditionary force should have been supported with an unwavering determination.

The Enemy and Us Compared

Although Germany has sacrificed one-third of its fleet, its fleet has helped it achieve a victory that the German navy has never had before. The Prime Minister criticized Germany for disregarding the lives of its soldiers when deploying reinforcements, but the German losses in the Skagerrak battle, estimated at 10,000, must be an overestimate. However, the cost of a new type of battle for this victory is not too great a sacrifice. The German army advanced aggressively from Oslo, while our army lingered outside Trondheim.

Troops Not Fully Equipped

Those who should have been sent to Norway were well-trained soldiers, not local troops. Attlee has already spoken about this in detail, and I agree with him. I cannot remain silent about the government's failure to provide this army with equipment such as snowshoes. In one place, two anti-aircraft guns were transported ashore, but there were no suitable gun mounts, no suitable gunners, and no instruments for indicating the trajectory of the shells, rendering the two anti-aircraft guns completely useless. Furthermore, one transport ship did not have an accurate clock, nor a barometer or an international code book. The ship was not equipped with weapons, not even rifles, and the food it carried was insufficient. There were some wounded soldiers on board, but no medical care. The arrangement was so poor.

Finally Speaking of Sweden

Sinclair spoke to this point, and Naval Secretary Churchill rose to ask a question. Sinclair replied that he would secretly tell the Naval Secretary the name of the ship. Sinclair finally spoke of Sweden, saying that it would be expected that Sweden would receive an 'aide-mémoire' within one or two weeks. Now that Sweden has been surrounded, it is unknown whether Britain can still help Sweden resist German aggression. Time is not on our side, Hitler has already grabbed the old man's beard. If we want to win, we must be as quick in spirit and action.

### Keyes Defends the Navy

Admiral Keyes stood up in uniform, and the crowd responded with cheers. Keyes said that some people had suggested that the British Navy had fled to Alexandria, which was a heinous insult (the crowd laughed, and the Speaker also echoed). He then said that it was not the Navy's fault that the British Navy did not follow the German warships and transports into the Norwegian ports and destroy them, as was done in Narvik. He meant that the difficulty of the Navy attacking Trondheim was minor compared to the difficulties overcome in other battles he had previously organized and commanded. This can be supported by the intelligence responsible for Norway. Since April 16, he had been urging the Admiralty to take more aggressive action in Norway, and to give him full responsibility for organizing and leading the attack. The Admiralty told him that there was no difficulty in sailing into Trondheim Bay, that the army was making good progress, so there was no need for the Navy, and that the overall situation in the Mediterranean was urgent, so they did not want warships to risk fighting in Trondheim. He also suggested that old warships be used for this operation, so that even if there were losses, they would not affect the strength of the fleet.

### Amery Advocates Government Reorganization

Following, Conservative Party MP Amery rose and said that the entire war operation, as far as is known, should be thoroughly investigated (the crowd cheered). Today, there is no other loyalty than loyalty to the common cause (the whole house cheered). He felt that there was not a word in the Prime Minister's speech to indicate that the government had foreseen what Germany intended to do, or had made a clear decision when it knew what Germany was doing, or had taken swift or resolute action in the overall tragic event. The page of the Norwegian war is not a single page, but is related to the denial of Finland's request for military assistance and the hesitation and slowness in dealing with various war problems. There is no doubt that the gap between the German and our forces in the past eight months has widened. We cannot do anything with what we are doing now, so it must be reformed (the opposition party cheered loudly). The next blow could happen at any time, either in the Netherlands or in the Mediterranean, which cannot be predicted. We must quickly establish the highest war command, and we must have a proper war cabinet like the Lloyd George cabinet in the last great war. The opposition party should earnestly take on their true responsibilities and form a truly united national government. Now is the time.

### War Secretary Stanley Ends the Debate

War Secretary Stanley spoke to end the first day of the debate, saying that he thought the public had a wrong impression of what the Prime Minister had said in the House about the Chief of Staff. In replying to the responsibility for the Norwegian war, the War Secretary said that it was futile to exaggerate the setbacks of our army in the past few weeks, and that it would be ridiculous to call it a disaster, but it would be equally dangerous to despise it, and equally dangerous to falsely claim that the losses of personnel and war materials were small, or that the losses of prestige and morale were not great. He felt that the shock to the whole country was increased because people mistakenly believed the various unfounded news spread by newspapers and radio, and had the idea that our army was winning. This is very true. As for the part where our army won, anyone who looks at the map calmly cannot believe it is true. The communiqués issued by the War Office did not exaggerate the war situation. Every time a communiqué was issued by the War Office, it was carefully drafted, with the aim of not making the public optimistic, or making them think that our army had already won, because in fact we had not won. Unexpectedly, the public still has false optimism, which is really regrettable. The War Secretary then reiterated what the Prime Minister had said about disbanding the Finnish Expeditionary Force, and asked the House to understand that although the government's thoughts were completely focused on Norway today, in the past few weeks or months, the places at risk were not only Finland. The government had received news early on that German warships were ready to depart, which was certainly true. It was also clear that Germany's attack on Norway was a possibility, and even more so. I must now frankly admit that I, like my government colleagues, was told that the German attack would be launched in southern Norway, not in the ports of western Norway. If you want to attack the government, then you should at least consider the situation in which Norway asked for help. We ask ourselves why our intelligence did not clearly make us know Germany's plans, or know Norway's position. The content of Germany's plans was not easy to know, almost as if they wanted to get news here. The Norwegian government knew nothing of Germany's plans. Until April 9, the overall situation in Norway suddenly changed greatly, and even before asking for our help, all the ports, airfields, and arsenals in the country had been surrendered. We sent troops to land in various places, not blindly unaware of the difficulties, nor blindly unaware of the difficulties in the sky, because Norway had no airfield available for us to use. Politically speaking, it can be said that because our army landed in Norway, we have lost prestige in the world, but what we have lost is not much. If our army had not tried to land in Norway, then the prestige lost would have been even greater (Reuters dispatch on the 8th).

### British House of Commons Second Day of Debate Chamberlain Accepts Labour Challenge Morrison Claims Prime Minister, Chancellor, and Air Secretary Are Incompetent

London Today, when the House of Commons continued to debate the Norwegian incident, the Labour opposition party moved to take a vote on the government's war attitude to test the mood of the House. Prime Minister Chamberlain accepted, and cheers erupted at the time. This challenge motion was put forward by Labour MP Morrison. After Morrison attacked the government's mismanagement of the Norwegian war, he pointed out that Chamberlain, Simon (Chancellor), and Hoare (Air Secretary) were not up to the job. These three had not avoided the war, and anyone who was responsible was huge, and declared that the Labour opposition party would test the House's support tonight. After Morrison finished his speech, the Prime Minister jumped up and said, "Morrison's remarks a moment ago forced me to make one or two interventions at this stage. The seriousness of the matter at the beginning of Morrison's speech, the challenge he made to the entire government, and the attack he made on government officials, especially myself, have made the incident even more serious. As the leader of the government, I naturally accept the basic responsibility for the government's actions, and my colleagues do not hesitate to accept their responsibility for the government's actions. However, the seriousness of the matter is not due to human reasons. If we all lose the trust of this House, none of us are willing to remain in office for a moment. The seriousness of the matter is really because I warned the House yesterday that this is a day of national crisis. We are now facing a brutal enemy and must fight it with the united action of the whole country. It is right to attack the government, and I do not want to avoid responsibility. However, I must tell this House that I have many friends in this House (the government party cheered loudly), that no government can conduct war effectively without the support of the public and Parliament. I now accept the challenge, and I certainly welcome it. At least because of this move, who supports us and who opposes us can be distinguished. I would like to ask my friends to support us in tonight's movement (the crowd cheered loudly).

London Today, when the House of Commons began the second day of the Norwegian war debate, London Labour Secretary Morrison earnestly stated the seriousness of the Norwegian incident, saying that if we severely criticize the government's mismanagement and involve certain people, it is definitely not because of party prejudice. Anyone who helps to achieve victory, I will praise him. The deeper the debate goes, the more I feel that the cabinet members' perfunctory handling of affairs should be severely condemned. What is especially regrettable is that Naval Secretary Churchill is responsible for the major war affairs, and will now make the final speech so that the evidence he presents will not be commented on. Morrison also said that it was a shocking act to disperse the expeditionary force that was being prepared to go to Finland. He did not know whether the government had attached importance to the assurances given to Norway, considering it an important part of our war effort, or just fulfilling a moral obligation to avoid being criticized. Morrison asked, When did the government first learn that Germany was planning to attack Norway and Denmark? When did the first information about the German transport fleet's actions reach us? How long was it from the arrival of the information to the real action? Morrison also mentioned the laying of mines in Norwegian territorial waters, saying that it was very unwise to let Hitler know in advance what we were going to do before doing what we wanted to do. The government should have measured the shipyards, harbors, bays, and airfields early so that it would know where to use troops and arrive there quickly. Judging from the current situation, it seems that no such work has been done (to be continued) (Reuters dispatch on the 8th).

### Chamberlain's Full Speech (Continued)

There is one more thing that cannot be forgotten, that is, transporting British and French troops requires many ships, and the ships must be prepared for a long time to be used. The Germans cannot use their ships on the high seas and can let their ships wait for a long time until they think the time is ripe to invade neutral countries, but we are in a different situation. We can use every ton of shipping space to transport food, raw materials, armaments, and war materials to this country, and there is absolutely no reason to prepare ships for a long time to wait for an expedition to the Scandinavian Peninsula or a possible opportunity. We have indeed prepared some troops to occupy some Norwegian ports after Germany violates Norwegian neutrality. We had reason to believe at the time that it was necessary to send a relatively small number of troops to occupy these ports before the main force landed. After occupying the ports, although they cooperated with the troops landed in Namsos and Åndalsnes, the military strength was ultimately too weak to restore their position. Finally, the question arose as to whether we should withdraw our troops since we felt that the battle of Trondheim could not be sustained for long, or whether we should send reinforcements to try again. I think it is right to send reinforcements to attack again, and it is also justifiable to withdraw troops when the attack plan clearly has no hope of success (the crowd cheered).

There Are Two Reasons for the Setback

There are two reasons for this failure: one is that we failed to obtain airfields for our fighter planes to use, and the other is the speed at which German reinforcements arrived. We often thought that if our army could land, it would not be greatly affected by the air strikes. In fact, this expectation was correct, but our fighter planes' failure to operate on the front line allowed the enemy to destroy our transportation and prevent the advance of reinforcements, while the enemy's own transportation allowed the enemy's reinforcements to arrive continuously and eventually gain the upper hand. At this point, the situation was clear. If we wanted to maintain our army in Trondheim, we would have to allocate a very large part of our entire resources, concentrating soldiers, war materials, and fighter planes, which would be possible later. We decided that it would be better to fight with greater strength and greater effect in other parts of Norway. Fortunately, with the skills and courage of all parties, our army successfully withdrew from the Trondheim area. I have now answered the important points of criticism. As for technical issues, such as the organization and equipment of our army, I will leave it to my colleagues to explain in detail. However, I would like to make a general observation to the House:

It Is Too Early to Say Who Will Win

First, I ask members not to rush to judge the results. Germany has indeed won some victories at this time, but it has paid a heavy price (the crowd cheered). It is too early to ask who will win today. The war is not over yet, and most of Norway has not fallen into the hands of the Germans. The Norwegian King and government are still in Norway and will regroup and defend themselves together with the Allied forces. Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht made a broadcast, advising Norwegians to be patient and persevere. His words are indeed important. We should help Norway as soon as possible as we can, but we must not forget that in addition to Norway, there are other fronts that could erupt at any time. Germany, with its large and powerful army, is in a position to attack any point at any time. We must be prepared to deal with attacks from any direction (the meeting place shouted "Pay attention, listen to it"). The more important the point, the more prepared we should be.

Interpretation of Hitler's Missed Train

Cabinet members who express optimism are often considered complacent, while those who do not express optimism are seen as dejected. I strive to walk in the middle (one member shouted "You missed the train"), I do not make excessive expectations that may not be realized (someone shouted "Oh"), nor do I make the people hold infinite joy and sorrow. I said before that Hitler missed the train, and the listeners thought that it referred to the German invasion of Norway. In fact, I made this statement three days before the German invasion of Norway (the listeners laughed). My original intention was that while we were discussing peace, they were already preparing for war. This is where the almighty country takes the lead. At the beginning of the war, the Germans' armaments and equipment were superior to ours. Hitler did not take advantage of this time when the advantages and disadvantages of both sides were most obvious to attack the Allied countries, which is called missing the time. Therefore, I used the metaphor of missing the train. This has nothing to do with the later events, but only a criticism of the previous events.

Avoid Internal Strife in the Face of a Strong Enemy

I think the significance of the Norwegian war has been exaggerated, and I still have complete confidence in the most handsome victory. However, I must say that I think the people of this country have not yet understood the extent and urgency of the threat we are facing (the crowd cheered). If we are not fools, then we should learn many useful lessons from the threat. I am not saying how our future strategy will change, but the Norwegian experience has shown how quickly the landscape changes. Therefore, we should be careful not to be tempted to be distracted, as the enemy wishes. With a strong enemy in front, this is not the time for us to have internal strife (the crowd cheered), but to straighten up our ranks, grit our teeth, do our best, and seek the day of common victory. In this debate, we give assurances for the future. Military advisors solemnly warned us of the danger of holding such a debate and strongly advised against holding such a debate, but we cannot accept their views, because in a democratic country, there must be criticism, and those who are criticized can defend themselves. Four cabinet members who have a direct relationship with the war will now speak. If there is no disclosure, then it is fortunate. Everyone is careful to prevent divisive actions. To say that a certain cabinet member should be more responsible for a certain action is worthless and incorrect. We have no differences with each other, and there is no conspiracy to overthrow each other. We only have one heart and one mind, that is, how to make the best contribution to victory.

Opposition to Changing the Form of the Cabinet

I know that there are people inside and outside Congress who are proposing or demanding a reorganization of the cabinet. I will not speak for the people's problems now, but I cannot remain silent about forming a cabinet that conforms to the law with many years of experience. My colleagues, Churchill and I, all believe that a cabinet composed purely of those without departmental affairs may not save time or have faster decisions, because when making decisions, one must not ignore those who must implement this decision, and those responsible for implementation must attend the meeting to decide the plan and express their opinions. Therefore, there is no real difference between inside and outside the cabinet, and both must bear the responsibility for deciding the plan. My unwillingness to accept the suggestion to change the form of the cabinet does not mean that I am unwilling to change the cabinet members or their positions at any time, as long as I think it is beneficial to the public interest, and I will not resign to give way to the virtuous.

Appeal for Unity to Cope with Difficult Times

I have repeatedly appealed to all parties to do their best at this difficult time and concentrate on improving the war effort (the crowd cheered loudly). Do not be stingy with the form of the government. The output of aircraft, tanks, artillery, armaments, and military supplies, and all kinds of objects that make them suitable, is what we should strive for. We must manufacture these objects with organization, perseverance, and good intentions. As far as we who serve in the government are concerned, we are doing our best to catch up with the starting point that Germany has prepared for many years. We have already obtained the full cooperation of employees and workers today, and I also want to obtain the cooperation of all parties to carry out the work that we all recognize as the most urgently needed at present.

Churchill Has Major Responsibilities

Naval Secretary and Chairman of the Three Services Committee, Churchill, will henceforth be responsible for the special responsibility of daily supervision of military operations, and has been given the power to guide the Chief of Staff Committee. After accepting the position of Chairman of the Cabinet Military Coordination Committee, Churchill, based on his experience, suggested that it would be best if he could have closer contact with the Chiefs of Staff so that he could give the Cabinet more effective assistance. I think Churchill's idea is good, so I discussed it in detail with the three Services Secretaries, and then tried to authorize Churchill by the Cabinet to represent the Military Coordination Committee to guide the Chief of Staff Committee, and to have the Committee prepare plans to carry out its purpose of reporting to Churchill. All Chiefs of Staff retain their collective responsibility to the Cabinet and the Three Services Secretaries, but Churchill will be responsible for the special responsibility of daily supervision of military operations. In this way, we can ensure that all aspects of military policy are studied, and the policies decided are quickly implemented.

Reply to Lloyd George's Question

After the Prime Minister spoke to this point, Lloyd George interjected, Does Churchill retain his current position? The Prime Minister replied, I will let Churchill decide whether he feels that his new job makes it difficult for him to continue to serve as Naval Secretary. The Prime Minister also said that Churchill did not obtain this new power before the Norwegian war occurred. For the above purposes, Churchill will have several personal staff, and this staff will be led by Major General Ismay, the senior staff officer who joined the Chief of Staff Committee (Reuters dispatch on the 7th).

### Roosevelt Prepares to Make Another Plea for Peace, Preventing the Spread of European War to the Mediterranean, Rumor of Another Meeting Between German and Italian Leaders

Washington - It is now increasingly believed here that President Roosevelt will take action related to the war. According to some observers, the White House may take peace initiatives, and the Vatican will issue an appeal at the same time. President Roosevelt stated yesterday that he was drafting a speech for a scientific conference, abruptly breaking the precedent of not meeting with reporters. President Roosevelt dined with Gerard, who served as the US Ambassador to Germany from 1913 to 1917, yesterday. In the afternoon, he met with Welles, the Assistant Secretary of State. President Roosevelt recently met with former Secretary of State Stimson. According to sources close to the White House, President Roosevelt is very concerned about preventing the war from spreading to Italy. (Reuters, 8th)

London - "London Exchange Telegraph" yesterday reprinted a Budapest radio report, stating that Führer Hitler may meet with Prime Minister Mussolini again soon. The report stated that the meeting place for the two Axis leaders will be in Munich or Innsbruck. (Associated Press, 8th)

### British Ambassador to Italy Visits the Italian Prime Minister, Delivering a Letter from Chamberlain

London - Informed sources here recently stated that the United Kingdom's attitude towards the Soviet Union and Italy is mainly based on compromise, but also with a firm attitude. (Havas, 7th)

Rome - According to unconfirmed reports, Sir Noel Charles, the British Ambassador to Italy, immediately visited Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano after returning here from London yesterday. The diplomatic community here was deeply surprised upon hearing the news, believing that Ambassador Charles was likely representing the British government in delivering important documents, or even a letter from Prime Minister Chamberlain, to Prime Minister Mussolini. However, informed sources say that the claim that the ambassador visited Foreign Minister Ciano yesterday may not be reliable. (Havas, 8th)

### The Situation in the Balkans Relaxes, Germany Says It Has No Intention to Invade the Netherlands

Budapest - According to observers here, the situation in Southeast Europe has eased slightly in the past 24 hours. As far as Hungary is concerned, its attitude is in line with the attitude of the German-Italian Axis, and it continues to improve its relations with Yugoslavia. Therefore, Hungarians are not very anxious about the situation. The pro-German "Magyar Nemzet" reported that foreign countries have claimed that Germany is preparing to attack Romania, which is not true. "If Germany had this intention, or asked Hungary to attack Romania, then why would it sell Messerschmitt aircraft and other military equipment to Romania?" (Havas, 8th)

Berlin - German officials recently denied rumors that Germany was about to invade the Netherlands, saying that Germany had no plans to invade the Netherlands. Officials also stated that these rumors arose from the Dutch government's announcement of a special defense plan and the sudden slowdown in traffic between The Hague and Berlin. The general tense atmosphere created by German propaganda activities in the past three days is also the basis for the rumor-mongers. (Associated Press, 8th)

### The Netherlands Takes Precautions, Continues to Draft Naval Reservists, Cancels Soldiers' Leave, Blocks Shipping, and Strictly Controls Telephone Communication with Foreign Countries

The Hague - Yesterday, the government drafted naval reservists from the 1927 and 1928 classes, coinciding with the cancellation of leave for the army, navy, and air force. Some reservists have been ordered to report to the Rotterdam naval headquarters immediately, while others assigned to coastal defense are to report to the Amsterdam naval headquarters. Reservists should also be prepared with full equipment. Officials refused to explain the cancellation of soldiers' leave and the drafting of reservists, only saying that the tense international situation requires neutral countries located among belligerent countries to be prepared for unexpected events at any time. They pointed out that a sudden war will occur in Europe within these few days. Informed circles said that they believed there would be a fierce air battle between Britain and Germany, which would further endanger the status of neutral countries. No facts increasing the direct crisis in the Netherlands have been obtained yet; these measures are just precautionary. (Associated Press, 8th)

The Hague - According to the Director of Shipping, the ports of the Meuse and Rhine rivers will be closed from the 11th to the 13th of this month, prohibiting any ships from entering or leaving. (Havas, 7th)

The Hague - After the military authorities canceled leave for officers and soldiers, officers and soldiers who are currently on leave have already begun to return to their units to cancel their leave. The order is very good. National railway transportation has been dedicated to military use. The number of troops mobilized this time will be unprecedented in Dutch history, and the national economic life will inevitably be affected. As for the preventive measures taken by the navy, they are even more active than the army. Even merchant sailors and fishermen are being drafted. In addition, telephone communication between the Netherlands and foreign countries has been strictly controlled by the authorities, and it was interrupted once from 10:30 pm yesterday to 8:00 am today. According to a "Commercial Report" editorial, the Dutch nation must be prepared to cope with any event and freely take various measures at any time. The Netherlands does not need foreign assistance. (Havas)

### Belgium Prepares for the Worst

Brussels - Regarding the news of the Netherlands' decision to cancel military leave and cut off transportation, Belgium has paid close attention to it. However, Belgium does not intend to take the same measures, because Belgium is confident that its army is sufficient to repel invading enemy troops. Generally, it is determined that a decisive event will occur within days, but the location of its occurrence is guessed differently by everyone. (Haitong, 8th)

### Measures to Suppress Prices to be Implemented by Authorities, Hoarding and Price Gouging Will Be Punished Severely, Efforts to Adjust Food Prices, Price Stabilization Committee of the French Concession Holds General Meeting Today

Since the tightening of foreign exchange on the 2nd of this month, speculators have uniformly raised market prices for domestic products, affecting the livelihood of civilians. According to a member of the Price Stabilization Committee of the French Concession, the Price Stabilization Committee has paid close attention to the high prices of various merchants. Specific measures for price suppression have been drafted by the members of the various subcommittees and will be passed at tomorrow's (9th) general meeting, and then they can be consulted with the Public Concession for implementation. The Price Stabilization Committee has been established for two months, and there have been several cases where merchants have been found to have raised prices after review by the Price Stabilization Committee. They have been fined or warned separately, but their store names have not been published temporarily in order to protect their business reputation. However, if they continue to do evil, further punishment will be given. A member also said that merchants often use the cost of re-purchasing goods as an excuse to refuse to sell, which is not allowed. Therefore, although the exchange rate is tight at this time, there is still the possibility of releasing it in the future. Moreover, the goods that have been purchased are priced when the exchange rate is stable, so it should not be arbitrarily raised. Regarding these main food items, such as rice and coal, because the foreign exchange is a price stabilization price, there are indeed considerable difficulties, but we should always do our best to adjust them. For example, the coal used by the coal industry has been agreed with the Kai Coal Company to supply it at cost price.

Citizens' Suggestions: The Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of this city yesterday approved the following suggestions: The prices of all things are expensive, although they are affected by the war, but the conclusion of the matter lies in the fact that most of them are caused by speculators colluding with certain circles to hoard and monopolize. When the exchange rate rises slightly, the goods purchased in foreign exchange, or when the goods are scarce, are all purchased in large quantities and stacked in warehouses, and then rumors are spread in all directions, either saying that the foreign exchange fund is shaking, or saying that the source of the goods will be cut off. Various circles mistakenly believe it to be true, and one person tells ten, and ten people tell a hundred, and the price of the goods immediately rises. Cunning merchants hide all kinds of goods and hoard them, and well-off families rush to buy and prepare them, even accumulating goods that can be used for more than a year and a half. In less than half a day, the market is empty. The poor workers who work hard all day long, when they return home in the evening and want to buy a few necessities such as rice and coal briquettes, have to run more than ten miles and spend several hours, and still return empty-handed. They have to buy large cakes to fill their stomachs, or split furniture for cooking. Although there are establishments for selling at discounted prices, the time for selling at discounted prices is when the workers are working in the factory, so how can they come in person? If there are old, weak, and young people in the family who go to buy at discounted prices, they have to stand for three or four hours. How can the old, weak, and young people with faces like vegetables endure long-term crowding, and even be injured and fall to the ground? Alas, the hard-working civilians are often cut off from food and cooking, and the hateful speculators have become rich people! Please invite various public groups to organize a price stabilization committee as soon as possible. Its work should first treat the symptoms and then treat the root cause. There are six methods for treating the symptoms: (1) If a person hoards goods and is reported by someone, and the facts are verified, whether it is a warehouse receipt or spot goods, they must be distributed for sale at discounted prices. The payment for the goods will be donated to charitable activities, except for a certain amount to be given as a bonus to the reporter. (2) Anyone who is not a merchant who buys a large amount of goods will be considered hoarding. In short, except for luxury goods, buying too much goods will be subject to the same punishment. (3) After the establishment of the Price Stabilization Committee, all whole goods, if they are concealed or reported less, will be considered hoarding. (4) The names of the owners, the number of goods, and the storage locations of the goods that have long been mortgaged by various banks or stacked in various warehouses must be notified to the association for registration. (5) Goods that have not been approved by the association must not be used as collateral by various banks, and various warehouses are not allowed to store them. If there is a violation of items four and five, it will be considered helping hoarding. (6) Consult with the consuls of various countries to notify the overseas Chinese of their respective countries that they must not protect hoarders or store goods for them. If there is a violation, consult with the officials of that country to handle it in accordance with the penalty rules of our Price Stabilization Committee. If the above six methods can be followed, even if speculators have all kinds of insidious tricks, they will not be able to use their skills.

Rice Industry Resolution: The two associations of the bean and rice industry, grocery and oil cake industry in this city held a joint meeting of the supervisory committee of the two associations at the association's headquarters at 3:30 pm yesterday to discuss ways to restrict speculative activities, in accordance with the intention of the two concession authorities to "adjust food to relieve the people's difficulties," and invited representatives of the Rice Market Management Committee to attend to exchange views and cooperate closely. The resolutions are as follows:

Limit Period for Clearing: "The transaction of rice and grain should be based on actual sales as a principle, and must follow the proper order, that is, customers sell to shops, and shops sell to businesses, and must not overstep the rules, which has long been stipulated in the market trading rules. Recently, a small number of people have been buying and selling foreign rice, and do not follow this regulation, transferring and receiving each other, without any restrictions, which is enough to disrupt market prices and affect people's livelihood, which is really wrong. The two associations hereby convened a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees to discuss rectification measures. It is believed that the reason why the above situation occurs is due to the excessive length of the delivery period and the delay in delivery. It has been decided that in order to crack down on speculation outside the industry and eliminate short selling, from the 10th of this month, whether it is domestic rice or foreign rice (with 160 catties as a unit), the payment must be made with the bill of lading within five days from the date of transaction at the latest, and the goods must be weighed and cleared within ten days. Otherwise, the foreign rice will be paid in full according to the original weight on the English book, and the Hong Kong rice and domestic rice will be paid in full according to the cost list. However, for fear that the weight may be insufficient when weighing, the seller will deduct two catties per bag to compensate the buyer.

Facilitate Retail Sales: For goods traded before the 10th of this month, except for the payment period in accordance with the regulations, they must all be weighed and cleared before the 20th of this month, otherwise they will be handled in accordance with the above regulations. In order to facilitate the retail sale of foreign rice, the industry is notified that if there are transactions of thirty to fifty bags, they should also be sold, but if the payment must be made before weighing, the seller may issue a delivery voucher. In addition to the announcement, the above resolutions will also be reported to the authorities of the two concessions for record.

### British Army East Surrey Regiment War Fund

Concert at the Lyceum Theatre, proceeds from ticket sales remitted to England

The East Surrey Regiment of the British Defense Force stationed in Shanghai will hold a concert at the Lyceum Theatre at 9:15 pm this Saturday, and the proceeds from ticket sales will be remitted to the home country to fund the British wartime central fund.

### Do Not Forget the National Humiliation of May 9th, Citizens Will Stop Entertainment and Banquets Today, Practice Thrift, Relief, and National Construction Savings

Today is the "May 9th" National Humiliation Memorial Day. The Central Government originally intended this memorial day to make the public not forget the Japanese people's ambition to invade China, but since the July 7th Incident, the whole country has been in the process of resisting the war, and it has been stipulated that July 7th is the Anti-Japanese War Memorial Day. Therefore, it has been decided to abolish this "May 9th" National Humiliation Memorial Day. In this special environment, all walks of life in this city have not been extravagant in the past two years, and only spiritually commemorate this festival. Now that the Central Government has explicitly ordered the abolition, it has been decided to stop all unnecessary activities, but automatically stop entertainment and banquets to show that we do not forget the national humiliation, and at the same time practice thrift, relief, and national construction savings.

### Chambers of Commerce and Others Received a Telegram from the Ministry of Finance Resolving to Maintain Monetary Confidence, the Exchange Market is Becoming More Stable, Public Bonds are Becoming More Popular, and the Run on Deposits Has Completely Subsided

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, and the Money Dealers' Association received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, reiterating their determination to maintain monetary confidence and stabilize finance. As for the restriction on withdrawals, there is no such thing. The original telegram was seen in yesterday's (8th) newspaper and will not be repeated here.

The Exchange Market is Easing and People's Hearts are Settled: A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the financial market yesterday that the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai yesterday, HSBC Bank's listing price remained unchanged, and the actual transaction price was easing. The dark market for gold and foreign currencies has stabilized, the stock market is slightly bullish, unified bonds are slightly popular, cotton yarn, rice, oil, and foreign stocks have all fallen back, and the Ministry of Finance's telegram to Shanghai declaring its determination to maintain the monetary system, stabilize finance, and restrict deposits has completely quelled the rumors and stabilized people's hearts. The run on deposits in various banks and shops has completely subsided.

The Lucky Speculation Needs to Be Corrected: In fact, today's Shanghai has lost its position as the national financial center. Under the control of evil forces, the public listing price of foreign exchange in the local area is no longer a true and fair listing price. Moreover, the rise and fall of the exchange rate is no longer subject to economic forces. The buying and selling of foreign exchange is just the game of speculators. On the one hand, it is encouraged by rumors, and on the other hand, it follows this group of people to the place, suddenly shrinking, then collecting all the strength, and suddenly growing, then dumping everything out. Merchants are bystanders, so the market in Shanghai has become a gambling place for speculators.

### Yesterday Was Mother's Day

Yesterday, "May 8th" was International Mother's Day. Women's groups throughout the city, in view of the importance of maternal education, at this time of war and national construction, in the autumn of national calamity, children's education is extremely important. Only with a good mother can there be excellent citizens, who can later shoulder the responsibility of serving the country. However, due to the special environment, women in the city are encouraged to educate their children not only for the tradition of their own families, but also to know that the children now are the masters of the country in the future. Being a mother, recognizing the meaning of educating children, is to create talents for the country and society, and to work hard for the country and society. We should also correct unreasonable traditional concepts, cultivate the modern mother's love needed, eradicate family thoughts, earnestly take on the responsibility of educating children for the country and society, and strictly teach them in order to cultivate promising young people, fight for freedom and glory for the country and society, and fight for liberation and survival for the nation and the country.

### Ships from Shanghai to Other Ports Must Be Subject to Quarantine Restrictions

### New US Consul General in Shanghai, Lockehead, Arrives in Shanghai, Scheduled to Return to the US for Vacation on the 14th, Will Return to Shanghai in Early Autumn

The English "Great American Evening News" said that the new US Consul General in Shanghai, Lockehead, returned to Shanghai on the 9th on the British transport ship "Henderson", and will take the President Coolidge ship to the United States for vacation with his wife on the 14th. His son is studying at Princeton University and will graduate this summer. Mr. and Mrs. Lockehead will attend the graduation ceremony. It is expected that Mr. and Mrs. Lockehead will return to Shanghai in early autumn. Other foreigners who will take the President Coolidge ship back to the United States include Mrs. Heard, wife of the Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, and her two daughters, the Mexican chargé d'affaires Amado and his family, etc.

### Young and Strong Refugees Are All Dispersed

Limited to the end of this month, the required cost is 300,000 yuan

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association is responsible for supplying food to refugees in various places in the city. Due to soaring prices, it feels very difficult. In order to save expenses, after discussion with various charities, it is actively dispersing young and strong refugees. Such as the Shanghai International Relief Committee, the Tzu Lien General Association and its branches, and the first reception center directly under the association entrusted to the Salvation Army, all started to handle it last month, or have been dispersed, or are still in progress. It is reported that the association yesterday also notified various refugee shelters that refugees, except for the old, weak, disabled, widows, and orphans, should all leave the center before May 31, in order to leave 20,000 refugees. Each person will be given a dispersal fee of 15 yuan, which requires a total dispersal fee of 300,000 yuan, all of which will be paid by the association. At the same time, the remaining old, weak, disabled, widows, orphans, and those who have no home and no ability to produce will have to be kept for a long time. The number of people is still difficult to determine. Therefore, the association authorities still hope that benevolent people will push clothes to feed and continue to sponsor.

### Japanese Fleet Commander Shimada Takes Office

The position of Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Navy in China has recently been reassigned to Vice Admiral Shigetaro Shimada. Shimada went to the flagship "Izumo" in the Huangpu River at 8:30 am on the 7th to formally complete the handover with the outgoing Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Koshirō Oikawa, and immediately took office, and issued the following statement: "The blockade of the transportation of Chinese public and private ships along the coast of China implemented by the former Commander-in-Chief of the China Fleet, Oikawa, will be continued by this Commander-in-Chief after noon on May 7, 'Showa 15'."

### The Poor Children's School Relief Center Broadcasts for Donations

Today, radio stations throughout the city will broadcast special solicitation programs

The Poor Children's School Relief Center in this city has been established for more than two years. Recently, the cost of education for twenty district volunteer primary and secondary schools and more than 1,500 relief students has been greatly affected by abnormal prices, and it is becoming increasingly large. In addition to the National Relief Commission allocating 10,000 yuan from Chongqing to consolidate the relief fund, it has been approved by the Broadcasting Radio Administration and the Public Concession Police Department, and has received enthusiastic assistance from more than ten groups including the Shanghai Private Radio Industry Association and the Shanghai Recreation Association. On May 9, all radio stations throughout the city were ordered to stop broadcasting and only broadcast the center's solicitation program, so that people across the country could listen and the center could stand firm and flourish.

### Danish Ship "Afrika" Captured in Colón, Many Passengers and Goods from This City Aboard, British Prize Court Has Opened Trial

Denmark and Norway, due to the expansion of the European war, Norwegian merchant ships once suspended sailing. After the Norwegian Minister to the United Kingdom negotiated with the British government, Norwegian ships sailed in accordance with British and French wartime rules and obeyed the command of the British Navy. Therefore, they have resumed sailing. Denmark has complied with Germany, resulting in the suspension of overseas trade. Ships that have stopped sailing in the Far East have been captured by the British Navy, and most of them are concentrated in Hong Kong.

Captured and on Trial

It is now heard that the Danish merchant ship "Afrika", managed by Silong Trading Company, came to the Far East from Denmark via Sweden and other ports and arrived at the port of Colón. Just as Denmark was changing, the ship was detained by the British Navy. There were a large number of goods on board transported to Shanghai. After the detention, the goods could not be transported to their destination. The customers in this city who had goods loaded on the ship were very shocked to hear the news of the detention. Recently, it was learned that after the ship was detained in Colón, it has been tried by the British Prize Court several times. The goods on board belong to neutral country customers, so the Colón manager of the ship hired a lawyer to appear in court to defend the customers loading the goods.

Merchant Registration

Baolong Trading Company in this city has received a telegram from Colón, hiring a famous lawyer named Creas. Customers loading goods who need to defend themselves should telegraph the Colón manager for registration before the 15th of this month. Baolong Trading Company has notified customers in this city yesterday and printed an English letter with detailed methods. If there are customers with goods loaded on the ship who have not received the notification, they can read it at the company. As for the goods on board, they will still be stored in the ship and at the customer's convenience. Regarding the loss of this time, it will be handled in accordance with the terms of the bill of lading. The shipowner declares that he is not responsible for anything. It is not yet possible to estimate whether the ship will be permanently detained there or sailed to other ports for mooring.

### French Chief Inspector Pu Lansi Goes to Vietnam to Serve the Country, He Left Shanghai Yesterday Morning to Board a Ship, French Consul General Gives Him an Honorary Certificate

Lieutenant Colonel Pu Lansi, the Chief Inspector of the French Concession Police Department, set off for Vietnam yesterday (8th) morning. Pu will now assist in military affairs in the army in Vietnam. French Consul General Bao Daizhi, in order to reward Pu for his past achievements, presented him with a highly honorary certificate when Pu set off for Vietnam, stating: "For three years, Pu has used his courageous spirit and power to make the police force achieve satisfactory results in the ideal, adding great glory to France. Now Pu leaves the police force to defend the motherland, which is worthy of being an example for us." Pu also received a certificate from Colonel Que Gao Mi in November 1937, which stated: "Lieutenant Pu has been in office for five years, especially during the Shanghai Incident, with his courageous spirit and transcendent wisdom, leading by example and being loyal to his duties, which is worthy of praise." In March 1938, Pu also received a certificate from the French Consul General, which shows that Pu is generally valued by his superiors.

### Coal Briquette Sale at Reduced Prices

Large Coal Briquette Factories Implement Price Reduction Immediately

Since the price of coal briquettes skyrocketed to $9.40 per load, ordinary people have been unable to bear the burden, causing widespread anxiety.

### Far East British Ships Awaiting Requisition

Yee Long Company's Shen Guang Vessel to be Requisitioned and Sail to Hong Kong

To meet wartime needs, the British government has requisitioned several British ships in the Far East and sent them to Hong Kong and British territories in Southeast Asia for use. Since the first of this month, to facilitate requisitioning at any time, Jardine Matheson was ordered to keep all its ships operating in the Far East, except those on the Yangtze River route, ready for requisition. It is understood that all British merchant ships operating in the Far East are now subject to the same restrictions. Yesterday, it was learned that the British Yee Long Shipping Company was recently ordered to requisition ships. The company's Shen Guang vessel is reportedly to be requisitioned and sail to Hong Kong. It has now returned to Shanghai to await orders. The departure date has not yet been determined.

### Paper Merchants Take the Opportunity to Raise Prices

Since the recent fluctuations in the black market exchange rate in this city, speculative merchants have taken the opportunity to raise prices. The price of paper has been rising constantly, especially white paper, which has jumped from over $30 per ream to nearly $50. This has greatly threatened the publishing industry in this city. Yesterday, a member of the paper industry told a reporter from the Ping Ming News Agency that the paper used in this city, except for a small amount of domestically produced paper such as maobian paper from Fujian, is mostly imported from Germany and Norway. Even the paper produced by paper mills in this city depends on foreign countries for pulp. Therefore, the rise in paper prices after the exchange rate decline is only natural. However, the sudden price increase is purely due to speculators hoarding and some paper merchants taking the opportunity to raise prices. Shipments ordered from foreign firms have been arriving in Shanghai continuously recently, and these orders were placed months ago, which has nothing to do with the recent black market exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, warehouses in this city are full of paper. The paper sold on the market now is all old stock, so there is no reason for price increases. However, manufacturers and shops are treating their goods as rare commodities and limiting each customer to no more than two reams of white paper, seemingly indicating a shortage of goods to deliberately raise prices. The hearts of these unscrupulous merchants are truly appalling.

### Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association Begins Recruiting Members

The Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai is recruiting new members for this year, starting on the first of this month. Although there are no accurate statistics, it is estimated that there are about 200,000 Fujianese living in Shanghai. The association's activities, such as promoting education, industry, charity, and hygiene, and promoting economic mutual assistance, have been successful. Its refugee relief efforts after the war have been particularly effective. The association expects a very positive response to this recruitment drive.

### Fire on Touth Island, Wusongkou

According to the English-language "China Press", a fire broke out in the rear residential buildings of the Guanghua Oil Company on Touth Island, Wusongkou, just after 10 PM last night (the 7th). Twelve residences were completely destroyed, but no casualties were reported. The water fire brigade rushed to the scene after receiving the alarm, but the wind fanned the flames, making them extremely intense and impossible to extinguish. Fortunately, the Guanghua Oil Company did not have oil stored when the fire broke out, otherwise the losses would have been even greater. It is learned that the island and its buildings, including the residential buildings and the Guanghua Oil Company's buildings, have been occupied by the Japanese army. However, the Japanese soldiers were unable to put out the fire.

### Sharp Drop in Value of Japanese Currency - Japanese Government Displays Signs of Unease - Sharp Changes in Exchange Market Hurt the Japanese Themselves - Smear Campaign Against Legal Tender Fails to Achieve Results

Since the violent shock to the Shanghai exchange market on the 2nd, Japanese newspapers have been exaggerating and sensationalizing the events, fabricating slanders against the value of legal tender to the extreme. However, according to a certain economist, this kind of wishful thinking that China will fail has completely forgotten that they themselves are deeply mired in a quagmire.

Facts Prove Rumors Are False

(1) The authorities' suspension of black market foreign exchange supply in Shanghai this time is entirely an expedient measure to prevent the Japanese from massive arbitrage and is unavoidable. It is not the government's intention to have speculators fuel the flames. Fortunately, all parties have remained calm, and after a few days, the storm has subsided. (2) The government has telegraphed the Chamber of Commerce and the Bankers' Association, declaring its determination to maintain currency credibility and stabilize finance. All rumors of restrictions on withdrawals, etc., are fabricated by speculators and traitors. Japanese admonitions have been refuted without even attacking them.

Decline in Japanese Currency Affects Exports

The current turmoil has caused the price of Japanese currency in China to fall, which has increased the cost of materials from the occupied areas needed by Japanese domestic industries. The selling price of products cannot but be increased, which is a huge obstacle to its foreign exports and increases the difficulty of absorbing foreign exchange. According to a telegram from the Tokyo branch of the Shanghai Continental News, the Japanese Ministry of Finance is extremely concerned about this and is considering using the funds originally set up for the import of materials from the one-yen group area for adjustment purposes, in order to prevent the rising cost of importing materials from the occupied areas from causing a new trend of price increases for Japanese domestic industrial products. However, those familiar with Japan's financial situation and the inside story of this fund observe that this consideration by the Japanese Ministry of Finance is strong in desire but weak in ability and is unlikely to become a reality. It can be seen that the sharp changes in the exchange market have already caused the Japanese to suffer, and it proves the success of China's policy. In addition, the Japanese have greatly exaggerated the decline in the exchange rate of legal tender, saying that it is due to the depletion of the equalization fund. A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency asked a certain important figure in the financial community about this rumor, who said: The equalization fund consists of 5 million pounds jointly contributed by HSBC and Mercantile Bank of the British side and 5 million pounds jointly contributed by the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank of the Chinese side. The equalization fund is governmental in nature. It purchases legal tender foreign exchange when the exchange rate is too high and sells it when it is too low in order to stabilize the market. We can understand this by considering the literal meaning of "equalization".

Fund Depletion is Pure Fabrication

The participation of HSBC and Mercantile Bank in the equalization fund is still commercial in nature technically, but their funds are guaranteed by the Chinese and British governments. Therefore, the two banks are still operating within the scope of business while stabilizing foreign exchange. For example, when the European war broke out last autumn, a large amount of capital that had fled in the past flowed back to Shanghai. If it were not for HSBC's healthy appetite, the exchange rate would have soared to seven or eight pence at one point. Understanding that the equalization fund has inflows and outflows, it can be known that the statement of fund depletion is pure fabrication.

The Decline in Japanese Currency is Even Stronger in This City

The statement by Japanese newspapers that legal tender is about to collapse is a fabrication and slander. Before the Japanese open their mouths, they should ask themselves about the value of their own currency, instead of making such outrageous statements. Taking North China as an example, the value of "United Reserve Certificates" within the Tianjin concession is still lower than that of legal tender. If "United Reserve Certificates" are remitted to Shanghai, a discount of about 20% is required to exchange for 100 yuan of legal tender. In this city, the Japanese currency not only declined along with the legal tender, but its rate of decline was even greater than that of legal tender. In order to prevent the Japanese puppets from arbitrage and using legal tender to purchase materials overseas, the government has had to let the exchange rate float to its natural level. If artificial methods are used to prevent it, it will not only waste foreign exchange funds, but it will also be tantamount to supplying the Japanese with supplies. The Japanese reasoning is purely inverting cause and effect.

### Employee of Jardine Matheson Embezzles 750,000 - Criminals Chen Ruihua and Lu Ruichang Arrested - 720,000 Yuan in Stolen Money Recovered

Chen Ruihua (20 years old, residing at No. 32, Lane 88, Connaught Road), a Ningbo native, and Lu Ruichang (18 years old, residing at No. 27, Santai Lane, North Baoshan Road) were both employed as collectors and assistant collectors in the comprador's office of Jardine Matheson at No. 27 The Bund. In April of this year, Chen, taking advantage of his position, would only deposit 200 yuan of account receipts for 1,000 yuan, embezzling the remainder. The total amount

Embezzled Gradually

reached a huge sum of 750,000 yuan in national currency. After embezzling the funds, Chen and others used them to engage in stock speculation. Recently, this fraudulent activity was discovered by comprador Pan Zhiquan, who reported it to the General Inspectorate. Detective Kang Zengxiang investigated and found the report to be true. At 6:30 PM the day before yesterday, Chen and Lu were arrested successively.

Stolen Money Recovered

Yesterday, they were escorted to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Attorney Ru Baoyi of the police requested that they be detained, stating that the amount embezzled by the defendants was estimated to be 750,000 yuan. As to whether it exceeded this amount, it

Still Needs to be Investigated

While the stolen money recovered was short 29,175 yuan, 3 jiao, and 6 fen from the estimated 750,000 yuan, this amount also needs to be investigated, etc. When questioned, Chen confessed to embezzlement and speculation, and Lu admitted to being in collusion with him. Judge Qian Hongye verified the confession and ordered that they be detained to await another hearing in a week.

### In the Case of the Assassination of Wu Qilun, the Criminals Falsely Implicate Others - Gu Zhuxuan Denies Instigating the Crime

Gu Zhuxuan and his apprentices Qiao Yaoshan, Zheng Changchun, etc., were implicated as instigators and abettors by the actual assassins of lawyer Wu Qilun, Xia Guifu, Wei Shulin, Wang Xingfang, Xia Shoufeng, etc. They were arrested by the police and charged with instigating murder. Presiding Judge Feng of the First Special Court conducted a preliminary hearing of the criminals, but due to time constraints, a detailed hearing could not be held and was postponed to another date. Details of the hearing have already been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30, Judge Feng reopened the

Criminal Court for Further Hearing

According to Gu Zhuxuan's testimony, "Qiao and Zheng are not actually my students. They are polite to me and call me 'You Sheng' when they meet me. These ignorant people are arrested and cling tightly to me innocently. I don't know what their intentions are. Wu Qilun and I have been friends for more than ten years. He likes to sing operas very much. When I invite actors and actresses to banquets, Wu is in charge of the reception. I usually have Wu Qilun handle all civil and criminal cases for people. Apart from the time he spends in court handling cases, it can be said that he never goes anywhere else. He likes to sit with me in the

Living Room and Talk

My relationship with him is so good that people who live in Shanghai know it perfectly well and have no ill feelings. Why would I commit a crime and incite someone to kill him? There is one more thing I would like to ask the court to do. Summon Wu Qilun's elder brother and his son to court to question them. I paid for Wu Qilun's funeral expenses entirely. If I had killed him, would I still be taking care of these matters? As for my case in the French Concession, Wu Qilun was not my lawyer at all. Whether he put in effort or not has nothing to do with me. As for the case of Qiu Changyin confirming guardianship, it is said that the Qiu family paid me 31,000 yuan in mediation fees, which I did not share with Wu Qilun, causing Wu to damage my reputation outside. This is also

A Joke

I only saw this case in the newspaper. I never participated in the mediation. Where did this huge mediation fee come from? In short, I am now completely wronged by them. I request the court to allow me to propose witnesses who are beneficial to the defendant for questioning so that the truth can be revealed. Even Shen Yufei (a suspect in the bombing of a newspaper office), a prisoner in the same cell as me, said that Qiao Yaoshan was with them for several days. According to Shen, they are completely implicating me out of malice. The court verified the confession and ordered all defendants to be remanded in custody. The hearing was adjourned to the 15th of this month, pending the arrival of the Western Detective Chief for further questioning. Court adjourned at 5:40 PM.

### Qing Yu Li Case - Appeals Rejected

Regarding the houses in Qing Yu Li, Chongqing Road, contracted by the Shanghai Women's Bank, the bank and the Poor Children's Education Institute (the owner of the houses) had a contract requiring the houses to be rebuilt before January 1, 1939. Otherwise, the bank would be subject to a fine of more than 200,000 yuan. Therefore, in July 1938, the bank filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court against all the tenants of the Qing Yu Li, requesting them to vacate the houses. After three trials, the tenants lost the case. During the period of enforcement negotiations, the Women's Bank partially built fences and began demolishing houses. The tenants repeatedly tore down the fences, leading to criminal lawsuits. Later, the tenants suddenly obtained new evidence: a contract between the Women's Bank and the Poor Children's Education Institute to extend the rebuilding period. They hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to file a petition for retrial with the Second Branch of the High Court and applied for a stay of execution. The court ruled to overturn the original three trials, and the tenants, Ping Jin'ya, etc., were granted an extension until December 1940 to return the houses to the Women's Bank. Over 3,000 tenants were able to live in peace. The Women's Bank appealed to the Supreme Court, disagreeing with the ruling. The tenants also filed a cross-appeal. The Supreme Court has now upheld the judgment of the Second Trial, dismissing both appeals. The litigation costs are to be borne by each party.

### Editors of Registered Books, Newspapers, and Magazines Must Submit Photos

The News Agency reports that the Public and Concession Police Department has stipulated that all books, newspapers, and magazines published within the concession that apply for registration with the department must submit two two-inch photos of the editor in addition to filling out the form for verification. Those who have already registered with the department must also submit the editor's photos within days.

### No Clues in the Xie Zhitin Assassination Case

According to the Shanghai Times, the assassination that occurred in front of the Metropole Ballroom on Gordon Road late on the 6th of this month, in which Xie Zhitin, 55 years old, died, remains without clues as to the identity of the assassin as of yesterday (the 7th). It is widely believed that the case was politically motivated. According to Japanese sources, Xie originally worked at the Shanghai branch of Citibank. He later served as a "financial advisor" to the "Reformed Government" in Nanjing and as the chairman of the "Central China Fisheries Company" and a "director of the China Prosperity Bank." On the night of the 6th, Xie was at a banquet in the Broadway Mansions. On his way back to his residence at 72 Dunxin Road, he was shot in a vital area by three or four assailants and killed when he passed the Metropole Ballroom. In addition, it is reported that the victim in the bloodshed that occurred in front of the Metropole Ballroom on Gordon Road on the evening of the 6th of this month was Xie Zhitin, a senior official of the "Consolidated Tax Bureau." Xie's real name was Yonghong, and Zhitin was his courtesy name. The previous report stating Xie's name as Qingmo was incorrect. Xie's body has been examined by a prosecutor dispatched by the Prosecutor's Office of the First Special Court, who confirmed that Xie was assassinated. The body has been ordered to be claimed.

### Social Miscellany

Cao Jinbiao, from Anhui, broke into Wang A'hai's house at 1577 Yangshupu Road on the morning of March 17th this year with a weapon and attempted theft. While fleeing, he stabbed Shi Ruida, Wang's neighbor, who was mortally wounded. Cao was apprehended by Wang A'hai and handed over to the patrol police, who took him to the police station and then to the First Special Court. Presiding Judge Huang Risheng repeatedly held court to investigate the case. The verdict was announced yesterday morning: Cao Jinbiao was sentenced to two years and six months for theft and ten years for murder, to be served concurrently for a total of eleven years and six months. The murder weapon was confiscated.

Li Qiang'gen, the five-year-old son of Li Shuren, a Chongming native residing at 61 Rue du Père Robert, was playing with his nine-year-old sister Laiying on the rooftop of their four-story apartment at 1 PM on the 7th. Qiang'gen suddenly climbed onto the cement railing, lost his balance, and fell to the ground, fracturing his skull. Fresh blood and brain matter splattered everywhere. He was immediately sent to Guangci Hospital, but medical treatment was ineffective, and he died in the evening of the same day.

### Weather Report

The Zikawei Observatory issued the following weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday: Shandong and the surrounding areas will have clear and warm weather with southeast to southwest winds. The area from this station to the south of Ma'an Island will change from overcast to cloudy with fog and northeast to southeast winds. In the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 74.3 degrees and the lowest was 60.3 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest temperature was 76.8 degrees and the lowest was 54.1 degrees.

### Strike at British Xiangtai Timber Mill Leads to Fatalities - Three Workers Killed and Wounded in Brawl

A strike broke out at the British-owned Xiangtai Timber Mill at 1126 East Yangshupu Road at around 9 AM yesterday, resulting in fatalities. Three workers were killed and wounded. The details are as follows:

Strike Resolved

Xiangtai Timber Mill was founded by a British merchant. It is a well-funded enterprise with a long history, employing over 1,500 workers, including over 500 in the sawing section. Recently, due to soaring prices and difficult living conditions, the workers demanded improved treatment from the factory. The labor representatives, led by Li Fengqi (45 years old, from Ningbo), presented conditions to the factory. After several consultations between labor and management representatives, and a compromise on the amount of rice subsidies, a resolution was reached.

A Brawl

However, the labor representatives suspected Li of favoring the management and expressed dissatisfaction. At approximately 9:10 AM yesterday, over 500 workers in the sawing section held differing opinions. Initially, there were only disputes, which then escalated into violence. They wielded iron bars and other weapons, engaging in mutual attacks. The mill's manager immediately reported the incident to the Yangshupu Police Station, which dispatched armed police in patrol cars to suppress the violence and disperse the rioting workers, maintaining order.

Three Killed and Wounded

During the worker brawl, Song Yougen, a coal and firewood contractor from Ningbo, was struck in the buttocks. Worker Wang Linsheng was injured in the head. Labor representative Li Fengqi suffered a severe head injury from an iron bar striking his right temple, and his breathing was faint. An ambulance was summoned to the scene, and the three injured were sent to Hudong Hospital for treatment. Li Fengqi died shortly afterward due to his severe injuries. The police are investigating the cause of the strike and tracking down the perpetrators for prosecution.

### Letter to All Students in Shanghai from the University and Middle School Students' Friendship Association (4)

We must severely condemn those who sell out the nation and state, their acts of treason, and the secret agreements they sign, which are much more detrimental than the usual national traitors and the Twenty-One Demands. "Poverty cannot make one move; force cannot make one yield." Surrender-style peace is treason. We must never submit to their threats and inducements. From today onwards, we must continue the spirit of the May Fourth Movement and express our conviction with resolute actions. On the one hand, we must study diligently; on the other hand, we must always keep in mind that in our struggle against resistance and nation-building, we should firmly believe that the Three Principles of the People are the highest and supreme guiding political path for us, and the program of resistance and nation-building is the only national policy we adhere to. Of course, we will not act rashly, but we will never forget our sacred mission. Under the principle of "studying without forgetting to save the country, saving the country without forgetting to study," we must keep the following points in mind: (1) We must pursue the truth of resistance and nation-building from school life. (2) We must build our bright and brilliant future from the spirit of hard work, self-improvement, and struggle. (3) We demand regular and reasonable activities. (4) We must strengthen our spiritual fortress. (To be continued)

### Public Exhibition Cup Successfully Concludes; China Youth Wins Tenth Championship in a Row; Yan Hua Group Wins Without Effort; Zhu Sun Group Narrowly Loses; Final Week Nine Against Six; Overall Result Two Against One

The tenth Public Exhibition Cup handball tournament successfully concluded last night. In last night's main doubles battle, the Western Youth team, with the overall situation already decided, lacked the ability to turn the tide, and their morale was greatly diminished. The first doubles team of M. Krepling and Jeb Meng actually forfeited, so Hua Fenggang and Yan Peiqiu won without effort. In the first doubles, China Youth's ball king Zhu Kuan and veteran Sun Shisheng cooperated, facing off against Western Youth's alliance leader F. Krepling and Hua Mu. Zhu and Sun were in excellent form, versatile, and full of vigor in both offense and defense. However, Hua, relying purely on strength, was ultimately outmaneuvered by Zhu and Sun, who relied on strategy. However, Zhu and Sun, finding it difficult to compete in strength and because China Youth had already secured victory, did not engage in a fierce battle. The tenth Public Exhibition Cup has now been completely declared over. China Youth has won the championship in a row. With the exception of the first four championships, which were won by the Western Youth team, China Youth has now won six consecutive championships.

Results of last night's games:

Hua Fenggang defeated Krepling (Doubles Two)
Yan Peiqiu defeated Jeb Meng (Forfeit)
F. Krepling (21-18) Zhu Kuan
Hua Mu (21-10) Sun Daosheng

Overall Results:

First Cycle: 12-3 China Youth Wins
Second Cycle: 8-7 Western Youth Wins
Third Cycle: 9-6 China Youth Wins

(Overall Result): 2-1 China Youth Wins

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Gradually Stabilizing

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's posted rates. The black market for British and American exchange rates was stable with a hint of firmness, a very mediocre situation, caused by the uneven transactions of operators and a reduction in speculation. The morning opening also reported that the British rate was flat and the American rate was tight, indeed because exchange rates continued to fall by 0.3625, and the unprecedented low price of 3.375 yuan was seen again. It was also heard that general short sellers were unwilling to cover their positions, so it was said that the future of the American pound was very difficult to predict. Today, buyers and sellers, speculators, and outsiders mutually supplied and demanded, and the price trended toward looseness in a flat market. The lowest price for the May American exchange rate was 4.53125 yuan. Speculators arbitraged, going long on the spot market and selling the current month's contract, gaining 0.125 US dollars. Calculated over 23 days, the interest was around 0.035. Until the closing, the market lacked change. The closing price for the British exchange rate was 3.34375 pence, and the American exchange rate was 4.6875 yuan, both firmer by 0.003125 compared to the previous day's closing. In terms of futures and spot prices, the convergence became more pronounced.

The British and American exchange rates fell again. At the beginning of the morning, the London telegrams showed that both near-term and far-term contracts fell by 0.0625. The New York silver price remained flat. The London gold price remained unchanged. The exchange rates of the British exchange rate against Shanghai, France, and other exchange rates were all flat. The American exchange rate against the British exchange rate continued to fall sharply by 0.3625. It remained unchanged against Shanghai, and fell by 0.00125 against France. The central government's posted rates for various exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were 3.3125 pence for the British exchange rate and 4.625 yuan for the American exchange rate, which were flat for the British exchange rate and tight for the American exchange rate by 0.003125 compared to the previous day's evening closing. This was due to the sharp contraction of the exchange rates again. At the same time, the futures opening showed that the American exchange rate was flat and the British exchange rate was loose. After the opening, Chinese speculators still had an appetite, but the intention to supply by outsiders was not bad, so the market immediately showed a slight firmness. It was calculated that outsiders stuffed five duns (monetary units) of American exchange rate at 4.5 yuan to Chinese speculators. The announcement of the HSBC posted rate remained unchanged. The announcement of the white silver equalization tax showed a reduction of 0.5 yuan. After this, speculators once again appeared with the May American exchange rate price at 4.5625 yuan, while outsiders sold spot American exchange rate to Chinese merchants at 4.6875 yuan. Soon after, Chinese banks such as the Shanghai Bank also entered the market to sell. Outsiders had collected the May American exchange rate as low as 4.53125 yuan. Until noon, the market was still stable. As a result, at the closing, the British exchange rate was 3.34375 pence and the American exchange rate was 4.6875 yuan. This month's British exchange rate was 3.25 pence and the American exchange rate was 4.5 yuan, both looser by 0.003125 compared to the closing price yesterday. This month's British exchange rate was longer by 0.009375 and the American exchange rate was firmer by 0.000625. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

The spot Japanese exchange rate was tighter by 0.5 yuan, to 89 yuan. At 10:10, there was a trend toward firmness. The spot American exchange rate rebounded by 0.000625, to 20.8125 yuan.

The Shanghai exchange rate slightly decreased by 0.25 yuan, to 113.5 yuan. The black market for joint banknotes was up by 1.75 yuan, to 101 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Gradually Rise and Fall

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds hovering and trending downward, so the supply was relatively abundant, and the market prices fell by 3 yuan each. British gold notes also fell by 0.5 yuan due to the loosening of the black market British exchange rate. American gold notes initially began at 21.23 yuan due to the continued decline in the pound price, but then rose to 21.095 yuan due to abundant supply. At noon, it was 21.1 yuan, and in the afternoon it fell back to 21 yuan, a decrease of 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes fell following the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rates. French franc notes were still in demand, and the market price rose slightly. Singapore and Robi Canada notes were all oversupplied, and the market prices uniformly trended weak. Japanese gold notes also trended lower, with the evening price at 1.2775 yuan. Korean notes suddenly had demand, and the market price rose sharply, with the evening price at 1.0005 yuan.

### Discount Rate Down 25 Yuan

Yesterday's discount rate for bills of exchange continued to fall sharply. The rate per 1,000 yuan fell from 170 yuan in the morning to 150 yuan. In the afternoon, it was around 145 yuan, a further decrease of 25 yuan compared to the previous day. The call rate of the Money Industry Association remained unchanged, still quoted at 0.25 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### After Seven Days of Continuous Increases, the Gold Market Began to React Yesterday, Falling Into the 7,000 Yuan Range

Yesterday's black market for cash gold, after seven days of continuous increases, suddenly reported a reaction, but the downward trend was limited. The long operators were still willing to work hard to maintain it. The market situation was extremely ordinary, and transactions did not appear enthusiastic. This was also because the exchange market had stabilized and the environment lacked stimulation. The morning opening reported a small increase of 40 yuan. It was heard that after the silver houses and gold houses supplied, the money changers sold together. Before long, the price broke below the 7,000 yuan mark, and for a time there were many short positions sold. The lowest price seen was 6,950 yuan. Later, a certain silver house and securities firms, seeing cheap prices, absorbed the long positions, and the price rebounded to 7,050 yuan. However, retail investors suddenly made a settlement at a high price, and the price fell again to 6,980 yuan at the closing. Earlier, thanks to the lifting of the gold houses, it had rebounded slightly, but the silver houses and money changers sold off their long positions, so the result was a closing price of 6,960 yuan, a drop of 100 yuan compared to the previous evening's closing. In the afternoon, the off-market situation turned slightly, and buyers were willing to buy in at 10 yuan higher than the afternoon closing price, but there was still a lack of suppliers, so few transactions were heard. The volume of transactions gradually decreased from busy to quiet, at around 1,800 taels. Gold ornaments in silver shops were quoted at a small increase of 10 yuan. Customs gold and other prices remained flat.

Roasted Red Plum Reduced by 100 Yuan

From the morning, although the initial opening exchange rate for each bar (10 taels) fell, the American exchange rate was slightly tighter, and it soon rebounded, so people's hearts could not be agitated. On the contrary, there were many sellers. The opening was immediately pressed down by a small 40 yuan. The silver houses offered 10 taels to the silver shops for 7,020 yuan. It had stabilized slightly, but soon a certain money changer tended to sell off, and a certain gold house also followed suit, while the foreign exchange rate was stable and firm. Although the silver houses and gold houses took the opportunity to absorb, the long positions ultimately felt abundant, and the price immediately fell by 70 yuan. The money changers offered 10 taels to the silver shops, losing to 6,990 yuan. Then, a certain silver house took advantage of the low price to search for purchases, and the sellers had stopped selling and watched, and there was a rebound of tens of yuan. Later, another silver house relied on tracking and pulling, plus securities firms and money changers competed to buy, and continued to see a rebound of tens of yuan. The gold houses bought 10 taels from the silver houses for 7,050 yuan. However, because the foreign exchange rate was still loose, retail investors inevitably took the opportunity to sell off at a high price, and then went downward again. The money changers sold 20 taels to the gold houses for 6,980 yuan. Later, the gold houses came to drag in, and it saw a rebound of 20 yuan again. The gold houses made mutual transactions of 30 taels for 7,000 yuan. At noon, the silver houses and money changers suddenly sold off their long positions, and the price went downstream again. The silver houses bought a total of 20 taels from the silver shops and other firms for 6,960 yuan as the afternoon closing price. As a result, it fell by 100 yuan compared to the previous day. The rise and fall of 100 yuan in half a day showed that the selling price of the gold houses' own brand of gold was a few yuan higher than the roasted red plum price, and the purchase price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current price of standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and few transactions were made.

Gold Ornaments Quoted at a Small Increase of 10 Yuan

The selling price of gold jewelry in silver shops was initially still 720 yuan for Datong Hang, but at 9:40, it was quoted at a small increase of 10 yuan. Since then, there has been no change. It is estimated that Datong Hang changed the quote to 710 yuan, and the new company's price was the same as the above price. The purchase price was reduced by more than 20 yuan.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Suddenly Turn Higher Again – Rubber Stocks Finally Soften

The black market for securities showed an initial decline followed by firmness. There were very few transactions in the morning and more transactions in the afternoon. Market rumors that Song Ziwen was coming to the stage were enough to temporarily stimulate people's hearts, leading to a covering of short positions. The sudden ups and downs of the market were due to the slightly lower price of gold and the looser exchange rate. The volume of transactions in the morning was extremely low. Jianli bought in slightly, and Yichang sold out, and the rest were retail investors trading. In the afternoon, Defu bought in more, and Jiufeng Hongkang sold out, and the market price rose slightly. As a result, it rebounded by 0.01 to 0.03 yuan. The volume of transactions was around 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

In stock transactions, 20 shares of Huacheng Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 45 yuan each.

The stock market's lack of color was probably due to the Champagne Grand Prix. Although it was only a half-day of business, the volume of transactions was not silent. The trend was slightly soft at the opening, and the buyer's appetite was unusually weak. Later, some famous stocks were bought in at low prices, and the price began to turn firm. There was also a large transaction volume of English Union shares, hovering between 71 and 72 yuan. With the exception of the Sihai Insurance share, the rest were generally slightly lower than the previous closing. This share suddenly jumped to a new high price of 19.7 yuan after opening at the low, and retreated to 0.5 yuan at the closing. The Yihua Defeng share also rebounded. The new share rights traded at 85 yuan, the former closed at a base price of 121 yuan, and the latter at 87 yuan.

Rubber stocks have also, in fact, softened. Transactions were not fresh, and although the price drops were limited, all stocks were difficult to escape. To put it bluntly, the selling pressure was not at all sharp, so the acquisition of generally cheap stocks could not be considered an appropriate activity.

London, 7th (Tuesday) Dispatch: Today, the Chinese foreign debt and the stock market prices of various Far Eastern companies in the British trading house have generally stabilized, and there have been no ups or downs in the market.

### Alma Stock Pays Dividends

The interim dividend for the year ending September 1940 for Alma Rubber Tree Co., Ltd., managed by the British Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, is 3 yuan per share in national currency, and is scheduled to be distributed on May 22. The interim dividend for this year is subject to the British Malayan government's implementation of foreign exchange control regulations, which stipulate that dividend distributions are limited to one interim and one final dividend each year. The second interim dividend will no longer be distributed.

### Cotton Yarn: Profits Taken, Yarn Market Slightly Weakened, Shuang Ma (Double Horse) Drops 40 Yuan

The yarn market is trending weaker, and a declining trend has begun slightly. This is because after several days of significant price increases, it has triggered profit-taking, causing the market to loosen, and the reaction is particularly strong. The amount absorbed by general non-industry participants has always been unwilling to give up. Furthermore, the European situation is still tense, and there are concerns that raw materials may become problematic in the future, resulting in smaller imports and a lack of personnel.

The opening momentum of the yarn market this morning was relatively calm because many long positions were closed, and at the same time, actual demand was not strong. Floating long positions were released. 20-count Shuang Ma fell from 1,665 yuan to 1,647 yuan. According to half-day transaction statistics, 1,496 bales were traded. The market price for 20-count Shuang Ma fell by 40 yuan. The factory uniformly offered 1,000 bales of 23-count Golden Rooster at a price of 1,750 yuan, with credit terms of June-July. Today, 112 pieces of yarn were shipped to Xiamen, and another 945 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amounts purchased by various trading groups are detailed as follows:

Hong Kong: 600; Fellow traders: 870;

Inland: 25; Ningbo: 1

Total: 1,496

### Spot Foreign Cotton: 30-40 Yuan Cheaper than Forward Contracts

Cotton trading can still be maintained, but those holding goods, seeing the tense situation in Europe, worry that future ship travel may be obstructed and suspended. Therefore, they are optimistic about the rise in cotton prices. The spot cotton transaction situation is listed on the left.

Da Zhong Ji: 291.00

Da Zhong Ji: 312.00

Da Zhong Ji: 38.00

Fellow traders purchase: 600 pieces

Da Zhong Ji: 310.00

Peng Jia Pu: 307.50, 308.00; Fellow traders purchase: 500 pieces

Bai Luo Qu: 303.00; Fellow traders purchase: 100 pieces

Another report states that the foreign cotton market price in New York was quite weak yesterday due to the selling by spot traders and foreign cotton merchants. The closing price fell by five or six British pounds compared to the previous day. India was closed yesterday, and Egypt fell by more than twenty British pounds.

Foreign cotton trading in Shanghai has been more active in recent days, but it is limited to spot transactions. This is because the selling price of spot goods is not as high as the exchange rate price, and its price has not risen enough. It is 30-40 yuan cheaper than futures contracts. However, due to the extremely tight monetary situation, the transaction volume is not very large. The factory prices converted to US dollars at 4.625 yuan yesterday are as follows:

20-count, American Midling: 375.90

20-count, Lower grade: 360.70

32-count, American Midling: 397.80

32-count, Lower grade: 382.90

42-count, American Midling: 400.50

42-count, Lower grade: 385.60

Indian cotton has also arrived in Shanghai, approximately 5,000 pieces loaded on the British ship "Sudan" from Bombay. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, but there was no news as of 6:00 PM. It is expected to arrive at the port last night or this morning and berth at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading.

### Piece Goods: Cloth Trading Listless, Sales Gradually Improving

The cloth market is experiencing sluggish actual sales and tight monetary conditions. Holders of goods are inclined to sell, so market prices are gradually becoming unsustainable, falling step by step. As a result, fine cloth and fine twill fell by about one yuan per piece, coarse cloth fell by 2.5 to 5 jiao, and coarse twill, which had been low-priced, has recently seen quite active actual sales, so it has been uniquely firm. About 200 bales of coarse twill and coarse cloth, and over 100 bales of fine cloth and fine twill were traded on this street. Several tens of thousands of pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, poplin, linen yarn, and printed cloth were traded. The Guangdong traders handled over one hundred pieces of worsted, poplin, linen yarn, and other goods. The Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Taizhou traders from Zhejiang purchased over one hundred pieces of dark-colored goods such as coarse cloth and flannel. Purchases of light-colored goods are very rare.

Yesterday, Eastern cloth prices fell sharply due to persistently weak actual sales. The lowest price of Longtou fine cloth was 48.5 yuan per piece, and it rebounded slightly at the close to 49.75 yuan. The low price of Four Gentlemen worsted also dropped to 1.425 yuan per yard for spot goods, but after fellow traders collected it, the closing price was 1.455 yuan.

On the 9th, 170 pieces of exported piece goods were shipped to Xiamen, 1,030 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 705 pieces were shipped to Haiphong.

### Food: Arrivals Surge, Sales Slow, Foreign Rice Continues to Decline, Japonica and Glutinous Rice Also See Rebound

The rice market was even more volatile yesterday. Actual demand was stagnant, and speculators lost their support. Moreover, this increase in rice prices was entirely due to speculation. Once the market declined, everyone lost confidence and competed to sell. As a result, the previous mutual agitation turned into individual price reductions. Under these circumstances, prices plummeted all the way. For example, Xiaowen rice fell by half a yuan as soon as the market opened in the morning, to 48.5 yuan, and then fell further to 47.5 yuan. However, as soon as this price appeared, short covering started, and it rebounded to 48 yuan. Later, it fluctuated between 3 and 5 jiao, and finally closed at 47.8 jiao, a further decrease of 1.23 yuan compared to the previous closing price of 49 yuan. However, other goods such as Saigon rice were dragged down by this Xiaowen rice's repeated falls, and although there were varying degrees of fluctuation, the market line gradually became clearer and was no longer as chaotic as before. The quality could also be distinguished more clearly. The closing price of No. 1 Saigon rice was still 50 yuan to 49.5 yuan, No. 2 was 48.5 yuan to 48 yuan, No. 1 Siam was 49.5 yuan to 49 yuan, No. 2 was 48 yuan to 47.5 yuan, Huojiao was 49.3 yuan to 48.7 yuan, and Tokyo sharp rice was 47.5 yuan to 47 yuan. Mixed broken rice and rice tea were still unaffected due to the scarcity of goods and maintained their original prices.

Although the arrival of thick and thin Japonica national rice is still limited, it is rumored that the off-market black market is restricted by foreign rice and it is difficult to gain a foothold. Transactions are few, and selling prices are falling by more than one yuan. Wuxi Qing Special Japonica has entered the 50-yuan range, at 49.5 yuan to 49 yuan. Powdered Japonica is 48.5 yuan to 48 yuan. Changkun Japonica is 48 to 9 yuan. Old rice is 46 to 7 yuan. Qingsi special thin rice is 49 yuan, and the general market is 47 to 8 yuan. Nangang early rice is high at 47.5 yuan, and secondary is 46 yuan.

The market for glutinous rice was originally sluggish, and arrivals were crowded. Most lenders feared encountering a major decline, so they did not hesitate to bear losses and sought to sell quickly, resulting in a sharp drop of more than two yuan in prices. Liyang Special Grade was only sold for 40.05 yuan to 40 yuan, and Changdan City was 38.5 yuan to 38 yuan. Secondary goods such as Chao Rou were only about 47 yuan.

After several days of stabilization, the market for foreign rice has been declining. Speculators gradually lost interest because its market price had little room for maneuver, and those who had profited from retail and small-scale hoarding were eager to sell. Actual sales were sluggish, so the market continued to decline. Yesterday morning, spot foreign rice was more than one yuan cheaper, and in the afternoon it continued to fall by a few jiao to nearly one yuan. Xiaowen rice was more actively traded, and the opening price in the morning was still 48.35 yuan, but in the afternoon market it was as low as 47.35 yuan. At one point in the afternoon, it was as low as 46 yuan, but major players were still unwilling to sell cheaply. The May upper-period No. 2 Saigon also fell from 49.2 yuan to 48.89 yuan, but hoarders were more greedy, and the decline was slower than that of spot rice. A total of 5,000 bags of spot rice and 400 tons of futures were opened for trading throughout the day. According to reports, over 6,700 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Jardine Matheson's Yong Sheng arrived yesterday, carrying 723 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. In addition, the Taikoo Company's Jinan arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday, also carrying 6,039 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. Both ships have been unloaded separately.

### Flour Market Irregular, Over 50,000 Bags Shipped to Xiamen

The flour market turned flat. The trading throughout the day was quite irregular. The local market was sluggish because the factory price had reached 14 yuan and retail sales were not strong, so purchases were weak. Although sales to merchant groups were somewhat gradual, there was no hope of expansion. In addition, the decline in rice prices inevitably relaxed people's minds. The turnover of recycled old car brand flour was poor. Only domestic-made factory flour had some new transactions, with Kaishan Deer brand at 14.2 yuan and Phoenix brand transit goods at 13.9 yuan. The market was very calm and ordinary. The total volume of flour traded throughout the city was about 5,000 to 6,000 bags. There was no market for wheat.

On the 9th, 50,300 bags were exported to Xiamen, and 40,000 bags will be shipped to Tianjin tomorrow.

### Oil Market: Mainly Imported Raw Oil, Some Exports of Raw Peanuts and Beans

Yesterday, 1,844 cans of raw oil arrived from Tianjin, and 1,000 cans arrived from Yantai. On the 9th, 1,535 bags of beans and 1,700 bags were exported to Xiamen, and 1,350 bags of raw peanuts were exported to Hong Kong. 500 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong, and 300 cans were shipped to Xiamen.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Slightly Decline, Imports and Exports Also Significant

Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight loosening trend due to the strength of foreign exchange. The association set the price for 24 coarse white sugar at 76.3 yuan at local warehouses, down a few jiao. New goods at foreign warehouses were 76 yuan, and old goods were 75.8 to 6 jiao, a decrease of 5 or 6 jiao. Transshipment goods for delivery at the end of May were traded at 59.8 yuan, down 2 jiao. Taikoo's Car White B brand at the Western warehouse was 86.5 yuan, down half a yuan. HX brand was 85 yuan, and H brand was actually 63 yuan. Dutch Red at foreign warehouses was 66.5 yuan, and transshipment was 55.5 yuan. Local factory's special white sugar was 76 yuan, down 5 jiao. Local rock sugar was 90 yuan, and Jingming rock sugar was 92 yuan, both unchanged. Yesterday, 610 bags of Diaozhen, 200 bags of Car White, 425 bags of white sugar from Guangxi Bay, and 1,114 bags of red and white sugar from Haikou arrived on the Jinan. 125 bags of sliced sugar also arrived. On the 9th, 150 bags of sugar were shipped to Xiamen, and 3,000 bags will be shipped to Qingdao on the 10th.

### Woolen Cloth: White Serge in Short Supply

White serge is quite scarce. Local textiles cannot be compared. Extremely rare products are not sufficient to supply and the market price suddenly jumped. Yesterday, 222 brand white serge was sold for 35 yuan for a batch of spot deliveries. Tihe was 28 yuan, and Donghuo's top grade was sold for 23 to 4 yuan, while ordinary was around 20 yuan. Most of the local factory goods from local factories such as Yihe, Hongkang, and Yongxing are selling for 17 to 8 yuan. Western clothing merchants have a large amount of orders due to summer needs.

### Hardware: Local Factory Nails Reach the 80 Yuan Mark

The local factory nail market has flourished with the tightening of foreign exchange. However, its outlets, such as local construction merchants and Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao merchants, are all experiencing sluggish sales, resulting in a sluggish market. The market stabilized when foreign exchange prices stabilized before yesterday. The price of local factory nails was no exception, so the various sales outlets in the local market saw a slight movement, but their price was already close to the 80 yuan mark, an increase of about 20 yuan compared to the previous sharp increase.

### Silk and Tea: Silk Prices Remain Firm, Artificial Silk Continues to Arrive in Shanghai

The American silk market fluctuated slightly yesterday. New York's near-term increased by 3 points, and the long-term decreased by 4 points. Yokohama spot goods increased by 10 yuan, and the long-term decreased by a small amount of 11 yuan. Silk deliveries at foreign firms were quite active yesterday. Libo Baixue brand was sold for 3,000 yuan, and 50 piculs of Libo Zhenfu brand were traded in total. Baitou Foreign Firm Qianjin Silk opened for trading with 20 piculs, at a price of 2,000 yuan. Silk prices are in a firm stabilization process.

Regarding artificial silk, most Eastern goods are recently coming to Shanghai from Hong Kong to fill up foreign goods. Yesterday, 266 bags arrived from Hong Kong on the Yong Sheng. It is also rumored that 1,000 bags of Italian-made artificial silk will arrive in Shanghai today on the Italian postal ship Cantrolegno. It is expected to be imported at around 3 PM today and will berth at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading.

New tea continues to be traded. The city collectively purchased over seventy boxes of Zhenmei green tea through Jinlong Tongfu and other firms. The selling price of Chouzhen was 575 yuan, and the selling price of Tongzhen was 46-7 yuan. The selling price did not fluctuate much. Currently, Chinese merchants have stopped purchasing because the price of inland raw tea is expensive. Yesterday, 3,354 pieces of tea leaves came from Hong Kong. Today, 124 pieces will be shipped to Xiamen, and 240 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Wuxi Mulberry Leaves Soar—Spring Silkworms Have Reached the Second Molt

This year's spring silkworms in Wuxi's rural areas are the most prosperous on record. The weather has been warm and mild in recent days, development has been rapid, and progress has been good. They have now reached the second molt. However, the demand for mulberry leaves exceeds the supply. The price has risen from 20 yuan for 3 dan to 40 yuan for 3 dan because all goods are increasing in price, and everyone is universally optimistic. (Liang)

### April Raw Silk Exports to the United States Decrease; Market Remains Firm

The import and sales of raw silk in New York in April did not differ much from the previous month. Imports decreased by 1,285 bales, sales increased by 55 piculs, and inventory decreased by 3,189 piculs. Therefore, the silk market at the beginning of the month showed a firm and stable trend. The following is an excerpt of the statistics:

It is expected that New York's raw silk imports will decrease even further this month. Currently, the raw silk on the way to the United States totals 11,000 piculs, which is 2,200 piculs less than the previous month and 14,800 piculs less than the same month last year, a decrease of over 50%.

Old News Re-Copied: 67 Years Ago (377)

(See this newspaper from the 12th year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty)

### Welcoming Spring Rituals (3)

Among the ceremonial guards, there were over thirty pairs of "Virtuous Governance" plaques and seventeen "Ten Thousand People" umbrellas, embroidered with gold thread on red silk, dazzling and magnificent. They appeared like colorful clouds and mist, forming a canopy descending from the sky. This was because the esteemed magistrate was serious in his duties, and the people of Hangzhou were grateful for his virtue, so each village and neighborhood continuously and publicly contributed these items. Additionally, green banners carrying messages, golden gongs shaking the sky, all types of flags, arrows, spears, clubs, door spears, sitting flags, and battle gear were seen passing in teams of over forty people. Dozens of jailers, each in black clothing and black hats, with goose feathers inserted in their hair, either carrying leather whips on their shoulders or holding iron chains in their hands. There were also large bamboo segment boards and colorfully painted military clubs, all dragged along the ground. Handcuffs, chest clubs, and shackles sounded like chains, the noise of which was terrifying to hear. At this time, no less than a thousand people watched along the roadside, all silently observing without speaking. After the two county magistrates passed, the prefectural governor's procession connected along the road. Because the prefectural governor's position was more senior, the retinue was even more elaborate. The guiding attendants and the "Benevolent Governance" plaques and "Ten Thousand People" umbrellas were roughly the same, but the door spears, tokens, arrows, drawing tubes, punishment rods, and musicians and drummers, horn blowers, etc., all rode on horseback, unlike the county magistrates who walked. In between were dozens of personal soldiers, their uniforms bright and their weapons sharp, which was especially imposing. Behind them were horsemen like clouds, riding together, who were the clerks from the governor's office. The esteemed governor sat upright in his sedan chair, his demeanor dignified, and his appearance was vastly different from the two county magistrates.

Science

### The Advantages and Disadvantages of Science

— Frugality

Mr. Genier, a lecturer at the University of Toulouse in France, recently wrote a book called "Machinery and Philosophy." In the book, he commented in detail on the progress of industry. Now, I will selectively introduce the main points of his book to readers.

There are about two reasons why there were no complex machines in ancient times:

(1) Science was still in its infancy in all aspects, so the ancients could not apply the principles of science to industry.

(2) The ancient economic system was based on the slave system. Modern British writer Huxley also said: "The economic system of ancient Greece was based on the slave system, so there was no need to use scientific principles to improve industry at that time."

The author writes: "It is the mistake of the ancients that the various philosophical problems have not been solved for centuries, while industry has advanced rapidly and completely changed the whole world. We should use the latest invented theories to find other truths, in order to improve the living conditions of human beings; or create a science to reduce human work."

However, the development of modern industry has caused another mistake. Around 1790, mechanization in England rapidly became widespread throughout the country. Workers were hit hard, most of them lost their jobs miserably, and fell into hunger and cold. By 1815, the main reason for unemployment among the working class was that too many goods were produced and there was nowhere to sell them. The reason for this is not the result of machines being too sophisticated, but the result of an uneven distribution of production... Workers sew many shirts every day, and these shirts are displayed in factories. Although they are piled up like mountains, they are of no benefit to the workers themselves. They are naked, which is ridiculous?

So our mistake is that we don't know how to manage the production of sophisticated industries and how to distribute the produced goods. As for the suffering of workers' unemployment, it has nothing to do with the development and improvement of industry itself.

However, we must clearly distinguish between science and industry. Science is only a kind of thought. Once it is applied to practice, it is no longer science. Therefore, many people blame the cruelty of war on the progress of science, which is a misunderstanding. Because science itself has no so-called good or evil, only the application of science can seek happiness for mankind or become a tool for killing people. Therefore, airplanes can carry patients or bombs. The itself has no good or evil. Whether it is beneficial or harmful depends on how it is used.

Therefore, the advantages and disadvantages of science are artificial. This is a question of usage, and to put it further, it can be said to be a question of system.

Reflections

### Little Cricket

— Gongxi Cao

After watching the colorful cartoon "Pinocchio," the little cricket in the film has been jumping up and down in my heart, jumping so much that I can't help but say a few words.

Little Cricket is Pinocchio's conscience. He wants to make him brave, honest, and unselfish: to help him become a real boy.

The fox and the cat lured Pinocchio to the evil road. The first time they used reputation as a bait to sell him to the owner of the puppet show, but Little Cricket made him repent and be saved. The second time, they touched his heart with the happy life on Pleasure Island, and after running to have a good time, he grew a pair of donkey ears and a donkey tail. If it weren't for Little Cricket taking him out of the tiger's mouth, who knows what fate would have followed?

Pinocchio went home and couldn't find his father. The love for his father made him unafraid of all the difficulties. Little Cricket accompanied him to the belly of the whale in the sea, where he found his father. Later, in order to save his father, the puppet Pinocchio died, but in front of his father's tears, another Pinocchio appeared—a real boy.

Little Cricket fulfilled his duty of conscience, so the Blue Fairy gave him a gold badge.

This is of course a fairy tale, but it unintentionally strikes some people in China today.

A person's conscience, of course, cannot exist independently outside the body; however, a person's conscience may very well run out of the body and fly away without a trace. At that time, "temptation" is using its great power.

Today, China has some Pinocchios who are puppets, working hard for their masters, completely disregarding the fate of being locked in a cage when they go back at night; today, there are also some people in China who are dreaming of Pleasure Island, forgetting the old father who is about to be swallowed by a whale, completely disregarding whether they will still have the freedom to be a human being after "happiness."

These are all unscrupulous people. Their Little Crickets have already disappeared. I don't know when they will fly back?

I hope that "Pinocchio" can also have the opportunity to see "Pinocchio" while acting and dreaming of happiness. ——Fairy tales are fairy tales, but adults can also see some things. Because even if one is an adult, without a conscience, one cannot be a human being.

### Why Should the World Games Be Stopped?

### Seize the Moment

— Translated by Liu Jiagan from the original by Franklin

If time is the most precious of all things, then wasting time must be a huge waste, because lost time will never return; we often say that we have plenty of time, but the fact proves that there is never enough time.

Let us rise up and do things purposefully: through our diligence, we will have no difficulty in doing more things.

Laziness makes everything difficult, unless he is diligent, then everything can be turned from difficult to easy.

A person who gets up late must be busy all day long and still find it difficult to complete his tasks in the evening; poverty will immediately seize a lazy person.

Do your business, don't let business push you; get up early and go to bed early to become a healthy, wealthy and wise person.

Education

### Bertrand Russell and Sexual Morality

— Wen He

The May 7th issue of this newspaper’s education news section carried an article entitled “Huge Uproar in American Educational and Youth Circles,” which readers must have seen. It discussed the matter of “Russell being ruled by the court as not being allowed to teach at New York College.” Regarding this matter, there were many details about the causes and consequences that were not mentioned in that day's newspaper, and this is to provide some supplementary information.

The person who stirred up this "huge uproar" was Bishop Manning of New York. Because Russell was going to teach at the State University of New York, Manning published an open letter in various newspapers, attacking Russell. The most severe point in the letter was regarding Russell's "adultery." This is because Russell had divorced three times. His first wife, Alys Pearsall, divorced him in 1921 on the grounds that Russell had an affair with another woman named Dora Winfred Black, who was about to give birth at the time. After the divorce, Dora became Russell's official wife. In 1933, she announced that she had given birth to a child with journalist Griffin Barry. At the same time, Russell seemed to be having affairs, and Dora instead accused him of adultery and divorced him in 1935. In 1936, when Russell was already in his sixties, he remarried his former female secretary, Patricia Helen Spence, and is still married to her. Russell had published opinions on adultery, believing that it was not worth making a fuss about, so Bishop Manning seized on this and severely reprimanded him.

Immediately, the Hearst newspapers responded to Bishop Manning, listing Russell's four major sins: (1) anti-religious; (2) immoral; (3) radical; and (4) heathen. With these four major sins, he was deemed unfit to teach in New York. Other church groups such as Catholics, Lutherans, and Baptists also rose up to denounce Russell.

On the other hand, prominent American professors and many university presidents stood up to defend Russell. M.R. Cohen, a philosophy professor at the City College of New York, said: "In all the universities where Russell has taught, no parent, faculty member, or school authority has ever said that Russell has had any immoral influence." This statement was strongly supported by students. N.P. Mead, the acting president of the City College, also said: "We are inviting him to teach philosophy and logic… not to discuss his personal moral views."

The New York City Council and the Board of Higher Education also held meetings one after another to discuss the matter. Finally, Mrs. Jean Kay, as a taxpayer, petitioned the court to terminate Russell's contract, because her daughter was about to enter New York College, and she did not want to see her daughter being negatively influenced by Russell, so she filed the lawsuit. Her lawyer brought four books written by Russell: "What I Believe," "Marriage and Morals," "Education and the Good Life," and "Education and the Modern World." In these four books, Russell advocated free sex and abandoning the constraints of marriage. Such ideas are of course quite dangerous to modern society, so the court, in order to respect public opinion, accepted her request and did not allow Russell to lecture at the City College of New York.

After learning of the verdict, Mrs. Kay said: "Justice and integrity have triumphed, and I am very happy. In this great struggle, I am a symbol… I believe that the mothers of the world all have their own philosophy, which is not only comparable to that of great philosophers, but also surpasses them in many ways."

Russell, who is still teaching at the University of California, was greatly surprised when he learned of this. He said: "This is a big blow to me. I don't know what to say. I want everyone to know: I didn't want that position… I am not like Bishop Manning. I am not as interested in sexual issues as he is."

Arts and Entertainment

### Recent Situation of the Performing Arts Scene in the Temporary Capital

— Xiao Qi

The entertainment industry in the temporary capital, Chongqing, is now experiencing unprecedented activity, with a total of four luxurious cinemas, two Sichuan opera theaters, one Chu opera theater, two Peking opera theaters, one Dagushu (large drum storytelling) theater, and one Shandong opera theater.

The cinemas often screen softcore films like "The Secret History of the Louvre" and "Baibao Tu" (Map of a Hundred Treasures). The screening of "Mulan Joins the Army" gave the audience a big shock, which resulted in a surge of anger and a "film burning" incident, causing a major disturbance in the Chongqing film industry. In order to meet the urgent needs of this market, the China Film Studio has recently been working hard to produce films such as "Frontier Storm," "Japanese Spy," "Hometown of White Clouds," and "Light of East Asia." The writer Feng Hezi (Feng Zi) plays the main role in "Hometown of White Clouds"; other first-class artists such as Shu Xiuwen, Bai Yang, and Gao Zhanfei are all very active.

As a result of the efforts of cultural figures, various drama troupes have sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain, and there are quite a few remarkable successful scripts. For example, "Miss Jin," written and directed by Ling He, "Yue Fei" and "Metamorphosis" (written and directed by Cao Yu) of the National Drama School, "National Air Defense" (co-written by Lao She and Song Zhide, directed by Ma Yanxiang) of the China Wansui Drama Troupe, and "Shanghai Nights" (written and directed by Hong Shen, Ma Yanxiang, etc.) of the Fudan Drama Society have all achieved good results. Recently, because Zhang Min, He Mengfu, Sha Meng and other people have successively arrived in Chongqing, "Amateur" has the possibility of revival; Song Zhide's new script "Fog-laden Chongqing" for "Amateur" will soon be officially staged. With the convergence of talents, the drama movement in Chongqing can be said to be in a white-hot state.

Because popular literary writer Lao Xiang has joined forces with the performing arts community, the writers write and they take it to the stage to sing. From comedic Dagushu to Shandong Dagushu and crosstalk, there are often new topical and timely singing pieces to be heard, which penetrate deeply into the people and have the greatest impact. Sichuan opera and Chu opera, due to the limitations of dialect, are only popular with native Sichuanese who love these local operas with local flavor. People from other provinces rarely go to see them, except for the occasional fun. Even Peking opera, because of the long distance and the excessive cost, has never had any red-hot performers from Beijing and Shanghai showing their faces, which cannot but be said to be a regret!

### Louise Rainer Talks About the Secrets of Acting

—

"Please tell us some secrets of acting, Miss Rainer!" someone asked Louise Rainer, who had won the Academy Award twice.

She said: "I'm sorry, I don't have any secrets of acting, but I think actors must constantly 'learn.' Before I came to Hollywood, I had never learned English, but now I can speak it fluently. This can be said to be the result of hard work! From this point of view, as long as you study diligently, you will eventually succeed. That can be considered the secret of acting!"

She also said: "I never easily let go of the things I see and hear every day. I carefully study them, imitate them, and then perform what I have learned on the screen. Some people think I have extraordinary wisdom, but they don't know that I got it from 'learning'."

That person asked again: "Miss, what are your thoughts on winning the award twice?"

She replied: "I am certainly happy to win the award, but I dare not be complacent. I think the Academy Award is an indication that the actor has had some success, and its value is equal to a 'milestone'. In other words: 'Even if you are successful in playing a certain role, you still have to work hard to move forward. It definitely doesn't mean that after you win the Academy Award, your acting skills have reached their limit'."

Louise Rainer's acting skills have indeed reached a miraculous state, but she is still humble and modest. I hope the actors of domestic films will strive to learn her spirit of "learning"!

### Gorky Films are Popular in the Soviet Union

(Tash Agency, Moscow) The Soviet cinemas are now showing the film "My Universities." The film tells the story of the great writer Gorky's arduous struggle in his youth. After Gorky arrived in Kazan, he originally planned to study, but because he was penniless, he could not achieve his goal. Gorky then set up a temporary "university" in a riverside bakery, studying diligently. The whole film depicts Gorky's darkest period of life, suggesting that young people should fight in such harsh environments.

### Interesting Facts About Entertaining the Performing Arts Community

— Sun Choucheng

Wu Yunzhai and Wen Lanting, directors of the Shanghai Poor Children's Relief Association, are scheduled to hold a radio broadcast propaganda fundraising conference today (9th). Yesterday, they specially invited the entire Shanghai performing arts community to the Atlantic Western Restaurant to discuss the arrangements. Dozens of Pinghua (storytelling), Tanci (storytelling with stringed instruments), Shanghai opera, and comedy performers such as Fei Zhaolin, Zhao Jiaqiu, Zhu Xiaoxin, Bao Lele, Sheng Daidai, and Hou Wenbin attended. Wen Lanting chaired the meeting, and Li Wenjie and Fang Jiaobo reported that the association currently has 20 voluntary schools, divided into 60 classes, providing relief to 1,500 students. They now plan to add 50 voluntary schools to expand the number of relief students to 5,000, and funds are urgently needed, so they scheduled a radio broadcast on the 9th, asking the entire Shanghai performing arts community to assist... After the report, Gui Yanfang and Hu Guigeng were invited to speak. Later, someone suggested that Jiang Xiaoxiao and Liu Chunshan give an opening speech. So Jiang stood up and said that today they are inviting us to eat, because they want us to sing on the 9th. Now the colleagues are eating very well, and when broadcasting on the radio on the 9th, we should also be so energetic. Liu Chunshan said that we are doing mouth work today and on the 9th, but today is import and the 9th is export, and everyone laughed. Then Liu Ziyun and Huang Feilin were invited to speak. Liu said that the funds for the orphanage depend entirely on the radio broadcast. When it was first established, there were only 24 people, and now there are more than 500. It can be seen that those who make a living by talking contribute their efforts, and the audience pays for it, each doing their best. When Huang delivered his speech, he was righteous and impassioned, which was very moving. A gentleman sitting next to him said: Today's lunch is very enjoyable. People spend money to call a Tanghui (private performance), but I am afraid it is not as grand as today's gathering.
