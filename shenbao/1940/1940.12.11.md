### China Rushes to Draft Spending Plan, Orders Large Quantities of War Materiel from the US, Including Aircraft for Counteroffensive; British Government Announces Loan of £10 Million to China; US Asiatic Fleet Expanding

Washington: It is reported that China is currently rushing to draft a plan for using the new US loan of $100 million. Reuters has learned that China has submitted a list of its needs in war materiel to the US Treasury and other officials, requesting that they consider China's needs when prioritizing various matters. This US decision to grant a large loan to China is the result of the successive efforts of Chinese special envoy Song Ziwen and Ambassador to the US Hu Shi. Ambassador Hu, who is very popular with the Americans, laid the initial groundwork, and Special Envoy Song, with his expert technical assistance, continued the effort for several weeks. The US loan to China was announced suddenly, contrary to the expectations of the Chinese in this area. This must be attributed to Japan, as Japan's recognition of the Nanjing regime helped to expedite the loan's approval. Currently, the Chinese Embassy, members of Special Envoy Song's delegation, and General Mao Bangchu, a key figure in the Chinese Air Force, are very busy working out the detailed procedures for ordering war materiel, so that China can continue its resistance against Japan. China has not yet explained how it will use the US loan, but American sources here say that China plans to purchase a large number of fighter planes to protect the滇緬 Highway, defend Chongqing and other places from air raids, and acquire a large number of bombers for a counteroffensive. China now has a sufficient supply of small arms and ammunition, so it can focus on the purchase of aircraft. China has recently ordered a significant amount of war materiel from manufacturers and will soon increase its purchases in large quantities based on the new loan. (Reuters, 10th)

London: According to official announcements, the British government has agreed to lend China £10 million. This amount is equivalent to $50 million in cash from the recent US loan to China, but the US has also promised to lend China another $50 million for future use. (Reuters, 10th)

Washington: Naval military experts stated yesterday that if US naval policy must follow US foreign policy, then the US fleet must obtain a base of operations in the Far East. Although authorities have denied that the Asiatic Fleet is currently being significantly expanded and prepared for large-scale operations, the following two facts have become open secrets: (1) Supplies in the Far East are being rapidly increased. (2) Land and air forces in the Philippines are being significantly strengthened. Naval experts also believe that if the United States can establish a strong naval force in the South Pacific, it would be very beneficial in alerting Japan. Yosuke Matsuoka's statement yesterday, in which he said that if the US and Japan could each pay attention to their own affairs, relations between the two countries could improve, has aroused dissatisfaction among circles here. However, Matsuoka's general remarks are considered to be moderate. Some people in the State Department believe that there has not been sufficient effort to improve US-Japan relations, and observers believe that there is little hope of a rupture in Japan's relationship with the Axis powers, nor is Japan likely to change its policy toward China or withdraw its troops from China. Japan's changing its policy toward China is the United States' main demand. Several parties have expressed concern about Yosuke Matsuoka's announcement that Japan has no territorial ambitions.

### US Takes Firm Stance on Pacific Issues, Not Softened by Matsuoka's Slightly Moderate Remarks, Japanese Newspapers Continue to Attack the US

Washington: Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka's remarks in Tokyo yesterday regarding Japan's obligation to assist Germany in the war against the United States have effectively dispelled the rumors spread by Japanese people within China and the United States that there will be no conflict between the US and Japan. Sources here believe that Matsuoka's remarks have neither alleviated the difficult task that the new Japanese Ambassador to the US, Nomura, will face upon his arrival in the US, nor have they softened the firm stance taken by the US on the Pacific issues created by Japan. (Reuters, 10th)

Washington: Observers here believe that Matsuoka's conversation yesterday was the first clear statement of Japan's obligations to the Tripartite Pact, leaving much room for flexibility. Government spokespersons here declined to comment on the matter, while researchers stated that if the United States initiates the war first, Japan will automatically and newly consider fulfilling its promises to the Axis powers. This is the significance clearly expressed in Matsuoka's conversation. According to Matsuoka, if the United States is attacked by another country first, then Japan has no need to participate in the war. However, if the United States starts the war first and declares war on one of the three Axis powers, then Japan should assist its allies. Japan should have the right to weigh and decide whether the United States' participation in the war is a reason for Japan to participate in the war. This view has aroused optimism among people in Washington, and Matsuoka's statement that Japan's wishes for the Dutch East Indies are all peaceful in nature is sufficient to make people here optimistic. Previously, outsiders considered the Tripartite Pact to be very strict, but now it is not entirely so. However, Matsuoka's conversation should not be considered as Japan gradually distancing itself from the Axis countries. (United Press, 10th)

Tokyo: Although Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka issued a declaration yesterday filled with hope for US-Japan relations, the "Kokumin Shimbun" continues to attack the US. The newspaper asks if the US will really go to war with Japan over the Dutch East Indies, stating, "If the US becomes more and more excessive and adopts its current attitude, then Japan will no longer tolerate it and will take action." The "Chugai Daily" says that British and American aid to Chongqing is simply intended to exhaust Japan's resources before launching a fierce attack on Japan. (United Press, 10th)

### US Government Adds Armaments Factories, Will Request Additional Funding from Congress

Washington: The Senate and House of Representatives previously decided to allocate $800 million for the establishment of twenty armaments factories. It is expected that the government will submit a bill when the two houses reconvene next year, requesting an allocation of $400 million as supplementary funding for the construction of these factories. The main purpose of the government's addition of these factories is to accelerate the manufacture of various bombs, shells, tanks, and aircraft, so as to provide equipment for a standing army of four million men. As far as the various measures already taken are concerned, they are sufficient to supply one million two hundred thousand men with the necessary firearms and two million men with the necessary clothing.

### US Assistance to Britain on Financial Matters: No Decision Yet

Washington: According to news from here last night, the US is still undecided on the issue of financial assistance to Britain. (Reuters, 10th)

Washington: British Treasury official Phillips arrived in the US a few days ago with a special mission to discuss financial arrangements with the US government.

(Reuters, 10th)

New York: The "New York Evening Post" correspondent in Washington claims that the suggestion that the US should lend a large sum of money to the Netherlands, and then the Netherlands should lend this money to Britain, has attracted the attention of those who are engaged in studying the issue of providing financial assistance to Britain, because this method would avoid any violation of the Johnson Neutrality Act. (Reuters, 10th)

### US Military Attaché to Britain Ordered to Return Home for Consultation

New York: The US military attaché in London has been ordered to return home for consultation. It is believed that the information and opinions he provides will be of great value in determining the extent of US aid to Britain. (Reuters, 10th)

Editorial

### The Turmoil in Southeast Asia

In the mid-19th century, Burma and Vietnam were successively annexed by Britain and France. The tide of imperialism surged, and Thailand (then known as Siam) was still able to maintain its independence, not because of its own strength, but because Britain and France maintained a balance of power. In the 20th century, Japan first defeated Russia in 1905, laying the foundation for its imperialism; then it encountered the First European War, which gave it another excellent opportunity; thus, it formally competed in the ranks of world imperialism, and it took Thailand as its target in Southeast Asia. For this reason, it also promoted the hand-in-hand cooperation between Britain and France in this regard; and Thailand also obtained room for maneuver, and significantly improved its international weight. In addition, it has made proper use of its position for many years, so on the one hand, it can obtain economic and political support from Britain and France; on the other hand, it can also get technical and military assistance from Japan, and slowly enrich its foundation, and complete its independent country that matches its name and reality; and in 1936, the unequal treaties were abolished, and judicial and financial independence was achieved. Furthermore, it encountered the Sino-Japanese War that started in 1937, and two years later, the outbreak of the European War in 1939. The foundations of all international situations were shaken, and old problems were successively being cleared, and Thailand actually revealed its head. Looking at the international situation in Southeast Asia, it is by no means the same as it was four years ago. The most obvious and significant changes include: (1) The French Empire began to collapse, and its power to control its colonies was greatly reduced: (2) Japan exerted its ambition, and the so-called "southward advance" reached the point where the arrow was on the string: (3) Britain, for the survival of the empire, reached a tacit understanding with the United States, and jointly defended Singapore and various parts of Nanyang: (4) The new China appeared magnificently in the international arena with its potential and justice.

In the midst of such a change in the situation in Southeast Asia, Thailand has reached a very dangerous and delicate situation through agitation. For its sake, it seems that it should strive to stabilize the situation in this area; or listen to the natural development of the situation, and remain silent and prudent. However, this is not the case, it also engaged in looting while the fire was burning, emulating imperialism to expand outward, and took the opportunity to make demands on Vietnam to cede territory. The results of this are unknowable, but at least it has increased the turbulence and unrest of the international situation, and at the same time, it has increased its own dangerous opportunities! In this way, the already very complex situation in Southeast Asia has become the fifth factor of turbulence due to Thailand's outward expansion.

Among these five factors, looking forward to future development, the most noteworthy at present are Thailand's expansion and Japan's southward advance.

Three months ago, Thailand has made demands on French Vietnam to cede territory, and armed conflicts on the Thai-Vietnamese border have also occurred successively. Although both sides have been expressing their hope for a peaceful solution since before, judging from the situation, the Thai authorities, who advocate outward expansion and attempt to consolidate their internal military dictatorship, have now become extreme, and there is absolutely no sign of automatically withdrawing their demands and admitting failure. However, standing on the side of the French Vietnamese authorities, fearing the strong and despising the weak, in order to maintain the prestige that has been shaken due to the failure of the European War and the surrender to Japan, there is absolutely no intention to show submission to Thailand again at this time. If they force each other like this, it cannot be said that only war can resolve the dispute, but there are two difficulties in finding a compromise path to achieve a compromise: one is that it is difficult for both parties to find a compromise, and the other is that there is no international pressure that can be used outside of both parties for the time being. Britain and the United States are fundamentally unwilling to participate in this turmoil at this time, let alone after mediating the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, Thailand will suddenly transform itself and become the vanguard of Japan's southward advance. As for Japan, it is using the tension between Thailand and Vietnam in order to force French Vietnam to continue to submit to itself. Both sides refuse to give in and refuse to compromise. How will the future evolve? This is something that deserves great attention! If it develops into a war, Japan will definitely seize an appropriate opportunity to suddenly occupy the entire Vietnam, and then attempt to control Thailand; in the British and American aspects, in order to prevent a serious threat from coming, they will probably have to act first at a certain appropriate time. After Southeast Asia is ignited, it will inevitably affect the overall situation of the world.

### Chinese Troops in Northern Hunan Charge into Yunxi Station, Burn Japanese Warehouses, Inflict Heavy Damage; Chinese Troops in Southern Anhui Also Capture Strongholds

Fancheng: In recent days, Chinese troops have attacked Japanese troops near Fuchiapo, near Yanglousi, killing many Japanese troops and capturing a large number of military supplies and weapons.

Somewhere in Northern Hubei: Commander Li personally went to the front line to inspect during this decisive battle, and returned here on the 6th, telling reporters that the Japanese launched an offensive with more than four divisions in central and northern Hubei, with a very fierce momentum. When they broadcast and promoted their announcement, it was the beginning of their defeat. It was indeed a big joke. Moreover, the defeat of the Japanese army this time, in terms of time, was only within a week, and in terms of space, it was still within the first line. The reason why China was able to achieve victory was entirely due to the guiding principles of revolutionary new tactics for combat. When the Japanese advanced, all frontline units adopted absolute mobile warfare, which is one of the revolutionary new tactics. Commander Li praised the spirit of the frontline Chinese soldiers for fighting bravely and disregarding sacrifice. (9th)

Tunxi: The Japanese troops in the Tianchang and Luhe areas have been engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese troops in recent days. Three Japanese officers, including Captain Sada Shirozawa Rihota, and more than 400 Japanese soldiers were killed by the Chinese in that area. (9th)

### Thai-Vietnamese War Escalates: Thailand Claims French Forces Launch Fierce Attack, Air Battle Ensues

Hanoi: As the Thai-Vietnamese conflict intensifies, with frequent bombings and artillery fire on both sides, the border situation has worsened today. Yesterday, Thai and Vietnamese aircraft engaged in fierce combat, resulting in one Thai aircraft damaged and another destroyed. French forces heavily bombarded Oudong. According to a government bulletin, Thai forces used heavy artillery to bombard Salak on the Mekong River bank at 5:00 AM this morning, firing 35 shells, with no casualties. Three Thai bombers and one fighter plane dropped four bombs on Vientiane, the capital of Laos, at 7:30 AM this morning, and strafed the area with machine guns for half an hour, killing one indigenous soldier and causing some material damage. One Thai aircraft was shot down by French anti-aircraft fire. The French are determined to retaliate for this attack, possibly tonight. The bulletin further stated that Thai aircraft bombed the two water control stations of Ha Van Lak yesterday, one at 10:30 AM and the other at 1:30 PM. (United Press dispatch, 10th)

Bangkok: The Thai Supreme Command recently announced that Vietnamese French forces launched a fierce attack on Thailand yesterday, using aircraft to bomb and strafe the border outposts. French aircraft also bombed Lakon Phanom yesterday, but no casualties were reported. French forces fired hundreds of artillery shells from Savannakhet at Makahan, destroying some indigenous houses. Thai aircraft then attacked the French artillery positions. At 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, ten bombs fell on Lakon Phanom, two of which landed near Thai government buildings. At the same time, French forces fired machine guns at Lakon Phanom from Thaek. At 6:10 AM this morning, two Thai aircraft and three French aircraft engaged in combat over Lakon Phanom, resulting in one French aircraft being shot down and one Thai aircraft damaged. At 7:30 AM this morning, two French aircraft again strafed Thai government buildings there with machine guns before being driven off by Thai aircraft. Thai and French troops are now engaged in heavy rifle and machine-gun fire across the river near two villages near Monkay (transliterated) on the Mekong River bank. French forces fired on a car carrying some local officials, but the bulletin did not report whether there were any casualties. The local police department has issued air raid defense instructions to the public. (United Press dispatch, 10th)

Hanoi: Official sources issued a bulletin today describing the repeated attacks by Thai troops on the Lao town of Vieng-Khan (Note: Vieng-Khan is the seat of the French Resident Commissioner in Laos.) The bulletin stated, "On the morning of the 8th of this month, Thai troops, without provocation, suddenly fired rifles and automatic rifles at ships docked at a pier in Vieng-Khan. French troops immediately returned fire. Thai soldiers ceased firing at 10:00 AM. There were no French casualties and only minor material losses. At 3:00 PM, a Thai aircraft flew over Vieng-Khan, and the city immediately issued an air raid alert. At around 5:00 PM, two Thai light bombers, escorted by one fighter aircraft, dropped about ten bombs on the city, injuring one civilian, damaging two thatched huts, and setting fire to a brick house. Although Thailand has deliberately provoked and committed acts of aggression against Vietnamese territory repeatedly in the past three months, the French authorities have remained calm and are always prepared to negotiate with them according to the conditions and foundations previously presented to the Thai government. However, as the violent actions of that country have occurred repeatedly, the French authorities can no longer tolerate them. Therefore, after the Vieng-Khan incident, the garrison was instructed to take retaliatory measures. Our aircraft, based on this order, flew to the Thai city of Nakhon Phanom (across from Tha Khaek) at dawn today and dropped twelve bombs." (Havas dispatch, 9th)

Tokyo: Japanese sources in Hanoi report that Thai troops opposite the Vietnamese Laotian capital on Sunday morning fired on Vietnamese military vessels in the Mekong River, prompting the Vietnamese to return fire, resulting in fierce fighting. At 3:00 PM that day, one Thai aircraft attacked the Laotian capital, and two hours later, three Thai bombers and one fighter aircraft again attacked the city, dropping several bombs and strafing the area with gunfire. According to a bulletin issued by Hanoi yesterday, the French retaliated yesterday morning by sending aircraft to attack the Thai army's border base of Nakhon Phanom. The French authorities stated this was a forced action, but it does not mean severing diplomatic relations with Thailand or the French abandoning negotiations, as the Vietnamese side is always ready for peace. Regarding the French retaliatory attack on Nakhon Phanom, the official news agency of the Governor-General of Vietnam stated that although Thai troops had taken a provocative attitude and invaded Vietnamese territory in the past three months, the Vietnamese authorities had maintained a calm attitude and made efforts to negotiate with Thailand. However, repeated acts of aggression could not be tolerated, so the French authorities ordered retaliatory measures. The French airline route between Hanoi, the Laotian capital, and Saigon has been changed to a coastal route via Da Nang to Saigon due to these unfortunate events. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

### Ministry of Finance Formulates Regulations for Regional Tax Bureaus: Implements Independent Assessment and Collection System; Increases Salaries of Personnel at All Levels

Chongqing: In order to reorganize taxation and increase tax revenue, the Ministry of Finance formulated a plan last year to adjust the tax structure of the provinces, changing the three-tier system to a two-tier system, in order to achieve a sound organization, flexible operation, and improve the status and salaries of tax personnel, so as to attract talent. The Taxation Department is now actively proceeding in accordance with the original plan. The Ministry of Finance has now formulated regulations for regional and sub-bureaus of taxation, which have been promulgated and will be uniformly implemented next year. According to sources, the main point is to have one bureau per province (except for the Sichuan-Kang, Gansu-Ningxia, and two bureaus). Sub-bureaus and inspection offices are established under the regional bureaus to implement independent assessment and collection. The status and salaries of all levels of tax personnel have been improved.

### British Forces Launch Blitzkrieg in Western Egyptian Desert: Cunningham Captures Over a Thousand Italian Troops; Navy and Air Force Assist in Limited Scale

Cairo: British forces in the western Egyptian desert began military operations yesterday, the scope of which is larger than any action the British have taken in Africa since the beginning of the war. The main force of the British army attacked the right flank of the Italian army along the slope. Others are located five or twenty miles south of the Italian army's forward base along the coast, and forty miles inside Egypt. The extent of its development cannot be determined at this time. However, it is known that in the past few weeks, British armored vehicle teams have repeatedly raided enemy lines to probe weaknesses. If the British forward troops can now control the slope, they can threaten the main Italian forces defending the coastal area. With the Italian army defeated in Albania, it is appropriate for the British army to challenge Graziani, the commander-in-chief of the Italian army in Libya, at this time. As the western Egyptian desert action appears to be in its initial stages, the progress of the British army yesterday was only a limited test. It would be premature to discuss its possibilities in detail. What can be stated is that the British army attacked the Italian positions south of Sidi Barrani yesterday at dawn with the assistance of the navy and air force, and within an hour captured the first target, an Italian armed barracks near a well. At the same time, British mechanized units and infantry moved forward and entered positions secretly built by the British army in the area where the two armies had been confronting each other for eight miles. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

Cairo: British military authorities here announced today that at least 1,400 Italian troops were captured in a surprise attack launched by the British army in northwestern Egypt yesterday morning. After the Italian army was completely driven out of Greece, this new blow is the biggest they have suffered. The Italian army's hopes of advancing to Alexandria have now been completely shattered. British troops representing various parts of the British Empire are advancing rapidly along a wide front, which stretches from Sidi Barrani on the coast to the cliffs of the Libyan plateau. At dawn this morning, British troops continued to search for fleeing Italian troops by the bright moonlight, while British warships heavily bombarded the Italian transportation lines east of the Libyan border. Recent British communiqués have also stated that although the British army in Egypt is smaller than the Italian army by 250,000 to 100,000 troops, it is still adopting an offensive posture. The British army is adopting an offensive posture along a thirty-mile front, making the entire northern wing of the Egyptian Italian army feel threatened, and making the Italian transportation line on the coastal road east of Sollum even more threatened. Therefore, this weak transportation line is even easier to be destroyed by artillery fire. The basis of the British offensive was established on Saturday night, when Lieutenant General Wavell, the commander of the British army in Egypt, dispatched the British army's elite mechanized units and infantry to secretly designated attack locations. The Italian army commanded by General Graziani was completely unprepared for the sudden attack by the British army. The sentry posts of the strong Italian army camps, which could see the British lines, clearly did not detect this preparation of the British army. The British army lay in wait and hid themselves on Sunday, waiting for the opportunity to attack, and then suddenly launched an offensive at dawn yesterday. When the British army waited for a long time, their military supplies were buried in the sand to avoid aerial detection. In the initial battles, the British army occupied Gomba Beia and captured at least 1,400 Italian troops. (International dispatch, 10th)

Cairo: Yesterday, the British Empire troops continued to attack the Italian army in the Western Desert under the bright moonlight. The British army's offensive on the Libyan front is aimed at the right wing of the Italian army, with the aim of forcing it to retreat to the sea so that the British Navy can trap it in a desperate situation. According to the latest news, the Italian front line is about seventy-five miles wide. Most of the thousand enemy soldiers captured in Barrani yesterday were Libyan natives. The British Air Force assisted the army in combat very actively, severely damaging Italian motor transport convoys and soldiers. Several Italian airfields were also heavily bombed by British aircraft. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

### Greek Troops Advance Towards Khimara Port in Rain, Snow, and Bitter Cold: Italians Use Rearguard Strength to Cover Retreat; Greek Troops Continue to Make Progress on Northern Front

Athens: This morning, Greek troops bravely advanced towards Khimara on the Adriatic coast, fiercely pressing the entire southern wing of the Italian army along a thirty-five-mile line. If the Greek troops occupy Khimara, the southern Albanian Italian army will be isolated and unable to escape to the sea, as the few remaining docks have been destroyed by bombs. At the same time, it is heard that the entire right wing of the Italian army is continuing to retreat rapidly while the rearguard is putting up a stubborn resistance, moving north into the Dhrinopolis valley. The Greek side claims that the Italian army on the northern front has been driven from key points and is retreating westward. It is said that the bad weather makes it difficult to pursue, which is beneficial to the Italian army's retreat. A Greek communiqué said today, "Our army continued to fight victoriously yesterday and has advanced further." (International News Service dispatch, 10th)

Athens: A Reuters correspondent in Greece reports that Greek troops are cautiously advancing towards Khimara (twenty-two miles west of Argyrokastron, a port between Sarandë and Vlorë), threatening the flank of the Italian army retreating from Sarandë. According to reports, the Italian rearguard is currently resisting the Greek advance stubbornly, with tactics designed to lure out small teams of Greek troops for counterattacks. Greek troops have dispatched cavalry to cover the area to break their plan. Resistance from Italian troops is very strong in the central part of the eighty-mile-long front, and fierce fighting is underway. An order was found on the body of an Italian officer captured by Greek troops in Premeti, instructing him to "execute any Italian soldier who retreats unnecessarily." The true situation of the Italian army can be seen from this. According to detailed reports received regarding the Greek army's occupation of Argyrokastron, the Greek troops attacking the city engaged in fierce battles on the outskirts of the city, fighting hand-to-hand combat from night to morning before driving the Italian army out of its positions and taking advantage of the victory to occupy Argyrokastron in heavy rain and snow. The advance units of the Greek army, which were short of food, saw that the Italian army had destroyed almost all the food and ammunition when they entered Argyrokastron, but many of the abandoned weapons were still intact.

Albanians Assist Greeks in Resisting the Enemy: Ambush and Defeat Retreating Italian Troops

Yugoslav Border: According to reports reaching here from the front lines, 800 Albanian rebels suddenly ambushed Italian troops retreating from Sarandë yesterday. It is reported that three Italian officers and eighty-seven soldiers were killed on the spot, and another one hundred and seventy soldiers were injured. Seventy-five Albanian rebels were killed and one hundred and ninety were injured. At the same time, Greek troops advancing north from Argyrokastron broke through the weak Italian resistance on Sunday evening, occupied the village of Sopotsko, and captured seventy Italian officers and soldiers. In the direction of Moscopole, Greek troops advanced towards the Devol River and occupied the village of Bilisht yesterday morning. In the direction of Premeti, Greek troops advanced forward, only ten kilometers from Tepelenë. (United Press dispatch, 10th)

Premeti Mountain Area: Italian Division Destroyed

Athens: As news came from the central front that an Italian division of 15,000 men had been completely defeated, it was also heard that the Greek troops in the Argyrokastron area had crossed this fallen Italian stronghold and were advancing towards Khimara on the Adriatic coast (twenty-two miles northwest of Argyrokastron). Although the resistance of the Italian troops in various areas is constantly increasing, the Greek troops are still striving to advance to Khimara in order to cut off the retreat of thousands of Italian troops from Sarandë. It is reported that the Italian army is well aware of the danger to the main force retreating from Sarandë, so its rearguard is putting up fierce resistance on all roads. According to reports, the defeated Italian troops have repeatedly tried to lure small teams of Greek troops into ambushes, but the Greek patrol cavalry has acted quickly and repeatedly foiled the Italian army's plans to trap the Greek vanguard. Within the area of Albania currently occupied by Greek troops, it is reported that there are 300,000 residents, two-fifths of the Albanian transportation network, and three-fifths of the agricultural and industrial output. A major battle is said to have occurred between Premeti and Frashër in the central region, where the Greek troops claimed that an Italian division of 15,000 men was completely annihilated. The Greek troops on the northern front are also reported to be continuing to make progress, but the snow is quite deep west of Lake Ohrid, and the Greek advance towards Elbasan, the gateway to Tirana, is inevitably delayed.

Greece Celebrates Victory: Exchange of "Resurrection Kisses"

Athens: All parts of Greece are celebrating this recent victory. The general public is exchanging "Resurrection Kisses" with each other, a custom that is usually only performed when meeting each other on Easter Sunday morning. The residents of Thessaloniki, which has been repeatedly bombed, also gathered in the dark, unlit streets under blackout conditions to sing patriotic songs and slogans. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

Greek King Praises Soldiers: Expresses Gratitude to Britain

Athens: King George II recently issued a proclamation to the Greek army, expressing his joy at the victory of the Greek army and his satisfaction that the Greek army had completed the glorious mission of occupying Argyrokastron, as the occupation of Argyrokastron is extremely important both militarily and in terms of morale. In addition, George II also expressed his great joy and gratitude for the assistance of the British Air Force. Furthermore, a communiqué from the Ministry of Public Security stated yesterday that everything in Greece is now calm and is no longer in the state of panic and turmoil that existed after the start of the Italo-Greek War a month ago. (United Press dispatch, 10th)

### Italy Replaces Supreme Commander: Anxious to Reverse the Decline; Roman Communiqué Explains Reasons for This Move: Admits That the Future of the War Is Full of Difficulties

London: A "Times" diplomatic correspondent stated today that the change of the Italian Supreme Commander further demonstrates the great contribution made by Greece to the Allied countries. The biggest weakness in the Axis powers' armaments is the morale of the Italian army, which has long been known to all. Attacking this weakness will greatly contribute to the victory of the Allied countries. The Italian people are extremely upset to see their beloved leader suddenly eliminated. This is a direct result of the Greek victory. The people who were driven to fight against their will have become even more depressed. The change of the Supreme Commander shows that Mussolini is eager to reverse the decline. Therefore, the Greek army may soon encounter a larger enemy force in its brave war. However, the Greek army has now opened up a situation for the Allied countries that seemed impossible a month ago. From now on, it will preserve its gains and work with the increasing cooperation of the British army to seek new developments. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

Rome: The Italian government issued a special communiqué explaining that the purpose of the recent change in military leadership is to accelerate Italy's war machine. The communiqué stated, "At the beginning of the war, the Italian government was well aware that the future was full of difficulties. If someone considers this change of leadership to be a sign of the danger of an unsuccessful undertaking lacking resonance, then this kind of view is as erroneous as it was in the early stages of the Abyssinian war. As for the so-called slow movement, this change can correct this shortcoming and produce the result of accelerating the war machine and increasing efficiency. The people were not shocked last time when the commander for the Abyssinian campaign was replaced, because the well-disciplined Italian people will be able to unite and trust if there is a real need for a change. Premier Mussolini and the people know that they can trust each other deeply." Another communiqué stated that the Prime Minister met with the outgoing Chief of Staff General Badoglio in Venice, "and the conversation was extremely cordial." As for the new naval commander-in-chief, it is said that because he usually advocates joint operations between the navy and air force, the Prime Minister granted him this position.

### Italian Territory: Brewing Changes. New Riots Continue in Northern Industrial Centers.

Athens: According to news that arrived in Athens yesterday, civil war continues in Italy. A bloody rebellion, even worse than those in Trieste and Turin, has broken out in Florence. It is rumored that the residence of King Emmanuel III is so heavily guarded that it resembles imprisonment by the Blackshirts. Furthermore, according to reports, all radio stations in Italy, except for those broadcasting news from Fascist clubs, have ceased broadcasting. The latest unrest in Italy first occurred on Saturday in Trieste and Turin. It is reported that the Blackshirts opened fire on the crowds. News from Washington reveals that U.S. government officials stationed in Italy are reporting the horrific situation in the country to the United States. Observers here are very interested in this. Confidential reports to the U.S. government indicate that the unrest in Italy is most prominent in the northern industrial centers. It is said that strict rationing, heavy taxation, and military failures have all caused serious backlash among the general population. A senior U.S. government official said that this news indicates that "the internal situation in Italy is very serious, and changes may occur." (International News Agency dispatch of the 10th)

Athens: Radio Sofia reports that anti-Fascist unrest in Italy has not subsided. Most of those resisting the Fascists have been killed by the authorities. (United Press dispatch of the 10th)

### The Dodecanese Islands Become Isolated. Italy Will Be Forced to Abandon Them.

Ankara: According to informed sources, within two to three months, Italy will be forced to abandon the Dodecanese Islands. At present, neither neutral country ships nor Italian ships can reach the islands to contact the 20,000 Italian soldiers or civilians stationed there. (United Press dispatch of the 10th)

### British Air Force Night Raid on Western German Industrial Area. Factories in Dusseldorf Damaged.

London: On Sunday, British bombers again raided the major industrial area of Dusseldorf in Germany (on the east bank of the Rhine) at night. The air raid began at 6 PM. The moonlight was bright, and visibility was good. The bridges over the Rhine were clearly visible. One aircraft bombed from an altitude of several thousand feet, and its crew clearly saw flames erupting from the windows of factories in the main target area. Steel mills producing railway and ship equipment and other war materials were also bombed. According to the Air Ministry, British aircraft dropped huge bombs on the steel mills and hundreds of incendiary bombs on the entire area. As soon as the first bombs fell, three major fires broke out, and many other places also caught fire. The visibility of subsequent British aircraft was obstructed by thick smoke. However, generally, British aircraft did not encounter any difficulties. After returning to base, they all stated that the industrial area had been severely damaged and that many fires were still raging 30 to 40 miles away from the area. (Reuters dispatch of the 10th)

### London: Quiet Night After Major Air Raid

London: London, which struggled under heavy bombardment, was quite surprised last night. After midnight, not a single German aircraft was heard over the British Isles. However, the weather last night was not bad. Informed sources believe that German aircraft used too much fuel and bombs during the attack on London on Sunday, so they could not be deployed until they were replenished. However, transportation lines within Germany were destroyed by the British Air Force, so the supply was delayed. German artillery shelled the coastal area of Dover yesterday, but it was very sporadic. As for the situation in London, today the streets are ankle-deep in broken glass, and there are traces of significant damage everywhere. Seven hospitals, four churches, two hotels were destroyed. Rescue teams are still working to excavate the bodies of victims from the rubble. (International News Agency dispatch of the 10th)

### British Armored Corps Strengthens. Martel Appointed Commander.

London: The British Army has appointed Major General Martel, the inventor of the one-man tank, as the first commander of the new armored corps. This indicates that the British Army's policy of rapidly increasing its armored forces has reached a concrete stage. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)

### Hitler Elaborates on the Main Causes of the European War. Delivers Speech to Thousands of Munitions Workers. Wide Disparities Between Rich and Poor Must Be Eliminated. Germany's Urgent Need for Colonies for Survival.

Berlin: Hitler delivered a speech here today to thousands of munitions workers, forcefully arguing for the inequality between the British Empire and modern Germany, reiterating his demand for territory for German people to migrate and develop, and denouncing the democratic newspapers of Britain. Hitler said that the current war is not only related to the honor and disgrace of a country but is actually a struggle between two opposing worlds. In a slow and low tone, Hitler discussed the form of the British Empire, saying that the gap between the rich and the poor is too large, and we must eliminate this huge disparity. Then, he shouted loudly, "One hundred and forty Germans must be confined to one square kilometer, while other countries have only ten people, or even only one person, per square kilometer!" Hitler continued, "The main reason for this great war is that the whole world does not want a united Germany, knowing that this kind of united Germany will make the demands of its people even more urgent." Hitler mentioned the currency issue, saying, "Shall we collapse because we have no gold? The mark currency based on gold has already collapsed, and the pound sterling can no longer be sold worldwide, but the mark, which is not related to gold, remains consistently strong." Hitler also defended National Socialism, saying, "We have instilled our principles into the army. Thousands of soldiers have now been promoted to officers, and some officials who were just privates 22 years ago. If we fail in this war, it will be the downfall of the German people." Hitler reiterated his efforts to promote disarmament but said that he finally realized that a decisive battle must be fought because others did not want peace. Hitler concluded his speech by saying that Germany would not fail militarily or economically. He expressed deep gratitude for the efforts of German workers, farmers, and women. Once the war is over, they can engage in new work. Hitler finished his speech at 12:39 PM, lasting one hour and thirty minutes. (Reuters dispatch of the 10th)

### Full Text of Hitler's Speech

Berlin: Hitler has not delivered a speech for ten weeks. This afternoon, Hitler addressed 1,000 workers in the German arms industry, explaining the fundamental causes of the current war. First, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, in his capacity as the leader of the Berlin district of the National Socialist Party, gave a welcoming speech on behalf of the 1,000 workers who listened to the speech. Then, at 12:09 PM, Hitler delivered a speech from a steel podium five meters high, saying, "Recently, because of busy affairs and little free time, and because action is more important than talk, I have rarely given speeches. The conflict we are currently encountering is not a question of the victory or defeat of a certain country but a 'struggle between two worlds,' with an extremely significant impact. I intend to briefly explain the main causes of this war, but due to time constraints, what I can talk about is limited to Western Europe only. In terms of ethnic population, Western Europe has 85 million Germans, 46 million British, 45 million Italians, and 27 million French. In terms of the territory ruled by each ethnic group, the British territory reaches as large as 40 million square kilometers, the territory administered by the French is also more than 10 million square kilometers, while the actual usable land controlled by the Italians is only 500,000 square kilometers. As for the Germans, their total 'living space' is only 600,000 square kilometers." Hitler then shifted his tone, asking the audience to pay attention to the disparity in wealth between Germany and Britain, and said angrily, "Britain declares that it cannot reconcile with the organization of National Socialism. It must be known that although we lack British gold, the strength of our country's labor is our capital. I will use this capital to create a career that looks down on the world."

Hitler further pointed out that unless the capitalist world is destroyed, no country can be considered free. Therefore, Germany's war is not against the people of Britain and France. We have not challenged Britain. On the contrary, Britain has openly declared its dissatisfaction with the German system and declared war on Germany. God did not divide the earth in the same way as it is divided today. The current distribution of territories is the result of human effort over the past three hundred years. During this period, the Germans were scattered in all directions, weak, and plagued by internal conflicts, so they did not have time to look far ahead, while other countries divided and occupied the beautiful rivers and mountains of the whole world. Britain created a huge empire, not truly thanks to treaties or mutually agreed agreements, but completed by force. At that time, the Italians and Germans had the same suffering, also divided into several small states fighting each other, consuming their energy, and thus could not maintain their original position in the Mediterranean. However, we can certainly ask, "Is this an immutable situation?" Humans do not live by theories and declarations. Humans work hard and obtain the art of survival from the soil. If the scope of living space obtained by someone is too small, their life will inevitably be poor. Therefore, we all know that the main reason for all tensions is caused by unequal distribution, such as the inequality of wealth between the people, which should be balanced by common sense or force. Therefore, countries should not allow one country to monopolize everything while other countries have nothing. If it is not resolved rationally and fairly, the oppressed countries will have a day to rise up. British Prime Minister Churchill wants to fight, so the two countries went to war. I am particularly saddened by this. I have always hoped that all countries will support each other and benefit from cooperation and mutual assistance. But if our country's enemies are determined to destroy the National Socialist state and want to divide Germany again, then this must be clear. The time for being clear is now beginning. Britain will continue to suffer fresh blows. If Britain wants to seize a position on the continent again, we will resist it. The territory we occupy will not allow any country in the world to take actions against our will. Every German soldier knows that Germany not only has the most elite army in the world but also has the sharpest weapons and sufficient ammunition, which will be proven by facts in the future. Since the war, the ammunition consumed by Germany has only been equivalent to one month's ammunition production. The British Air Force has not yet bombed a single German armaments factory, making it unable to produce. Our country is now continuing to fight with all our determination, material, and spirit, until the last stage of the war. We will never be exhausted. We will decide when the final stage of the war will be. I am watching the opportunity carefully. Some say we can attack the west in the autumn, but I think it is advantageous to wait for good weather. (To be continued) (Haitong dispatch of the 10th)

Painful History of the European War (6)

### The Truth About Britain and France's Hasty Response to the War

This is another chapter from the book "The Tragedy of France" by the French historian André Maurois. The translation is as follows:

One day in late 1935, I was having lunch at Mrs. Leslie's house in London. Her nephew, Winston Churchill, was also present. After the meal, Churchill took my arm and went into a small room. He said to me very frankly, "Mr. Maurois, you should not write any more novels! You should not write any more biographies!"

I was stunned and stared at him blankly.

He continued, "There is only one thing you should do now. You should write an article every day, using different writing styles, to express a fixed point of view. You should shout loudly: The French Air Force could have been the best in the world, but now it has fallen to fourth or fifth place! Germany originally had no air force, but now it has risen rapidly and is about to take the lead in the world's air force! That's all, nothing else. If you can announce this truth to France, if you can force the French to listen to this opinion, it will be a thousand times better than writing about the love affairs of children or the ambitious desires of individuals!"

I replied to him at the time that unfortunately, I was not an aviation expert, and I was not qualified to talk about aviation issues. Even if I did, who would listen to me? I also told him that although I appreciated his advice, I still wanted to write my novels and my biographies.

"You are wrong!" he said in a calm, powerful, and somewhat sarcastic tone. Although his pronunciation was often difficult, it had a special flavor that was quite pleasant to hear. He said, "You are wrong! At this critical moment, the threat of the German Air Force is something that every Frenchman should pay attention to. Your country may be overthrown because of this in the future. Mr. Maurois, you must know that art and literature are certainly beautiful, but art without power is no longer living art."

I never wrote the article that Churchill asked me to write, and I still regret it to this day. But this remark gave me a very deep impression and made me feel uneasy. I have repeatedly decided to inquire about the strength of the French Air Force from the authorities, but every time I heard a response, it was either a clever cover-up or obvious pessimism.

An air force colonel who commanded a Lyon bomber squadron said to me, "Once the war breaks out, my subordinates and I are willing to risk our lives and die for our country, but that's all we can do."

I asked him, "Why is that?"

He counted, "Because our air force has too few people, and the planes are old and dilapidated."

The situation in 1936 was deteriorating day by day, even worse than in 1939. Factories repeatedly went on strike, the government only sought temporary security, and the bureaucratic habits and unreasonable demands of various committees actually made the number of French aircraft manufactured almost equal to zero. In 1937, the number of aircraft manufactured by French factories was unbelievable, only 38 per month. The number of aircraft manufactured in Germany was always more than 1,000 per month.

At that time, labor and management in France hated each other, which made the relationship between the two sides worse. On the German side, the country's manpower and material resources were requisitioned, and everyone was of one mind, preparing for the war of revenge that the government authorities had long foreseen and hoped to realize. At that time, various absurd rumors were still circulating in France, pointing out the various weaknesses of the German government led by National Socialism. This was just a one-sided fantasy of the French. A group of people familiar with the internal situation in Germany, such as the British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Neville Henderson, and the French Ambassador to Germany, André François-Poncet, had been shouting loudly for years and issuing warnings repeatedly. I remember that in the middle of 1937, the two of them had a conversation, and I was also present and briefly recorded it below.

François-Poncet said, "Don't have any illusions about Germany. Germany is strong, and the German authorities know this and are determined to try their strength. Britain and France have only two paths to take at this time: either expand their military equipment with all their strength or immediately establish an understanding with Germany as soon as possible."

I asked at the time, "Is this possible? Is Germany willing to establish an understanding?"

François-Poncet answered with a humorous and sarcastic tone, "Germany doesn't want anything on the surface, but it actually wants everything. Germany wants to drastically change the status quo. Their leaders like magnificent and great celebrations. Do you want to subdue Germany? Please build two giant ladders on both sides of the Rhine, with millions of German youths lined up on one side, holding swastika flags, and millions of French youths lined up on the other side, holding tricolor flags. Call these youths to line up neatly, climb up and down these two ladders, constantly shuttling back and forth. Stop a large ship in the river, and ask the French army commander-in-chief and Hitler to sit opposite each other, leaning on the railing to watch. At that time, there may be an opportunity for Germany and France to establish an understanding, but you must be very strong to have hope. If you rely solely on diplomatic negotiations or other means that Germany despises, and don't build aircraft and tanks, and only know how to draft ultimatums and give speeches, we will inevitably go straight to the road of war, and there is no hope of victory."

François-Poncet was not the only one who knew the strength of Germany. The countries compared the military expenditures of Germany with those of Britain and France, and they already knew that the balance of power in Europe was precarious, so they took precautions and prepared for it. The French Ambassador to Poland, Léon Noël, often said to me that Poland had been trying its best to win Germany's favor after 1936, which was not surprising and could not be blamed on them. They saw that Germany was rearming, while Britain and France had not made the slightest effort to resist. They saw Hitler tear up the Treaty of Locarno in March 1936 and advance into the Rhineland, but France did not take a hand to stop this action. They heard the French Prime Minister say in a broadcast without money: "I will never allow Strasbourg to remain within the range of German artillery shells." But they looked forward to it, but they never saw the French Prime Minister take any substantial action, so their confidence in France inevitably plummeted. Polish dignitaries at the time said to me: "If you are unable to stop Germany from rearming, we will have to make peace with Germany." This was the actual situation at the time. Poland's faith was lost, and Belgium and Yugoslavia also became estranged from us because of this.

The responsibility for such a lack of diplomatic work, abandoning Europe, and allowing Germany to dominate, was no less on Britain than on France. However, Britain encountered the constraints of many powerful groups when it tried to adopt a brave and knowledgeable diplomatic policy. The banking industry only cared about the money lent to Germany and openly hoped to trade with a country that was calling for self-sufficiency. There were also many dignitaries who turned pale at the mention of Bolshevism, being too afraid of it and thinking that National Socialism was a barrier to resist world revolution. Intellectual liberals also led the way in advocating peace at any cost and were willing to unilaterally reduce military equipment. All of this formed a force that fell into Germany's trap.

The ordinary people of Britain and France also felt some of their own weaknesses in their consciousness, so they echoed and strongly opposed the war in 1938. This mentality can be easily understood by looking at the situation at the Munich Conference. American public opinion has severely criticized Chamberlain and Daladier. But the United States did not know the truth of the situation. They did not understand the psychology of the citizens of Paris and London. The people of Britain and France only saw that they had no shelters to avoid air raids, no gas masks, no anti-aircraft guns, plus Germany's best efforts to publicize that two tons of bombs could turn the entire city into ashes in an instant, and that the use of aircraft to release poisonous gas could suffocate countless people, so people were even more panicked. If they were actually fighting on the front lines, they would fight bravely against the enemy as they did in 1914, but when they thought of the wives, children, and old people in the rear, who were going to suffer tragically, they could not help but feel sentimental and lose their heroic spirit.

Therefore, although the Munich Agreement was condemned as shameful in New York, the people of Paris and London welcomed it enthusiastically. The situation at that time was almost unbelievable. Diplomatic concessions were celebrated as victories. A member of the Paris City Council even suggested renaming a street in Paris "September Road" to commemorate this day of surrender.

I have met Mr. Chamberlain, the protagonist who presided over the negotiations of the Munich Agreement, in Paris. It was an incredible adventure that this British Prime Minister, who had been the mayor of Birmingham and used to value the sanctity of contracts, would actually meet face-to-face with a German head of state who was not responsible to anyone except Germany and had no effective agreement other than being beneficial to the German people.

One day in November 1938, two months after Chamberlain and Hitler met, he told me in the Foreign Office about the welcome he received in Berchtesgaden, Germany. Hitler had said to him, "Shall we talk alone, or shall we talk with your colleagues?"

Chamberlain replied, "Let's talk alone." (To be continued)

### Public Buses Operating Outside the Boundary: The Municipal Council Has Lodged a Protest, Considering It an Infringement of Traffic Business Rights. However, a Certain Party Ordered Rickshaws to Obtain Licenses.

Regarding the matter of Japanese merchants' public buses operating without authorization in the West Shanghai area, the Municipal Council has received protests from the British Public Bus Company and the Tram Company. Both companies claim that their patent privileges have been violated by the new routes of the Japanese public buses. Currently, Japanese merchants' public buses are still picking up Chinese people at two blocked areas outside the intersections of Yih Ting Pan Road and Great Western Road, and Yu Yuan Road, allowing them to pass through the blocked areas. However, foreigners must get off the bus and are not allowed to pass through. The Japanese military police say that they are ordered to only allow Chinese people to ride the buses and pass through the obstacles, and foreigners are not allowed to do so. As for the rumor that the blockade will be lifted on Saturday, it is only speculation and has not been officially confirmed.

According to a Municipal Council announcement, "Regarding the infringement of the Municipal Council's licensed traffic business rights in the areas outside the boundary of West Shanghai, the Chairman of the Municipal Council has lodged a protest with the Japanese Consul General."

Ordering Rickshaws to Obtain Certificates

Although a certain party announced that it would lift the blockade in the West Shanghai area on Saturday (the 14th), the Japanese side has made further encroachments on the Municipal Council's jurisdiction in the area where roads are built beyond the boundary. Yesterday, a certain party distributed leaflets in the area, informing rickshaw pullers that they must obtain a certificate issued by them before Monday at No. 1, Lane 92, Great Western Road, before they can enter the area. The amount of the fee to be paid has not been announced.

Planned Infringement of Authority

According to a certain foreign observer speaking to a Datong News Agency reporter, this move is actually a planned and organized division of the Municipal Council's jurisdiction over the West Shanghai area. This action is less than a week after the Japanese merchants' public buses entered the area to operate, and its actions clearly violate the regulations on the land in Yangjingbang, because the regulations stipulate that only certificates issued by the Municipal Council are valid for vehicles operating on roads built beyond the boundary. Now that a certain party has notified rickshaw pullers that they must obtain a certificate before they can enter the area, it can also notify car drivers in the future to obtain new licenses in the same way.

The Council Will Make Appropriate Considerations

Two weeks ago, a truck from the Jardine Matheson & Co. was stopped by a mercenary police officer in West Shanghai. At that time, the truck was fined because it did not have a certificate from a certain party. Later, it was released through the efforts of the Police Commissioner of the Municipal Council. According to Mr. Philip Felling, the General Secretary of the Municipal Council, speaking to a reporter, the Municipal Council is now waiting for the Police Department to submit a report on this matter so that it can make appropriate considerations.

Continuing to Search Chinese Residences

Yesterday, the situation in the blocked area of West Shanghai remained calm on the surface, but the Japanese military police continued to search Chinese residences on Yih Ting Pan Road in order to crack down on the so-called "terrorist" "nests." It is not yet known whether the Japanese side has captured any criminals in the western district so far. It is generally believed that a large number of Chinese people have been detained at the Japanese military police headquarters on Great Western Road for questioning.

The Assault on Police Officers is Still Under Study

A spokesman for the Municipal Council said yesterday that regarding the incident in which five police officers of the Public Concession were assaulted, insulted, and detained by the Japanese military police in the western district, the Municipal Council is still studying the report submitted by Police Commissioner Bowen on the 9th. The Council has not yet decided what steps to take, as it must study the report in detail before it can make a decision.

### A Group of American Residents Depart Shanghai Last Night

Many Will Not Return to China

The wife of the American Consul General also returns home. Seventy-nine American residents in Shanghai, along with twelve Chinese, totaling ninety-one people, departed Shanghai last night (the 10th) aboard the President Cleveland liner to return to the United States. Therefore, they were busy throughout the day yesterday purchasing necessary items and bidding farewell to relatives and friends. Among them, quite a few will not return to Shanghai. The last ferry for sending off passengers departed from the Customs Wharf at 6:45 PM yesterday. The President Cleveland then weighed anchor and departed, heading to the United States via Japan. Furthermore, tickets for the President Coolidge liner, which departs Shanghai on December 31st, have also been completely booked. It is said that the ship will carry dozens of American missionaries serving in the Chinese interior back to the United States. Many of them planned to board the three ships sent by the American government for evacuating American citizens but were unable to arrive in Shanghai in time and had to wait to board the President Coolidge for departure. Among the American residents of Shanghai who departed last night aboard the President Cleveland, the wife of the American Consul General to China, Mrs. Helmick, was also among them.

A Sailor Dies of Sudden Illness

At around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, a robust middle-aged Westerner suddenly collapsed on Guangdong Road in the Public Concession. A patrolman discovered him and upon inspection found that he was barely breathing. He urgently summoned an ambulance to transport him to the Country Hospital, but it was too late to save him, and he died shortly after. Afterwards, the Lao Zha Police Station conducted a detailed investigation and learned that the Westerner was named Hely, O. T. Hely, in his thirties. He was a sailor on the President Cleveland liner, which recently evacuated American citizens. He died of acute heart failure.

Jackson Liner to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow Morning

The United States President Lines' newly built world-class mail ship, the first of seven, the President Jackson, has been completed and set sail. Details have been reported in previous issues. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive today, but it is now known that it will be delayed until 7:00 AM tomorrow (the 12th) and will berth at buoys 14 and 15. Passengers will transfer to a small launch and disembark at 9:00 AM tomorrow morning. The ship will only stay in Shanghai for one night and is scheduled to weigh anchor at 7:30 AM on the morning of the 13th for its maiden voyage to Hong Kong, Manila, and various ports in Southeast Asia, returning to the United States via the Cape of Good Hope. The time of the last passenger launch has not yet been determined but will probably be at 1:00 AM tomorrow night (i.e., the morning of the 13th) from the New Customs Wharf. However, since the launch has not been confirmed and would occur during curfew hours, passengers can board an earlier launch at 9:00 PM tomorrow evening.

Chisandaney Arrives Slightly Later

The Java Mail Ship Company's Chisandaney mail ship, which was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Surabaya, arrived at the mouth of the harbor at 6:25 PM yesterday evening due to adverse weather conditions at sea, later than its planned noon arrival. It berthed at 9:00 PM at the Pootung Blue Funnel Wharf. Passengers disembarked at the New Customs Wharf by small launch at 10:30 PM last night.

### Estimating Additional Tax Amounts: The Bureau Considers It Too Early, but Declares It Will Inevitably Extract More from the Public to Increase Salaries by Over 900,000 Monthly

The Municipal Council issued a public notice yesterday regarding the increase in allowance amounts, stating that the Municipal Council recently approved an increase in various allowances for all staff, estimating an additional monthly expenditure of approximately $935,000. The breakdown is as follows:

(1) Foreign Staff (2) Chinese Staff

As the services of the Municipal Council are similar to other public utilities, the need to extract more from the public as a result of this increase in allowances is virtually certain. However, estimating the amount of tax increase before the Finance Committee discusses next year's budget is still too early.

### Police Inspector Mills of the Police Department Resigns to Return to the United States

Ten Years of Service, Repeatedly Demonstrating Outstanding Achievements

Colleagues Bid Farewell with a Farewell Dinner

Police Inspector Jack Mills of the Public Concession Police Department, who has served at the Jing'an Temple Police Station for ten years, repeatedly demonstrating outstanding achievements, recently resigned from the Municipal Council and is scheduled to take his wife and children and return to the United States on Friday.

### Negotiations Underway Regarding the Governor-General of Vietnam Auctioning Chinese Goods Detained in Vietnam

Following reports that the Governor-General of Vietnam had ordered the customs authorities to put up for auction and confiscate goods from Shanghai, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou that were detained in Saigon and other places in Vietnam, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Economic Affairs, requesting them to negotiate. The Chamber received a reply telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, stating, "The Ministry received a report on this matter earlier and is currently actively negotiating. [Stamped: Ministry of Foreign Affairs]"

### Hong Kong's Immigration Restriction Ordinance Postponed Until Next Year: Officially Implemented on January 14th: Free Entry and Exit Between Shanghai and Hong Kong Currently Allowed

Hong Kong, as a British territory in the Far East, has become increasingly important since the Japanese army feigned a southward advance. In addition to actively fortifying the area, the Hong Kong authorities are also restricting the entry of undesirable elements, establishing an immigration bureau to implement import restrictions. The Hong Kong government promulgated a new Immigration Control Ordinance on the 20th of last month, stipulating that people of any nationality who do not hold a legally recognized passport or import permit approved by the British authorities will not be allowed to land. The detailed regulations and plans for the import control scheme were published in this newspaper on the 22nd of last month and were scheduled to take effect on the 18th of this month.

Many Certificate Applicants Unable to Complete Procedures

It is heard that the number of Chinese and foreign people applying for registration and obtaining entry permits from the Hong Kong Immigration Bureau has been extremely crowded recently. According to reliable news from Hong Kong received by the China Travel Service yesterday, there are too many certificate applicants since the ordinance was promulgated, and the Immigration Bureau is unable to process them in time, fearing that they will not be able to issue them as scheduled. It has now officially announced a postponement until January 14th of next year. Therefore, within this month, people traveling to Hong Kong can still enter and exit freely.

Hong Kong and Tianjin No Longer Require Epidemic Certificates

Furthermore, those traveling to Hong Kong and Tianjin previously had to prepare two types of certificates: epidemic certificates and smallpox vaccination certificates. Currently, both Hong Kong and Tianjin have cancelled the epidemic certificate requirement, but smallpox vaccination certificates are still required. According to a notice issued by the Port Affairs Department of the Jianghai Customs regarding the cessation of inspection of ships sailing to Shanghai from Hong Kong and Macao, due to the prevalence of cholera in Hong Kong and Macao, all ships arriving in Shanghai from those ports were subject to inspection, as stated in Notice No. 12 posted by this department on September 7th of this year. As there are currently no such epidemics in those ports, all ships arriving at this port from those ports will cease to be inspected from now on.

A senior official of the French Police Department confirmed this on the 9th, stating that the French Police Department has not taken this action, and Chinese police officers have not requested higher allowances, as their current salaries are equal to those of Chinese police officers in the Public Concession.

### Dr. Baker to Arrive in Shanghai Soon

Departed Kunming Yesterday, Heading to Chongqing via Guiyang

Dr. Baker, director of the China Relief Division of the American Red Cross and director-general of the China International Famine Relief Commission, previously planned to take the opportunity of returning to the United States to travel across America, appealing to the people of the New World to sympathize with and help Chinese disaster victims, and jointly launched a donation campaign with his friends to rescue innocent refugees in the war-torn areas of China who are suffering from hunger and cold. Recently, his public affairs in the United States having been completed, he returned to China via the Burma Road, inspecting the situation in the rear of China and opening up new avenues for relief, while also understanding the transportation conditions in the Southwest in order to transport a large quantity of medicines to China. It is now learned that Dr. Baker departed Kunming yesterday via Guiyang for Chongqing. As soon as the affairs in Chongqing are completed, he will set off for Shanghai to take charge of relief work here.

The French Consul General specially sent a representative to Cheng's residence yesterday to present the medal. Cheng accepted it humbly.

### British Ship Detained Outside Wusongkou

Jiangsu Released and Returned to Shanghai, Mafeili Not Yet Released

Since the Jianghai Customs stopped customs clearance, shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang has changed routes one after another. However, sailing is not always safe. The British merchant ships Jiangsu and Yufeili sailed one after another from Shanghai to the north of the Yangtze River some days ago. When they arrived outside Wusongkou, they were detained by Japanese warships. The Jiangsu was released and returned to Shanghai yesterday, while the Mafeili was detained until 8:00 AM yesterday, forced by Japanese warships to dock at Guojiazui, and has not yet been released. The reason for the detention is still unclear.

### Foreign Media Reports Epidemic in Jinhua

According to a report in the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, Jinhua, Zhejiang, has been heavily bombed by Japanese planes for the past two days, and a plague is rampant, with several hundred people dying from the epidemic. The local authorities are making every effort to eradicate the epidemic. It is heard that American missionaries in Jinhua have urgently telegraphed Shanghai, requesting the allocation of preventive vaccines to assist the authorities in stopping the plague. However, this newspaper has not yet received confirmation from Chinese sources in this port regarding the report that there is an epidemic in Jinhua and that hundreds of people have died.

### Japanese Warships Shell and Japanese Planes Bomb Chaiqiao Again

According to reliable news from the shipping industry, at 9:08 AM on the 9th, a loud engine sound was heard northeast of Longshan, and a second-level air raid alert was issued in Ningbo. Two Japanese planes were then discovered circling over Chuanshan for a long time. They attacked Chaiqiao, dropping two bombs, destroying eleven houses. They also blindly dropped a bomb on Xiaopu shoal, which landed in an open space without causing any damage. The air raid alert was lifted at 9:59 AM, with the Japanese planes heading northwest. On the afternoon of the 8th, a Japanese warship anchored outside Zhenhaikou suddenly opened fire and shelled the south bank of the Yangtze River indiscriminately. Two shells landed near the coast without causing any damage.

### Eighth Phase of Low-Price Grain Sales to Commence on January 2nd: Various Industries Pledge Another 20,000 Yuan for Low-Price Grain: Two Flour Mills Sell Low-Price Flour, Government Expresses Gratitude

The Shanghai Low-Price Grain Committee held a plenary committee meeting at its office at 93 Guangdong Road at 3:00 PM yesterday, resolving (1) to continue handling the low-price grain case, deciding to continue the eighth phase of low-price grain sales for ten days starting from January 2nd of the 30th year (2) regarding the continued fundraising for the low-price grain donation, to continue soliciting donations from various industries. On the spot, various groups such as the bean and rice industry, miscellaneous grain and oil cake industry, yarn factory industry, cotton cloth industry, rice store industry, and money shop industry pledged to continue raising over 200,000 yuan for the low-price grain donation. Representatives of the other industries all agreed to convene their colleagues to discuss and report further. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM. According to a committee member of the association, handling low-price grain sales requires a large amount of funds. At a time when rice is as expensive as pearls and firewood is as precious as cinnamon, the lives of ordinary people are in imminent danger. Handling low-price grain sales to alleviate the pain of the common people is a matter of the utmost urgency. It is hoped that enthusiastic people will participate in this good cause.

Rice Prices Fall: Rice Store Tea Market Opens as Usual Yesterday Morning at 9:00 AM: The Initial Market is Calm: People are Very Stable: The General Speculative Rice Merchants Fear Punishment and Conceal Their Tracks in the Market and Dare Not Continue to Use Old Tricks: At the Same Time, Customers Feel Weak: Large Households also Lower Prices to Supply the Market Due to the Price Limit on Foreign Rice: The Current Stock Code Increases Sharply and Shows Excess Supply, Resulting in Prices Falling One to Two Yuan Below the Limit Price: The Situation Shows Rice Prices Will Continue to Decline: The Various Measures Taken by the Two Concessions Seem to Have Taken Effect: It is Hoped That the Authorities Will Take Further Steps to Sanction Illegal Rice Merchants: Strict Punishment Should be Imposed on Those Who Raise Prices for Profit and Spread False Rumors: At the Same Time, Price Limits Should Also be Imposed on the Market Prices of Domestic Rice: The Already Established Price Limits for the Five Types of Foreign Rice Should be Lowered at the Right Time to Comfort the People:

Market Notice

The Rice Store Tea Market announced to the trade in the morning that they must strictly abide by the highest foreign rice prices determined by the conference convened by the Public Works Department and must not exceed them without authorization. Severe penalties will be imposed on those who dare to violate them. It also issued Notice No. 170, stating: "The winter entry permits for this market for this year will expire soon. Four photos per person are required for the 30th-year entry permit. In addition to those who have already submitted them, all those who have not submitted them or have not submitted them completely must send them to the association before the 20th of this month for verification and certification. Those who fail to do so will be cancelled. This notice is hereby announced so that they will not be delayed."

Foreign Flour to Arrive

For the past year, the flour market in this port has been relatively stable, although prices have repeatedly risen, unlike the rice industry, which is in disarray and the rice price is unstable. The reason for this is that Fufeng and Fuxin flour mills are willing to supply low-priced flour. The Public Works Department believes that their spirit of sacrifice in regulating people's food is worthy of praise. It is heard that Vice President He Deqing recently visited the general managers of the two factories to express his gratitude. Currently, Fufeng still supplies 2,483 bags of low-priced flour every day, and Fuxin supplies 3,100 bags. The factory price is 18 yuan per bag (the flour store retail price plus a handling fee of 30 cents), which is one to two yuan lower than the general price. This has a significant effect on stabilizing the flour market. It is also learned that Fuxin has already reordered a large batch of foreign wheat, which can be shipped to Shanghai for flour production next month. In addition, foreign flour will be shipped to the port one after another this month, so there is no shortage of flour supply in this port. If the two factories and the authorities can maintain their past spirit, cooperate closely with the Public Works Department, and consider the needs of users, then flour prices can be lowered. As for the report that noodle stores are raising prices, this matter has not been approved by the Public Works Department, so the price increase is completely inaccurate.

### Zhejiang Local Bank to Issue One-Yuan Notes

Usable Simultaneously in Shanghai

The Zhejiang Local Bank's head office, in accordance with central government policy, promoted provincial currency and submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance for approval to issue one-yuan notes. They have now been printed and will soon be issued and circulated on the market. In addition to reporting to the ministry for record, the bank recently sent two sample notes, numbered 11012, to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for verification. On the Shanghai side, as soon as the printing is completed, they can be issued and circulated on the market simultaneously.

### US Ranks First in Sino-American Trade in October

### Dredging Work Expanded: Survey Completed

Since the Shanghai Port Dredging Bureau resumed dredging of the Huangpu River this spring, the detained dredgers have been returned one after another. According to statistics from the bureau, the area dredged from January to September this year reached 260,000 cubic mu, and the amount of mud dredged was over 200,000 tons. Currently, the surveying work for the Huangpu River dredging project has been completed, and large-scale dredging will begin soon. The bureau's large dredger Hailong, which it possessed before the war, has not yet been repaired and has been leased to the Dutch Shanghai Zhiyong Company, the Hong Kong, to assist in the dredging work.

Renting a Ship in Pairs

Currently, the bureau's dredging operations include several small dredgers, such as Haili, Haibao, and Haihu, dredging in the upper, middle, and lower sections of the Huangpu River and the upper section of Wusongkou. The large dredger Hong Kong, leased from the Dutch Water Control Company, is dredging in Shentan. The bureau's own large ship Hailong will also dredge the Huangpu River after its repairs are completed. The amount of mud dredged from the Huangpu River this autumn is estimated to be 50,000 tons.

Building Berth in Shanghai

The large dredger Jianshe, which used to dredge the Yangtze River, has been berthed on the Huangpu River opposite the Jinliyuan Wharf. The ship has been idle for a long time. Recently, the Shan Junpu Bureau hired workers to repair it on board. However, because the ship's hull is too large to dredge the Huangpu River, it will continue to dredge various sections of the Yangtze River after the repairs are completed.

### Cargo Ship Not Arrived, Ship Already Left Port: Goods Returned for Re-inspection

Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, Mr. Lawford, wrote to the Shanghai Meishi Customs Brokers Association, stating that if merchants have goods that are returned from customs, they must immediately notify the ship's customs officer for certification in order to enjoy the benefits of customs return. This was previously announced by the General Affairs Department of this customs on June 6 of this year in Notice No. 114. Subsequently, if goods are transported by cargo ship to export ships berthed in the heart of the river or outside Wusongkou, and if the export ship has left the port before the cargo ship has arrived, the cargo ship should be immediately sailed back to the original inspection wharf so that customs officers can re-inspect and certify them. Furthermore, the port affairs department of the customs announced that there are no longer any cholera epidemics in Hong Kong and Macao, and ships arriving at this port should immediately stop quarantine.

### Paper Mounting Industry Reduces Prices for Business: Punished by Association

The Shanghai Paper Mounting Industry Association's Rules and Disciplinary Committee deliberated on a report from the investigation team some days ago, stating that two paper mounting shops in the association were improperly accepting business, violating industry rules. After deliberation by the industry rules disciplinary committee, it was concluded that the two shops did reduce prices to accept paper mounting products, which did violate industry rules. However, considering that they were first-time offenders, they were each fined 100 yuan in national currency as a warning. The deliberation team decided that in order to prevent the recurrence of abuses, the paper products of the customers of the two shops that were penalized will still be jointly produced by members of the cooperative, to prove it. Otherwise, the paper products of those customers will be prohibited, and the association's members will not be allowed to interact with them in order to avoid disruption.

### Thousands of Undesirable Japanese Citizens Profiting in China: These People Have Nothing of Their Own Except Themselves: They Exploit the Precarious Environment to Enrich Themselves: Japanese Military Authorities to Repatriate Them to Their Country

A certain Japanese official told a reporter from the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury yesterday (the 10th) that some Japanese people in China have nothing but themselves and are only interested in making profits. They are now being forcibly repatriated to Japan by the Japanese authorities in accordance with the recent orders issued by the Japanese Army authorities. Since Japanese citizens automatically followed the Japanese army into China, their goal of quickly obtaining profits has reached thousands of people. Although some Japanese are engaged in legal commerce, a large number of Japanese are alone and have nothing but themselves. They take advantage of the precarious and unstable situation in the occupied areas to enrich themselves. In view of this, the Japanese authorities have recently adopted measures to restrict Japanese people from coming to China. In the future, only a certain number of Japanese citizens, all of whom must represent well-known Japanese commercial firms or have substantial guarantees, will be allowed to come to China. At the same time, the Japanese authorities in China are currently investigating the nature and business of Japanese citizens in the occupied areas in order to repatriate undesirable Japanese citizens to their country.

### Chinese Residents All Advocate for Revision of Draft Regulations on Rent in the French Concession

The various subcommittees of the French Concession Rent Mediation Committee are still continuing to solicit opinions from residents within the concession regarding the draft regulations on rent. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency inquired with the Chinese group yesterday. It is learned that the various subcommittees have received a considerable number of opinion letters from foreign residents and Chinese residents. The Chinese side believes that the items described in the draft regulations are inconsistent with Chinese legal rights and advocates that they must be revised. After the collection period for opinions from all parties is over, the proposed rent draft regulations will be revised, and then the rent mediation regulations will be officially determined, and mediation of rent disputes within the concession will begin.

Afterward, the store owner reported the incident to the police, who are investigating.

The night before last, at approximately 9:00 PM, three robbers suddenly broke into the tour guide company at No. 418, Andong Hotel, Hubei Road.

### Luring Elementary School Students, Stripping Velvet Clothes, One Offender Caught at the Door

Zhao Chuan, a seven-year-old boy residing at No. 38 Zhao Jiaqiao, Hart Road, whose father is Ningbo native Yin Jinsheng, and Guo Zhi, an eight-year-old boy, the son of a woman surnamed Jiang Xu, who lives with them, both attend the nearby Huanan Elementary School. At approximately 3:10 PM on the 9th, the two boys were returning home from school when they were stopped by Liu Hua, who is at large, and Xu Erbao from Huzhou. They showed the boys two water caltrop toys, claiming they would take them to the playground. They lured them to a lane on Xiaoshadu Road, Xinzha Road, and stripped them of their three wool sweaters, worth over ten yuan, before fleeing. The two boys cried in the lane. Passersby took them home. Yin Jinsheng, the father of one of the boys, inquired about the incident. Suspecting that the criminals would pawn the clothes nearby, he went to the Li Zhong Pawnshop near No. 7 Jiao Jiao, Gordon Road. He found Xu with the three sweaters, attempting to pawn them. He apprehended him and handed him over to police officer Yin of District 45, along with the stolen goods. They were sent to the Special First Court yesterday. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and requested a postponement. After Yin and Jiang explained the details and the defendant was questioned, he confessed that a friend named Liu Hua, who is at large, had committed the crime, instructing him to pawn the clothes and seek leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him detained and postponed the hearing for further investigation.

It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Police is aware of this and will prohibit it.

### Transporting Cloth for Pawn, Two Offenders Each Sentenced to One Year

Recently, Rongchang Cloth Shop at No. 214 Tianjin Road planned to transport 210 bolts of cloth, worth 9,700 yuan, to Suzhou. Through the introduction of Tang Zongyao from Zhejiang, the shipment was entrusted to the Shenchang Transport Company at Haitong Pier, North Suzhou Road, on October 22. However, due to difficulties in obtaining a certificate, the goods could not be shipped. Tang colluded with Wang Jiayi, an employee of Shenchang, to steal the cloth and instructed Wang Qiuxiang, an employee of Nanlai Pawnshop at No. 562 Zhejiang Road, to pawn it at various pawnshops, obtaining 4,200 yuan, which they split and spent. Rongchang discovered the theft and reported it to the Zhabei Police Station.

### Takahashi Couple Homicide Case: Murderer Arrested, Case of Theft Leading to Murder

On the morning of November 5, at approximately 4:00 AM, the Japanese couple, Mr. and Mrs. Takahashi, residing at No. 222, Dongyang Street, Dixiwei Road, Hongkou, were stabbed to death by someone who broke in through their window. The murderer fled without a trace. The incident occurred over a month ago, causing considerable anxiety among the Japanese residents of Hongkou. Japanese police officers were dispatched to investigate and apprehend the criminal. They thoroughly investigated all individuals connected to the Takahashis, but found no suspicious leads. The incident appeared to be a purely opportunistic theft. Therefore, they closely monitored Dongyang Street, Dixiwei Road, Xie Jiaqiao, Changchun Road, and other areas, conducting special investigations among suspected thieves, hoping to find a clue. As a result, they learned from a noodle vendor at a certain gambling den that the criminal was hiding in the New Central Hotel at No. 27, Dekang Lane, Qiujiang Road. On the night of the 6th, at 11:30 PM, Police Chief Yoshikawa led his entire department to surround the hotel and apprehend Chang Baojin from Taixing (23 years old, nicknamed "Little Carpenter") and Lin Chunrong from Gaoyou (26 years old, nicknamed "Little Sixth").

### Food: Repeated Price Limits Are Announced After New Peak Prices Are Created

Approximately Twenty Yuan Price Increase is Expected

The old price limits can be abandoned, and new price limits are not set. After a brief decline following previous government intervention, the rice market grew tighter yesterday, and the people felt very little certainty. The wind of speculation subsided, and large merchants and hoarders, knowing that the market would fall, all sold off their rice. Actual retailers had all stopped buying, resulting in a glut of goods and a situation where only rice was leaving the market. From morning to noon, the rice was being dumped, but it was difficult to find buyers. As a result, few transactions took place, and the prices of all grades of foreign rice fell by two yuan. The prices were as follows: Saigon No. 1: 86.60 yuan, 85.50 yuan; No. 2: 80.02 yuan, 79.50 yuan; Fire-milled: 85 yuan, 84.50 yuan; Siam No. 2: 78 yuan, 77.30 yuan; Small-milled: 78 yuan, 77.50 yuan; Rice Germ: 73.30 yuan; Broken: 71.50 yuan, 69 yuan; Tokyo Pointed: 72 yuan; Wuhu Machine Pointed: 76 yuan. In addition to the continuous arrival of goods in transit, new transactions were also completed one after another. Hezhong Foreign Firm sold 1,000 tons of Saigon No. 2 for January delivery at 87 yuan, and 2,000 tons of broken rice for late January/early February delivery at 63.10 yuan. It is also possible that another 2,000 tons of Xiaowen rice and 1,000 tons of Saigon rice will be finalized. In this case, the rice merchants have completely won out. All one needs to do is look at how the price limits have increased, from 40 yuan to over 60 yuan to over 80 yuan. Only after creating the highest price and the hoarders have made huge profits do they begin to regulate themselves. After a price limit is imposed, they wait a few days before starting another manipulation. Without fair evaluation and ineffective price limits, they come out again to offer a show. This is the consistent approach of rice merchants and domestic hoarders. Therefore, to maintain the safety of the people’s food supply in the future, they must no longer use excuses to speculate. Only then can the rice market move toward stability. However, after the people's confidence returned yesterday, many speculators and small investors emerged, but retailers were hesitant. The market immediately rose by one or two yuan. The number of transactions yesterday was only four or five thousand bags of rice. This manipulation by rice merchants has given the increased rice price a basis. The techniques of the rice merchants are commendable.

Although the supply of thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice remains difficult, some has arrived in port, so the people's confidence has stabilized slightly. In addition, the market has implemented price limits, and the price of foreign rice has repeatedly fallen. Shops are taking a conservative approach and are only making small purchases to meet demand. There are few wholesale transactions. Retailers are very cautious, and sellers, knowing that the market is weak, are more willing to sell, so prices continue to fall. Kun japonica is quoted at 96 yuan per dan, special grade at 99 yuan; thin japonica at 90 yuan, 89.50 yuan per dan.

The situation of glutinous rice has made it difficult to stand alone and the trend is shifting. Both domestic and foreign goods have fallen by about one yuan. Liyuan is quoted at 97 yuan, 95 yuan; Hong Kong yuan at 86.50 yuan, 83 yuan. (The market announcement set the price limit for Saigon No. 1 at 87 yuan, No. 2 at 81.50 yuan, High Fire-Milled at 86 yuan, Siam No. 2 at 80 yuan, and Small-Milled at 79 yuan.)

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Taigu Company's "Ganzhou" ship brought 643 bags from Hong Kong. Today, the French Company's "Dat De Nam" mail ship will bring a large amount of foreign rice directly from Saigon. The exact number is unknown. The exact number will be reported after the ship arrives in Shanghai. (Zu)

### Australian Flour: Over 190,000 Bags Newly Arrived, Another Ship Coming Soon

According to market news, a total of over 300,000 bags of Australian flour have arrived or are scheduled to arrive. The agreed price is only 18.23 yuan. It is reported that Weida Foreign Firm's reply telegram confirmed the shipment of over 30,000 bags of Cambell flour. The goods that were negotiated last week are all scheduled to be shipped in January. Yesterday, Clock Tower and Flower Bird brand spot flour was sold at 19.85 yuan, and goods in transit at 19.80 yuan. A total of over 4,000 bags were sold. Level-priced flour was still selling at 18 yuan, with Shanliang Factory distributing about 6,000 bags.

The wheat market is generally stable. The purchase price of Japanese flour is 28 yuan, and the retail price in the concession market is 30 yuan, but there have been no wholesale transactions. Foreign wheat that Chinese factories have arranged to purchase has not been finalized due to a lack of ships. Therefore, the market is in a quiet process again.

### Oil Market: Speculation in Futures Creates Waves

Yesterday, only a small amount of spot oil was inquired about on this street, so the trend was flat. However, futures were lively, and the market was still being stirred up by speculation. The market was turbulent throughout the day, and as a result, prices were slightly lower by 4 or 5 jiao compared to the previous day. Spot transactions included 100 dan of soybean oil from Dayou Factory at 86 yuan, 50 pieces of Yantai soybean oil at 79 yuan, 130 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil at 77 yuan, 400 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil at 80.05 yuan, and new goods at 83 yuan. 50 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were priced at 112 yuan to 111 yuan.

### Economic Discussions: Dried Tobacco (1)

— Feng Liutang

When did tobacco enter China? This is unknown. Scholars generally believe that the origin of tobacco is South America. But according to ancient accounts, tobacco was introduced to China from Luzon during the Ming Dynasty. This is very likely. Although the "History of the Ming Dynasty" does not mention the production of tobacco in Luzon, there were already many Chinese residing in Luzon during the Ming Dynasty, even before the arrival of the Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch. This can be seen in the "History of the Ming Dynasty," which states:

"Luzon is located in the South Sea, very close to Zhangzhou… During the Wanli era, the Franks were strong and traded with Luzon. Over time, they saw that the country was weak and could be taken… Taking advantage of their lack of preparation, they attacked and killed their king, drove out their people, and seized their country. The name remained Luzon, but it was actually Frankish. Before this, many people from Fujian went there to trade because it was close and prosperous, and often stayed there for a long time, even with their children and grandchildren…” It is important to know that the earliest Chinese to go abroad were people from Fujian. From historical records, all sea routes originated in Quanzhou and Zhangzhou. After the Portuguese occupied Macau, the routes gradually shifted south. Guangzhou became the center of Sino-Western communication after the British began their eastward expansion. Therefore, the name "tambaaco" first appeared in the "Gazetteer of Zhangzhou." Tambaaco is a Western name. Its scientific name is "Nicotiana tabacum," and its English name is "Tobacco." The Chinese call tobacco "tambaaco." This first appeared in the "Gazetteer of Zhangzhou," indicating that it was introduced by people from Zhangzhou from overseas. As for why it is also called "yan" (烟), it is because it emits smoke when smoked, hence the name. It is also written as "菸" (菸). The original meaning of "菸" is "withered," but the "Guang Yun" dictionary mentions a "stinky grass," so "菸" is also used because tobacco has a stinky smell, taking advantage of the similarity in sound and meaning.

Because tobacco was first imported to Fujian, tobacco from Fujian is still considered the best. However, it is commonly called "Chaozhou tobacco," named after Chaozhou. Even today, tobacco from Guangdong still has a significant presence in Shanghai.

The custom of smoking became widespread in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. Therefore, it is rare to find references to smoking in books from the late Ming Dynasty, but by the Qing Dynasty, the custom of smoking seems to have spread to all parts of the country, making it easier to find records of smoking. (To be continued)

Tianjin British and American Exchange Retracted

Tianjin, 10th (Tuesday) Dispatch. This morning, the exchange market opened flat. The London cable exchange tightened by .0625 to 4 pence and 1875 yuan. The New York cable exchange also softened by .0625 to 6 yuan and 625 yuan. The "Union Notes" black market price was unchanged, remaining at 88.50 yuan.

### Gold Market Lacks Vitality

Yesterday, the spot price of cash gold was mediocre and trading was not lively. Transactions were sporadic and small. Prices were still firm. In the morning, due to the slight softening of the exchange market, the price rose past 5,800 yuan, but then quietly fell back within the range. The afternoon market was even less lively, with only small fluctuations of one or two yuan. Therefore, the market closed at 3:00 PM, with a price of 5,786 yuan, with little difference from the previous day. Total daily transactions were 3,000 taels. There were a few swap transactions, and spot transactions were quiet. Banks traded a few hundred taels with each other, with the price 12 yuan lower than futures. Cash houses sold 200 taels to silver houses, at a price of 10 yuan lower.

Cash Gold Shares Honor and Dishonor

Although the market was extremely quiet in the early morning, prices were firm. At the opening, gold and silver houses traded 20 taels at 5,788 yuan, 2 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. Hearing that the exchange market was opening with a softening of the American exchange rate, many people bought in slightly, and the price rose past 5,800 yuan. Silver houses sold 30 taels to gold houses at 5,805 yuan. Afterwards, the market was weak, because the exchange market hardened, and silver houses occasionally sold gold, falling back within the 5,800 yuan range. Silver houses traded 20 taels at 5,778 yuan. By the noon closing, the price had risen slightly. Silver houses traded 20 taels at 5,786 yuan. In the afternoon, the fluctuations were extremely narrow, with no exciting activity. At the opening, silver houses traded 20 taels at 5,786 yuan. Later, silver houses bought 10 taels from gold houses, rising by 1 yuan to 5,787 yuan, while silver houses sold slightly at 5,782 yuan, the lowest price. The market closed with silver houses trading 10 taels again at 5,786 yuan. As a result, the market ended the day with little change from the previous day's closing price. The total fluctuation for the day was only 25 yuan. The selling price of cash gold from cash houses was more than 10 yuan higher than the price of cash gold, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower.

### Foreign Currencies Also Had Little Fluctuation

Yesterday, the foreign currency market had very little fluctuation. The spot price of cash gold gradually stabilized, so there was no significant change in the prices of British and American currency. The price of British gold notes remained stable, and the market price was flat. The price of American gold notes rose to 16 yuan, 7 jiao, 8 fen, but then retreated slightly to 7 jiao, 1 fen, finally closing at 16 yuan, 7 jiao, 4 fen, slightly higher by 1 fen compared to the previous day. The supply and demand of Hong Kong notes were balanced, and the market price was flat. The price of Japanese gold notes trended slightly higher, with the evening price at 1 yuan, 5 jiao, 3 fen, 8 li. The surge in the price of Korean notes started again, with the evening price rising to 1 yuan, 2 jiao, 8 fen and a half.

### Securities Investment and Speculation in Foreign Stocks Both Show Hesitation

The securities grey market was relatively strong yesterday compared to the previous day. There were some short-covering trades in the market. Due to the proximity of the interest payment period, short positions were slightly unsteady. Yesterday's trading saw no major players entering or exiting the market; transactions of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan were frequent. However, on the supply and demand side, the supply was slightly weaker, which resulted in tight market prices. For example, Lianyi, Hengfu, and Shunchang (surnamed Chang) consistently bought throughout the morning and afternoon, while Dahua, Yitai, and Wanchun consistently sold. Hu He Ji first sold and then bought. Hongda, Shengda, Damao, and Daxie all bought in the afternoon, so the afternoon's rise was slightly stronger, but there were no major movements. The day ended with a uniform rebound of two to three jiao to five jiao, with the total transaction volume still only 1.7 to 1.8 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:

In stock trading, 80 shares of Dasheng Third Factory stock were traded at a price of 31.5 yuan.

The public utilities stock market was extraordinarily quiet, and prices tended to soften. British American Tobacco and Woollen were the most actively traded stocks. The former closed at 31.25 yuan with buyers, while the latter gradually fell from 7.1 yuan, once seeing 6.7 yuan, but was maintained, closing at 6.85 yuan with transactions. Recently, investors and speculators have shown hesitation regarding operations, and the market situation seems to be temporarily stagnant.

London, 9th (Monday) dispatch: Today's listed market prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks: Chinese foreign debt remains stable. Far East bank stocks continue to show a positive outlook. Mercantile Bank shares rose 5 shillings to £7 15s. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation shares each rose £1, with London-registered shares at £76 and Hong Kong-registered shares at £79, with prices quoted but few transactions. Kulim Rubber shares fell 1 shilling 3 pence to 14 shillings 4.5 pence. The rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton Industry Purchase Intentions Are Strong, Yarn Market Advances, Shuangma Rises Twenty-One Yuan

Yarn Market: Firm, with the daily rise gradually increasing. At the same time, actual transactions visibly expanded. 32-count single yarn is in short supply, and selling prices are rising steadily. The price of 32-count single yarn "Celestial Maiden" has reached 1,580 yuan. Compared to the price of 20-count yarn, it is relatively cheaper, so the intention to purchase among the industry is strong. Another saying is that the biggest reason is that the recent past trend has a solid foundation, and it is gradually advancing upward. Therefore, the bullish concept is very deep. However, the sales of high-count yarns have not yet seen significant development. Today, 45 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen and 1,380 bales were shipped to Hong Kong.

Shuangma (Double Horse) opened in the morning. Because the number of each yarn count registered at the factory the previous afternoon was more than ten thousand bales, the factory could not cope with the huge number. So people's hearts were shaken. The first offer price of factory orders dragged into the market was 1,272 yuan, rising directly to 1,278 yuan. At this time, the buying momentum was very strong. Soon after, some long positions took profits, falling back to 1,266 yuan. At the price of 1,270 yuan, there were back and forth movements for a long time. Around 11 a.m., the board suddenly tightened because small brokerage firms suddenly dragged in, and the board turned brisk and sharp, rising directly to 1,281 yuan at closing. The transaction statistics for half a day totaled 4,450 bales. The price of 20-count Shuangma rose 21 yuan. The amounts bought by each group are listed as follows:

Hong Kong 940, Ningbo 50, Mainland 15, Fellow Traders 3,000, Total 4,450

The yarn market continued to be good in the afternoon, and people's hearts were enthusiastic. 20-count Shuangma has reached 1,290 yuan, a further increase of 10 yuan compared to the afternoon closing. People are unanimously looking upwards.

### After Yarn Factories Sell Off in Large Quantities, Raw Cotton Is Still Difficult to See Loosening

The situation of raw cotton is becoming firmer day by day. Because factories are selling off cotton yarn in large quantities, they must compensate for raw materials, so the price of cotton cannot be seen as loosening. Those who hold goods have an even higher desire to raise prices, and they are reluctant to unload the goods at the evening. 32-count and 42-count raw cotton are very expensive because factories have extremely high profits. Another report is on foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market is quiet and active. Subsequently, due to purchases by fellow traders and Wall Street, some are waiting for the government's acreage report to be released, so the closing price is not much different from the previous day. Indian even cotton price is estimated to have fallen more than three rupees.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton trade, although factories have opened up a portion of cotton yarn, there has been no news of replenishing a large amount of raw cotton. However, it is generally expected that the current inventory of spot goods in the market is not abundant. When factories compensate for raw cotton in the future, the price of cotton will rise.

### Piece Goods Factories Are Reluctant to Sell Cheaply

The piece goods market continued to rise yesterday. Cantonese and Zhejiang customers, as well as both internal and external major customers in this street, still had a strong appetite. Factories, due to soaring yarn prices and excessive costs, are all tending to reduce production. Therefore, they are unwilling to sell existing cloth cheaply at market prices, and the selling is even tighter. Fine cloth and bleached cloth rose 2.5 to 5 jiao per bolt. Twill coarse cloth rose 1 to 2 jiao. Yih Ho bleached cloth rose 5 to 7.5 jiao. Over 1,000 pieces of various cloths were transacted on this street. Zhejiang and Ningbo customers purchased over 200 pieces of fine cloth, colored cloth, bleached cloth, striped bleached, silk fabrics, etc. Cantonese customers purchased over 300 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and twill coarse cloth. Yantai customers from the northern route purchased over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, silk fabrics, and colored cloth. Tianjin customers purchased over 200 pieces of silk fabrics, blue cloth, etc.

The rise in Eastern cloth continued strongly. White goods, fine cloth, and fine twill continued to rise 5 to 6 jiao per bolt. The highest offer price for 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth in the after-market was 37 yuan, closing at 36.95 yuan. Mid-range cloths were even more scarce. It is said that the inventory of fine cloth is relatively thin, and the demand is increasing, forming a graceful situation. Gentlemen's serge is also purchased by many customers, rising to 1 yuan 1 jiao 2 fen 25 li.

Today, 30 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Xiamen, 525 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 9 pieces were transferred to Yangon, and 205 pieces were transferred to Singapore.

### Sugar Market Dutch Sugar Inventory Reported Reduced

The inventory of Dutch sugar at the end of last week totaled 121,498 bags, a decrease of 16,271 bags from the previous period (November 24). The distribution of each sugar is recorded below for reference, totaling 121,498 bags.

### Coarse White Slightly Rises

The grain market trended stable yesterday, and Japanese merchants imported over 2,000 bags of coarse white again. Therefore, coarse white and higher-grade refined white both saw continued rises. The association set the price for spot 24 coarse white foreign warehouse goods at 73.2 yuan, up 2 jiao. Spot Dutch red sugar remained at 56.2 jiao. Delivery on the 20th of this month was 56.4 yuan. Taikoo refined white B mark four warehouse 73.5 yuan, up 3 jiao. DY mark 69.4 yuan, HX mark 69.2 yuan, unchanged. Old goods 68.8 yuan.

### North-South Goods Black Melon Seeds Rebound

Black melon seeds rebounded in price due to the difficulty in loosening production prices and the gradual activation of sales in Shanghai. The market inventory is thin, and Jikui seeds are scarce. The current market price in Shanghai for Xukui seeds is 92-93 yuan, up 7-8 yuan, Mingguang seeds are 85 yuan, and Jiaozhou seeds are 190 yuan per dan, trending upward.

### Fennel Hong Kong Telegram Rises

Fennel has risen again following the recovery of Hong Kong telecommunications, at HK$4, which requires a Shanghai cost of 280 yuan. Therefore, the market price here has uniformly risen, and the sluggishness has been swept away.

### Miscellaneous Matches Are Rising Daily

The match market has been seeing a very healthy upward trend in the grey market for days. The inventories of various factories are gradually becoming scarce. The inland demand for goods is quite urgent. Because the procedures for moving goods out are troublesome, they cannot be shipped in whole batches. Retail sales at the shops are strong. Fellow traders are increasing their inventories, searching for purchases in the market, resulting in tight prices. For example, Beautiful Brand 297 yuan, Phoenix Brand 295 yuan, Rose Brand 250 yuan, Old Man Brand 250 yuan, and other miscellaneous brands around 240 yuan have all risen more than 20 yuan from before. People still expect prices to continue to rise (Kun).

### Coal Hailan Coal New Goods Arrive in a Rush Five Yuan Cheaper Than Last Month

Since Hailan coal was publicly sold a month ago, the spot goods on the market have been abundant. Yesterday, it was heard that a large batch of new goods had arrived at the port, and a certain company, the manager and dealer, whose warehouses were in the Shanghai West blockade line, could not store them and had to sell off at a discounted price, delivering them to various stores on this street without charging for delivery. No. 1 lumps are 225 yuan per ton, reportedly 5 yuan cheaper than last month.

### Overview of Wartime Education in Guangdong Province: Active Expansion of National Education and Secondary Education; Training Teachers and Promoting Social Education to Eradicate Illiteracy

(Shaoguan Airmail) Huang Linshu, Director of the Education Department of Guangdong Province (representing Huang Xisheng), recently reported on the overview of wartime education in Guangdong Province at the Provincial Assembly's Fourth Plenary Session. The main points are as follows:

Work Progress in National Education

Regarding national education, the core work system and implementation sequence are that each township must establish a central school, each "bao" (unit of local administration) must establish a national school, and each school must have both primary school and public education programs. The process is divided into three phases, to be completed within five years. Based on these regulations, the province has formulated a five-year implementation plan, which has been submitted to the provincial government and secondary schools for approval. This year, the province plans to establish 2,500 central schools and 9,500 national schools. The above refers to the planned aspect. The work progress is divided into five points: (1) Supervise the progress of each county and city according to the established plan; (2) Dispatch instructors to guide the work in each county; (3) Launch a national movement and compile a national movement outline. Starting from Teachers' Day on August 27th this year, all townships will hold national education movement and publicity weeks; (4) Regarding fundraising, the province allocates a portion through the provincial government, as reported by Chairman Li. The central government stipulates that the funding raised by each county should be 50%. However, this amount is not entirely issued by the county government, but is raised by the fund-raising committee.

Teacher Training is Increasingly Effective

(5) Teacher training: To establish 12,000 schools, a large number of teachers must be trained. The province has established teacher training classes in 30 counties, and has trained 8,986 teachers. The central government has always paid close attention to national education. However, this province received an order from the Ministry last month that the central government's subsidy to this province has been temporarily suspended, and next year's subsidy will be included in the 30th year's budget. As the provincial government's subsidy is 120,000 yuan, the Education Department can only re-plan within this reduced scope. This plan can be discussed in three aspects: First, increase the number of schools with the funds obtained this year; second, convert the original public primary schools in each county into central schools or national schools; third, maintain all existing private schools as they are. According to the central government's regulations, the number of public schools is still insufficient, so private schools must be maintained to make up for the shortfall. This year, at least 1,850 schools can be added, accommodating 150,000 out-of-school children and 400,000 out-of-school adults.

Active Expansion of Secondary Education

Regarding secondary education, there are 219 secondary schools in the province, with 68,165 students; 25 normal schools, with 3,701 students; 15 vocational schools, with 1,550 students; two provincial colleges and two private universities and one college for post-secondary education; and Sun Yat-sen University, a national university, with a total of 1,957 students. Regarding the facilities for secondary and higher education, there are the following points: First, all normal school students will receive public funding from this year, with the provincial government subsidizing food expenses. County-run normal school students are not allowed to charge any fees, even if public funding is not fully granted. To train teachers, on the one hand, give preferential treatment to those in service, and on the other hand, continue to cultivate those in school. Second, during the summer vacation, some schools such as the provincial agricultural vocational school, Zhongkai, Zhongshi, Central District, temporary secondary schools, Lingnan University, Guangzhou University, and National University are relocated. The remaining schools are located in Hong Kong and Macao, and the secondary schools in Guangzhou Bay also request subsidies for relocation. Third, increase the accommodation for relocated students. Most students in Hong Kong, Macao, and Guangzhou Bay are relocated inland, and Nanhua Secondary School, Wenli College, and affiliated middle schools have been ordered to increase classes to accommodate them. At the same time, the transfer procedures have also been slightly changed. Fourth, regarding the implementation of wartime education, the central government has clearly ordered that each school should continue to implement normal education as appropriate unless necessary. However, the Education Department makes expedient changes. Regarding the guidance of wartime education, there are five items: central training, including spirit, physique, academic subjects, production, labor, and rear service.

Intensifying the Promotion of Social Education

Regarding social education, a social education work team was formed last year, with ten people in each team, including propaganda, cartoons, lectures, singing, and civil education personnel, assigned to various counties to promote civil education, reaching Qingyuan, Sanshui, Huaxian, Conghua and other places. Due to the lack of artistic propaganda talents, a wartime art gallery was established. The work of eradicating illiteracy is carried out by establishing public night schools in various national schools, and other organizations and groups also establish private schools. Funding is raised by the Education Department and various counties. In addition, wartime education is set up in the occupied areas, and education and special affairs work are carried out simultaneously. In areas where the Japanese forces cannot reach, national education is promoted. Personnel undertaking this work have already set off, and it is expected that the results will be satisfactory.

### Summary by Education Director Xu: Education in Zhejiang Province in the Past Year (4)

The above eight items are only the most important ones. Most of the suggestions for improvement put forward by the counties are not complete. In the future, each county must stipulate methods for the eight items of work, improve them on a regular basis, and supervising personnel must pay attention to guidance during inspections. Those with insufficient funding should find ways to raise funds, and those with ample funding should be guided to use it.

(2) Regarding children's health, for example: (1) Physical examination - must be held regularly to understand the development and whether there are diseases; (2) General diseases - must be treated, such as trachoma, scabies, sores, etc.; (3) Simple medicines - each school must purchase; (4) Vaccination - should be carried out universally; (5) Medical common sense - must be a required subject in training so that all teachers can provide emergency treatment; (6) Children's nutrition - is currently the most serious issue, related to the health of the entire nation in the future, and should be actively promoted to arouse the attention of parents; (7) Strictly prohibit corporal punishment - to make children's mental health.

The above seven items should be implemented earnestly in each county. (3) Regarding the treatment of faculty and staff, at a time when the level of living is rising sharply and the tide of people leaving the primary school sector is raging, the "teacher shortage" is increasingly impossible to remedy. Their treatment should be actively improved to stabilize their lives. It has been found that the salaries of teachers in various counties have increased over the years, with monthly increases of two yuan, four yuan, and six yuan (such as Cixi, Huangyan, Suichang, Jiande, and Taishun), and some have increased by more than ten yuan. Other examples include national school teachers who earn around twenty yuan, and township central school teachers who earn less than thirty yuan. As for Yongkang's highest salary reaching forty-one yuan and Lishui's reaching forty yuan, these are still rare. The standards issued by the province stipulate that national school teachers are paid 18 yuan and central school teachers are paid 24 yuan, which are only the minimum limits and the standards for subsidizing expenses. The Ministry's "Standards for the Treatment of Primary School Teachers", "Measures for Annual Merit-Based Salary Increases", "Salary Distribution and Implementation Measures", "Measures for Children's Families to Provide Food and Lodging for Primary School Teachers", "Provisional Measures for Local Subsidies for Primary School Teachers' Rice", "Measures for Free Tuition for Children", "Incentive Measures", etc., will be announced and implemented soon. In the future, salary standards will be greatly increased, and each county should actively raise funds to implement them. Otherwise, no matter how many teacher training institutions there are and how many training groups are set up, it will be useless. It is hoped that the implementation of the academic rice system and the method of students taking turns providing meals can be universally implemented. (4) Finally, regarding the assessment, rewards, and punishments of teachers, it has been found that most counties have formulated methods and have implemented them. It is hoped that each county can implement them earnestly, but attention must be paid to: (1) Assessment must be fair and not be partial; (2) Rewards and punishments should be fair; (3) Supervision should be universal and detailed; (4) More active encouragement and less negative criticism should be given. (The End)

### International Cup Football Tournament: China Team to Hold Final Practice Today; Selecting Official Representatives to Prepare for the Championship

The International Cup Football Tournament is scheduled to kick off this Saturday. The China team, in order to sharpen their skills and select official representatives, will hold a final practice at 4:00 p.m. today at the Donghua Stadium at the intersection of Route LaFayette and Route Pichon. In addition to the 18 warriors who have been decided, any football players who love football and are willing to serve China may participate voluntarily and be recruited according to their talents to strengthen the team. According to the International Cup, Portugal has risen in recent years and won the championship for two consecutive sessions. In the final of the previous session, China was poisoned by the Portuguese team, which is a pity. It is hoped that the Chinese athletes will avenge their shame and win back the championship in this session. The list of Chinese names appearing today is as follows:

Qin Bigao, Zheng Tongyu, Li Ning, Zhuang Youren, Zhang Lingen, Cai Shengsen, Huang Kehou, Han Longhai, Liang Shutang, He Jiatong, Wan Jin, Zhou Qilin, Wu Binghao, Li Yichen, Dai Linjing, Sun Jinshun, Jia Youliang, Fei Chunhua.

### Big Red Invitation Cards

— Chen Qingyuan

"Hey! Boss," two or three smartly dressed friends, looking spirited, walked in, with a large stack of invitation cards in their hands: "We're inviting you for a drink!" As they said this, they handed over a big red invitation card. Sometimes the shop number was scribbled on it like crab claws; sometimes it was a blank invitation card, without the shop number; sometimes they would even borrow a pen to write your shop's signboard, and that was considered a big red invitation card to invite you for a drink.

"Brothers have to do a few things every year, and we always have to ask for your help, hehe: so that everyone doesn't look bad." After explaining and threateningly stating this, they tilted their felt hats and walked out proudly.

God knows! Not to mention that the names of the people on the invitation card are not known, they have not even been heard of, such as: Little Changshu, Yang Xiaokai, Ma Hongshen, (this name is really amazing!) Black Skin Old Second, Ah San Tou, etc. However, you can also understand what "kind" they are.

My boss has been a boss for decades and has experienced a lot of human affairs, unlike me who is young and ignorant, and always acts rashly. After receiving the invitation card, he must first inquire from the neighbors on the left and right: "Excuse me, what kind of person is Siluo Ah Da?" "Do you know Jiangbei tycoon?" If that brother has a background and evil power, he will send one or two yuan, but he never drinks alcohol; if he is an unknown soldier, he will ignore him. The boss often said in a teaching tone: "This is the only way to deal with this group of people!"

However, unless a real invitation card is sent with a gift, everything will be fine; otherwise, those who have not received a gift will come to make trouble with you.

After the "wedding day" has passed, he comes to the door, looking fierce and menacing with a murderous look on his face: "Good, no guts! Not giving any face at all? Looking down on me so much! You won't be able to walk on the road in the future, or do business?" Or: "Hey, we are all one family after all, boats rely on water, water relies on boats, ... look at my misery ..." Sometimes one person comes, sometimes two or three people come; sometimes hard, sometimes soft. As a result, most of them send him one or two yuan as a supplement, or the two sides scold each other loudly and return the invitation card; but this kind of thing is not much.

One day, a small rogue sent an invitation card, but he also wanted to write a receipt. What? Sending an invitation card requires a receipt? Even the boss was shocked by this. The rogue leisurely took out the invitation card, sent it to the boss, and sneered:

"Old Soft-shelled Turtle, wipe your eyes bright! Zhang ××, do you know him? He has three or five thousand apprentices, and his power covers the entire 'Shanghai'. When he sends an invitation card, people can't wait to send it; whether you send it or not is up to you. Just knock a receipt on it so I can explain it. - If you don't send it, see how you 'behave'!" After the boss inquired, it was indeed a "tycoon", so he had to send a gift again. It is pitiful that so many small businessmen with meager profits are exploited like this!

There are surprisingly many invitation cards! On average, there is at least one every day, each with its own excuse and its own sphere of influence. The best reasons for sending invitation cards are the father's birthday, the mother's death anniversary, the child's full moon, and the child's first birthday. I have been here for not long, and the invitation cards have already filled a drawer, and every dog's stove cannot use them all.

Writing here, a friend asked me: "Haha, you guys are really fools, don't you have police there?" Alas! We really don't have police here, most of them are unarmed "rice buckets".

Friend, I forgot to tell you that this place of ours is the "evil land" of the total pool of "heroes and good men"!

### Unfilial Orphan

— Dai Niao

"Poor people have big bellies", not only do men who sell their strength need to eat four big bowls of rice per meal, but unfortunately, there is a sallow-faced woman who also has a belly that is so high once a year. Isn't it true that the bamboo poles of sampan boats are full of children's clothes that are mostly hung up and torn? Aren't there groups of naked children like cranes and ducks in the straw sheds of the slums?

Two big bellies give birth to groups of small bellies, but the land is not German, so naturally they can only look and sigh. However, waste can still be used, and this group of small bellies are finally called people. If a puppy is lost, you have to post an advertisement, isn't "selling children" a matter of course?

"Buying children!" shouted in the alley.

To "make a deal", both parties must agree. When a sugar vendor comes, buyers arrive immediately, but selling children is different: "What are you pretending for?" "I ran into him in ×× the day before yesterday. Call the police and drive him out!"

This is because the ground in Shanghai is too bad, and no one is willing to believe that parents actually sell their own flesh and blood!

However, the rich and powerful who have no "next generation" are also burning incense and kowtowing everywhere. The master shakes in and out every day with a big belly, but the wife's belly is always shriveled. At this time, she can't help but envy the Jiangbei men on the sampan boat. After envy, the master had a flash of inspiration, not "buying" but self-made", building a room and hiding a beauty. It is also strange that God grants people's wishes, and in more than half a year, a soup cake banquet is held.

After the concubine's belly is bigger, the big wife can only curse her own belly for being unpromising and not wanting to eat any vinegar? - There are three unfilial acts, and having no descendants is the greatest has already shut up. But troubles are still inevitable. Once the master gives up the ghost, the advertisement of "unfilial orphan" is the prelude to the "inheritance lawsuit".

### Amitabha!

— Fei Zuohua

### Zhang Yiliu

— Gu Mingdao

The strong man smiled again and said: "Your beautiful name, from the famous officials and dignitaries to the vendors, who doesn't know it? Who doesn't admire it? The day before yesterday, my companion and I were walking on the street, and we saw the girl passing by in a car, and the people on the roadside praised her. Therefore, I already know your beautiful face, please forgive my presumption." The beautiful woman heard the strong man speak frankly and refreshingly without losing politeness, and must be a hero from the grass, and must not be despised because he is begging. What kind of person is she herself, with the same feeling of being reduced to the end of the world? So she smiled slightly and said: "So that's how it is. Since the strong man wants to drink, there are many aged wines in our boat, and we will definitely provide the strong man with a drunk." The strong man thanked him, and then bowed to the Confucian student and said: "Is this Zhang Xianggong? May I ask your name." The Confucian student hurriedly bowed and said: "I dare not. My humble name is Tianru." The strong man bowed deeply again and said: "Zhang Tianru Xianggong is an old celebrity of the Fushe Society, and I admire him very much. Today, I accidentally met celebrities and beauties here, which can be said to be destined." Zhang Tianru and the beautiful woman felt a shock in their hearts when they heard it. Jiang Zifu smiled slightly beside him and said: "Celebrities, beauties, hey! I heard this again, where is the hero?" Zhang Tianru had already estimated that the strong man must be an extraordinary person, and hurriedly invited him to sit in the middle cabin. He ordered Xu Da Niang and others to quickly warm up a large pot of Lihua Spring fine wine, and then cook two delicious dishes for the strong man to enjoy. The boatman was like a tofu boat hitting a stone boat. After suffering a loss, he was very angry in his heart. Xu Da Niang saw that her adopted daughter and Zhang Tianru and others were actively entertaining a beggar from the Jianghu. Everyone was half surprised and half annoyed in their hearts. But with Zhang Tianru ordering, they dared not disobey. Zhang Tianru and the Liu sisters accompanied the strong man to sit down together. The strong man sat on a brocade stool, and there happened to be a mirror in front of him, which reflected his ragged state. He smiled slightly and said: "Today, a beggar is sitting in a painted boat, isn't it inappropriate?" The beautiful woman said: "I recently heard that there is an iron beggar in the city, could it be you, strong man?" The strong man nodded, stroked his beard, and said: "I am the iron beggar that people call, I don't know why everyone calls me this name?" Zhang Tianru smiled and said: "The iron beggar is a tough guy, which shows a glimpse of the strong man's personality." At this time, the boat was already alongside the bank, and the wine and dishes had also been brought up. The strong man said a word of disturbance and immediately poured wine and drank heartily. The beautiful woman also asked the strong man and said: "May I ask the strong man's name, please tell me." The strong man said: "My surname is Shi, and my single name is Da. As for my background, I am really ashamed to tell you, so let me drink." "Are you going anywhere?" Zhang Tianru said: "I accompanied the two Liu girls and originally wanted to visit Jingyuan, but I didn't expect to meet the strong man Shi by chance on the boat." (6)

### Suffered from Being "Honest"

— Su Nong

In the morning, when I opened the newspaper, the first thing I "patronized" was always the advertisements in the recruitment column. Today was no exception; when the words "trainee" jumped into my eyes, I didn't care about having breakfast and ran to the ×× company with the newspaper in one breath.

I asked myself if the time was not too late, but the "temporary interview place" in the company was already crowded with people. There was no other way, so I used a non-smiling "crying face" to attack the crowd. The people behind seemed to be very "sensible", knowing that it would take at least a few hours to wait for their turn, why not give a "convenient five"? Therefore, I quickly passed the "anti-money"; the front was not so easy: with both hands propping up and buttocks sticking out, fearing that you would squeeze past and steal his "rice bowl", he frequently cast white eyes from time to time. So I thought that this "Maginot" was unbreakable, and I knew my foot, so I stood still.

One of the big guys finished the "procedures" (it didn't look very proud). Turn around! This place hurriedly gave way to an aisle", just like "a knife cutting water", breaking and closing! To try to get half a step forward is like "the difficulty of Shu Road"!

In this way, the "giving way show" was staged every two or three minutes. Hundreds of eyes sent away the dejected "losers" one by one. So the middle one got to the front, and the one who was originally in the back could see the "trial" inside from under other people's ears.

It was past twelve o'clock, and I felt that I had already stood on the "front line". The "judge" with gold-rimmed glasses on his nose nodded slightly at me (the big thing was that he told me to go in without opening his mouth.) Suddenly my face turned red and my body trembled, like a mouse seeing a cat. But, I finally mustered up the courage and "pounced" straight inside! (The back was pushing!)

The "judge" first looked at me from my hair to my toes, and then asked as if he didn't bother to ask

"How old?"

"Twenty in four days." At this time, the judge looked at a chair next to me, and I thought it was warning me: "Don't sit". I subconsciously moved a little further away. The "judge" frowned, and my heart jumped.

"Where did you graduate?"

"One year short of high school." This is the truth

"Alone in Shanghai?"

"No! There are many people in my family; both parents are alive; and -"

"Hey! You are too honest! You are not suitable for this place..." After he "judged", he went to greet another guy who was squinting. He glanced at me and looked like he was very "slippery" and talked big. I guess he can always be hired, right?

So, I also passed the "corridor", and there were dozens of eyes that sent me away; I also changed to a "smiling face" that was similar to crying...

When I came home, I had already eaten; I held the cold rice and stuffed it into my stomach", I was so hungry!

### "Young Edison" Essay Contest - Parents' Section, Three Winners

— Mei Jinliang, Li Jingde

After seeing "Young Edison," looking at our three apple-cheeked children, we felt honored and also solemn. The only thought floating in our minds was: These children are a sacred trust, not our private property.

We have a responsibility and a mission towards our children—a sacred responsibility and mission. How can we fulfill this sacred responsibility? How can we live up to this sacred mission? This serious question still revolves in our minds.

We have three children full of life, like three seeds planted in our garden. They contain infinite possibilities. We can cultivate them diligently, water them carefully, let them be nourished by sunshine and dew, and protect them from the ravages of wind and waves—like Edison's mother did. In time, they will grow strong branches and leaves, bloom brilliant flowers, and bear delicious fruits, providing shade in the desert, beauty on the path of life, and food on the line of hunger. People will be grateful and point to them saying: This is Edison, this is Sun Yat-sen, this is Pasteur—and we have the hope of being their parents. Isn't this an honor?

But, conversely, we could also, through laziness, lack of understanding, or cowardice and meanness, lightly let go of such golden opportunities, causing these excellent seeds to, because they cannot get fertilizer, are smoked by polluted air, or bitten by wild animals and pests, become withered and distorted monsters that neither blossom nor bear fruit, simply occupying land on the road, hindering people's paths, and being trampled on. And their parents, that is us, will have buried the good Edison, Sun Yat-sen, and Pasteur forever! Thinking this way, we feel fear, we feel solemn!

After repeatedly considering the story of young Edison and our responsibilities, we feel that there are three relatively important concepts—or rather, three aspirations—that are worth writing about:

First, we acknowledge that being parents is a specialized job that requires specialized skills and knowledge. We must study subjects like child psychology and physiology to more deeply understand the factors influencing children's thoughts and behaviors, so that, like Edison's mother, we can recognize our children’s individual personalities and see the treasures in them that others cannot see. It is not enough to simply be loving parents—which parent is not loving? We must add intelligence and reason to our love!

Second, in teaching our children, we must avoid commonly used prohibitions and raised-hand scoldings, and instead adopt methods of positive guidance and encouragement. We must seek out and develop the strengths in our children's personalities and use them to cover up their weaknesses.

Third, we must respect our children's feelings and treat them as "people," with compassion. The biggest reason why there could still be a great Edison after young Edison is that his mother could still trust him when everyone else despised him. Because young Edison did not want to betray his mother's trust, he refused to give up on himself, and thus became the great Edison.

Truly, being parents is an unparalleled honor, an unparalleled opportunity, and an unparalleled responsibility. We believe that there is a Chinese Edison in our home. Every parent can have this belief, as long as they are willing. In this dark era, we hope that many parents will unite, explore and research together, how to shoulder this unparalleled responsibility, and how to realize their highest beliefs. We especially hope that more leaders in society will rise up to advocate and expand this movement, because children are a sacred trust, not an individual's private property.

Two "New" Plays

### Mao Yu, Wu Chengyong, et al. Perform "Rising Moon"; "Russian Drama Troupe" Rehearses Cao Yu's "Thunderstorm"

— Liang Hao

Recently, there will be two "new" plays staged, both of which should be seen as soon as possible. The so-called "new" plays are not plays that are being performed for the first time (on the contrary, they are "old" plays), but they are "new" plays.

The first one is "Rising Moon." All the actors are people we know, but none of them have been on stage before. This is what makes it "new." Their names are: Mao Yu, Wu Chengxiu, Chen Mingxun, Shen Hong, Mu Shilong, etc. The director is Miss Sai Jinhua Yingyin. It will be performed at Lafayette Road on the 14th.

The second is the Russian Émigré Drama Troupe's rehearsal of Cao Yu's "Thunderstorm." It will be performed at the Municipal Council Hall on Huanlong Road starting on the 17th. Their script is translated from Yao Ke's English translation published in "T'ien Hsia Monthly," and Yao Ke has been invited to help with the rehearsal. Can a play with "all Chinese costumes, Chinese props, Chinese sets, and Russian dialogue" not be called a "new" play?

### Watching Ye Shengzhang's "Running the Donkey" and Discussing Northern-Style "Old Master" Plays

— Sha Lei

The Fu Liancheng Society is performing at the Golden Theater. I have seen Ye Shengzhang's "Lianhuan" and "Copper Mesh Formation" one after another, and have briefly described his artistic skills in this publication. Recently, Shengzhang injured his wrist while practicing his skills, so these days he is changing to performing the Jiang Gan in "Stealing the Book of Alliance" and the Chong Gongdao in "Su San's Departure," both of which are comic roles. It seems that his private plays such as "Buddha's Hand Orange Stealing Silver Kettle," "Drunk Beggar," and "Zhihua Stealing the Crown" will have to be postponed for a while!

On the evening of the 9th, Ye Shengzhang performed "Running the Donkey." This is a play that is not seen in the South, so I went to see it once. At the same time, I also saw Ye Shenglan and Ye Shichang's "Champion's Score" and "Linjiang Meeting," which have quite a few noteworthy aspects, and I will now record them as follows:

In "Champion's Score," Ye Shichang plays Chen Boyu, and several segments of the original tune are sung very steadily. The shaking board turning to crying in "The official speaks sad words" emphasizes the melody of the wheat cool very well. Ye Shenglan plays Chen Daguan. The poor scholar must not lose his scholarly air in his poverty, and Shenglan is quite able to do this. The hanging hair when visiting his uncle's grave shows that he is never perfunctory in his acting, and is also worthy of praise.

The headlining "Running the Donkey" is taken from the "Private Meeting in the Study" section of the "Xia Jian Ji" legend. It tells the love story of Li Yulang and the prostitute Zhang Lirong. Because there is a section where Zhang Lirong rides a donkey to visit Li Yulang, the play is called "Running the Donkey." Ye Shengzhang plays a helper in a brothel, which in the North is called "捞毛" [lāo máo, lit. "scooping hair"]. The whole play focuses on jokes and ad-libs. It is purely a farce, and the jokes are quite abundant. Ye Shengzhang completely uses Northern slang and the pronunciation of this person is very similar, but it is not easy for Southerners to understand, so they cannot appreciate its goodness. However, it feels like the performance is quite funny.

The main "Linjiang Meeting" is roughly similar to the plot of "Yellow Crane Tower," but the general who protects Liu Huangshu is changed from General Zhao Yun to the Second Marquis Guan Yu. Ye Shenglan's Zhou Yu steps out his boots, and grasping the pheasant tail has extremely beautiful movements, all of which are Sheng's strengths. Ye Shichang's Zhuge Liang only has a few shaking boards, and is only in a supporting role in the play, but the expression of stealing a glance outside the tent and laughing is very good. In addition, it was my first time seeing a painted-face performing an old master play, and that was Ye Shengmao's Guan Yu. It is said that when Liu Lianrong came to Shanghai before, he also performed Guan Yu in "Linjiang Meeting" at the Golden Theater. Probably in the North, because of the lack of red-faced talents, it is a common thing for painted-faces to also play old master roles, but it is rare in the South. Ye Shengmao's old master wears black boots, which is also different from the South. In the South, Guan Lao usually has a special tiger boot. When crossing the river, Guan Yu wears a black overcoat, which looks very strange. It seems that wearing a "kaichang" [overshirt] would be better. In terms of acting skills, because Shengmao is a painted-face, he is dignified and majestic, which is very suitable for the character's identity. Li Shilin plays Liu Bei, and when he sees Zhou Yu, he mistakenly says "newly appointed commander" as "body appointed commander." Wearing a commander's seal on his body, is he not afraid that Zhou Gongjin will find it cumbersome? He must correct it later!
