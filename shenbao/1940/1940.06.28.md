Rome. According to a Bucharest dispatch from the official Stefani News Agency, Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov has delivered an ultimatum to Romania, demanding the immediate return of Bessarabia and the northern region of Bukovina bordering Poland, and giving Romania until tonight to respond. (United Press, June 27th)

Bucharest. Authoritative sources this afternoon say Romania has decided to accept the Soviet demands. The Soviet Union delivered an ultimatum demanding the return of Bessarabia and the northern part of the Bukovina province, and control of the ports of Constanta and Tulcea, with a deadline of 10 PM tonight for a response. (Associated Press, June 27th)

Berlin. A German government spokesperson stated that Germany's attitude towards Romania is the same as its attitude towards the Baltic states: Germany will neither offer advice nor participate in any arbitration. (Associated Press, June 27th)

Berlin. The land demanded by the Soviet Union from Romania has a population of three million people and covers 4,030 square miles. In 1934, Romania guaranteed the integrity of the Soviet Union's western border territories, and the Soviet Union ceased demanding the return of Bessarabia and Bukovina. (Associated Press, June 27th)

London. The Italian news agency published news from the Romanian capital, stating that the Soviet government has demanded that the Romanian government return Bessarabia and northern Bukovina. This news has not yet been officially confirmed. It stated that Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov invited the Romanian ambassador for talks yesterday and made this request, giving them until tonight to respond. Soviet aircraft are now flying over Romanian territory, causing great shock in Romanian political circles. The official German news agency also published this news received from the Romanian capital, stating that the ultimatum expires at 10 PM today. The agency also published news from the Hungarian capital, stating that the Romanian Crown Council has reportedly decided to accept the demands. (Reuters, June 27th)

Bucharest. Romanian King Carol convened a Crown Council this afternoon, but the content of the discussion is unclear. Political figures speculate that the discussion concerns extremely important issues. (Haitong Telegraph, June 27th)

Bucharest. Romanian government authorities notified Romanian Airlines last night that all air services passing through eastern Romania must be suspended. It is rumored that the government's motive is related to military affairs, as there are many fortresses on Romania's eastern border, and aircraft passing through would hinder the maintenance of military secrets. (Haitong Telegraph, June 27th)

Berlin. Authoritative sources here recently stated that well-informed sources in Bucharest say the Soviet Union has delivered an ultimatum to Romania, but the Romanian government refuses to confirm this news. News from Bucharest arriving in Berlin today says the Soviet Union demands the return of Bessarabia, a rich oil-producing region, which was Russian territory before 1919. It is also rumored that the Soviet Union demands the return of the northern part of Bukovina, a former Austrian province. (Associated Press, June 27th)

### German-Soviet Border Treaty Negotiations Begin; Soviet Representative Arrives in Berlin

Berlin. Alexander Livshitz, Director of the Western European Department of the Soviet Foreign Commissariat, along with Colonel Lyutikov, arrived in Berlin yesterday to begin negotiations on the German-Soviet border treaty. Those welcoming them at the station included Minister Su Geng, Counselor Schlieper of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Soviet Ambassador to Germany Shkvartsev, among others. (Haitong News Agency, June 27th)

### United States Simultaneously Attends to Situations in Europe and Asia; Most Warships Still Remain in Hawaii

Philadelphia. According to well-informed American sources, it is difficult to say whether Washington is more concerned about the situation in Europe or the Far East. Currently, there is not much news available from the State Department and the White House, but it is understood that both places attach great importance to both regions. Non-official circles are comparing Japan's actions and threats of continued action with Mussolini's actions, which he believes can be safely carried out. If Japan overturns the status quo in the Pacific, it is difficult to predict what the United States will do. The deployment of the U.S. Pacific Fleet remains shrouded in mystery both here and in Honolulu. Although some warships have sailed towards the Panama Canal, it is generally believed that most warships will remain in Hawaiian waters or points east. According to political observers, most people believe that the U.S. fleet has been stationed in the central Pacific for so long to prepare for the possibility of the situation that is currently unfolding. American attention is multifaceted, including the possibility of huge losses in trade with China, maintaining the independence of the Philippines, maintaining the supply of rubber, tin, and tungsten from the Far East, and America's general condemnation of aggression and refusal to recognize territorial changes caused by force. Some political observers believe that if the government does not gradually become completely isolationist (there is no indication of this at present), then if the threats implied in General Toshiroku's declaration are carried out, American action is almost inevitable. The Republican Convention's complete disregard for reality is evident in the party platform, which ignores even the situation that seriously threatens American interests and the American defense program, in which rubber plays an important role. (Reuters, June 27th)

New York. American newspapers are speculating about the secret whereabouts of the U.S. fleet after it departed from the Hawaiian Islands. It is generally believed that the fleet is heading towards the Panama Canal, and it will take at least ten days to arrive. Because the gun emplacements along the American coast have been strengthened, and there are rumors that minefields have been laid at both entrances to the Panama Canal, the subtle clues are thought-provoking. Some believe that if the U.S. fleet sails to the Atlantic, President Roosevelt may have the idea of ​​occupying French colonies in South America and the West Indies, or have the intention of seizing Dakar from Germany, because if Germany and Italy can control the French navy, the naval strength of the Axis powers will be greatly enhanced. (Haitong Telegraph, June 27th)

### British Troops Continue Activities on Libyan Border; Italian Airfield in Africa Attacked

Cairo. General Headquarters issued an "unofficial" statement stating that yesterday, British patrols in front of Libya continued their activities in the coastal areas of Sidi Aziz and Bardia, and south to the grassy savanna of Qarah Babr. The Qarah Babr British patrol advanced northwest along the desert road leading to the coastal area. It is now confirmed that Italian aircraft bombed the Mosamma Matruh area on Sunday. No British troops were injured, but three Egyptian soldiers were killed and eighteen wounded. A steel and concrete air-raid shelter was hit by a bomb within six feet, but the shelter was unaffected. (Reuters, June 27th)

Cairo. An official bulletin announced that yesterday morning, British Air Force bombers raided Italian airfields and military targets in Africa, with great effect. British aircraft attacked and heavily damaged Italian aircraft hangars. When the British aircraft were returning after completing their mission, they engaged in combat with enemy fighters for thirty minutes, resulting in the shooting down of one enemy aircraft, and another seemed to have lost control. All British aircraft returned safely to their base. In addition, British Blenheim aircraft bombed the Magaca airfield and gasoline depots, hitting several bombs, but the extent of the damage is unknown. Military targets in Asaba were also attacked by British aircraft. Yesterday, Malta was bombed by enemy aircraft five times, resulting in several Indian casualties and very minor damage. British aircraft flew into enemy territory for reconnaissance and obtained valuable photographs. All British aircraft returned safely. (Reuters, June 27th)

### Duke of Windsor Leaves Madrid

Madrid. The Duke of Windsor and his entourage drove towards Portugal by car yesterday morning. It is said that Windsor requested to stay in Spain for three more days, but was refused by the Spanish authorities. (Haitong Telegraph, June 27th)

### British Military Strength is Strong and Victory is Assured; Broadcast Speech by Secretary of War Eden

London. Secretary of War Eden broadcast last night expressing his complete conviction that Britain would be able to repel German attacks, stating in brief: Germany has already destroyed the free fortresses around Britain and will soon attack our land. Enemy air raids will continue, and the enemy may use other methods of attack, but they will be repelled, and we will also make the enemy frequently suffer aerial counterattacks within their own territory. We know well that our countrymen will never retreat. From the tragic fate of France, we have learned that civilization cannot be preserved by material methods alone. Steel and concrete bunkers are not enough; only by mobilizing the spirit and will of the entire nation can we achieve final victory. At this time of danger, the fiber of our national organization will be put to a difficult test, but we also know in our hearts that there is a rare and great opportunity today: the British Empire now has the opportunity to independently defend, restore, and expand the scope of freedom in the future. Troops from all parts of the British Empire are now gathered in Britain. This is an amazing sight of the people of the Empire united for justice. The French nation, in its painful groaning, only hopes that we will preserve its precious civilization. If we and our overseas compatriots do not express our firm and unyielding will to preserve civilization, then this civilization will inevitably disappear from Europe. All those who are trampled under the enemy's iron heel are looking to our victory. How can we disappoint them? Eden strongly urged the people of the country not to panic each other when attacked, saying that the defeat of France was facilitated by the gathering of refugees. We British should take this as a warning. The enemy will soon know that sitting still and being bombed without resisting is not the nature of the British. We have an extremely strong air force that will inflict heavy damage on the enemy. Although our air force is fighting in unfavorable circumstances, it is still inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Our air force often fights outnumbered. When the British army retreated from Dunkirk, our air force shot down as many as seventy enemy aircraft in one day. The combat of our air force in our own skies should be even better. If enemy aircraft occasionally sneak into British airspace and our aircraft do not engage them, then the people of the country should not angrily ask what our air force is doing. It must be known that our air force is repelling enemy aircraft a hundred miles away and protecting the factories, docks, ships, and airfields on which our national defense depends from damage. We now have a large number of aircraft, and the number is increasing daily, but we must use them where they can destroy the enemy most. The anti-aircraft guns placed all over our country and the barrage balloons that captured two enemy aircraft the night before are also things that our countrymen should not forget. I am not saying that the people of the country will not be bombed, but I can tell the people of the country that the fate of enemy aircraft is not enviable. We are now a fortress, but in the British Isles, it is useless to only be able to repel attacks. There are now 1.25 million soldiers in our country holding spears, and the arrival of new troops from Australia and New Zealand, and the return of British and Allied forces from France, have greatly increased our country's military strength to an unprecedented level. We firmly believe that we will be able to defeat any enemy troops attempting to land in Britain with sufficient troops. Tonight I speak with limited optimism. I know that we must face difficult days, but I also know that our abilities and spirit are sufficient to cope with any difficulties. Only adopting a defensive posture or counterattacking will never win the victory. There will be a day when we will attack the enemy, and at that time our countrymen will see us do it with all our strength. At present, we are already attacking and winning elsewhere. Our army in the Near East has been quite active with this spirit of attack. This is a good omen for the future. (Reuters, June 27th)

Editorial

### What Will Become of the French Navy?

The armistice agreements between Germany and France, and between Italy and France, have been signed and established by both parties, have been officially announced, and are being implemented. The so-called Western Front war has come to an end. If the European war situation develops along the original straight line, then future battles will be, on the one hand, the German army's offensive against Britain; on the other hand, the war between Britain and Italy in the Mediterranean and Africa. We do not need to predict how the Second World War will be won or lost, but before deciding the outcome, there is an extremely important and very interesting issue that is currently difficult to understand but will be revealed soon, namely, what will become of the French Navy?

What do we mean by "what will become of"? If the French Navy follows the orders of the Petain government in Bordeaux, that is, in accordance with Article 8 of the German-French armistice agreement: "The French Navy, except for a small number protecting colonies overseas, should gather in designated ports and be disarmed under German and Italian supervision; Germany solemnly guarantees that, except for coastal defense and minesweeping, the French Navy will never be used for combat activities; therefore, France should recall all overseas warships except those maintaining the colonial empire." Also in accordance with Article 12 of the Italian-French armistice agreement: "The French naval fleet, except those permitted by the German and Italian governments to protect French colonies overseas, should gather in designated ports and be disarmed under German and Italian supervision; therefore, all French fleets overseas, except those maintaining colonial interests, should be recalled; the Italian government declares that it has no intention of using the French Navy in combat during the war; it also has no demands on the French Navy after the peace agreement; but during the armistice period, the Italian government reserves the right to use the French fleet to carry out minesweeping work." This is one attitude the French Navy could take. Another attitude the French Navy could take is, regardless of whether the so-called French Provisional National Committee in London is formed or not, to remain on the same battle line with the British fleet and continue to fight against Germany and Italy.

Originally, the French Navy ranked fourth in the world. Germany and Italy are no match for France, outside of Britain, the United States, and Japan. Let's make a simple table for comparison:

Country Number of Ships Tonnage

Britain 301 1,307,083

France 176 520,732

Italy 218 428,921

Germany 65 135,257

The strength of naval power can be assessed from various different points of view; the amount of tonnage is not the only criterion, but for a general comparison, it is acceptable to use tonnage as a measure. According to the tonnage listed in the table on the right, if Britain and France are added together to resist Germany and Italy, then Britain and France are three times stronger, which is an absolute advantage. If the French fleet allies with Germany and Italy to resist Britain, then Britain is only slightly stronger in comparison, but British warships still have to be reserved for the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and the Far East, and cannot all fight in the Atlantic and Mediterranean; so Britain not only cannot grasp the advantage, but it can even be said to be comparatively inferior. Therefore, solely in terms of European naval power, the French Navy occupies a pivotal position. Since Germany's victory in land warfare and France's submission, wouldn't Germany and Italy want to take the French Navy for their own use in order to fight against Britain? However, Article 8 of the German-French armistice agreement guarantees that the French Navy will not be used for combat; Article 12 of the Italian-French armistice agreement, in addition to declaring that the French Navy will not be used for combat, further declares that there will be no demands on the French Navy when concluding a peace treaty in the future. What is the reason for this? Is it because the strength of the French Navy is not worth mentioning? Is it because of benevolence and morality? Neither is the case. Germany and Italy clearly know that the German and Italian navies are no match for Britain, but Germany is confident in its air force and army, and Italy is also quite proud of its air force, believing that this is enough to control Britain. If they could drive and command the French Navy, it would naturally be great; but they also know that the French Navy may not be willing to fight, or if they are willing to fight, they will definitely side with Britain, and will not be happy to obey Germany and Italy and resist Britain. Therefore, what is guaranteed and declared in the armistice agreement is by no means a military view, but a political strategy; the guarantee and the declaration are only to avoid the lesson of chasing fish in the deep sea and chasing birds in the forest, promising to preserve it, and not driving it for the use of Britain.

So, what will become of the French Navy? The answer is not far off, and we cannot know it now. But its impact is directly related to the German army's offensive against Britain, and the British-Italian war in the Mediterranean; it is indirectly related to the status of the French Bordeaux government in relation to the victorious country, and the status of the National Committee in relation to the various French colonies. Extending even further, it is also implicitly an important factor in the evolution of the international situation in the future. Yesterday, a telegram reported that the French Governor-General of Vietnam described the strength of the combined British-French fleet in the Far East; yesterday, it was also reported that the Bordeaux government had dismissed the Governor of Vietnam; even these two pieces of news, although there is no way to know the details, can reveal that the implications are far-reaching and the situation is subtle. Then, is it not extremely noteworthy what will become of the French Navy?

### Over a Hundred Japanese Planes Bomb Chongqing School District; Part of National Central University Destroyed; One Japanese Plane Shot Down

Chongqing: Around noon today, over a hundred Japanese bombers, divided into three groups, bombed the western suburbs of Chongqing. Fires broke out in several places outside the city, but no bombs fell within the city. According to Chinese sources, three Japanese planes were shot down by anti-aircraft fire during yesterday's air raid. (Reuters, 27th)

Chongqing: When the third wave of Japanese planes attacked Chongqing today, they dropped dozens of explosive bombs in the Shapingba school district. Several dozen buildings, including laboratories, factories, and faculty residences of National Central University, were destroyed. Fortunately, it is during the summer vacation, and the school had already taken emergency measures, so there were no casualties among teachers and students. However, the situation for the faculty members whose homes were bombed is said to be very difficult. (27th)

Chongqing: Three squadrons of Japanese planes again raided the western suburbs of Chongqing this morning. Many bombs fell on both banks of the Jialing River, immediately causing several large fires. However, the city area was not bombed. Several large bombs fell near the "Jialing Apartments," where foreign reporters reside. In addition, several private residences and a large number of thatched sheds were destroyed along the Chengdu-Chongqing highway. According to recent days of Japanese bombing, although the number of casualties is not very high, thousands of people have been left homeless, mostly the poor. From a military point of view, this kind of Japanese air raid has virtually no effect. This kind of terror bombing will never demoralize the people. On the contrary, the people of Chongqing, seeing that the Japanese planes come every day, have become accustomed to it. (Havas, 27th)

Chongqing: Three large squadrons of Japanese planes, each with fifty-four planes, totaling one hundred and sixty-two planes, intruded into the skies over Chongqing again at 11:30 AM today, indiscriminately bombing and dropping hundreds of bombs. Five hundred civilians were killed or wounded. From the confluence of the Jialing and Yangtze Rivers to Jialing Village, almost no place was spared. Hundreds of shops and houses were destroyed, with rubble and ruins everywhere. Bombs fell near the French and Soviet embassies, shaking the buildings and sending tiles flying. A bomb also fell in front of the Jialing Apartments (where foreign journalists reside after the Chongqing Hotel was bombed), almost destroying it. In addition, Dongchuan Middle School, the Canadian Church Hospital, and the YMCA dormitory were all bombed. Considering the wide scope of this Japanese bombing, the fact that only about 500 people were killed or wounded is not considered many. It is generally believed that this is due to the effective air defense of the Chinese government and the carefulness of the residents. Four Japanese planes were shot down by Chinese fighter planes in this battle. As soon as the Japanese planes had not yet escaped, Chinese rescue teams rushed to provide aid. Workers swept the streets and removed corpses. By the time the authorities lifted the air raid alert, the people had emerged from the air raid shelters, and everything had returned to normal in an instant. (Havas, 26th)

Chongqing: Chongqing was again bombed by Japanese planes yesterday. Several bombs fell near the German Embassy and in the residential area near the Soviet Embassy. The so-called safe zone on the south bank of the Yangtze River was also hit by several bombs. (Haitong, 27th)

Chongqing: One hundred and twenty Japanese planes again fiercely bombed Chongqing in four waves yesterday, including the city area. The German and Soviet embassies and the Canadian Church Hospital were all destroyed. The printing press and editorial department of the Ta Kung Pao were also destroyed, but the newspaper continued to publish as usual. Other places hit include the YMCA cinema, a Buddhist temple, and the New Sichuan Opera House. Two bombs fell near the American Embassy, causing no damage. According to Chinese sources, three Japanese planes were shot down. (Reuters, 27th)

Chongqing: Japanese planes have suffered heavy losses in their continuous attacks on Chongqing. On the 27th, the Japanese again gathered over ninety planes and attacked in waves, hiding in the high clouds to avoid attacks by the Chinese air force and anti-aircraft units. The Chinese air force had already seen through their plan and formed a net to intercept them in the high sky. When the Japanese planes flew into the Chinese encirclement, several Japanese planes were damaged and retreated south in disarray. The Chinese air force bravely pursued them to the skies over Nanchuan. One Japanese plane was shot down by the Chinese and burned in northern Nanchuan. The Chinese air force safely returned to base at 1:00 PM. (27th)

After fierce fighting until yesterday morning, the Japanese suffered even more casualties, and the Chinese continued to inflict heavy losses. (27th)

### Chinese Army in Shandong Captures Zhaoxian

Tianjin: According to news from Qingdao, Zhaoyuan, located in the northwestern corner of the Shandong Peninsula, has been captured by the Chinese army. The Japanese army suffered heavy losses during their retreat. It is now reported that the Chinese army is advancing along the highway towards Longkou and Laiyang. (Express News Agency, 27th)

### Japanese Troops in Anbei Surrounded

Western Sui: A unit of Japanese troops in Anbei attempted to invade Gaotailiang on the 21st.

### Britain Urges French Fleet to Sail to Free Military Ports; Germany Claims British Landing Force Repulsed; French Government Prepares to Move from Bordeaux

London: The British government last night urged all commanders of the French fleet to sail their fleets to British or French free military ports to help defend French territory. This appeal was broadcast in French via wireless and by the BBC. The British appeal, titled "Important Message to French Fleet Officers," stated that the armistice agreement in Compiegne was intended to preserve French territory, but this has not been achieved, and Indochina is now threatened. The land rich in natural resources and not controlled by the Germans is the core of French resistance and should be the focus of French sailors, which is their duty. Prepare quickly to defend this great French empire and immediately sail the fleet to free military ports, whether they belong to France or the Allies. (Associated Press, 27th)

London: According to sources, the French government plans to move from the port of Bordeaux to the city of Clermont-Ferrand. (Havas, 26th)

Berlin: The responsible authorities here announced last night that several British warships attempted to make small-scale landings at two locations on the French coast yesterday but were repulsed by German forces. Only two German soldiers were injured. British propaganda about "Allied naval, land, and air forces landing in enemy coastal areas" is completely exaggerated. (Haitong, 27th)

Gibraltar: According to reliable sources, French warships and government offices in Casablanca, Morocco, are now flying flags at half-mast. All French residents in the area have declared to the Moroccan High Commissioner their determination to continue the war alongside Britain. Former French Prime Minister Daladier is reportedly under arrest in Casablanca. (Reuters, 27th)

### French Government Appoints Representatives to Armistice Commission

Geneva: The French cabinet today appointed representatives to the French armistice commissions stationed in Germany and Italy. The delegation to Germany is headed by General Huntziger, followed by Admiral Michelier, responsible for naval matters, and General Houssais, responsible for air force matters. The others are Bianquis, governor of several departments; Allix, an auditor from the Ministry of Finance; Parodi, the general manager of labor and trade; Bersillon, an associate of the French railway company; and Recape, an industrialist. The delegation to Italy is headed by Admiral Duplat, followed by General Parisot, responsible for army matters, and General Vaudier, responsible for air force matters. The others are Norch, governor of the Basses-Alpes department; Contenil, an auditor from the Ministry of Finance; Comte, a senator; Canton, the director of the Port of Marseille; and Garnier, a counselor at the embassy. (Haitong, 24th)

### British Forces Launch Raids Across the Sea, Demonstrating Offensive Spirit

London: An Information Ministry communiqué stated that British naval, land, and air forces, in cooperation with the Royal Air Force, conducted reconnaissance along enemy coastlines on Sunday, obtaining much useful information. British forces landed in several locations and made contact with German forces, inflicting many casualties. Some enemy corpses fell into our hands, and our forces also suffered casualties. According to a Reuters military correspondent, this British landing shows the difficulty for the German forces to try to maintain the entire northern coastline (from the North Cape in the far north of Europe, along the coasts of Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France, straight down to the Spanish border), because the German navy's strength has been greatly reduced in battles with the Allied navy. (Reuters, 27th)

London: The Times newspaper published an article commenting on yesterday's British raid on German forces at the Channel ports, saying that this action shows the British army's offensive spirit, which is what the public wants to see. This action also shows that we neither need nor intend to simply sit and wait for an attack, but when the opportunity arises, or can be found, we are prepared and able to attack the areas occupied by the enemy. In short, sea power is not a worthless tool, as the enemy claims. The authorities' communiqué did not mention many battle achievements, and they do not want to exaggerate elsewhere either, but this British military action is at least not something that a country suffering from spiritual or material inferiority could fully plan and carry out. (Reuters, 27th)

### British Blockade Measures Extended to French Ports

### German and Italian War Reports

Hitler's Headquarters: This afternoon's German war report stated that German forces had advanced according to the terms of the armistice agreement to the Dordogne area, east of Bordeaux. The enemy navy had reconnoitered the northern coast of France the night before and attempted to attack, but was repulsed due to its limited strength. A German submarine reported sinking 33,000 tons of enemy merchant ships. Last night, German fighters again bombed British seaports and airfields. One German aircraft did not return to base. British aircraft continued to bomb western Germany. Many German civilians were killed and injured last night. There was no damage to military targets.

He has recently performed meritorious service again. (Haitong, 27th)

Berlin: The war on the Western Front has ended, but the war against Britain continues. Military experts gave speeches supplementing the German war report, stating that it is not yet known when the German army will occupy the locations stipulated by the German-French armistice agreement. The date of occupation will likely be decided after the Armistice Commission, chaired by General Stülpnagel, is established in Wiesbaden. Britain is currently the only enemy of the German army, and the German army will use all its strength to continue fighting against Britain. German aircraft continue to bomb airfields and aircraft industry centers in central Britain. Three British bombers made a second attack on Stavanger Airport in Norway. Two were shot down by German fighters, and the third fled in panic. A German submarine sank a British armed ship of 12,000 tons in the southwest of Ireland, and also sank two other armed merchant ships. (Haitong, 27th)

At that time, the British ship, along with another British cruiser and two torpedo boats, returned fire, but to no avail. (Haitong, 27th)

### German Newspaper Comments on Armistice Agreement

Berlin: The German "Political Foreign Communications" today published an article commenting on the German-French and Italian-French armistice agreements, pointing out that although the French government authorities, when engaging in war with Germany, did not harbor defensive intentions, but annihilation intentions, the German authorities did not want to inflict revenge, placing the French people in difficulty, because France once wanted to destroy its survival, its independence, and its unification. Germany had suffered deeply from humiliation after the last world war, and this time it was determined not to reciprocate the French by treating them as France had treated them. (Haitong, 27th)

### Britain Unwilling to Consider Peace Issues

London: Rumors circulating in London that the British ambassador to Spain, Sir Samuel Hoare, had discussed peace issues or armistice terms in Madrid are absolutely untrue. In fact, Hoare has firmly declared Britain's determination to continue the struggle. (Reuters, 27th)

London: Parliamentary sources here reported yesterday that Führer Hitler is preparing to deliver a speech this Friday, predicting that he will propose a peace plan, declaring Germany's satisfaction with what it has obtained and Germany's willingness to negotiate an agreement with Britain. Well-informed circles predict that if Germany proposes terms of peace, they will surely be rejected. (Associated Press, 27th)

### China Prepares to Use Force to Protect Sino-Vietnamese Transportation; Vietnamese Authorities Undertake Preparations; Japanese Troops Have Been Blocked at Suilu

Chongqing: Reliable sources here claimed yesterday that China is now fully prepared to use force or other means to prevent the closing of the Sino-Vietnamese border. They criticized the Franco-Japanese agreement to halt the transportation of war materials into China via Annam, stating that China will do everything possible to obstruct the implementation of the agreement. Vietnam is Chinese territory, seized by France after the Sino-French War in 1885. If France is unable to defend its territory, it should be returned to China rather than placed under Japanese occupation or control. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Hong Kong: Reports here state that Vietnamese authorities are currently taking all precautions to prevent possible aggression. The current governor is acting independently from the Bordeaux government, but he reportedly still recognizes the validity of the Franco-Japanese agreement to jointly patrol the border area. French women and children are being moved inland from the coast and the Chinese border. However, current Japanese troop movements seem limited to the Guangxi area, with troops stationed along the border between that province and Vietnam. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

London: The French National Committee recently stated that its leader, de Gaulle, has received a report from the Governor-General of Vietnam, Catroux, stating that French forces are prepared to resist any attempts to invade Vietnam. The Committee also told the press that it believes General Nogues, Commander-in-Chief of French forces in North Africa, has taken all necessary steps to deal with any aggression. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun reports that the Foreign Ministry will issue an oral statement tomorrow, declaring that East Asia has the right to independently prevent the spread of the European war to Asia and to resolve the China Incident. The newspaper anticipates that the gist of the statement will be as follows: (1) Interference by third countries in East Asia will not be tolerated. (2) Japan will severely and rigorously punish any attempt to disadvantage Japan's current situation in East Asia. (3) Japan's policy of non-involvement in the European war will be extended to the entirety of East Asia. (4) As long as Germany and Italy do not disrupt the security of East Asia, Japan's friendly relations with them will become closer. At the same time, under the current circumstances, some friction between Japan and the United States and Britain is perhaps unavoidable, as Japan's objective is to establish East Asia's autonomy. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Tokyo: Navy spokesman Rear Admiral Kanazawa declared today at a press conference that a Japanese naval unit has been dispatched to Haiphong to inspect whether the transport of goods via Vietnam to China is indeed being prohibited by the French government. Land transportation conditions in Vietnam will be monitored by Japanese inspectors, while sea routes will be inspected by the navy. The dispatch of these warships to Haiphong is merely a temporary measure. A very large number of supplies have been transported to the Chongqing government via French Indochina, British Burma, and Hong Kong. Currently, the transport of supplies to China via Vietnam is nearing its end, while the flow of goods into China via Burma and Hong Kong is becoming more active. Therefore, Japan has lodged a strong protest with the British government and is awaiting a response from London. At the same time, the Japanese government and local Japanese forces are closely monitoring the development of the situation. When a reporter asked whether Japanese air force would reconnoiter the Burma route, the spokesman replied that, for obvious reasons, it was not appropriate to comment on future Japanese military actions, but that it was quite possible for Japanese air force to fly over the Burma route. The spokesman also said that, according to newspaper reports, Japanese pilots who reconnoitered the area bordering Vietnam and Guangxi province yesterday had sighted dozens of motor vehicles loaded with supplies traveling from Vietnam to China. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Chongqing: According to a Chinese spokesperson today, a portion of the Japanese forces in southern Guangxi advanced southwest from Nanning on the 21st, attempting to push towards the Sino-Vietnamese border.

Hong Kong: According to reports from Haiphong, the French Indochina government had already closed off traffic between Guangxi and Vietnam when Japanese forces approached Longzhou. Now, with reports of Japanese troops being sighted near Dongxing on the Chinese side, they have also urgently closed off traffic on the border between Guangdong and Vietnam. Martial law has also been declared in Lang Son, Dong Dang, and Na Cham. According to disclosures from Japanese sources here, Japanese forces are urgently seeking to expand their encirclement of Vietnam in order to completely cut off Sino-Vietnamese transportation. (Express News dispatch, 27th)

Tokyo: According to a semi-official Japanese source in South China, Japanese troops do not intend to invade French Indochina, but only to intercept the movement of military supplies being transported via Vietnam to General Chiang Kai-shek's forces. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Hong Kong: The Hong Kong government announced that Japanese troops have completely blockaded traffic between Hong Kong and mainland China today. The Japanese military authorities will only permit entry to and exit from Hong Kong along the border at specified times on July 1 and 2, after which all traffic will be completely prohibited. (Express News dispatch, 27th)

Hong Kong: In light of the threatening attitude taken by the Japanese press and recent Japanese spokesmen, the Hong Kong authorities are implementing precautionary measures. Bridges across the Shenzhen River have been destroyed. It is reported that British women and children living near the border have been ordered to return to the city. Unofficial sources believe that the Japanese side will deal with Hong Kong in the same way as they blockaded the British and French concessions in Tianjin. An official spokesman has firmly denied the Japanese claim that military supplies are being transported into China via Hong Kong. (Dispatch, 27th)

Wengyuan: After the Japanese troops in Pingshan were defeated by Chinese forces on the 26th, the Japanese repeatedly reinforced from Shenzhen and counterattacked.

Manila: According to reports from Hong Kong, the situation there is becoming increasingly tense due to the Japanese blockade. The majority of residents have plans to send their families to Manila.

Tianjin: Reuters has learned from responsible sources that, according to the basic terms of the Tianjin agreement signed by Britain and Japan in Tokyo, ten Japanese military police officers will be stationed in the British Concession, residing in the courtyard of the Japanese Consul-General's residence on Yingzhong Street. At the same time, Major Ota, commander of the Tianjin Japanese military police, has been appointed as a liaison officer, with an office in the police headquarters of the British Municipal Council. His duties will be to maintain contact between the British and Japanese police authorities. As for the purpose of stationing Japanese military police in the British Concession, it is only so that the Japanese military police can immediately join when the British Municipal Council wants to search for suspected terrorists in the presence of Japanese officers. At present, Japanese police will still not be able to independently conduct searches within the British Concession without the cooperation of the British authorities, and will still only have observer status. It is reported that the same method is now being implemented in the French Concession. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

### Promotion Principles for the Honorific Title of National Father

Chongqing: The matter of honoring the Premier with the title of National Father to express respect has been circulated to the entire country by central government order for compliance.

### Arita Enters the Palace to Pay Homage to the Japanese Emperor and Submits a New Policy Outline

Tokyo Foreign Minister Arita entered the palace today to pay homage to the Japanese Emperor and submitted an informal report on the new outline principles of Japan's diplomatic policy. The development of the European war situation is likely to threaten the Far East, so new principles must be established as a stabilizing force in East Asia.

Qualified observers believe that the statement will contain three points as follows: (1) Japan absolutely cannot tolerate any changes in the status quo of East Asia, as this would interfere with Japan's handling of the China Incident, which it is currently pursuing with all its might. (2) Japan is deeply concerned about any attempts to change the status quo of East Asia, whether by Britain, the United States, Germany, or Italy. (3) Japan adheres to a policy of non-intervention in the European war, but will independently deal with the impact of the European war on East Asia.

### President Roosevelt's Third Term Re-election Seems Inevitable Fate

Washington: The European war situation is becoming increasingly complicated, so President Roosevelt's third re-election seems to be an inevitable fate. Republicans secretly gathered in Washington and believed that Roosevelt has an influence on today's American political stage that cannot be underestimated, so the November 4 election will be a fierce competition. Whether Roosevelt himself wants to be re-elected is still unknown, but the movement to support Roosevelt's re-election has reached a very high stage, so experienced observers believe that if Roosevelt wants to be re-elected, Roosevelt will definitely be elected in the primaries held in Chicago in July. A year ago, wise Democratic politicians all said that this could never happen. A year ago, Republicans were all confident that their party, which had been out of power for eight years, would finally achieve final victory in 1940. However, also a year ago, President Roosevelt warned the country that the European war would soon occur. At that time, many people did not believe him. Then, on September 1, 1939, Hitler ordered his troops to enter Poland, and many people initially thought that the European war would never affect the United States and the entire Western Hemisphere. But then, on May 10 of this year, Hitler launched his blitzkrieg tactics and took the Netherlands and Belgium in one fell swoop, causing the Allies to abandon their armor and flee. Then, both Roosevelt's friends and enemies recognized that Roosevelt's judgment of the international situation was accurate, even recalling Roosevelt's speech in Chicago in October 1937, when he suggested imposing "quarantine" procedures on certain aggressive countries and suggested "various strategies to prevent war." However, it only shocked the country and earned a round of ridicule and criticism. Today, precisely because Roosevelt has agile thinking and a broad vision, Democrats have the hope of a third victory. The opinions of some observers are that the competition Roosevelt will face in this election will largely depend on the development of the European situation in the coming months. According to Roosevelt's medical advisors, although Roosevelt is 59 years old this year, he is mentally and physically strong. Roosevelt's smile and his speeches on radio and the podium still have a moving magic. However, those who have met with Roosevelt every day in the past eight years have said that in the last eleven months, several new wrinkles have been added to Roosevelt's face, and his hair has also turned gray. In the previous seven years, Roosevelt's New Deal, although hard work, had never shown this phenomenon. (International Press dispatch, 27th)

### British and Danish Ships Sunk

### Pittman Discusses British Defense, Says No Defense Preparedness; Londoners Surprised

Washington - U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman, while giving his opinion to reporters here yesterday, stated that the most effective method to prevent Hitler's advance is to continue fighting from the New World, rather than striving to defend the British Isles. It is now no secret that Britain has no defense preparedness whatsoever. No matter what assistance the United States provides, it will only delay the outcome of the war. It is now evident that Congress will not permit involvement in the European war, he said. (Reuter, 27th)

London - British figures were quite surprised upon hearing the remarks made by U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman regarding British defense plans. Some quarters here today issued criticisms, expressing strong disagreement with the claims that Britain has no defense preparedness and that the assistance the United States can provide cannot change the outcome of the war. However, they stated that American factories and workers are currently making great efforts to assist Britain in conducting its certain war. The British are extremely grateful. If Britain, with its 45 million people, were to quietly lay down its arms and not fight, it would fail to live up to the great intentions of American assistance. However, Britain has absolutely no intention of surrendering without a fight, but rather holds the determination to continue fighting and ultimately achieve victory. (Reuter, 27th)

### US Grants Credit Loan to Argentina; Argentina Sends Commercial Representatives to Germany and Italy

Washington - Jones, Chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, announced yesterday that the Export-Import Bank has granted a $20 million credit loan to the Argentine government for the purpose of purchasing railway and highway equipment from the United States. (Associated Press, 27th)

Argentine Capital - Argentine Senator Sulonduto declared that current European affairs indicate a new order is about to be realized, and the economy will also be affected. Argentina has promptly dispatched a commercial delegation to Italy, Spain, and other countries to gather commercial information needed by Argentina. (Haitong, 27th)

The Ministry of Education has a strict prohibition against private, unapproved schools falsely using approved status to enroll students in newspapers.

### Japan's Ambitions Fully Exposed, Southern Advance Almost Imminent; Rumors that Japan will Land in Hong Kong or Vietnam; The United States Will Definitely Express Itself to Protect Its Interests

According to foreign sources, the Indian Independence League in Tokyo has made a request to the Japanese and German authorities to preserve the freedom of French Vietnam and Dutch East Indies. The League passed a resolution stating that Japan should assist Annam and Dutch East Indies in maintaining their independence in Asia and establishing two countries in Asia. This action will be unanimously supported by Asians. To Germany, in addition to congratulating it on its victory over France, it also requested Germany to "force" France and the Netherlands to maintain the complete freedom of Annam and Dutch East Indies.

Hong Kong and Vietnam - The Situation is Urgent

The Dalu Daily reported that political circles here received private news last night (June 26) stating that after the Japanese military and consulate authorities made a request to the British authorities in Hong Kong on Monday to close the Hong Kong supply route to Chongqing, the Hong Kong authorities have begun to move important documents to Singapore. It is heard that the Japanese side has also requested that all Chinese officials and organizations related to the Chongqing government be expelled from Hong Kong. According to a Hong Kong telegram from International News Service, four Japanese divisions have sailed from Japan to China. According to information learned from Shanghai last night, the Japanese troops will land near Hong Kong or Vietnam. If their destination is Hong Kong, they will arrive and land on the 28th or 29th.

British Policy - Extremely Important

Yesterday's Reuter telegram stated that London has received a request from the Japanese government through the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie. The Japanese side requested that the United Kingdom take effective measures to stop all war material supplies from being transported to China through Burma and Hong Kong. The British government is currently reviewing and considering this request. Chinese circles in this city are extremely concerned about this. However, it is hoped that the British authorities will thoroughly understand that concessions and compromises with the aggressor will not only fail to achieve a situation of temporary peace, but will also fuel the aggressor's ambitions. Past facts are not uncommon, and the British government should also be aware of this.

Dutch East Indies Navy - Strong Strength

The North China Daily News stated that the Dutch Navy is still maintaining its normal state in the Dutch East Indies. Although its number is small, its combat power is extremely strong. It includes four new-type cruisers, including the Ruytir (6,450 tons) and the TromP (3,350 tons), which are currently in the national territorial waters. Defensive battleships and armed gunboats are also moored along the coast of the Netherlands, as well as 13 torpedo boats and submarines ranging from 150 tons to 264 tons, with a displacement of approximately 500 tons or more. The East Indies Fleet has two cruisers, equipped with 10-inch guns, eight destroyers, and seven submarines. The above ships can carry aircraft or install torpedoes when necessary.

The United States Will Definitely Take Action

The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury published an article last night by renowned British commentator Woodhead discussing the consequences of Japan's southward advance. According to Woodhead's opinion, it is not possible to conclude at this time whether the Tokyo authorities will take more active actions than blockading Vietnam. In short, some people in Japan strongly advocate:

Utilizing the European war situation to attack Britain, the United States, and France. The Miani cabinet's failure to end the war in China has caused dissatisfaction among all parties. The cabinet may be reorganized in the future and presided over by extremists. These people attempt to "expel the countries that support the old order in East Asia." Their ambition is obvious. They believe that Vietnam is already

"A ripe fruit that will fall with a touch." If they can seize power and control the overall situation, Japan will definitely break with Britain and the United States. The United States' reaction to Japan's invasion of Vietnam cannot be predicted at this time. From the perspective of American interests, the United States is more concerned about maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies than Vietnam. The Dutch East Indies

The production of rubber accounts for two-fifths of the world's total production. At the same time, the United States also has a substantial interest in maintaining the traffic on the Yunnan Railway, which is the only export outlet for the Chinese government to export goods to repay US loans. Most of China's tung oil, tungsten iron, and aluminum rely on this road for export.

The Burma-Yunnan Highway can currently only transport hundreds of tons of goods. Woodhead finally believed that France, in its current situation, cannot refuse the Japanese request, but if its acceptance of the Japanese request results in hindering Sino-US trade, the US authorities will undoubtedly lodge a strong protest with both Japan and France.

### "July 7th" Incident - Third Anniversary

The third anniversary of the July 7th Incident is fast approaching. All circles in this city regard this day as the beginning of the war of resistance, national reconstruction, and national revival. At that time, they will unanimously use a silent attitude to make a solemn commemoration and mourn the fallen soldiers. According to the central government's regulations, this day is the Memorial Day for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. It will be commemorated enthusiastically throughout the country. However, due to the special environment in this city, the commemorative ceremony will be suspended as it was last year. The Public Concession Bureau of Works and the French Concession Municipal Council, in order to prevent unscrupulous elements from taking the opportunity to cause trouble at this time of unrest, will take precautions in advance, prohibit various gatherings, and implement special precautions for one day to prevent and maintain public security.

### The Japanese Puppet Government Covets the Court; The Authorities Ignore It; The Bureau of Works Denies Negotiations

The Japanese puppet government has long coveted the courts of the Shanghai Special Area. It is not known that the court was agreed upon and constituted by the Chinese government and the countries that have treaties in China. Before the treaty is abolished, both parties should abide by it and cannot be transferred to the puppet government by one party's will. According to the Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury yesterday, Philip, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, denied again on the morning of the 27th the statement made by the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy regarding the jurisdiction of the local court in the Special Area of Muddy Banks. It is said that this issue has not been negotiated, and the court is constituted by the Chinese government and the countries that have treaties in China. The Bureau of Works has no relationship with the court in any way. What the Bureau of Works cares about is that the local court in the Shanghai Special Area can effectively continue to perform its duties and handle civil and criminal cases.

### Rice Ban Lifted in Hong Kong; Shanghai Municipal Council Approves Encouraging Wheat Imports

The Shanghai Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association previously submitted a request to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to forward to the authorities, seeking to facilitate the source of wheat. Yesterday, they received a reply from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating that they had received a letter from Mr. Cabot, Deputy General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council, which read: "Regarding your letter of June 17th concerning facilitating the source of wheat, this council will make every effort to encourage the import of a considerable amount of wheat to reassure the citizens. Please set your minds at ease."

Bean and Rice Industry

The Industry Association once sent representatives to appeal to the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting them to ask the British Consul-General to negotiate the permission to transport Hong Kong rice to Shanghai for relief, in order to stabilize the market situation. Yesterday, reliable news was obtained from the rice industry that local firms such as Yu Shenglong had received telegrams from Hong Kong rice merchants reporting that the Hong Kong authorities had already lifted the ban, allowing the export of rice. It is generally believed that the reason for this is that shipping between Haiphong and Hong Kong is now open, and tribute rice can be directly transported to Hong Kong. Since the opening of shipping between Haiphong and Hong Kong, various local firms immediately entrusted the French firm D’Affre to telegraph Saigon to order a large amount of tribute rice, around 10,000 tons. It is now known that 5,000 tons of tribute rice

Have Already Set Sail

And should arrive around July 10th, and are currently en route to Shanghai. It is also known that various local firms, in order to increase reserves and eliminate public panic about food, in addition to commissioning the purchase of Saigon rice for transport to Shanghai, are continuing to entrust the British firm Jardine Matheson to telegraph Siam to order a large amount of Siamese rice, reaching over 13,000 tons. It is now known that the Jardine Matheson vessel Srela Smales, carrying 5,600 tons, will arrive on July 18th, and the vessel Believic, carrying 4,600 tons, will arrive on July 26th. As for the 3,200 tons ordered by the Jinan Huaxing Company, it will arrive on July 26th, totaling 13,400 tons. Various rice industry firms are still planning to continuously entrust these foreign firms to order a large amount of foreign rice in order to decide to transport it to Shanghai for regulation.

### British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen to Broadcast on Saturday

Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, who has returned to Shanghai from Chongqing, will broadcast on the radio station (Xmhd) this Saturday (June 29th). The radio station's frequency is 760 kilocycles and 395 meters. At the same time, the radio station (Xcdm), with a frequency of 1440 kilocycles and 208 meters, will rebroadcast the program. The British Ambassador will make two broadcasts. The first will be at 12:45 pm Shanghai summer time (i.e., 11:45 am China coastal time), and the second will be at 9:00 pm Shanghai summer time (i.e., 8:00 pm China coastal time).

### Tianjin Area to Control Cloth

Initial Step for Controlling Imports - Other Goods Will Receive the Same Treatment

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, North China first fell, resulting in various industries being controlled. As for the ports of Yantai, Weihaiwei, Longkou, and Qingdao, import and export trade, all goods have been controlled. Since its implementation, it has been nearly a year. Transactions are carried out without cash, practicing barter. Over the years, merchants have suffered greatly, and even foreign merchants have been considerably affected. However, business in Tianjin has not changed. Although the selling prices of grains and flour have been stipulated, import and export goods have not been controlled. Recently, it has been heard that in North China, Japanese cloth is being dumped in large quantities, in order to monopolize the market. From July 1st, imported cotton yarn into Tianjin will be controlled first, in order to achieve its monopolistic intent. Therefore, merchants from the Tianjin community in Shanghai have reduced their procurement of cotton yarn in order to avoid unnecessary losses. Although currently only cotton yarn is controlled, it will be difficult for other goods to avoid the same treatment in the future.

### Shanghai West "Special Police" Unlikely to be Established

Illegal Activities Continue Unabated; Special Police Will Likely Be Unable to Organize

The Shanghai Times reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" signed an agreement on February 16th this year regarding police affairs in the area of roads built beyond the boundary in western Shanghai. However, there is no hope for the establishment of the special police force in that area. According to a senior official of the Police Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the police department has submitted a proposal for the organization of a special police force, which is awaiting a response from the "Municipal Government." Without a response, the establishment of the special police force

Will Have No Progress

The existence of gambling dens in the western district is the main obstacle to the establishment of the special police force. Not long ago, most of the gambling dens were closed, but now they have changed their names and reopened. If such illegal activities continue unabated, the police force in the western district cannot be established. Therefore, the special police force

Can Only Be Established After All Gambling Dens in the Western District Are Closed

The official continued that once the "Municipal Government" has responded and given its consent, the special police force can begin to be organized. However, the selection of personnel for the special police force has not yet been determined. It is not possible to say when the special police force can be established because it is not known when the "Municipal Government" will respond. According to the Western District Police Agreement, the new police force will consist of 1,200 police officers, who will be selected from the Police Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Municipal Police Bureau."

### American Ships Leave Shanghai

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, the American ships Marblehead, Luzon, and Wake will sail from Shanghai at noon today (the 27th). The cruiser Marblehead will go to Qingdao and is expected to return to Shanghai within a week or ten days. The river gunboats Luzon and Wake will travel to the Yangtze River, and may return to Shanghai within three days. The Marblehead arrived in Shanghai and was stationed on the 12th of this month, while the two gunboats arrived in Shanghai from South China on the 15th of this month.

### Strike at the Shanghai Times

Over one hundred workers at the Shanghai Times, located at 160 Avenue Edward VII, went on strike because the price of rice and other goods has recently soared, making life difficult. The monthly wage of thirty yuan is not enough to maintain a livelihood. The workers elected several representatives on the 26th to request a wage increase from the management: 60% increase for wages below 30 yuan, 55% increase for wages below 40 yuan, 50% increase for wages below 50 yuan, and 40% increase for wages above 50 yuan. After negotiations between labor and management, the management promised to respond in three days. Yesterday, the management did not respond, and the workers went on strike. The Political Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council learned of this and sent personnel to mediate, but to no avail. All the workers left the premises in the afternoon. It is said that the management has given the workers a deadline to resume work immediately, otherwise they will be dismissed.

### Two Refugee Camps to Close

Since charitable organizations began the work of disbanding their refugee camps, the number of refugees has decreased from 50,000 to over 27,000. At the end of this month, two more refugee camps will be closed. One is the Aiwen Refugee Camp on North Suzhou Road within the "Municipal Chamber of Commerce" of the Benevolent Relief Association, and the other is the First Refugee Camp on Wenjian Shi Road of the Benevolent Relief Branch. Both refugee camps were opened during the Shanghai War. Currently, they have a total of over 700 people. The refugees in these two refugee camps, except for a portion who will be given money to leave, will all be merged into the Dunxin Road Refugee Camp. The Benevolent Relief Branch is scheduled to issue severance pay today at its office on Avenue Edward VII (17 yuan per adult, 15 yuan per child). The association's education group has stipulated that the refugee schools in each camp will hold end-of-term exams on July 8th and begin summer tutoring on the 15th. Currently, each refugee costs about 10 yuan per month, and donations are urgently needed.

### Shanghai Compatriots Respond to the Winter Clothing Drive, Pledging 500,000 Yuan

Chongqing, 27th - The National Winter Clothing Drive Association recently held a plenary committee meeting and decided to launch a fundraising campaign this year. The detailed measures are being drafted. Upon hearing the news, the compatriots in Shanghai immediately responded with a telegram, pledging 500,000 yuan in advance for winter clothing. This shows that the compatriots in Shanghai, despite being in dire straits, are even more eager to think of the heroic soldiers fighting in the resistance war, which is truly inspiring.

### In Memory of Father Lebbe (Part 2)

— GBC

Father Lebbe willingly embraced poverty and lived frugally. His clothes and belongings were mostly old and worn, turning from black to yellow, long overdue to be put away, yet he continued to use them, unable to part with them. Although he was harsh on himself, he was extremely kind to others, to the point of "always granting requests," not only to the Chinese but also to people from Belgium, France, Germany, and Austria. It is said that his "compassion" was universal, without distinction of nationality or race, as long as he had it. Students often asked him for maxims, and he always wrote the old saying: "Where charity is, there God is." He truly had charity and was very humble. We never heard him say anything bad about China. In his view, everything in China was good. He often admonished young people not to criticize others' strengths and weaknesses because nine out of ten judgments are wrong. He absolutely obeyed the Holy Church, loved the clergy, and deeply hated atheism and anti-religious doctrines.

Father Lebbe lived to be sixty-three years old and possessed extraordinary talents, so he accomplished extraordinary and amazing things. Whether it was success or failure, let us not discuss it for now, but this spirit of courageously pursuing forward, only cultivating and not asking for harvest, is enough to make the cowardly retreat. Moreover, a founder is not necessarily a successful person. There are countless precedents in history. But Father Lebbe's lifelong hard work, struggle, sacrifice, selflessness, neither envying fame nor seeking profit, in the eyes of ordinary people, is it not "all empty in the end"? Was Father Lebbe not lost? What were his goals and motives? We have also analyzed Father Lebbe's words and deeds, not a chemical or physical analysis, but a rational and ethical analysis, and we feel that his every word and deed, regardless of time or place, regardless of tone or manner, always had a final aim, like a great river flowing into the sea, which is "Love God above all things, love your neighbor as yourself." He said it this way, he did it this way, so in the depths of his marrow and in his blood, there was the shadow of God, and the highest commandment mentioned above. In short, Father Lebbe was a priest, and the mission of a priest is supernatural, not natural.

Before the July 7th Incident, Father Lebbe worked hard in social affairs, not only founding the Yi Shi Bao in Tianjin and Beiping, but also the renowned Ta Kung Pao, which he co-founded with Mr. Ying Lianzhi in Beiping. Therefore, his departure was deeply mourned and sympathized with by the press. After the July 7th Incident, Father Lebbe returned to the battlefields in the north and south, specializing in relief work. It has long been heard that he continued his work despite illness, and that he died from it. Now that dawn is in sight and victory is in sight, Father Lebbe died with his aspirations, sleeping forever by Mount Gele. Looking west, tears streaming down his face, the poem says: "When a person dies, the country is devastated." Alas, how sad! (The End)

### Alleged Police Agreement Established Between Japanese and French Concession

It is heard that the Japanese side presented to the French Concession authorities on the 21st the idea of establishing a police agreement, the contents of which include (1) extradition of criminals, (2) public searches, etc. Yesterday, news spread that negotiations have already established an agreement between both parties, but confirmation is still needed.

### Armed Robbers Kill and Plunder in Zha Port

A few days ago, two rice shops in the Nanhui County hired a boat to Huangqiao and bought two boats of white rice, totaling over 360 dan. While being transported back, they passed through Zha Port and were robbed by six or seven armed bandits who, under the guise of inspecting the cargo hold, robbed the rice boats and all nine crew members. The rice was sold in the nearby area, and all nine crew members were brutally murdered to silence them. After several days, the owner heard about the incident and reported the facts, and a chief constable was sent to investigate. Unexpectedly, the constable's actions were not discreet and were discovered by the bandits, who also killed him to eliminate the evidence. In addition, a relative of the boat owner, who ran a sack shop in Zha Port, saw two empty boats moored in the bay about half a mile north of the port. With no one guarding them, he notified his relative to come and claim them. Just as they were about to take the empty boats back, five or six armed men suddenly arrived and detained the four people looking for the boats. They were severely beaten that night and buried alive in the suburbs of Zha Port. Among them was Xu Guisheng, the boat owner's son, who was still young. He desperately crawled out of the soil and sought help from a nearby village, where he was sent to Zhoupu Hospital for treatment. However, he died in the hospital four days later due to his injuries. Currently, most rice merchants in the area dare not go out to buy rice, resulting in no rice being sold around Qin Gongtang, so the price of rice is higher than in Shanghai, and people have no rice to buy, causing great anxiety.

### Relief Grain Distribution in Nanshi Refugee Area

Due to Father Jacquinot leaving Shanghai, the Nanshi Refugee Area will be closed at the end of this month. The office in the area is actively handling the repatriation procedures. It is stipulated that each repatriated refugee will be given one month's worth of relief grain, which began to be distributed yesterday. The distribution schedule and quantity are as follows: 6 days of grain (3 pounds of white rice) distributed on the 27th (i.e., yesterday), 9 days of grain (4.5 pounds) distributed on the 28th, 10 days of grain (5 pounds) distributed on the 29th, and 6 days of grain (3 pounds) distributed on the 30th. The distribution will be completed by the end of this month, totaling 31 days and 15.5 pounds. There are still about 19,000 refugees in the area receiving grain. Although the Aftercare Committee has stipulated that the elderly and weak should be transferred to the New Public Nursery, the nursery is limited in space and can only accommodate 400 to 500 people, so most of the refugees are being dispersed. It is understood that the Supervisory Committee and the General Office in charge of the area will be dissolved at the end of this month along with the dispersal of the refugees. Only the Aftercare Committee, headed by Xie Shibo, will temporarily maintain operations due to facilities such as the New Public Nursery, the First Hospital, and the Charity Maternity Hospital in the area.

### Japanese Banknote Issuance Doubled

Since Japan launched its war of aggression against China, its domestic finances have been exhausted due to massive military spending, and the currency has become increasingly inflated. According to statistics at the end of March of this year, the total amount of banknotes issued in Japan was 3,024 million yen in Bank of Japan notes, 444.4 million yen in Bank of Korea notes, and 165 million yen in Bank of Taiwan notes. In addition, there were 24.6 million yen in subsidiary currency notes, bringing the total to 3,879 million yen, an increase of 121 million yen compared to last year, representing 45.3%. Since the "China Incident" in 1937, the inflation of the Japanese currency has increased by 94.50%, doubling. Compared to 1928, the inflation of the Japanese currency has been 225.80%. The inflation of the Japanese currency is clearly not for commercial application, as the circulation of checks on the market has not increased comparatively. Therefore, the inflation of the Japanese currency is purely due to the war.

### Payment of Principal and Interest on Consolidated Public Bonds to Begin

Black Market Prices Soar

After the four banks, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank of China, discounted the ninth installment of principal and interest on the Consolidated Public Bonds of the Republic of China in 1936, the Central Bank and its entrusted banks will begin payment on July 31st. Due to the approaching date of principal and interest repayment and the government's determination to maintain credit, prices in the Shanghai securities black market have soared. Yesterday's closing prices were: Class A, 61.3 yuan, up 0.35 yuan; Class B, 51.8 yuan, up 0.2 yuan; Class C, 50.05 yuan, up 0.25 yuan; and Class E, 49.8 yuan, up 0.35 yuan.

### Last Batch of Mail from Paris Arrives in Shanghai by Ship

Since the expansion of the European War, the situation in the Mediterranean has become tense, and shipping through the Suez Canal has been disrupted. Mail from Europe to Shanghai has been rerouted through the United States and shipped to Shanghai. The first batch arrived on the President Coolidge of the American President Lines on the 27th. According to a Daguang News Agency reporter's inquiry with the Postal Administration yesterday, the ship carried a total of 811 bags of mail for Shanghai, including 105 bags from Liverpool, England, and 22 bags from Paris, France, sealed and sent to Shanghai on May 6th. This is the last batch of mail before the fall of Paris and is of particular interest to the French community in Shanghai.

### Wang Jiachen Uses Diversion to Steal Gold Jewelry and is Detained

In a moment of desperation, he steals his uncle's property. Handed over to the police, he is ordered to post bail pending investigation.

Wang Jiachen, a young man from Ningbo, received a considerable education. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he ran a business in the Chinese area of Shanghai and was quite well-off. After the war, his family property was lost, and he has been unemployed ever since. He and his wife are trapped in a room at 47 Maizilu, Maizili, French Concession, and have been living on borrowed money for the past three years. He has borrowed from all his relatives and friends in Shanghai, but with the high cost of living and his wife about to give birth, he urgently needs money. He wanted to continue

Bothering his friends and relatives, but they were tired of it. In a moment of desperation, he remembered that his uncle, Shen Wenming, was still doing well, and his aunt, Mei Fang, was young and easily fooled. So, he bought a fake gold bracelet and, on the morning of the 21st of last month, while Shen was away from home, he suddenly went to Shen's residence at 54 Renzhili, Dongxi Huade Road, Hongkou. Mei Fang saw that her nephew was wearing a suit and leather shoes and did not look poor. She did not know that he was unemployed and did not suspect him. During the meeting, Wang suddenly took out the fake gold bracelet and asked her to appraise it. Mei Fang,

Although its brilliance was very bright, the weight did not seem right, so she opened the box and took out a real gold bracelet to compare. She confirmed that it was a fake. Wang immediately changed his tone and said that in addition to asking her to determine the authenticity of the jewelry, he wanted to move because a neighbor had extra rooms for rent. He asked her to accompany him to rent the room. Mei Fang agreed. When they arrived, Wang said that the room was too small to accommodate a bed and asked Shen's wife to stay there temporarily. He had to return home quickly to measure the bed. He then returned to Shen's house and falsely told the maid that he had left a pen in the room. He tricked her into giving him the key to the room and then gave the maid one yuan in legal tender and told her to go to the market to buy rope to measure the bed. He then opened the door and entered the room,

Secretly took a gold bracelet, two gold rings, bank passbooks, and title deeds from the box. He then sold the gold jewelry to a department store and a jewelry store on Nanjing Road. He immediately became wealthy. His wife gave birth shortly after, and he was praised by others for obtaining a job at 97 Yuangmingyuan Road. His fortunes changed. However, when Shen and his wife returned home that day, they discovered the theft. After questioning the maid, they suspected that it was their nephew, Wang Jiachen, who had done it. But they did not know his address and could not investigate. Recently, they heard about Wang's place of employment and tried to

Find him in the Yuangmingyuan Road area. They finally met him on the afternoon before yesterday. They immediately reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court for trial. The suspect confessed in court and repeatedly expressed remorse, saying that he was willing to compensate for the value of the gold jewelry and begged to be spared punishment so that his family of three could be spared. However, Shen Wenming and his wife said that the defendant's whereabouts were erratic, and if he were released, their losses would be unrecoverable. After examination by the presiding judge, it was decided that since the two parties were relatives, he would be lenient and ordered Wang Jiachen to find a reliable business guarantor to leave and await a summons at a later date.

### Gunshots on Park Road: Young Woman Wounded by Bullet

At around 12:30 p.m. yesterday, a man named Jia and a friend walked out of the Park Road side door of the Four Lines Savings Society (across from the Carlton Theatre). As they were getting into his friend's car, just as the driver was starting the engine, a thug suddenly rushed forward, stuck a gun through the car window, and fired a shot. Fortunately, Jia and his friend were alert and quickly ducked, avoiding being hit. The bullet pierced a hole in the car. At that moment, a Shaoxing woman, Hua Zhang (36 years old, residing at 75 Hengchangli, South Chengdu Road), who had just left Cai Xiaoxiang's clinic after seeking medical treatment, was riding home in a rickshaw driven by Chen Jinjia (43 years old, residing in a flat at 53 Wuding Road, New Tokyo Road) from Jiangbei. The rickshaw was heading south at a fast pace when she was struck in the left chest by a stray bullet, which pierced her back. The bullet also injured rickshaw puller Chen Jinjia's left arm, causing him to bleed profusely. When a Chinese constable from 2025 arrived after hearing the gunshot, the thug had already disappeared. They summoned ambulance number 83 and sent the injured man and woman to Baolong Hospital for treatment.

### Shen Weihui Sentenced for Falsely Accusing Someone of Murder; Suspended Sentence Granted Due to Youth and First Offense

Shen Weihui (22 years old), from Chongming, who was formerly a teacher at Fenzhou Primary School on Fenzhou Road, was dismissed from his position by Gu Yansheng, the principal from Haimen, in January of this year because he often asked for leave. Shen harbored resentment and thought of revenge, but had no opportunity. Recently, he was introduced to work as

A teacher at the Lianyi Primary School at 57, Lane 208, Yangzhou Road. On the 13th of this month, he saw a newspaper report about the shocking dismemberment of a woman named Huang Jinxiu, who was killed out of jealousy. Shen then took the opportunity to write an English postcard, saying that Huang's death was instigated by Gu Yansheng, the principal of Fenzhou Primary School on Fenzhou Road, and that the writer of the postcard was responsible. He then mailed the postcard to the Yangshupu Police Station. Ji Xiucheng, the detective in charge of the case, went to Fenzhou School to investigate Gu and learned that it was Shen Weihui.

Shen was arrested for false accusation and two blank postcards, an ink bottle, and a pen were found in his home. He was taken to the First Special District Court for questioning. Prosecutor Jiang Shuzi presided over the Third Criminal Court hearing. Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, stated that Shen admitted in the police station that he did not know Huang Jinxiu and that he falsely accused her because Gu Yansheng, the principal of Fenzhou School, should not have refused to grant him two days of leave and had even

Shortened his salary by twelve yuan. Gu Yansheng then testified about the events and questioned the defendant's statement. At one point he was confused and wrote the English postcard and sent it to the police station, seeking leniency. Yan Fanggang, the defense lawyer, argued on his behalf. Judge Jiang declared to him that he was an intellectual and a teacher, and should not have falsely accused someone of such a serious crime as murder to vent his anger over a small matter. Considering that he was young and a first-time offender, he was sentenced to five months imprisonment, suspended for three years. The postcard, ink, and pen were confiscated.

### Rampant Banditry in Xujiahui District

Extremely Active in the Lujiabang Area

According to reliable sources from the Dazhong News Agency, after the French defense forces and police automatically withdrew from the Xujiahui Cathedral area, bandits immediately took the opportunity to operate in the area, robbing wealthy families. Their activities were even more intense in the Lujiabang area on the 1st of this week. A Japanese spokesman denied this information at a press conference the day before yesterday, stating that after the Japanese official learned of this information, they immediately began investigating the truth, but the results did not confirm anything.

### Armed Robbery Fails, Resistance to Arrest Leads to Shooting

Stray Bullet Wounds Two Passersby; Four Bandits Eventually Apprehended

At 10:30 p.m. last night, four bandits suddenly broke into the office of the Qian Fengyu Dyeing and Weaving Factory at 16, Lane 140, Fujian Road, Public Concession. Two of the bandits took out pistols to threaten the staff, intending to rob them. However, a staff member in the upstairs room shouted "Catch the thief!" and blew a whistle. The bandits heard the sound and knew that things were going wrong. Without robbing anything, they successively broke free and fled. As they reached the entrance of the lane, a patrolling constable passed by and, catching sight of the bandits, shouted at them to stop and attempted to search them. But the bandits immediately fired their guns to resist arrest. The constables also fired back. The bandits fired as they fled north along Fujian Road, pursued by the constables. Both sides fired multiple shots, and bullets flew everywhere. Passersby fled in all directions. At that time, two passersby, Zhu Wansen (32 years old, from Ningbo) and a woman, Yao Hongjie (28 years old, from Ningbo), were both struck in the right foot by stray bullets and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The bandits were pursued to the north of the Old Zhabei Bridge, where they disappeared into the darkness. After the investigation, the constables summoned an ambulance and sent the two injured to Renji Hospital for treatment.

### Mr. Feng Bingnan's Birthday Ode to His Mother (I): Expounding the Essence of the Eight Virtues Rooted in Utmost Filial Piety; Advocating Thrift and Initiative as the Foundation of the Eight Virtues

Last night at 9 o'clock, Mr. Feng Bingnan's fourth son, Zhenwei, delivered a speech on the essential meanings of the Five Teachings on behalf of his respected father at the New Star Radio Station. It was extremely important for social welfare. Therefore, we have specially transcribed it as follows:

June 29th is the 70th birthday of my mother. Starting from the 29th, a series of five lectures on the Five Teachings will be held at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA for five consecutive days from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM (new time); that is, June 29, June 30, July 1, July 2, and July 3. We are very honored and grateful that Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang and several other gentlemen have enthusiastically agreed to be the main speakers. Originally, I should have personally attended the meeting to greet everyone and thank the guest speakers and attending guests. However, since I fell ill in the 26th year, I have not yet recovered, and I am still unable to move freely, or even sit in a car, so I cannot come out in person. I am very sorry. Some say that since my health is not good, I should stay at home and take care of myself and not hold these Five Teachings lectures and other things. I should first find a way to restore my health. However, I believe that matters beneficial to the public cannot wait for the health of an individual. If one believes that something is indeed beneficial to the public, one should quickly do it because there is no guarantee when health will return. If one waits until one is healthy, it will be a long time. I believe that the Five Teachings lectures being held now are the best way to commemorate my mother's birthday. My feeling that society needs to be improved did not begin this year. I have had this idea for many years, but when I was young, I was busy trying to become self-reliant, and in middle age, I was serving various businesses. I really did not have any free time to spare. Therefore, although I have always had this in mind for the past two or three decades, I have always felt that I lacked the time and ability, so I have been unable to find a concrete way to realize this aspiration. Since the 26th year, I have been spending 50-60% of my time in bed, and my body and mind have been relatively free. I have used this leisure time to organize the unsystematic ideas that I have accumulated in my mind for decades and plan how to improve society. Gradually, it became more concrete and systematic. However, every time I planned a method, after three or four days, I would find various shortcomings, so I had to reconsider and study it from the beginning. This has happened countless times. It was not until recently that I felt it was more meticulous and progressive. However, I still do not dare to be completely confident or certain. It can only be regarded as a rough prototype. This year happens to be my mother's 70th birthday. I will take this opportunity to realize what I have learned in the past few years, whether I can do it independently or whether I need the help of others, as a commemoration of my mother's birthday. The decision is because I have been living in society for more than half a century, and I have received so much from society. I should repay society. The Five Teachings lectures are one of the plans. There are others, which I will talk about later.

The kindness of our parents in nurturing and raising us is as boundless as the sky. When the elderly have a major birthday, as children and grandchildren, we should of course think about making them happy and doing something memorable for them. What is the best way to commemorate? What will make the elderly happy? Regarding commemorating parents' birthdays, there are many ready-made methods in the world. If I were to simply copy them, I would not have to bother to plan. The general worldly methods are probably nothing more than banquets with relatives and friends, or singing performances, or buying things that the elderly like. I think these methods are all appropriate because a person's filial thoughts towards their parents are a matter of the heart. Since we want our parents to enjoy our filial piety, we naturally need to express it outwardly. Therefore, banquets, entertainment, etc., are all expressions of filial piety and are methods that most people are willing to adopt. However, my situation is a bit different. I have always preferred quietness to activity, and I am not good at socializing. I think it is better to use a more lasting method than to adopt superficial formalities as a commemoration. Moreover, my mother is inherently indifferent and quiet and does not like pomp. She has repeatedly instructed me to keep things simple and not to disturb relatives and friends. In addition, the current situation is extremely difficult, and many people are suffering, so it is definitely not appropriate to be extravagant. This is why I dare not agree with the world in commemorating my mother's 70th birthday.

### Reason for the Assassination of Tram Inspector Chen Guohua

Diligent Exposure of Ticket Sellers' Embezzlement Leads to Accumulated Hatred and Tragic Death. More Than 20 Accomplices Arrested

Chen Guohua, a ticket inspector of the French Tram Company No. 5, a native of Zhabei, was shot and killed on the afternoon of the 25th at the intersection of Avenue du Père Robert and Rue Massenet. The details have been reported in this newspaper. According to a report from the China News Agency reporter, after the incident, in addition to the murderer Lu Rucheng being wounded and captured on the spot, Lv Tiancheng (mistakenly reported as Li Tiancheng yesterday), a ticket seller of No. 304, and Wang Yongqing, a ticket seller of No. 276, were also arrested. The police have found that dozens of people are involved in the case, most of whom are ticket sellers of the tram company. As of yesterday, a total of 25 people have been arrested. It is also learned that the main criminals in the case, ticket sellers No. 177 and No. 158, have fled after hearing the news and are now being hunted. It is also rumored that the reason for the bloodshed was entirely because Chen was diligent in his work and, when checking tickets, exposed the fraudulent tickets of as many as 60 people in one day. He reported them to the company, without any leniency. The company promoted him to his current position because of his loyalty, but at the same time, it also led to deep hatred and tragic death. It is rumored that the murderer of the bloodshed obtained a large sum of money, which was contributed by the accomplices in the case, each paying five yuan, and signing their names in a notebook. Therefore, the police authorities were able to solve the case quickly.

### Summary of Important News

Later, because China Bank's appetite was quite strong, the spot US dollar reached 6.09375 yuan. However, at noon, foreign firms traded the spot US dollar again at 6.125 yuan, and foreign firms' selling intentions were strong. The noon closing was still hard, with British gold at 3 shillings 9.0625 pence and the US dollar at 6.125 yuan, which were 0.03125 pence and 0.09375 yuan higher than the morning opening for British gold and the US dollar, respectively.

China Bank Changes from Buying to Selling

The market situation in the afternoon was even harder, as speculators continued to sell. China Bank also turned from buying to selling. The June US dollar was sold by speculators to foreign firms at 6.15625 yuan and 6.1875 yuan. The July US dollar was sold by China Bank to foreign firms at 6.125 yuan. Later, foreign firms traded the June US dollar at 6.21875 yuan. However, it softened slightly before the close. China Bank sold to speculators in Shanghai for 6.1875 yuan. As a result, British gold was 3 shillings 9.375 pence, the US dollar was 6.1875 yuan, the July British gold was 3 shillings 9.0625 pence, and the July US dollar was 6.09375 yuan, which were 0.0625 pence higher for both spot and futures British gold and 0.15625 yuan harder for the US dollar compared to yesterday's close.

### Gold Market's Downturn Intensifies

Yesterday's spot gold market, in both official and unofficial trading, showed a flat and weak trend. Although there were some minor fluctuations, the number of rises and falls was still small. More selling than buying among operators was influenced by a certain atmosphere in the market, and the loose foreign exchange quotations made it even more difficult for prices to rise. The morning opening was 5,500 yuan, but it fell to 5,420 yuan due to initial selling by both gold and silver firms. Some retail investors had the urge to buy at low prices, and the price was briefly pulled up by 50 yuan. Ultimately, due to selling pressure from money changers, it fell back down again. The noon closing was 5,430 yuan. The sentiment was poor when the market opened in the afternoon. Silver firms once absorbed an opening price of 5,410 yuan, reversing up 20 yuan. Subsequently, gold firms, money changers, and retail investors unanimously took action to liquidate their positions for the day, resulting in a disastrous drop below the 5,400 yuan mark before the close, reaching a low price of 5,350 yuan. The closing price was ultimately 5,400 yuan, still 100 yuan lower than the previous day. The total transaction volume was about 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold was quoted 10 yuan lower by silver shops, while customs gold remained flat.

Spot Gold Dropped by 100 Yuan Yesterday

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially showed a stable situation due to flat foreign exchange quotations. The opening price was no different from the previous day. Silver firms traded with each other at 5,500 yuan. Subsequently, due to competitive selling by silver firms, gold firms also followed suit and sold aggressively. At the same time, the foreign exchange market was hardening, and there was a lack of buyers, resulting in a price drop of 80 yuan. Gold firms sold 20 taels to silver firms at a price of 5,420 yuan. Then, with support from securities firms, money changers, and retail investors, the price briefly recovered by 50 yuan. Silver firms bought 30 taels from gold firms at 5,470 yuan. Ultimately, due to the continued loosening trend of foreign exchange, there were many sellers at high prices. One silver firm in particular exerted a strong selling force, pushing the price down another 55 yuan. Money changers traded 10 taels at 5,415 yuan. Selling pressure eased slightly before the close, and the price rose again by 15 yuan. Money changers bought 10 taels from gold firms at 5,430 yuan, which was the closing price for the noon session. The market was quite weak when it opened in the afternoon, dropping by 20 yuan. Securities firms sold 10 taels to money changers, retreating to 5,410 yuan. Subsequently, silver firms bought in, reversing up 20 yuan. Silver firms bought 20 taels from securities firms at 5,430 yuan. Later, the hardening of the foreign exchange market triggered selling pressure. Gold firms and money changers sold to each other, and long positions in silver firms were also liquidated, resulting in another drop of 80 yuan. Silver firms sold 20 taels to money changers at 5,350 yuan. After that, the number of sellers decreased, and one silver firm showed strong buying interest, again increasing its absorption. Gold firms sold 20 taels to silver firms at 5,410 yuan. Later, securities firms sold 30 taels to silver firms and others, retreating again to 5,400 yuan, the evening closing price. As a result, the price dropped by 100 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 150 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold for gold firms' own brand was several tens of yuan higher than the spot gold price, while the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current gold standard price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there was little trading.

Jewelry Gold Traded at 550 Yuan

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops was initially 560 yuan at Dahantong, but at 3:15 PM, it was reduced by 10 yuan. Dahantong changed its quote to 550 yuan. The new colleagues' selling price was the same as before. The buying price was reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Decline

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot gold fluctuating downward. British gold pounds and American gold pounds also fell by 3 yuan each. British gold notes fell by 0.3 yuan due to the loosening of the black market British exchange rate and a slight increase in supply. American gold notes fell due to the rise in the black market American exchange rate. The public rushed to sell, and the market price fell, once retreating to 16.25 yuan. Eventually, it recovered slightly to 16.3 yuan, still 0.27 yuan lower than the previous day. Hong Kong notes fell and then rose, ultimately continuing to rise by 0.02 yuan. Canadian notes and Philippine notes were still plentiful in supply, and the market price uniformly continued to weaken. Demand for Japanese gold notes did not decrease, and the evening price was 1.1 yuan. The supply and demand for Korean notes were balanced, and the evening price was still 0.975 yuan.

### Tomorrow is the Banks' Half-Year Settlement; Check Clearing Extended

The Shanghai Banking Association Clearing Committee yesterday issued a circular to all clearing banks, stating, "It has been verified that June 29 (Saturday) is the date for the banking industry's half-year settlement. In order to facilitate the collection and transfer of funds by fellow banks, the clearing time on this day will be appropriately extended, set from 4:45 PM. The time for collecting checks will remain the same." According to the original clearing time, it was 3:30 PM, which is a delay of one hour and fifteen minutes.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Market Turns Around; Type C Breaks Through the 50 Yuan Mark; British Bank Shares Continue to Fall

Yesterday's off-market trading of securities saw a sudden rise in market prices. A certain bank bought hundreds of thousands, suddenly making the weak debt market shake. A certain atmosphere was strong, and trading also increased sharply. The market's chips suddenly appeared depleted. General retail investors were quite short covering, but large short positions remained unmoved. This kind of price rise was mostly due to the upcoming interest payment and the banks' half-year settlement. The so-called certain atmosphere was still just speculation. Yesterday morning, Yongfenghao bought about 300,000 of Types C and E on behalf of a certain bank, and the market sentiment suddenly strengthened. Type E lacked strength due to the emergence of the 20th day bulls. Yongkang supplied 100,000 of Type A, which was absorbed by Lemao. The remaining Lienyi and the 16th showed some demand and were sold by Lianhe. In the afternoon, Types C and E were traded more, so the price rise suddenly became strong. Type A had the fewest sellers, so the price rise was also strong. The market price had broken through 61 yuan. Type C also broke through the 50 yuan mark, and the situation was very good, but it was impossible to predict whether it would continue. The market price results, except for Type D, which was still not opened, the rest all rose by 0.2 to 0.35 yuan. The transaction volume was more than 1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock Trading: 30 shares of Kangyuan Canning Factory stock were traded at a price of 9 yuan per share. According to this type of stock, the face value is 10 yuan.

The operators' interest in the stock market of the Public Association of Various Industries was still very weak. The price changes were minimal, and the transaction volume was scarce.

London, 26th (Wednesday) - Today's listed prices for Far East British companies' stocks saw bank shares continue to fall. The rest remained flat. Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China shares continued to fall by 2 shillings and 6 pence, with a price of 6 pounds. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation shares fell sharply by 5 pounds, with the London registered shares at 55 pounds and the Hong Kong registered shares at 60 pounds. The Mercantile Bank of India shares fell by 5 shillings, with a price of 11 pounds and 5 shillings.

London, 26th (Wednesday) - Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt remained stable. There were no changes in the prices of any of the bonds.

### Yarn and Cotton: Difficult to Support Alone; Yarn Prices Plummet; Shuangma at a Low of 885 Yuan

The yarn market initially remained flat and then fell. The trend was still weak. This was because actual sales were not smooth, and Shanghai's transportation was still difficult. Therefore, the Hong Kong gangs were unable to do anything, and morale was low. Therefore, although the Shenxin Factory was doing its best to maintain the market and continued to buy, there were very many sellers. The factory, in view of its inability to support the building alone, stopped buying. As a result, the limit price of 950 yuan fell directly to 885 yuan. Then, with some buying, it returned to the edge of 900 yuan.

The morning opening of the spot yarn market saw that morale was already scattered. There were more sellers than buyers. The asking price for 20-count Shuangma was 947 yuan, and everyone held their ground without making a deal. Shortly after, someone from the Shenxin Factory called out 950 yuan for buying in the market. As a result, sellers came one after another, with quantities of more than 50 bales. The factory saw that the chips on the table were full and stopped buying. Retail investors sold out, and the market price dropped, falling to 865 yuan. However, the closing price was slightly higher as someone bought in, and it rose back to 900 yuan. According to the statistics of transactions during the half-day, 2,240 bales were traded. The Shuangma price fell by 66 yuan. Today, 283 pieces of yarn were shipped to Yantai, 105 pieces were shipped to Tianjin, and 10 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each gang is listed below.

### Cotton: Japanese Factories Slightly Active

The spot cotton market has completely entered a standstill. The reason is that the yarn market has fallen sharply, causing factories to wait and see. Therefore, there are no transactions in this cotton market. However, there is a group that is extremely willing to concede a sharp drop, but there are few buyers.

In other news, the spot price of foreign cotton saw the New York cotton market was very firm and exceptionally active. Spot traders and Wall Street purchases resulted in closing prices that were 19 points higher for near-term and 10 points higher for far-term compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market, along with forecasts, did not fluctuate much.

The trade of foreign cotton in Shanghai was very quiet among Chinese manufacturers. However, Japanese factories were very active. Yesterday, they purchased more than 1,000 bales of spot cotton, but the payment period was mostly at the end of July, which was due to the high price of Japanese yarn and the active sales of yarn. The industry's intentions have therefore turned for the better.

Another large batch of Indian cotton has arrived in Shanghai. The former Yajiya Shipping Company's Sassiya (transliteration) ship arrived in port the day before yesterday, carrying 6,000 pieces of cotton from Calcutta, and docked at Qichang Pier in Pudong to unload.

### The Demise of the Golden Age of Yarn Factories

— Island Guest

Everyone knows that nearly two months ago, the highest peak of 20-count yarn was 1,800 to 1,900 yuan (a record-breaking new record per piece). Speculators desperately pushed up yarn prices, thinking that having a few pieces of yarn in their hands meant they could be carefree and powerful, with the prospect of eating endlessly for life, and even less worry about becoming a wealthy person. They were making sacrifices for the yarn factories and creating opportunities for the yarn factory industry to make huge profits. When the market price was 1,800 to 1,900 yuan and 1,600 to 1,700 yuan, the total cost of raw materials and expenses for yarn factories was only about 1,000 yuan (this refers to Shuangma yarn, and other yarns were not much different). So, didn't each piece of yarn have a huge profit of 800 to 900 yuan or 600 to 700 yuan? However, that opportunity for huge profits passed like lightning! In mid-May, foreign exchange rose sharply, and unfavorable news about the Allied forces in the European war came frequently. Telegraphs about Indian cotton and American cotton showed a sharp decline (benefiting short sellers' overseas long selling). As a result, the Shanghai yarn market went from 1,400 to 1,500 yuan, to 1,200 to 1,300 yuan, to about 1,100 yuan, and... yesterday (the 27th) it fell again and again due to the bad news that coastal defense could not be transferred, initially opening at 950 yuan for Shuangma yarn, then falling to 850 to 860 yuan, and finally closing at 880 yuan after a small rebound. Each fall was always close to 100 yuan. Although a certain large yarn factory launched a strong force and bought 3,000 to 4,000 bales of Shuangma yarn to maintain the market price (this shows the seriousness of the yarn factory's internal panic), the eyes of those experienced in the business world, under the realistic environment, can always see more falling than rising, benefiting short positions rather than long positions. Moreover, in reality, sales to Hong Kong and other groups are pitiful (only 100 to 200 bales per day). According to a certain gentleman who goes to the yarn market every day, the miracle in the market yesterday (the 27th) was that the Hong Kong gangs not only did not buy in, but continued to sell. Thus, the foothold of yarn prices and the future of the yarn market can be imagined!

According to the current yarn price of 800 yuan, yarn factories will lose as much as 200 yuan per piece. The raw material for yarn factories—cotton—has mostly been purchased in advance (bought when it was expensive). The cost of raw materials for each load of 20-count yarn must be about 230 to 240 yuan. Calculating 350 jin of cotton per piece, the cost of raw materials alone is 830 to 40 yuan, plus at least 170 to 180 yuan for the expenses of each piece. The sum of these two items means that the manufacturing cost is more than 1,000 yuan. If a large yarn factory produces 200 pieces of yarn (20-count) every day and night, it will lose about 30,000 yuan. If this trend of falling yarn prices lasts for a month, a large-scale yarn factory with a large public reserve fund may still be able to cope with a monthly loss of 1 million yuan? (Perhaps it will also feel stretched?) As for many small-scale yarn factories, they can only close down. According to a certain gentleman who told me, a certain large yarn factory has already lost as much as 5 million yuan in the sharp drop in raw materials (cotton) and market prices. The number of yarn firms going bankrupt and liquidating at the end of this month will probably be even more shocking!

### Grain: Hoarders Emerge, Rice Prices Continue to Fall by Approximately One Yuan

Yesterday, when the rice market initially opened, sellers, having been left in a lurch from the previous dynasty, were unwilling to easily let go. Supported by price maintenance, the situation was relatively firm, and the prices of various types of foreign rice were once raised by more than half a yuan. However, sales were sluggish. In addition to the halt of purchases by inland merchants, there were few inquiries from rural villages and local streets, causing prices to quickly return to stability. Moreover, many floating hoarders and small-scale speculators had no intention of holding on, and quite a few emerged to sell. This was compounded by the arrival of 15,000 to 16,000 bags of new rice, and various pre-arranged batches were also about to arrive in Shanghai. Meanwhile, local consumption was weak, and inland merchants were about to fulfill their quotas using transportation permits. New permits were expensive, making transportation unprofitable. Additionally, the continuous rainfall had calmed people's minds, and inland rice prices had already started to decline. New hoarders also dared not absorb more rice. Although some trading firms remained determined to hold on, the trend suggested that the market would be forced to decline. Yesterday, the selling prices of all types of rice uniformly decreased. No. 2 Saigon rice initially opened at 61 yuan in the morning market but closed at only 60 yuan and 2.5 jiao in the evening. No. 2 Siam rice was initially 60 yuan and 5 fen in the morning but 59 yuan and 5 jiao in the evening. Small-kernel rice was initially 60 yuan and 3 jiao in the morning but 59 yuan and 4 jiao in the evening. All were about one yuan lower than the previous evening. Trading in repossessed goods halted. 150 tons of repossessed No. 2 Siam rice, packed on the 18th, were offered at prices ranging from 67 yuan and 5 jiao to 67 yuan and 3 jiao. More than 5,000 bags of spot rice were offered.

Due to the all-day rain the day before, there were no arrivals of Japonica and glutinous domestic rice. On the sales side, whether openly or secretly, rumors indicated poor sales. However, sellers remained firm due to the lack of arrivals, resulting in the same selling prices as before.

### Flour Only Sold Locally; Wheat Prices Drop Due to Rain

Flour trading was quite active, but only for small-scale local sales. This was because rice prices were currently high, and the demand from ordinary people was increasing. The sliced noodle industry association requested an increase in supply, and it is reported that the factories have accepted. Throughout the day, the two factories distributed a total of 14,000 to 15,000 bags. The price of No. 2 flour from the factories continued to be 14 yuan and 7 jiao, while repossessed flour was priced at 15 yuan and 4 or 5 jiao. Future flour from Japanese factories had been offered at over 16 yuan and 6 jiao. Furthermore, 1,200 bags of flour were being shipped to Yantai today.

The source of new wheat continued with three to four thousand bags being transported from the Beijing-Wuhu area, but these were not formally imported goods. The transportation issues for Chinese merchants have not yet been effectively resolved. However, after the rainfall, although the production price has been reported as slightly lower, the miscellaneous fees and taxes have increased, so the price of new wheat still needs to be above 23 yuan and 5 jiao to 24 yuan. It is also heard that the Fufeng factory purchased five to six hundred bags of Zhenjiang wheat at a price of 24 yuan and 3 jiao.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Supply Dries Up; Bean Cakes Become More Popular

Yesterday, the bean cake market, although initially facing transportation difficulties due to the morning rain, still saw brisk sales. Therefore, there were no significant changes in the market. Later, trading firms learned that the supply of soybeans was extremely scarce and that new supplies were not arriving. As a result, they tried their best to bring in supplies, making the market even more lively. As a result, prices jumped another 3 jiao. However, due to the shortage of spot goods, most transactions were for future delivery. The factories, anticipating future high prices of 14 to 15 yuan, dared not oversupply. Yesterday, the total transaction volume was 14,000 to 15,000 cakes of Dayou brand bean cake, with spot prices at 13 yuan and 5 or 6 jiao and delivery in the first half of July priced at 13 yuan and 3 to 6 jiao. 5,000 cakes of Shengji brand were traded, with spot prices at 12 yuan and 9 jiao to 13 yuan, and July delivery at 13 yuan and 1 jiao. Eight cartloads of Yuanlong brand cakes were traded, with spot prices at 12 yuan and 7 jiao to 13 yuan, and July delivery also at 13 yuan. Seven cartloads of Feizi brand cakes were traded, with spot prices at 13 yuan and July delivery at 13 yuan and 1 jiao, and 1,000 cakes of Qingzhong brand were traded at 12 yuan and 1.5 jiao.

Yesterday, 1,852 tins of raw oil and 280 pieces arrived from Yantai, and 200 pieces came from Qingdao. Today, 500 tins of raw oil, 2,000 pieces of bean cake, and 795 bags of beans were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Piece Goods: Southwest Transportation Disrupted, Cotton Cloth Sales Suddenly Clear

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw initial stability followed by declines due to weak sentiment. Actual sales were relatively strong in local streets and various guerrilla areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Sales to the southwestern Guangdong and Yunnan areas sharply decreased. The selling prices of coarse and fine cloth and twill fell by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per bolt, and bleached and dyed cloth also fell by about 1 yuan. Merchants from the Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Taizhou areas purchased over one hundred pieces of coarse twill colored cloth. Guerrilla areas in Jiangsu, Hangzhou, Anhui, and northern and southern regions purchased over ten thousand bolts of blue cloth, coarse cloth, colored twill, and other goods. Local merchants purchased over twenty thousand bolts of various grey fabrics and bleached and dyed cloths. Hoarders also absorbed some when prices were low.

Eastern cloth prices continued to fall, and sentiment became even weaker. Sellers were eager to sell, but buyers were scarce. Therefore, high-quality Longtou fine cloth initially opened at 31 yuan and 3 jiao in the morning but quickly fell to 30 yuan and 5 fen. Later, outside the market, prices started at 30 yuan, then plummeted to 28 yuan and 7.5 jiao. The ups and downs were large, with small rebounds in between, and the situation was still difficult to stabilize. Sijunzi serge once rose to 9 jiao, but ultimately fell back to 8 jiao, 4 fen and 5 li at the close due to sluggish actual sales.

Another report indicated that the recent sluggish sales of piece goods and cotton yarn to merchants were due to news from the shipping industry that merchants from the Beiyang region were stagnant because the Japanese puppet government in Tianjin would implement control over the import of piece goods and cotton yarn starting on July 1. Merchants from the Nanhua region, seeing the tense situation regarding Vietnam, had all stopped purchasing. As a result, exports had significantly decreased.

Today, 228 pieces of piece goods were exported to Yantai, 48 pieces were exported to Tianjin, and 17 pieces were exported to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Loosens

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was weak and showed signs of decline. The guild's benchmark price for spot 24 coarse white sugar was initially 68 yuan and 5 jiao to 2 jiao at foreign firms, but later fell slightly to 68 yuan, a drop of 6 jiao in total. Transshipment for delivery on July 2 was 54 yuan and 9 jiao to 55 yuan and 3 jiao, while ready-made documents were 54 yuan and 5 jiao to 2 jiao. Taikoo Caster White was relatively cheaper, with B mark still at 79 yuan and 5 jiao and Dutch Red at 59 yuan and 4 jiao. For domestic sugar, merchants from Guangdong offered 70 bags of high-quality Hainan Red at 51 yuan and 5 jiao, but there were few transactions.

### Qian Hu Arrives in Shanghai

Qian Hu is produced in the mountains bordering Zhejiang and Anhui provinces and is an essential medicine for treating illnesses in the summer and autumn. Last winter, due to weather and human factors, production was only half of that in previous years, making harvesting and transportation very difficult. It is reported that Yuji Shenzhuang on Baike Road sent personnel to the production area in the spring and secured seventy to eighty percent of the total amount. The first two batches have already been shipped to Hong Kong and resold to the South Seas Islands. Various grades of spot goods have now arrived in warehouses and are awaiting sale.

Old News Newly Copied 67 Years Ago (428) (See This Newspaper from the 12th Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Late Qing Dynasty)

### Korean Ginseng

After Korea became a vassal of our dynasty, it was stipulated that they would offer tributes three times every year for internal affairs and five times for external affairs. Later, due to the frequent travels, it was ordered that the tributes be combined into one. When they came to the capital, there were eight envoys, with the head being the tribute envoy, and the rest were named from Two Great Officials to Eight Great Officials, probably the deputy envoy and accompanying personnel. In addition to the tribute goods, the main item traded with China was Korean ginseng, each package weighing about ten catties. They were only allowed to trade with the six major firms in the capital, and these six firms would then distribute them to pharmacies in various provinces, prefectures, and counties. Chinese merchants and civilians were not allowed to trade privately, and even Korean merchants and civilians were not allowed to bring ginseng out of customs privately. After the ginseng was handed over to the six major firms, no payment was received immediately. Instead, there was a separate list for these six firms to purchase Chinese silk, satin, gauze, and writing materials. The accounts would be reconciled when the Korean envoys came to the capital the following year. This was the old practice. Last year, the Governor-General of Zhili reported that Korean merchants were selling ginseng after entering the country. The Ministry then investigated and found that although Korean tribute envoys were exempt from taxes on all goods they brought, they should only trade at the Bureau of Translators, etc., and were not allowed to sell in the interior. However, if border residents impersonated Koreans, local officials should investigate and deal with them. If they were indeed followers of the tribute envoys who were loitering in the interior, they should be sent to the Ministry and then to their home country for investigation.

Spring and Autumn

### Key Points for Further Education - A Contribution to High School Graduates -

— Qian Jiajun

Last Wednesday afternoon, I went to the YWCA on Jing'an Temple Road to listen to a two-hour lecture on guidance for further education. The lecture was given by Mr. Wang, the Dean of Academics at Soochow University, whose well-organized explanation was indeed very helpful in terms of our choices for further education. I feel that this series of lectures on further education organized by the YWCA is like a beacon for us high school graduates, guiding each of us on the path we should take. However, recently, most graduates of various schools are preparing for graduation exams, and due to time constraints, some may not be able to attend the lectures. Therefore, I will write down the general points Mr. Wang made below for the reference of students from various schools who were unable to attend.

"Before the arrival of summer vacation, middle schools usually guide students on the issue of further education after graduation, just like choosing a suitable husband (i.e., a university) for a daughter who is about to be married. Now you are about to leave your mother's home, and at the same time, we university authorities are also busy preparing to welcome you, a group of new brides." At the beginning, Mr. Wang used this humorous metaphor to highlight the importance of guidance for further education. Then, he divided the following into four points to explain:

(1) Learning Skills Needed by Society

No one will deny that the day China achieves final victory will also be the day construction begins; in other words, a new China must be built from the ashes of the war. At that time, a large number of technical personnel will be urgently needed. Therefore, the best subjects to choose to study are skills that are more needed by society. Then, whether speaking from the perspective of personal prospects or national interests, it is a win-win situation.

(2) Matching One's Intelligence and Interests

Precisely because of the need for construction talents, most young students, in order to be able to serve the country more actively in the future, are filled with the cry of "applying for science and engineering subjects." However, some people simply don't realize that their teaching often gets a Zero mark, or that they are used to "duck eggs" in physics. Even if they manage to get in, they will feel overwhelmed after studying for a semester and will switch departments. This kind of trouble is the result of erroneous ideas, because other subjects such as literature, law, and business also have their own values. As long as they match one's talents and interests, there will definitely be satisfactory results, which is much better than "forcing a cow to eat horse grass."

(3) Choosing a Department at a School

In the United States, experts have thoroughly investigated universities across the country and created statistical tables showing which departments at each school are the best and which are worse, so that those preparing to apply to universities can understand at a glance. China does not yet have such statistics. Now, we can only rely on our own investigation, and we must not adopt the principle of haphazardly taking exams and belittle this important issue.

(4) Paying Attention to the School's Environment and Atmosphere

The environment is the shell of the school; the school atmosphere is the soul of the school. Because the school is where students train their intellect, exercise their physique, and cultivate their personality, it must have a good environment in order to have a better education. Regarding the school atmosphere, for example, whether the feelings among students are harmonious, and whether teachers and staff work together with students in harmony, these can all affect students' studies.

Other things, such as whether the school is registered; what the prospects of previous graduates are; and the equipment in the school, etc., Mr. Wang guided in detail one by one. Due to space constraints, I will not write much here. Finally, I hope that all students will be successful in their applications.

### Nine Prohibitions for Seeking Employment

— Liang

When you are summoned by the shop owner you have longed to meet for a long time to talk, you must remember to pay attention to the following nine points:

(1) Do not show a panicked or extremely flustered appearance.

(2) The volume of your speech does not need to be too high, nor should it be too fast, so as not to disturb your composure.

(3) Do not tell him all of your difficulties completely.

(4) Do not talk about irrelevant idle talk.

(5) Do not speak in too much detail, so as not to arouse the other party's disgust.

(6) Do not ask some confused questions.

(7) Do not say to the shop owner, "I will definitely work hard."

(8) Do not say to the shop owner that if he hires you, he will get great benefits.

(9) Do not try to control the other party. (Translated from World Digest, March-April issue)

### Exploiters in the Midst of "Daylight Saving Time"

Mr. Editor:

I am a worker at the ×× Weaving and Dyeing Factory. I go to work at six o'clock every morning and leave work at six o'clock in the afternoon, working a full twelve hours every day. The price I get is at most nine corners a day. Just think, in this metropolis where everything is skyrocketing, after deducting five corners for food and the necessary miscellaneous expenses, how much is left?

Recently, because the market feels a little sluggish, the factory has stopped night work, and a notice dismissed more than thirty male and female workers, adding a new batch of unemployed people to society. I am fortunate that I have not been laid off, but all the harsh treatments are enough to endure.

From June 1st, various places are following daylight saving time. Our factory cannot be an exception. Originally, twelve hours of animalistic work was already hard enough, but now we have to add another hour of work for no reason, to do thirteen hours of work. Mr. Editor, is this what is called the principle of implementing daylight saving time? Therefore, I am using your publication to expose this, hoping that the capitalists will take into account the health and lives of us workers, and save our suffering masses!

(Editor's Note: After the implementation of the new clock time on the first of this month, we received a letter from a reader who believes that this "movement" has no meaning at all, except to benefit the second landlords. His example is: the second landlord has turned off the lights at twelve o'clock according to the new clock time. Regarding the meaning of the "daylight saving time" movement, several authors in this publication have already expressed their opinions, so I will not repeat them. The big second landlords in this city are truly ubiquitous after the war, and they will naturally not easily let go of this excellent opportunity. However, the evening is the time for sleep, and turning off the lights one hour earlier is not as harmful to the third tenants as raising the rent, so that letter was not published. But yesterday, we received another letter from a worker who said that the owner of the weaving and dyeing factory where he works is also taking this opportunity to increase the working hours of the workers. This not only does not conform to the true meaning of the authorities' promotion of the "daylight saving time" movement, but is actually engaged in exploiting the workers' rest time, which is really too "that." The publication of this letter is obviously of no help to the workers, but humans who have life are always equipped with the empathy that humans should have. In case it has a subtle effect, I wish the factory good business on behalf of all the workers.)

Hawthorne Detective Cases

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Two "A Page of History!"

Hawthorne nodded again. "What happened after you got out of bed?"

"I immediately put on a coat and went to knock on Mr. Li's door in the next room. He was also awakened. He opened the door, and I accompanied him downstairs. As soon as we walked into this reception room, we saw Miss Wang in this terrible state." Her gaze once again made contact with the corpse.

Hawthorne took the cigarette out of his mouth and asked, "At that time, was the door of this reception room open or closed?"

"Open. Because I remember that as soon as I walked downstairs, I saw the light here shining on the corridor outside."

"What about this window?" He pointed to the steel bar window in front of the desk with his hand.

"Also open, still like this."

"Okay, what happened next?"

"Mr. Li panicked and said he wanted to call the police station. I had no idea either. At that time, the gatekeeper, Old Mao, also came in from outside with a coat on. He stood on the stone steps at the main entrance and suddenly shouted loudly!"

"Shouted what?"

"He shouted 'Footprints! Footprints!' I followed Mr. Li back to the outer corridor and saw that Old Mao had turned on the light at the main entrance and was pointing at the mud footprints on the floor inside the door in a daze. Mr. Li called Old Mao in. He shook his head first and refused, then he went back to the gatehouse to get a few planks and laid them on top of the footprints before carefully walking in step by step from the wooden planks."

Ni Jinshou, who had been silently writing in his notebook, seemed to be unable to bear the silence anymore when he heard this. He stopped writing and said to himself, "Strange, how could Old Mao see these mud footprints as so important?"

Jinmei suddenly answered automatically. "He probably already knew that Miss Wang had been beaten to death. Because when Mr. Li walked in, he would shout in panic: 'Oh! Who beat her to death? Who beat her to death?' Old Mao must have heard it outside."

Hawthorne didn't make any criticism, but urged Jinmei to continue. (28)

### Shaoxing Correspondence

— Zhuchang

Brother ××: This is indeed a tragic scene. Since the fall of Xiaoshan, our hometown has also been ravaged by invaders once. Although it was only a fleeting moment, the traffic on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was cut off as a result, and the source of rice and grain gradually became scarce. Shaoxing, which originally relied on imported rice and grain as its staple food, naturally did not have enough local production to meet the needs of the people. As a result, the price of rice rose again and again, until it reached one hundred and ten yuan per stone. Now the people have no means of living, and more and more people are starving to death. In addition, there has been no rain for several months, the riverbeds are dry, the fields are cracked, and epidemics are rampant as a result. The residents are all haggard and miserable. News of deaths among neighbors is now an indispensable part of the daily news. If you come back now, you will definitely suspect that this is no longer the former hometown: the beautiful scenery of Jian Lake, the calm Lake Hu, have become a gathering place for tears of hunger; the Orchid Pavilion at the foot of Mount Kuaiji is no longer the solemn and gorgeous scenic spot it once was. Their surroundings seem to be covered with a layer of dark clouds of sorrow. I never thought that this former garden where King Yue endured hardship to achieve his goal would turn into a hell on earth. Recently, I heard that enthusiastic gentlemen in the Shen area are running around to solicit donations for their hometown. The compatriots here are extremely excited, and the pitiful scene of them eagerly awaiting is truly heartbreaking. I hope that the Yue people in Shanghai will quickly rise up to provide emergency relief.

Arts and Entertainment World

### The Trend of Future Movies - Color Films Prevail, Black and White Films Eliminated

— Xinfang

In recent years, due to the increasing production of color films, we can know that in the future history of film, black and white films will be eliminated again, which is undoubtedly true. The larger film companies in Hollywood are all concentrating their full strength on producing various color films. No matter whether those films have ordinary content or a structure that is not compact, smart film merchants have unanimously recognized that if they are rendered with color, they are more likely to cater to the psychology of the audience than if only black and white images are shown on the screen.

At the beginning, when the film industry progressed from the silent era to the sound era, of course, a group of people were unearthed, but another group of people disappeared from the screen as a result. In the future, when the position of black and white films is replaced by color films, the same encounter will definitely occur. Now, the general stars in Hollywood are already feeling fear because of this issue; they or she are all worried about whether their position has been shaken by this trend?

In fact, the situation mentioned above has already been heard in Hollywood. Everyone has admitted that the relationship between shooting color films and the skin of the actors is extremely large; in addition, there is another argument that actors with brown skin are more suitable for shooting color films than those with white skin. Paramount Pictures plans to shoot a total of five color films this year, four of which will be starred by actors with brown skin, and the other one is "Northwest Mounted Police" directed by Cecil B. DeMille, the protagonist of which is Madeleine Carroll, who is a white-skinned star.

The period when color films occupy the entire film industry is not far from today. Therefore, public opinion in all walks of life is also predicting that there will be a major change in the film industry soon, so let us wait and see. Finally, let me talk a few words about the film washing work. It is said that black films use a brownish-yellow liquid and powder; the amount used is extremely large, but it will never cause damage to the film itself; color films use another kind of gray powder, and can only use a small amount.

### Zhang Yipeng Improves Peking Opera

— Shen Qi

Zhang Yipeng, a young Peking Opera practitioner, has undergone a sudden change in his thinking since leaving the Grand Theater. He feels that in this great era, drama is not a simple form of entertainment, but should bear the cultural mission of its own. Therefore, he performs very solemnly with trepidation. In this year, he and his second younger brother, Erpeng, in addition to hiring Mr. Cheng Xiaoqing to teach Chinese studies to make up for his insufficient knowledge, have also worked hard on the Peking Opera improvement movement. For example, writing scripts is one of them. Currently, the play "Wen Tianxiang" has been completed, and he continues to collect information on "Lin Chong." According to him, in this transitional period, art should be given equal importance with ideology, because ideology can educate the audience, and art can strive for the audience's appreciation of the fun.

However, what he believes is the problem is whether the theater owner can accept his proposition? Therefore, he is temporarily retiring to his hometown, waiting for a place where he can manipulate everything backstage.

Recently, the Carlton is preparing to start its summer vacation from the 8th of next month, because the Yifeng Society is currently in the Carlton, and the front and back stages are indeed a unified plan. This is exactly in line with his ideal, so he wants to take advantage of their summer vacation period to prepare to rent it and perform his new Peking Opera play to test whether the audience can accept it. However, if the Carlton only takes a month's summer vacation, then he can only give up, because in any case, performing in this hot summer is bound to fail, and it should be at least after June to be able to perform.

### Brief News from the Art World

### Sons and Daughters of China Repeatedly Inspected in Hong Kong

The "Sons and Daughters of China" produced by the Central Film Studio contains four stories, writing about the various young men and women after the Anti-Japanese War, which is quite profound. It has been transported to the Soviet Union for screening and has won international honors. This film was shipped to Hong Kong last year. During the initial inspection by the Hong Kong government, it was considered that the last paragraph was too stimulating. As a result, it was completely cut off. Recently, a trailer was published, planning to be released to the public. Unexpectedly, the Hong Kong government ordered a re-inspection, and it is said that several places still need to be deleted. Therefore, the trailer on the newspaper has been suspended, and the screening period will be postponed again.

### Shouyun Huzhai Quhua Answers Questions on the Romance of the West Chamber Slang

— Lin Shaoqing

A few days ago, I talked about Qiu Hu teasing his wife in this publication, in which I explained the words in the song of Qiu Hu teasing his wife in the Yuan Dynasty, which aroused Mr. Dong's letter asking about the sentences in the Romance of the West Chamber. Mr. Dong had some points that he did not understand, and ordered me to explain them clearly. I am not smart, I only know a little about the words in Yuan songs, so I only list them according to the letter and answer them casually. I don't know if it is appropriate. 1. "Drawing a bow to entice fate" fate is the character for fate, this sentence comes from Jin Shengtan's general comments before the "Surprising Beauty" fold, which is Shengtan's learning to write Yuan people's language. "Drawing a bow" refers to Zhang Sheng. Nowadays, people say that the character Zhang is "bow long," and even today, the secret language of the northern Jianghu people calls those whose surname is Zhang "curved bow child." Its origin comes from the Yuan people's language "drawing a bow," which can be proven. Shengtan commented, "Drawing a bow to entice fate," saying that this other courtyard must be attached to the temple, so that Zhang Sheng can cleverly entice fate, because he can see Yingying by traveling to the temple. Because of this sentence, I had to look at the entire text of Jin's comments again before I found this sentence, which was a pain. 2. "Drawing a bow" sour old man, in the song of Hongniang in "In Front of the Hou," Mr. Dong dropped the word "old man." The two words "drawing a bow" are already clear, so now I will explain the two words "sour old man." The Yuan people called small children "old man child," and poor scholars were often called "sour Ding." "Sour Ding" is a general term for scholars who are either strong or old, and "sour old man" refers to young people. "Drawing a bow sour old man" can be explained in today's language as a poor sour kid from the Zhang family. 3. "Hawk-eyed old man" old man means eye, and today's northern Jianghu secret language calls eye "Zhaoer," which means the same; hawk-eyed is an adjective, describing eyes that are big and bright, and the eyes are double eyelids and beautiful, which is called hawk-eyed. Northerners still use these two words to praise women's beautiful eyes, but hawk's original sound is Hu, and today's northerners read it as tiger, which is slightly different. 4. "Sage fights," "fight" is the "fight up the oriole" fight. Liu Baoquan sang the drum war Changsha or the saber meeting, calling Guan Zhuangmiao the Sage Grandpa, and this sage is the same. The Yuan people called all immortals sages, not only Guan Gong, "Good teaching sage fights, Zhang Sheng hates the sun's late fall, should teach immortals like Hou Yi and the like, fight him down also; the word fight is to match the rhyme, the word sage is occasionally connected." 5. "The gauze window also has no Hongniang report," this sentence is easy to understand. I remember that Hongniang is Wuming, this is a pun, Wuming is exactly the same as a person's name, so it is used, borrowing what poem allusions, please Mr. Dong use his brain and check it out. Yuan songs are the mother of all operas, and many of the words in them are different from modern ones. I especially like to study them. Anyone who likes songs can put in some effort, and may be able to find many interesting things, such as archaeologists going to ancient Egyptian tombs and discovering the beautiful corpse of the "mummy," isn't it fun!
