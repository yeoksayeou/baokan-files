### Gruen Rebuts Matsuoka's Speech: US Determined to Uphold Obligations and Rights; Actions, Not Eloquent Words, Move People; American People in China Sympathize with China

Tokyo – US Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Gruen, recently delivered a speech warning Japan that the United States pays attention to actual actions, not empty words of peace. Before the US Ambassador's speech, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka spoke, emphasizing that the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan was by no means a weapon against the United States. Matsuoka also acknowledged that US-Japan relations were slightly strained, but said that patience and strategy might allow the two countries to overcome this difficulty. Matsuoka also emphasized that Nomura was not a career diplomat, but a man of great talent, and that the American people would recognize this new ambassador to the United States as a truly sincere Japanese and a turning point for restoring international trust. We must restore international mutual trust, which is what the world needs most at this time. Japan's dispatch of Nomura to the United States is enough to show the Japanese government's aspirations for US-Japan relations. Matsuoka then acknowledged that US-Japan relations were currently very bad, and the basic reason for this deterioration was the American misunderstanding of Japan's goals and intentions. After Matsuoka finished speaking, US Ambassador Gruen took the floor and first expressed his gratitude for Matsuoka's "forthright speech," stating that the US and Japan were in complete agreement on several key points, namely, that both the US and Japan hoped for peace, hoped to be calm arbiters, and hoped that Admiral Nomura's mission would improve US-Japan relations. However, there were still several points that had become points of contention between the US and Japan. I do not wish to bring them up specifically, but I think it is necessary to clearly tell the Japanese Foreign Minister that most of the American people in China sympathize with China. Gruen then issued a warning, saying that Japan's actions spoke louder than its words, and the United States would judge based on Japan's actions. The US Ambassador refuted many of the statements made by Matsuoka, and specifically pointed out that Matsuoka's statement that China's fate was a matter of sympathy for Americans, while for the Japanese it was an important issue concerning the survival of the Japanese Empire, was erroneous. Gruen continued, "I also note the Japanese Foreign Minister's statement that Japan's plans do not close doors to any country anywhere, and that Japan will never engage in conquest or aggression." Matsuoka has lived in the United States for a long time and must know the fact that Americans are peace-loving at heart, must deeply know that Americans have a strong determination regarding the issue of their rights and obligations, and also deeply know that Americans only recognize actual actions and facts, regardless of what kind of decoration is used to adorn the appearance of these facts.

Tokyo – The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Admiral Nomura, will travel to the puppet state of "Manchukuo" before going to the United States to take up his post. Today, the Japan Association held a banquet at the Imperial Hotel to see him off. US Ambassador to Japan, Gruen, was present. Gruen gave a welcoming speech, saying that Mr. Matsuoka's knowledge of the United States was very detailed. I dare to believe that Mr. Matsuoka, because of his close ties in the United States, must have personal feelings for our country, just as I do for Japan. When this kind of personal feeling exists, it can often exert its influence, even reaching international affairs. Mr. Matsuoka and I have talked to each other very sincerely and frankly, sometimes in writing, sometimes not. Because I believe that there is no need for old-fashioned courtesy between us, and I avoid using diplomatic tactics. Therefore, we both know each other's position very well on the cases that occur, and we agree or disagree on these cases, all based on a sincere and objective position. This kind of mutual freedom, applied to any discussion, can benefit both sides. In this turbulent international situation and the gloomy and chaotic autumn of the world, there are many events that need to be handled. The Foreign Minister has taken the time to attend today and address his colleagues, and this association is truly grateful.

Reports of Soviet Purchases of Military Supplies from the US

Washington – It was reported here yesterday that the Soviet Union has entered the US market and is making large purchases of important military supplies, especially copper and cotton. It is reported that the Soviet Union intends to resell these military supplies to Germany. The US Department of Agriculture and Commerce revealed that although the Soviet Union did not purchase US cotton in 1938 and 1939, nor did it purchase any in the first two months of this year's shipbuilding season, it did purchase 54,000 bales of US cotton in October, and 23,000 bales in the first 21 days of November. At the same time, the number of copper purchased by the Soviet Union is not yet clear, but reporters expect that when the news is announced, a large shipment will be seen to have arrived in the Soviet Union. (International News Agency, 19th)

Matsuoka's Speech

Foreign Minister Matsuoka then stood up and said that he was honored to be able to gather with friends who were dedicated to enhancing the understanding between Japan and the United States. Admiral Nomura's appointment to the United States has been through some twists and turns. I would like to tell you all that he initially resolutely declined, but after three months of entreaties and attacks, this strong-willed admiral finally succumbed. Our country's newspapers refer to Admiral Nomura as a "cannon." You should know that he is physically and mentally worthy of the name "cannon." I dare to say that if any conflict arises in the Pacific, he can certainly be a powerful cannon with a blade, and can shatter all the possibilities and potential of this conflict. But I must tell you that in the new order of our plans, there is no conquest, no oppression, no selfish exploitation. If Japan does such unjust things in the future, we will do our best to oppose them. No matter what kind of pressure is put on us, no matter who slanders us, we will not be led astray from our established course. Japan is truly a model of ideals. This model of ideals, transmitted from ancient times since the establishment of the empire to this day, aims to enable each country to occupy a considerable position in the world. In my view, our world seems to be too broad in politics and too narrow in economics. Economic activities that should spread throughout the world should not be subject to restrictive damage. As for our political power, it should be limited to the scope that is most important to us, and should not extend to the borders of other people. If regional peace can be ensured through regional understanding, then the whole world can enjoy universal peace. I have always held this ideal. For example, the recent Havana Conference attempted to protect the peace and order of the Western Hemisphere through regional cooperation. Matsuoka then said to Nomura, "You should know that every inch of this six-foot body is a true Japanese, but at the same time it is a tool of international trust and trustworthiness." We must restore trust in all countries, which is what the world urgently needs at this time. I believe that Admiral Nomura will be able to continue Mr. Horiuchi's work and perform his duties happily. Mr. Horiuchi, with the help of his kind-faced wife, has won the hearts of the Americans. I now take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to Mr. Horiuchi and his wife for their continuous efforts to promote friendship between the United States and Japan. The fundamental reason for the various tensions between the United States and Japan lies in the American misunderstanding of Japan's goals and aspirations. The United States and other places believe that Japan is currently engaged in an imperialistic and insatiable war of aggression against China. In fact, Japan is not like that. This is not a war of aggression, nor is it a greedy ambition. What we are engaged in now is a kind of moral crusade. We are now trying to establish justice, fairness, and mutual benefit, and start a new era of lasting peace and unlimited prosperity in Greater East Asia. We firmly believe that Japan has the mission of civilization and stability in Greater East Asia. A part of the American people, whether intentionally or unintentionally, misunderstands Japan's plans and accuses Japan of harboring hostility towards the United States. Nothing could be more unfounded or inaccurate than this. In fact, Japan never wants to be hostile to the United States, nor does it want to be hostile to any country. What we want is to maintain and even increase our friendship with all countries. On the one hand, we only want to be left alone so that we can carry out construction projects without interference. On the other hand, we want to see the end of the disputes in China and the wars in Europe as soon as possible, and that no other country will participate. Allowing it to be a powerful United States, now try to imagine, what would be the situation if the United States participated in the European War or had a conflict with Japan in the Pacific? If any of you present here have any human feelings or conscience, how can you not be horrified when you think about it?

Loyalty to the Axis

Regarding this point, I would like to make sure that no citizen of the United States harbors any doubts in their mind, that is, Japan will continue to be loyal to its allies in the Axis powers. Japan's future diplomatic policy will be based on the Tripartite Pact as its axis, just as the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was effective in the past. This statement does not contain any threats. It is a simple statement of honesty, issued to prevent any possible misunderstandings from occurring. Because if there are illusions about such events, it will be harmful and not beneficial to everyone. In short, the fate of China, in the eyes of Americans, is mostly an emotional event, while in the eyes of Japanese, it is truly a matter of utmost importance, because it concerns the survival of the Japanese Empire. We are confident, not hopeless, about the prospect of China restoring peace as soon as possible. When peace is restored in the future, the difficult situation that currently exists between the United States and Japan will naturally diminish. Regarding this point, the newly established regime in Nanjing can be seen as a precursor to a turning point. As Admiral Nomura departs, I wish him a pleasant period of successfully completing his mission of promoting mutual trust between Japan and the United States. The waves of the Pacific may rise high, but we hope that Admiral Nomura, with his ambition and courage, will guide us to the other shore, like a skilled sailor. We should know that although we only see a small sail swaying in the angry sea, this boat does not lose its balance because of its load. This load is what our eyes cannot see, that is, the spirit of the people of both countries to maintain their composure, judgment, and self-control, and the common sense to deal with the unprecedentedly terrifying world situation. We should keep our heads clear. We should not act rashly. We must plan before we act, because there is still plenty of room for maneuvering, so why rush? We should all be calm and not impatient. This is what I hope for.

Gruen's Speech

After Matsuoka finished speaking, US Ambassador Gruen, because of two points in his speech, namely, that Japan will always be loyal to its Axis allies and that American interests in China are mostly a matter of emotion, stood up again to speak, earnestly denying that American interests in China are mostly a matter of emotion, and said that he also agreed with Matsuoka's view of wanting calm judgment, but that what is truly valuable are facts and actions. As for the moving words that conceal actions, they are not worth paying attention to. Japan is loyal to the Axis, while the American people are determined to uphold their obligations and rights. Nomura also made a brief speech, stating his desire to promote friendship and maintain peace in the Pacific between the two countries that have no reason to argue. (Reuters, 19th)

Editorial

### Problematic Italy and France

The development of all human affairs is extremely difficult to follow a straight line, and twists and turns are commonplace. Today there is another sensational piece of news, which may be regarded as a sign of a possible sharp turn for the worse in the world situation; however, it may just be a twist. Even if it evolves from this sign, we can imagine that there will be many twists and turns in the future.

To put it calmly, we cannot talk about a sharp turn or a twist at the moment; because as far as the so-called world situation has reached this stage, has it really reached its peak in terms of becoming bigger and worse? In many ways, there are countless possibilities for it to become bigger and worse; if it continues to become bigger and worse, then in fact it is still far away from its peak; and the various aspects that have been alerted, prepared, planned, and even discussed in recent times are all about dealing with the bigger and worse, even its peak. However, the thinking of observing events and changes should not be walking a straight line with one's eyes closed. Just like Germany's eastern and western attacks, its momentum is like a broken bamboo, and it wins every battle. After it defeated France, which was known as the strongest in the world, it took advantage of the victory to attack Britain; but now it has at least proved that the blitzkrieg strategy cannot defeat Britain, and it has also proved that Britain's military strength has turned stronger and the situation has turned better, just like Italy's shock in Southern Europe, its ambition to swallow the Mediterranean Sea, cross the desert, break the British army, and drive straight into Egypt; it regarded Greece as withered wood, and boasted that it would be enough to finish it in three weeks; but now Greece is counterattacking and penetrating deep into Albania, and Britain is counterattacking and repeatedly breaking Libyan fortresses, killing and capturing tens of thousands. Germany's attack on Britain and Italy's entry into Egypt to attack Greece, how can we know that they are not the golden age of Germany and Italy's great victory and great benefit, and claiming to be the hegemon; from then on, it may not only be impossible to add to it, but also impossible to continue it. Looking back on the past afterwards, it is very possible that the power of Germany and Italy at that time was the actual peak. In short, it is still difficult to say whether the current stage of the world situation has not reached its peak or has passed its peak, that is, it is not allowed to make a conclusion hastily. This is what should be distinguished and recognized before delving into today's news.

The so-called sensational news of today. According to a Washington dispatch from the American International News Agency, it roughly says:

"Yesterday, officials here announced that the United States will urgently order its ambassadors to Italy and France to take up their posts immediately after their leave is over. It is revealed that Ambassador to Italy, Mr. Phillips, will return to Rome; Admiral Leahy will take up the post of new ambassador to France. It is believed that the US government may prepare to confer with the heads of state of Italy and France, and provide assistance to them, and may even put pressure on them to prevent the two countries from being over-controlled by Germany. Observers here point out that Italy and France are now in urgent need of food and other supplies. The US government may provide this food to Italy and France, and transport the supplies across the Atlantic. This declaration by the US government has caused a stir in diplomatic circles, which believe that since people in Rome feel disappointed due to military setbacks and the budding economic crisis, they would be happy to accept a cessation of hostilities. News from Turkey says that since Italy has a gradually tendency towards peace, a truce between Britain and Italy is "very possible". Diplomatic circles are studying this news together with the US government's declaration. Since France surrendered, the US ambassador to France has been vacant until now. The US government has sent Admiral Leahy to take up this post, and the relationship between the United States and the Vichy government will be further improved. It is generally believed that Laval is a tool in the hands of the Nazis. The recent reorganization of the French government seems to be Marshal Pétain using his power to subdue Laval, thus the US and French governments have aroused great trust."

In this telegram, there are few facts narrated and many opinions introduced: all that is said is possible, not inevitable. If the current "possibility" actually becomes "reality" in the future, then the world situation has in fact passed its peak; although there is no hope for a sharp turn for the better, it is an extremely important transformation; although it cannot be avoided from twists and turns, it is a sign that it is hopeful to be recovered. However, these are only assumptions at present.

Assuming that these have indeed become problems. As far as the problematic France and Italy are concerned, the angle of activity related to Italy is large, and the angle of activity related to France is small. The dismissal of Laval by the Vichy Head of State, Marshal Pétain, proves that Pétain is not entirely a German puppet and is at the mercy of others. Nor is it Laval's personal tool and is manipulated by him. Therefore, Britain, the United States, and other parties suddenly felt a good impression. The wars in Greece and North Africa have indeed had a profound impact on the overall world situation, and they must have a subtle effect on Pétain's psychology; therefore, Britain, the United States, and other parties have triggered expectations at close range. These impressions and expectations are not illusory. We should not regard this as the traditional optimism of Britain and the United States and regard it as laughable; however, as the general trend shows, if Germany has not encountered serious new difficulties and Italy itself has admitted its decisive failure, then no matter what Pétain's ambitions are, the role that Pétain is currently playing in fact cannot escape being a German puppet and a tool of the pro-German faction. That is, no matter what Pétain's psychology is now and in the future, what he thinks of Britain, what he thinks of the United States, no matter how the United States can help France, and who it sends to be stationed in France, Vichy still cannot avoid German pressure, let alone get rid of German control and help the transformation of the world situation. On the contrary, the more unfavorable the overall situation is to Germany and the more favorable it is to Britain, the more likely it is that Germany will tighten its grip on France, making Vichy a complete puppet and a complete tool, unable to move. How should the so-called France and the so-called Vichy be distinguished and recognized between the two? That is another question, but there is no doubt that the Vichy regime cannot exist without being pro-German at present. Therefore, although the United States has now regarded France as a problem that can be solved, the angle of activity it has obtained must not be very large.

As for Italy, because its encounter has become a big problem for itself, it has also become a big problem for the future of the world situation. The extremely serious military setbacks mentioned in the above-mentioned telegram from the International News Agency, problem one; the budding economic crisis, problem two; the domestic attitude of tending towards peace, problem three: in addition, as Hungary and Yugoslavia are close to Italy, there have been frequent reports in recent days that Germany has secretly sent more than 50,000 troops to enter Italy one after another, problem four. The first problem is obvious. The second problem is that Italy was originally not self-sufficient and was absolutely dependent on the Mediterranean Sea, which was slightly blockaded and was able to receive supplies smoothly. The third problem is that the Italian national character loves peace, but now it is engaged in expanding bloodshed, and it was launched under fascist rule rather than democratic rule. The troops have been unfavorable and have not won a single victory. The fact that these three points have become problems is truly undeniable; what is unknowable is to what extent the impact has already become serious? If each battle situation can be turned into an advantage, then there is still hope to reverse the situation, but at present, even if it is not very serious, it will inevitably become more and more serious and eventually become extremely serious; and we cannot regard the "a truce between Britain and Italy is very possible" mentioned in the previous telegram as a sign of the traditional optimism of Britain and the United States. As for the fourth point, the problem of German troops entering Italy, we are still waiting for a follow-up report, but the seriousness of the problem is not in whether it is accurate or not; in other words, if it is accurate, it is a serious problem, and if it is not accurate, it is also a serious problem. If it is accurate, then considering the natural nature of Mr. Hitler, analyzing the basic spirit of Nazi imperialism, and based on the general principle of claiming to be the hegemon, and there can be only one sun in the sky, the consequences of German troops arriving in Italy, no matter how clearly they are touted or how secretly they are promised, will inevitably be a big problem. If it is not accurate, then although the Greek army is only as lively as a dragon and tiger in Albania, and the British army is only as turbulent as the wind and angry tide in Libya, they have not yet stepped into the Italian homeland; however, the news of several defeats, and the bad news of tens of thousands of deaths, disappearances, and captures, and the continuous return of wounded soldiers, these must have already entered the Italian border, and instilled into the ears and eyes of the Italians, and touched the hearts of the government and the public; how can it be done without strong aid? Even if the people are ignorant, Mussolini cannot fail to know; how can it be done without strong aid? Under such circumstances, if it is said that the allied Germany is indifferent and does not send a single soldier, wouldn't it be another big problem? The problems encountered by Italy are like this, so it cannot be managed by doing nothing and healed without medicine! How to cure it, or how it has promoted the greater and worse changes in the situation, must affect the entire changes in the world situation.

A sharp turn for the better is hopeless, and there are countless twists and turns. Please wait and see the inevitable trend.

### Southern Anhui Huajiang Defense Troops Pose a Major Threat to the Japanese Army; Over 30 Japanese Ships and Boats Bombed and Destroyed in Recent Months; Japanese Troops in the Dongliu Xiangkou Area Have Suffered a Complete Retreat

Somewhere in Southern Anhui – The Huajiang Defense Garrison has achieved remarkable results in blocking Japanese shipping. With continuous artillery bombardment by mobile artillery, more than 30 Japanese ships and boats have been damaged by Chinese water mines in recent months. Japanese shipping has been seriously threatened and seems to be carrying out a planned attack-and-retreat war against China, attempting to prevent the Chinese army from advancing and sending troops along the coast to maintain the safety of its shipping. In mid-November, they gathered three to four thousand people in the Dongliu Xiangkou area. From the 21st, under the cover of Japanese aircraft, they launched disturbances from Dongliu and other places in separate directions. The Chinese army blocked them at every turn, and the battle was fierce. Subsequently, another unit of the Chinese army reinforced them and launched a fierce pincer attack on the Japanese army. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties and the remnants were unable to support themselves and suffered a complete retreat on the evening of the 24th. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory and advanced, capturing even more. By the time the remaining Japanese troops had completely retreated to Dongliu and Xiangkou, the original positions were restored. Japanese supplies were scattered all over the ground. In this battle, more than 1,500 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and many spoils of war and important documents were seized. After the disastrous defeat, the Japanese army once again gathered the remnants, attempting to try again. On the evening of the 27th, more than 1,000 Japanese troops were added to Madang from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. On the afternoon of the 28th, more than 1,000 Japanese troops were transferred from Dongtang to Xiangkou, intending to make trouble. The Chinese army was waiting in strict formation. As expected, more than 1,000 Japanese troops launched an attack on the morning of the 1st towards the area north of Juhejiatan (south of Xiangkou), and Madangkou (Pengze), and engaged in fierce fighting for several hours. The Japanese army repeatedly charged back and forth near Malukou, but all failed. On the morning of the 2nd, the number of Japanese troops at the intersection was increased to more than 1,600. Under the cover of Japanese aircraft, they launched a fierce attack on (south of Pengze). The Chinese army fought bravely to meet them, and the fierce fighting lasted for a wide day. The Japanese suffered quite a few casualties. On the morning of the 3rd, the Chinese army, together with fresh troops, launched attacks in separate directions. The Japanese army collapsed to the north. On the afternoon of that day, more than 200 Japanese troops were completely annihilated by the Chinese army, and three Japanese officers were killed. In addition, the Japanese army in the Feituling area was chased and killed by the Chinese army again until they retreated to the high ground south of Malukou and built fortifications to defend themselves.

Japanese Offensive Suffers Setback

A reporter in Chongqing recently met a military expert and inquired about the outline of the recent battles in various theaters and the movements of the Japanese army. He said that since the Japanese army suffered a disastrous defeat in that mid-winter offensive, it had retreated to its original positions and could not move. The invasion of China has repeatedly suffered setbacks, and the southward advance is also impossible. The officers and soldiers are tired of war and their morale is depressed. The outline of the battles in various places is very simple. In Central China, the Chinese armies took advantage of the victory and attacked the Japanese army, all of which were victorious. In South China, the Japanese army remained dormant as before, at a loss. In North China, such as the Pu-Xin Line and the Bai-Jin Highway, they were like a seesaw with each other, but they were all small-scale battles for control. Looking back, the morale of the Chinese army is high and they are eager to try. After four years of resistance, their determination has not diminished. From top to bottom, they are of one mind and believe in the revolutionary tactics instructed by our Supreme Commander, and they have a belief that they will win, which is truly beyond the expectations of the Japanese.

Chongqing – The National Government issued an order on the 19th that Professor Lin Sun of the former National Peking University was of outstanding character and quick in learning, and that he participated in the revolution in his early years and ran around promoting it, not hesitating to endure hardships. Afterwards, he devoted himself to education and immersed himself in writing, expounding on the principles of governance and scholarship in many ways, and had long been admired by future generations. Now that I hear of his sudden death, I am deeply saddened. He should be commended by a clear order to show the government's concern for the old Confucian scholars. This order, (19th dispatch)

### The Su Newspaper Reports on the Chinese Army's Counteroffensive Achieving Major Results; The War in Central China is Extremely Fierce; Yichang and Vicinity Gain the Initiative

Moscow – The Labor Newspaper published a special article today, along with a detailed map, commenting on the situation in the Chinese war zone up to the 17th. It pointed out that the most active warfare in recent months has been in Central China, where the Chinese army, with the help of guerrillas destroying the Japanese army's rear, has launched a major counteroffensive. The fighting is extremely fierce, and the Yangtze River line occupies an important position in the war results. Therefore, both sides are engaged in fierce competition there. The author highly praised the bravery of the Chinese army in combat. The artillery on the Yangtze River and the troops ambushing in the countryside have all achieved important results, posing a major threat to Japanese military operations and transport ships. The Japanese army's offensive attempts in that area have been defeated. In other battlefields, the Chinese army's response to the Japanese offensive is to strengthen the counteroffensive forces. The Chinese army in the Yichang area has also gained the initiative on all fronts. After the Japanese army's recent offensive in North China failed, the Chinese high command has been trying to intercept the Japanese transportation lines, which has now achieved significant results. The author also devoted considerable space to narrating the victories of the Chinese army in Guangdong Province and Hainan Island. Finally, the newspaper said that the Sino-Japanese War has lasted for 41 months, but in the past two years, the Chinese army's front line has entered a state of consolidation. (18th dispatch)

Winter crops are fully planted along the Chongqing-Guiyang road and are thriving. A good harvest of the "Little Spring" crop is expected. All construction in Sichuan Province in recent years has made significant progress, which can be used as a reference for this province. Recently, the international situation has become increasingly favorable to China. Britain and the United States have established loans for military supplies, and the supply is becoming more abundant. The monetary system's foundation is becoming more solid. On this day when final victory arrives, we should constantly encourage each other to complete the great cause of resistance and reconstruction. (19th dispatch)

### The Border War Between Thailand and Vietnam is Tense Again; French Artillery Bombards Thai Territory; Thai Aircraft Bomb Seven Cities in Northern Vietnam

Hanoi – The French attitude towards the war on the Vietnamese-Thai border is gradually becoming tougher today. French artillery fired 24 rounds from Savannakhet in French territory on the Mekong River towards the Thai village of Mok this morning. News last night stated that Vietnamese rebel natives murdered the warden of the Paul-Bert lighthouse on Sunday and kidnapped his wife and young son. It is reported that his wife and young son were taken to the mainland by small boat as hostages. As for what the kidnappers are demanding, whether it is an exchange of hostages or something else, is unknown. (19th dispatch, United Press)

Bangkok – Yesterday, Thai aircraft bombed seven areas in northern Vietnam. The air war between Thailand and Vietnam has therefore become more tense. Radio Bangkok said that three important towns in Cambodia were also bombed by Thai aircraft, losing their original condition. The radio station also repeatedly stated Thailand's declaration of the start of "retaliatory bombing." It is said that the Thai government is extremely willing to negotiate peacefully with France, but France is repeatedly carrying out "provocative bombing," which has led to a worsening of relations between the two countries. The Thai government commented on the statement by the Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux that all Thai aggressive actions will be severely retaliated against, saying that French bombing and threats cannot deter the Thai people. Yesterday's largest air raid by Thailand since the worsening of Thai-Vietnamese relations was Thailand's response to the French air raid. A senior official said, "A Thai will use the French's argument, just as the French want. For every bullet the French fire, the Thai will fire ten bullets in return."

Saigon – An official communiqué recently stated that Thai artillery bombarded Dong Hoi and Savannakhet with small-caliber artillery yesterday, but there were no losses or casualties. (18th dispatch, Havas)

French Newspaper Commentary – Self-Defense Policy

Lyon – The repeated disputes between Thailand and French Vietnam have recently been commented on by Le Temps, which stated that any attempt that harms the territorial integrity of French territories and its legitimate sovereignty will definitely be defended with all our strength. The forceful retaliatory measures taken by the French Air Force against certain acts of violence by Thailand are clear evidence of this. This move has also had a significant impact in Thailand's public opinion circles. If the Thai government is swayed by the extremist forces that advocate "Pan-Thaiism," it will definitely make a big mistake. In short, the policy implemented by the Pétain government is aimed at maintaining the territorial integrity of Vietnam and preserving the unity of all French territories. The resolute attitude adopted by the Vietnamese authorities is in line with this policy. (18th dispatch, Havas)

### Italians Abandon East African Fortress; British Occupy El Wak; Bardia in North Africa is in Imminent Danger; Milan and Naples Bombed

Cairo – It was learned here yesterday that on Tuesday, the Central Army attacked El Wak, a fortress on the border of Italian Somaliland, and the Italian commander guarding the area fled far away on a mule cart as soon as he heard the news of the British attack. Although the Italian army resisted slightly, their combat effectiveness was poor. It is said that the African troops were more willing to engage in combat than the Italian troops. Seeing this situation, one of the Italian troops was greatly discouraged and automatically informed the British army of the location of the stored ammunition after the fortress fell. In this battle, one Italian lieutenant colonel was captured, and a large number of African native soldiers were also captured. The British army also seized several cannons, countless ammunition, and a large number of gasoline and military supplies. Important documents from the Italian headquarters also fell into the hands of the British army. The British army initially advanced rapidly through the Egyptian desert, directly attacking El Wak. Armored vehicles led the way, followed by infantry. They first shelled and destroyed several buildings there before capturing it. (19th dispatch, Reuters)

Cairo – News was received here that this morning, the British mechanized forces in Africa broke through the strong defenses around Bardia, a key port in Libya. The remaining Italian troops are retreating westward from the area to Tobruk and Derna. It is reported that British warships and aircraft are constantly bombing the center of Bardia, and the greatly strengthened British armored columns have surrounded the city and broken through its defenses at several points. Therefore, the fall of the city is imminent. The Italian army is trapped by sea and air attacks and is reportedly retreating on a large scale from the Bardia area. It is also reported that they have broken through the semi-circular line composed of small fortresses, machine gun nests, tank formations, etc. with rapid action, and are fighting within the inner perimeter of Bardia. Therefore, thousands of Italian troops are likely to be unable to escape the encirclement westward. (19th dispatch, International News Service)

British Air Force Attacks in the Rain; Fierce Battles on the Entire Bardia Front

Cairo – Royal Air Force intelligence stated that Royal Air Force aircraft attacked Bardia in the western desert day and night yesterday despite heavy rain. The bombs dropped by the British aircraft in the Libyan border town ignited three fires in Italian army barracks and damaged a large number of transport vehicles. According to the report, reconnaissance flights indicated that the enemy was retreating towards Derna (a coastal town in Libya). Our fighter planes strafed the retreating enemy forces between Bardia and Tobruk with machine guns. British infantry and mechanized forces recently broke through several strongholds in the defensive area around Bardia. The entire front line is still in fierce battle. The British army is currently encountering strong resistance. There are conflicting reports from Bardia. It is reported that the Italian troops there have been heavily besieged but are still resisting stubbornly. According to a British military spokesperson, "It is quite difficult to capture." (19th dispatch, United Press)

Cairo – During the offensive launched by the British army in the western desert last week, the British Air Force shot down or damaged 100 Italian aircraft, while the British aircraft losses were less than 10. This shows the severity of the British Air Force's attack on the Italian army in the western desert. British Air Force squadrons often brave torrential rain and poor visibility to continuously attack airfields in Libya and attack Italian troops and concentration points. A squadron of British eight-gun fighter planes attacked the area the previous day, strafing and destroying these Italian aircraft. The British eight-gun fighter planes were particularly active, attacking down the coast and flying low over the desert at up to 50 feet, severely attacking the advancing Italian army. Italian pilots have no fighting spirit when encountering this strong enemy. According to captured Italian pilots, British aircraft are equipped with eight guns, while Italian aircraft only have two guns and cannot resist. (19th dispatch, Reuters)

Rome – An Italian military communiqué stated that fighting continued in the Bardia area, with a large number of British motorized forces concentrated there. Milan, Genoa, and Naples were bombed by British aircraft. (19th dispatch, Reuters)

London – Although there is heavy snow on the Albanian front, news of Greek victories continues to arrive.

According to unofficial sources, along the Adriatic coast, the Greek army has made progress towards Himara. Some Italian troops are still guarding Porto Palermo between Santi Quaranta and Himara. It is reported that the area is within range of Greek artillery fire. It is reported that the Greek army is approaching Tepelene, southeast of Vlora, and has occupied the high ground controlling Kleisoura. The Greek Prime Minister delivered a speech stating that the Greek army will continue to fight until the Italian army is driven out of Albania. Only when Italy is completely defeated can the war end.

### Successful British Air Raids; Germany Greatly Alarmed; Large Numbers of Children Evacuated to the Southeast; Vienna and Other Places Are Overcrowded

London – According to information received from responsible sources here, Hitler and the Nazis have repeatedly boasted that enemy aircraft cannot enter German airspace, but now seeing the success of British air raids, they are greatly alarmed. The German authorities are now trying to prevent the extent of the damage from being seen by the public. After each air raid, before the all-clear signal is given, they rush to remove rubble or cover up the destroyed traces to prevent people from seeing it. 850,000 children from Berlin, Hamburg, and the Ruhr have been evacuated to the southeast, and many private individuals have also sent away their children, so Vienna and other places are experiencing very crowded conditions for residents. It is reported that the Swedish air defense regulations are very strict. Residents must take shelter in air raid shelters upon hearing the alarm. Those injured indoors will not be compensated. The air raid shelters do not have heating, so Germans are reluctant to leave their bedrooms at night. According to what is heard here, the discomfort of life and the excessive strictness of the regulations have a greater impact on the German spirit than air raids. (19th dispatch, Reuters)

London – On Wednesday evening, the British Air Force attacked Mannheim, the most important industrial and commercial center in southwestern Germany, for the third night in a row. Activity was limited due to bad weather. On the other hand, there was no German aircraft activity in any part of Britain. It was heard this morning that a minor air raid had occurred in Liverpool.

It is reported that there are more than 2,000 residents around the factory. (19th dispatch, Huitong Dispatch)

The Italian attempt to stop the Greek offensive has completely failed. Two divisions of Mussolini's elite troops have been disintegrated. As for the Italian troops in other areas, they are retreating hastily or struggling to avoid being surrounded. (19th dispatch, International News Service)

Athens – The Greek High Command said today that the mountain controlling Kleisoura was occupied by Greece this morning. Kleisoura is the meeting point of roads in the southern part of central Albania. It is also reported that although the wind and snow are very strong and the Italian army is counterattacking, the Greek army is still advancing in other areas. Today, the Greek official newspaper said, "In some areas on the front line, our army won local victories and captured countless Italian troops, including officers, and seized a lot of military supplies. After fierce fighting all day yesterday, the Greek army finally occupied an important mountain head, removing the last major obstacle to advancing into Kleisoura. The Italian army in Kleisoura is retreating and setting fire to various military supply depots. After the indefatigable Greek army controlled the Kleisoura mountain pass and placed it within range of their artillery, Greek shock troops cleared the remaining Italian defenders on the mountains. It is said that Tepelene will fall soon. (19th dispatch, International News Service)

### US Government Orders: Envoys to Italy and France to Return to Their Posts; Vichy Hesitates, US May Seize Opportunity; Italian Military Losses May Bring About a Change in the Situation

Washington, Yesterday, official sources here announced that the United States will urgently order its ambassadors to Italy and France to return to their posts immediately after their leaves expire. It is revealed that Ambassador Phillips will return to Rome, and former Governor of Puerto Rico, Admiral Leahy, will assume the position of the new ambassador to France. It is widely believed that the US government may be preparing to consult with the heads of state of Italy and France, provide them with assistance, and possibly exert pressure to prevent them from being excessively dominated by Germany. Observers here point out that Italy and France are now in urgent need of food and other supplies. The US government may be able to use this food supply to aid Italy and France, and is about to transport supplies across the Atlantic. This announcement by the US government has caused a stir in diplomatic circles, which believe that since people in Rome feel disappointed due to military setbacks and the burgeoning economic crisis, they would gladly accept a cessation of hostilities. A dispatch from Turkey claims that since Italy has shown a gradually inclining attitude towards peace, an armistice between Britain and Italy is "very possible." Diplomats are studying this news and the US government's declaration simultaneously. Since France's surrender, the US ambassador to France has been vacant. The US government is now sending Admiral Leahy to assume this position. At one point, it was widely believed that General Pershing was the most likely candidate for this position, but the former commander of the US Expeditionary Force in the last European war said that if he were offered this position, he would refuse it. It is believed that with Admiral Leahy's prestige and experience, his appointment to this position will further improve relations between the US and the Vichy government. It is generally believed here that Laval is a tool in the hands of the Nazis. The recent reorganization of the French government seems to be Marshal Pétain using his power to suppress Laval. Therefore, greater confidence has been generated between the French and US governments. (International News Agency dispatch, 19th)

Washington, US Secretary of State Hull announced here yesterday that US Ambassador to Italy Phillips will return to his post before Christmas. Phillips has recovered from his recent illness and is expected to go to Italy to take up his duties soon. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 19th)

Rome, News that the US ambassador to Italy is about to return to his post has not yet been received here last night. Officials believe that although this news is unexpected, it is not surprising. Ambassador Phillips left Rome due to illness after Italy entered the war. Therefore, Phillips' departure was purely personal in nature. Now that he has recovered and returned to his post, it is only natural. A month before Phillips left to return to his country, he conducted economic negotiations with Italy regarding its self-sufficiency policy and British blockade measures. It is only natural that negotiations made no progress after Phillips left his post. During Phillips' absence and after the US general election, Italy maintained a very reserved attitude. In short, there are no major diplomatic issues between the US and Italy that urgently need to be resolved. On the contrary, Phillips' return to his post will facilitate the normal diplomatic relations between the two countries. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 19th)

Washington, Hull announced yesterday that the newly appointed US Ambassador to France, Admiral Leahy, will go to Vichy after Christmas. The current chargé d'affaires at the US Embassy in France, Murphy, will inspect the affairs of the US consulates in various French colonies. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 19th)

### Cold Weather Reports from Various Locations

Southern Capital City, Siberian cold waves are moving rapidly from east to west. They have already moved south from western Soviet Union and invaded most parts of Yugoslavia in the Balkan Peninsula. The temperature has dropped to 26 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. Snow accumulation has reached over six feet. Most railways have temporarily suspended traffic because the tracks are deeply buried in snow. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 18th)

Moscow, The cold wave that struck eastern Siberia has not subsided. The average temperature in the Irkutsk region has been 15 degrees Celsius below freezing in recent weeks, which is the standard mild climate in Siberia. However, the temperature suddenly dropped to 39 degrees Celsius below freezing yesterday. The climate in northern East Siberia is even colder, with an average temperature between 48 and 50 degrees Celsius below freezing. It is reported that the temperature in Chita is now 42 degrees Celsius below freezing. (Haitong dispatch, 19th)

### Following the German Envoy, Laval Goes to Paris; The Center of Vichy is Still in Berlin; Flandin is Insignificant

Vichy, German Special Envoy Abetz came here on the 16th of this month to hold talks with the French authorities. After 24 hours of active engagement, the discussions have concluded. Marshal Pétain hosted a banquet last night to entertain him. After the banquet, Abetz immediately returned to Paris, accompanied by General Roux, Marshal Pétain's aide-de-camp, to the border between the Free Zone and the Occupied Zone of France. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

Diplomatic Maneuvering Moves to Paris

After meeting with French Chief Pétain, German Ambassador Abetz returned to Paris yesterday to report the details to the German Foreign Ministry. Subsequently, the focus of German-French affairs has shifted to Paris and Berlin. Laval, the former French Deputy Prime Minister who had been ousted, also went to Paris at 9:15 last night, following closely behind Abetz. Laval stated that this trip was only to take care of personal matters and would not involve any political activities. Regarding the cabinet reshuffle, outside observers feel that Marshal Pétain not only holds a nominal position, but also has great power to arbitrarily replace any minister, and that each minister must be directly responsible to him. There are widespread rumors abroad that the German ambassador came with a list of secret demands, or even presented the "Aix-la-Chapelle" method of governance. French officials dismissed these rumors as false, saying that the German ambassador's visit was only to ascertain whether the changes from Laval to Flandin would affect the cooperation agreements between Germany and France. As a result, the German ambassador left satisfied. Flandin is currently bedridden, and the "diplomatic illness" reported by foreign newspapers is clearly inaccurate. Before his departure, Laval stated that his political career had not come to an end, and that his downfall would not affect the agreements between Germany and France. He also stated that France's future still depends on close cooperation with the Axis powers to build a new European order. (United Press dispatch, 19th)

Laval Defends Himself, Denies Disloyalty

A Reuters diplomatic correspondent in London reports that the turmoil in Vichy does not seem to be subsiding. Laval, the former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, has regained his freedom under the protection of Dr. Ménétrel, but has not yet been reinstated. However, there are rumors that he may be stationed in Paris as the Vichy government's representative. The talks between Marshal Pétain and German Special Envoy Abetz two days ago lasted three hours. It is said that Abetz used persuasive methods rather than coercion during the talks, and tried his best to defend Laval, saying that he had never colluded with the Germans to plot against Pétain's safety or national interests. When Laval went to see Pétain from his place of confinement, he swore an oath, declaring that he had no disloyal intentions. Although Pétain seemed to agree not to punish him, he has not yet reappointed him to an important position. Under these circumstances, Flandin, who succeeded Laval as Foreign Minister, is clearly insignificant. If Abetz insists on Laval joining the cabinet, the cabinet situation will definitely be very tense, because both Laval and Flandin are ambitious and compete for power. If they are both in the cabinet, they will inevitably hurt each other. Therefore, Germany may not be willing to impose this dilemma on Vichy. As for Laval's proposal to allow German troops to pass through France to Italy, no reliable source has confirmed this. If Germany really wants to aid Italy, it can march through the Brenner Pass, and it does not need to pass through French territory. If Germany really wants to pass through French territory, German troops can enter French territory at any time, without waiting for French consent. However, the French navy and colonies will then rise up to resist Germany. Hitler knows that the French navy and colonies are far more important for German use than occupying French territory. The reason for Germany's current approach to dealing with Marshal Pétain lies in this. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

German Side Denies Border Blockade

Vichy authorities deny foreign reports that Germany has blockaded the border in the past 24 hours. However, no one has been able to cross the border in recent days, except for those holding special passports. (United Press dispatch, 19th)

Vichy, Before meeting with the German ambassador, Marshal Pétain first met with Admiral Darlan, the naval commander. This move is of great significance. The strength of the French navy is still very strong, and it has significant combat capabilities in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. Admiral Darlan still has great power in the French government, and opposes ceding the fleet to any other country. He also strongly supports Pétain. (United Press dispatch, 19th)

Vichy, The newly appointed Foreign Minister Flandin contracted the flu after arriving here, but has now recovered and is not in any danger. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

Germany Hopes for Close Cooperation Between the Two Countries

Political circles in Berlin foresee today, because a compromise to resolve the difficult situation has reached the point of Laval's dismissal, that cooperation between France and Germany in establishing a new European order will become closer. At the same time, official German sources in Vichy say that the French ambassador to Germany, de Brinon, has formally replaced General Laurent as the special commissioner for the occupied zone. This order was issued yesterday by the Vichy cabinet. De Brinon is a close friend of Laval, and his power has increased as a result. It is widely believed that this transfer by the French government is also part of the compromise. At the same time, according to general opinion, Marshal Pétain now wields even greater power over French domestic affairs than before. The reason he is able to do so is that France and the Axis powers are still in a period of armistice, and have not yet reached a permanent peace. (International News Agency dispatch, 19th)

### Rumor: German Troops Enter Italian Territory, Preparing to Board Ships and Cross the Sea; Destination Possibly Albania; German Side Has Not Issued a Public Statement, Difficult to Confirm

New York, The New York Times received a dispatch from the Italian-Yugoslav border saying that, according to reliable sources in Italy, German troops are now crossing the Brenner Pass and entering Italian territory, and are boarding transport ships at the port of Trieste on the Adriatic Sea. A large number of troops have gathered at the port. It is also heard from the German side that the German side will issue a statement today regarding the German troops in Italy. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

Hungarian Capital, Well-informed sources here said yesterday that in the past two weeks, more than 50,000 German troops have entered Italy, some preparing to cross the sea to Albania and Libya, and the rest staying in Italy to help the Italian police maintain order. Officials here do not confirm this development, but representatives of the Axis powers have not denied this public information. Similar news has also come from the Southern Capital City, but officials there have not commented either. British observers in London express skepticism. (International News Agency dispatch, 19th)

London, There are widespread reports that more than 50,000 German troops are now concentrated in Turin, Naples, and Taranto. The news of the arrival of this large number of German troops in Italy has not been fully confirmed. However, there is no shortage of evidence of German military preparations. A week ago, the Swedish Aftonbladet published a dispatch from Berlin saying that Germany is now organizing a batch of colonial police, who will receive initial training in Berlin and then go to Rome for further training. A neutral traveler who recently came here from Italy said that before leaving Rome, he heard that a large number of German anti-aircraft gunners had arrived there, and that a large number of German troops had entered Italy under the guise of instructors or trainers. The Italian public is mostly unaware of this matter. However, Italian military officers who told him about this matter spoke with considerable indignation, saying that this was the beginning of Germany's attempt to reduce Italy to a vassal state. The traveler also said that the arrogant attitude of German officers further increased the Italians' hatred. In addition, it is heard that two well-known German economists hold important positions in the Italian economic conferences. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

### The Queen of England at the Front Line

Since Britain was subjected to the German Luftwaffe's blitzkrieg attacks, the normal wartime life has undergone drastic changes, just as the regular life of peacetime has been devastated by war. Men are conscripted into the army, houses are destroyed by bombs, and everyone can only stay at home in the evening, or sleep in the basement and air raid shelters. General family life has also changed greatly, and children have been evacuated to the countryside. Everyone, rich or poor, old or young, has been greatly affected by the war.

The King and Queen, like the common people, are accustomed to hearing the whistling sound of bombs flying, the crashing down of window glass, or the falling of plaster from the walls. They also feel the floor shaking. Buckingham Palace has been hit by at least eight bombs, or exploded nearby, not counting those that fell on the lawn of the palace grounds. The swimming pool in the palace has been destroyed, and the chapel has also been damaged. The windows of the King and Queen's private residence have been shattered, and many holes have been blasted in the courtyard. One bomb landed near the King and Queen's office, just a short distance away. The Queen knows the outcome of the bombing, just as her subjects know.

For the sake of the war, the Queen's daily life has naturally changed greatly. On the one hand, this is also gratifying for her, because during the war, all social gatherings and various ceremonies have come to a halt. There are no more court appearances, no more tours, and no more banquets. Under these circumstances, the Queen has always been the mother of the nation, but in reality, she does not enjoy it.

What she is most concerned about is the British people—how they live, how they fight the war. Therefore, although the Queen's responsibilities have increased greatly due to the war, she has more opportunities to be close to the people and more time to engage in the activities she enjoys. Every morning, she always plans everything in her study first. After meals, she makes at least one visit, sometimes as many as four or five, to inspect hospitals, first aid stations, canteens, shelters, or other places where women work.

Since London was bombed, the Queen's daily life has undergone a change. Every morning, the location of the latest bombing is reported to the palace first. Based on this report, the King and Queen choose the most heavily affected area to inspect and comfort. Therefore, the residents of the slum areas who have been bombed and are stunned, when they are looking for relics in the rubble overnight, often see the Queen gracefully arrive, crossing the broken walls and charred wood, smiling at them and expressing her condolences to everyone. On the morning of the day the German Luftwaffe launched its first blitzkrieg against England, the King and Queen drove straight to the East End, which had been heavily bombed by German aircraft. Wherever the royal carriage went, the people cheered again and again. This kind of tour of the disaster areas is of great benefit, because it can show the people that their King and Queen are standing on the front line with them?

Buckingham Palace under air raids is like other major institutions in London. Sound detectors and searchlights are installed on the roof, constantly sweeping and shining in the high sky. In the nearby guard areas, alarm bells are also installed. When an aircraft appears overhead, an alarm is sounded. This is different from ordinary reports. When this kind of emergency alarm is heard, the people in the palace, including the King and Queen, completely run into the bomb shelter, leaving only a team of air raid wardens on the ground guarding.

The equipment in the bomb shelter in the palace is similar to that built under ordinary houses, and it is not particularly safe. These air raid shelters are mostly converted from basements or storage rooms, with wooden frames erected and more sandbags piled up. They do not go deep underground. Such air raid shelters can be seen everywhere in the homes of wealthy families in London.

When the Queen goes out during the day, she does not change her itinerary even if she encounters an alarm on the way, as if she ignores the air raids, unless the aircraft is already soaring above, she will never first hide in the air raid shelter. It can be said that although the danger she may encounter is not more than that of ordinary Londoners, it can be encountered at any time. In the high sky above London, solitary aircraft often appear in the clouds. They all close the sound of their engines. No aircraft locator in the world, no matter how sophisticated, has a way to find their sound. These German aircraft often break through the clouds and descend straight down, dropping bombs or firing machine guns in the bustling city. Sometimes, an air raid alarm is not heard when these aircraft attack. But the Queen, like any Englishman, does not stop the work she is doing, regardless of how the aircraft above her head is threatening. She still carries out everything as if nothing has happened, resembling any lady in the British Isles. (To be continued)

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Buying Frenzy; Strong Demand for US Dollar Futures; Speculators Buy All Day Long

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices did not fluctuate. The black market for British and American exchange rates continued to tighten. People's hearts were generally uneasy. Speculators were buying all day long. Although some sellers emerged, supply and demand ultimately remained uneven. Before noon, the US dollar had shrunk to 5.75 yuan. The market later traded at 5.71875 yuan, and futures were very popular, with strong demand. Today, speculators and Japanese banks bought the most US dollars for January. The closing price was 3 shillings, 6.09375 pence for British gold and 5.71875 yuan for the US dollar, tighter than the previous day, British gold 0.0625, US dollar 0.09375. The US dollar closed at 5.6875 yuan. It is heard that a certain speculator bought 200,000 US dollars to cash out gold. Trading was extremely active, and the market was in a state of chaos.

The Market Gradually Tightens

At the beginning of the morning, London's large transactions, both near and far, were flat. New York's silver price was still flat. London's spot gold was fixed. Exchange rates for British to US, Shanghai, etc. did not change. The US to British did not move, to Shanghai was slightly 2.2 cents, to France there was no market.

After the opening, Chinese banks first had an appetite, and speculators followed with aggressive buying. The market gradually tightened. Initially, British banks ceded to Chinese banks and speculators US dollars for the next month at 5.78125 yuan. HSBC's listed prices did not fluctuate. The silver equalization tax also did not increase or decrease. After this, speculators continued to be active, and the potential trend became more popular. It is estimated that Chinese banks sold US dollars for the next month to speculators at 5.75 yuan. At the same time, Japanese banks also came to the market to buy US dollars for the same month at 5.75 yuan. By noon, demand was still strong, and long-term needs were very high. The closing price was 3 shillings 6.40625 pence for spot British gold and 5.75 yuan for the US dollar.

Few Sellers in the Afternoon

The market was initially flat in the afternoon, and then speculators sold slightly. It is estimated that US dollars for the next month were trading open at 5.75 yuan. Soon, speculators turned around and bought again. The market tightened. US dollars for the same month were quoted at 5.71875 yuan by foreign banks. People's hearts were uneasy, and real customers were scarce. The market was buoyant at the close. As a result, British gold for spot and current month was 3 shillings 6.09375 pence, and the US dollar was 5.71875 yuan. British gold for the next month was 3 shillings 5.9375 pence, and the US dollar was 5.6875 yuan.

### Rumors Spread, Gold Rush Resurges, Off-Exchange Trading Reaches a High of 6110 Yuan

Yesterday, the fish market and black market suddenly rose due to unfavorable rumors. The rising trend expanded and the price broke through the 6,000 yuan mark. It then surged to around 6,100 yuan. Although securities firms and banks (substituting for bill merchants buying 200,000 US dollars) emerged to reverse the trend, selling about 4,000 taels each, the exchange rate tightened. A certain gold shop, a small money shop, and two other banks continued to buy. The scattered buying caused the price, after a small rebound to 5,980 yuan after the morning opening, to resume its upward trend amid rumors in the afternoon, soaring to a high price of 6,100 yuan before the evening close, a huge increase of 130 yuan. After the close, it rose again to 6,110 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 12,300 taels. Due to market chaos, no one inquired about cash. The price was 35 yuan lower than the futures price. There was also no opening for swap transactions. Buyers offered 30 to 35 yuan to sellers. Jewelry gold rose by 10 yuan to 620 yuan. Customs gold, etc., were flat.

The Fish Market Jumps 130 Yuan

At the beginning of the morning, due to the upward sentiment outside the market in the afternoon of the previous day, there were more buyers than sellers at the opening. Banks first made a deal for 20 taels, reaching 6,000 yuan, an increase of 40 yuan compared to the previous afternoon's close. The trading floor was unusually excited, and the buying atmosphere raised the price by another 25 yuan. It is estimated that the banks made a total of 20 taels, at 6,025 yuan. Before long, due to the consistent selling from banks and securities firms, the price suffered a setback. It is estimated that the banks sold 20 taels to gold shops, entering the 6,000 yuan mark, at 5,980 yuan. However, the exchange rate was reported tight, and the price could not be lowered. Short sellers took advantage of the low price to buy, and long sellers took profits. After a period of maneuvering, the price reached a high of 6,060 yuan due to the exhaustive searching by the Yu tax bank. It is estimated that the securities firms entered the banks with 20 taels. After this, the buying trend was slightly killed due to the cession of some bills merchants. However, the upward trend remained firm. As a result, the banks made a deal for 20 taels, at 6,035 yuan as the noon closing price. The banks made a deal for 20 taels at the afternoon opening, at 6,055 yuan. Afterwards, it fell slightly due to selling by retail investors. It is estimated that the gold shops sold 20 taels to the banks, at 6,010 yuan. Finally, due to the tight exchange rate, gold shops and other long investors bought in large quantities, and the huge buying trend lifted the price to 6,100 yuan. It is estimated that the banks made a deal for 20 taels. The banks made a deal for 20 taels at the evening close, at 6,090 yuan, a huge increase of 130 yuan compared to the previous day. After the close, it rose again to 6,110 yuan, and finally to 6,105 yuan. The total fluctuation for the day was 120 yuan (excluding the after-hours market). The selling price of the spot gold of the cash shops was 15 yuan lower than the futures price and 50 yuan lower than the purchase price. The spot gold should be listed 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold, but there were few openings.

### Jewelry Gold Listed at 620 Yuan

The selling price of gold jewelry in jewelry stores rose by 5 yuan in the morning and another 5 yuan at 4 pm. It is estimated that the Dahang industry revised the listed price to 620 yuan. The new industry had similar prices to the previous ones, with a purchase price about 30 yuan lower.

### The Price of US Dollar Notes Soars to $17.50

Yesterday, in the foreign exchange market, the market price of silver dollars suddenly surged past the 6,000 yuan mark, causing British gold pounds and British pounds to rise by 3 yuan each. The British pound already exceeded the 140 yuan mark. The price of British gold notes remained stable. The speculation in US dollar notes was intense, reaching a high of $17.50 in the evening market, a sharp increase of 1.5 jiao from the previous day. This was due to renewed rumors that the new "Central Bank" was about to be established. There was also no lack of demand for Hong Kong notes, and market prices continued to rise. Canadian dollars and Philippine notes were also in demand, and market prices tended to rise. The supply and demand of Japanese gold notes were balanced, and market prices remained stable, remaining at $1.575 in the evening market. The supply of Korean notes was slightly stronger, and the evening market retreated to $1.32.

### Securities: Government Bonds Reach New High Prices - Steel Stocks Rise Due to Capital Increase -

The gray market for government bonds was particularly good yesterday. Both Type A and Type B bonds reached 74 yuan, exceeding the highest price of 73.9 jiao on November 25. Type B also reached 8.05 yuan, equivalent to the previous highest price. After hovering and brewing for two or three weeks, new high prices were finally discovered. Although the bulls bear very heavy interest, they are still able to gain an advantage, which shows their strong financial strength. If this momentum continues, there may be hope for further progress. In yesterday's trading, the appetite of Sin孚 was still insufficient in the morning. Dechang, Hongda, and the companies at numbers 16 and 40 all had considerable demand. Shengda also turned to active trading. Defu exclusively favored 96, actively buying in, which must have been for other calculations. The price was raised to above 7 yuan, supplied by Hongda, Juxin, and Yuda. In the afternoon, Shengda, Lianyi, and Number 5 entered Type A bonds, immediately seeing a new high price of 74 yuan. Hongda entered E and exited C, and many retail investors bought Huai. Houda, Runli, Tongshun, and Shunchang all sold. As a result, Type A and Type B bonds were slightly higher, while the rest were slightly weak. The transaction volume was more than 2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

In stock trading, 100 shares of Sanyou Industrial were traded at a price of $2.35.

The public stock market continued the upward trend of the previous day, and the situation became more and more intense. The fluctuations throughout the day were quite large. This was probably due to the Steel Company announcing that it would issue a 50% dividend and issue new shares (10 yuan per share, one new share for each old share). This stock had the highest transaction volume, and the price was 10 yuan higher than the previous day. Jardine Matheson also once reached a high price of 93 yuan. Tsingtao Beer also had a large transaction volume, with a price of 7.2 jiao. All industrial stocks benefited and rose. The potential of rubber stocks was also strong, and prices increased slightly.

According to the Steel Co., Ltd., managed by Jardine Matheson, it has decided to continue raising 250,000 new shares. The subscription price per share is set at 10 yuan in national currency. The shareholder register on January 3 of next year will be used as the basis for old shareholders to subscribe for shares according to their holdings. Each old share can subscribe for one new share.

### Cotton Yarn: Profit-Taking Emerges, Yarn Market Rises Sharply and Retraces Slightly, Actual Sales Can Be Said to Be Quiet

After the yarn market discovered a new peak, it turned back. This was because most profit-takers cashed out, resulting in a slight loosening of chips and a decline in market conditions. At the same time, actual transactions were greatly reduced, so most of the floating long positions tended to close out. However, as the foreign exchange contraction and gold prices rose, foreign customers still entered more and exited less. However, some people say that the price of 20-count assorted brand yarn is inevitably cheaper, and the difference from the Double Horse brand is too far. Today, 360 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Double Horse opened in the morning. Because the bulls were very active in the afternoon of the previous day and were eagerly searching outside, it had risen to 1,348 yuan. This morning, there was a lot of discussion, saying that the gray market for gold had risen sharply, and everyone unanimously expected it to rise. The opening price was 1,352 yuan. As soon as this price opened, buyers gathered, and the shouting shook the outdoors, rising directly to 1,355 yuan. Unexpectedly, profit-taking bulls took the opportunity to massively sell off, causing the trading floor to loosen slightly. It fluctuated between 1,350 yuan and 1,354 yuan several times. However, the gold gang, due to the weakening of foreign exchange, was dragging fiercely. Finally, due to large households spitting out a large amount, the market fell back a step, falling to 1,337 yuan. By 11 o'clock, the foreign exchange situation was very tight, and it returned to 1,345 yuan at the close. According to statistics, 5,630 bales were traded in half a day. The price of 10-count Double Horse yarn rose by 5 yuan. The amount bought by each gang is recorded on the left:

Fellow traders 5,610 Hong Kong 20

Statistics 5,630

The yarn market continued to be flat in the afternoon. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn started at 1,340 yuan, followed by 1,341 yuan.

The cotton market is quiet.

The current situation of the machinery still has no special characteristics. The factories also lack large-scale development, so they are still in a quiet and stable state. The price of fire machines is 101 yuan, Changyinsha is 216 yuan, Brazilian cotton is 282 yuan, and Bailuo is 233 yuan.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth is Popular

The factory cloth market was firm and rising yesterday. The popularity was enthusiastic, probably because the price of Dong cloth continued to rise sharply. The sales of fine cloth and twill from our factory were hindered by exports, and the sales prices were still low. Therefore, the appetite of recycling companies and dyeing factories gradually increased. Hand goods were in short supply, and the sales prices were gradually raised. The actual price of fine cloth opened at 35.5 yuan in the morning, and later rose to 36 yuan. The remaining lots also rose by 2.5 to 7.5 jiao. Fine twill rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao, coarse cloth and grey cloth rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao, and bleached and dyed cloth rose by about 5 jiao. The street traded more than 1,600 pieces of various cloths. The Zhejiang, Ningbo, and Taizhou gangs handled more than 300 pieces of Li cloth, coarse and fine cloth, and colored cloth. The Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs handled more than 500 pieces of coarse and fine cloth, colored cloth, bleached cloth, poplin, etc. The Jiangnan gang handled nearly 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. 610 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on the 20th.

The price of Dong cloth rose sharply. The price of medium-grade fine cloth jumped wildly by more than 1 yuan per bolt. The price of the leading fine cloth rose by 8.75 jiao. The highest price was 38.7 yuan at the opening and 38.6 yuan at the close. The price of fine twill rose by 5 jiao per bolt. Serge rose by only 1.15 yuan, which is only 1 fen per yard. This is because the market lacks buyers due to the season.

### The Trend of Italian Woolen Fabric - It Will Soon Disappear from the Market -

Italian woolen fabric has recently shown a sharp downward trend. The inventory in Shanghai is decreasing day by day, and sales are also weak. Its most famous numbers, 41,000, 7,000, 40,000, 14,000, and 18,000, as well as the floral fabric Harvey, will disappear from the market next year. Since the outbreak of the European War, foreign firms have changed their pricing to US dollars, and most require a deposit of 30-40%. War risk insurance and other expenses are very high, and the calculated cost is almost equal to that of British goods. Moreover, its arrival in port is uncertain, and new Italian ships cannot sail to Shanghai at all, so freight transportation is cut off. Moreover, most of it is spun from Shanghai weaving factories. According to general psychology, the selling price of Italian woolen fabric must be slightly cheaper than that of British-made woolen fabric, and the price of Japanese woolen fabric must be cheaper than that of Italian woolen fabric. The price of our factory's woolen fabric must be even cheaper than that of Japanese woolen fabric, otherwise, sales will inevitably be greatly affected. This is an unbreakable thing. Yesterday, the selling price of number 7,000 was 37-38 yuan in legal tender per yard, and the price of number 42,000 was 26-27 yuan, which was no higher or lower than the price one month ago, which shows how bleak it is.

### Grains: Foreign Rice Has Become the Only Source of Sustenance for Citizens - Speculators Therefore Regard It as a Great Profit Opportunity and Buy It Whenever It Is Cheap - Japonica Rice Has Also Become a Luxury Food with Poor Sales

Since the implementation of price limits on foreign rice, it has been in a state of contempt for two consecutive dynasties. This is because the goods on the way have arrived one after another, and the orders have not been terminated due to the foreign exchange contraction. Yesterday, new transactions continued, and Changyi sold 1,000 tons of small grain for February delivery at a price of 81 yuan. There were also many other negotiations seeking a settlement. Moreover, the price of domestic rice has fallen sharply by 1-2 yuan yesterday. The market opened slightly calmer yesterday morning, and there seemed to be a downward trend. Number 2 Red Pagoda had once opened at the limit, and other assorted brand number 2 had fallen below the limit price by 1 yuan, opening at 80.05 yuan. The market price of Huojiao opened at 84 yuan and 83.5 yuan. Unexpectedly, after this depreciation, speculators suddenly rose up and took it directly, and the situation returned to the previous state, and the shouting price rose, causing a glimmer of dawn to be overshadowed by Yin Ling, and reached the old state of waiting for the limit. This is because foreign rice has become the only source of sustenance for the people, and speculators therefore regard it as a great profit opportunity, and they do not relax at all. They buy it whenever it is cheap and drag it away whenever they have goods. As a result, rice prices are easy to rise and difficult to fall. The heart of a tiger and wolf is more sinful than eating people with beasts. Therefore, the market fluctuates up and down and is still in a state of neither honor nor disgrace. Number 1 Saigon is 87 yuan, Number 2 is 81.5 yuan, and the final price is 80.05 yuan. Huojiao is 85 yuan to 83.5 yuan, Number 2 Siam is 80 yuan, 79.5 yuan, Xiaowen is 79 yuan, 78.5 yuan, Micha is 77.5 yuan, 77 yuan, Suited is from 75 yuan, and the final price is 70 yuan. Wuhu Jian is 78 yuan, 77.7 jiao, Number 2 Saigon for December delivery, the opening price of Jianyuan goods is 84 yuan, followed by 83.5 yuan, and Hezhong for January delivery is 86 yuan. Xiaojiao Rishin December 9 is 91 yuan, and January delivery is 81.5 yuan to 81 yuan. A total of 9,600 tons of original packages were opened throughout the day, and there were less than 3,000 packages of spot goods.

Although the arrival of domestic rice such as thick and thin Japonica rice is limited, the price of rice has risen sharply again and again, and the price is too high for ordinary civilians to afford. Domestic rice has become a luxury food, so there are mostly foreign rice buyers in shops, and there are few domestic rice buyers. In the associated relationship, the market sales are also unusually sluggish, so general cargo owners want to push up the price without success. Seeing that the market environment is bad, they all seek to let go, but it is difficult to invite demand. Therefore, it falls sharply by 2-3 yuan. The opening price of Kunshan Hu is 96-97 yuan for white Japonica rice, 101 yuan for Zhen Special, and 100 yuan for Qingjiao. The opening price of thin rice Hu is 88 yuan, 87 yuan.

The sales of glutinous rice are ultimately auxiliary products and are difficult to continue. Therefore, general speculators feel that the profit is small and the risk is high, and they all want to get rid of it. However, the thoughts are the same, and if you loosen, I will also loosen, suddenly creating a competitive selling trend. How can sales be sluggish and difficult to find a seller? As a result, although the market price has been cut by 1-2 yuan, the transaction volume is still scarce. If Yili opens at 94 yuan, and Hong Kong Baiyuan's high-quality goods have opened at 83-84 yuan, ordinary goods are only 83 yuan to 80 yuan.

### Foreign Flour: Over-the-Counter Transactions Are Quite Lively

The factory price of flour is still 18 yuan. The issue of increasing the price of cheap flour has not yet been approved by the authorities, so there is no change for the time being. After the Flour Market was banned from speculative trading by the Miscellaneous Grain Association, the market trading has disappeared. However, over-the-counter transactions are still quite lively. The price of Wild Boar brand Australian flour is 21.6 yuan, and the price of Flower Bird Clock Tower brand is 21.2-3 yuan, which is 3-4 jiao higher than before. The total market transaction volume by local customers is more than 5,000 bags. Although the price of cheap flour has not increased, the output of each factory has been sharply reduced, and there is news of a strike at the Fuxin factory, so the quantity allocated by the two factories is not enough for the needs of the street.

Wheat transactions are still lacking in development. The inventory of each product is depleted, and both Japanese and Chinese factories cannot operate smoothly. However, the cargo owners are hoarding and trying to push up the price. Yesterday, the price of rice flour has softened, so the purchase price of Chinese factories is also limited to 31 yuan. Japanese factories are still brewing and have not officially opened for business.

### Oil Cake: The Oil Market Is Held Tightly

Yesterday's oil market was still forcibly held by domestic households. The trend throughout the day, whether it was soybeans, sesame, or miscellaneous grains, was monopolized by speculators, and the market price continued to rise by more than 1 yuan. However, the market atmosphere at the close was slightly unstable. According to statistics, 150 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were sold at a price of 87.5 yuan, 50 barrels of new goods at 89 yuan, 200 pieces of road goods at 89 yuan to 90 yuan, 200 barrels of Qingdao raw oil at 119 yuan to 120 yuan, more than 600 cans of Yantai canned new raw oil at a price of 117 yuan, 50 pieces of Yantai soybean oil at 83 yuan, 100 barrels of Dalian soybean oil at 112 yuan to 112.5 yuan, and 400 barrels for delivery in January were ordered at 113 yuan to 114 yuan, falling to 113 yuan. 600 pieces of Dayou Factory soybean oil were sold at 91.5 yuan to 92 yuan, and then to 91 yuan. 100 barrels of Youpu Dong Japanese factory oil were sold at a price of 88 yuan.

Miscellaneous grains were shipped out. On the 19th, 1,210 cans of raw oil came from Qingdao. On the 20th, 550 bags of soybeans, 9,080 pieces of soybean cake, and 300 bags of sesame were all shipped to Hong Kong.

### North and South Goods: Dried Longan Drops

Due to "market" factors, miscellaneous dried longan have recently turned over, causing the accumulation of goods arriving before and after, and the market has softened. The opening price of high-quality goods is less than half, and it has fallen by 350 yuan. Therefore, the market price has fallen, and the later opening prices of Xinghua goods have not been traded, and the profits are even smaller, not even enough to cover the cost.

### Sugar Market: Dutch Red Sugar Rebounds

Yesterday, the sugar market rebounded due to tighter foreign exchange rates. Dutch red sugar was the strongest. The association's price for spot goods was 75.5 yuan for 34 coarse white foreign banks, up 4 jiao. Dutch red sugar spot goods arrived at 60 yuan, and later rose by 2 jiao to 60.2 jiao. Road goods were 60.3 jiao to 5 jiao, up 7 jiao to 1 yuan. Taikoo cart white B mark was 75 yuan, HY mark was 71.6 jiao, and road goods were 71 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: Want to Monopolize the World Silk Market - Attempt to Cut off the Foundation of Chinese Silk

The United States has a great need for Tussah silk, but Shanghai has no silk to supply. There is a lot of stock of American white factory silk, and the sales of Japanese silk are very problematic. Therefore, according to the English Financial Business Newspaper, Japan is cutting down mulberry trees in the occupied areas of China, intending to prevent China from producing silk again and specialize in growing cotton to meet its own needs. The newspaper said that if this plan is realized, the silk industry in the silk-producing areas of Central China will be cut off. If it is to be revived, it must be after 50-60 years. In this way, the recent news that the "Central China" company has suspended the export of raw silk can also find a reason. However, 80% of the mulberry fields are in the guerrilla area, so the Japanese side's conspiracy to fundamentally destroy Chinese silk is unlikely to be realized.

### Coal: Inferior Coal Dust Prices Rise Naturally

Recently, due to the flooding of the Whangpoo River, the demand for washed coal dust has surged, and high-grade coal has become equally available as demand. Prices have remained stable. However, inferior coal dust can be used for blending, leading to a rush to purchase, and prices have risen without being artificially inflated. Wholesale prices among industry peers are: Zhufeng coal dust at 120 yuan per ton, Xishan coal dust at 100 yuan per ton, ex-warehouse, excluding handling fees. This is over ten yuan higher than the previous month.

### Japanese Blockade Wangjia Lane, Demolish Houses on Taopeng Road; Another Thousand People Left Homeless; No Progress in Shanghai West Police Authority Agreement

Since the Japanese army demolished houses in Wangjia Village in Wangjia Lane, Daxilu, and ordered over 300 households to relocate, resulting in more than 1,000 people being displaced, they have now completely blockaded the lane with barbed wire fences. Three guards are stationed, and residents are not allowed to enter. Even speaking to residents inside the lane from outside the fence is interfered with. Most of the residents of Zhu'anbang have already moved out, with very few people entering or exiting between 7:00 AM and 5:00 PM yesterday. Furthermore, after the Japanese military doctor Nomura was assassinated on Taopeng Road, the Japanese side has also demolished civilian houses in the vicinity, following the harsh methods implemented in Shanghai West, and is opening up a new road. Details are as follows:

More Civilian Houses Demolished on Taopeng Road

According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, a Japanese military doctor, Nomura, was assassinated on Taopeng Road in the Northern District of the Public Concession on the afternoon of the first day of this week. Today (December 19), over a hundred Chinese laborers, supervised by Japanese naval infantry, demolished over 50 houses in the area, leaving over 300 Chinese residents homeless. It is said that the Japanese side is constructing a new road in the area. It is expected that the Japanese side will continue to forcibly demolish civilian houses in the area, and the number of residents forced to relocate and left homeless will reach as many as 1,000.

Nomura Road Likely to be Opened

It has been found that since the end of September of this year, there have been 13 assassinations of Japanese military personnel in Shanghai. Among them, two military police officers, Sasaki and Saito, were assassinated in the Western District. The Japanese side then constructed two new roads in the area and named them "Sasaki Road" and "Saito Road." Now, a third new road is being opened in the Northern District, and it may also be named "Nomura Road." It is reported that the Chinese arrested by the Japanese on Sunday is the main suspect in the assassination of Nomura. However, the Japanese authorities remained silent on this matter this morning. It is said that the Chinese was arrested by Japanese naval infantry in an alley between Huacheng Road and Jining Road. Several others, who were carrying guns, were also arrested.

Report of Assassin's Capture Unconfirmed

According to the Shanghai Times, the Japanese naval infantry is currently intensifying the search for the assassin who shot and killed Japanese military doctor Lieutenant Nomura at the intersection of Taopeng Road and Huade Road on Monday afternoon. The rumor that the assassin, who escaped into a village near Jining Road, has been captured has not been confirmed as of yesterday (December 19). Japanese official sources claim that the suspect arrested on Tuesday has been identified as the main culprit in the case. However, they claim that based on the statements of the first batch of those arrested, it is hoped that other suspects can be captured for questioning. The police also stated that they were unaware of the developments in the Japanese side's large-scale search. At the same time, it is reported that a Chinese child who was injured by stray bullets during the Japanese pursuit of the assassin has been sent to Yangshupu Hospital, where the bullet was removed from his left buttock, and his condition is gradually improving.

Rickshaw Pullers Unwilling to Obtain Licenses

According to the Shanghai Times, the "Municipal Revenue Bureau" recently announced that all single-wheeled vehicles operating on the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads must register and obtain licenses before the 16th of this month, otherwise they will not be allowed to enter the area. However, it is reported that very few rickshaws have gone to register, and the vast majority of rickshaws, automobiles, and trucks continued to display Municipal Council licenses and operate as usual yesterday (December 18). The "Municipal" regulations require a monthly rickshaw license fee of 12 yuan, but rickshaw pullers claim that they do not want to obtain new licenses because rickshaw business in the Western District is currently very poor and not worth the 12 yuan license fee. In addition, negotiations between rickshaw pullers and Municipal Council representatives regarding the proposal to organize a rickshaw franchise company in the city are expected to be completed within a few days. However, the specific terms under which the Municipal Council will grant rickshaw privileges are not yet known.

Police Authority Agreement Not Finalized

According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, it is rumored today (December 19) that negotiations between the Municipal Council and the "Municipal" government on the issue of the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads are proceeding smoothly. However, according to the "Municipal" side, the "Municipal" authorities have not yet studied the matter. The draft of the Western District agreement between the Municipal Council and the "Municipal" government in February of this year is expected to receive the attention of the "Municipal" authorities soon, but the "Municipal" side has not yet taken concrete steps. It has been found that the police chiefs of both sides have recently drafted detailed police authority agreements for the Extra-Settlement Roads area and submitted them to their respective municipal authorities for final consideration and signature.

Tax Revenue Situation Remains Unchanged

According to a Municipal Council spokesperson, the Council is awaiting a reply from the "Municipal" side on this matter and believes that the issue will be resolved soon. As for the tax revenue situation in the Extra-Settlement Roads area, it remains unchanged. The rumors that the two sides will only establish a police authority agreement and a joint police force after agreeing on the tax revenue issue are inaccurate.

Caojiadu Suddenly Blockaded Again

The situation in Caojiadu, Shanghai West, which had been experiencing abnormal prosperity, suddenly changed dramatically yesterday. The reason for this sudden change was that a large number of Japanese soldiers and "police" suddenly mobilized around Caojiadu at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, carrying large batches of barbed wire, and set up barriers in the middle of the road at various key entrances to Caojiadu, such as (1) the intersection of Robison Road, (2) the intersection of Great Western Road, (3) the intersection of Brenan Road, (4) the entrance to Xinkangli on Connaught Road, (5) the rear intersection of Great Western Road at Wujiaochang, (6) the intersection of Great Western Road at Xinkangli, etc., leaving only entrances and exits for passage. Several Japanese military police and "police" were stationed beside the barbed wire, with the "police" inspecting passing pedestrians. The No. 7, No. 10, and No. 2 buses of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, which originally terminated at Caojiadu, temporarily changed their terminus to the Singapore Road station because the gap in the barbed wire on Great Western Road was too narrow and the buses were too large to pass through.

### Restoration of Customs Clearance at Zhejiang and Fujian Ports Not Yet Realized

In order to exclude third countries from trading with China, the Japanese Navy blockaded ports in Zhejiang and Fujian, such as Xiangshanpu, Zhenhai, Wenzhou, Sandu'ao, and Fuzhou, on July 15 of this year, citing military necessity. On August 14, it announced the expansion of the blockade of the coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang on the 15th, including eight locations such as Haiping, Zhapu, Xinghua Bay, Meizhou Bay, and Quanzhou. As a result, water traffic between Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Fujian was completely disrupted. For many months, although foreign ships occasionally sailed, they were all risky voyages, and were often detained. Yesterday, a certain newspaper reported that customs clearance had been restored at ports in Zhejiang and Fujian. Foreign shipping companies believed that since navigation had been suspended for a long time, the restoration of customs clearance would mean the possibility of resumption of navigation. However, when they inquired with the customs, the customs knew nothing about the aforementioned restoration of customs clearance. As a result, the companies were extremely disappointed. According to those familiar with the matter, the blockade between Shanghai and Zhejiang has been in place for a long time, and the resumption of navigation is unlikely to be realized in the short term. Recently, although Minhe and Changde plan to sail to eastern Zhejiang, there has been no report of them applying for customs clearance or where they are heading. Moreover, there is no news of the release of the German ships Moufu, Haifu, and Feikang, and the American ship Dasheng, which were detained in Zhoushan.

### American Consulate Protests Japanese Interference with American Radio Station; American Station's Generators Very Powerful; Rumor of Retaliation Against Japanese Stations

The radio war between the United States and Japan in the Far East was brewing yesterday (December 19). It is rumored that the XMHA American-owned China American Broadcasting Station in the city has been interfered with by the Japanese side for four days due to its broadcasting programs. Unless the Japanese side immediately stops the interference, the American station will retaliate against the Japanese stations in the city.

Mr. Hailey Expresses Determination to Fight to the End

Mr. Hailey, the manager of China American Broadcasting Station, said that he had heard the above news, but refused to say whether he intended to retaliate. Hailey also said that "we certainly will not give up here, but will fight to the end to defend American rights."

American Consul General Lodges Protest

It is reported that the American Consul General in Shanghai has lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities regarding the Japanese interference with the wavelength of China American Broadcasting Station. According to a staff member of the consulate, the American authorities pointed out in the protest document that the rumors "attribute the responsibility for this matter to the Japanese side," so please provide a detailed report from the Japanese Consul General and stop the interference.

The Origin of the Dispute Lies with the Japanese Side

Hailey also stated that the interference with China American Broadcasting Station is due to the Japanese Radio Management Office. He had received a letter from the head of the management office requesting that he limit the power of China American Broadcasting Station to 200 watts and submit news to the Japanese side for inspection before broadcasting it. It is generally believed that if a radio war between the United States and Japan occurs, the two Japanese stations in the city (call signs XQHA and XOJB) will be unable to broadcast because the American station's generators are powerful enough to disrupt both Japanese stations.

American Generators Can Retaliate

If the radio war intensifies, American generators can disrupt all Japanese stations set up abroad, and China American Broadcasting Station itself can make it impossible for anyone to listen to the large station in Tokyo (call sign JOAK), which broadcasts long and short waves to the United States, the Dutch East Indies, and Malaysia. The long-wave broadcasts of China American Broadcasting Station today are still subject to interference, but the short-wave broadcasts can be heard clearly.

### Hong Kong Rice Allowed to be Shipped to Shanghai in Large Quantities; Rice Shops Selling at Low Prices

A certain rice shop received a telegram from its counterpart in Hong Kong yesterday, stating that "Hong Kong rice prices have gradually declined since the authorities announced standard prices. The authorities are also strictly preventing rice merchants from taking advantage, ordering the police to pay attention to the retail prices of rice merchants, with violators facing a fine of 1,000 yuan or 12 months in prison. They are also allowed to transfer large quantities of rice to Shanghai for adjustment." Therefore, Hong Kong rice is expected to arrive in succession.

Rice Shops Selling at Low Prices

Although retail sales at the city's rice shops are still being carried out at the original prices, taking a commission of 1.5 yuan per picul, the rice is mixed with inferior goods or impurities, so the profits are still quite large. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this and severely punish those who are found to be selling rice containing impurities to curb their misdeeds. According to news from the rice industry yesterday, some rice shops in the city are voluntarily selling low-priced rice, which is slightly cheaper than non-low-priced rice, but the quality of the rice is worse. It is hoped that the Rice Shop Guild will rectify this.

Universally Implemented

At the same time, it is still hoped that the guild will lead its members to universally sell low-priced rice. All members of the guild should set up a low-priced sales point in each store, limit the amount of rice sold each day, and stipulate the quantity limited per person. This should be maintained persistently and only stop when rice prices fall to a certain level, so that it can benefit the common people.

### Du Ge's Corpse Buried Yesterday

The corpse of Du Ge, the legal advisor to the French Municipal Council who died from being assassinated, was given a grand funeral yesterday morning in Ba. At 9:00 AM, his coffin was moved to the St. Peter's Catholic Church on Rue Lupan, where Father Jihman held a memorial mass. Mr. Felipe, the Director-General of the Public Works Department, was also present. After the mass, Du Ge's coffin was transported to the public cemetery in Lujiawan for burial. Representatives from the French Embassy, Consulate, Police Department, Municipal Council, and Public Works Department, as well as key members of the French army and navy stationed in Shanghai, held the ropes. The French police force provided protection along the way. During the burial, Father Tianpus performed the ceremony. After the ceremony, the French Consul-General, Majieli, delivered a speech and posthumously presented a gold medal as a token of mourning and honor.

### French Police to Auction Old Goods

The French police will auction off old clothes, scrap iron, and other items at 2:30 PM on Tuesday, the 24th of this month, at 28 Rue Sévérine.

### The Charity Relief Shelter Opened Early Yesterday - Sudden Cold Weather Causes Many Poor People to Freeze to Death in the Streets - Charity Association's Winter Clothing to be Distributed in a Week - New Pharmaceutical Businesses Sell White Rice at Low Prices - The Scene is Extremely Tragic

The weather has slightly warmed up since yesterday. According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the lowest temperature last night rose to above 30 degrees Fahrenheit, which is much warmer than the previous day. However, as a result of the cold wave hitting the city, the number of frozen corpses in the streets has increased sharply. According to reports from the Pushan Villa and Tongren Fuyuantang, over two hundred corpses, large and small, were collected and buried on the 18th alone.

The Relief Shelter Opened Early Yesterday

The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association has been preparing for the establishment of the relief shelter for some time. The mat sheds built on the Yan Family Residence in Difeng Road are now complete, and all the beds have been installed, accommodating 1,600 people. According to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency who inquired with the association, due to the sudden drop in temperature in the past two days and the daily deaths of poor people from freezing, the association started to receive poor people yesterday. Yesterday alone, more than two hundred people were taken in. From now on, the association will take in as many people as possible up to the full capacity. After being admitted to the shelter, the poor people will first take a bath and have their hair cut. Then, they will be given cotton clothes and trousers made by the association to change into, in order to maintain hygiene. Those who are sick will be treated, and those who have bad habits will be helped to quit, so that they can support themselves after leaving the shelter in the future. Regarding the daily sustenance of the above-mentioned poor people, the association has also stipulated two meals a day: lunch at 12:00 noon and dinner at 5:00 PM, with each meal providing enough food for them to eat their fill.

Actively Preparing to Distribute Steamed Buns

In addition, the association will separately distribute clothing and rice, as well as steamed buns and ginger soup. Last year, hundreds of thousands of people received these items. This year, the prices of rice and flour have soared to unprecedented levels, and the poor cannot make a living. Therefore, the distribution of steamed buns is extremely urgent. The association has already started to work on it and has sent a letter to Director-General He of the Public Works Department to find a location. Once the location is found, the distribution will begin. However, the expenses required for the above items are very large and depend entirely on donations. There is no shortage of enthusiastic philanthropists in Shanghai, and it is hoped that they will generously donate to benefit the poor. If there are donations, they can be directly sent to the association's office at No. 35 Renji Hall, Yunnan Road.

Charity Association Distributes Winter Clothing Coupons

Since the Shanghai office of the China Charity Association for Children started soliciting donations for winter clothing for those in need on the 20th of last month, the deadline was originally yesterday. According to the association's statistics up to yesterday, it has received donations of 23,000 yuan in winter clothing money, more than 200 new cotton clothes, and more than 800 old cotton clothes from all walks of life. The association originally stipulated that each set of new cotton clothes and trousers cost six yuan, but now, in order to increase the quantity, it has decided to invite merchants to bid tomorrow morning to rush the production of 2,000 sets of cotton clothes and trousers, which can be made and distributed in a week. The solicitation period has been extended to the end of the year. In order to distribute the clothing universally and eliminate all malpractices, the association has sent staff to four districts, including Avenue Eduard VII, Avenue Dubail, Zhaojia Ferry, and Xujiahui, to conduct on-site investigations, first distributing winter clothing tickets to homeless street children and impoverished households, and then issuing winter clothing based on the tickets. Any educational organization that needs winter clothing for children can submit a list of children, and the association will investigate and distribute the clothing according to the list. The association also welcomes people from all walks of life to participate in the distribution and hopes that people from all walks of life will pay attention to needy children at any time and apply for distribution on their behalf. Currently, more than one hundred people have been reported and issued.

New Pharmaceutical Businesses Sell White Rice at Low Prices

The temporary committee for assisting the poor, organized by the New Pharmaceutical and Pharmaceutical Industry Association, has started selling white rice at low prices at the Qianjiang Guild Hall at the intersection of North Henan Road and Wenjianshi Road, at ten cents per pound, with a limit of two pounds per person. Since 9:00 AM yesterday, lines of people, two abreast, stretched from Wenjianshi Road, west from North Shansi Road to East to North Henan Road. The number of people was over a thousand, winding forward, the scene was extremely tragic, and those at the end lamented that they might not get any.

### Memorial Service for Shen Menglian's Family

Shen Menglian of Fengxian died of illness at his Shanghai residence on October 19th. The Pudong Fellow Villagers Association, Minhang Guangci Hospital, and other organizations held a memorial meeting at the Pudong Building on the 21st of last month. His family held a memorial service at the same location yesterday. Over a thousand people, including Shen's relatives and friends and personnel from relevant organizations, attended, including Huang Jinrong, Huang Yanfang, Chen Taoyi, Pan Zhiwen, Chen Zixin, all the staff and students of Minhang Guangci Hospital, and the Bi Liang Alumni Association. There were also public sacrifices from the funeral committee and the Minhang Guangci Hospital Alumni Association.

### Amount of Paper Money Issued by Japan in China

According to the English-language Financial and Commercial Daily, as of the first half of this year, the amount of paper money issued by the Japanese side in China was: 560 million yuan in banknotes from the "United Reserve Bank of North China", 60 million yuan in banknotes from the "Mengjiang Bank" in Northwest China, and 5 million yuan in "Hua Yu Coupons" in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. In addition, there were Japanese military scrip worth 600 million yuan. In total, the two items, Japanese yen banknotes (military scrip) and "Hua Yuan" banknotes (United Reserve Bank coupons), amounted to over 1.2 billion yuan.

### Banks to Settle Interest Today - New Year's Holiday for Three Days

As the end of the lunar year of the Republic of China 29 is approaching, the banks will begin to handle the settlement of interest on both savings and commercial accounts starting from the 20th, and will extend their internal office hours according to the business of each bank. According to past practice, all uncontracted loans must be repaid before the end of the lunar year. Borrowing businesses have been in contact with the banks and will close for three days from January 1st of next year, and will resume business as usual from the 4th.

### Principal and Interest on Shanghai Reconstruction Public Bonds Due - HSBC Bank Pays in Full - Pier Donation Income as Principal and Interest Fund - Collection Still in Accordance with Contractual Provisions

The Shanghai Municipal Government issued 6 million yuan in national currency for the Shanghai Disaster Area Reconstruction Public Bonds in November of the 21st year of the Republic of China. The 16th repayment of principal and interest has been paid by HSBC Bank starting December 16th. The principal of 120,000 yuan, as well as the accrued interest, are fully paid in legal tender, and the payment of principal and interest has not been suspended due to the fall of Shanghai. The pier donation income is the principal and interest fund for this public bond. The pier donations in the public concession are still handled in accordance with the contractual provisions. It is reported that the underwriter, Jardine Matheson, expressed admiration for the Chinese government's maintenance of credit, which allows the interests of bondholders to be maintained.

Shanghai's "Times" newspaper reported that the shipping industry in the city was abuzz yesterday (the 18th) with rumors of a large number of Norwegian ships ceasing to be rented to the Japanese. In the current special wartime situation, officials can neither confirm nor deny this rumor, but all parties agree that Norway's move is of great significance in both commercial and political terms.

The Cessation of Rentals is Unconfirmed

Since Germany occupied Norway, the Norwegian government moved to London, and its directly affiliated Norwegian Shipping and Trade Committee requisitioned all Norwegian ships for direct control, working closely with the British government, as did other Allied countries. There is no official news in Shanghai regarding the cessation of Norwegian ship rentals to the Japanese. The rental of Norwegian ships is negotiated directly between the applicant and the Norwegian Shipping and Trade Committee, and then transferred to Shanghai. The Norwegian consulate in Shanghai has not yet received news of the cessation of Norwegian ship rentals to the Japanese and can only infer changes in the lessee from the arrival of Norwegian ships in Shanghai.

Great Importance Attached by All Parties Here

Currently, only two Norwegian ships are regularly sailing to Shanghai under Japanese charter, and no changes in tenants have been seen. In view of the recent political changes and the close connection between the British and Norwegian governments, and the fact that Britain needs more merchant ships, the rumor of Norwegian ships ceasing rentals is taken seriously by the general public. The number of Norwegian ships rented by the Japanese is uncertain, but it is known to be quite large, as the Japanese have a clear shortage of their own ships, which are insufficient for wartime transportation. There are also many Norwegian oil tankers and cargo ships leased to the Japanese that operate along the Chinese coast. If the rumor of cessation of rentals is true, the Japanese will likely lodge a strong protest. It is heard that the leases of most Norwegian ships rented by the Japanese will expire within three months.

### Details of the Violent Collision Between Two Vehicles on Nanjing Road the Night Before - Japanese Military Truck Cut Through a Red Light - Resulting in a Violent Collision with a Public Bus

The English-language "China Press" reported that last night (the 18th), five Japanese soldiers in a military truck at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road cut through a red light, resulting in a violent collision with a British-owned No. 15 public bus. All the Japanese soldiers were injured and were rushed by ambulance to the Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road. One of them suffered serious head and body injuries and is still (the 19th) being treated at Fumin Hospital this morning.

Life in Danger

The other four soldiers suffered minor injuries to their faces and limbs and were discharged after being bandaged. It is reported that the Public Concession Police Department is thoroughly investigating the case and will likely record the testimony of the four slightly injured Japanese soldiers. After the Japanese truck collided with the public bus, the front wall of the Datong Bank at the corner of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road was also slightly damaged. Oil stains are still visible on the wall this morning, and the glass shards and bloodstains on the road in front of the bank have not yet been cleared.

Not Yet Cleared

The "No Parking" sign erected by the Police Department at the road corner was also knocked down. It is reported that the accident was caused by the Japanese military truck traveling south along Sichuan Road at a speed of 40 to 50 miles per hour. The public bus was traveling along Nanjing Road towards the Bund. According to eyewitnesses, when the Japanese military truck was about to reach Nanjing Road, the traffic light turned red, but the Japanese military truck did not stop and instead accelerated forward, resulting in a violent collision with the public bus, with a loud crash.

Extremely Violent Force

The truck was thrown out and crashed straight into the Datong Bank. The public bus also crashed onto the sidewalk. The driver and conductor were severely shaken. Fortunately, there were no passengers in the bus. Traffic at the site was blocked for fifteen minutes. A fire department ambulance arrived and took the Japanese soldiers to Fumin Hospital.

### Japanese Military Police Informants Held in Shackles to Extort Copper Dealers - Two Criminals Arrested and Escorted for Interrogation Yesterday Morning

Liang Long (24 years old) and Guo Ziliang (23 years old), both from Ningbo, who worked as informants for the Japanese Military Police Yangshupu Team, were arrested by Chinese detective Jin Wanrong and others from the Yangshupu Police Department at the intersection of Meizhou Road and Pingliang Road at around 8:00 PM the night before on suspicion of intimidation, fraud, and robbery. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court to apply for a change of date in accordance with the law. Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the hearing in the Third Criminal Court. Detective Jin Wanrong's report stated that the defendants, yesterday, holding "shackles and Japanese Military Police informant cards, arrested old copper dealers Xu Longxi and Zhou Wanxing and inquired about where they sold the old copper they bought every day. Xu and others then led the two defendants, Liang and Guo, to No. 379 Baoding Road to recover the stolen goods. The owner of the old copper shop, Hang Bingqing, fearing that he would be arrested, was willing to pay 100 yuan to settle the matter, but the defendants were not satisfied and claimed that if they wanted to settle the matter, they would have to increase the amount. The two small vendors, Zhou and Xu, then begged the defendants to release them, promising that they would each pay 30 yuan. Later, when Zhou's wife, Chen, was trying to raise money, the police detected it and sent me to lead the detectives to arrest the defendants. When we investigated with the Military Police, the Military Police only admitted that the defendants were informants of their team. I believe that the defendants were sent to arrest people with instruments of torture to extort money. The police are currently conducting an investigation. Please approve a change of date from your court." Judge Jiang reviewed the situation and briefly questioned the defendants before ordering a change of date. The defendants were all remanded in custody.

### Teenage Thief Released After Repenting

Wang Wenying, the 21-year-old daughter of Wang Zhengjia, the director of Yihua Hospital at 200 Avenue Albert, French Concession, is naturally romantic and does not follow family instructions. She associates with the wrong people and has recently become acquainted with Yu Ziren and Zhu Jinrong, employees of the Six Nations Hotel gambling den. Instigated by Yu and others, she stole three sets of her father's Western suits worth 2,000 yuan and silver cups, and squandered the money she got from pawning them. After Wang Zhengjia found out, believing that she would not repent unless she was given appropriate punishment, he reported it to the police, who arrested Wang Wenying and sent her to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Now, because Wang's daughter has suffered greatly in prison and has expressed repentance, Wang Zhengjia requested that the case be withdrawn at the court hearing yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Fang Tongju, did not oppose it. The court then approved the withdrawal and released Wang Wenying.

### China's Wartime Finances Will Become More Optimistic in the Future - Report by the US Commercial Attaché

According to a report by the US Commercial Attaché in this city to Washington, the Chinese government's expenditures for the year 1940 will reach about 350 million yuan due to high prices and heavy military needs. Due to the impact of the war, tax revenues have declined, and expenditures have exceeded revenues, so wartime public bonds have been issued to make up for the deficit. A total of 120 million yuan in military public bonds and the same number in financial public bonds have been issued this year. The military public bonds were issued in two installments of 600 million yuan each on March 1st and September 1st. The above-mentioned public bonds have not yet been used up, and in September, the US announced a loan of 25 million US dollars to China, and in December, another loan of 100 million US dollars. The UK has also loaned 10 million pounds to China, which, according to the open market exchange rate, amounts to 270 million yuan in legal tender. Recently, there have been reports that the Soviet Union has loaned China 100 million yuan to purchase Chinese tea. According to the Sino-Soviet barter trade, the exchange rate of legal tender is calculated according to the official Chinese exchange rate, so the credit loan of 100 million yuan, calculated according to the black market, also amounts to 50 million yuan. China's wartime finances will become more optimistic in the future.

### Ministry of Finance Orders Recall of Miscellaneous Banknotes - Banknotes Circulating in the Market Are Still Valid

The Ministry of Finance telegraphed the provincial governments, "When the legal tender policy was implemented, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications received banknotes from eight banks, including the Siming Bank, the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, the Zhongnan Bank, the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, the China Industrial Bank, the Zhejiang Xingye Bank, the China Reclamation Bank, and the China General Commercial Bank, which were sealed and stored in local banks. Previously, for the sake of meeting needs, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications were ordered to issue them for use. Now, in order to recover the miscellaneous banknotes, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have redeemed the banknotes issued by the above-mentioned eight banks one by one. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from the banking industry yesterday that the banknotes issued by the above eight banks had long been taken over by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications by order of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee. Although the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have gradually recovered them, the banknotes of the eight banks circulating in the market are still valid."

### 申報 Cup Unprecedented Fierce Battle: Chinese Team Could Have Won But Didn't; Defeat Is Regrettable; 38:35 Lead All the Way, Excellent Performance; Surpassed in the Last Two Minutes

The Shenbao Cup Sino-American Charity Basketball Championship: After a minor setback in the first match, the Chinese team revamped its lineup last night and engaged in the first decisive battle with the American team at the Western Youth Basketball Hall. The Chinese team fielded its best lineup, which indeed refreshed the audience and greatly boosted morale, leading all the way. The American team was completely thrown into a state of panic. In the first half, the Chinese team led by thirteen to eight, a five-point advantage. In the second half, the Chinese team's momentum did not wane. At its peak, it led by as much as twenty-six to sixteen, a ten-point advantage. The Chinese team's performance was so wonderful that it could be called unprecedented. For a time, the atmosphere on the court was so tense that it was almost white-hot. The American team fought like cornered beasts, desperately chasing. At this most critical three-minute mark, Zhang Shaoqing, a key player of the Chinese team, was unfairly penalized out by referee Bratt for a minor matter. Consequently, the American team scored four consecutive points at the end, reversing the defeat into a victory with thirty-eight to thirty-five. The fans and philanthropists who supported the Chinese team were greatly disappointed and sighed in unison. But success or failure is up to fate, not the fault of the battle. What more can be said?

Absolutely Not Discouraged, Continue to Strive

The Chinese team's near-success yesterday was unexpectedly changed in an instant. It was completely unexpected. The Chinese team was in the lead all the way in the first half. In the second half, it led by twenty-six to sixteen, a ten-point advantage. Judging from the momentum of the battle, the excellence of the entire team's performance, and the seamless coordination, the performance was truly the most enjoyable of this competition. Everyone thought that victory was no problem, but the result was another defeat. This is truly what is called fate, luck, and heaven's defeat of us. However, the Chinese team will never regret it. In the second match, it will continue to strive to vent its anger. The gain or loss of the championship is a small matter. It is hoped that enthusiastic fans and philanthropists will continue to support the Chinese team and help it vent its anger.

Leading All the Way by Five Points

The Chinese team started yesterday with Nianhua, Shaoqing, Xuechong, Nanzhen, and Zhenzhong. The American team initially responded with an all-white McLaughlin team. As soon as the two teams were ready, Walter opened the scoring with a free throw. Hengel added to the score. The American team took the lead with three points. Before long, Feng Nianhua scored under the basket. Li Zhenzhong made a one-handed shot. The Chinese team immediately took the lead by four to three. When Hengel re-entered the zone, the American team regained the lead. Nianhua made a one-handed shot. The Chinese team saw another turning point. On the American side, Mertler and Ting Huier were substituted. The battle situation still did not improve, and it was stuck in a stalemate for a full four minutes. During this time, the Chinese team wasted a lot of opportunities and missed many sure shots. After Walter made one free throw, the American team took the lead for the third time, but it was short-lived. The Chinese army immediately won victory after victory. Nianhua, Xuechong, and the three brothers scored in succession. The score increased sharply. In an instant, it was twelve to eight, and from then on, they led all the way. When Hai'er made a free throw, the lemon time arrived, and it was thirteen to eight. The Chinese team took the lead.

Great Momentum, Brilliant Radiance

Changing ends and fighting again, the Chinese team still responded with the original lineup. The American army urgently mobilized new force Cheden. Coach Klaus also personally came to direct the battle. He also added the famous general Carson. The foundation was changed to a military officer team. The dangerous figure Henshawitz also appeared. The combat effectiveness was completely different from before. After the battle, Zhang Shaoqing immediately played a miraculous role. The two sides fought evenly. The situation was flat, but after nineteen to fifteen, the Chinese team showed its edge. In an instant, Shaoqing and Nanzhen made three free throws, and Nianhua made two shots, adding seven points. The American team only made one free throw by Carson and one point. The score became twenty-six to sixteen. The Chinese team led by as many as ten points. The future was bright. Everyone thought that a joyous celebration was expected. Cheers resounded. This was the Chinese team's most prosperous period last night.

Near Success Turns to Failure, Major Change in the Situation

Unexpectedly, changes occurred unexpectedly. In this last ten minutes, the situation took a sharp turn. When Walter and Lu Qi hit like pearls, Zhang Shaoqing found the treasure. Twenty to twenty-eight, still leading by eight points. At this time, Henshawitz suddenly broke through to the center. Wang Nanzhen blocked him head-on. Unexpectedly, in addition to being shot, he also received two free throws. In addition, Lu Qi also scored. In one breath, six points were added, resulting in a close situation of twenty-eight to twenty-six. Misfortune did not come singly for the Chinese team. Zhang Shaoqing also hurt his eye and bled, which inevitably affected his movements. After Xuechong and Shaoqing added three points, although Simpson was penalized off, a tiger left and a wolf came. Ting Huier also went to the front line. Lu Qi chased to thirty-one to twenty-eight. The Chinese team gradually fell into a dangerous situation. The more they made a desperate counterattack, the more Shaoqing was penalized for one point. Then, he rushed in and violated Walter, and was penalized off the field. Although Zhongen was transferred up, Walter made three consecutive free throws. The American team had chased to thirty-two to thirty-one, with a difference of only one point. Although Zhuang Ji wanted to change from defense to offense, it was already impossible. Then, Shahewitz shot to thirty-three to thirty-two, taking the lead. In addition, the god of the ball was not spiritual. Feng Nian again missed the chance to score under the basket. In the long sighs of the audience, Walter caught the ball. As soon as the ball left the basket, the bell rang loudly. The Chinese team lost by a thread and suffered another miserable defeat with thirty-two to thirty-five.

Recently, he has donated more than 2,000 volumes of his late father, the late Sinologist Hu Huaichen's manuscripts, to the library. It is heard that there are many rare copies in this collection of books, all of which were painstakingly collected by Mr. Hu during his lifetime. Their categories are especially unique. One is the songbooks and reading materials for enlightenment in ancient China, with dozens of types, all subjects are available, and occasionally there are Western translations or Mongolian explanations. This so-called "Three Hundred Thousand Thousand" textbook was widely circulated in the past few hundred years. In recent times, historians have paid much attention to it, and Hu's collection is the most complete. One is the Chinese writings of ethnic minorities in the border areas, also with dozens of types, which are not easy to obtain for those who study the history of the spread of our culture. Mr. Hu did not finish sorting it out and died with his ambitions, which is truly regrettable. Other historical materials about folk literature are also numerous. It is heard that the library has now listed this legacy of doctors as a "special collection" and has begun cataloging it for the reference of scholars.

### "Helping"

— Li Song

Because the food rice is about to run out, I entrusted relatives a few days ago to purchase a bag from a familiar grain shop. Of course, the price can be cheaper than ordinary millet shops, and the quantity can be more substantial.

At nine o'clock in the morning, the relative called to inform: "…It has been loaded onto a rickshaw and transported out…It is cheap…Sixty-eight and a half yuan…"…Indeed, the price is much cheaper, after all, you can't do without an "old hand"!

Although rickshaws are slow, they can probably arrive in an hour, but when it was half past eleven, it had not arrived yet, and I couldn't help but become a little suspicious—the weather is cold and the year is approaching its end, a rickshaw driver sending goods alone, don't let anything happen? A bag of rice costs dozens of foreign dollars, which is no child's play!

While eating lunch, someone knocked on the door. I opened the door and saw a coolie holding a piece of paper. The address of my home was written on the paper. I thought that the rice had been delivered, so I told him to carry it in; however, I poked my head out and looked outside the door, where there was a rickshaw and rice. When I asked him, he said: "The rice was detained by the brothers with flat-topped hats and long guns, because there was no stamp on the delivery vehicle, and the owner of the goods had to go." I knew very well what colleagues these were, but if I didn't go, the goods would not be delivered, so I had no choice but to limit myself to going to see and handle the matter.

The rice cart was parked on the side of the road, and I was fortunate enough to have a "brother" assigned to guard it. When we met, I had to give a smile first, and then the negotiation began.

"Are you the owner of the goods?" That "brother" asked bluntly.

"Yes! Yes!" I could only say yes.

"Where did you buy the rice from?"

"I bought it from ×× grain shop."

"Why isn't there an invoice?"

"Because it was driven out of the warehouse (stack), the receipt has already been handed over to the warehouse, the rickshaw is delivering the goods with the delivery slip, so there is no invoice."

"Why is there no stamp? Now "the above" has an order to check the stamp tax. Without a stamp, you will be fined!"

"Probably the store didn't know the rules here, and forgot to put it on. Can you please "old fellow" be a little lenient?"

"That won't do!"

"Hey… just be casual…"

"I can be casual, but other brothers" can't be casual—"

"Please help me!"

"I will always help where I can help, everyone has a "number," right?"

"Of course! Of course!" So my hand couldn't help but reach into my pocket, took out two flower paper, "This is a small token, please "old fellow" and the "brothers" have a cigarette, a small token! Sorry! Sorry! Help me!"

"Okay, okay, not next time!"

"Yes! Yes!"

Thanks to his "help," I passed this big hurdle, and I spent two dollars to finally preserve a bag of white rice, great luck!

Continuing to move forward, the rickshaw driver was sweating, but he kept complaining for me, he said: "I have been pulling rickshaws for more than ten years, but I have never encountered this kind of thing." However, things were not only this, and then came the "inspector," without badges or markings, only wearing a "tiger skin," but also came to inquire: invoice? Stamp? It was still the same old routine, but I was "sensible" and handed over another flower paper with a "handshake." "Sorry, please help me" was also a big routine, and only then did I pass the second hurdle.

With great difficulty, I entered the alley, the rice was carried into the house, two yuan for the rickshaw puller, five jiao for wine money, a total of five yuan and five jiao, but things have already come to this, so I can only admit that I was unlucky. But looking back, experiencing this kind of thing can also invisibly increase a lot of "knowledge."

### Throw Garbage into the Bin

(5) Love Birds in Mandarin Duck Lake

It was nearly noon when Chen Wozi sent away a friend. In his small Langhuanzhai study, he held a scroll in his hand and sat silently, burning incense. Suddenly, the study servant reported that a guest was asking to see him. Chen Wozi asked who it was and if he had a visiting card. The study servant replied: "The visiting guest has no visiting card, he only said that he was introduced by Mr. Hou Fangyu from Jinling." Chen Wozi was arrogant by nature and did not like to receive outsiders. Now that he heard that it was introduced by Hou Fangyu, he nodded and said: "Please invite him in." Before long, the study servant led in a beautiful young man with a face like jade and luxurious clothing. He bowed deeply to him as a greeting. As soon as Chen Wozi saw this beautiful young man, although he came suddenly, his appearance seemed familiar, but he couldn't think of it for a moment. So he invited the young man to sit. The study servant offered fragrant tea. Chen Wozi then asked the beautiful young man his name. The beautiful young man said: "My name is Xu Huan, I have long admired your public name, so I asked Mr. Hou to introduce me, and I came to visit you especially." Chen Wozi said: "Do you have a letter?" The beautiful young man shook his head and said: "I did have one, but I lost it on the way. Moreover, there is also an important matter for me to see you this time. Mr. Hou wants me to say it to you face to face, so that it will not leave any traces." Chen Wozi asked: "What is the matter?" The beautiful young man said: "You are a famous scholar in the world, and you should have a beautiful woman in the world to add fragrance to your red sleeves and serve you with towels and combs. Nowadays, Liu Rushi is a humble woman of the entertainment industry, but she knows poetry and understands the body, and she is beautiful and talented. She is a rare woman among women. She wants to serve famous scholars in the world in her heart, and she wrote a letter to Mr. Hou. Therefore, Mr. Hou entrusted me to come forward today, I don't know if you also think that Liu Rushi is a desirable person?" As soon as Chen Wozi heard these words, he looked at the beautiful young man's face, and then observed that the beautiful young man's waist was graceful, very much like a boudoir person, and he understood a little in his heart. He thought to himself that the falling flowers are intentional, but the flowing water is ruthless. I have already indulged in meditation and avoided the demons of love. How can I fall into the enchanting array myself? I have to disappoint her a little. I entrusted Huang Yuqi to guide Qian Muzhai to meet her in her dressing room, which was originally intended to make their marriage a success. I thought that the only way to get him to Liaoshi was to persuade me, so I didn't have to say it. I just had to refuse sternly to dispel her heart, which is also indirectly promoting the success of Qian and Liu. So his face sank, and he replied resolutely: "Liu Rushi is indeed a beautiful woman in the world, and I am grateful for Mr. Hou's elegant intention to act as a matchmaker. But I have been eager to learn Buddhism in recent years and have cut off all the luxuries. I have no intention of hiding a beauty in a golden house, so I have to live up to the good intentions. I beg you to convey my thanks to Mr. Hou, and thank Rushi, and don't think about me anymore. Chen Wozi's last sentence was very decisive. When the beautiful young man heard it, his face suddenly changed color, his eyebrows furrowed, and he said again: "Is what you said true?" Chen Wozi said: "How dare I lie and offend? My heart is already decided, don't bother me with more words." After saying that, he closed his eyes and issued an order to leave. (15)

### New Year

— Zuo Hui

The glass windows of large companies are decorated with snow scenes, gifts, New Year's cards, and the like, which is a way of telling people: It's New Year's time again. "What about the New Year?" the poor will say; the rich are busy, giving gifts, feasting, playing around... This group of people, who usually eat fish and meat almost every day, are celebrating their "little New Year" there. Now, as Mr. Yang said in the living room: "The end of the solar calendar year is here, we're going to celebrate the solar New Year!"

Mr. Yang has notified all his friends of this good news, telling them to be on time. Mr. Yang wrote a list, estimating that there would be four or five large tables. The living room and front building can't accommodate so many people, so the attic has to be temporarily borrowed as well. As for the dishes, Mrs. Yang has also decided, she said: "It's too much trouble to make the dishes myself, so it's better to just order a few tables. Let's be 'economical' and get the 40-yuan ones!"

Mrs. Yang is the best at coming up with ideas. A recent maid quit because she couldn't stand her many contradictory ideas. So she says it's more convenient to order a few tables of dishes, but in fact, she can't cook at all.

Another guest came. First thing, Mr. Yang clapped a few times and said: "Old [name], we've notified everyone else, but we forgot you. Let me tell you, we're celebrating the New Year!"

"So early?" the guest said.

"Not early," Mr. Yang said with a raised eyebrow, "We're celebrating the solar calendar New Year."

"Solar calendar New Year, that's a new invention." The guest laughed: "Mr. Yang, don't be so busy. After the solar calendar New Year, will you still celebrate the lunar calendar New Year? Otherwise—"

"The solar calendar New Year is for the solar calendar New Year. This is indeed my new invention; but don't worry, the lunar calendar New Year will still be celebrated the same way." Mr. Yang is just so happy that his joint-stock rice shop has made too much money. His company has at least several thousand in bonuses. When the end of the year comes, he just has to wait to collect them. Isn't it great to have fun and treat guests more often! Finally, Mr. Yang added: "This time, let's keep it small and be 'economical'. Next time, we'll do it again in a big way."

"Then my mouth will be happy! Excellent." The guest smiled...

Once, twice, Mr. Yang's two children often ran over to hug my legs and shout: "We're going to celebrate the New Year!"

"New Year," hearing this name, I couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh from my heart: The wealthy people in Shanghai are really smart. Compatriots in other places would never think of these things.

### Starting from "X Ancestor"

— Zuo Zhuan

Although the "poor kid" doesn't want to eat or buy anything, he still has to read the newspaper carefully. Of course, he doesn't flip to the "rental" or "lost" ads in the date section, but the advertisements are unavoidable in my eyes.

Today, I immediately saw a rather "novel" seasoning called "X Ancestor".

The advertisement said: "Inside there are ten-yuan and five-yuan banknotes; ten-pound and five-pound bags of white rice..." and also: "One-yuan, five-jiao, one-jiao, five-fen banknotes in abundance..." After reading it, I couldn't help but be so happy that I was "jumping with joy". Banknotes, white rice, who wouldn't want them? Who wouldn't need them?

Later, after thinking carefully: this "ancestor" can't be "invited back" with just one stick of sandalwood and two strings of long ingots; it also requires money to buy, no money, no chance!

Therefore, I was also reminded of the advertisements for "tonics", "coats", "Western food" and the like that fill the newspapers.

What they say is not wrong: Supplement if the body is weak; wear clothes if the body is cold; eat when the stomach is hungry!

However: Whether I will freeze to death this year is still a question, let alone "tonics"? Being able to have a tattered cotton-padded jacket is already "Namo Amitabha", how dare I hope for a "coat"? A bowl of cold porridge and a piece of pancake, "surpasses building a seven-story pagoda," eating "Western food" would be "a waste of me"!

In fact, after careful consideration, I understand that there is no need for me to shout injustices in a "vicious" way. Advertisements have their own target audience. They were never intended to be seen by a poor kid anyway!

That's really "nervousness".

### Mourning Shen Xiling

— Qiu Yu

Drama Society sends telegram of condolence to Ms. Xiong Hui. Zhou Jianyun and Yu Ling are in charge of memorial affairs.

The news of the death of young playwright Mr. Shen Xiling in Chongqing due to illness has spread to Shanghai. Whether they knew him or not, everyone felt extremely惋惜!

He, Mr. Shen Xiling, had a gentle and quiet temperament and a spirit of diligent study. After he returned from studying in Japan, he took on the installation work for Tianyi Film Company. Because of his rich knowledge and cultivation, he soon became a film screenwriter and director. His first directed work was "The Cry of Women" (starring Wang Ying). His successful works are "Crossroads" (starring Zhao Dan, etc.) and "Shanghai Twenty-Four Hours."

He, Mr. Shen Xiling, was truly a versatile young man. Not only did he have such high achievements in film, but he also made great contributions to the stage. The "Wu Zetian" he directed was sold out for more than a month, almost shocking the theater world. "Dreaming and Dying," which he co-directed with Song Zhi, also left an indelible impression on people.

After "August 13th", he bravely left Shanghai and turned to the embrace of the motherland. In Chongqing, he married the actress Xiong Hui. He found a source of spiritual comfort, and he devoted himself to meeting the important tasks of the times. In China Film Studio, he was one of the most hardworking members.

Who would have thought that such a hardworking artist would leave us so early?

No one among the theater workers in Shanghai who heard this bad news did not feel sorry. The Shanghai Drama Society has sent a telegram to express their condolences to Mrs. Shen, Ms. Xiong Hui. And the film industry may re-screen his works during his lifetime to commemorate him!

While we mourn Mr. Shen Xiling, we cannot forget his hardworking spirit and inherit his unfinished work!

(According to reports, after the news of Shen Xiling's death came, those who knew him and those who did not mourned together. Regarding the memorial affairs, Zhou Jianyun, Yu Ling and other friends in Shanghai have initiated preparations, tentatively setting three methods. (1) Distribute a commemorative special issue in the supplements of various newspapers. (2) Collect Shen's posthumous drama scripts and hold commemorative performances. (3) Use Shen's last film work "Crossroads". Contact theaters for public screenings. However, after a discussion yesterday, the third method had some problems. It is feared that there is no existing copy of the "Crossroads" film. If a new one is to be reprinted, the current market price will be more than two thousand yuan. Preparations for this matter have begun.)

### Diana Ping and Mi Queoya's Dance Postures in "Spring Comes to the World"

### Playing a Song for Xie Qinniang

— Ti Gong

Among the several Kunju actresses who are changing customs and introducing new ideas, Yi Hua seems to appreciate Cao Xueqin very much. In the five-part "Wen Suchen", she was assigned to play the seventeenth concubine, Lin Gu. In terms of appearance, she looks six points like Yuan Meiyun. Her voice is very sweet, and her face is quite expressive. The most rare thing is that she sings a pipa song with great emotion. Originally, the scene of Li Youquan's family "offering the faces of sixteen concubines to Mr. Turtle" was entirely based on Lin Gu's戏膽. This character is lively, and Xin Fang and Lan Fang's plays are set off like lively dragons and tigers. Recalling the first performance of the five-part play this summer, the role was played by a Miss Wang, whose voice was as thin as a rat's squeak. So this scene was made lifeless. I remember that for Lin Gu's pipa song, I had painstakingly composed a tune, and the drummer on the stage, being a fool, had also painstakingly composed the gongchi. It was a pity that when Lin Gu sang it at that time, heaven and earth knew, but no one knew. I stood behind the curtain and listened for three nights in a row, but I couldn't hear a single word. At that time, I was indeed a little resentful, as if wounded. This breath was finally exhaled leisurely last night amid the Cao Xueqin's idle oriole whispers, flower bottom slippery, secluded spring water flowing, and the sound of rushing streams under the beach. Of course, my tune doesn't deserve to be called "literati's gem", but I still cherish it and I still want to deeply thank the "nightingale-like girl's throat" for venting my anger.

### Mobilizing Musical Film Talents "Song of Shanghai" to be Restaged from Christmas Day at the Lyceum Theatre

— Yong Zi

In the Shanghai art scene, film and drama are entering a revival era. Although, due to environmental factors, many things that they want to say and do cannot be brought out, the past achievements, especially in the drama world, are still satisfactory. They fully instilled consciousness into the audience, and also promoted many stage arts.

Recently, people from the film, drama, and music circles have jointly mobilized many talents to stage the song drama "Song of Shanghai" again. "Song of Shanghai" is a four-act song drama, and its songs have become the most popular programs on the radio. The reason is very simple, because every song in "Song of Shanghai" is very beautiful. Composer Zhang Haojun spent more than half a year working on "Song of Shanghai".

This decision, the greatest gain, is the general mobilization of the music world. In the past, enlightened people criticized Chinese music for not being progressive. The biggest obstacle was that talented musicians hid in their own circles and were unwilling to work for the public; they only knew how to study advanced music themselves, and neglected that most people were even more distant from them. This time, young men and women studying music are all voluntarily participating in the performance of "Song of Shanghai". The choir in "Song of Shanghai" is helped by Shanghai's most famous Guangdong Sacred Music Garden.

The actors include Bai Hong, Xia Xia, Meng Na, Yan Hua, Hong Wei, etc. The director is Yue Feng. The excellent talents from the previous "Song of Shanghai" will continue to perform, and the vacancies will be filled by those who study acoustics. Therefore, the success of the performance is predictable.

This performance of "Song of Shanghai" is the first performance after the establishment of the Yueyi Society. The date is the twenty-fifth of this month at the Lyceum Theatre, followed by the performance of China's first opera "Song of the Earth".

### "Children's Paradise" One of the "Zhang Garden" Plans

The Continental Swimming Pool and the adjacent thirty-odd acres of open space (which was once used as the Yalin Olympic Circus) are merged into one place, and Zhang Shankun and Li Zulai invested in taking it over. Recently, Zhang Guanwen has also joined the partnership, and it has been decided to rename it "Zhang Garden". It is said that in addition to the natural scenery dedicated to adult appreciation, a "Children's Paradise" will also be opened, with the latest toys from British and American children's parks purchased to broaden the horizons of children. This is a new organization that combines education and entertainment. It is hoped that the "Zhang Garden" authorities can do more to benefit children. The children on the isolated island are like caged birds, too boring.
