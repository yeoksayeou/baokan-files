Tokyo: The Japanese government has already presented France with what is virtually an ultimatum, demanding that arms shipments on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway cease within two weeks, by January 23. The ultimatum contains a warning that if the French do not stop arms shipments to Chongqing on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, Japanese aircraft will bomb every bridge on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway from Kunming to the Vietnamese border in the north. The ultimatum was submitted to the French ambassador by the Japanese Foreign Ministry authorities this week during discussions with the French ambassador to Japan regarding French assistance to the National Government. (12th United Press Correspondent Tom Papson Dispatch)

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma claimed that the Japanese government is considering a reply to France's note of protest, delivered to Japan on January 5, regarding the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, but "the reply will require a considerable amount of time." Suma said that the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was purely for strategic reasons and had nothing to do with Japanese-French treaties. Suma mocked reports from Shanghai that Japanese officials had issued an ultimatum to France demanding that France stop arms shipments on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, saying, "That news cannot be true." Suma continued, saying that the French are trying to convince the Japanese government that arms shipments on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway ceased months ago and do not want to formally protest the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Japan. (12th United Press Dispatch)

Tokyo: Foreign Minister Nomura met with French Ambassador to Japan Henri in the Foreign Ministry on the afternoon of the 12th to explain the Japanese government's views on the French protest of the 5th regarding the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway.

Editorial

### Peace Rumors Flooding the Market

In recent days, various rumors about peace between China and Japan have been circulating in the Shanghai market. Among them, those that are particularly rejoiced in by gentlemen who engage in zero-capital business are: that the ambassadors of England and other countries have successively gone to Chongqing with Japanese peace terms to persuade the Chinese; that bankers have received telegrams from London indicating that peace talks between China and Japan are in sight; that the market price of Chinese bonds in London has soared because peace terms have been agreed upon; and that foreigners believe that peace will be realized immediately, so Hong Kong capital is fleeing back to Shanghai. The various claims are so outlandish that they border on the mysterious, yet the talkers assert them with certainty. They certainly do not harbor any malice towards the country, and are not trying to undermine the will to resist Japan, but simply hope to seize an occasional good trading opportunity in the cracks.

Speculators are by no means devout pacifists or pillars of the peace movement, but only wish for changes in the status quo and for themselves to be the first to hear the news. Therefore, wherever speculators go, like the market, all kinds of rumors are spread irresponsibly and without concern for accuracy. Not only can it not be said that "there is no smoke without fire," there must be a reason. Moreover, they often contradict the facts. To believe that there is even a grain of truth in market "telegrams" is to be fooled. Market rumors are also not enough to be regarded as reflecting general psychology, to assume that such excitement in the market shows that people yearn for peace, because what they are excited about is trade, not about peace or war.

Amid the spread of various rumors, even people who are not in the market hear and are perplexed, unsure whether to believe or doubt, and running around asking questions. In fact, the overall situation of peace or war brooks no slightest ambiguity, and the key is extraordinarily clear. There is no need to ask, no need to say, only to open your eyes and look at the front lines, look at Chongqing and Tokyo. The war is on the front lines, so only when there are no more war reports from the front lines will there be signs of peace. The command for battle comes from Chongqing and Tokyo, so only when both Chongqing and Tokyo declare a ceasefire and make peace, or one side admits defeat and sues for peace, will the beginning of peace be at hand. Otherwise, no matter where, whether London, Washington, Geneva, or Peiping Nanjing, is filled with the air of peace, it is still useless, because those who control peace and war are not there but in Chongqing and Tokyo. No matter who advocates peace, promotes peace, or persuades for peace, if Chongqing and Tokyo do not accept it, it is still useless, and is only advocacy, promotion, and persuasion. Peace and war are not a posture but an action, not an opinion but a fact, not likes or dislikes, not an affirmation or opposition of right or wrong, but a choice and obedience to factual actions. If you see through this point, you will no longer be perplexed by any rumors.

Who loves war? In fact, no one loves war. Where there is war, there must be peace, so there will certainly be a day when peace is spoken of. There are people who seize the opportunity of war to profit, but only a whole, fair, and lasting peace can give the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people. These few points can be believed as unbreakable truths! According to these truths, various rumors, various illusions, various brewing situations, and various situations can be accurately verified. One can know how to strive under the current situation. To strive under the current situation is not to seize a good trading opportunity in the cracks. Negatively speaking, one must endure sacrifice, so as to grasp the war in order to win a whole, fair, and lasting peace. Positively speaking, one must be diligent, hardworking and thrifty, so as to accumulate the strength remaining from the sacrifices, preparing for the great task of reconstruction after the realization of a whole, fair, and lasting peace. The rumors in the market these days are not worth considering; but the continuous and ongoing exposure of weaknesses by Japan in its international, domestic, and military affairs highlights the infinite brightness of China's future and suggests that the time for brightness is not far off. Because of this, not only can it be predicted that those who speculate and profit from war will face a crisis and that their doomsday is approaching, but it is also confirmed that diligence and thrift are important creeds!

### Serious Situation in Japan at Home and Abroad, Abe Cabinet Inevitably Falls, Difficulty in Selecting Successor to Premiership, Konoe Expresses Unwillingness to Return to Office

Tokyo: With Prime Minister Abe confirmed to resign within one or two days, people across the country are looking to senior officials to find a civilian politician who is willing and able to form a cabinet united by the entire country. It is heard that the military is strongly urging Konoe to take up the post of prime minister again, but Konoe is said to be unwilling. According to Konoe today, many people have visited him, urging him to take on this position, but their purposes are different. In his opinion, the resolution of the "China Incident" must proceed in parallel with domestic policies. However, given the current state of politics and the economy, he believes that greater attention needs to be given to domestic policies. Undoubtedly, the current situation is more difficult than when he was previously in the premiership. He does not know if it will become more and more difficult in the future. It is hoped that the new prime minister, whoever he may be, can form a cabinet that can cope with a long-term war and establish a powerful economic and industrial system based on a wartime economy. Possible candidates for prime minister include former Governor of the Bank of Japan, Ikeda in Bin, former Army Minister Araki, former Privy Councilor Suzuki Kantaro, former Prime Minister Hiranuma, and former Prime Minister Hirota Hiroki. Former Prime Minister and concurrently Minister of the Imperial Household, Ugaki Kazushige, has not been mentioned. It is heard that the military has expressed its opinion that it is not appropriate for an active-duty military officer to take this seat. It is expected that Abe will resign after holding a special cabinet meeting on Sunday morning or Sunday afternoon, after which senior officials will convene a meeting to decide on the successor. Most of the participants in this meeting are former prime ministers. The "Nikkan Shimbun" stated that the financial community is now watching carefully and believes that if a policy of fixing the minimum supply of daily necessities is not adopted as soon as possible, the problems of currency and prices will become increasingly serious. (12th Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo: Reuters has reliable sources that Prime Minister Abe informed each cabinet member this morning after the cabinet meeting of his intention to submit his cabinet resignation to the Emperor. It is likely that this will be realized on Sunday morning. It is heard that each cabinet member has agreed to let him handle everything. Furthermore, according to semi-official Japanese news, the Prime Minister told each cabinet member at this morning's cabinet meeting that the resolution of the China Incident has entered a new phase by Japan's formulation of its basic policy towards China and the new central government. He further urged that the government's administration be placed under a new system in order to revitalize the emotions of the people. This afternoon, the Prime Minister entered the Imperial Palace to report on the political situation to the Emperor and had a private discussion with Privy Seal Minister Yuasa about the political situation. It is rumored that the Prime Minister will enter the Imperial Palace after Sunday's cabinet meeting to discuss the situation with the Emperor, after which the most important political developments will follow. Yuasa may visit Elder Statesman Saionji on Sunday afternoon to seek his opinion on the political situation. (12th Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo: After Prime Minister Abe held a cabinet meeting today, he expressed his final determination to each cabinet minister. In the afternoon, he entered the palace and met with Interior Minister Yuasa, and also expressed this determination to Yuasa. However, judging from the current situation, the actions of former Prime Minister Duke Konoe are the focus of general attention. The overall opinion of the military is to hope that Duke Konoe can seek a renewal of the political situation, handle the incident, and strengthen the domestic economic system. In order to implement this hope, the military seems to be persisting in its efforts, and this is not only the effort of the military, but also the senior officials are expressing the same expectation to Duke Konoe. It is rumored that Interior Minister Yuasa frankly expressed this intention to Duke Konoe, and Baron Hiranuma also strongly stated to the upper echelons of the political world that in order to resolve the situation, there is no one other than Duke Konoe. Although there are also two or three other candidates in the political and financial circles, in view of the intentions of the military and important figures, the voices expecting Konoe to take office are gradually rising. Under these circumstances, the activities of various parties centered on Konoe are becoming more active. However, Konoe himself harbors some apprehension about breaking the deadlock, and is somewhat hesitant about taking office. It is doubtful whether he can comply with the almost unanimous expectations of various parties. However, the Duke's advance or retreat can be decided within these one or two days.

### US Government Closely Watching Developments in Japanese Political Situation; Many US Senators Favor Sanctions Against Japan, Stimson's Calls Echoed in Public Opinion

New York: The "New York Times" claimed yesterday that former US Secretary of State Stimson sent a letter to the newspaper yesterday, requesting that the United States implement the proposal to ban the export of military raw materials to Japan, possessing "powerful and compelling reasons" for the embargo. The newspaper's editorial said, "The newspaper firmly believes that the majority of Americans share the same view as Stimson, that the Sino-Japanese war was 'wholly caused by Japanese aggression.'" (12th United Press Dispatch)

Washington: After former Secretary of State Stimson sent a letter to the New York Times advocating a ban on the shipment of munitions and raw materials to Japan, observers here said that Stimson served as Secretary of State for many years under former President Hoover, has rich diplomatic experience, and is a very influential figure in the Republican Party. The fact that this letter was published before the expiration of the US-Japan commercial treaty is sufficient to reflect the rising anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States. Therefore, the US government will definitely be deeply impressed. However, the State Department has consistently maintained silence regarding the current relations between the United States and Japan. For several weeks, although there have been rumors in Tokyo that US Ambassador to Japan Grew has been talking with Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura, the State Department has not formally announced the details of the exchange of views. Responsible persons said that the government's silence is not a sign of weakness or hesitation. The current US Far Eastern policy is still to promote respect for the various rights enjoyed by other countries under the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. This determination has increased rather than decreased in the past. The US authorities have recently received news from Japan that the Abe Cabinet is facing increasing difficulties. Under these circumstances, the US government should remain silent and take no action for the time being, so as to avoid completely closing the door for the US and Japan to dispel suspicions and make peace. After the US-Japan commercial treaty expires on the 26th of this month, the United States can ban munitions and other items from being shipped to Japan at any time, so there is no need to publicize it in advance. Moreover, judging from the Navy Department's request to Congress for funds to improve the dock facilities on Guam, in preparation for the island's defense, it can be seen that the United States has consistently paid attention to the Far Eastern situation, especially the Japanese issue. (11th Havas Dispatch)

Washington: Many members of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee favor implementing economic sanctions against Japan, but are unwilling to take action before January 26. The proposals to the Foreign Affairs Committee regarding Japan are divided into four types, but most advocate some degree of trade cutoff with Japan. The proposal of Republican Congressman Leech is the most severe, advocating a complete severance of relations between the United States and Japan. At the same time, he hopes that Congress will quickly empower the President to immediately terminate exports to Japan and imports of Japanese goods until Japan withdraws from China. The proposal of Democratic Congressman Stearns calls for the State Department to reconvene the Brussels Nine-Power Treaty Conference to decide on measures to deal with Japan, and advocates terminating the current US-Japan commercial treaty. However, he also argues that the United States should remain neutral in Asia, otherwise it will become an ally of Britain and maintain its interests in the Far East. Furthermore, Democratic Congressman Coffee, usually regarded as the spokesman for the liberal group, advocates authorizing the President to prohibit American ships from sailing to Japan, prohibit American private groups from engaging in trade relations with Japan, or boarding Japanese ships or indirectly assisting Japan's aggression against China. Among them, only Republican Congressman Fisher advocates concluding a new commercial treaty with Japan, but Fisher also advocates terminating the mention of scrap iron, waste steel, and tin to Japan. (12th United Press Dispatch)

Washington: Washington State Democratic Senator Schwellenbach said in a speech to the National Democratic Women's Association last night that "the US government" will stop trade with Japan after the US-Japan commercial treaty expires, as a sanction against Japan for violating the Nine-Power Treaty. If the United States stops supplying Japan with munitions and other items, the Japanese war against China will collapse within a few months. After January 26, we can also have an opportunity to wash away our own violation of the Nine-Power Treaty. (12th United Press Dispatch)

### Stimson's Article Resented by Japanese

Tokyo: A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today spoke at a regular press conference about a lengthy article by former US Secretary of State Stimson in the "New York Times" regarding the situation of the US-Japan treaty, and specifically criticized the passage in Stimson's article urging the United States to reject any movement to conclude a new commercial treaty with Japan until Japan makes more specific guarantees about its program in Asia. He said that Japan has clarified its purpose at any time when it is making every effort to safeguard the interests of third countries in China. Stimson's claim that American sentiment towards Japan is becoming increasingly negative is an exaggeration. Judging from the American opinions represented in the "New York Times" and the "New York Herald Tribune", they do not oppose the conclusion of a temporary commercial treaty with Japan, and the two newspapers even expressed the hope that a temporary commercial treaty would be concluded with Japan before the expiration of the existing commercial treaty on January 26. (12th Reuters Dispatch)

### Dr. Baker's Observation: The Sino-Japanese War Will Not End for Three Years; Victory Will Surely Belong to China

New York. Dr. Baker, President of the Shanghai International Relief Committee, declared yesterday to the Church Committee for China Relief that the Sino-Japanese War would require another three years to end, and the need for relief funds would last even longer than that. Post-war reconstruction would be more important than the current relief efforts. The Japanese army has been fighting in China for thirty months, but it has not been able to establish any "occupied zones." Except for the areas where Japanese troops are stationed, all other parts of China are under the control of the National Government. (United Press dispatch from the 12th)

### Soviet Newspaper Analysis: Japan's Economic Difficulties

Chongqing. A dispatch from Moscow reports that the Soviet Red Army's newspaper published an article analyzing the economic difficulties of the Japanese army in the third year of its war of aggression against China. It claims that the war has led to a reduction in Japan's industrial production and foreign trade. In the first nine months of last year, Japan's foreign trade recorded a deficit of 400 million yen. Japan cannot profit from the European war because the war of aggression against China has already imposed significant economic pressure on Japan. Japan is not only unable to deliver goods ordered by European belligerents, but also needs to import machinery and raw materials from abroad to boost its wartime industries. The trend of declining cotton imports from India to Japan poses a major threat. After Vietnam adopted import restrictions, Japanese goods also failed to gain a market in Vietnam. As for trade with Africa and South America, it faces military risks and competition from Britain and the United States. The same is true for trade with India and Australia, as those markets are controlled by Britain. Negotiations for a new US-Japan commercial treaty are facing difficulties. Since the outbreak of the European war, Japan's reliance on the United States has only increased. In October 1939, imports from the United States accounted for 44% of Japan's total imports. The United States, aware of Japan's weakness, has made several demands regarding American interests in China, further strengthening its naval power in the Pacific and imposing an embargo on military supplies to Japan. In light of the above, Japan's foreign trade is in a very difficult situation. The recent statement by Toyotaro Yuki, Governor of the Bank of Japan, that Japan will prosper because of the war is unfounded. (Dispatch from the 11th)

### Kung Hsiang-hsi Hosts a Banquet for the Soviet and Turkish Ambassadors

Chongqing. Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Kung Hsiang-hsi, has been hosting banquets for Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin and Turkish Minister Şevket Fuat Keçeci and their wives for several days. The guests and hosts had a pleasant conversation. (Dispatch from the 12th)

### The Soviet Union Pays Attention to Chinese Resistance Literature

Chongqing. News from Moscow indicates that the Soviet people are very interested in various news from China and heroic stories of Chinese resistance against aggression. Soviet newspaper readers pay particular attention to the works of Chinese writers. Various Soviet literary magazines feature translations of Chinese poems, essays, and sketches in each issue. The most famous magazine, "Znamya," recently published a poem by Chinese writer Xiao Mei (transliteration) titled "Goodbye, but Not Farewell." This poem became popular in the Soviet Union for a time. "International Literature" magazine pays the closest attention to Chinese works. Its latest issue excerpted the book "North China Front" by the famous British reporter Halbert Anm. The publishing plan of the State Literary Publishing House also includes a large number of translations of Chinese works. The translation of "(A Chinese Woman)" is about to be published. The original author is Zhuang Zhou (transliteration), depicting the spirit of sacrifice of Chinese women on the front and rear lines. A new book by the young Chinese writer Luo Fanfu (transliteration), "Good Sons of China," is currently being translated. (Dispatch from the 11th)

### Japanese Side Denies Anti-American Movement

Tianjin. It was reported from Peiping that the New People's Society is preparing to launch an anti-American movement in North China when the United States refuses to conclude a new commercial treaty with Japan. A reporter from the American Associated Press asked Nakayama, the Japanese Director of the Tianjin New People's Society, about this yesterday. According to Nakayama, the Tianjin New People's Society has not received such an order. Furthermore, "Why should we be anti-American? The United States has no malice towards China." Regarding the resurgence of anti-British sentiment in Tianjin, especially the anti-British films shown in cinemas, he also deflected responsibility, claiming that it was entirely the result of Chinese anti-British sentiment. It is reported that the posters commonly seen in Chinese cinemas depict Britain as a wolf, with the words "the most insidious, the most cunning, the most cruel wild beast," etc. (United Press dispatch from the 12th)

### German Aircraft Widely Active Along the British Coast; Aiming to Discover Weaknesses in British Defenses; Preparing for Concentrated Attacks in the Future; Germans Claim Four British Ships Sunk

London. German aircraft carried out extensive bombing raids on the east coast yesterday. Experts believe that the bombing was an organized and coordinated attack, and also the most extensive aerial activity since the start of the war. The German aerial activity aimed to discover weaknesses in British defenses, and then prepare for concentrated attacks in the future. According to the British War Office, the department now hopes to manufacture advanced aircraft, especially long-range aircraft, in order to protect the interests of bombers. (United Press dispatch from the 12th)

London. Yesterday the weather was clear, and German planes flew to Britain in large numbers, covering a wider area than ever before since the start of the war. German planes crossed the coast at six locations, from Scotland to southeastern England, but did not drop bombs. British anti-aircraft batteries fired into the air, and fighter planes also took off to intercept them. A house near Newcastle was slightly damaged by anti-aircraft shrapnel. Coastal residents either took refuge in bomb shelters or left their homes to watch the aerial battle. The visibility was not very good, but black smoke from exploding shells could be seen in the sky. (Reuters dispatch from the 12th)

London. News of aerial activity off the British coast was received here again today. It is reported that a German plane, chased by a British plane, flew over Yorkshire and escaped to sea. When the German plane crossed the coastal rocks, machine gun fire was heard. The British plane suddenly descended to attack, and the German plane flew north and disappeared. The British plane soon returned, and a squadron of British bombers appeared over the coast and flew out to sea. Distant artillery fire could be heard faintly, and several planes were seen flying over various coastal cities in the area. A German plane, probably a Heinkel, flew over the Suffolk coast and was fired upon by anti-aircraft guns before withdrawing. In the evening, anti-aircraft batteries on both sides of the Thames Estuary in Kent and Essex opened fire on a plane, believed to be a German plane, flying at a very high altitude. The plane flew over the Essex coast and disappeared. In the morning, residents in central London heard artillery fire coming from the Thames Estuary. (Reuters dispatch from the 12th)

### The United States Should Maintain a Strong Navy; To Back Britain and France When Necessary; Stark Expresses His Views

Washington. Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations of the United States Navy, told the House Naval Affairs Committee yesterday, "The United States must expand its military to prepare for the event that the Allies are defeated, to be used as a 'defense against strong enemies.'"

### US Government Promotes Reciprocal Trade Agreement Policy; Hull Delivers Speech Strongly Defending It

Washington. Secretary of State Hull recently delivered a speech to the House Rules Committee, strongly defending the government's policy of concluding trade agreements with various countries based on the principle of reciprocity, and requested that the government's privilege to sign such trade agreements be extended. He said, "We now have two paths to follow. One is to follow in the footsteps of other countries and head down the road to bankruptcy and disappointment. The other is to blaze a new trail, striving to benefit the progress, prosperity, and lasting peace of our country and all countries in the world." Regarding the "Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act" established in 1930, after Hull finished speaking, the members of the committee asked many questions, requesting answers. The most important question was whether the burden on domestic producers would be increased after the United States made many concessions in tariff rates under this trade agreement. However, judging from the overall situation of today's debate, most of the members were arguing with each other based on party affiliation, and not purely discussing the value of the policy. Because the general election is approaching, the remarks of the members of various parties are more excited than usual. (Havas dispatch from the 11th)

### Reports of Hitler Preparing to Mediate the Soviet-Finnish War to Simultaneously Preserve Friendships with Italy and the Soviet Union, and to Prevent Britain and France from Sending Troops to Northern Europe; Italy Denies Volunteer Soldiers Have Arrived in Finland to Assist in Combat

London, from a correspondent of the Daily Express stationed in the Dutch capital: Hitler is currently pressuring Stalin to present peace terms to Finland. He states that if the Soviet Union is willing to comply, he is prepared to step in and mediate. It is said that the Soviet government responded by stating that if the Soviet Union could acquire naval bases on the Finnish coast, gain the right to utilize the northern Finnish port of Petsamo, and revise certain border lines with Finland, then negotiations could proceed, and the plan to conquer Finland could be abandoned. According to the correspondent, Hitler's actions are intended to achieve three objectives: First, a peaceful settlement between Finland and the Soviet Union is the only way to simultaneously preserve the friendships between Italy and the Soviet Union with Germany. Second, Hitler believes that Britain and France will use the Finnish war as a pretext to send troops and transport armaments to the Scandinavian Peninsula, and he wants to avoid this. Third, Germany urgently needs raw materials from the Soviet Union, but this will be impossible if the Finnish-Soviet war continues. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

Helsinki: The first unit of Italian volunteer soldiers fighting for Finland has arrived here and will be named the "Garibaldian Legion." There is now credible reason to believe that some Soviet troops have been surrounded in northern Finland. Finnish ski patrol teams have severed several key routes between Salla and Kemihaave to Samihaave, trapping approximately 18,000 Soviet soldiers 20 miles ahead of the cut-off points. Finnish forces are advancing on both sides and in the center, placing the Soviet troops in a clear disadvantage. It is reported that 35,000 to 40,000 Soviet reinforcements are now departing from the railway terminus in Kandalaksha, rapidly moving to provide support. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

Helsinki: According to various Italian sources, the rumor that a group of Italian volunteer soldiers, named the Garibaldian detachment, arrived here yesterday from Italy to assist Finland in its resistance is not true. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

London: A shipment of Italian munitions, transported by Germany to Finland, was detained en route by German authorities. It was later returned after Italian protest. Political figures here commented on this matter, noting that it is worth observing whether Italy is sending munitions to Finland through other routes and to what extent Italy is maintaining an independent stance regarding the German-Soviet alliance. In their view, Italy's rhetoric of aiding Finland is merely to defend its position as a pillar against Bolshevism, hoping to attract the Balkan Peninsula countries. Regarding Italian volunteers going to Finland to assist in combat, it is confirmed that this is happening, and several dozen have arrived in Finland, but so far, the total number is only several hundred. The direction of Italy's current foreign policy remains ambiguous. Some pessimists even believe that Italy is using the pretense of pursuing an anti-Bolshevik policy to attract Southeast European countries as much as possible, gradually distancing them from Western European countries. This action may have been instigated by Germany. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

### Currency System in Guangzhou Becomes Increasingly Chaotic

The situation caused by merchants refusing to accept Guangdong Province banknotes and the exchange rate of legal tender being only 60% of the Japanese military scrip has not improved today. Currently, only rice shops accept legal tender, but at double the price. According to sources here, this trend is due to manipulation by Chinese individuals to prevent legal tender from falling into Japanese hands and being used to purchase foreign exchange.

### Japanese Troops in Guangdong Commit Atrocities of Forced Labor Recruitment, Causing Extreme Harassment in Nanhai, Sanshui, and Huaxian Counties; Tens of Thousands of People Have Been Recruited from Guangzhou

Guangzhou Correspondent: The Japanese troops invading Guangdong have recently been severely lacking soldiers, unable to replenish their forces. Adding to this their ambition of seizing Shaoguan, they are conducting large-scale recruitment of forced laborers to drive them to work. However, most of those recruited are unwilling, leading to repeated tragic incidents. The situation is recorded as follows:

Regarding Various Counties:

Japanese troops in Jiujiang, Taiping, and other areas have forcibly recruited over a hundred farmers from Jizan, Dagang Market, and other places since early December. They continue to appear in various villages from time to time, arresting and forcibly returning to the military headquarters any shepherd boys or farmers working in the fields and sandbanks. During this harvest season, farmers, due to their livelihoods, have no choice but to desperately harvest rice. Whenever Japanese troops arrive, they abandon their crops and flee. Among those who are unable to escape and are forcibly recruited, it is estimated that over three hundred people have been taken from various areas of Nanhai County between the 18th and 20th. In Sanshui County, during the market days in places such as Dagao Market and Xicheng Market, many villagers attend the market. Unexpectedly, Japanese troops suddenly arrived and surrounded the market, forcibly recruiting any strong young men they encountered. People scrambled to escape, and shops hurriedly closed, causing great disorder. It is estimated that over fifty people were taken from Dagao Market and thirty people were taken from Xicheng Market. The Japanese troops tied the hands of those recruited with long ropes and escorted them back towards Taiping. Japanese naval vessels in Jiujiang also frequently sailed to Shatou, Zhoucun, Longchi Ouxiang, and other places to harass the population. Currently, in various areas of Nanhai and Sanshui counties, the residents are in a constant state of fear. On the Guanghua Highway line, in areas such as Nicheng and Xiaogang, the Japanese troops also conducted large-scale arrests of strong men and women from various villages. The plainclothes unit of the Chinese army's Ye Department, upon learning of this, immediately divided into four groups and launched a tight encirclement and ambush of Nicheng and other places. The Japanese troops were suddenly attacked and fled hastily towards Xicun, abandoning dozens of rifles and suffering dozens of casualties. The Chinese side sacrificed only a few people. Afterwards, the Japanese troops fled to Nicheng, claiming to be searching for guerrillas, and arrested dozens of civilians from nearby villages, taking them back to the city for interrogation. Currently, the Japanese troops have extremely strict precautions in various villages in the area.

Regarding Guangzhou:

The Japanese troops' recruitment of forced labor has been ongoing for nearly a month, and the number of people recruited has reached tens of thousands, with an unlimited demand. As a result, the residents of Guangzhou dare not leave their homes, and the city presents an even more desolate and desolate scene. Recently, with no one left to recruit in the city, they have turned to recruiting in various rural areas during market days, causing the temporary suspension of market days in nearby rural areas. However, as the Japanese troops need a certain number of forced laborers daily, on the 15th, they dispatched a large number of Japanese troops to villages such as Chaju and Shanzhai in Huadi to forcibly recruit, taking a total of over two hundred villagers. On the 16th, they again dispatched troops to Yuanxi, Xichang, Zengbu, Sanyuanli, Sanshengtang, and other places to forcibly recruit, taking a total of over one hundred and seventy villagers. As a result, when the villages hear that Japanese troops are approaching, they seek ways to escape, leaving the chickens and dogs unsettled. Harvesting in the countryside is now done by female laborers, and men dare not cultivate in the fields. In the Guangzhou market, street vendors have now uniformly been replaced by women carrying babies on their backs to sell goods on the roads. The reason for carrying babies on their backs is to prevent even female workers who are considered strong from being recruited. It is feared that the situation will become increasingly severe. From the 18th, it became even more intense. On the evening of the 19th, the Japanese troops suddenly issued an order to the puppet Guangzhou Municipal Police Department, requiring them to recruit eight thousand strong men within two days and hand them over to the Gendarmerie Headquarters for distribution and use. After receiving the order, the puppet police department immediately ordered all nineteen puppet police stations in the city, as well as their respective self-defense corps, to dispatch puppet police and supervise the self-defense teams to recruit the required number within the time limit. As a result, an unprecedented tragic scene of forced labor recruitment began on the morning of the 18th. After dawn on the 18th, the puppet police and self-defense teams set out in different directions, searching and forcibly recruiting on major roads and in places where laborers often gather, such as fish and vegetable markets. However, after repeated forced labor recruitment in the city in recent days, the residents have become like frightened birds. Ordinary people generally do not go out unless necessary, and even general street vendors would rather endure hunger than temporarily hide in their homes to avoid being forcibly recruited. Only a portion of those who have reached the end of their rope and can no longer endure venture out to earn a living, but they do so with trepidation, constantly guarding against recruitment, or taking more secluded inner streets. Unexpectedly, the puppet police, in order to shirk their responsibilities, set up a tight net and intercepted people everywhere, so even those who take detours cannot escape. Around 9:00 AM, those recruited were being escorted back to the puppet police stations. The wives and children of those recruited, upon hearing the news, wailed in front of the puppet police stations, pleading for their release. Others met on the road, clinging to their clothes and crying in sorrow, a scene so tragic that even those with hearts of stone would shed tears. The puppet police ignored them and forcibly took them away. If they encountered Japanese troops, they would be severely beaten. For a time, the entire city was shrouded in sorrow. Due to the spread of rumors, most men dared not walk in the city. The streets were mostly filled with women. By the afternoon of the 18th, the puppet police, seeing that there was no one left to recruit on the streets and that the number of eight thousand had not yet been reached, began to forcibly recruit from shops. The Japanese troops also supervised the forced recruitment. As a result, most shops closed their doors and stopped operating, and many tea houses also closed. The streets were desolate, and pedestrians disappeared. The puppet police then waited on the outskirts and the Bund for villagers entering the city from various villages and for those returning from elsewhere, and forcibly recruited them. As a result, even fish and vegetable vendors dared not go out to buy or sell, and most food supplies disappeared from the market. Except for frail women and children, there were hardly any men to be seen on the streets. By the 20th, the Japanese and puppet troops were still recruiting forced labor as they had on the 18th and 19th. However, as the news had spread to various villages in the neighboring provinces, those coming to Guangzhou also disappeared. The entire Guangzhou resembled a dead city. By 4:00 PM, the Japanese and puppet soldiers and police who had been dispatched to recruit forced labor began to withdraw. In front of each puppet police station, signs were posted with words such as "The quota of forced labor has been met, recruitment has stopped." The residents, initially fearing that it was a trick to lure them out for forced recruitment, still warned each other not to go out. Later, seeing that there were no Japanese and puppet troops on the streets, they cautiously ventured out to buy necessities. Around 5:00 PM, a small number of shops reopened for business. After this three-day large-scale forced labor recruitment, the residents, realizing that it was difficult to stay in the tiger's den, moved elsewhere. Those who had just returned to Guangzhou from elsewhere moved away again. Therefore, on the 21st, the number of people leaving Guangzhou was endless. It is reported that the thousands of people who were recruited were transported elsewhere by ship, but it is not known exactly where they were taken.

Furthermore, according to those who escaped from Guangzhou, "Since the outbreak of the war in southern Guangdong, the Japanese troops in Guangzhou have begun recruiting forced labor and have not stopped until recently. I was fortunate enough to escape from the tiger's den this time and come safely to Hong Kong, which is truly a stroke of luck. In this recruitment of forced labor by the Japanese troops, regardless of men, women, old, or young, all are on the list to be recruited. Since the beginning, no fewer than forty or fifty thousand men and women have been recruited. Some are driven to southern Guangdong and Guangxi to transport supplies, while others are driven to the front lines in the northwest and the Yangtze River to build defensive works and transport military supplies. I was recruited two months ago and served as a coolie. The recruited citizens are not given any wages, and the two meals a day are only the leftover cold rice that the Japanese troops eat on the battlefield. They are constantly hungry. In addition to enduring hunger to build defensive works, when there is an intrusion or a counter-offensive by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops use machine guns to supervise them from behind, driving these unarmed coolies to the front lines to serve as cannon fodder. If anyone retreats, they are shot with machine guns. Whether they advance or retreat, they will die. The Japanese troops used this inhuman method in the northern invasion of Sanhui and Luba in Guangdong and in several battles in southern Guangdong. The Japanese and puppet troops call this 'meat fortress' to make the Chinese army have concerns and disrupt the target in order to prolong their lives. This shows one aspect of the Japanese troops' long-term war. In recent battles in the northwest, the Yangtze River, and southern Guangdong, countless civilians have been sacrificed in this way. There are even more unspeakable atrocities. Currently, the forced laborers recruited by the Japanese troops in Guangzhou and the occupied areas, regardless of men, women, old, or young, are subjected to torture if they resist or try to escape. Among the tens of thousands of people recruited in Guangzhou, at least a thousand have been slaughtered by them," he said.

### Order in Changshu City Has Not Yet Been Restored

According to someone who came from Changshu City, it is confirmed that the county seat has been fully open since the 6th, but the Japanese troops, after this attack, are extremely fearful. Therefore, wherever there is a Japanese garrison, sandbags are added. The order in the shops in the city has not yet been restored after this five-day city closure and thorough search. The shops are desolate and the situation is very bleak, as the residents are unwilling to enter the city easily. As for the Japanese troops' casualties, they themselves announced one death and one injury. One of the guerrilla fighters who first launched the attack was disguised as a hunchback and immediately entered Dushu Lane after the attack, escaping by climbing the mountain. Therefore, during the thorough search, the Japanese troops arrested all the hunchbacks inside and outside the city and searched the residents near the foot of Yushan Mountain and the North Gate. Some of those arrested have been released, but a person from a certain village who sells chaff was detained in the city. When he went to the city wall to look for a boat, he was spotted by the Japanese troops, who thought he was related to the attack, and tied him up. First, they burned his hair, and then they burned a red-hot iron skewer and pierced his mouth and nose. Although he has been sent to the guard team, he has been severely tortured and is in danger of losing his life. This proves the cruelty of the Japanese troops' methods.

Stock transactions: 40 shares of Xinxin Company changed hands at a price of 6.2 jiao.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Mediocre

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no upward or downward movement in HSBC's listed prices. The gray market conditions for British and American exchange rates remained consistently mediocre, with thin trading. However, the underlying trend continued to show a slight tightening, mainly due to Sassoon and other foreign firms slightly increasing their purchases. The opening was flat, and the market was quiet and uneventful. Around 10:00 AM, a Western merchant, Sassoon, suddenly increased its purchases of February shillings, followed shortly by settlements for cotton and wheat in March and April. Although the Bank of Japan attempted to offset this with its own sales, the market had already tightened slightly, with British gold reaching 4/8125 and the U.S. dollar reaching 7.90625. Subsequently, buyers became satisfied, but sellers simultaneously disappeared, and the market returned to a sluggish state until the close, returning slightly to 4/828125 and 7.9375.

Around 10:00 AM, a Western merchant, Sassoon, first came to pick up a foreign favorable February British gold 4/78125. Later, because the willingness of foreign banks to supply turned weak, and at that time, foreign firms had some cotton and wheat settlements, the market softened slightly. It is estimated that Sassoon also picked up foreign March British gold 4/75. Subsequently, an importer also settled with Datong Bank and other American banks for March U.S. dollars 7.625 and April U.S. dollars 7.5. At that time, Japanese firms also purchased spot British gold 4/8115 from the Bank of Japan and Yokohama Specie Bank. At the same time, spot U.S. dollars also softened to 7.90625. Afterwards, fewer buyers appeared, and the situation became more stable.

### Gold Market Calm and Quiet

Yesterday's cash gray market situation remained unchanged. The reason is that foreign exchange has been sluggish in recent days, and most parties are holding a wait-and-see attitude. Nothing is enough to influence the market, and it is extremely difficult for a drastic reversal to occur. In terms of yesterday's process, it always hovered. The morning opening was quite flat at 4,080 yuan. It then fell again to a low of 4,077 yuan due to sales by gold firms. Subsequently, the exchange market softened slightly, and a certain money changer and securities firm successively bought in, and the price was pulled up to a peak of 4,090 yuan.

A certain money changer bought 10 liang from a fellow trader for 4,086 yuan. Later, the jewelry firm sold 20 yuan to the securities firm for 4,084 yuan. After this, the securities firm continued to absorb, and then raised the price by 6 yuan. The securities firm bought 20 liang from the gold firm for 4,090 yuan. At that time, the foreign exchange stopped tightening and tended to flatten, and the gold firm came to sell out again, and the securities firm also changed from buying to selling, so it fell. The securities firm sold 30 liang to the money changer for 4,087 yuan, making the noon closing price. The afternoon situation was quieter. First, it rose 2 yuan, and the money changer bought 10 liang from Yu Hao for 4,087 yuan. Shortly after, a certain silver firm came to sell out slightly, pressing down 4 yuan, and bought 20 liang from the money changer for 4,083 yuan. After entering at 2:30 PM, the money changer bought 10 liang from the securities firm for 4,085 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it was up another 4 yuan compared to the previous day. The total fluctuation for the day was 13 yuan. The selling price of the cash firm's own gold brand was several yuan higher than the actual gold, and the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and trading was rare.

Jewelry Gold Remains Unchanged

The exchange price of jewelry gold per liang has remained unchanged throughout. Datong Bank is still holding at 410 yuan, and the new dealer's price is the same as the previous price, with a reduction of about 15 yuan in the buying price.

### Gauze Yarn: Fuda Monopoly, Gauze Prices Unsustainable, Double Horse Drops Another 15 Yuan

The gauze market is sluggish, and the downward trend is intensifying. The actual reason is that the sales channels for spot gauze are narrow, leading to a daily increase in inventory. Although the bulls are holding on tightly, buying and selling still struggle to break free from the market. Now, the American and Indian cotton markets are reacting and declining, making the bulls even more anxious. The market situation is becoming increasingly unsustainable. In this regard, it may be difficult to maintain the 700 yuan mark for 20-count Double Horse gauze. In addition, with the Lunar New Year approaching, general hand-held goods will inevitably be sold off.

Spot silk opened this morning with a renewed downward trend due to the weakness of the European and American cotton markets. There were many sellers in the market. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse was 711 yuan, a slight drop to 710 yuan. Later, with the support of the bulls, there was a slight recovery, rising to 714.5 yuan. However, because the actual position could not progress, it lingered for a long time. By the time the market closed, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate was stable and Fuda was releasing its holdings. The downward trend for 20-count Double Horse gauze resumed, falling to 708 yuan at the close. According to statistics, the total transaction volume for half a day was 1,465 bales. The market price for 20-count Double Horse fell by 15 yuan, Heavenly Girl fell by 15 yuan, and Double Globe fell by 14 yuan. The amount purchased by each group is listed below: Fellow traders 1,300, Hong Kong 140, Ningbo 10, Mainland 15, Total 1,465.

### Local Cotton Follows Foreign Market Downturn, Transactions Also Exceptionally Quiet

Local cotton trading is becoming increasingly quiet, and transactions among fellow traders are also decreasing. The reason is that the firm American and Indian cotton markets suddenly experienced a downturn, causing sentiment to decline accordingly. At the same time, factory demand is weak, and cotton yarn demand is stagnant, with selling prices declining daily. The supply from Northern Jiangsu includes 300 bales of Tonghua cotton, 236 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 620 bales of Beisha cotton. The opening prices for spot cotton are listed below: Taicang cotton 167.00, Guangqin imported 285 bales of Pingguo cotton 165.00, fellow traders imported 150 pieces of Tongcao bales 164.00, fellow traders imported 200 bales of Huocao bales 158.00, fellow traders imported 200 bales of Huoda bales 169.00, Yuan Yi imported 150 pieces of Cao bales 160.00, fellow traders imported 250 bales.

In other news, the New York cotton market has been relatively weak recently. At the opening this morning, the market fell due to speculation and selling. Later, it fell again due to the sharp decline in stock prices and selling by overseas merchants. As a result, the closing price fell by more than ten pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by more than ten rupees. Egyptian cotton fell by more than thirty rupees. Liverpool cotton fell by more than ten pence.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market is becoming increasingly depressed. All parties are unwilling to purchase, resulting in a dead market. Although fellow traders have some interest, they are afraid to take risks due to the huge exchange rate risks. In addition, factory demand is non-existent, so everyone is hesitant to move forward. Japanese manufacturers are also very quiet. However, it is generally expected that foreign cotton trading may turn around in recent days. The factory delivery prices for yesterday's cotton market, converted at a US exchange rate of 7.85, are as follows: 20-count American Middling 228.20, 20-count American Middling Below Grade 223.95, 32-count American Middling 240.50, 32-count American Middling Below Grade 234.70, 42-count American Middling 245.20, 42-count American Middling Below Grade 236.95.

### Grains: Rice Market Unstable Due to Frequent Obstructions to Deliveries

After the rice market shifted to a fluctuating situation, the opening yesterday was still relatively stable. The reason is that there were still few out-of-town merchants selling, and few buyers were purchasing. Although deliveries from the interior arrived daily, the number was not as large as in the previous week, only four to five hundred bags. Moreover, they had to be transferred out of Hongkou, and recently there had been some difficulties, making the amount seem even smaller. Yesterday, it was heard that the issue had been resolved, and that goods could be transferred by river from the Huangpu River. As a result, there were many sellers in the market, with no less than one to two thousand bags of early and late rice from the Southern ports, and thin rice, etc. However, most of them were from the Datong and middle sections, and there were very few special grades. Therefore, general stores were urgently in need of high-quality goods, and their demand for lower-quality goods was only so-so. Moreover, the buying interest was still difficult to loosen quickly. Therefore, domestic rice, whether it was thin粳 or 变元 rice, remained mediocre from morning to noon, with little fluctuation. Only after the foreign rice became tight did it slightly increase by two or three 角. As for various types of foreign rice, the market has recently been dominated by large quantities, so although the morning market was once calm, the sales market suddenly became lively after hearing that the foreign exchange rate had shrunk again. The original bagged goods remained firm and were not released. Only some recycled goods were exchanged between each other. In the absence of sufficient supply, buyers slightly increased their prices to search for goods, which led to an upward trend.

The foreign rice market was still in a flat position in the morning. Later, due to the failure to transport goods unloaded at Hongkou as usual, and the frequent price increases reported from abroad, the market sentiment was mostly upward. New transactions were not properly settled, and recycled original bags were not close. The current foreign rice market has turned from weak to strong, and the market outlook is expected to be two or three 角 higher. However, the demand in this street is very weak, and the rural merchants lack a smooth appetite. The previously ordered goods are still arriving at the port one after another. Yesterday, more than 5,000 bags arrived on the Aksel vessel, and one or two more ships are expected to arrive within the next few days.

### Flour Prices Rise Unabated, Wholesale Prices in This Street Rise Another Two 角, Wheat Reaches Unprecedented High Price

After the wholesale price of flour from Paoche 客盘 reached the 10 yuan mark, each factory once again increased the wholesale price in this street by another two 角 yesterday, changing it to 9.60 yuan. Although the price for 客盘 has not been increased on the surface, the supply has actually been restricted. Therefore, after the 客销 market was once active the day before yesterday, it suddenly turned quiet again yesterday. The environment in the flour market is becoming increasingly favorable. In the midst of the soft rice prices, I never expected the flour prices to rise even faster. The 10 yuan flour price has already been seen, and I don't know what the bottom will be. This is all due to the temporary difficulty in ordering foreign wheat from abroad, and the repeated increases in the selling price of domestic wheat. It is heard that the current flour of the Japanese factory Phoenix brand has also increased by two 角. The futures market has been suspended due to unresolved disputes over buying and selling. Today, 6,500 white bags of flour were exported to Tianjin.

### Building Materials: Water and Wood Materials All Rise in Price

The reasons are reduced supply, increased fuel prices, and the sudden interception of bricks, tiles, and lime. Since the New Year, building materials have generally been more expensive than last year. Due to the many affairs in Europe, the number of ships has decreased and freight rates have increased. Major companies such as Xiangtai are afraid that there will be problems with European freight in the future, and they are unwilling to sell off their Shanghai inventory at low prices and are increasing prices. Various firms are still competing to sell in order to seek the flow of funds, so the market price has not yet reached its peak. The former supply of local pine and fir was cut off, and the Shanghai inventory was limited, so prices rose again and again. Their prices are almost equivalent to those of foreign pine. Although there are occasional arrivals, the number is very small, and the freight is quite high, which is a drop in the bucket and does not help the matter. Moreover, the cost has increased, resulting in a situation of rising prices without falling prices. Most hardware items are foreign goods. Although there has been a lot of construction in Shanghai recently, most of them are ordinary residences. There are few giant buildings and high-rise buildings. The purchasing power of heavy materials and large materials is not weak. Moreover, with the improvement of foreign exchange rates, the market price should have tended to decline. Now, the opposite is true. Not only has it not fallen, but it has also risen. The reason is also due to the deteriorating situation in Europe, and people are optimistic. Both domestic and foreign traders are hoarding and waiting for a good price. The prices of bricks, tiles, and lime were originally raised due to rising fuel prices. The reason for the extraordinary prices is due to the large-scale monopoly of a certain party. Two to three hundred large and small boats of water and wood materials were intercepted in the suburbs of Shanghai. What is the intention? It is unknown. Although this new high price has been created in the market, the goods in the market are still very small. The initial increase in the price of cement was due to the increase in the price of coal. Then, due to the decrease in supply, demand exceeded supply, and sellers took the opportunity to manipulate the market, causing the price to rise again and again, breaking all historical records. (Le)

Wheat: The wheat market was even more expensive yesterday, with the highest price reaching a peak of 17 yuan, which is unprecedented. Various circumstances have created this situation. It is heard that the Huachang purchasing plate has been widened to 16.60 yuan, but sellers are still unwilling to sell more. As a result, only one or two thousand bags were opened. It is estimated that the market hoarding households received about three or four cars, and the selling price has reached a peak of 17 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans Are Rare and Expensive

Soybeans are in short supply due to insufficient supply. Only a small number of Wuhu Road soybeans can be used, which is of no help. Moreover, high-quality goods are extremely scarce. Therefore, Zhongguan goods have been improving in the past two days. High-quality soybeans are rather sluggish, and it is difficult to handle due to the high price. Although there were Dingjiazhou soybeans opened at 20 yuan in the market yesterday, the number was only dozens of bags (sold by the vegetable vendors in this street). The industry does not regard it as a formal market. However, judging from the strong bullish air in all parties at the moment, it will only be a matter of time before Zhongguan soybeans are bought at 20 yuan. Yesterday, the total market included more than 1,000 bags of Dingjiazhou soybeans (the price is detailed in the market price column), two cars of Wuhu soybeans, five cars of Nanjing soybeans, and 300 bags of Qingdao soybeans. Yesterday, 180 bags of soybeans were brought from Beisha.

### Coal: Temperature Charcoal Recovers Slightly, Haimen Charcoal Still Holds Firm

Since the large arrival of new goods of Wenzhou charcoal, people's hearts have been settled, and the market has gradually recovered. The wholesale price of Grade A charcoal of 50 pounds is 11.50 yuan per load, and the price for customers from the shops is 6.50 yuan per basket. However, the source of Haimen Pingmao charcoal is not much, and the price is still firm. The price for goods at the wharf is still around 8 yuan per load. Some Dongpi hoarding households have been selling off their holdings.

### Piece Goods: Cloth Factories Rush to Weave Ordered Goods

The cloth market has slightly declined because yarn prices are falling daily and dyeing factories are slowly advancing. Hoarding households of grey cloth are releasing their holdings. However, domestic and foreign sales are still strong. Factories are rushing to weave ordered goods, and the remaining amount only accounts for a small number. Therefore, the downward trend is slow. Fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth fell by 2.5 角. Bleached and dyed cloth fell by 5 角. Only the selling plates of the two factories, Jardine Matheson and Lun Chang, are relatively stable. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi merchants handled more than 100 pieces of Feng cloth, fine cloth, and coarse cloth. The Fujian merchants handled more than 120 pieces of already-slanting serge. The Yanjin merchants handled more than 100 boxes of blue cloth and other goods. More than 11,000 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, floral cloth, and poplin were handled abroad in Siam and other places. 1,600 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong on the 12th, and 430 pieces were shipped to Yantai.

Dongbu: The market fell in the morning and recovered at noon, with the market situation erratic. In the morning, the spot demand was weak, and the opening price of fine cloth futures from foreign firms suddenly dropped, causing a part of the small hoarders to gradually show panic and reluctantly sell off. The low plate price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth fell to 20.30 yuan. The price of Sijunzi Yuan serge was sold at 6 角 5 分 7 厘 半. Later, Tianjin merchants rose up and handled fine cloth, with a very healthy appetite, purchasing more than 1,000 pieces of various spot and futures brands. The market situation was tight again. The highest price of Longtou recovered to 21.7 角 半, and the closing price was 21.6 角. The price of Longtou fine diagonal was 21.2 角 半, which was only a difference of 5 分 角 per piece compared to the previous day. However, the number of fine cloth opened by foreign firms in the long term was also about 1,000 pieces, and the price was cheap, which has an impact. The made-up prices for Longdian fine cloth in the following month are 22 yuan, Yanghe 21.9 角, and Feiyu in the current month 21.8 角.

### Sugar Market: Pianqing Opens at 43 Yuan

The sugar market did not fluctuate much yesterday. The current price of 24 rough white sugar set by the association was 56.50 yuan for goods in this warehouse, 57.10 yuan for newly arrived goods in the foreign warehouse, 56.40 yuan for old goods, and 45.50 yuan for transit goods. The price of Taikoo Che Bai 嘜 in the Dong warehouse was 58 yuan, and the price in the West warehouse was 58.50 yuan. The rest were all quoted at the original price. The price of Dutch Red MP 嘜 was 45 yuan, and the price of oil bags was 44 yuan. There was no movement in local cotton white and local ice. The national refined sugar market was tighter, but there were not many transactions. The reason is that the firms do not want to buy and store because the price is already high. Yesterday, the Guangdong merchants only opened 85 bags of Shimen Pianqing, and the price was 43 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: Chinese and Foreign Silk Prices Are Both Weak

The Japanese and American silk markets continued to decline. New York recently fell by 7.5 分, and the distant period fell by 1 角 3 分 5. Yokohama spot prices fell by 40 yuan in the morning, and by 60 yuan at the afternoon close. The distant period fell by 65 yuan. The market was closed in the afternoon. The Shanghai silk market was more sluggish. The 78-point average of white factories opened at 9,800 yuan yesterday, which was less than 500 yuan higher than the high price recorded a month ago. Dachang and others imported 20 loads, and Qianjin also traded 40 loads at the same price as the previous market.

### After the Wangdian Train Bombing Incident: Japanese Troops Brutally Abuse Innocent Shanghai-Hangzhou Passengers, Subjected to Strict Inspections, Political Work Team Members Suffered Torture, Half of Shendang Town Has Been Turned to Ashes

According to visitors from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, since the Japanese military freight train was destroyed by a landmine near Wangdian, there are still six bombed vehicles left beside the tracks. The Japanese troops have vented their anger on the passengers. Passengers on the Shanghai-Hangzhou trains are subjected to inspections, which are extremely strict. Passengers in the train must immediately take off their clothes, as well as all their luggage and other items, and open their boxes and untie their knots to be inspected. Men and women are treated the same way. Any delay in action will be beaten immediately. Yesterday, female passengers on two trains were unaware of the situation and were slightly late in opening their packages. The inspectors immediately picked up the huge package and threw it at the top of their heads several times.

All the passengers dared to be angry but dared not speak. Near Yuanhua in Xiashi, there is Fengjiaqiao, where more than ten male and female members of the political work team dispatched by the Commissioner's Office are stationed. It is not known how the Japanese troops detected it. They suddenly surrounded the area, and all the male and female team members were arrested by the Japanese troops, who whipped them indiscriminately. The pure-minded female team members were forcibly humiliated and trampled on. After being trampled on, they and the male team members were

perforated through their palms

and connected with a rope, so that they could walk together. When one person moved, the rope pulled on the connected palms, and all the palms rubbed painfully, and the sound of miserable screams was sour to the nose. They were taken to Jiaxing for execution. Anyone who was suspected by the Japanese troops of being a spy or a plainclothes team member was continuously poured water into their mouths and noses with a bucket, and their stomachs were as swollen as a five-stone gourd, and feces flowed out of their mouths.

suffocating and hoarse

Until they surrendered, the Japanese troops did not stop. It was also heard that some of the Japanese troops stationed in Yuanhua were stationed in Lu's residence. The Lu family was rich and had a lot of silver dollars buried. They were all dug up by the Japanese troops. It was heard that the silver dollars were exchanged on the spot at a price of 2.30 法币 per dollar. The Japanese troops went to Shendang again the day before yesterday and set fire to thousands of houses in the town. Shendang, formerly known as a major town, is now half-destroyed by the fire of robbery.

### Shanghai West Police Authority: Continued Negotiations, Still No Possibility of Approaching

The工部局has repeatedly contacted and negotiated with the "Municipal Government" on the issue of road construction beyond the border in western Shanghai, but there have been no specific results. The工部局is still working hard to continue the negotiations. Although Mr. Filipo, the director and president of the工部局, was suddenly attacked on the 6th of this month, he was lucky enough to escape unharmed. However, Mr. Fei did not take it to heart and still focused on the police authority negotiations for road construction beyond the border. At about 4 p.m. on the 11th, Mr. Fei and Mr. Fankling, the director of the工部局, visited Bo Xiao'an at his residence on Shigaota Road in Hongkou. It was heard that the matter discussed was still the above issue, but it was heard that there was still no possibility of approaching on both sides.

### Japanese Ship Chongming Maru Sinks After Being Bombed, Loss is Quite Heavy, 22 People Missing

Since the Japanese troops occupied the areas along the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River shipping routes have not been opened on the pretext of military relations, and only Japanese ships are allowed to travel back and forth. Foreign ships from the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and Italy have been obstructed. Recently, although the Japanese side announced the opening of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, it has not yet been realized. According to a Daguang News Agency reporter's investigation into the shipping industry, the Japanese "East Asia Shipping Company's" Chongming Maru was operating between Wuhu and Hankou, specializing in passengers and cargo. Because there were no foreign ships competing, the business was extremely developed. The ship departed from Wu on the morning of the 10th to Han. At 11 o'clock, on the river surface about 30 miles away from Hankou, it suddenly touched an explosive, and the bottom of the ship was blown open with a loud noise, and the ship sank accordingly. Afterwards, the Japanese steamship Taomaru rushed to the rescue, but 22 Japanese crew members and passengers were missing. It is believed that they have all drowned. It is heard that the ship was loaded with a lot of rice and military supplies, and the loss was extremely heavy.

### Eighth Installment of Principal and Interest of the Unified Public Bond: Shanghai Market Pays Exchange Transfer Tickets, Four Banks Decide to Discount and Pay, Shanghai Still Pays in Six Installments

In order to unify the names of bonds and exchange and compensate for the old bonds of various types, the National Government issued the Unified Public Bond of the Republic of China in 1936, with five types of bonds A, B, C, D, and E, totaling 146.6 million national currency, using the customs surplus as the fund for repaying the principal and interest. Since the customs revenue in the occupied areas was intercepted, the Ministry of Finance issued a notice on January 15 last year on the method of repaying the principal and interest in the future. However, in order to maintain the credit of domestic debt, the four banks, China, China, Communications, and Farmers, agreed to discount and pay the due principal and interest. The funds for the seventh repayment of principal and payment of interest have been discounted by the four banks and paid from July 31 of last year. However, Shanghai was paid off in six installments and has already been fully paid by the end of last year.

fully paid off

Regarding the eighth installment of principal repayment lottery, it has been carried out by the National Debt Fund Management Committee. The total amount of each bond that has been drawn, as well as the interest due, is 56,476,600 yuan. According to the regulations, the payment date is January 31. According to an investigation by a Xinsheng News Agency reporter yesterday to the Shanghai branches of the four banks and the National Debt Fund Management Committee, although the order to discount and pay has not been received from the headquarters of the four banks regarding the eighth repayment of principal and payment of interest of the Unified Public Bond, it has been decided to

follow the last time

The method of discounting and paying will be used. Shanghai will still be paid off in six installments, and the exchange transfer notes commonly used in the Shanghai market will be paid.

### Felipp Will Leave Shanghai, British Expats Bid Farewell

### British Soldier Kills People, Sentenced to Hanging, But Will Apply for Pardon

The North China Daily News reported that the British Court in China has been hearing the case of British soldier Ike Ford of the Xifu Zijiao Highland Team, who shot and killed Tai Davis, a soldier of the same team, at the intersection of Kaifeng Road and North Tibet Road on the night of November 4 last year, since the 9th of this month. The case was presided over by Prosecutor Sir Mo Su. Yesterday (the 11th) afternoon, the trial continued. The 12 jurors went to the scene of the incident to conduct an on-site investigation for about two hours before returning to the court. At about 7 p.m., Sir Mo Su pronounced the verdict in court based on the jurors' opinion, sentencing Ike Ford to death for murder, but the application for pardon should be submitted through normal channels. According to the records, Ike Ford is the second British person sentenced to hanging in Shanghai. In 1915, an Englishman named MacFarlane murdered his wife and was sentenced to hanging.

### Rumors of Issuing More Banknotes, Facts Prove to be Groundless, Speculators' Rumors Are Everyday, So the Exchange Market Has Never Been Affected

After China's foreign trade improved and turned into a surplus, the foreign exchange fund became more and more consolidated, and the legal exchange rate has never fallen. The Shanghai black market foreign exchange has gradually stabilized, which is welcomed by merchants because the development of legitimate business should be based on a stable exchange market. However, speculators use the special environment of Shanghai to spread rumors and make profits. As a result, rumors in the market are like spring clouds that stretch and release from time to time. There is no day without them. For example, some parties rumored that the Chinese government would issue an additional 800 million yuan of banknotes, and then rumored that a large number of Chinese banknotes were printed in London. Facts have now proved that this is completely unfounded. The Chinese government has a great determination to stabilize the currency system, so the exchange market has not been affected by such rumors. If such a stable situation can be sustained, the general public will recognize the current exchange rate as a new level, and prices will be based on this as a basis for changes. All business plans will also take this as a starting point.

### Norwegian Ship Comes to Shanghai from Tianjin, Suddenly Searched by Customs, Suspected That the Ship is Secretly Hiding Opium or Drugs, Thorough Search Must Be Completed Today

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that the Norwegian ship Randi, weighing 1,800 tons, arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin with sheepskins and paper yesterday (the 11th) afternoon and berthed at the Roosevelt Pier on the Bund of the French Concession. After being inspected by customs officers, two

motorboats

of the "Municipal Police Bureau" suddenly drove to the side of the ship at midnight and sent 15 people on board. Seeing this, a customs officer immediately summoned the customs water police and ordered the "Municipal Police" to retreat. The customs personnel suspected that these people were not the "Municipal Police," so they dispatched 15 inspectors to board the ship this morning for a

thorough search

But as of this afternoon, nothing has been found. Captain Krestenson was not on the ship this morning, but according to a senior crew member of the ship, he had no prior knowledge. He was surprised to see the inspectors searching when he woke up at 8 o'clock in the morning.

quite surprised

He believes that the ship does not carry any prohibited items. However, customs officials strongly suspect that the ship is secretly hiding a large amount of opium or other drugs. According to a customs official, although they hope to complete the search today, they are afraid that it will take at least until tomorrow (the 13th) to complete it.

### Guowei Arts and Crafts Factory Obtains National Goods Certificate, Issued by the Ministry of Economic Affairs

### Medium-Sized Dredgers That Have Been Detained, No Intention of Returning, Difficult to Restore Huangpu River Completion

Among the dredgers of the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau that have been returned by the Japanese side, there are still only a few, such as the giant dredger Jianshe, which is only suitable for dredging outside the Wusong Estuary and is not suitable for Pei River work at all. In addition, the surveying ship Lilian, although it has also been returned, it has been assisting the Jianshe in surveying at the Wusong Estuary, so it is also not suitable for Pei River work.

Suitable Vessels Have Not Been Returned

It is found that the dredgers suitable for working in the Huangpu River are Haima, Haibao, Haili, Haiyi, and Haihu, and the surveying ships Liyong and Lijiang. However, the above-mentioned medium-sized vessels have been occupied by the Japanese side and are being used in the Yangshupu and Gaoqiao areas to facilitate their dredging and have no intention of returning them. Therefore, although the bureau has been forced to reorganize, it is still unable to resume the dredging project.

Staff Members are Anxious

As for all the staff members on the dredging and surveying vessels of the bureau, it is still difficult for them to board the ships to resume work. The situation is very anxious. However, the Japanese chief engineer Fujisawa has already arrived at the bureau. However, in reality, he also has a nominal title and there are no dredgers available for deployment, so he also feels very bored. In addition, the bureau's shipyard in Zhanghuabang has also not been returned by the Japanese side.

### Case of Japanese Soldiers Beating European and American Women, No Reply Yet, US Consulate Makes Verbal Representations Requesting Prompt Handling

After the last negotiation by the US Consulate, the Japanese authorities have not replied for nearly ten days. After the incident, the Japanese side requested a more detailed report. The US Consulate prepared the details after the New Year holiday, and Ms. Donalson signed and submitted it to the Japanese authorities.

### Continued Operation of Price-Controlled Rice Sales, Rice Merchants Specially Make Six-and-a-Half-Catty Dou, Price-Controlled Rice Committee Holds Standing Committee Meeting Today

### Real Estate Transaction Statistics for the Last Nine Years: 1931 Was the Most Prosperous Year, Last Year's Transactions Exceeded 40 Million Yuan

Shanghai real estate is not only closely related to all residents and landlords in the city, but also closely linked to the entire financial market because it has been an important object for collateral and investment in the financial sector in the past. The year 1931 was the most prosperous, with the total number of transactions reaching 183,216,700 yuan in national currency. Later, due to the global economic downturn and the continuous outflow of Chinese capital, land prices plummeted, construction stagnated, vacancies increased, and rents decreased. Shanghai real estate was virtually ignored. Now, because inland capital is concentrated in Shanghai and previously escaped capital has soared, many investors are constantly buying in, and real estate is gradually recovering its prosperity. The following is a record of the Shanghai real estate transaction statistics compiled by the Montosus Real Estate Club:

Annual Statistics

1930: 84,446,100 yuan; 1931: 183,216,700 yuan; 1932: 23,174,900 yuan; 1933: 43,136,200 yuan; 1934: 12,990,150 yuan; 1935: 14,460,400 yuan; 1936: 12,812,000 yuan; 1937: 4,346,940 yuan; 1938: 10,266,666 yuan; 1939: 42,664,632 yuan.

### Three Mail Carriers Dismissed for Failing to Deliver New Year's Mail on New Year's Day

According to Datong News Agency, although the Shanghai Postal Administration was on holiday during the New Year, it continued to maintain the delivery of letters as usual. For example, on New Year's Day, a special shift was scheduled for the delivery of New Year's mail. This year, three mail carriers, using the holiday period as an excuse, failed to comply. Subsequently, the postal authorities summoned the three mail carriers for questioning, but they failed to comply with the summons. As a result, the post office dismissed the three mail carriers, and their uniforms have been returned to the bureau. Rumors that the three mail carriers were given demerits and reinstated are completely untrue.

### Japanese Side Falsely Accuses Chongqing: Concession Authorities State that the Japanese Spokesman's Remarks are Baseless

According to the Continental Daily, a senior official of the Public Concession stated yesterday (the 11th) that the allegation made by the Japanese spokesman at a press conference that the assassination attempt on Mr. Fessenden, Secretary-General and Director-General of the Municipal Council, was carried out by people sent by Chongqing, is unfounded. It is reported that the three assailants have been arrested by the "Shanghai Municipal Police" and handed over to the Japanese Military Police. Therefore, the Japanese spokesman's remarks may be intended to divert public attention from the Japanese authorities' protection of the three assailants.

### Hoping Shop Owners Will Voluntarily Raise Salaries

The Shanghai Production Association, considering that the cost of living on the Isolated Island is becoming increasingly pressing, and that the general workers feel that their income cannot make ends meet, resulting in frequent strikes demanding wage increases, and at a time when the nation's major plans are at stake, labor and management in the rear should strive to produce and jointly understand the principle of national supremacy and ethnic supremacy, and vigorously implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, and must not be indifferent and stir up labor strikes that hinder the administration of the Concession, causing pain to loved ones and joy to enemies. All companies should take into account the suffering of workers and appropriately increase wages. If labor strikes are allowed to drag on, not only will they affect the principle of labor-management production, but also, in this abnormal environment, it is feared that workers will be driven to be exploited, and there is a danger of going astray. The Association has sent letters to major manufacturers, hoping that they will follow the example of the China Book Company in voluntarily raising salaries, which would be a noble deed and beneficial to both the national economy and the people's livelihood, and not only reduce labor strikes and assist the Concession authorities.

### Japanese Ship Carrying White Rice Stopped at Wharf and Forcibly Detained: Negotiations on the Spot Proved Ineffective, Ship Taken to Waterfront Hotel

The Japanese army is very cautious about the rice, cotton, and other grains entering the Concession. All boats sailing within the Peijiang River are inspected by the Nagaue Gendarmerie stationed at the Waterfront Hotel. If there are such goods on board without a purchasing certificate or pass, they will be detained, and there is a danger of the entire cargo being confiscated. In the past, such incidents have been countless. Yesterday afternoon around 5 p.m., a Japanese merchant vessel,

Taoyuan Foreign Company

G.F.H., a barge, loaded with more than 400 jars of shochu, hundreds of pigs, several bundles of firewood, and more than 20 crew members, each purchased more than 20 bags of white rice in Jiangbei. It arrived at the Wusongkou yesterday morning and, after waiting for the inspection to be completed, arrived in Shanghai in the afternoon and docked at Pier 13 on the Bund of Great Road. A Japanese waterfront gendarme and an interpreter came by small boat to inspect the barge and found white rice. They inquired about it, but the crew members hesitated to answer. The Japanese soldier

considered it to be private carrying

and wanted to tow the barge away. Just then, Chinese and Western personnel from the Public Concession Wharf Management Office arrived and negotiated with the Japanese gendarme for a long time to no avail. As a result, at 5:40 p.m., it was still towed to the Waterfront Hotel by a small boat and detained, and it is not known what will happen to it.

### Overseas Chinese Returning to Shanghai from France Describe the Difficult Situation of Overseas Chinese: French Government Increases Income Tax, Actions Must Comply with Wartime Regulations

Since the outbreak of the European War, more than a thousand overseas Chinese have returned to China. The French postal ship Athos arrived in Shanghai from Europe the day before yesterday, carrying another 53 overseas Chinese, including Ye Gezhi, who lived in France and the Netherlands. They were all engaged in industry and commerce in Europe, and it is learned that more than 4,000 overseas Chinese from Guangdong and Fujian and six students studying in France also returned to China on the same ship, disembarking first in Hong Kong and Haiphong.

Levying Wage Tax According to overseas Chinese returning to China, since the outbreak of the European War, at least 2,000 overseas Chinese in France and the Netherlands have been affected by the war and have lost their jobs. In addition to those who have successively returned to China, there are still a large number of overseas Chinese waiting for ships to return to China. At present, overseas Chinese merchants in France and the Netherlands who are engaged in small-scale sales have closed down, and only a portion of overseas Chinese who have opened shops and work in large factories remain. However, due to economic difficulties, wages in various factories have gradually decreased. At present, the wages earned are only one-third of those before the war. The French government has recently increased the wartime income tax by one-fifth for each person, so the wages received are very meager. Most Chinese workers are unable to maintain their livelihoods and have resigned one after another.

Shortening Night Market As for the recent situation of the European War, the preparations for war in various countries have become more active. The French government has strict control over foreigners. When walking on the streets during the day, they must comply with the wartime regulations of the French government and carry gas masks. Otherwise, they are prohibited from walking. Foreigners without special passes are not allowed to pass at night, otherwise they will be detained. Therefore, the night business hours of overseas Chinese shops have automatically gradually shortened.

### New Drugs Not Registered Are Not Allowed to Be Sold: Those with Such Inventory Must Report to the Association Within a Limited Time

The Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association issued a notice yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, due to the recent proliferation of new drugs on the market, some of the raw materials used do not conform to the ingredients stipulated in the pharmacopoeia, which not only hinders legitimate business but also damages the credibility of new drugs. Therefore, on December 13 of last year, a joint meeting of the executive supervisors and consultants of the two associations was convened to discuss methods of banning. It was unanimously agreed that the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association had already established rules for product registration and review. Whether members or non-members, if they wish to sell their new products, they should first register with the association and, after passing the review, the association will notify the members before they can be sold. It was resolved to notify the members that new products not registered with the New Pharmaceutical Association will not be allowed to be sold in the future. If there is such inventory, and it is not clear whether it has been registered with the association, please list the names and inquire with the association within fifteen days of receiving this letter so that we can reply. Otherwise, if it is found out later, it will be dealt with in accordance with the rules. It is appropriate to record the case and inform you, and it is hoped that you will comply with this resolution."

### Arsenolite and Realgar Prohibited from Export

The Ministry of Economic Affairs telegraphed the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that the main component of arsenolite is arsenic trioxide, which contains a lot of arsenic and can be used as an important raw material for manufacturing sneeze-inducing toxic gases such as Lewisite, so it should be prohibited from export. In addition to telegraphed Resources Commission to stop issuing export permits for arsenolite and realgar, it is specially telegraphed for information.

### Overview of Important Administrative Matters of the Shanghai Municipal Council in 1939

During the year, the process of urban recovery progressed very slowly and was constrained by various difficulties. However, the great capacity of all sectors of society to overcome all kinds of hardships was able to manifest itself again. Commercial conditions have been chaotic since the Sino-Japanese War. Last year, the outbreak of the European War and the depreciation of the national currency made the situation even more unstable. Several new problems arose in the city last year, the most prominent of which were (1) the handling of a large number of Jewish refugees from Central Europe, (2) the negotiations on police powers in the area of roads outside the western boundary of Shanghai in the second half of the year, and (3) the extremely serious situation when the national currency fell to three and a half pennies.

Negotiations for the Return of the Area North of the Suzhou Creek

Negotiations for the return of the area north of the Suzhou Creek to the full management of the Council have not been successful. However, with the cooperation of the Japanese authorities, the Council has expanded its power to issue various licenses in the area. Chinese people who want to go to the Hongkou and Yangshupu districts must hold passes. These passes are still checked by Japanese sentries stationed there, but the restrictions on the transportation of goods have been relaxed.

More Than 30,000 Refugees in the Concession

In addition to carrying out normal affairs, the departments of the Council in the areas south of the Suzhou Creek had to handle a number of heavy tasks. At the end of the year, there were 28 refugee shelters for Chinese refugees in the Concession, accommodating about 33,000 refugees. The Council managed and cared for these shelters and tried to continue to merge them to make the management more strict. In the area outside the western boundary of Shanghai, which was originally a residential area, factories and houses have been built in recent years. However,

Negotiations on the Issue of Road Construction Beyond the Boundary

At the end of last year, Chinese police suddenly dispatched by the Shanghai Special Municipal Government were stationed at several of the most important roads and intersections in the area outside the western boundary of Shanghai and directed traffic, which caused a serious situation. All of these roads were built by the Council, and the police powers have always been exercised by the Police Department of the Council. The Council has borne a huge amount of expenditure for the development of the western corner of Shanghai. After the above-mentioned incident occurred, the Council immediately protested. At that time, several serious incidents occurred, and police officers on both sides died. The Council has begun negotiations with Mayor Chuan Xiao'an and exchanged views on the case in mid-November. By the end of the year, no solution had been reached, and the dangerous situation of police officers from both sides standing guard and exercising police powers in the area has not changed.

Limiting Rice Prices and Cracking Down on Hoarding

The Council has paid close attention to the supply of food and fuel in the Concession, allowing rice and coal to be prioritized. In the summer of last year, when rice prices were rising, the authorities of the two concessions jointly issued a notice restricting rice prices. In August, the price of white rice once rose to 50 yuan per stone, far exceeding the price limit. Some rice shops stopped business because they could not import goods, and it was not uncommon to sell adulterated rice. Later, due to good harvests in rice-producing areas, rice prices gradually fell, but in December, they rose again. Therefore, the authorities of the two concessions jointly issued a notice again, giving a serious warning to general hoarders and speculators.

Electricity and Gas Prices Increased Separately

Regarding coal, there was a shortage of inventory in the Far East, and it was necessary to order it from abroad, so coal prices rose sharply. The Council's Fuel Committee paid close attention to this at all times. As coal prices rose, the most difficult companies were the Shanghai Electric Power Company and the Shanghai Gas Company. Therefore, they successively obtained the approval of the Council to levy surcharges separately to make up for the huge operating expenses.

Handling Jewish Refugees

Near the end of the year before last, a large number of Jewish refugees began to come to Shanghai from Central Europe. By last year, the number of people had increased sharply, and the situation began to become serious. Most of the refugees were placed in shelters in the area north of the Suzhou Creek. This placement work was the responsibility of several committees and groups, and the Council also provided assistance, lending some of its properties in the eastern district for accommodation. Later, as refugees continued to arrive, the situation became more and more serious. The Council then requested the consular corps to telegraph their respective governments, stating the plight of the city and the inability of refugees to find jobs, asking them to find ways to prevent them from coming to Shanghai. However, it was ineffective. By April, the total number of refugees exceeded 6,000. In May, scarlet fever was discovered in the shelters. Fortunately, it was handled properly and did not spread. In June, the total number of refugees reached about 10,000. In August, it increased to about 15,000. Therefore, the Japanese authorities announced a temporary ban on refugees coming to Shanghai. At the same time, the Council also decided to prohibit European refugees from continuing to enter the country and sent separate letters to the consular corps and various shipping companies for verification. In October, the Council and the Japanese authorities agreed to promulgate a rule allowing these refugees to live in the area south of the Suzhou Creek after arriving in Shanghai. As of the end of the year, about 300 permits had been issued under this rule.

Striving to Prevent Water Accumulation on Roads

Last year, many parts of the area south of the Suzhou Creek were often flooded, causing inconvenience. The Council published a statement in November explaining the cause of the flooding. It was found that water accumulation on the roads was due to high tides and excessive rainfall. To prevent high tides, the Works Department of the Council installed valves at the mouths of the drains in the flooded area to prevent backflow of river water. A seawall was built along the Bund, and a pump was installed to drain the drain water when the drain openings were blocked. These measures have been effective. Last year's excessive rainfall caused the flooded area to expand and last longer. The reasons were (1) the Huangpu River and the Suzhou Creek have not been dredged for a long time since August 1937, (2) the city's ground is sinking year by year, (3) industry in the western district outside the boundary of Shanghai has suddenly developed and is not controlled by the Council, and (4) the drain outlets of the French Concession at the junction of Avenue Foch and the Public Concession are not easy to maintain perfectly. The Director of the Works Department of the Council reported to the Board of Directors that if the flooding situation is to be completely improved, it is estimated that about 800,000 yuan in national currency will be required. At that time, the Council did not undertake the project because of insufficient financial resources, but decided to take various reasonable measures as much as possible in 1940. If there is not too much rain this year, the above-mentioned situation can be greatly improved. (To be continued)

### Yong'an Company Employee Arrested and Released After Reprimand Yesterday

The entire staff of the Yong'an Company on Nanjing Road had demanded improved treatment and increased salaries from the company authorities due to the high cost of goods, which had once led to a strike. The matter was resolved through negotiations between labor and management. However, on December 31 of last year, the company authorities suddenly issued an order to dismiss 31 employees, which caused dissatisfaction among all employees. The situation was very serious for a time. The Laozha Police Station received a report and sent several Chinese and Western detectives to suppress the situation and arrested three employees: Liang Tongxin and Cai Titao from Ningbo, and Wu Renjie from Wuxi. They were escorted to the First Special Court and requested to be detained. Yesterday morning, Liang and others were escorted by the police station to the First Special Court's Criminal Division One. Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the Chinese Police Station formally filed a public prosecution in accordance with Articles 150 and 153, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, and recounted the situation at the time. The defendants also hired lawyers to appear in court on their behalf, requesting the judge to clearly investigate the interrogation and issue a verdict in court. The judge sentenced Liang, Cai, and Wu to a fine of ten yuan each. If they were unable to pay the fine, they were allowed to offset it at the rate of two yuan per day. However, it was found that Liang and others had been detained on the first day of this month, and according to the detention date, they had already exceeded the amount of the fine, so they were released in court.

### Fire in Shacks on Singapore Road: More Than 500 Burned Down

Hundreds of shacks of ordinary people on Singapore Road and Jiaozhou Road in western Shanghai suddenly caught fire yesterday afternoon around 5 p.m. The flames were soaring, and the fire was extremely fierce. Residents fled in all directions upon hearing the alarm. Later, the fire brigade drove to the scene and tried their best to extinguish the fire. It took about three hours for the fire to be extinguished. It is estimated that more than 500 shacks were burned down. Whether anyone was buried in the fire is currently being investigated by the fire brigade in the rubble.

### Another Suspect Arrested in Coal Fraud Case: Awaiting Joint Trial

Lu Yili, a peddler from Changzhou at No. 33 Sichuan Road, Huacheng Coal Company, falsely claimed to the manager, Wu Tieqi from Guangdong, on March 4 of last year that the Da Zhonghua Shoe Factory needed 500 tons of Hongji coal dust. Since the company had no goods to sell, it was learned that the Yuancheng Coal Company at No. 106 Gansidong Road had goods on the market. It could purchase 200 tons from them and resell them to Da Zhonghua to obtain a huge profit. Wu believed him and prepared 6,680 yuan the next day. He sent Lu and his assistants, Weng Shaoyou and Zheng Changgen, to the Yuancheng Coal Company with the money. After paying, they presented a forged stock receipt of the Tongchang Coal Company as an excuse. When the case was discovered, Lu absconded with the money. Wu reported the case to the French Police Station, and Chen Kangyuan (from Ningbo), a peddler from the Yuancheng Coal Company, was first arrested and sent to the court, which sentenced him to six months in prison. Lu was wanted by the court in the summer. After nine months, Lu Yili was arrested on the day before yesterday and escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. The case was recorded in yesterday's newspaper after interrogation and detention for investigation and then interrogation. It is now learned that during the investigation, Lu's brother, Lu Shouxiang, used 3,000 yuan of the money defrauded by Lu, Chen Kangyuan used 1,000 yuan, and the remainder was spent by Lu himself. Therefore, Chen Kangyuan (who was previously sentenced to six months' probation) was arrested by the detectives, but he had already escaped. Only Lu Shouxiang was arrested and escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court yesterday, requesting detention and joint investigation with Lu Yili, and then requesting interrogation after the investigation. After questioning by Judge Zhu Chuzhe, the defendant was ordered to be detained and await a joint trial with Lu Yili on the 18th.

### Robbers Xu Chenggui and Others Kill During Road Robbery

Huish Police Station Chinese Detective Shang Wu, Huang Fusen, Chinese Sergeant Wang Youshan, and Liang Yuliang arrested 14 robbers including Zhou Changlin, Xu Chenggui, Zhang Tianhua, and the woman Xu Chenshi at No. 263 Aierjin Road and No. 400 Ningbo Road on December 29 of last year, and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi appeared in court for a continued trial. Lawyer Qian Xunjiu of the Police Station stated that during the adjournment, it was investigated that the defendants Xu Chenggui and Zhang Tianhua, together with Ge Jinbiao, who was at large, used weapons to rob Zhai Asan, who was leaving the Qianhe Paint Shop at No. 138 Tonglu, No. 444 Jiangxi Road, at 11:10 a.m. on November 8 of last year. Zhai Asan was going to take 1,000 yuan from the post office on North Suzhou Road back to the shop. While passing through the lane, Zhang Tianhua shot and injured Zhai's head, killing him on the spot. The robbers escaped with the money and each received 300 yuan. The pistol belonged to Xu Chenggui, who received 100 yuan more. The suspects Zhou Xirong, Zhang Zhongliang, and He Binghai were found to be unrelated and were requested to be released in advance. The court approved it. The remaining nine people, including Zhou Changlin and Xu Chenshi, were adjourned for further investigation of other cases. Judge Jiang interrogated Xu and Zhang separately and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further verification.

### Appeal in Rape of Dancer Case Concluded Yesterday

Cao Zheng, the son of Cao Yongxiang, the owner of the Cao Xiangtai Foreign Goods Store at No. 276 Avenue Edward VII, had a close relationship with Qian Xiuying (17 years old), a dancer at the Da Mei Dance Hall, last summer. They went to the World Hotel on Avenue Edward VII and secretly made a lifelong commitment. After several romantic encounters, Xiuying became pregnant. However, Cao Zheng's family opposed his marriage to a dancer, which thwarted their marriage plans. Subsequently, Qian Shaoqing, Qian's father, filed a complaint with the Second Special Court on behalf of Xiuying, accusing Cao Zheng of hindering the family, etc. Cao Zheng also admitted the charges. Judge Zhang sentenced Cao Zheng to one year and six months in prison for hindering the family. Cao refused to accept the sentence and hired a lawyer to appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Chen Daqi, accompanied by Judges Wang and Wu, opened the Third Criminal Division for trial. In order to shirk responsibility, Cao Zheng completely overturned his original confession and denied that he intended to marry Qian Xiuying as his wife, only admitting that he had had several physical relations with Qian. After verifying the confessions in court and questioning Qian Xiuying in detail, he ordered the debate in the case to be concluded and set the sentencing for the 19th.

### Foreman Suspected of Stealing Gold Bars Arrested

Liu Xiaoyi, a 25-year-old man from Yangzhou, is currently a foreman.

He was taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Lawyer Zhang Shi of the Police Station stated the case and requested permission for detention because the police station had not yet completed the investigation in this case in order to continue the investigation. The court briefly questioned Liu and ordered him to be detained for further investigation.

### Infant Suffocates to Death While Sleeping with Maid: Maid Wang Zhushi Detained Pending Investigation

Wang Zhushi (26 years old), a woman from Suzhou, came to Shanghai from her hometown in October of last year and worked as a maid in the home of Peng Wu'huang, a man from Jiangxi, at No. 51, Lane 375, Xiaoshadu Road. She did housework such as cooking and laundry during the day, and slept with Peng's 18-month-old daughter, Meimei, at night. Around 1 a.m. on the 11th, Wang Zhushi accidentally

pressed her mouth and nose

suffocating her to death. She only realized it at dawn when Meimei was already dead, with blood flowing from her mouth and nose. In a panic, she wiped away the blood with a towel and reported to Peng's wife, Tu, that Meimei was ill and dying. Peng Wu'huang and his wife rushed to see their daughter and found blood stains on the bed, quilt, and mattress. They interrogated Wang, but she was evasive. They sent the girl to the Red Cross Hospital, but she died without being resuscitated. After the doctor determined that Meimei had

died of suffocation,

the body was sent to the mortuary. At the same time, the Gordon Road Police Station was notified, and detectives were sent to the address to take the maid Wang Zhushi to the police station.

Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered her to be remanded in custody pending further examination of Meimei's body.

### New Official Abandons Wife; Former Wife Sues for Alimony

 Luo Canhua, a woman from Zhenjiang, is 31 years old. Years ago, she was married to Zhang Zhengzhi, a fellow villager, by arrangement of her parents. They have been married for seven years and have a daughter who is now four years old. They used to live together in Suzhou, but fled to Shanghai due to the war two years ago. Zhang was working in education, so their circumstances were generally average, but their marital love was constant. Unexpectedly, Zhang recently became an important official in a puppet organization through sycophancy. Money became very easy to come by, and his personal life suddenly changed. He indulged in prostitution almost every night. Soon, he met a woman in the pleasure quarter and treated her like a precious jewel. He engaged in cohabitation, neglecting his wife of many years and cutting off her financial support. For the past six months, Luo has been living entirely on loans. Recently, she felt unable to continue and filed a lawsuit against her husband in the First Special Court, requesting alimony. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu summoned them for questioning, but because the defendant's address listed in the plaintiff's complaint was incorrect, the summons could not be delivered. After Luo corrected the address in court yesterday, the court ordered another summons to be issued.

### Village Girl Escapes Prostitution Den

 Tan Suzhen, also known as Jin Di, a sixteen-year-old girl from Suzhou, was lured to Shanghai last September by her aunt, Shen Qian, on the pretext of introducing her to a job as a maid. She was sold to Di Chunsheng, a Changzhou native who ran a brothel at No. 2, Old Guild Hall Lane, Sanma Road, for a price. After entering the brothel, Di forced her to solicit customers at amusement parks. If she disobeyed, she would be beaten and closely monitored. It was not until the day before yesterday that she managed to escape and went to her brother, Tan Shuiquan, who accompanied her to the Zhabei Police Station to request assistance.

### Rickshaw Pullers to Renew Licenses and Register on Schedule From the 22nd of This Month to the 4th of April

 The Municipal Council has scheduled the renewal of licenses and general registration for public rickshaw pullers from the 22nd of this month to the 4th of April. Starting yesterday, the Rickshaw Guild was specially commissioned to distribute registration application forms (four forms per rickshaw, totaling 38,000 forms for 9,500 rickshaws). Rickshaw owners or leaseholders are responsible for introducing rickshaw pullers to register at the Rickshaw Pullers Licensing Office during the specified period. If the number of rickshaw pullers is still less than 38,000 by April 4th, new rickshaw pullers will be openly recruited. At the same time, rickshaw owners are strictly prohibited from exploiting rickshaw pullers and should introduce as many rickshaw pullers as possible who can pull at least 15 shifts per month.

 At the intersection of Avenue du Président Doumer and Rue du Consulat at around 6:55 PM yesterday, a car with a black license plate No. 3639 issued by the concession was suddenly stopped by two gunmen who jumped out from the roadside as it passed by. They opened the car door, jumped in, and ordered the driver to drive towards Avenue Foch. The driver had no choice but to drive east on Avenue Foch. Near the intersection of Hart Road, the two men ordered the car to stop, jumped out together, and headed towards Hart Road. The car was then free to go. Fearing involvement, the driver reported the incident to the police for record.

### The Forger of the Invitation is Kennett Wilson

 The "Millard's Review" reported that the person who issued invitations to local newspapers such as the "North China Daily News" and the "China Press" in the name of the "Reformed Government" Commissioner for the Recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement, Hong Kong, Kowloon, etc., inviting them to attend a banquet at the Repulse Bay Hotel in Hong Kong for the "Sino-British Signing of the Treaty for the Recovery of Hong Kong," was Kennett Wilson, who was once a British lawyer in Shanghai. He later changed his profession to journalism and is now the editor of a publication called "Voice of New China."

### Trolleybuses to be Fitted with Rubber Tires; Seven Still Difficult to Convert; Allowed to Continue Use Until Year-End

 In 1935, the Municipal Council agreed with the Shanghai Electric Construction Company that, starting from January 1, 1936, all trolleybuses owned by the company would receive a reduction in mileage fees paid to the Council once they were fitted with rubber tires. However, the company was required to complete the conversion of all iron-wheeled trolleybuses by January 1, 1939, at the latest. Due to the impact of the Sino-Japanese War, the company's factories were shut down, making it impossible to complete the conversion on time. In 1938, the Council granted an extension until January 1 of this year. However, the company was still required to convert the remaining 25 iron-wheeled trolleybuses as soon as possible before the end of 1938. According to the company, all trolleybuses except for seven that were difficult to convert had been converted within the time limit. The Municipal Council Board of Directors and the Public Utilities Committee, in response to the company's request, allowed the vehicles that had not been fitted with rubber tires to continue to be used until December 31 of this year, at which time the matter would be reviewed again.

### Counterfeit "Yuan Made" Chicken Brand Medicine Seized by Police

 The "Yuan Made" Chicken Brand "Gout and Bone Pain Relief" medicine issued by Jihua Pharmacy at No. 47 Yunnan Road in Shanghai has been approved and registered by the Trademark Bureau.

### City Federation Appeals to Landlords Not to Increase Rent; Times of High Prices and Difficult Livelihoods; If Rent is Increased Again, It Will Affect Public Security and Order

 The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation believes that prices in Shanghai are expensive after the war and people's livelihood is difficult. On September 12 last year, it jointly sent a letter with various public organizations to the courts, asking them to pay special attention to landlords increasing rents on various pretexts in order to relieve the people's hardship. Recently, the Federation has received repeated reports of rent increases in Hongrui Lane, Xinza Road, and Hongfu Lane, North Henan Road. They believe that in this extraordinary period, prices are expensive and people are struggling to survive. If rents are increased again, it will greatly affect the market and public security and order. Poor citizens will find it even more difficult to survive. They especially appeal to landlords to be considerate of the difficult times and not to exploit their tenants like boiling beans in a pod. Stop increasing rents for tenants.

### Letter to the Editor

 Sir, According to the statement made by the involved party, Li Xu Jiaodi, after reading the news item "Young Woman Suddenly Changes Her Mind and Leaves Her Husband" in the Shanghai Shenbao on the 12th of this month, she was extremely surprised. Upon investigation, she and Li Rende have been married for a long time, and have two sons and one daughter. In the beginning, they were still at peace, but later, her husband had an affair and suddenly treated her coldly, gradually resorting to beatings. He even openly took his mistress to room 117 of the Tianjin Ning Business Hotel for a secret rendezvous, where she caught them red-handed. On November 11 of the same year, he beat her with a stick for no reason, causing her to suffer injuries all over her body. Her father-in-law and aunt-in-law also aided and abetted him, which is heartbreaking to speak of. She reported the matter to the French Police and filed a public lawsuit, in which the main text of the judgment stated, "Li Rende is sentenced to 20 days of detention for causing bodily harm, with a two-year suspended sentence" (Case No. 3200, Jie Yi in the 28th year). She has suffered countless abuses and beatings, making it impossible to continue living together. Therefore, on November 13 of last year, she took her children and left in distress, temporarily staying at her mother's house. On the 15th of the same month, she entrusted a lawyer to send a letter to her husband, stating her unavoidable circumstances. Now, the Shenbao's headline for this case is "Young Woman Suddenly Changes Her Mind and Leaves Her Husband," and it is stated that "Jiaodi often leaves and wanders around, and Li has repeatedly tried to persuade her, but she not only refuses to listen, but becomes angry out of shame." These statements are not only far from the truth, but also damage her reputation. As for entrusting lawyer Zhou Liangfu to send a letter requesting 5,400 yuan in alimony, she does not know where this letter came from. In addition to entrusting lawyer Zhou to investigate thoroughly, please send a letter to the Shenbao to make a correction in order to set the record straight. I hereby send this letter on behalf of her, hoping that you will grant a correction. Yours sincerely, Zhou Liangfu, Lawyer, January 12.

### A Journey of the Mind

 — Huang Jiayin

 While talking with a young friend about the joy of traveling and the importance of seeing the world, this friend told me a shocking fact. He said that many of his friends who grew up in Shanghai had never been on a ship, never taken a train, and never left Shanghai in their twenty-odd years of life.

 It seems a bit absurd and unbelievable, but I believe him. I know it's true because in most Chinese families, going out for no reason is an exception, and a rare one at that.

 Living in a civilized society with such convenient transportation, we have a vast world to explore, which can expand our knowledge of life. Yet, we prefer to be like frogs in a well, living in a small corner.

 I sigh.

 I not only sigh at the narrow scope of Chinese people's lives, and their lack of understanding of the importance of travel, but I also sigh at their failure to take advantage of the opportunities for intellectual journeys.

 What are you talking about? What is a journey of the mind?

 There are plenty of books in bookstores and newspapers and magazines on newsstands. Books, newspapers, and magazines are the tools for our intellectual journeys, the spiritual trains, ships, and planes. Books are not just filled with gold houses or beautiful women; they are filled with ideas, science, life, society, the principles of living, knowledge about the world, and the vast, boundless world.

 Reading a book is like taking a long intellectual trip; reading a newspaper or a magazine allows you to travel to far-off corners of the world in just a few minutes.

 We must not only understand the meaning of travel but also understand the importance of intellectual journeys.

 Travelers in this world, let us be generous and spend some time every day on intellectual journeys!

 Essays

### The Responsibility of Doing

 — Ouyang Wen

 We are born into this world for love, for some illusory and ethereal love. We love birds, flowers, mountains, water, the earth, and everything else. In fact, we are loved by them as well.

 For more than a decade, we have been seeking happiness in love and enduring pain in love. This happiness makes us forget all the sorrows of the past, and this pain encourages us to move forward. No difficulty can stop our ambition. No matter how much social pressure or environmental coercion there is, we only know to move forward, to move forward, straight to the bright lighthouse.

 During this time, we have met many friends and seen many faces clearly. This one is cannibalistic, that one is deceitful, this one is hypocritical, and that one is seductive. However, we have not been eaten, nor have we been deceived. Similarly, hypocrisy can only deceive itself, and seduction can only mislead itself. We will not be fooled.

 Today, as we recall the joy of more than a decade ago and the struggles in between, we cannot help but shed tears. The houses we saw when we were young are now old, the roads we were familiar with when we were young have now changed, and the friends and classmates we knew when we were young are now parents. The wheel of time is moving so fast!

 We have many friends, which is the greatest meaning and comfort of our existence in this world. Some friends help us with our lives, some friends point us to the future, and even more friends are willing to sacrifice themselves to solve our difficulties and bring us happiness. We don't know how to thank them enough. We know that this is the love of mankind, the most divine and sacred love in the world, and we can only repay them with this love.

 We remember responsibility, the responsibility of being human. What is the responsibility of being human? It is to dedicate one's love, to express one's strength, and to give everything to society. We do beneficial work in society, and we should not care about some costs or rewards. We must know that work that is bound by costs and rewards is not real work, but a deceptive facade. We are not deceivers, we are still two young children with pure thoughts.

### Gandhi and Nehru

 — Wen He

 Gandhi and Nehru are two revolutionary leaders of India. Gandhi has long been known worldwide, and Nehru visited our country only last year, so everyone is also familiar with him. These two have different views on life and different temperaments, yet they have a strong spiritual connection. It is rare in the world for two leaders to cooperate so well.

 It is interesting to talk about the contrast between their two personalities. Gandhi is a devout religious man, while Nehru does not believe in ghosts or gods. He advocates the separation of politics and religion. Gandhi's ideal India is a simple rural society. Nehru, on the other hand, has been influenced by new ideas and wants to transform India into an industrialized urban society. Gandhi firmly believes in non-violent resistance, while Nehru thinks this is just a temporary measure. Gandhi opposes any drastic reforms in society and economy. He believes that the most important thing is for everyone to cleanse their hearts and seek spiritual purity, and society can be improved through the cooperation of all classes. But Nehru doubts these things. He says that if the material environment does not change, how easy is it to transform one's conscience? From this point of view, Gandhi's ideal seems more abstract, while Nehru is much clearer about his plans.

 However, Gandhi is by no means a reactionary. He is the most special revolutionary of all time. His methods are too strange. Not to mention Westerners don't understand him, even his old comrades think he is a "mystery." He has a unique spiritual power, and the souls of 300 million Indians seem to be influenced by him at all times. In addition, his courage, his austere life, and his indomitable spirit are rare in the world. Therefore, despite Nehru's ideological differences with Gandhi, in fact, Nehru simply worships Gandhi.

 Nehru never directly calls him "Gandhi." He always calls him "Grandpa" (Bapu) or "Gandhi Grandpa" (Gandhiji). Whenever he has any doubts, he always consults Gandhi. He strongly praises Gandhi's opinions and considers his own ideas to be less important. Sometimes, the progressive youth of India criticize Gandhi for being too backward. Gandhi himself does not defend himself, but Nehru will loudly refute their misconceptions. The Indian poet Tagore once said, "Except for Gandhi, no one else feels that the Indians are his own flesh and blood." Nehru agrees with this statement very much.

 Gandhi and Nehru both came from wealthy families, but later they were both willing to give up their comfortable lives and dedicate themselves to the oppressed people. They both sacrificed everything to engage in the Indian national liberation movement. Their goals are the same, their missions are the same, and in addition, they have a teacher-student relationship, so how can they not cooperate? Gandhi put it best: "Nehru and I both feel that neither of us can do without the other. There is a spiritual connection between us that no intellectual difference can destroy."

 We have faith, and this faith makes us stand firm in the world and never fall. We are like a ship sailing in fierce waves. One big wave hits us, we are not afraid. Two big waves hit us, we are not afraid. Three big waves hit us, we are even less afraid! Why? Because we have goals, we have faith. Our spirit is brave, our will is firm. If we fail, we must work hard. If we succeed, we must work even harder. We know very well that this is not being cattle or horses, but serving the public and seeking happiness. We are about to reach the shore, let our friends join hands.

 Random Thoughts

### Playing Deaf and Dumb

 — Hong Fei

 After the outbreak of the Second European War, one day, King George of England stopped to watch the workers polishing the inside of shells while inspecting an arms factory. The sound of friction when polishing the shells was very loud, which can be described as deafening. Therefore, ordinary workers could not undertake this work, and the factory hired deaf and mute workers. King George leaned his head in to watch those "robot-like figures" working through a small glass window.

 According to the New York Times, whether they are geniuses or disabled, they can all do their best in the cause of war now. Using deaf and dumb workers to polish shells is like using canaries in cages to test for poisonous gases. However, in democratic countries, we have the right to say this: Only in times of war emergency do we recruit deaf and dumb people to take on the duties of robots. But in the culture of modern totalitarianism, human life is completely immersed in a robotic state. Whether in times of peace or war, the oppressed people are practically deaf and dumb. They can only hear what their masters want them to hear, and they are only allowed to say what their masters tell them to say.

 It is perhaps the distinction between totalitarian and democratic countries that the people of totalitarian countries have to live their lives blindly by playing deaf and dumb.

### Talking in Patches

 — Shi Ding

 A report said that "Goering wants to make Germany a factory, barracks, and kitchen." We only hope that this cook does not take bullets for sausages and give them to the people.

 Finnish pilots have repeatedly flown over Soviet Leningrad to drop abridged Bibles. The way of fighting is becoming more and more amazing.

 US President Roosevelt called isolationists ostriches, seemingly wanting to forcibly pull out their heads buried in the sand of narrow patriotism.

 The British most popular humor magazine, Punch, speaks wittily and meaningfully. Once, a writer asked, "Why can't the countries of Europe live together like a big family?" Punch's answer is: Europe is bad because it is just like most big families.

 There are Finns in Shanghai who are raising funds to aid Finland, and after donating, they call the people of Shanghai "the real League of Nations." I don't know if it's praise or scolding.

 An Italian newspaper called this European war "a social struggle," "a duel between the 'have-nots' and the 'haves.'"

### Franco's Film Policy

 — Hua Zhi

 The Spanish dictator Franco has recently attempted to eliminate the influence of foreign films in his country, and has adopted a clever approach.

 He does not follow other countries' methods of prohibiting the import of films, but stipulates that for every ten films that a foreign film company wants to show in Spain, one film must be shot in Spain. At first glance, it does not seem like anything new, but American filmmakers are greatly alarmed and are demanding that the government intervene.

 It turns out that Franco's film policy includes two secrets: "promoting culture" and "obtaining foreign exchange." Since foreign films are shot within Spain, all backgrounds and consciousness will naturally be based on being pro-Spanish. When these films are transported to Central America, many Spanish-speaking people living there will undoubtedly watch the Spain under Franco's rule, and make a mandatory publicity for him. This is the main point.

 In addition, when each film is made and released in Spain, the Spanish government and foreign filmmakers will split the profits equally. If the film is transported outside of Spain, a deposit must first be paid to the Spanish authorities before it is allowed to leave. At the same time, the money earned from screenings abroad must be converted into foreign exchange and split with the Spanish government.

 In this way, only the Spanish government benefits. Many expenses of foreign filmmakers will take a very long time to recoup, and sometimes they suffer heavy losses, which is equivalent to making all the revenue from one of every ten films shown in Spain as a donation to Franco. Of course, foreign filmmakers are free to withdraw from the Spanish market, but in this way, Franco's purpose of excluding foreign films will be fully achieved.

### Xin Yanqiu Arrives Safe and Sound, Yu Zhenfei's Charm Remains

— Biyu

Xin Yanqiu, originally named Wang Yuhua, is a famous female performer who rose to prominence after Ji Zhang'eyun. Her art is entirely based on that of Cheng Yushuang, and she has gained a great deal of understanding. She is one of the most like-minded learners of Cheng in the female troupe, and her appearance and acting are also very similar to Yushuang. Xin's learning of Cheng must have taken considerable effort. Several years ago, she followed Yang Xiaolou and Ma Lianliang to the south, and was greatly appreciated by the people of Jiangnan. Three years ago, when a certain celebrity celebrated his sixtieth birthday, Xin came from afar to offer congratulations and performed plays such as "Wuhua Cave" and "Visiting Mother". Her skills had indeed improved a lot compared to her previous visits to the south. In the same year, she performed in Baixia, and Cheng Yushuang also performed in the capital, so Xin competed directly with Cheng, which enhanced their common reputation. After returning to the north, her reputation increased day by day, and she had the potential to dominate the female performers in Beijing. Last year, Xin was imprisoned in Beijing for a certain incident, and it was rumored in Shanghai that Xin Lingyu had died in prison. It was later confirmed that this statement was incorrect, and Xin had sold her former residence in the capital and moved her family to Tianjin, intending to live there permanently and no longer perform on stage. Therefore, although Xin is in the north, she has not performed for a long time. This time, Shi Xin invited Du Juchu to perform, and Xin agreed to come south after repeated consultations, because she could not refuse out of friendship. The reporter once met Xin during her trip, and her behavior and conversation were as usual. Fortunately, Xin Yanqiu arrived safely, and the people of Shanghai are fortunate to hear Xin's song again in this year of war and chaos.

The young male actor who came with Xin is Yu Zhenfei, an old partner of Cheng Yushuang. Zhenfei was born in Jiangnan and was originally a famous amateur performer in the south. He was persuaded to become a professional actor by Yushuang. Zhenfei once joined the school of veteran actor Cheng Jixian, and was Cheng's proud disciple along with Ye Sheng. Since parting ways with Yushuang, he has not performed for a long time. This time, he came with Xin Yanqiu. Since Xin's acting style is based on Cheng's, Zhenfei's performance will be easy and appropriate, and it is expected to have the effect of green leaves setting off the peony. Zhenfei has been living at home in Beijing in recent years, and has spared no effort in studying Kunqu Opera. Hongdou Guanzhu, a famous Kunqu Opera artist in Beijing, has praised him greatly. Kunqu Opera in Shanghai has now become a situation of high art and few followers, but there are still many people who are proficient in this art. This time Zhenfei came to the south, which is good news for those who appreciate Kunqu Opera.

News from the opera circle: The "China Drama Research Association," a joint organization of small theater groups, recently published the "Drama Series." The first collection, "Wen Tianxiang," was created by the famous director Kong Linxua, and has recently been published. The content depicts the national hero "Wen Tianxiang," whose loyalty and righteousness are magnificent, and is considered to be a profound "regret of the late Ming Dynasty." It is said that the play was first performed by the "Fudan Drama Troupe" and was well received. The second collection, "Xiao Wuyi," was collectively created by members of the association's drama group and will be published soon.

### Anecdotes from Outside the Pear Garden

— Xu Mu Huo

Handsome man Li Xiangyun and Zang Languang

After Huifang and Kunsheng broke away from the joint theater group due to disagreements, they once cooperated with Xiangyun, formed their own troupe, and performed in Tianjin and Beijing several times. They hoped that someone from Shanghai could take over, so they could issue black tickets (black tickets mean that they hoped that someone from Shanghai could take over, so they could issue black tickets (black tickets mean that famous amateur performers secretly receive a bonus) and officially become actors.

However, because he was unwilling to put in the hard work, he did not have enough plays to teach, so Jiang Lao's thick intentions of support were wasted, and there were no achievements. He also never had the opportunity to show his face in the south. Now, Li's golden age has passed, and the trees on his benefactor's grave have grown thick. Even if he wants to work hard and make progress, it is too late. He has no economic support, and it is very difficult to form a troupe in Beijing, let alone perform in other places. After the four famous dan, no one has taken over the male actors. Xiangyun originally had very good material for acting, and also had strong support, but unfortunately he did not improve himself, thinking that with Jiang Lao, he would not have to worry about economic problems. He showed his talent ten years ago, but he was not as popular as Zhang Junqiu, who became famous later, and was highly praised by the society. It can be seen that most of the actors who enjoy great fame come from hardship and poverty. When they are about to become famous or have not yet become famous, having a patron will hinder the development of their studies. New actors who have just enjoyed great fame should take this as a warning. Zang Languang's situation is similar to Xiangyun's. She studied acting with Huifang for a short time, and she did not practice hard in private. She is young and beautiful, busy with social activities, and very fond of dressing up. Although she occasionally performed once in three or five months in Beijing, they were all temporary troupes, only performing her few signature plays. (172)
