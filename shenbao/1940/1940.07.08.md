### Zhang Zizhong's Coffin Arrives in Chongqing, Receiving the Utmost Honor and Mourning

Chongqing - General Zhang Zizhong, the Commander-in-Chief of a certain Chinese Army, was loyal, courageous, and outstanding, and had repeatedly established meritorious service. He was trusted by the central government. During the Battle of Henan and Hubei, on the day of Zhongxiang, he advanced north along the Hanshui River. The General led his troops to launch a flank attack first, followed by annihilation, achieving great victories and laying the foundation for victory. Unexpectedly, the fierce battle was still in progress, and the star of the General suddenly fell. He died heroically near Nanguadian on May 16th. When the tragic news arrived, the whole country was shocked and mourned. In addition to the grand ceremony of commendation by the central government and the holding of a memorial service and handling of all post-mortem mourning affairs on a selected date, it was decided to specially honor Zhang, who had made outstanding achievements and was promoted to Deputy Commander of the ××th Army in the spring of the 27th year, and was promoted to the rank of General of the Army. His responsibilities became heavier, and the General's heart to serve the country became even more urgent. During the Battle of Henan and Hubei, his meritorious achievements were remarkable, and they will last as long as the mountains and rivers of Han and Gao.

Circumstances of Death in Battle

General Zhang was extraordinarily brave, and it had become his unusual habit to lead his troops in every battle. This time, he died in the service of the country. During the recent Battle of Henan and Hubei, the left wing of the Japanese army surrounded Zhongxiang and advanced north. The General waited until most of them had passed before launching a fierce interception, winning every battle and being invincible. Corpses piled up like mountains on the western foothills of the Dahong Mountains, all of which were the great results of the General's fearless efforts. Afterwards, most of the group was surrounded by the Japanese army at Zao Yang. The remnants of the Japanese left-wing group broke through and fled. On the 16th, at Chen Shi, they arrived in Chongqing safely at Chen Shi today. Chairman Chiang personally led the Standing Committee of the Central Committee and the ministers to the river to welcome the coffin and preside over the funeral affairs. He also requested the Central Committee to issue a special order to Commander Zhang, a loyal and courageous man, to pay for the funeral expenses of 100,000 silver dollars, and at the same time to issue 50,000 silver dollars for the funeral expenses of Division Commander Zheng Shizhen. In addition to recording his life's achievements and sending them to the Political History Committee for preservation, Chairman Chiang will personally draft the deeds of Zhang and Zheng. The children of General Commander Zhang and Commander Zhong will be raised by the Central Executive Committee of the Party until they reach adulthood. The officers and soldiers who died at the same time will be investigated by their respective chiefs and given preferential treatment. It is hereby ordered that those who died in the same battle include Division Commander Zhong Yi. When Division Commander Zhong was defeated, he personally led a group of brave soldiers to intercept the retreating Japanese, fighting fiercely and killing countless enemies. The Japanese then used their full force to encircle them in layers. Zhong encouraged. The proposed plan is to formulate and promulgate the administrative guidelines for each county. (Dispatch, 6th)

### National Government Issues a Clear Order to Commend Zhang Zizhong and Others; Zhang Zizhong is Posthumously Promoted to Army General; The Executive Yuan Decides to Enshrine Him in the Martyrs' Shrine

Chongqing - National Government Order of the 7th: (1) The late Lieutenant General of the Army with the honorary title of Army General, Zhang Zizhong, is posthumously promoted to Army General. This order is issued. (2) Army General Zhang Zizhong, Commander-in-Chief of the 33rd Army, has long shouldered military responsibilities and has been known for his loyalty and integrity. After the Lugouqiao Incident, he fought on the front lines and repeatedly made outstanding contributions. His deeds are recorded and sent to the National History Museum to honor his loyalty and heroism. This order applies to (4) Division Commander Zheng Zuomin of the 9th Army, who was loyal and upright and held himself to high standards. He graduated from the Huangpu Military Academy at an early age and was determined to serve the country. Later, he followed the army in the Northern Expedition and immediately made meritorious service. Since the War of Resistance, he has led his troops in battles and repeatedly achieved. The proposal states that it is heard that prestige is proclaimed on the battlefield, and the tripod bells honor the loyalty of the great general. His spirit is as strong as the mountains and rivers, and he enjoys the worship of the ancestral hall in spring and autumn. Therefore, it is necessary to inspire the morale of the soldiers, make the tigers roar in the frontier, boost the morale of the army, and delight the souls of the dead. It is found that Commander-in-Chief Zhang Zizhong of the 33rd Army has made repeated meritorious contributions since the War of Resistance. In the battles of Linyi, Feishui, Taierzhuang, and Suizao, he was able to independently lead a battle and display his strategy. Recently, in northern Hubei and southern Henan, the Commander-in-Chief personally led a strong army and repeatedly won victories. He wanted to show the courage of a drum, not avoiding the danger of going deep into the enemy's territory. He sent a heroic army to cut off the Japanese retreat. Because the ratio of the number of people was too different, he calmly died for his country. Although the great star has fallen, his spirit will last forever. He has both success and benevolence. He has assisted the leader of the country and defended the Party-state. He is loyal and courageous, and does not hesitate to sacrifice himself. He should be enshrined in the Martyrs' Shrine to comfort his heroic spirit. The brave deeds of the martyrs will be revealed at home and abroad to show their loyalty and heroism and to pay tribute to them.

The General's Experiences

General Zhang's name is Zizhong, also known as Jinchen, and he is from Linqing County, Shandong Province. He was born with loyalty and had a strong sense of integrity. In his youth, he studied law and politics and deeply understood the importance of governing the country, that military preparedness comes first. Therefore, he abandoned his pen and joined the army. For more than ten years in the army, he always had a book in his hand and was as gentle as a Confucian scholar. However, his diligence, prudence, integrity, and his courage and decisiveness in times of crisis were unmatched even by ancient famous generals. In the fifth year of the Republic, he served under Mr. Feng Huanzhang. Commander Feng talked with him and was very impressed. He was promoted from platoon leader to division commander. His outstanding achievements in the Battle of Xifengkou were praised by the world. He was extremely strict with himself and generous with others. He later served as Chairman of Chahar Province and Mayor of Tianjin. In the midst of complex government affairs, he did not forget to train soldiers. When the July 7th Incident occurred, he was promoted to army commander. At the Leiba Drum Shandong Foothills area, the general led a part of a certain division and pursued the Japanese on light horses. He was unexpectedly ambushed by the Japanese counterattack, and was suddenly shot in the left arm. People asked him to return to the camp for treatment, but the general resolutely refused and still fought bravely as before, from noon to the end, before finally defeating the remnant Japanese. Unfortunately, he was shot in the chest again. The general knew that he had been seriously injured, so he drew the short sword given to him by the chairman, intending to kill himself. He was seized by his adjutant, Zhu. The general then said to his subordinates with emotion, "My conscience is clear to the country, the nation, the commander, and myself. Everyone must work harder for the country." After saying these words, he died.

Post-Mortem Honors

When the general's coffin arrived in Chongqing, it was personally welcomed by the President and received the utmost honor and mourning. The Military Affairs Commission issued a telegram that said, "The coffin of General Commander Zhang Zizhong of the ×th Army inspires his subordinates. We, as soldiers, should resist desperately at this critical moment. If necessary, we should keep a bullet for ourselves to drink." At that time, only forty to fifty people were left in Zhong's unit, and the Japanese attacked with nearly a thousand cavalry. As a result, all of them sacrificed themselves one after another. Their loyalty, courage, and perseverance were no less than that of Zhang. In addition, there were Division Commander Zheng Zuomin, who died for his country in the Battle of Kunlun Pass, and Army Commander Chen Anbao, who sacrificed himself for the country in the Battle of Nanchang. Their heroic and moving deeds are too numerous to mention. (Dispatch, 6th)

### The Enmity Between Britain and France and the Future of World Affairs

Since Nazi Germany employed its original blitzkrieg strategy in this European war and repeatedly achieved great results, military theory has undergone a sudden change and promoted opportunities for comprehensive innovation. As a result, various treacherous and abrupt events have occurred in the international arena, like unpredictable thunder and rain. This is none other than an implied effect of the blitzkrieg strategy, and this style has expanded from the purely military field to the political and diplomatic spheres. For example, the British Navy's sudden attack on French warships in North Africa on the third day of this month, and the worsening of Anglo-French relations, is another most shocking scene since the French armistice. World affairs are becoming increasingly intense, and everything is beyond the grasp of common sense, normal feelings, and general reason. Furthermore, the more the chaos spreads, the more acute the conflicts become, and the debate over theory and right and wrong will inevitably become more chaotic until it becomes impossible to investigate. Then, both sides of the warring countries will gradually abandon their attacks and contentions based on white and black, and turn to fighting for life and death. As the saying goes, "When life comes to this, there is no point in discussing the ways of heaven." The unprecedented catastrophe of the world's population is now in full swing.

The British warships' action in North Africa this time is probably the first time the Allied forces have taken the initiative to attack since the outbreak of the European war last fall. The results achieved are far beyond those of the Battle of the Falkland Islands in South America. Although this is only a scene of a friendly alliance turning into hostility, not a direct confrontation between hostile countries, we cannot but recognize the significant military achievement of the British side this time, regardless of whether France and Britain will eventually go from breaking off diplomatic relations to fighting each other. If the announcements issued by the British side after the event do not contain exaggeration, then more than half of the French navy, known as the second in Europe, has been taken into British hands or destroyed. Compared with the combined strength of the British navy today and the remnants of the German, Italian, and French navies that can be used by Germany and Italy, Britain has an absolute advantage. After France and Germany made peace, the French navy issue, which was of common concern to the world, has now come to an end. After the trials of the South American and Mediterranean campaigns, it is further confirmed that Britain's maritime authority cannot be easily underestimated.

Even if the British naval power is very strong, it cannot be hastily concluded that it is sufficient to guarantee the safety of Britain and the chances of victory in the war. Due to the progress of three-dimensional warfare tactics in recent years, the power of naval vessels at sea has been greatly reduced. The German navy is not developed, and now it is almost completely destroyed, but its air force can often cause trouble for the invincible British navy. The sinking of the British aircraft carrier Glorious in the waters of Narvik is one example. On the other hand, there are still many military experts in various countries who admire the functions of warships and despise the role of the air force at sea. It is said that the British military aircraft are indeed superior in performance to those used by Germany and Italy, but the quantity is far from sufficient. Therefore, in the subsequent Anglo-German war situation, the main struggle will be the British navy's decisive battle against the German and Italian air forces. Its merits and demerits, as well as the position of the sea and air forces in today's war, still need to be proven by future facts. As for the new situation caused by the deterioration of Anglo-French relations in various parts of the world, it is even more complicated. The saying that the Pétain government has declared war on Britain is now rampant. If it unfortunately becomes a reality, it will further increase the strangeness and complexity of the current war situation. It may not have a major impact on the military aspect, but the stimulation it adds to the psychology of the world will be profound and enormous, and will increasingly make people aware of the impermanence of international separation, alliance, and enmity today. After France, a first-class power, suddenly suffered defeat, its national policy formed a huge angle of change. The feelings of its authorities and the situation of its people are difficult to imagine. And the French colonies in various parts of the world, since the peace between France and Germany, various units have had their own opinions. Their movements are still not very clear. After this incident, their orientation and trend will become more subtle. In the Near East, Britain and France have stationed heavy troops. The areas of North Africa have had military joint defense in the past. The territories of both sides are closely connected and their interests are similar, especially in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and the colonies in South Asia. In the difficult situation of the new and old continents, they have the importance of affecting the whole body with a single hair. Its impact has far exceeded the gains and losses of the European war itself. This is what the world should pay special attention to.

The European war has lasted for ten months so far, and now it has entered the decisive stage of close combat. During these ten months, the change in the map of Europe and the change in the national conditions of various countries have been faster and more dramatic than any era in European history. The struggle will be more tragic and the changes will be faster. I don't know what kind of strange and different traces will be created to decorate this tragic era. It is hoped that the warring countries will be able to stop in moderation, not go too far, and not be too concerned about the grievances and revenge, so as to avoid sowing the seeds of renewed killing for the next generation of people. Then, although the destruction of the war is said to be tragic, it is not merely a sacrifice without value.

### Third Anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction: Central Government Joint Commemoration, Chairman Lin Delivers Speech Explaining Three Points

Chongqing - Today is the third anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. The Central Party Headquarters and the National Government jointly held a commemoration ceremony at the National Government Auditorium at 6:00 AM. Over 500 people, including members of the Central Committee and heads of various agencies, attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony, and three minutes of silence were observed for the soldiers who died in the war and the compatriots who perished. The ceremony was solemn and respectful. After the silence, Chairman Lin delivered a speech (Commemoration Speech for the Third Anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction). After the speech, the ceremony concluded.

Chairman Lin's Speech

Chairman Lin's speech briefly stated that on this day in the previous year, the first anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, I had expressed several points of view, concluding that (victory in the War of Resistance is certain) and (national reconstruction will surely succeed). These are inevitable outcomes that we should not doubt or hesitate about. Now, two full years have passed in the War of Resistance. During these two years, there have been many changes in military, political, and international affairs. Although these changes are complex, they all ultimately prove this conclusion. Now, I will briefly explain this point of view. First, regarding the military aspect, we have moved from a passive position to an active one, from a stalemate to an offensive position. We are indeed getting stronger with each battle. This has been the case in the past, and it will inevitably be even more advantageous for us in the future. This can be inferred. Therefore, in terms of the military, we can confidently say that our difficult period has passed. The situation will undoubtedly improve day by day. I hope that our loyal and brave soldiers and the compatriots of the entire nation will remain steadfast in their faith and continue to work hard to achieve final victory. Second, regarding the political aspect, the Japanese have long known that they are mired in a military quagmire, so they have had to change their tactics and make every effort to attack politically. However, their political offensive can be said to have yielded no results. Third, regarding the international aspect, the international changes in the past year have been unprecedented. The war clouds in Europe are dense, and the causes, consequences, rights, and wrongs are complex and cannot be explained in a few words. We do not need to discuss them now. However, in this great war, we can clearly recognize that in today's age of scientific advancement, if the military strength of both sides is not evenly matched, they must rely on the loyalty and patriotism of their people to win. A country with inferior military equipment can be assured of victory if it maintains a strong will and fights bravely. As you all know, in the European theater, some countries perished in less than a day, and some surrendered in a few months. They could not maintain their main force in the war of resistance, and their faith in the war of resistance wavered, leading to a complete collapse. I believe that the greatest difficulty for a country with inadequate military equipment fighting against a country with strong military equipment is in the initial stages of the war, and the most important weapon is the psychology of the people. If there are any errors in the initial strategy or if the national character is slightly weak, they will inevitably succumb to the path of surrender due to being unable to withstand setbacks. It cannot be denied that our national defense was not very strong in the past. However, as a result of the three years of the War of Resistance, our strength in the War of Resistance has only increased day by day and never decreased. The spirit of resistance throughout our nation has only become more solid and never wavered. From this, it can be seen that the combat skills of our loyal and brave soldiers and the national character of our compatriots are not only comparable to those of the advanced countries in Europe, but also worthy of great confidence. The difficult initial stages of the war have long passed, as mentioned above. Moreover, judging from the international situation, it further strengthens our confidence in the War of Resistance. From now on, as long as we work hard according to the established policy and persevere, the ultimate victory is beyond doubt. The above three points are very simple and straightforward explanations of (victory in the War of Resistance) and (national reconstruction will surely succeed). In particular, the international situation is our best lesson. I can even say that the various situations in the military, political, and international aspects in the past year have all served as factual proof of my (victory in the War of Resistance) and (national reconstruction will surely succeed). Today, on this anniversary, I am speaking to you all specifically. (7th Dispatch)

Kong Xiangxi and Others Publish Essays

Chongqing - Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, recently published an article on the occasion of the third anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident, explaining the state of China's finances after three years of the War of Resistance. The article stated that the reason why China's finances have been able to remain stable is due to the following factors: (1) The government established a solid foundation before the war; (2) There have been abundant harvests in the past three years; (3) Funds have been used effectively; (4) Remittances from overseas Chinese have been substantial; (5) Sympathy and assistance from foreign countries have been continuous. (6th Dispatch from Havas)

Chongqing - General Chen Cheng, Director of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, recently published a commemorative essay on the third anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident, advocating that the Chinese army should have two to three years of preparation before adopting an offensive in China. He stated, "Those who demand an immediate counter-offensive are making judgments that are too hasty. Once a full-scale counter-offensive begins, it cannot be completed in a few months. I believe that our army is already in an offensive position at this time, which is completely different from a purely defensive position." (6th Dispatch from Havas)

Chongqing - Today, mass rallies are being held throughout China to pay respects to the Chinese soldiers who died in the war. Flags are hung on all buildings, and decorated arches have been built on the roads. Special delegations are visiting various military hospitals and the families of front-line officers and soldiers to offer condolences. Today has the atmosphere of a national holiday and is called "National War of Resistance and Revival Day." All newspapers have published commemorative articles written by military and civilian leaders. Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui gave a radio speech, stating that no matter how the international situation develops, China will continue to resist. Foreign Minister Wang also warned the great powers that Japan is gradually taking over the interests of foreigners in the Far East. He also mentioned that Japan is now putting pressure on Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Burma, and is also making demands on foreign concessions in order to block China's international trade lines. Economic Minister Weng Wenhao's speech continued to describe the development of domestic defense industries. It is said that there are now three steel plants whose steel production is sufficient to meet China's military needs. Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin recounted the major military events in the Sino-Japanese War. (7th Dispatch from Reuters)

Chongqing - Today, China has entered the fourth year of the Sino-Japanese War. China's resistance has become more determined, and it is increasingly confident in its ability to develop military industries and in the ineffectiveness of Japan's economic blockade. Government leaders have made public statements on the third anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident, believing that Japan has lost its main driving force and has changed its offensive to a defensive posture. They all read that since the Japanese army occupied Nanjing, the Japanese have never gained an important strategic location in China. In summary, the words of Chinese leaders generally stated that, politically, China has made progress on the road to democracy during these three years of resistance, while Japan is abandoning its parliamentary politics and returning to anarchy. Economically, Japan's blockade has become ineffective because China is already manufacturing its own weapons and ammunition to cope with this undeclared war, and heavy industries have been established in many areas not occupied by the Japanese army. China will receive more international sympathy and assistance. Japan, which is changing its foreign policy as the world situation changes, only sees itself becoming increasingly isolated.

### Situation in Hong Kong Gradually Eases, Refugees Continue to Arrive in Manila

Hong Kong - Although thousands of foreign women and children have left Hong Kong, the Hong Kong border is quite quiet today, and there are few troops stationed there. The reporter went to Shatoujiao for inspection and only saw one Japanese sentry standing behind a sandbag bunker, exposed to the sun, leaning on his rifle.

### Rumors That Germany Will Launch a Large-Scale Attack on Britain Within Ten Days, Aerial Slaughter as Its Strategy

Swedish Capital - German sources recently predicted that Germany will launch a blitzkrieg against Britain within ten days. Next Tuesday may be the day to launch this attack. It is also predicted that German aircraft will continuously bomb London for six days, dropping more than 3,000 bombs each day. These bombing aircraft will use previously unused methods. During the air raid, many bombers will be equipped with bomb-carrying gliders. This device can be released far from the target. After six days of continuous bombing, paratroopers will land in Britain to fight. (7th Dispatch from United Press)

London - Today, both the Sunday Observer and The Times discussed the possibility of Britain being invaded. Garvin also published an article in the Observer, strongly asserting the need to maintain air superiority over the "island fortress" in the coming critical weeks. In his book "How to Fight—Opinions on Being Invaded," Garvin said that the main goals of German strategy are to confuse the British fleet, disperse the British air force, and induce Britain to waste its military strength. A more knowledgeable writer on the German side explained the meaning of concentrating attacks on a dispersed defense. The enemy's principle of action is persistence, but their implementation is flexible. The German General Staff uses speed, weight, and direction to shock the opponent with an unprecedented level of dedication. In the war of attacking Britain, the Germans will use various methods to seize all of our land in order to disperse Britain's defensive forces. The most important event for us is to find a way to arrange our military deployment so that the most powerful attack can move in any direction with the special speed of modernization. In the middle of the war, there may be various unprecedented totals and adventures. In the midst of contradictory information, we must quickly distinguish between falsehood and the difference between subsidized attempts and real dangers. We must resist the enemy's main military attack and destroy it. Our own doctrine must be offensive in nature, not passive defense. We must remember that all of our assets, our sea power today, are of unprecedented greatness. In a sense, Britain is still an island, surrounded by oceans, which do not allow the enemy to carry out military aggression on the same scale as on the continent. The German invasion of Britain is completely different from the conquest of Europe, so we must not misunderstand the maritime situation. In addition, there is a major air problem, which is the decisive area. The enemy's preferred means of aggression is aerial slaughter, bombing ports and munitions factories. Hitler has relied on his superior air power from the beginning, and this time he will use all his strength. Hitler may stake most of his reserve forces on this one move, so in the next six weeks, the hope and life of the nation will depend on the immortal achievements of our air force's combat and technical quality.

Tokyo, today's news: The University Professors' Association of Japan recently inquired of students' families, asking whether Japan should wage war against the United States if the United States interfered with Japan and prevented it from obtaining war materials from the Dutch East Indies. The result was that only 14% of those surveyed favored Japan going to war with the United States. A total of 45,666 families were surveyed, and only 11,789 responded. Among those who responded, 40% still advocated not going to war with the United States, 6,247 favored war with the United States, and 1,334 strongly opposed Japan going to war with the United States. The children of these families are students at prominent universities in Japan. The opinions of these families generally seem to suggest that Japan should not get involved in the European war as a means of resolving the Sino-Japanese War. Among the 11,789 who responded, 30% were unwilling to wage war against the United States, 1,508 advocated getting involved in the European war, and 7,255 expressed extreme opposition.

Among them, 1,181 favored a treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union, and 531 strongly opposed it. Furthermore, Japanese students' families mostly hope that Germany will defeat Britain, with only 344 favoring a British victory, while 9,697 favor backing Germany. Regarding the political party issue, the majority of families favor a single political party. Among them, only 389 favor the existing political party system, while 6,939 favor a single-party system.

### British Newspaper Observes International Situation; Possibility of World Powers Forming Great Blocs

London: The diplomatic correspondent of the Sunday Observer claims that diplomatic circles are now openly discussing the possibility of a realignment of world powers into great blocs. One is a Southern Catholic Europe, including France, Spain, and Italy, with the potential to include Rhineland Bavaria in Germany and its 30 million Catholic population. The former Prime Minister of France and member of the Pétain government, Laval, has been working on this plan for years. This bloc would naturally be anti-British, anti-Prussian, and anti-Soviet. Another bloc would consist of Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States, with the aim of resisting Germany's ambition to dominate Europe and Japan's ambition to dominate the Far East. The correspondent also mentioned the meeting between Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky and British Prime Minister Churchill on July 3, stating that this meeting was at least partly related to the military and diplomatic complications arising from Romania's entry into Germany's embrace in the Near East. The Soviet side believes that in order to defend against German incursions into the Black Sea, it is impossible to ignore the Mediterranean Sea and other such incidents.

### Alexandria French Fleet Disarmed Without Resistance; Implemented Smoothly with Mutual Understanding; "Dunkerque" Runs Aground and is Hit by Six Bombs

London: Colonel Jones, the former British leader of the delegation to Syria, delivered a broadcast today from Cairo to his former comrades, revealing for the first time the details of the disarming of the French fleet in Alexandria without resistance. He said that the disarming of the French fleet in Alexandria was implemented smoothly and with mutual understanding, which is attributable to the friendship between the British and French sailors. According to French sources in Algeria, as a result of the British operation in Mers-el-Kébir, three large French ships and one small ship have run aground. Only 200 survivors were found from the French battleship "Bretagne" (its normal crew was 1,133). The ship is now in the harbor. In addition, on two battleships, the "Dunkerque" and "Provence," and the destroyer Mogador, there were a total of 200 deaths, 150 serious injuries, and one missing person. (Reuter's dispatch of the 7th)

London: The British Admiralty stated that the French battlecruiser "Dunkerque" was damaged as a result of the British fleet's action on July 3 and ran aground in Mers-el-Kébir. The extent of the damage is unknown, but it is seriously damaged and cannot participate in battle even if it falls into enemy hands. After the engagement in Mers-el-Kébir, the French fleet commander sent a signal stating that the ship had lost its combat capability and ordered the crew to abandon ship. In view of the French commander's declaration ordering the crew to abandon ship, the British considered it unnecessary to issue a warning before continuing to attack the "Dunkerque." Yesterday morning, British aircraft attacked this French ship and scored six hits. Two British aircraft did not return. The "Dunkerque" was built in 1935, with a displacement of 26,500 tons, carrying a crew of 1,381, and a speed of 29-31 knots. It is one of the fastest capital ships afloat. The ship has heavy armor and is armed with eight 13-inch guns, sixteen 5-inch guns, and forty-four other smaller caliber guns. (Reuter's dispatch of the 7th)

An airfield somewhere in Britain: Yesterday, American-made reconnaissance aircraft were flying over the North Sea, performing reconnaissance duties for the British Royal Air Force. These aircraft flew back and forth over the coasts of the Netherlands and Belgium and the ports of Norway, searching for German troops, aircraft, and warships that Hitler planned to use to invade England.

### President Roosevelt Publicly Issues Statement; Elaborates on Monroe Doctrine; Territorial Issues Should be Resolved Through Consultation; Similar Attitude Towards Europe and Asia

Washington: President Roosevelt publicly issued a statement last night stating that he, on behalf of the United States, reiterates that the country has no territorial ambitions abroad and expresses his appreciation for the support of various countries in Europe and Asia for the United States' Monroe Doctrine. The statement said that the redistribution of territories after the European war should be done through consultations between various continents or hemispheres. The President authorized his secretary, Mr. O'Reilly, to issue the following statement on the principle of "The Americas belong to the Americans, Europe belongs to the Europeans, and Asia belongs to the Asians": "The United States has absolutely no intention of interfering in the territories of Europe and Asia. What the government wants to see and implement is that every continent in the world can establish its own 'Monroe Doctrine.' The United States will not seek to acquire new territories, nor does it have such intentions. However, should a victorious Germany demand territory within this hemisphere from the countries it has conquered, we will consider that move to be in conflict with our Monroe Doctrine. According to that doctrine, the United States will not take any islands belonging to the defeated countries, but believes that the best way to dispose of these territories is to have the countries of the Americas decide publicly. Regarding French Indochina, the government believes that it is best to have all the countries of Asia sit down and consider various proposals regarding that island, and the same goes for Europe." Finally, the statement proposed that the Pan-American Conference to be held in Havana on July 20 should discuss the disposal of colonies in this hemisphere belonging to various defeated European countries. At the same time, the State Department announced that the Executive Committee of the Pan-American Conference has formally endorsed the three principles of the Havana Conference: neutrality, protection of peace in the Western Hemisphere, and economic cooperation. (Associated Press dispatch of the 7th)

### United States Considers Asian Nations Should Decide on French Indochina

Hyde Park: President Roosevelt's secretary, Mr. O'Reilly, issued a statement to reporters yesterday, stating that the Monroe Doctrine should be applied to Europe and Asia as a tool to establish an agreement regarding the disposal of the territories of defeated countries. Mr. O'Reilly said that he was relaying the President's opinion. Mr. O'Reilly's remarks were made after President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull discussed the exchange of notes between the United States and Germany regarding the interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine. According to Mr. O'Reilly, the President believes that the countries of Europe, Asia, and the Americas should each convene meetings within their own areas and resolve territorial issues themselves, rather than allowing the victorious countries to decide arbitrarily. Mr. O'Reilly supported Secretary Hull's declaration that the United States should continue to implement the Monroe Doctrine, saying that if Germany demands all the territories of France, Britain, and the Netherlands in the Western Hemisphere, the United States does not intend to make efforts to take over these territories but will invite the countries of the Americas to decide whether to place these territories under a trusteeship system until they can be returned to their original owners. Mr. O'Reilly also said that the President stated that the United States has no intention of interfering in land issues related to the adjustment of Europe or Asia. What the American government wants to see, and what it believes should be, is the implementation of the Monroe Doctrine in Europe and Asia, which is consistent with the interpretation and implementation of this doctrine in the Western Hemisphere. As an example, regarding French Indochina, the United States believes that all the countries of Asia should consult and reach a decision. The disputes in Europe and Asia should be resolved by the countries of Europe and Asia themselves, while the disposal and management of the islands and other territories of the countries conquered by Germany within the Western Hemisphere should be resolved by the countries of the Americas. A reporter asked if Germany held the view that the Monroe Doctrine would only be effective if the United States did not interfere in European affairs. Mr. O'Reilly replied that he was talking about the transfer of territorial ownership, while the German note, as far as he knew, was about political interference. In other words, the United States and Germany seemed to have different opinions on the interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine. (Reuter's dispatch of the 7th)

### United States Watching Situation in the West Indies; Warships Sail to Martinique

Washington: American warships set sail today for the French island of Martinique in the Caribbean Sea. The island currently has several French warships, which have raised fears of British and French battles occurring in the American neutrality zone. It is reported that several neutral patrol destroyers left St. Thomas Island in the Virgin Islands last night, ordered to investigate the situation around Martinique. Officials here say that the American ships will strictly adhere to the role of observers, and one of their important missions is to warn American ships in the area in the event of a conflict between Britain and France in Martinique. French naval power on the island includes several submarines, several small surface warships, and the unconfirmed report of the aircraft carrier "Béarn." The French Navy appeared to be awaiting the second step of the British Navy's actions last night, believing that the British would demand that the French forces surrender, agree to cooperate with Britain to sink their warships, or go to war. French diplomats here said that the situation has temporarily stalled, and the French authorities in Martinique have announced that they are affiliated with the Pétain government, which signed a peace treaty with Germany. (Associated Press dispatch of the 7th)

Washington: The British Navy is now blockading a French aircraft carrier and several submarines off the island of Martinique. It is reported that the US Navy has dispatched five destroyers to rush to the vicinity of the island to investigate the current situation. Mr. Hull said that the United States' "neutral patrol" is now clearing the seas and detecting lurking warplanes at the doorstep of the United States. Although British officials do not recognize the blockade of Martinique, if the French ships are ordered to return to their home ports and risk entering international waters, the British Navy may intercept them. Mr. Hull also said that the republics of the Americas are currently watching the development of the situation on the island in order to take joint action.

### Japan Anxious Over U.S. Embargo

Tokyo: Based on the law recently signed by U.S. President Roosevelt, the President has the right to order a ban on the export of any military supplies that are needed for U.S. defense. The Asahi Shimbun recently published an article commenting on the consequences, stating that the Japanese business community is extremely concerned about this matter and believes that the only way to deal with it is to establish a self-sufficient system among the countries of the Japanese financial group. Although the enactment of this new U.S. law may not worsen the current business relationship between Japan and the United States, Japan cannot help but feel great anxiety about the future of this matter. Officials of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry even believe that if relations between Japan and the United States become strained in the future, President Roosevelt can use the powers granted by this law as "a powerful and effective tool to deal with Japan." However, some well-informed sources say that, as far as the current situation is concerned, President Roosevelt's signing of this law is different from a genuine blockade of military supplies exports. For example, the U.S. government once announced a ban on the export of machine tools, and at that time, some people worried that American-made machine tools would completely disappear, but the fact proved that, except for those that directly conflicted with the needs of American industry, others were still exported as usual.

### New York Times on Australia's Future; Has Significant Relationship with the United States

New York: The New York Times published an editorial today on Australia's future, saying that as long as the danger of British sea power being destroyed has not been eliminated, and as long as Japan continues its ambitions to dominate Asia, Australia's position will require the consideration of the United States, or require a major decision by the United States. The existence of the democratic federations of Australia and New Zealand, in many ways, will be more important to us in the coming years than the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines. Australia and New Zealand can help ensure that the flame of democracy never goes out, no matter what happens to the Old World, and the value of these two places will not change. Therefore, we should often think about their position today and think hard about it. (Reuter's dispatch of the 7th)

Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Hull told reporters that he will attend the conference in the Cuban capital, where about ten to fifty issues will be discussed, and the establishment of U.S. Air Force bases in Latin America will be one of them. Information is currently being collected on the British blockade of the French West Indian port of Martinique to continue the policy of continuing to discuss common economic, political, and military issues to defend against factual or threatened dangers. The British and French embassies in the United States have both stated that they have not received news of the port being blockaded. However, one British official said that since the beginning of the war, British ships have been patrolling near the West Indies. (Reuter's dispatch of the 7th)

### US Industrial Centers Intensify Security to Prevent Explosive Sabotage

Washington – According to a reporter's investigation, the United States federal authorities are secretly working to strengthen day and night security at industrial centers across the country to prevent sabotage. Due to the occurrence of several serious bombing cases in the past week, the authorities are stepping up precautions to guard against America's "Fifth Column." The Federal Bureau of Investigation has significantly expanded its investigative capabilities due to recent Congressional approval of additional funding, recruiting 600 new detectives. Another 100 are currently undergoing training in Quantico. News has also just been received from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, that three individuals plotted to bomb the DuPont company, whose capital amounts to 200 million yuan. Fortunately, an anonymous phone call foiled the plan. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is now apprehending these three, who were attempting to bury explosives under the factory wall. The police arrived promptly upon receiving the tip, and the three abandoned four crates of explosives and fled. As for the bombing case at the British Pavilion at the New York World's Fair on July 4th, the New York Police Department is making every effort to investigate and apprehend the bomber. On May 29th, a tall, dark man stole 30 crates of explosives from a construction site. This man appears to be Irish and is highly suspected of criminal activity. (July 7th International Dispatch)

### Admiral Yarnell Delivers Speech Advocating US War Against Germany and Italy

Iowa City – Retired former Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, delivered a speech here today, stating that the United States should join Britain in waging war against Germany and Italy. He said, "It is evident that the United States will one day have to fight against totalitarian nations. We would rather fight today, so that we may not have to fight again in the future." Admiral Yarnell also argued that if the United States "can supply Britain with a robust navy," the United States can save an estimated 1.5 billion US dollars in military spending.

### US Plans to Mobilize "Worker Army" to Promote Rearmament

Washington – World Design Committee member Harrington announced yesterday that the government is planning the mobilization of a "worker army" to promote US rearmament. The "worker army" is expected to be completed before September 1st. (July 7th International News Service Dispatch)

### New Romanian Prime Minister Broadcasts, Declaring Pro-German Policy; Adopts Intense Attitude Towards the Soviet Union; Anti-British Sentiment Progressing Rapidly

Bucharest – In his broadcast speech today, the new Romanian Prime Minister, Gigurtu, announced that conducting Romania's foreign policy within an "Axis" framework is an established fact. He also stated, "We are returning to Romania's old traditions through this policy. These traditions were previously disrupted by events that can no longer be implemented and were forced behind by the times. Now, joining the Axis is equivalent to a complete change in the internal political structure, controlled by an effective and creative nationalistic concept." The Prime Minister further said that the new government must first overcome various difficulties not caused by them. "After the last World War, we failed to consolidate what we gained in the war and failed to establish a foundation to ensure a peaceful future. Today, everything is clear." (July 7th Reuters Dispatch)

Belgrade, Yugoslavia – The situation in Romania seems to be rapidly moving towards the rejection of British interests, the most important of which is Romania's oil production. Its exports were stopped several weeks ago, but Germany still fully receives its monthly quota of 130,000 tons, aided by extra railway lines (currently being requisitioned by the Romanian authorities). The amount exported to Germany appears to be continuing to increase. Forty-five British male and female expatriates left Bucharest yesterday, 22 of whom were asked to leave immediately by the Romanian authorities, and the rest voluntarily left due to the unbearable situation. Since announcing its pro-Axis policy, the Romanian government seems to be proceeding at a pace exceeding Germany's expectations. German individuals in Romania are dissatisfied with the Gigurtu government because Gigurtu's thorough Nazi policy towards the Soviet Union is considered too intense. The Soviet Union remains an unpredictable factor in the Romanian situation, and this matter has not lost any of its explosive nature in recent days. At the same time, several Romanian newspapers have gradually shown hostility towards Britain. (July 7th Reuters Dispatch)

### Soviet Official Declares Romanian Army Sabotaged Transportation

Moscow – A representative of the Soviet People's Commissariat for Transportation told a TASS reporter that Romanian troops took away and destroyed telephone equipment, etc., during their retreat. For example, the radio station in Khotyn was also destroyed. However, telephone and telegraph communications in Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina have now been restored. Furthermore, before retreating, the Romanian army attempted to sabotage industrial and transportation enterprises, but local executive committees have adjusted food supplies and restored the activities of various shops and factories. At the same time, trams have also resumed operation. Moreover, the executive committee has allocated funds to open hospitals, where people can receive free medical treatment. Newspapers are being published and Soviet films are being screened. (July 7th TASS Dispatch)

Bucharest – An official here announced last night that an accident occurred regarding the evacuation of residents from Bessarabia and Bukovina when Jews and Communists were being sent to Bessarabia. Fortunately, the Romanian government took appropriate measures and quickly suppressed and stabilized the situation. Order has now been fully restored. (July 7th Reuter's Dispatch)

### Sino-German Cultural Association Holds Annual Meeting; Zhu Jiahua Delivers Opening Address

Chongqing Correspondence – The Sino-German Cultural Association held its fifth annual meeting on the evening of the 7th at the Jialing Guesthouse. Attendees included Honorary Chairman Chen Lifu, represented by Gu Yuxiu, representatives from the Ministry of Social Affairs, Ren Xiping and Meng Jianmin, representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhu Shiming, representative from the German Embassy, Lu Yawen, and more than 130 Chinese and German members. First, Association President Zhu Jiahua delivered the opening address, followed by speeches from Gu Yuxiu and Meng Jianmin. Subsequently, Jiang Fuli reported on association affairs, and the association's articles of association were amended and a declaration was passed. Finally, Lu Yawen and Shen Ke, a representative from the German News Agency, gave speeches. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 PM. The following is a summary of Zhu Jiahua's opening address:

Opening Address

The Sino-German Cultural Association has a history of five years. During these five years, the world has been shrouded in the clouds of war, and East and West have been engulfed in flames. In such an environment, we are still able to promote cultural work, which is truly gratifying. And our holding of the fifth annual meeting of the Sino-German Cultural Association today is particularly special and significant. The whole world is living in war, which is a misfortune for mankind, and even more so for the cultural world. China has been fighting independently for three years to safeguard national independence and ethnic survival. China's national policy is unwavering, and the belief of the Chinese people is as firm as steel. Now, unfortunately, the European war is intensifying rapidly, and the damage suffered by human civilization is enormous and unimaginable. All those engaged in cultural work around the world are saddened and regretful. The spread and prolongation of the European war may result in mutual destruction, or even the destruction of human culture. The German people are particularly endowed with talent and intelligence, and their contribution to culture is admired by everyone. We hope that the German people can make greater contributions to human culture and make enormous efforts to lay the foundation for world peace. Since the seventeenth century, contact has gradually increased, and the relationship has become closer, especially in culture. The communication and promotion of culture between the two countries are closely related to the establishment of world peace. We deeply hope that people from China and Germany will shoulder the common mission and wish for success.

Declaration

Zhu then read a brief declaration, stating: The mission of the Sino-German Cultural Association is to connect the cultures of China and Germany, to promote and enhance them, and to promote the friendship between the two countries, so that it becomes more cordial. In recent years, the evolution of the international situation has affected the Far East. However, this has not hindered the promotion of cultural work between China and Germany in the slightest. We deeply hope that Germany can weigh the importance of matters in the Far East in a timely manner, determine what to adopt and what to discard, and especially hope that Sino-German relations will usher in a new era. We are willing to make sincere efforts to that end.

### Japan Labor Party Announces Dissolution

Tokyo – The Japan Labor Party announced its dissolution yesterday and issued a declaration, urging its members to join the National United Party, the only political party in Japan initiated by Konoe. (July 7th Reuter's Dispatch)

### Military Spokesman Discusses One Week of War Situation, June 29th to July 6th

Chongqing – The Military Commission issued a statement from a military spokesman regarding the war situation on various fronts, which has become increasingly fierce over the past week (June 29th to July 6th). The progress of operations is summarized as follows:

Guangdong and Guangxi

In Guangdong Province, Japanese troops landed in the Bao'an area over the weekend and advanced towards Shenzhen Shatoujiao and other places. After the Chinese army resisted step by step, they cut the Japanese army into several sections and annihilated them separately in Shatoujiao, Wangtianhu, Henggang, Longgang, Pingsu, and other places. The remaining Japanese troops fled towards Nantou, and the Chinese army is currently pursuing them. In southern Guangxi, the Japanese army began to invade west from Nanning last week, once invading Ningming, and later further invading Longling and the vicinity of Zhennanguan. According to the original plan of the Chinese army, the Japanese army was lured to favorable areas for repeated and painful annihilation. The Japanese suffered extremely heavy casualties, and fierce fighting is still ongoing.

Henan and Shanxi

In eastern Henan, the Chinese army has launched fierce attacks on various Japanese strongholds this week. On the morning of the 30th, they captured the northwest city wall of Kaifeng in one fell swoop and engaged in extremely fierce street battles with the Japanese. A small number of remaining Japanese troops retreated to the south of the city. Japanese reinforcements drove in to assist from Xinxiang, but were resisted at Caiyuan Station, resulting in heavy losses for the Japanese. At the same time, the Chinese army attacking Nanguan engaged in fierce street battles with the Japanese, killing more than 4,700 Japanese troops, destroying one Japanese armored train and dozens of cars. Another unit of the Chinese army captured Shangqiu at midnight on the 29th, and then captured Luyi Zhuxianzhen Mamuji and other places on the 30th, and took advantage of the victory to rush into the city of Hao County. On the afternoon of the 2nd, they recaptured Zhecheng, killing countless Japanese troops. The Chinese army is currently expanding its gains in victory.

Western Shanxi

The Japanese troops in the Liulin area have launched fierce attacks on Qikou Xingmen and other places this week. After being severely attacked by the Chinese army, the fighting was extremely fierce. Another unit of the Chinese army entered the area between Sanjiao and Lishi, cutting off the retreat of the Japanese army, attacking from both sides, and annihilating a large number of Japanese troops.

Hubei and Hunan

The Japanese troops trapped in western Xiangyang Jingguan Dangyang have been fiercely attacked and surrounded by the Chinese army this week, suffering extremely heavy casualties. More than a thousand Japanese troops have been killed in Xiaoyandunji, Jingdang. The Japanese troops in Yichang repeatedly attempted to cross the Yangtze River south bank, but were severely attacked by the Chinese army. After bloody battles for four days and four nights, the Japanese repeatedly reinforced, but were eventually completely wiped out by the Chinese army. A small number of surviving Japanese troops, who failed to escape, are hiding in the mountains, and the Chinese army is stepping up its mopping-up operations. At the same time, the Chinese army in eastern Xiangyang surrounded and attacked Yangzi Zhongxiang, recovering many strongholds outside Sui County, such as Leigudun. The Japanese were extremely panicked. Japanese warships on the Dongting Lake in northern Hunan have been harassing Lujiwan Muhupu Junshan and other places in recent days, but have been repeatedly bombarded by the Chinese army, suffering heavy damage. Between the 1st and 2nd, a total of two Japanese warships and five Japanese boats were sunk, and many more were injured. In addition, a certain unit of the Chinese army on land took advantage of the situation to launch a fierce attack on the Japanese army outside Yueyang, killing a large number of Japanese troops.

Jiangxi and Anhui

The fighting in the suburbs of Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, is still actively underway. After the Chinese army recovered the area around Xishan Wanshou Palace, the Japanese army repeatedly reinforced and counterattacked from Nanchang, but were all defeated. Taking advantage of the victory, they recovered strongholds such as Baijiashan and Yanjialing, and approached Niuhang Station. In this battle, about a thousand Japanese officers and soldiers, including the Japanese battalion commander, were killed, and a large amount of supplies were captured. In addition, the Chinese army attacking Wuning continued to capture strongholds such as Chengnan Nandong Youtou Mountain, and is currently launching an attack on the city. The Japanese army in Shouxian, northern Anhui, has been invading towards the Chinese army along the Shouliu Highway in recent days, but has been met with a head-on attack by the Chinese army. Another unit of the Chinese army attacked Su County, and the Japanese Jinpu Railway traffic has been cut off by the Chinese army.

Other

In addition, (1) Several thousand Japanese troops in Changzhou, Jurong, Jintan, Xishui, Yixing, and other places in southern Jiangsu have been invading Liyang in separate routes in recent days. After the Chinese army resisted in separate routes, a great battle lasted for four days, killing more than a thousand Japanese troops. The remaining Japanese troops fled in defeat. (2) The Chinese army advancing towards Daming in southern Hebei engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army in Yangqiao. Then, the Japanese army reinforced from Qingfeng Nanle. The bloody battle is still ongoing. The Chinese army in Jiaodong has been severely attacking the Japanese army in recent days, and the gains have been great. (3) In the battle south of Gaoyou in northern Jiangsu, more than three hundred Japanese troops, including the commander, were killed, and more than a hundred rifles were captured. (4) The Chinese air force bombed Yichang twice on the 29th and 4th, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese army and shooting down one Japanese plane. Japanese planes attacked Sichuan for days. Two were shot down by the Chinese air force on the 29th, and one was shot down again on the 4th. Another was shot down in the Xijiang River in southern Guangdong on the 30th. All of the above are important war achievements this week and are specially reported here. (July 7th)

### Japanese Blockade Plan for Vietnam Not a Fatal Blow to China

Hong Kong – Today, well-informed sources stated that Japan's forcing France to stop transporting all arms, gasoline trucks, and other military materials through Vietnam is a significant blow to China's arms purchases, but not effective. China's arms imports do not rely entirely on Vietnam. The land route from Lanzhou, Gansu, to the Soviet Union is still open. As for the Yunnan-Burma Road, it depends on Britain's attitude. Moreover, China is now able to manufacture all light weapons, such as machine guns, rifles, field guns, and hand grenades. The only thing that is causing trouble for government transportation companies is the large amount of trucks, auto parts, machinery, railway sleepers, and large quantities of gasoline stored in Haiphong, which must be transported to Yunnan via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway or to Guangxi via the Longzhou Highway. Vietnamese authorities have banned the transport of these goods since June 17th. However, all trucks, auto parts, and gasoline shipped from the United States arrived in Haiphong in early June. The United States may send representatives to negotiate with France and Japan regarding the goods detained in Vietnam, as these goods cannot be regarded as war materials and can be shipped via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway according to the Sino-French agreement. These sleepers were originally purchased for the construction of a new railway line from Kunming to Xuzhou (transliteration) in Sichuan (35 miles southwest of Chongqing), costing 480,000,000 French francs, borrowed from France, with the remaining customs revenue and the coal, iron, and copper mines along the new railway line as collateral. These mineral deposits were discovered during the construction of this new line. When this line is completed, Xuzhou will be directly connected to Haiphong, which will be beneficial to both China and Vietnam. It is not yet known to what extent the blockade of Vietnam will affect the construction of this new railway line. However, this road will not be very effective if goods cannot be transported through Vietnam. The blockade of Vietnam also affects Hong Kong, as most of the goods are shipped from the United States to Hong Kong by Pan-Pacific mail ships, and then shipped to Haiphong by ships. The blockade of Vietnam does not harm the Chinese Air Force, as most of China's fighter planes are purchased from Soviet Russia and some can be manufactured domestically. China's field guns are also mostly purchased from the Soviet Union via the Lanzhou Highway. This route avoids Japanese air raids and is most secure. The transport of arms from Europe to China has been greatly reduced since Germany launched its blitzkrieg tactics. (July 7th International News Service Dispatch)

### The Brilliant and Great July 7th Anniversary Was Solemnly Observed Yesterday; Special Precautions in the Concessions Prevented Accidents; Citizens' Moods Were Enthusiastic and Beliefs Were Strengthened

Yesterday was the third anniversary of the July 7th Incident. After three years of hard work and trials, the foundation for victory in the war of resistance and national reconstruction has been laid, and the solemn and brilliant new chapter of Chinese history will be opened with the start of the fourth year. Although the city's environment has worsened due to the impact of the European war, and no commemorative ceremonies were held, the general public was in high spirits. In addition to some enthusiastic individuals who voluntarily stopped entertainment and banquets to silently pay tribute to the generously martyred soldiers and civilians, or further donated money, people from all walks of life worked and carried out their activities in their respective positions, as usual, and their faces were full of optimism and determination. In the past year, world affairs have been like clouds, and the international community has been turbulent. Some independent countries have been enslaved, and some have suffered complete devastation. Even those great powers that have always been known for their wealth and strength have experienced rapid rise and fall, making people feel the vicissitudes of life. All of this is a great mirror, which is enough to reflect China's strong and unyielding spirit. Amidst the ever-changing world affairs, it stands proudly, like a giant. The Chinese nation's self-confidence has also been increased a hundredfold. Yesterday morning, after Chairman Chiang's various documents were published in various newspapers, his imposing spirit, piercing the sun and moon, and his resounding voice, like gold and stone, were enough to demonstrate that the final victory would surely belong to us. In addition to vigilance, the citizens were cheered and inspired. The following is a record of the activities of various parties yesterday:

Unprecedented Precautions; Strict Patrols

In view of the recent complex situation in the two concessions, the police authorities implemented unprecedented special precautions yesterday. All police personnel and special patrolmen were dispatched, distributed at various road intersections, and patrolled in batches. The red alert troops of the Public Concession and the armored vehicles of the French Concession patrolled everywhere all day yesterday to inspect the defense situation. British, American, French, and Scottish troops were also ordered to be dispatched yesterday, fully armed with live ammunition. In addition to posting guards at key traffic routes, they also patrolled in their respective defense areas in groups of three to five. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps and the French Volunteer Corps were also fully mobilized to assist the concession police in maintaining order. All fortresses in the city were also fully garrisoned with British and French troops, and the atmosphere was quite tense. However, due to the strict precautions, it was able to pass safely and no incident occurred that could cause disturbance. These special precautions were lifted at 6:00 PM last night.

Remote Paths and Alleys Were All Blocked

The police authorities of the two concessions sent personnel to seal off all the non-main roads in the city with barbed wire the night before. The work was completed overnight. Yesterday, on both sides of Avenue Edward VII, from east to west, except for the Bund, Henan Road, Fujian Road, Dongxin Bridge, Yu Qiaqing Road, Maho Road, Tongfu Road, Seymour Road, Shanlian Road, and other places, leaving a gap for vehicles and pedestrians to enter and exit, the remaining twenty or so roads were all blocked. The lanes and remote paths in the two concessions were also blocked at the same time. At each road where only a gap was left, five or six Chinese and foreign detectives were stationed on both sides to strictly check pedestrians and vehicles. Under the traffic lights at the center of the Great World, there was also a truck with dozens of British soldiers armed and stationed yesterday morning, with especially strict precautions. But they were withdrawn at noon. The situation on the Bund was also quite tense. Pedestrians and vehicles were checked one by one, and concession police and foreign defense forces were stationed at each pier, checking those who landed quite strictly. However, because people generally feared accidents, the number of ferries traveling in the Huangpu River was greatly reduced, presenting a rather lonely scene.

Traffic on Various Bridges Was Strictly Restricted

In order to take strict precautions, the Public Concession sealed off both ends of the Jiangxi Road Bridge and the Shanxi Road Bridge with barbed wire and sent police to guard them, prohibiting pedestrians and vehicles from passing through. Other bridges, such as the Tianhou Palace Bridge, Fujian Road Bridge, and Zhejiang Road Bridge, were open as usual, but barbed wire was placed at the ends of the bridges, and many Chinese and foreign detectives were stationed to guard them closely and conducted searches from time to time. Although the Wuzhen Road Bridge, Xin Zha Road Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, Inner Bailey Bridge, and Outer Bailey Bridge, which lead to Zhabei, were open as usual, the number of British and Japanese troops and detectives stationed there was increased compared to normal, and the situation was also very tense.

Iron Gates on Concession Roads Were All Closed

As for the various intersections of District A on the north bank of Suzhou Creek leading to Hongkou, since the Japanese army expanded to the western section of North Henan Road and set up posts and stationed troops, there have been no restrictions on residents entering and exiting there. All the iron gates on the various roads leading to the concession road were closed uniformly from yesterday morning. Tram route 18, which originally turned from North Xizang Road into Kaifeng Road and Haining Road to the end of North Henan Road, changed its route yesterday, turning from Beijing Road into Henan Road. Tram routes 5 and 17, which originally had the North Railway Station as their terminus, stopped at Haining Road yesterday due to the closure of the iron gates.

The Scene in Hongkou and Zhabei Was Desolate

In Hongkou and Yangshupu, the Japanese army's precautions were also very strict. Armed patrols patrolled the streets in groups of two. In the vicinity of the Wusong Wharf on Yangshupu Road, the garrison of the Nichiga troops was particularly forbidden for Chinese people to approach. In front of the Japanese shops, most of them had the Japanese flag displayed. The unarmed puppet police in Zhabei were also on guard at key intersections yesterday. However, because the general public was in a special environment, few went out, so the situation seemed even more desolate.

The Yuyuan Road Intersection Was Tense for a Time

At 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon, a puppet policeman shouldered a rifle and crossed into the intersection of Haig Road and Yuyuan Road, on the road in front of No. 28 Xinyuantai Fruit Shop, when it was noticed by the British defense forces stationed at the Yuyuan Road intersection. The British defense forces advised the puppet police to leave, but the puppet police ignored them and acted arrogantly, and even clashed with the British defense forces and made shooting gestures. The situation was very tense for a time. The Jing'an Temple Road Police Station was nearby and, upon hearing the news, immediately sent Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene to maintain order, and sent three armored vehicles to guard the area. The two sides confronted each other for about half an hour. The puppet police left sullenly after a senior officer from the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station came forward to explain.

Mutual Competition for Tax Cards

From 4:30 AM to 5:00 AM on the 5th of this month, and at dawn the day before yesterday (the 6th), dense machine gun fire and chaotic rifle fire were heard from western Shanghai, mixed with small cannon fire, which was loud and clear. The residents of the French Concession were puzzled and could not understand what was happening. In addition, the area outside the concession was occupied, so the truth could not be ascertained. According to information obtained from Pingming News Agency from a person from Longhua, it was actually a fire that broke out due to the "Peace Salvation Army" and the Japanese army competing for "tax cards." Zhang Huifang and the Japanese army clashed. Zhang's troops could not withstand the attack and withdrew. It is reported that both sides suffered heavy casualties this time.

### Japanese Commander Nishio Visits Shanghai: Yesterday at the International Hotel with an Entourage, Heavy Security Deployed on Jing'an Temple Road

Nishio Shuzo, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force, having just arrived in Shanghai from Jiangning the day before, yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, led over ten of his senior military officers, traveling in Nanjing Automobile Registration No. 1, Shanghai Defense Army Registration Nos. "452," "292," "303," "264," "209," and over a dozen other motorcycles, to Jing'an Temple Road.

They dined at the International Hotel. After Nishio and his entourage arrived, they proceeded to the 14th floor, dined with their staff, and inspected the facilities. They also displayed maps, with Nishio's staff pointing out and explaining features, gazing out the windows at the scenery. The New Gate Police Station had been notified in advance and deployed a large number of armed Chinese and Western detectives inside and outside the International Hotel to maintain security.

Several dozen American defense troops were also posted outside. Nishio and his party stayed for about an hour and a half, departing at 10:15 AM. They boarded their respective cars. The area around the International Hotel was temporarily closed to vehicles and pedestrians until Nishio and his entourage left. They were then escorted along Jing'an Temple Road westward towards Yidingpan Road, west of the American defense zone, towards Fanhuangdu, under heavy guard with two American military trucks No. "176" and "222" loaded with armed American defense troops, one in front and one behind the Japanese officers' cars. When Nishio's cars left the concession and arrived at

the roads beyond the concession on Jessfield Road and Fanhuangdu, large numbers of Japanese troops had been deployed there, with one Japanese soldier stationed every sixty steps on both sides, facing the pedestrian walkway in a standing guard. These troops were withdrawn at 10:45 AM after Nishio's cars had passed.

### Shanghai Under Military Control

Yesterday was the third anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction. The two concessions implemented unprecedented security measures. Troops from various countries, police detectives, and the International Volunteer Corps were all mobilized, placing the entire concession under military control. Fortunately, the day passed peacefully without incident.

### Japanese Military Police Arrested for Unauthorized Entry into American Defense Zone: Sixteen Disarmed, Released After Explanation of Misunderstanding

According to the English-language "Great American Evening Post," today (the 7th) is the third anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident. This morning, sixteen plainclothes armed Japanese military police entered the American Marine Corps defense zone without permission, leading to

their arrest by American soldiers.

They were taken to the American Marine Corps headquarters. American military authorities lodged a strong protest with the Japanese military, demanding a written apology from the Japanese side. The fact that armed Japanese personnel entered the American defense zone in plainclothes today violates the long-standing agreement between the commanders of the various countries' garrison forces in the Public Concession. However, the Japanese Embassy this morning

broadcasted a statement

strongly refuting this, claiming that the Japanese military police were merely taking "routine measures" to protect General Nishio Shuzo, who was attending a banquet at the International Hotel this morning, and "negligently" failed to consider the agreement. This morning, most of the plainclothes Japanese military police were arrested by American soldiers in the Jing'an Temple Road area. They were

loitering

with bulges at their waists and hips, attracting the attention of American soldiers. Four plainclothes Japanese military police in a truck at the Jing'an Temple Road intersection were also arrested, taken into American Marine Corps patrol cars and driven away. It is reported that the arrested Japanese did not resist.

This newspaper learned last night that the sixteen arrested plainclothes Japanese military police were released to the Japanese side at the Waibaidu Bridge at around 5:00 PM after the misunderstanding was explained.

### Rice Price Evaluation: First Meeting Tomorrow

The Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee officially began its work today and stipulated that, in addition to dispatching personnel weekly to investigate warehouse stocks for evaluation purposes, it would hold meetings twice a week. The evaluation would take place on the 2nd and 5th days, and the announcement would be made on the 3rd and 6th days. The committee's first evaluation meeting is scheduled for 3:00 PM tomorrow at the meeting place at No. 15 Avenue Edward VII. At that time, it will assess the highest prices based on the actual situation of rice arrivals, sales, and production costs, but for the time being, only foreign rice will be considered.

### Jiangpu Bureau Announces Truth About River Dredging

The Shanghai Jiangpu Bureau has issued a solemn denial regarding the claim that large-scale dredging of the Huangpu River has begun. It has also stated that the high tides in July have already been measured and attention has been directed to them. The following is a record from the Datong News Agency reporter:

Dredging Vessels

The bureau solemnly denies the rumor that its dredging vessel "Jianshe" has been repaired and completed, that the "Fuxing" has set sail from Germany for Shanghai, and that large-scale dredging of the Huangpu River will begin in July. As far as the bureau knows, the "Jianshe" is still moored in the heart of the river off the French Concession Bund for repairs and has not moved an inch. Although the "Fuxing" was completed in Germany some time ago, it has not been able to set sail for Shanghai due to domestic war issues and now due to the European war. Therefore, the dissemination of the above news is highly strange.

Dredging Scale

Regarding the dredging of the Huangpu River, the bureau is currently dredging the two sections below Chenjiazhui and Lujiazui. The dredging of the section below Lujiazui has already been completed, but the projects are all very small, far less than one-tenth of what they were before the war. This is because the bureau currently only has a few dredging vessels available, such as "Hai Xiang" and "Hai Bao," not the full fleet of dredging vessels that could be deployed before the war. Therefore, the rumor that large-scale dredging would begin in July is not accurate.

High Tide Quantities

The bureau's Water Conservancy Department has already measured the quantity of high tides during the flood season in July. The records are as follows: July 7, 11 feet 4 inches; July 8, 11 feet 2.5 inches; July 9, 11 feet 0.5 inches; July 10, 10 feet 8 inches; July 11 to 17, tides stable; July 18, trending high from midnight, 10 feet 9.5 inches; July 20, 11 feet 6.3 inches; July 21, 11 feet 5.2 inches; July 22, 11 feet 2.5 inches; July 23, 10 feet 7 inches.

### Difficulties Encountered in Exporting Shanghai Goods: Southern Sales Hindered by Transportation, Northern Shipments Restricted

Goods and textiles from various national product factories in this port, destined for Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan and other places, used to transit through Hong Kong and then through Mazhang, or via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Since the transportation on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway has become difficult, and recently Hong Kong has been experiencing difficulties in freight transport due to the tense situation between Britain and Japan, the export trade of various national product manufacturers in this city has gradually decreased. This is because Mazhang is adjacent to Longshan, where the Japanese army has been quite active recently, and there have been actions of aggression in that area. Various merchants and factories are unwilling to risk such a great danger. Therefore, the goods shipped from this port to the above-mentioned places in recent times have mostly changed routes, but transportation is quite difficult. Because there is no construction of highways and railways, transportation relies entirely on waterways, and the dates will inevitably be delayed. Therefore, the Shanghai goods in various inland areas cannot meet the demand, especially textiles, while this port has ample stocks and cannot export them. As for North China, since the implementation of controlled import trade to reduce the pressure on "Lianhe Bank Notes," goods imported into North China from third countries and Central and Southern China, with the exception of food, must have a "Letter of Approval" from the "Preparation Bank" or a "Permit" from the "Customs Supervisor." Therefore, this port's exports to North China, except for rice and flour, will be greatly affected in the future. The main commodities most affected are cigarettes, textiles, silk, tea, and cosmetics.

### Coal Briquettes Already Falling in Price and Being Sold Off: Reduced Costs, Sluggish Sales

The selling price of coal briquettes from various factories was previously set by the industry association to agree on standard market prices. Regardless of factory wholesale or retail, transactions must not exceed the limit. For a time, each factory still complied with the retail price of eight yuan per dan. Yesterday, a certain factory lowered the price of its inventory, stating that the manufacturing cost seemed to have been reduced. For a time, the market saw a sudden drop in prices. Although the factory wholesale price was still shouted at 148 yuan, the actual price had opened at 140 yuan. Therefore, the selling prices at various retail stores also varied quite a bit, calculated at 7 yuan 6 jiao, 7 yuan 4 jiao, 7 yuan 2-3 jiao, etc. It has been learned that there is no increase in the amount of spot goods on the market now. In addition, due to the approaching of muggy heat, sales of coal briquettes from various coal briquette factories have been sluggish, so they have reduced production. In short, the current manufacturing cost of coal briquettes has clearly been reduced, so it seems that reducing the selling price cannot be delayed.

### After Hong Kong-Vietnam Transportation is Suppressed: The Importance of the Burma Road is Becoming the Only International Transportation Line in South China, the Japanese Side Pays Special Attention to News from Burma, and the British Authorities in Hong Kong are Massively Stockpiling Grain

Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Burma are the only international transportation lines for China after the war. All exports of local products and imports of necessities are important places for entry and exit from all three places, especially Hong Kong. Although Japan has requested Britain and France to attempt a blockade, except for the temporary suspension of freight transport in Vietnam, Hong Kong and Burma are still unobstructed. However, Burma in the future will become the only international transportation line in southern China, because the Burma Road has been completed and the Burma Railway is about to open. Hong Kong is surrounded by Japan and its trade with China will inevitably be affected.

Trade Overview

It is reported that the Chinese government will change the controlled export of bristles, tung oil, tea, and minerals to be transported from Burma to Europe and the United States via the Burma Road. The following is a record of trade between Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Burma with China from January to May this year: Hong Kong imported 31,386,000 yuan, exported 177,543,000 yuan; Vietnam imported 64,378,000 yuan, exported 26,700,000 yuan; Burma imported 5,270,000 yuan, exported 8,282,000 yuan.

Recent Situation in Hong Kong Defense

Freight transportation between Shanghai and Haiphong has always been very prosperous. Since the French authorities in Vietnam accepted the Japanese request to ban the transport of military supplies into China on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and sent personnel to monitor within Vietnam, the situation in Haiphong has recently been of great concern to all parties. According to a Píngmíng Shè reporter who recently met with a reliable Mr. Laike who came to Shanghai via Hong Kong from Haiphong to inquire about the recent situation, it was said that he came to Shanghai from Haiphong on the first of this month. At that time, all Chinese

freight transportation businesses had already been completely shut down, and all Chinese transportation agencies set up in various places such as Haiphong and Hanoi in Vietnam had also withdrawn. Although many of the goods accumulated in them came from the United States, the responsibility still rested with the U.S. side until they were transported to China. Therefore, this measure by the Vietnamese French authorities not only violates the Sino-French agreement, but also deliberately disregards the rights and interests of third countries. Moreover, the "inspectors" sent by the Japanese side are mostly Japanese naval and army personnel, and it is clearly visible that they have military characteristics. Then, how Vietnam will evolve in the future is extremely disturbing. This not only threatens the southwestern provinces of China, but also has a serious impact on the position of Britain and the United States in

the Far East due to the actions between France and Japan. He had personally witnessed French personnel and Japanese personnel riding motorcycles together and parading through the streets, speeding back and forth. Looking at their actions, they even exceeded the "agreement" known to the world. In addition to monitoring freight transport, Chinese passing through Vietnam were subjected to unprecedented strict searches. All documents, books, and even private letters were often confiscated for no reason. Because the Vietnamese French authorities treated the Chinese so disregardfully, the general trend was for the Chinese to leave Vietnam in increasing numbers. When I took the steamer to Hong Kong, I was again

stopped by Japanese warships from berthing, and Japanese sailors searched the ship. As for the situation in Hong Kong, it is still extremely tense. The work of evacuating women and children is extremely active. However, most of the Chinese took steamers to Shanghai, so the voyage from Hong Kong to Shanghai was extremely crowded. However, one thing that can comfort the people of Shanghai is that the British authorities in Hong Kong have indeed prepared to resist the aggressors, and the strength of Hong Kong is also very sufficient. Although food has always had to be obtained from outside ports, it is now reported that there are large stockpiles, enough to meet the needs of a very long period in an emergency.

Japanese Side Attaches Importance

The Zìlín Xībào reported from Tokyo on July 6th, that Japanese radio stations are broadcasting news about the South Pacific Islands and South China to the whole country every day, which proves that Japan is paying close attention to these two places. Last night, Japanese sources claimed that the British war supplies and supplies transported to Chongqing via Hong Kong and Burma have doubled in the past, and newspapers are now publishing articles in prominent positions about the economic resources and political status of Burma and Vietnam, as well as the characteristics of the local people.

During the advanced study period, the school, research institution, or business unit will designate personnel to be responsible for guiding the advanced studies. After passing the assessment, the advanced study situation will be reported to the Ministry, and a certificate of achievement will be given. 9. The duration of advanced study is set at six months.

An affiliated women's supplementary school is set up, with general courses divided into senior, intermediate, and junior levels. Vocational courses include sewing, embroidery, typing, shorthand, accounting, and piano classes. More than 300 people have registered for this summer supplementary school, and classes will begin today.

Puyi Obligatory School. Puyi Obligatory School only accepts poor and out-of-school boys and girls who are willing to study sincerely. They are divided into three classes: A, B, and C. Whether they have studied or not, they can be inserted according to their level. The number of students is limited to 40. Classes are held from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM every night. Registration is from today until July 13th. All books and supplies are at their own expense. The school is located at No. 11, Guanhua Lane, Lafayte Road (West of Caishi Road).

Xinmin Middle School. Xinmin Middle School, located at No. 30, Wangjiasha Garden Road, Kade Road, Jing'an Temple Road, was located in Lao Jiangwan before the war. The school grounds and buildings were among the largest in Shanghai. Since August 13th, it has moved into the concession. Due to limited school buildings, there are only six classrooms, so only three senior high school and three junior high school levels are offered. The teaching is serious, and the management is strict. There are more than 200 students. This summer, new students in the first grade of senior and junior high school and transfer students in the second and third grades will be recruited. Registration starts today, and the examination will be on July 15th. The school also runs a summer school, which is scheduled to start on July 8th.

Yiyou Summer School. Yiyou Summer School is organized by alumni of Jiaotong University and the Municipal Council Middle School. Its purpose is to enable students of the alma mater to use their summer vacation to prepare for further studies or transfers. Those who go to register are extremely enthusiastic. It is recently learned that the school has also organized senior high school classes, junior high school classes, and graduation classes at the request of the students to make up for the differences in the systems of each alma mater. The quota for each subject is tentatively set at 30. The school is located at Dongnan Women's Physical Education School, No. 20 Wangjiasha Garden Road, Aiwenyi Road.

Zhibuzu Supplementary School. The school was founded by Li Jian and Zhang Pengfei, who compiled and printed loose-leaf supplementary materials for arithmetic and review textbooks to supplement the deficiencies of the current textbooks and correct the errors inherited over the years. They have endured hardships and sacrificed greatly. Whether they are students at school or young people in employment, they come with sincerity and leave with satisfaction. The school has now moved to No. 29, Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road. There are famous Shanghai school teachers and experts in various subjects, Liu Suisheng, Ding Jiming, Shen Shoubi, and Zhang Yisu.

Sumin Vocational School. Sumin Vocational School, located in the Siming Bank Building, Wufu Lane, Nanjing Road, this city, has a long history and excellent results. The school originally offered junior civil engineering and commercial courses. Starting this spring, it was approved by the Ministry of Education to add senior levels to the original two courses. Everything has been planned, and enrollment will begin immediately. The first examination will be held on the 14th of this month at the first school address on Nanjing Road. Sumin Middle School will also simultaneously recruit new students for the first grade of senior and junior high school and transfer students in each grade.

Jiangxi Middle School. Since Wu Shulin took over Jiangxi Middle School on Shandong Road, the management and teaching aspects have been very serious. Recently, in order to rectify the school spirit, all senior and junior high school students will be screened to eliminate them. Also, due to the poor school environment, the foreign-style house at No. 1609, Aiwenyi Road, has been rented for the next semester as a temporary school building. On the one hand, the education undertaking committee organized by the Jiangxi people in Shanghai is raising debts to build a school building. A base at No. 667, Pushi Road, has been rented, and Zhonghe Bank is designing and constructing it, which is expected to be completed by the end of October and moved into immediately.

### Hezhong Cup Basketball Tournament: Qifan Suffers a Crushing Defeat to Liangxi; Qifan Left With Only Three Players Due to Fouls; Liangxi Triumphs With 70 Against 40

In yesterday's sixth act of the Hezhong Cup Charity Basketball Tournament, in the first match of the Class A Industrial Group, the main players of Zhongyi, Hu Guocheng and his brother Guoding, were not seen on the court, greatly weakening their strength. However, they showed great enthusiasm at first and shot accurately. Tongren worked hard to follow, with Zhongyi leading by five points, 19 to 14, in the first half. After the change of ends, Tongren's Xuan Tongxuan and Jiang Shuliang cooperated closely and tacitly, increasing their scores and catching up later. As a result, Zhongyi fell behind 31 to 39, and Tongren reversed the defeat into victory.

Qifan Loses to Liangxi

The next game was between Qifan and Liangxi of the Class A First Group. Qifan's main players, Xu Jusheng, Kong Guangyi, Dong Yangfeng, and Wang Xingen, were absent yesterday due to various reasons, greatly reducing their strength. However, with the determination to break the cauldrons and sink the boats, they fought against the odds, and their morale was extremely high. They made frequent contributions. In the first ten minutes, Qifan's performance was quite remarkable. Qian Jingyong and Zhang Xianlun repeatedly broke through Liangxi's basket and led for a long time. Later, Liangxi's Liang Yunming scored three pointers, and Zhang Liangxiong and Zhuo Guoxiong frequently made free throws. When the first half ended, Liangxi took the lead with 35 to 23. In the second half, Liangxi's Zhang Liangxiong suddenly became enthusiastic, and the score increased sharply. Qifan's Qu Xilin was closely watched by Liangxi and could not move. Before long, Zhang Xianlun was fouled out for the fourth time and replaced by Jin Changchun, who scored two goals. However, when it was 32 to 48, Qu Xilin was also fouled out. Due to the lack of fresh troops, there was no substitute. They fought with only four people. When it was 40 to 55, Qu Xilong was also fouled out. Only three players were left on Qifan's front line, and the disparity in numbers was too great. Therefore, in the last four minutes, Liangxi entered the no-man's land and won with 70 to 40.

### Market Knowledge Consultant

Mr. Huang Daozhang asks:

(1) Your newspaper published in the commercial news column on May 25 that the Central Bank's listed silver tax is 15.00%. Calculated based on the British gold standard of one shilling and two and a half pence, what is the meaning of the silver equalization tax and the levy of 15.00%?

(2) On the same day, the customs gold equivalent to British gold was listed as thirty-nine pence and five, and equivalent to US $0.521875. What formula is used to convert this?

(3) Is the price of British pure gold at eight pounds and eight shillings per ounce fixed and不变?

——Please have the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute answer

(1) The silver equalization tax was originally established because the silver dollar in China had a higher value than legal tender, to prevent Chinese silver dollars from flowing out. The equalization tax rate is calculated based on the British gold standard of one shilling and two and a half pence compared to the previous day's London silver price. If the silver content of each silver dollar is higher than one shilling and two and a half pence, then the excess amount will be taxed, and 15.00% is this tax rate.

(2) Regarding the conversion to British gold, it is calculated based on one yuan being equivalent to one shilling and two and a half pence. The Central Bank's listed customs gold is equivalent to 2.707 yuan in legal tender, and the exchange rate of one yuan of legal tender to British currency is fourteen and a half pence. Therefore (2.707 x 14.5 = 39.25), each unit of customs gold is thirty-nine pence and twenty-five. As for the value against the US dollar, it is calculated based on the previous day's New York closing exchange rate, which is $0.521875.

(3) The official exchange rate of the British pound is $4.02 against the US dollar, and the US also has an official gold price of $35 per ounce and is making every effort to purchase domestic and foreign gold to maintain this price. Therefore, the price of London British pure gold at eight pounds and eight shillings per ounce has not changed.

Mr. Sun Xiannan asks:

I read the financial weekly, volume 9, issue 18, regarding the equalization tax table on April 23:

British exchange parity 17.3522, Shanghai opening British exchange price 4.125, difference 13.2272, theoretical equalization tax 312.91, equalization tax (percentage) 12.00, difference 300.91

(1) What calculations are the basis for the above three numbers: theoretical equalization tax 312.91, equalization tax 12.00, difference 300.91?

(2) What is the principle behind our country's levying of equalization tax?

(3) Why does the equalization tax for Monday in that issue only have the Shanghai opening British exchange price of 4.1250 and the equalization tax of 9.75, and no other records?

Please have the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute answer

(1) The theoretical equalization tax is calculated based on the black market exchange rate. Due to the decline in the exchange rate, the equalization tax should be 312.91%. However, if calculated with each yuan equal to one shilling and two pence, then only 15.00% is taxed. The difference between the two is 300.91. If the equalization tax is calculated with each yuan equal to one shilling and two and a half pence, then the formula is as follows:

London silver price x 0.8165744 (pure silver content per yuan)

(1) 14.5 (one shilling and two pence) +

(London silver price x 0.8165744)

(2) Regarding the principle of equalization tax, please refer to the answer to Mr. Huang Daozhang's question.

(3) The London silver price market closes every Saturday, so there is no British exchange parity on Sunday.

Mr. Shen Chengzhao asks:

(1) What is import usance? How does the A/P method work?

(2) How are forward foreign exchange rates generated?

Please have the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute answer

(1) Import usance is a business where the bank provides financing to the importer and handles foreign payments on their behalf. There are usually two methods:

1. The bank, at the request of the importer, accepts the bill of exchange issued by the foreign exporter. The method is first for the importer to request a commercial letter of credit (referred to as a "credit letter") from their bank and send it to the exporter. The latter then issues a bill to the issuing bank based on this credit letter. The addressee of the credit letter is the exporter, stating that within the specified amount, the recipient may issue a bill to the issuing bank, which will be accepted or paid by the latter. The exporter then discounts the bill along with various shipping documents such as the shipping bill of lading, insurance policy, and invoice with their bank (this is one of the export usance methods). Then, the exporter's bank sends the bill and documents to the importer's bank for acceptance. After the latter accepts the bill, they return the bill and keep the shipping documents, notifying the importer to prepare funds to collect the shipping documents, or the importer can obtain the documents by issuing a trust receipt to the bank. However, the bill must be paid in full before it matures. After the bill is accepted by the bank, it is repeatedly discounted in the bill market. When the bill matures, the holder can present it to the accepting bank for redemption. The latter can redeem it because they have received the payment from the importer. In this transaction, the exporter has already received cash on the date of shipment, and the importer can pay after the goods arrive or request the bank to extend the payment within the maturity period (such as using a trust receipt). The party responsible for the advance payment is neither the exporter's bank nor the importer's bank. The former can discount the bill in the market after it is accepted when the bill and its documents are sent to the foreign correspondent bank, turning it into a deposit in its correspondent bank. The latter only assumes the responsibility of acceptance and does not actually make an advance payment. The real lender is the investor who purchases the bill. Because our country does not have a bill discount market and the credit of various banks has no international standing, our banks do not issue credit letters.

2. The bank, at the request of the importer, entrusts its foreign correspondent bank to purchase the bill issued by the exporter. Most of our country's import usance uses this method. This method first requires the importer to request a "purchase authorization" (A/P) from their bank. The content is also in the form of a letter, which is sent from the issuing bank to its correspondent bank. After the latter receives the letter, it notifies the exporter to issue a bill (the acceptor and payer of this bill is the importer) and sells it to the bank along with the shipping documents. The bank then makes a payment from the issuing bank's current account and sends the bill and shipping documents to the entrusting bank. After the latter receives the bill and shipping documents, it notifies the importer to prepare funds to take them. This bill cannot be repeatedly discounted because it is not a bank-accepted bill.

(2) Forward foreign exchange, also known as foreign exchange futures, had trading in foreign currency futures in Vienna and Berlin in the 19th century. Later, foreign exchange markets in countries with unstable currencies often had forward contracts. In our country, during the silver standard era, the foreign exchange futures market had already emerged because the exchange rate fluctuated. This is because import and export trade has a high exchange rate risk when the currency is unstable. Importers need to pre-purchase foreign exchange to determine their purchase costs, and exporters need to pre-sell foreign exchange to determine their income. The former is seeking and the latter is supplying, which can be exchanged with each other. There are also foreign exchange speculators who buy and sell short, which constitutes today's foreign exchange futures market.

Mr. Ma Guoliang asks:

What is exchange dumping?

Please have the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute answer

Devaluing the currency or using other methods to lower the foreign exchange rate will inevitably lower the price of domestic exports when calculated in foreign currency, allowing them to be sold cheaply in foreign markets. After Britain abandoned the gold standard in 1931, the pound price plummeted, and gold standard countries followed suit, competing for foreign markets by devaluing their currencies. At that time, it was called a currency war, and the name "exchange dumping" also arose from this.

Mr. You Jian asks:

(1) After the abolition of the tael standard, is it still applicable to calculate the Shanghai-British fixed number using H.O. White's linked calculation method when calculating the London telegraphic transfer parity? How should it be calculated? Please provide an example.

(2) Based on the Shanghai Daily market price list, the HSBC listed British exchange rate and the British-US exchange rate in the overseas countries' exchange rate column, the calculated US exchange rate differs by one US dollar from the reported US exchange rate. What is the reason for this? Or is the calculation wrong? Can you give a specific example?

(3) Why are the British-US and US-British exchange rates different in the overseas countries' exchange rate column?

(4) On the 11th, in the financial news section of the Shanghai Daily's commercial news column, there is a sentence in the foreign exchange section: "Final shilling, three pence, four three seven five, US dollar, four yuan, six two five," but the market price list on that day lists the US exchange rate as 4.3125 yuan, and the British exchange rate is only three pence, which is quite different. What is the source of the market price list?

Please have the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute answer

(1) From the abolition of the tael system to the implementation of the legal tender policy, the external price was expressed in silver standard currency. The linked calculation method is still used to calculate the London telegraphic transfer parity. The calculation method is as follows:

? Pence = one yuan in silver standard currency

One silver coin = 23.4934483 grams of pure silver

31.10351 grams = 1 ounce

.925 ounces of pure silver = London market price of standard silver per ounce (i.e., the reported market price of silver bars)

.8165744 x London market price of standard silver per ounce = British exchange parity

If the market price of silver bars is 21 pence, then the British exchange parity should be:

.8165744 x 21 = 71.1479624 pence (i.e., the number of pence equivalent to one silver coin)

(2) The British-US exchange rate of 4.025 yuan in the overseas countries' exchange rate is the official exchange rate after the British unified foreign exchange. Those who want to do arbitrage cannot use this rate to exchange US dollars for shillings. The actual value of shillings must be based on the New York exchange market, that is, the US-British exchange rate in the overseas countries' exchange rate column. Those who want to do arbitrage can only exchange US dollars for shillings according to the US-British arbitrage rate. Therefore, the HSBC listed British exchange rate and US exchange rate should be adjusted based on the US-British arbitrage rate. Here is an example of the HSBC listed exchange rate and overseas countries' exchange rate on April 20, as reported in the Shanghai Daily commercial news. On that day, the British exchange rate was reported as four pence, the US exchange rate was 5.75 yuan, the British-US exchange rate in overseas countries was 4.025 yuan, and the US-British exchange rate was 3.515 yuan. Calculated based on the British-US exchange rate, the Shanghai US exchange rate should be: 6.607833 yuan. The calculation method is as follows: (to be continued)

### Finance: A Review of the Foreign Exchange Market in the Past Week

According to the report of the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute, the foreign exchange market in the past week continued the trend of the previous week and remained in a hovering state. Excluding the bank settlement holiday on Monday and Tuesday, there were only four actual trading days. The highest US exchange rate was 6.34375 yuan, and the lowest was 6.0625 yuan. The highest British exchange rate was 4.03125 pence, and the lowest was 3.8125 pence. The factors causing fluctuations are said to be the following: (1) Song Ziwen's negotiations in the United States, (2) the tense situation in Hong Kong, and (3) the sale of gold from North China in Shanghai for arbitrage. Song has been in the United States for nearly two weeks, and although there have been reports of frequent contacts, the content is still unclear. Since the incident, the United States has twice publicly loaned money to China, once in December of the 27th year for 25 million yuan, and the second time in March of this year for 20 million yuan. With Song's reputation, going to the United States himself should not be difficult to obtain a loan. As for the form of the loan, it is still difficult to speculate. The recent contacts between Song and the Export-Import Bank may give a glimpse of the situation. However, Song has always advocated a sound financial policy and has had extraordinary ambitions in peacetime. The goal of this trip may have other important missions in addition to economic ones. Furthermore, it is unknown whether this loan will provoke stimulation from other parties, leading the government to strengthen the management of the foreign exchange market. The European situation is complex, and the Hong Kong situation is particularly tense. Traffic routes are gradually becoming a problem, and the demand for foreign exchange should decrease. However, it remains to be seen whether the situation in Shanghai can be stabilized as the Hong Kong situation deteriorates and how it will affect the market. Moreover, with the tension between Britain and Japan and the difficult relationship between the United States and Japan, those who are "escaping capital" have a sense of where the promised land is. Therefore, the market is hovering, and the trading volume is becoming increasingly small. This week, due to the gold dumping, the foreign exchange rate fluctuated accordingly. The reason for the sharp decline in gold is that the difference between the gold prices in North China and Shanghai is huge. The recent gold price in North China is about 4,600 yuan, while the Shanghai market is still above the high price of 5,000 yuan. Adding the premium between Tianjin and Shanghai, the profit from arbitrage is very high. Moreover, the legal gold price in Guanshan is only 2,200 yuan. If there is any arbitrary increase in prices or free trading, not only will it be confiscated, but there may even be criminal penalties. Those with gold in North China are deeply afraid that Tianjin will follow its example and want to sell as soon as possible. As a result, the gold price in Shanghai is falling. There is a link between exchange rates and gold prices. As the gold price falls, it will inevitably affect the foreign exchange market. In the past, merchants in North China hoarded too much merchandise, and prices have recently plummeted, causing serious damage and forcing them to sell gold to make up for the losses, resulting in the current phenomenon in the foreign exchange market. In addition, there is often a large supply of Japanese gold notes in the market, and prices are falling. In order to maintain the situation, the other party sells foreign exchange, which is another reason for the long position in the foreign exchange market. Although the foreign exchange rate rose slightly on Saturday due to the small US exchange rate report, the floor was very hard, and long positions were gradually released, eventually closing at the loosest price of the week.

### Financial Commentary, Ending July 6 (Continued)

— Sheng Kaiqiong

Negotiating another large credit loan with the United States to purchase metals, gasoline, automobiles, machinery, and other raw materials needed for construction, in order to complete a self-sufficient anti-Japanese economic policy, should be an essential endeavor. This is Song's second financial mission. —After the establishment of the second credit loan, China tried to borrow another 55 million yuan from the United States (see the Associated Press report on March 9 of this year).

However, what is involved here is more than just financial issues.

(3) Foreign Exchange, Gold, and Stocks

Because there were two days of bank semi-annual settlement holidays, there were only four days of activity in the financial market. According to the statistics for these four days, the market prices of foreign exchange and gold, regardless of opening or closing, high or low, can be said to be a completely upward trend. The fluctuation of the British exchange rate was 0.203125 pence, the fluctuation of the US exchange rate was 0.3125 cents, and the range of gold price fluctuations was 465 yuan. The stock market remained flat and sluggish.

The reason for the loosening trend in the foreign exchange market, in addition to the fact that the market was stiff on the 5th due to the excessive fall in British exchange, was that the tense Far East situation in the environment made it difficult for operators to manage, and Song's activities in the United States made the bulls feel that defeat was of no benefit, and success would be rewarded. Therefore, in a situation of profit, the market tended to be long. At the same time, the basic factor affecting the foreign exchange market still fell to the US-British exchange rate in New York. According to statistics since June 6, after the US-British exchange rate rose, the degree of strengthening of the British exchange rate in this city was only about 3%, while the degree of improvement of the US exchange rate reached about 10%. Therefore, in the absence of fluctuations in the US-British exchange rate, the Shanghai foreign exchange market may develop normally.

Several people in the industrial and financial circles in Shanghai recently formed a "China Stock Company Limited" which started operating on July 3, specializing in buying and selling Chinese stocks on behalf of customers, acting as agents for companies to recruit shares, issuing company bonds on behalf of companies, and all business related to stocks. It is said that the company's funds are 50,000 yuan, and the operating method is as follows: (to be continued)

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Resumes Looseness

The sugar market trend turned loose yesterday. The association's negotiated price for spot goods was 67.6 to 67.4 yuan for coarse white in the main warehouse, and 53.4 to 53.3 yuan for transshipment goods with a ten-day warehouse receipt, and 53.8 yuan for those with a twenty-day warehouse receipt. The rest had little transaction. The state sugar fixed price was not opened, and the closing price did not rise or fall.

### Seafood: Siamese Small Dried Mussels Continue to Decline Slightly, Eleven Yuan Lower Than Before

Siamese small dried mussels, which had opened at 150 yuan in the previous market, were approximately sluggish and stagnant. The market situation was quite weak, and the sales price saw a continuous decline. The current transaction price is 139 yuan, which is eleven yuan lower than the previous market.

### Coal: Charcoal Prices Relax After Peak

The charcoal market, which had seen Grade A charcoal reach a high of eleven yuan per dan (unit of weight) last month due to supply disruptions from Wenzhou, has seen a resurgence in supply with the resumption of shipping routes from Wenzhou and Taizhou. Prices have gradually weakened. Current wholesale prices are: Wenzhou Grade A charcoal at nine yuan and fifty cents per dan, Haimen flat cap charcoal at six yuan and seventy cents, and Huangyan charcoal at five yuan and eighty cents. Delivery charges are extra.

### Re-transcribing Old News: Sixty-Seven Years Ago (438) (From the Shenbao of the Twelfth Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Late Qing Dynasty)

The Military Examinations (2)

The military examination system was a new practice of the Ming dynasty, which the current dynasty continues. Before the Yuan dynasty, it did not exist. The Ming dynasty established military examinations because it valued them. The generals and officers of various garrisons mostly came from formal paths of advancement, standing alongside those who rose through the ranks. Furthermore, those who rose through the ranks only received promotions based on their merits in battle, while those who passed the military examinations advanced according to their qualifications, giving them an advantage over those who rose through the ranks. In the current dynasty, the Manchu banner system is used, which is integrated with the Green Standard Army. As a result, military positions are primarily held by those from the banner system, while those who came through formal paths of advancement are given less importance. Therefore, although the system is inherited from the Ming dynasty, its intent is vastly different. I believe that even in the late Ming dynasty, what was practiced was used, and what was used was valued. Although it was ruined by civil officials, the military officials cannot be entirely absolved of the blame for losing battles and territory. Therefore, why should we hesitate to abolish the Ming dynasty's system? Some argue that in recent years, there is a growing emphasis on Western firearms. In addition to archery, horsemanship, swords, and stone throwing, it would be appropriate to also test on Western rifles, so that military officers who came through formal paths of advancement would not be inferior to those who rose through the ranks in terms of skills. Furthermore, the deficiencies in assigning official duties would be addressed. Sailors in the naval forces along the coast should also be allowed to participate in the examinations. By assessing their strengths, those skilled in firearms and naval warfare could also rise through the examination system. Additionally, military students in schools could also become proficient in firearms. By combining the paths of advancement for naval forces, army, and military students, the imbalance in importance can be avoided. This proposal is better than the proposal made by Governor-General Shen of Liangjiang last year to abolish the military examinations.

Food, Clothing, Housing and Transportation

### A Rhyme on the Four Essentials of Life: Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

— Sun Choucheng

Since the outbreak of war, people from various places who have some economic means have flocked to Shanghai to take refuge. As a result, housing prices have increased daily, making it very difficult. In recent years, due to various reasons, the prices of all goods have risen sharply. None of the four essential elements of life have been spared. Mr. Qian Shiqing is a thoughtful person. After retiring from his political career, he has been living in Shanghai, writing poetry and drinking wine to pass the time. Yesterday, he came to visit and showed me a recent poem he wrote on the four essentials of life, clothing, food, housing, and transportation. The language is elegant and insightful. It not only vividly depicts the current state of the isolated island but also contains advice to be frugal. I have recorded it in this publication for the enjoyment of fellow enthusiasts.

Since the flames of war have spread across the Central Plains, this isolated island has become a haven for those seeking refuge, like a Peach Blossom Spring. The population has surged, and land has become scarce. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation have all become difficult. Silk has traditionally been a product of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the cotton industry has also developed. However, many factories have now stopped production, making it difficult to find goods. In the past, silk cost five or six cents, but now it has risen to more than two yuan. A foot of cloth used to cost twelve or thirteen cents, but now it costs three times as much, and the quality has deteriorated. Since ancient times, people have regarded food as the most important thing. In prosperous times, a斗 (dǒu, a unit of dry measure) of rice was worth a hundred coins, but now a hundred gold coins can only buy two shi (石, another unit of dry measure). The coolies must work hard all year round. Hoarders accumulate goods and compete to be strange, storing them in thousands of warehouses. As a result, prices on the isolated island have skyrocketed, and the poor cannot even afford congee. Chewing on vegetable roots is considered frugal, but even that is hard to come by these days. Vegetable prices are so high that my purse is embarrassed. I want to gather薇 (wēi, a type of fern) on the side of Shouyang Mountain. I don't know the taste of meat. How can I enjoy a feast? Overeating is just a waste. Thinking of tasting a piece costs so much. Drilling wood to make fire is an ancient method that has disappeared. Coal briquettes are now widely used as fuel, but a lack of supply has driven up prices. We must learn from our ancestors to eat raw meat and drink blood. A place to sit and rest used to be easy to find, but on this small isolated island, it's hard to turn around. It's difficult to rent a dwelling, like Liang Hong's poverty. We should admire the birds that sing in the poems. Wang Ni had no house and slept in an exposed cart. Yuan Hong was willing to live in an earthen chamber. Where can we find a clean piece of land? Living in six places is barely enough. After being a high official, one shouldn't walk. Car prices are soaring, hindering travel. Walking is the best, so don't boast about owning a fancy carriage. Now I advise those who own property not to monopolize and seek profit. Letting go of profits will surely cause resentment. How about being generous and understanding the greater good? Now I also advise those who are temporarily residing here to be frugal with food, lodging, clothing, and footwear. Be content with poverty and wait quietly for the time to return home and complete the family home. You must know that this isolated island is not a paradise. It is difficult to live here for long like a swallow building a nest in a curtain or a fish in a cauldron. Moving to the mainland is easier to make a living, which is beneficial to both oneself and others.

### After Sweatshirts Become Expensive

— Zhao

It's getting hot, and it's time to wear undershirts again. But this year's price of undershirts is really scary. The most basic ones cost about two yuan each! The better looking ones cost three or four yuan. At this time, rice costs 60 or 70 yuan per shi (石, unit of dry measure), and daily necessities are several times more expensive. The heavy pressure of life is making everyone breathless, so everyone is trying to save money on expenses. So, with undershirts so expensive this year, what should we use to replace undershirts? Yes, let me introduce you!

We can go to the fabric store to buy white linen (all colors are available) to tailor small, short-sleeved shirts without collars, like undershirts. Linen can be said to be the cheapest and most beautiful fabric for summer clothing. Each foot costs about thirty cents. Six feet is enough for a small, short-sleeved shirt with two feet of hem. Whether you sew it yourself or have a tailor sew it for you, it won't cost much. In short, the money spent on a linen shirt is definitely more economical than the price of an undershirt, and the degree of comfort and coolness is no less than that of the best undershirt!

### Summer Hometown Delicacies

— Qiulang

I came to Shanghai to make a living and it has been more than ten years in a flash. But every summer, when "the days are as long as a small year," I always miss my hometown of Hangzhou, especially my hometown after the war. What has it become like? The beautiful mountains and clear waters of my hometown are of course always in my dreams, and the flavors of my hometown are also very famous. Although I can't taste them now, recalling that delicious taste makes me feel like Zhang Ji, who misses the water shield and perch. I often have saliva hanging from the corners of my mouth.

Wind-dried Meat: Wind-dried meat is a specialty of Hangzhou and a summer delicacy. Because it doesn't have the greasiness of fresh meat, it is richly fragrant, fatty, delicious but not greasy. It is most suitable for cooking with winter melon. It can be served with rice or as a side dish with wine, far superior to other dishes. Although Hangzhou's preserved meat shops all sell it, Wanlong Shop in Qinghefang is the most famous because the spices they use in the curing process are very accurate, so it is especially popular. Foreigners who go to Hangzhou must buy some to take back.

Double-inserted Melon: Double-inserted melon is also a specialty of Hangzhou. It is only available for a very short time. According to Hangzhou custom, each sauce garden opens its vats at the beginning of the first ten days of the hot season, and it is sold out after the middle ten days. Those that are sold again are called second-sweet melons. The most famous manufacturer of double-inserted melons should be Weihe Sauce Garden, followed by Hengtai and other gardens. The melon has a fresh, crisp, slightly sweet taste, which is very different from other pickled cucumbers. It is best served with porridge or added to soup and eaten with rice, which is light and refreshing. If you want to store it, just mix it with white sugar and dry it in the sun, so it can be stored for a long time and prepared for emergencies. People on isolated islands who want to taste these two delicacies can buy them from several stores that sell Hangzhou native products, but of course the prices are more expensive. Fortunately, Shanghai people are good at researching food. As long as they want to try something new, they will definitely not haggle over the small price.

### Living in Summer

— Meizi

Living in the summer is the most annoying because, except for the general wealthy class, most people live in spaces as cramped as birdcages. Generally, five or six families live in an ordinary house, or at least two or three. Some even rent out the loft, sun deck, and kitchen. This can be barely tolerated in the spring, autumn, and winter, but it is miserable in the summer. Not only is there no air circulation, but there is also not much space for ventilation. So, if you don't think of a way, the suffering will definitely be even more unbearable. Here are a few points that I have thought of that may be helpful:

(1) Cleanliness. Since the space is low and small, it is easy to clean. You must diligently sweep every day to ensure that not a trace of dust remains. After sweeping, pour some disinfectant to sterilize. Garbage must be dumped at any time. In this way, you can indirectly reduce the production of bedbugs and other things, and you will not feel like you "can't sit still" inside.

(2) Eliminate mosquitoes and flies. Food that easily attracts flies, such as rice dishes, must be covered with a gauze cover. Other items, such as sweets eaten by children, must also be placed separately in boxes or bottles. Do not put them on the table at will, to avoid cockroaches and flies. As for mosquitoes, they will be reduced after the room is cleaned.

(3) Don't be too greedy for coolness. After going to bed at night, you must at least cover your abdomen with a thin sheet. It is better to let yourself sweat from the heat. This can avoid the onset of diseases in the autumn, because these diseases are caused by being greedy for coolness in the summer.

(4) Bathing problem. Now hot water has risen to one cent per scoop, and the bathing fee is also quite considerable. Therefore, apart from having a big bath during the sweltering heat, you only need to wipe your upper and lower body at other times. Wiping away sweat is very cool, so you can save this hot water fee!

### "Hollowing Out the Yellow Croaker"

— Jinbi

There is a slang phrase popular among sailors: "Hollowing out the yellow croaker." What does "hollowing out the yellow croaker" mean? Outsiders are mostly baffled by them. It turns out that it is what they use to call those passengers who ride the white boat (i.e., without paying for a ticket).

Most of the people who "hollow out the yellow croaker" are country bumpkins and coolies. Some of them, of course, because it is not easy to earn money, would rather endure beatings and humiliation than pay for a boat ticket. (Most of these people are from Jiangbei.) But most of them are penniless and cannot survive in the city, and they lack travel expenses to return to their hometown. So they have no choice but to take the risk and disregard face. "Hollowing out the yellow croaker" is what they do.

Other people who "hollow out the yellow croaker" are much luckier. They have fellow villagers or relatives who are stewards, sailors, or cooks on the boat. They don't need to "hollow out the yellow croaker" in the first place, but they always want to save some money if they can. So they also take this route. But they are much more "relaxed" than the first type of "hollowers." They don't need to play hide-and-seek with the ticket inspectors. They can lie on the bunks of the stewards, sailors, or cooks without worry. When the ticket inspector passes by, they just temporarily cover their heads with a quilt and can get through.

Before the war, if the first type of "hollower" was discovered, the people on the boat mostly urged him to buy a ticket. But when he really couldn't come up with the money, they would at most threaten to strip off his clothes or pretend to tie him up with ropes. When they saw that they really couldn't squeeze any oil out of him, they would scold him a few times after being persuaded by others and let it go. As for the second type of "hollower," everyone was one of their own. Since there were acquaintances on the boat, they would let it go easily.

Now it's different. Before, almost half of the large and small boats that traveled on the Yangtze River and inland rivers were forcibly occupied by a certain party. They are very strict in their surveillance, and nothing can be accommodated. Even "hollowing out the yellow croaker," the first type cannot be let go as easily as before. On the contrary, they are often subjected to insults and beatings. A few days ago, on a steamboat that went to Beisha, a Jiangbei man who was "hollowing out the yellow croaker" was reportedly forced to jump into the Yangtze River and commit suicide. The second type of "hollower" can no longer be as carefree as before. It is said that a certain party has been cracking down recently. If this type of "hollower" is found on the boat, the steward, sailor, or cook who is related to him will also be suspended from business.

Alas! Even "hollowing out the yellow croaker" is not what it used to be.

### (35) Arrowhead and Taro Balls

— Drafted by Luo Feng

Ingredients: Eggs, Taro, Arrowhead, MSG, Spicy Soy Sauce, Sweet Sauce, Pure White Water Chestnut Flour, Oil, Salt

Preparation: First wash the taro, boil it until it is soft, and then mash it. Mix the mashed taro with eggs and pure white water chestnut flour. Then cut the arrowhead into small pieces, add an appropriate amount of MSG, salt, and sweet sauce, and mix together. Then take the mixed taro and make round ball shells, using the mixed arrowhead sauce as the ball filling, the smaller the better. After making the balls, fry them in a frying pan. When they are fried until they are yellow and firm, they should be taken out immediately. Serve with spicy soy sauce, which is most suitable. This dish is very nutritious.

### (36) Raw Mixed Sichuan Tofu

— Drafted by Pan Deji

(Sixth Summer Dish)

Ingredients: Soft tofu, Sichuan vegetables (i.e., pickled mustard tuber), soybean oil or raw oil, MSG, scallions, fine salt

Preparation: Remove the skin of the soft tofu. Cut the Sichuan vegetables and scallions into small pieces and place them in the tofu. Add an appropriate amount of MSG and fine salt, and stir slightly with chopsticks. Then heat the oil until it is cooked, pour it over the tofu, and mix well again. Eat it immediately. It is fresh, delicious, hygienic, and rich in vitamins.

If you want to buy "MSG" and oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar, please call "44194." A special delivery will be made immediately without a delivery charge. Pouring some sesame oil on it is also light and flavorful, and it can be served with rice like ham and winter melon soup.

### One Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Monday: Ham and winter melon soup, vinegared yellow croaker slices, snow vegetable braised tofu, sweet sauce braised eggplant

Tuesday: Onion and beef strips, dry-fried salted ribbonfish, green vegetables fried with bean curd sheets, dried shrimp mixed with dried tofu strips

Wednesday: Stir-fried pork strips with mushrooms, sweet and sour pomfret, mushroom and dried vegetable soup, stewed stinky tofu

Thursday: Vermicelli and beef slices, snow vegetable stewed cuttlefish, braised vegetarian ten-scene dish, chives mixed with tofu

Friday: Pork and tofu soup, cucumber stir-fried with small shrimp, braised cabbage, stir-fried long beans

Saturday: Sweet potato and beef soup, salted fish braised with tofu, vegetarian ten-scene casserole, snow vegetable and bean sprouts

Sunday: Meat stewed with eggs, fried yellow croaker, stir-fried spinach, steamed eggplant

The dishes we eat in summer, whether they are meat or vegetarian, should always be light and flavorful. Overly rich dishes are not suitable for summer. The most light and flavorful meat dish in summer is ham and winter melon soup. When you hear the word ham, you will definitely be startled, thinking that ham is something for the nobles. How can it be included in an economic menu? Although 70 ham is expensive, there are also economical ways to eat it. When you buy ham at the ham store, you don't have to buy the upper or middle part of the loin. Just buy the shoulder, which costs about one yuan. When you buy it back, you can cut a few slices at any time and make soup with winter melon. My family bought a shoulder and can use it four or five times. Although there are not many slices, the soup is still very flavorful. For vegetarian soup, use dried vegetables, mushrooms, and edamame.

### Stalin's Daily Life

— Maode

When it comes to the Soviet Union, everyone knows Stalin. He is the leader of the Communist Party and the central figure in Soviet politics. He is not only the leader of a country, but also the leader of international communists. However, since the great changes in the European war situation, the Soviet Union is also trying to expand its territory, so Stalin's every move is enough to make the world pay attention. Here I record some information about his daily life.

Stalin gets up before six o'clock every morning. After washing his face, he goes to the Kremlin garden for a walk for ten minutes. After returning, he opens and reads his private letters and newspapers, which takes about an hour to complete. At seven-thirty, he has a light breakfast, two pieces of bread, a cup of tea. At eight o'clock, he takes a car to Sfolanla, the office of the Central Committee. His office is a narrow and sparsely furnished small room. He sits at a half-new desk, listening to the reports of his subordinates. He always maintains a silent attitude and does not speak rashly unless he has waited for the other party to finish speaking and completely understands the true meaning of what they said. Then he makes his judgment. From nine o'clock, he officially starts working, and does not have lunch until two o'clock in the afternoon. In an emergency, the time is even longer. At lunch, he puts his pipe next to him and smokes while waiting for the dishes to be served. The dishes are very simple, but he likes to drink alcohol, likes meat, soup, or gravy, and finally eats some bread. After the meal, he takes advantage of the two or thirty minutes of free time to walk in front of the corridor.

At three o'clock, he continues to work. He usually finishes around ten o'clock, and goes home for dinner. Sometimes, if he does not finish his work for the day, he will not leave the office. If necessary, he even sleeps in his office and does not go home. He once said: "Work is my life." This shows how loyal he is to service, but his enjoyment in daily life can be said to be extremely simple and civilianized.

In short, Stalin works very hard for eleven hours a day, and spends the rest of his time reading, playing chess, thinking, and writing. Sometimes he goes to the opera house to listen to opera, or to the cinema to watch movies. Therefore, his bedtime is always after one o'clock in the middle of the night, and he sleeps only five hours on average per day. However, his physique can still be compared to heavy granite.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

— Editor

After this publication published two articles on the YMCA subsidizing poor students, yesterday we received an article from Mr. Mei Ji on "Encroaching on Poor Student Scholarships," and Mr. Liu also sent a report (both published later). This is naturally a noteworthy fact.

Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. The establishment of poor student scholarships seems to have all advantages and no disadvantages, but the articles published below clearly tell us that disadvantages have unfortunately also occurred.

To eliminate these disadvantages, I agree with the two points mentioned by Mr. Mei Ji. Because the parties involved are only schools (institutions) and students, eliminating these disadvantages is naturally the joint responsibility of both parties.

If you are a student with a comfortable family economic situation, in all respects, you should not fill the only way for those who are poor and unable to go to school. On the contrary, you should also subsidize them to make up for the lack of school or institutional scholarships. As for wasting the tuition fees obtained by encroachment on the field of entertainment, that is an even more unforgivable crime.

The various schools and institutions that set up poor student tuition fees must seek accurate information in the investigation, which of course cannot be ignored, because this is not an act of fishing for fame and praise, but just seeking to fill the quota. The money and energy you spend must receive equal value in return.

I hope that this bad phenomenon will be quickly eliminated under the strict review and implementation of both parties. Then the poor students will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate.

— Nai Liu

After going to the YWCA on Jing'an Temple Road to get an "Application Form for Student Relief," I spent a morning busily finding guarantors and the principal, finally filling it out carefully. In the afternoon, I couldn't wait any longer and went to exchange it for the admission ticket.

There were quite a few people, small groups of students constantly flowing in and out of the YWCA's entrance. Especially at the place where application forms were obtained, which was also where admission tickets were exchanged, the students crowded around, densely surrounding a clerk. After waiting for quite a while, I finally managed to move forward, and then took out my photo, academic report card, and application form.

The clerk casually asked the person next to me, "Is this your own?"

"Yes."

Then a photo was pasted onto the admission ticket, and the procedure was complete.

When it was my turn, I handed the required items to the clerk, finally able to take a breath and look around. At that moment, I felt extremely strange because, around me, those exchanging for admission tickets mostly looked like young masters; one was wearing a crisp white serge suit, another had his hair permed somewhat like a woman's, and even more... In short, from their attire and behavior, one could tell that their families certainly wouldn't be unable to afford tuition. The female students were the same: applying face cream, curling their hair, and using various other extremely wasteful cosmetics. I thought, even if they saved on these, it could cover a semester's worth of book fees.

"Applying for relief? Is the subsidy meant for you?" I couldn't help but feel a jealous thought towards these young masters and misses. The reason the application office was so busy, the reason collecting admission tickets was so crowded, I blamed it all on them. I said resentfully in my heart, "Who is infringing on the rights of us poor students!"

After completing the procedure, upon exiting, I even saw some "impoverished students" wearing high-heeled leather shoes and buying a popsicle to cool off. Are they deceiving or just pretending?

### Swimming Knowledge

— Qiang

Before entering the water, do several minutes of warm-up exercises and deep breathing to make the limbs flexible. Use cotton to plug the ear canals to prevent ear canal inflammation. After exiting the water, do a full-body dry rub to avoid catching a cold.

Do not swim alone, to prevent no one being available for rescue. Do not swim after eating a full meal, to prevent hindering digestion. Do not swim after strenuous exercise, to prevent the risk of cramps.

If you experience cramps in the water, which is the most dangerous situation, immediately exit the water and massage the affected area with the palm of your hand, or apply hot water.

### The Difficulties of Library Staff (A Reply to Mr. Nai Liu)

— Wei

After reading Mr. Nai Liu's great work for three days, talking about the shortcomings of our library, we, standing in the position of the librarians, besides being ashamed of the inadequacy of our work, are even more grateful to Mr. Nai Liu for giving us very sincere corrections.

Indeed, as Mr. Nai Liu said, sleepy readers are often found in the library's reading room. Of course, the best way is to hope that these napping readers can understand the rules of public places and not hinder public interests as a prerequisite, but in reality, things won't always be so satisfactory, because readers also vary in quality, so this situation is inevitable. Since this is the case, then it is up to the management staff to pay attention; but we also have many difficulties. Because the library's financial expenditure is limited, the manpower is of course also limited, but the work is getting busier day by day, so the management staff cannot allocate work as desired: for example, the reading room only has one manager, he (or she) not only has to manage the number of people entering and exiting, the number of reading cards, but also has to place books and packages. These three tasks already make it impossible for the manager to frequently leave his post to look for readers who are napping or taking too many books; and the readers who are napping mostly sleep very cunningly in corners that are not easily visible, making it difficult for the manager to find them. Therefore, I believe the most thorough solution is to hope that enthusiastic readers will give us more help. If there are such situations, we hope that readers will advise each other, or tell our manager to enforce the rules. In this way, I think we can definitely achieve good results. Of course, these effects are all given to the library by the readers. I wonder what Mr. Nai Liu and the library's readers think? Why not give it a try?

A side note: Since the library recently implemented book inspection, we have discovered that many books have been scribbled on, and a few have been torn out. Although there are still ways to remedy the situation, the most important thing is for all readers to practice the virtue of protecting books. In addition, there are also one or two readers who believe that our book inspection is not thorough enough and should be more detailed. We certainly accept this, and in the past, present, and even the future, we will always strive to achieve the principle of "absolute accuracy." This point can be reassuring to the readers.

Finally, we still hope that readers will provide guidance in various aspects. In short, the library belongs to the public!

### Encroaching on Impoverished Student Scholarships

— Mei Ji

The YWCA saw the extreme seriousness of the problem of students dropping out of school, so it allocated a portion of its funds to establish impoverished student scholarship quotas to reward students from impoverished families with excellent academic performance. This is indeed good news for students who are unable to afford but are determined to pursue further education. Now, many schools are also taking this measure, which is certainly a good deed worthy of our joint efforts.

However, some students whose families are relatively well-off, upon seeing that the school has taken this measure, often harbor selfish thoughts: "I might as well apply and try. If the school approves, wouldn't I be able to get extra 'money for expenses' for nothing? If the school doesn't approve, that's okay too." They disregard the problem of weaker students' ability to further their education, and because they have obtained the money effortlessly through deception, they will also easily misuse it.

Our school has also established impoverished student scholarship quotas. Many outstanding students from impoverished families or those affected by the war have requested it, of course, but not a few students who are able to afford further education have also requested it. The school's review process certainly cannot be completely thorough, so these scholarship quotas will also be occupied by those students who are able to afford further education.

You must know that the impoverished student scholarship quotas established by various schools and institutions are limited. If you occupy a quota, other truly impoverished students will have one less quota? In other words, there will be one more young person dropping out of school. Therefore, I hope that in the future, various schools and institutions that offer impoverished student scholarships will ensure thoroughness in the review process to eliminate this undesirable phenomenon. I further hope that those applying for scholarships will first assess their own family's financial situation to determine whether they are indeed impoverished before applying, and refrain from encroaching on the only tuition fees of general students who are determined but unable to afford further education.

Hawthorne's Investigation

### The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 3: Conflicting Information

He said in surprise, "Strange, how are both arms bare, without even a watch?"

Hawthorne exhaled a puff of smoke and said slowly, "This is another link in the complex problem."

Ni Jinshou seemed not to understand. "What does this mean?"

Hawthorne said, "Originally there was. Look, isn't there a mark on her left wrist? But it doesn't look like a watch, maybe a bracelet. Also, on the ring finger of her left hand and on her ears, there are traces of having worn rings and earrings. Although there are no signs of struggle on her body, the dried blood on the ear holes clearly indicates that it was left when the earrings were removed."

At this moment, the two porters were about to cover the body with a white sheet. Ni Jinshou waved his hand to stop them, squatted down, and looked closely at the places Hawthorne mentioned. Only then did I understand the origin of the dried blood I had just seen on her ears.

Ni Jinshou nodded and said, "Indeed, this adds another layer of trouble."

After the sheet was put on, the other two porters carried the stretcher out. Qin Mozhai followed behind, and when he reached the door, he turned back and added:

"Mr. Hawthorne, Inspector Ni, I hope you will achieve final victory!"

Hawthorne replied, "Thank you. After the work of the forensic examiner is completed, I also hope you will report to Inspector Ni as soon as possible."

Qin Mozhai nodded. "Okay, but Dr. Bai went to Zhenru for official business at dawn today. I don't know when he will be back. As soon as there are results, I will definitely not delay." He walked out.

After this small disturbance ended, the terrifying atmosphere in the room seemed to lessen somewhat. Hawthorne waved to Jinmei again, asking her to come closer. He and Ni Jinshou also returned to their original seats. Ni Jinshou took out his notebook again.

Hawthorne asked, "Jinmei, what jewelry was Miss Wang wearing when she went out last night?"

The maid seemed to think for a moment and replied, "I didn't notice, but she often wore a gold bracelet inlaid with small diamonds when she went out. Maybe she wore it out last night too."

"What kind of ring did she usually wear?"

"A diamond ring, the diamond is as big as a soybean." (38)
