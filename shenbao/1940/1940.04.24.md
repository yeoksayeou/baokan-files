Editorial

### A Serious Message to Mr. Abe Nobuyuki

Abe Nobuyuki, a Japanese general of the army, first class of merit, former Prime Minister, recently arrived in the Chinese occupied territories with the title of Ambassador. Since he entered the port of Wusong at dawn on the 21st of this month, there has been no official announcement from Japan, no lively welcome in Shanghai and Nanjing, and no clear and definitive report from their propaganda organizations; some say that he is still staying in Shanghai, while others say that he has already gone to Nanjing, but no one knows for sure: in short, his movements are somewhat obscure. Originally, Mr. Abe could be said to have been both a general and a prime minister in his own country, holding the highest position, enjoying wealth and honor, and looking down on the court and the countryside, truly everyone watched him closely and bowed their heads; but the Shanghai and Nanjing area, although within the occupied area, is only because people are thinking of the Han, and can't help but be alarmed at every step, then the "Ambassador" comes and goes, also has its reasons for not being too public, not being too extravagant; it should not be that at the time when his "Ambassador" and "Special Envoy" titles are difficult to match the reality, he is regarded as a "Secret Envoy" because he does not understand his movements!

Although Mr. Abe's movements are yet to be examined, his visit to China is real; although his titles are strange, his mission is real; although China and foreign countries do not pay much attention to him, his subjective grand aspirations and heavy responsibilities are real. Because of this, all those who love China, cherish Japan, care about the future of the Far East and the welfare of human civilization, no matter how deeply they hate aggression, they must inevitably feel something for Abe and can not remain silent. Because all mistakes must eventually be corrected, the deeper the mistake, the more the legacy, the greater the harm, and the more the correction requires a wider and longer space of time; this is all unnecessary waste, and has its corresponding tragedy and sin; but it is better to correct it now than to try to correct it later. The correction of mistakes is an inevitable result, is a conclusion of the Kingly Way. Mr. Abe is a learned man, he will be able to recognize that the so-called law of cause and effect and the conclusion of the Kingly Way are by no means pedantic words; he will at least be able to examine the 2,600 years of Japanese history to prove that mistakes have no lasting and stable success, so as to disprove the non-pedantic corruption of the law of cause and effect and the Kingly Way.

It would be too burdensome to trace all the mistakes Japan has made towards China from now on; moreover, there are also a large number of things that the Japanese can never be convinced of and willingly admit as mistakes, so it is not necessary to trace them one by one. But there is one basic point that the Japanese must recognize as a mistake, that is, to estimate the mistake. The artillery fire and bombs that Japan has inflicted on China have widely and deeply awakened national consciousness, invigorated national spirit, and ignited national flames; from this, it has evolved into a unified organization, a strong resistance, and a great new life; from then on, it will be unyielding and indelible. This is what Japan failed to estimate, and it has become the main pivot of all mistakes. The Japanese only use a chaotic history of China, from ancient times to modern times, to the first twenty years of the Republic of China, as the only data for estimating China; they neglected that national consciousness is a latent, innate instinct, they neglected that the right to national survival is a pressing demand of descendants, and they neglected the standing of national leaders. History will not mechanically repeat itself, the vigorous situation in China today, from the leader to the common people, is indeed unprecedented in Chinese history; the thorny issue encountered by those who have invaded China since ancient times is also unprecedented in Chinese history; at the same time, the Chinese people also deeply understand that if China were to face modern extinction, its tragedy would also be unprecedented in the history of China's repeated submission to foreign races. Therefore, the total cause can be extended to all aspects; and among them, it is particularly worthy of Mr. Abe's reference. On a small scale, it must be known that the Chinese people will never regard this war of resistance as a political struggle, but thoroughly recognize it as a national war; on a large scale, it must be known that China will never surrender, and must fulfill its grand wish for national independence and integrity.

The Japanese sometimes seem clumsy; not to mention the distant ones; as for the recent Dutch East Indies issue, it is clear that the United States, Britain, and other countries will advocate maintaining the status quo for the sake of their own vital interests on behalf of the Netherlands, but the Japanese diplomatic authorities are still making boring probes and have provoked some unseemly reactions; again, as for the naval quality issue, it is clear that the United States, Britain, and other countries are determined to maintain the 5-5-3 ratio, but because Japan attempted to break through this 60 percent, it has caused a "can't afford" shipbuilding competition; again, as for the Soviet Union's skill and knowledge in international politics, Japan ignores everything and unilaterally publicizes that the Soviet Union is seeking a compromise with Japan, which is clearly only for cafe chatter and is not enough to deceive the diplomats of various countries. As expected, it has prompted the Soviet side to resolutely publish its ruthless denial. All of these things may not be clumsy, but only loyal and using all means; calm and fair commentators are even unwilling to judge the Japanese as clumsy. Therefore, the Japanese, while trying their political strategy towards China, are still trying to maintain their military points and lines; while looking forward to using war to support war, they still have to formulate a huge wartime budget; while declaring support for the Nanjing organization, they still do not hesitate to say that they have no hope of resolving the so-called incident and realizing the so-called peace. When Mr. Abe was saying goodbye to Tokyo, even the Japanese propaganda organizations did not say anything about his grand vision, which shows that Mr. Abe is not clumsy.

Then, what will Mr. Abe use to report back when he leaves? The clumsiest thing to do is to deceive himself and others, to follow some diplomatic path, to do some diplomatic procedures, to talk about what to argue for and what to concede, and to think about what to agree to and sign to complete his so-called accomplished facts? To be honest, if the total strength of Japan is enough to cope with the international environment and maintain its policy of aggression, if the Japanese army invading China can cope with China's final counterattack for a long time, then why should they sign a treaty; otherwise, even if they sign a treaty, who will admit that it is valid! An invalid agreement and signing will not make Japan get more and China lose more, but will increase an unnecessary concern for Japan in the future when correcting mistakes, and reduce the courage and opportunity to correct mistakes as soon as possible. Some say: Japan will express Japan's concession to the status quo by Mr. Abe's signing of the treaty. Let us not ask whether this statement is credible or not, and even more unnecessary to ask about the so-called degree of concession; China originally has nothing to ask for, but only wants the complete independence and integrity of the country without any discount. If Mr. Abe does not deceive himself and others, if Mr. Abe has the ambition and skill of a great statesman, then what he uses to report back is definitely not a waste of paper, but only to fulfill his loyalty, to advocate the immediate recall of the army, to fundamentally abandon the policy of aggression against China, and to work with an independent and complete China for the stability and welfare of the Far East. The Chinese people value the Kingly Way most, and are not clumsy, so they are both looking forward to Japan's reversal of its plans and sharpening their resistance.

### American Rear Admiral Taussig Points Out the Crisis of War Between the United States and Japan; Advocates Close Cooperation with Britain, France, and the Netherlands; Strengthen Defenses of the Philippines and Guam

Washington: Rear Admiral Taussig, commander of the Fifth Naval District, told the Senate Naval Affairs Committee yesterday that he believed a war between the United States and Japan was inevitable. Japan was seeking to dominate the Far East and intended to conquer the Philippines, French Indochina, and the Dutch East Indies. The "Tanaka Memorial" of 1927 included a plan to conquer the world, and this plan began with the intention to "overthrow the United States..." "For the sake of the future of the Far East, we should take economic and financial measures to maintain the integrity of China... Japan is a stubborn and bellicose nation whose promises are worthless." Rear Admiral Taussig further stated that the only hope for the United States was to build an invincible navy so that Japan would not dare to challenge it. Strong defenses should also be established in the Philippines and Guam, creating major trade routes, and cooperating with Britain and France to maintain the status quo in the Far East. Rear Admiral Taussig also stated that if Germany won in the current European war, then we would "suffer the oppression of totalitarian states." Senator Rogers asked whether the United States should join other powers in fighting Japan to maintain the integrity of China. Rear Admiral Taussig replied, "We are a signatory to maintain the integrity of China." (United Press dispatch of the 23rd)

Washington: Former Deputy Chief of Naval Operations Rear Admiral Taussig recently delivered a speech to the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, stating in brief: (1) Our national interests are clearly threatened by the situation in the Far East. We need a stable and independent China. As a result of the evolution of the situation in the Far East according to the current trend, I really do not know how the United States can avoid being drawn into the vortex of war. Therefore, we must take action so that we will not be forced to duel with Japan in the future." (2) I propose that Britain, France, and the Netherlands should assist the United States and negotiate with the United States to allow the United States to use their bases in the Pacific. If a conflict were to occur between Japan and the United States, it would inevitably be a naval battle. Our country cannot advance on Japan, and Japan cannot invade our country, but it can be asserted that Japan will attempt to invade the Philippines. For this reason, I believe that the United States must, on the one hand, build an "indestructible" naval base in the Philippine Islands and, on the other hand, continue to build battleships without interruption. (Havas dispatch of the 22nd)

New York: After Rear Admiral Taussig, former Deputy Chief of Naval Operations of the United States, submitted a report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday, there was much speculation from the outside world. Therefore, he issued a statement today, stating that his report did not mean that war between the United States and Japan was imminent. He said, "Judging from the reports in some newspapers, my report yesterday seemed to indicate that a war between the United States and Japan was inevitable. In fact, I do not believe that such a war is imminent at all, and I do not want to be an alarmist. What I wanted to explain at the time was that, based on the current situation, a war will be triggered at some uncertain time in the future, but if we can make our country militarily prepared, this war can still be avoided, and our country can still maintain peace. In short, the sole purpose of my entire report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was to find a way to keep us at peace forever." (Havas dispatch of the 23rd)

Washington: When Rear Admiral Taussig, former Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, delivered a speech to the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, he believed that war between the United States and Japan was inevitable. Secretary of State Hull recently told reporters that the government's foreign policy was very clear. What Taussig talked about was obviously his personal opinion. (Havas dispatch of the 22nd)

Washington: Regarding the speech delivered by Rear Admiral Taussig, former Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, to the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, the Navy Department recently issued a public statement by Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, stating that what Taussig expressed was only his personal opinion and did not reflect the views or policies of the Navy Department, and that it was contrary to the views of the Navy Department. The precautionary measures he suggested were not directed at any country, but were purely based on prudent considerations, so that our country's naval power could maintain a proportion with the navies of other countries. (Havas dispatch of the 22nd)

Washington: Political figures here have commented on the speech delivered by Rear Admiral Taussig, former Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, that war between the United States and Japan is inevitable, saying that although this speech is a personal opinion of the rear admiral, its nature is extremely important and its significance is even more profound. His proposal that Britain, France, and the United States should cooperate with each other is a natural result of recent events. For example, there is the saying that Japan is building eight super battleships of 45,000 tons, two of which have been completed. This is one. Japan is expanding the scope of its current commercial treaty with a certain Latin American country, attempting to offset the influence of the United States in Latin America. This is two. Japan is demanding the right to continue to immigrate to the Philippine Islands. This is three. If the Netherlands is invaded by Germany, the fate of the Dutch East Indies will be shaken. This is four. From this point of view, Taussig's warning is not without reason. (Havas dispatch of the 22nd)

### Philippines Decides to Limit Japanese Immigration; Japanese Side Requests the United States to Intervene with the Philippines; Hull Indicates It is Inappropriate to Interfere

Washington: Secretary of State Hull sent the Philippine immigration restriction proposal to Philippine President Quezon yesterday without adding any comments, implying that the Philippine government could "proceed" with this bill unless the Philippine government voluntarily made concessions to Japan. Washington's opinion is that this restriction does not discriminate against any country, so it is widely believed that President Roosevelt will not oppose it. Hull said that the Philippine government has its legal rights on such matters, and the United States will not interfere or exert pressure. When the Secretary of State also touched on the remarks made yesterday by Rear Admiral Taussig, commander of the Fifth Naval District, that a US-Japan war was inevitable, he said that Rear Admiral Taussig was only expressing his personal opinion, and the State Department's policy had been clarified previously. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)

Washington: Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horinouchi asked US Secretary of State Hull on Saturday and Sunday to intervene with the Philippines, which is planning to legislate to limit the number of Japanese entering the country to 500 people per year. Hull stated today that the US government does not want to impose its own opinions on the Philippine legislature on this matter, nor does it want to exert pressure. (Reuters dispatch of the 22nd)

### Changing Situation in the Norwegian War; German Troops in Narvik are Surrounded; British, French, and Norwegian Allied Forces Advance South in Two Routes; Trondheim Port Will Become the Site of a Decisive Battle

Stockholm, Sweden: The "Dagens Nyheter" recently reported that the Allied forces of Britain and France and the Norwegian army have surrounded the German troops in the Narvik port area. (Havas dispatch of the 23rd)

Paris: A Havas correspondent at the Norwegian front recently telegraphed that the Norwegian and British-French Allied forces are now advancing south in two routes: one route is heading straight for Trondheim port with rapid progress, and fierce fighting has occurred in the city of Balslevanger (located 15 kilometers southeast between South Oslo and Trondheim). Another route is advancing towards the city of Stenkjer between Trondheim port and the Norwegian capital. The German troops in that area are now taking a defensive posture due to their isolation. In addition, the German troops in Narvik port have already withdrawn and are now cut into several sections by the Allied forces, but they are still hoping to resist near the port. According to Norwegian military experts, the German troops in Norway are expected to collapse within days. (Havas dispatch of the 23rd)

Paris: Military circles here have recently confirmed that British troops have arrived in southern Norway to reinforce the Norwegian army there. It is widely believed that the arrival of British troops on the front line there is a very important action. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)

Stockholm: British and German troops have each advanced fiercely towards the largest battlefield of this European war today. This large battlefield is located in the area between Hamar and Lillehammer. According to news from southern Sweden, the Germans are advancing their transport planes, soldiers, aircraft, and various war supplies towards southern Norway, while the Allied forces are also moving rapidly south and mobilizing other troops landing on the coast. The German troops are now intensifying their shelling of the areas around South Oslo, Dubes, and Lillehammer, attempting to prevent the Allied forces from communicating and destroying their lines, and replacing them with their own troops. According to witnesses, the port of South Oslo, where the first detachment of British troops landed, has been completely destroyed. However, the troops and equipment of the Allied forces are said to have already been transported inland. The roads and villages east and southeast of South Oslo were heavily bombed on Sunday by the air force from southern Norway. The important railway and road from Andalsnes to Hamar, and the branch road from Trondheim to Dombås, were also heavily bombed on Monday. The Allied forces are said to be mechanized and well-equipped, with light tanks, anti-aircraft guns, heavy artillery, and excellent flat-trajectory guns. It is also reported that an Allied force detachment that was attacked by German planes near Steinkjer has shot down five of the seven German planes that carried out the air raid. (United Press dispatch of the 23rd)

Stockholm, Sweden: According to local reports, a British troop train has arrived at Storlin, a railway junction 30 miles south of Trondheim. Fighting has now broken out in Veresolora, northeast of Trondheim. German planes have repeatedly bombed the highways and railways connecting South Oslo and Trondheim, but although telephone lines are said to be cut, the railway has not been severely damaged. In addition, Steinkjer, where several Norwegian troops are stationed, was heavily bombed by German planes and caught fire and is currently burning. After British planes bombed the airfields in the Trondheim area, the Germans felt it was more difficult to send planes for air raids. Although the Germans claimed that German troops had occupied Lillehammer, between Hamar and Dombås, the vanguard of 750 British troops has now arrived in that area, and more British troops are arriving one after another from Andalsnes. According to another report, the railway from Andalsnes and then to the Guobolangstai Valley is now entirely in the hands of the Allied forces. The railways and highways are guarded by heavy troops of the Allied forces, and the German attempt to cut off these routes by using paratroopers to land has failed. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)

London: According to reliable sources, British troops are now launching fierce attacks on German troops along the coast of northern Norway. They have made considerable progress in the direction of the city of Stiekstad (40 miles northeast of Trondheim). It is reported that the German troops in the city of Stanger (20 miles north of Stiekstad) have been defeated and are retreating. It is also reported by well-informed sources that the British and French Allied forces, after landing at the port of South Oslo, are joining forces with the Norwegian army and pointing south, looking to take Trondheim port. Although German planes are constantly bombing and strafing with machine guns, the railway and various lines of communication leading to Trondheim are said to be controlled by the Allied forces. As for the Narvik port area, a major battle is about to begin. There are 1,000 German soldiers in that area, who have been surrounded. Although the areas near the Swedish border are in German hands, the surrounding areas are all Norwegian army units. In addition, according to semi-official sources, the strategic point of Langstel Bay in Norway is completely in the hands of the Allied forces, and British troops have advanced to the city of Lillehammer. (Havas dispatch of the 23rd)

Berlin: Regarding the German occupation of Gorvik, the Havas News Agency obtained the following statement last night: "German troops occupied Gorvik after a fierce battle with Norwegian troops. At first, the Norwegian troops resisted very strongly, but when a large number of German armored vehicle units arrived, the Norwegian troops felt overwhelmed and began to retreat. The German troops then occupied Gorvik after heavily damaging the Norwegian troops. (Havas dispatch of the 23rd)

### German Planes Continuously Attack British Positions for Days, Targeting Railway Transportation for Destruction; Hydroelectric Plant in Northern Norway Has Been Destroyed

London: The Berlin official communication agency described the situation of the air raid on South Oslo, saying that German planes bombed British positions for six hours. The German planes attacked continuously, and the number of casualties could not be accurately determined. The railway station has been destroyed. According to a communique released in London yesterday regarding the German air raid near South Oslo, the town of South Oslo was quite damaged, but the only loss on the Allied side was the sinking of a British fishing boat. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)

Berlin: The German High Command announced this morning that our air force yesterday concentrated on bombing British landing troops near South Oslo and Andalsnes. The important railway junction of Dombås has been destroyed, and the stations of Andalsnes and South Oslo have been heavily damaged. Two British transport ships were bombed and sunk, and another was set on fire. British warships protecting the transport ships were also hit by bombs. (Havas dispatch of the 23rd)

Grolong City: A Havas frontline correspondent recently telegraphed that German planes again bombed the highway from South Oslo to Grolong City and to the ports of Leversang and Trondheim this afternoon, with Grolong City being the main target. In addition, a train heading south of the city was also bombed. (Havas dispatch of the 22nd)

Berlin: Dr. Keller, a German war correspondent, described the German air force's bombing of Narvik and the destruction of the Trolmsø hydroelectric plant, which is 150 kilometers from the town. He said that German bombers took off from an airfield in southern Norway and moved north. The task assigned to the team was to bomb the Trolmsø hydroelectric plant. When the air force in the plane discovered the iron tower of the Trolmsø broadcasting station, they knew that the hydroelectric plant was not far away and continued to move forward, flying over high mountains and ridges. In the valley, they discovered a large building, which was the hydroelectric plant they were searching for. However, they immediately encountered ground machine gun fire. Our planes then dropped bombs, which exploded a few meters in front of the building. Our planes circled several times and then dropped bombs on the plant again. The machine room was hit, and the entire plant was damaged. Seconds later, yellowish-brown water rushed out, as the reservoir had also been hit and destroyed. The hydroelectric plant was rendered useless. At this point, the mission was completed, and the radio operator sent a wireless report to headquarters. After flying low for several circles, they flew back to their original defense. (Havas dispatch of the 23rd)

### Britain Strengthens Naval Power by Adding Five Main Ships; Displacement is Over 40,000 Tons; "Unsinkable Ship" Ideal is Approaching

London: Mr. Pewart, a naval defense expert for the "News Chronicle," stated that the British Navy will soon increase its most powerful warships in the world by five ships. Their names have been determined as "George V," "Prince of Wales," "Duke of York," "Jericho," and "Petty," and they are currently undergoing testing. These five ships are the largest warships that Britain has ever built. Only the "Lion," "Dauntless," and two other unnamed ships currently under construction have forms that exceed them. The displacement of these four ships will be at least 40,000 tons each. The various equipment of the five "George V" ships are different from those of the British old warships. Each is equipped with ten 14-inch main guns, sixteen 5.5-inch guns, and many light guns. Each ship carries three aircraft and 1,500 officers and soldiers. Although "unsinkable" warships are still an ideal, the "George V" may be closer to this concept than any previous ship. The percentage of weight used for underwater defense against torpedoes has greatly increased. If the armor installed on the sides and deck of the ship is included, its total weight accounts for 40 percent of the total displacement of 35,000 tons of the entire ship, which is a new world record. The speed exceeds 30 knots per hour, and the endurance has also greatly increased. The firepower and range of its 14-inch guns exceed those of the old ships' 15-inch guns and can penetrate thicker armor. The above five ships have been completed and launched early, and the British Navy's main battle force will increase to 19 ships, with at least four more under construction. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)

### British Aircraft Continue to Fly Over Denmark and Norway to Bomb German Air Force Bases; Aalborg Implements Curfew

London: The Ministry of Aviation recently announced, "Our planes flew over Norway and Denmark again last night" to attack enemy air force bases. Bombs were dropped on two airfields near Oslo, and many incendiary bombs were dropped on Funa airfield, and the field immediately caught fire and spread. In addition, the Aalborg airfield in Denmark was also bombed. According to news from the German side, four of our planes were shot down last night. This is completely untrue. In fact, only one of our planes did not return to its base. (Havas dispatch of the 23rd)

London: According to the Danish capital radio station controlled by the Germans, Aalborg has implemented a curfew since the airfield was attacked twice by the British Air Force. From 9 pm to 4:30 am, civilians are not allowed to linger on the streets, except for those traveling for work and doctors and nurses. The radio detailed the defense measures during the air raid and warned listeners outside of Aalborg that other parts of Denmark might be declared in a state of air raid danger. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)

### Statistics on British and German Ship Losses; London Official Announcement

### German Planes Discovered on the Southeast Coast of Britain at Night; Their Intention Was to Lay Mines; British Planes Intercepted and Repelled Them

London: Last night, planes that seemed to be from the German side were discovered off the southeast coast of Britain. The sound of heavy artillery was heard, and there were flashes of light in the sea like exploding bombs.

(Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)

London: The British Air Force Department recently stated that several enemy planes were discovered off the coast of East Anglia and the southeast coast last night.

### British Chancellor of the Exchequer Proposes Wartime Budget with Expenditures Exceeding £200 Million, Increases Taxes to Make Up the Shortfall

London - Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon presented the second wartime budget to the House of Commons today. As expected in September of last year, the Chancellor proposed increasing the standard rate of income tax from seven shillings to seven shillings and sixpence. He stated that expenditures for the first seven months of the war were £905,000,000, and the expenditure rate seems to be increasing. The total planned expenditure for this year is £2,667,000,000, of which £2,000,000,000 is specifically for the war effort. This amount is certainly huge, but if the administrative departments did not intend to economize on expenditures, it would be even larger. I believe that if the heads of departments, officials, and the public can continue to do their best to economize on their expenses, it will be a valuable contribution to winning the war. The Chancellor also stated that of the £500,000,000 in debt previously approved by the House of Commons, £91,500,000 remains. A surtax will be levied on annual incomes exceeding £1,500. The tax on each type of beer will be increased by one penny. The tax on each bottle of whiskey will be increased to one shilling and ninepence halfpenny. The tobacco tax will be increased to four shillings per pound. The match tax will be fifty pence per twelve dozen (boxes). Letter postage will increase by one penny. Imperial postage rates remain unchanged. Foreign postage was previously two and a half pence and is now three pence. Airmail postage remains unchanged. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

### London Celebrates St. George's Day, Churchill Does Not Deliver Speech

London - Due to his busy official duties today, Naval Minister Churchill was unable to attend the St. George's Day banquet in London and deliver a broadcast speech. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

### Germany and Romania Sign Trade Agreement, Stipulating Germany Exchange Arms for Romanian Oil

Bucharest - An official gazette published here last night stated that negotiations between German and Romanian representatives to conclude a supplementary annex to the German-Romanian economic treaty have now concluded. It is understood that the content includes provisions for Germany to exchange arms for Romanian oil. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

Bucharest - It was officially announced here last night that Romania has signed a commercial treaty with Germany. Romania will continue to sell 130,000 tons of oil to Germany each month. Sources familiar with the matter say that Germany has apparently obtained favorable terms for purchasing oil. Germany's recent requests for several other raw materials have not been met. However, it is generally believed that Romania will seek to satisfy Germany's needs. People here believe that Romania has agreed to include Bohemia and Moravia within Germany's trade scope, but Romania has refused Germany's request to increase the exchange rate with the Romanian currency. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)

### Britain and France Use Diplomatic Tactics in Attempt to Alienate Soviet-Italian Relations, Britain Promises Soviet Benefits to Prevent Raw Materials from Being Shipped to Germany, Franco-Italian Outstanding Issues Negotiating Opinions Clash

Stockholm Capital - The Stockholm Times correspondent in Moscow cables that when commenting on the matter of German troops invading Norway, all Soviet newspapers adopted a neutral attitude. At the same time, the Soviet authorities are working hard to establish friendly relations with Yugoslavia. This is not unrelated to the activities of the Allied countries attempting to separate Germany and the Soviet Union. In short, Moscow has now become the center of diplomatic activities for all parties, and Stalin and Molotov are in a very advantageous position, and can also take advantage of the situation to profit. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)

Rome - Regarding the rumors from Britain and France that the Allied countries will take diplomatic steps in Rome and Moscow, official sources here remain tight-lipped. Political sources familiar with the matter say that even if Britain and France want to carry out certain activities in Rome and Moscow, they may not be able to produce any new situation. It is rumored that Britain will conduct contacts with the Soviet Union, while France will negotiate with Italy. This probably proves that Britain knows that Anglo-Italian negotiations are hopeless, and at the same time, Franco-Italian issues such as Corsica, Tunisia, and the Suez Canal are also very different, making it difficult to get closer. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 23rd)

London - According to reliable sources here, if Britain and the Soviet Union sign a new trade agreement, the Soviet Union will guarantee not to re-export goods from Britain or overseas neutral countries to Germany. This news is the first indication that the Soviet Union may be turning to the British economic track. Generally, it is believed that the Allied countries' diplomatic war against Soviet foreign policy is only beginning to yield results favorable to the Allied countries. According to news obtained by a reporter from an authoritative source in the Soviet Union, although the Soviet Union is willing to allow and prevent British or neutral countries' goods from being shipped to Germany, in exchange for Britain's goodwill in concluding a new trade agreement with the Soviet Union, it is currently unwilling to discuss the issue of reducing its own exports to Germany. According to the Soviet Union's permission, the Soviet Union must fulfill one of the two preconditions for signing the agreement proposed by the British representative last Saturday. These two conditions are: (1) The Soviet Union decides absolutely not to re-export British goods to Germany; (2) The Soviet Union begins to limit its own raw materials or industrial products from being shipped to Germany. According to the British side, in view of the current war situation, these two conditions are the only basis for the conclusion of an Anglo-Soviet agreement. According to the Soviet Union, it seems prepared to expand the scope of the original text of the first condition and also include neutral countries' goods in the ban. Regarding the second condition, a Soviet spokesman said, "If Britain is willing to buy Soviet goods at a good price, Soviet exports to Germany will naturally decrease." It is generally expected that the above opinions will be raised when Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky holds private talks with British officials. (International News Agency dispatch, 23rd)

Rome - Regarding the rumors from Paris that the French government has warned the Italian government that if Italy attacks Yugoslavia, France will consider Italy to be formally participating in the war, official sources in Rome have denied this. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 23rd)

London - Havas News Agency has recently learned from reliable sources that German leader Hitler did intend to attack Hungary and Yugoslavia at the beginning of this week, and believed that Italy, in order to protect its interests, could also send troops to intervene in the South. The scope of the war can be expanded to the Balkan Peninsula and the Mediterranean Basin, but until the last moment, Italy did not agree, either because the conditions it raised were not fulfilled by the German side, or because the Italian government temporarily changed its attitude, one of the two must be true. Therefore, although Germany has concentrated troops on the borders of Hungary and Yugoslavia, Italy has not followed suit. Italy's attitude is still a question at this time and should not be taken too optimistically. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

### Italy Expands Air Force, Three-Year Plan Requires 7.6 Billion Lire

Rome - The government recently submitted a three-year air force expansion plan to the Fascist Professional Organization Council, proposing to allocate 7.6 billion lire to strengthen the air force and expand bases. The allocation is as follows: (1) 300 million lire for the 1940 fiscal year; (2) 350 million lire for the 1941 fiscal year; (3) 110 million lire for the 1942 fiscal year. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)

### Anglo-French Blockade Policy Against Germany to be Implemented in Southeast Europe

Paris - Political figures here recently stated that Britain and France have decided to intensify the blockade of Germany in Southeast Europe, preventing it from obtaining needed goods from there. Germany has sent Economic Director-General Clodius of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Romania, and sent Agriculture Minister Darré to Hungary, in an attempt to offset the Anglo-French plan. However, Germany's hope of obtaining supplies from Eastern Europe, especially food, is very slim. It is estimated that the countries in the Danube River basin will have a poor harvest this year, and Britain and France are also purchasing extensively. Therefore, the grain needed by Germany is becoming increasingly scarce. Generally, when British Foreign Secretary Halifax recently held talks with Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky, the plan to intensify the blockade of Germany was also involved. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

### Tianjin Silver Deposit Problem, British and Japanese Merchants Reach Agreement, One-Eighth of the Silver Deposit Used for Relief Funds, the Remainder Sealed in the Tianjin Bank of Communications

London - According to reliable sources here, the news that Britain and Japan have agreed on a solution to the Tianjin British Concession silver deposit problem has been widely reported and is about to be signed. British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax had lunch at the Japanese Embassy in Britain yesterday. British and Japanese diplomats in the Far East are making final discussions on the Tianjin silver problem. After the Japanese army lifts the blockade of the Tianjin British Concession, both sides can sign an agreement. It is generally believed that the agreement will include the following three points: (1) Chinese silver stored in the British Concession, totaling US$800,000, will be used with US$100,000 for North China relief funds, and the remaining US$700,000 will be sealed in the Tianjin Bank of Communications; (2) The British authorities will not hinder the circulation of legal tender and United Reserve Bank notes in the Concession; (3) The British Concession authorities will allow Japanese police to cooperate in cracking down on Chinese terrorists in the British Concession.

London - Foreign Secretary Halifax recently attended a luncheon at the Japanese Embassy. Japanese Foreign Ministry Special Envoy Kawai was also present. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 22nd)

### Britain Pays Attention to the Dutch East Indies Issue

London - According to general opinion, Britain still considers the Dutch East Indies to be one of the issues that warrants serious attention. British experts on Far Eastern issues believe that if Germany invades the Netherlands, it is hoped that the United States can take various steps to prevent Japan from occupying the Dutch East Indies. If the United States resists Japan, Britain will naturally be able to provide assistance. However, political circles feel that this kind of public expression and imagination seems inappropriate, believing that such expressions only serve to affect Britain's goals, only make the flames of American isolationism rise, and mistakenly believe that Britain wants to involve the United States in the Far East disputes. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)

### American Ships Patrol Philippine Waters, Monitoring British Ship Movements

Manila - The Manila newspaper reported reliable news that two American warships have been ordered to sail out to monitor the movements of a certain British ship, because it is heard that the British ship is doing something in the Philippine waters. This move by the United States is carried out in accordance with neutrality laws. The US Navy authorities have used local wireless to call soldiers back to their ships in the past three days, saying that they will hold special exercises. It is heard that last week a British ship instructed a merchant ship at a certain point between Manila and Northern Luzon to prove its nationality. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 23rd)

### Japanese Government Develops North Sea Fishing Rights, Establishes Fishing Company to Compete with the Soviet Union

Tokyo - According to sources familiar with the matter, the Japanese government will establish a fishing company in the North Sea in accordance with its established national policy. The total capital is set at 120 million yen, in order to protect the fishing rights of the Japanese in that area and to cope with the competition or interference from the Soviet Union. The company will be formed by merging nine major fishing companies. In addition to providing a portion of the capital, the government will also be in a supervisory position and has the right to appoint and remove directors and decide on the distribution of funds and profits. For several years, the fishing rights of the Japanese in the North Sea have been repeatedly infringed upon by the Soviet Union, and they have often failed to receive government assistance. It is believed that future negotiations will definitely obtain better conditions. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

Tokyo - According to Japanese sources, it is heard from responsible parties that four Japanese fishing boats were recently detained by the Soviet side in the high seas of Posiet Bay. The news reported in the news this morning that 20 Japanese fishing boats were fishing outside Posiet Bay and were detained by the Soviet side is quite shocking. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

### Corpses Litter the Qinghu Line, Refugees Arriving in Shanghai Say They Stepped Over Corpses Along the Way

Since last Sunday (the 14th), the Japanese military authorities dispatched Japanese cavalry from all directions, guided by the Xu pseudo-forces, to carry out a major search and suppression of Gu Fusheng's troops stationed there. Gu's troops calmly resisted for a considerable period of time using mobile tactics and then quietly withdrew, which ultimately resulted in the Japanese and puppet forces suffering losses without gains. The Japanese and puppet forces then vented their anger on the local farmers, burning and killing at will wherever they went. It is said that the losses near Guanyintang (about ten miles southeast of Huangdu) were the most severe. According to a certain gentleman who was captured and escaped, the mile or so he escaped through was completely traversed by stepping over corpses. The amount of slaughter is generally visible. Near Panlong Zhudi, corpses were piled up along the road, the heat was steaming, and the stench was flying, which was too horrible to bear. Since the 20th, the Japanese troops gathered there have slightly stopped their brutal actions, but the residents are still avoiding them in fear. At the same time, security announcements have been found posted on the walls of Panlong Zhudi, but the evacuated residents dare not return. It is also rumored that Gu's troops will unite with the New Fourth Army and the Tian Huizi troops to come and retaliate, so residents who continue to evacuate to other places are still continuously on their way, and the Japanese and puppet troops stationed there are very panicked.

### Japan's Wartime Financial Burden: Foreign Exchange Shortage and Inflation Relying on Loans for War Expenses

Japan launched the war of aggression against China, aiming for a quick victory, believing that it could achieve complete success in a few months. Therefore, it did not prepare for a long-term war. Initially, it did not expect the Chinese people to be united and valiantly resist, and now it has been nearly three years, and the more they fight, the more spirited they become. Japan, on the other hand, has revealed a state of financial and human resource distress. According to a Reuters Tokyo dispatch, Prime Minister Yonai admitted that "the Japanese people have never had the experience of a long-term war, nor have they suffered the severe hardships experienced by European countries, so it is not easy to cope with the war situation." A few days ago, Army Minister Hata Shunroku, in a speech at the annual meeting of Japanese army division commanders, also admitted that "there are trends in domestic and foreign events that do not allow for an optimistic view of the overall situation," and urged the military to strive for frugality in the use of materials and the payment of funds. However, with the situation deadlocked, it is impossible to reduce military spending. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the government intends to reduce the expenditures already approved by the Diet, consulting with the Ministry of Finance and the Army and Navy, and the authorities of each ministry are trying to be as frugal as possible. However, a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Army immediately denied this, saying that the army's expenses have been reduced to an absolute minimum and cannot be reduced any further. The military is resolute, and the Ministry of Finance is suffering. As for manpower, the Japanese government has implemented a ban on shops employing men aged 12 to 30 and women aged 12 to 20, starting from March 1, intending to absorb young men and women into munitions factories and various factories engaged in national policy work. War takes financial and human resources as the main factors for victory. Now that both are in such dire straits, how can one talk about victory? Even maintaining the status quo for a long time is extremely difficult.

On March 14, the London Financial Times published an article saying that Japan's war of aggression against China has been going on for nearly three years. Although its power to continue the war has not been exhausted, in recent months, resources have been greatly depleted, and people in the country have generally believed that the "China Incident" urgently needs to be ended in a relatively short period of time. The Royal Bank of Canada once stated that the Japanese people now keenly feel that the government's huge expenditures are too burdensome, and most of the funds come from severely increased tax rates and huge numbers of domestic public bonds. The seven-year military equipment program submitted to the Diet last month, totaling 2.858 trillion yen (one trillion is one million yen, the same below), will greatly increase the burden on the people. The decreasing volume of trade between Japan and countries outside the yen bloc has made foreign exchange even scarcer. The import control regulations have recently become more and more stringent so that raw materials needed for the war industry, such as iron sand, crude rubber, and kerosene, can be continuously transported into Japan. Rice is the main food, but due to severe drought and poor autumn harvests in Korea, there is a severe food shortage. Due to the drought and shallow river water, the output of hydroelectric power has been greatly reduced, coupled with the lack of coal, the situation is even more serious. In the past three years, Japan's annual national expenditure has more than doubled (from 5 billion to more than 10 billion). The military expenses used for the Sino-Japanese War in these three years are roughly as follows: the fiscal year 1937 to 1938 was 2.500 trillion, 1938 to 1939 was 4.800 trillion, and 1939 to 1940 was 5.300 trillion yen. If the land and sea military expenditures not directly related to the "China Incident" are included, the total amount is (1) 4.000 trillion, (2) 6.000 trillion, and (3) 7.100 trillion yen in the order of the above years. In 1940 to 1941, this expenditure was about 6.755 trillion yen. If the seven-year military equipment program is passed by the Diet, the total amount will increase to 7.164 trillion yen. The tax rate was already very heavy, but now it has been increased, and new taxes have been levied. The amount of tax revenue from 1936 to 1937 was 1.051 trillion yen, which increased to 2.245 trillion yen from 1939 to 1940. It is estimated that in 1940 to 1941, this income may increase to 400 trillion yen. In order to make up for the huge war expenses, it is necessary to raise huge amounts of debt. The public bonds raised from 1939 to 1940 exceeded those from 1936 to 1937 by about nine times. These are all raised domestically. As for foreign debt, it was 1.312 trillion yen in July 1937, which decreased to 1269 trillion yen in September 1939. In June 1939, one month before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the total amount of domestic debt was 10.380 trillion yen. By the end of the year, it had increased to 11.893 trillion yen. By the end of 1938, it had increased to 16.223 trillion yen. In October 1939, it had increased to 20.457 trillion yen. The Minister of Finance recently announced that from 1940 to 1941, the government will raise new debts of 5.797 trillion yen, so the total amount of domestic debt will reach 26.253 trillion yen. During the war, the number of banknotes in circulation increased greatly. In July 1937, the total amount was 1.580 trillion yen. By the end of 1938, it had increased to 2.755 trillion yen. By the end of 1939, it had increased to 3.817 trillion yen, exceeding the tax-free limit of 2.701 trillion yen. In addition to regular banknotes, the army authorities also issued "military scrip" to pay for the soldiers' salaries in China. This scrip is mostly absorbed through exchange and has become a part of Japan's regular issuance. However, the details of the military scrip have not been announced by the authorities. Japan's main financial problem is still the lack of foreign exchange. In the first ten months of 1939, Japan's trade with countries outside the yen bloc had a trade deficit of more than 437 trillion yen, compared with 496 trillion yen in the same period in 1938. Trade between Japan and countries within the yen bloc accounted for 25% of Japan's total exports in 1937, and now it has reached 50%. As a result, in 1939, there was a trade surplus of 814 trillion yen. Because a large part of this trade is the re-export of goods obtained from countries outside the yen bloc, Japan pays out foreign exchange and receives only yen. This shows that at least half of the trade surplus within the yen bloc is a huge factor in causing a shortage of foreign exchange. In the first ten months of 1939, the total amount of foreign exchange shortage was estimated at about 700 trillion yen, excluding allocations for invisible trade items. Japan is currently implementing a strict commodity distribution system to ensure that the scarce raw materials purchased with foreign exchange are only used for things necessary for the war. However, imported raw materials are then made into goods and are allowed to be exported and sold in order to increase foreign exchange. In order to encourage trade, a linkage system was implemented in March 1938, linking the import of raw materials with the export of finished goods. The number of raw materials imported is limited to the value of the goods containing such raw materials previously exported. However, the Japanese government issued strict regulations prohibiting the transportation of these goods to countries within the yen bloc. This regulation had some effect in the first seven months of 1937 because exports increased by 10% during this period. However, it is still lower than 35% of the total exports in 1937. The system initially allocated 300 trillion yen from the total gold reserves as working capital for expenses. As the foreign exchange for international payments continues to be short, Japan's gold is also flowing abroad. The gold shipped to the United States each month in 1937 was worth about 90 trillion yen. The gold shipped to the United States each month in 1938 and 1939 was also worth as much as 60 trillion yen. It is now believed that in addition to the 500 trillion yen of liquid reserves still stored in the Bank of Japan, the amount of gold remaining in the country is very small. Therefore, efforts are being made to increase the output of gold mines. The current annual gold production is worth about 200 trillion yen. On November 11, 1939, a plan to encourage gold production was implemented, giving an additional 12 yen or so per gram of gold produced above the normal amount compared to the US gold price, with the increase ranging from 25% to 50%. In short, according to the Royal Bank of Canada, Japan has taken into account the huge cost of the war, so its financial affairs are handled with great competence and foresight. However, it did not expect China's resistance to be so prolonged, and in recent months, the state of being stretched has become increasingly exposed. Although there is no immediate sign of any collapse, based on the current situation, it can only be maintained by continuing inflation and allowing prices to rise and living standards to deteriorate.

### U.S. Ambassador to Japan Visits Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs to State U.S. Position on Tianjin Concession Blockade

Tokyo: U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew visited Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tani at 11:00 a.m. today to discuss the recent intensification of the blockade of the Tianjin Concession and explain the impact on American citizens. (Kyodo News Agency dispatch from the 23rd)

Washington: It has been learned that U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew is scheduled to return to the country for vacation in a short period of time. (Havas dispatch from the 22nd)

### Water Supply Panic in Tokyo

Tokyo: Tokyo's engineering department estimates that unless there is heavy rain, Tokyo may run out of water within a month. Tokyo's current water officials go to shrines every day to pray for the water god to quickly send heavy rain. The water in the Murayama and Yamaguchi reservoirs decreased greatly last week, and the bottom of the lake is like a desert. All housewives have reduced their water consumption from 600,000 tons to 480,000 tons after being called upon by the authorities. In addition to reducing consumption, the authorities are also trying to increase supply in order to obtain new relief from other places. However, there is still a shortage of 160,000 tons of water every day. (United Press dispatch from the 23rd)

### Lack of Doctors in Japanese Villages

Tokyo: According to a report announced by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare, there are 3,600 villages in Japan with a total population of 10 million, but there is not a single resident doctor. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, village doctors have tended to practice in profitable towns, resulting in a lack of village doctors. Newly graduated students from medical universities are not interested in the profession of village doctor because they spend a lot of money and time studying. They claim that they will lose more than they gain if they return to their hometowns after graduation. The total number of doctors in Japan in 1938 was 62,934, of which 51,837 were self-employed. The others worked in government and school institutions. The total number of doctors in 1938 was 2,500 less than in 1937. (United Press dispatch from the 23rd)

### Construction of Large Sluice Gates in French Vietnam Will Greatly Increase Cultivated Land

Paris Airmail: A large sluice gate being built by French Vietnam at the confluence of the Dai River and the Red River is nearing completion. From now on, 125,000 acres of barren land that it is still seeking to reclaim can be used for cultivation. The rice yield is expected to increase by 200,000 tons per year, worth about 2.5 million Vietnamese piastres. Because that vast barren land has always been flooded during the rainy season in summer when the Red River is in full spate, and suffers from dryness in winter. Once the sluice gate is completed, excess water can be drawn off in summer and river water can be used for irrigation in winter. The convenience is obvious. The construction cost of this water conservancy project totals 60 million French francs. The materials used include 31,000 tons of cement, 2,000 tons of steel bars, 57,000 truckloads of soil, and 105,000 cubic feet of stone blocks, for a total of 1.08 million cubic feet of dikes and embankments, and 20,000 workers. It is so great. This project is only a part of the economic development plan of Vietnam. Since its implementation, the area of rice fields in Vietnam has expanded from 1.73 million acres in 1890 to 6.175 million acres (Havas dispatch from the 22nd).

### Establishment of Sichuan Provincial Library: Purchase of More Than 20,000 New Books Open Day and Night

(Chengdu Airmail) The Sichuan Provincial Library, previously actively prepared by Mr. Guo, Director of Education, who hired Mr. Yue Liangmu and Cao Zubin at the site of the Zhongcheng Elementary School on Chenshou Street for three months, has been roughly completed. The opening ceremony was held at 10:00 a.m. on April 10. Those who attended included Mr. Dai, President of the Examination Yuan, Mr. Liu Dongfu, representative of Director Deng of the Pacification Headquarters, Mr. Jiang Fu, Director of the Central Library, Mr. Guo Youshou, Director of the Education Department, Mr. Chen Zhushan, Director of the Construction Department, Mr. Hua Guojun, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts of Jinling University, and other officials from various institutions and guests from all walks of life, more than 200 people. Mr. Guo, Director of the Education Department, presided over the meeting and reported on the origin and preparation process, saying that although a library was established in this province in the early years of the Republic of China, it was small in scale and was transferred to the municipal government due to the provincial funds being insufficient. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, in view of the need for library undertakings, the provincial government made a resolution to establish a provincial library. However, it seemed that the war of resistance was in full swing and the progress was halted. After I came to the Education Department, I considered this matter to be of great importance to the culture of the entire province, so I began to prepare in January of this year. Fortunately, the local people enthusiastically supported it, and the colleagues in the library worked hard. More than 20,000 new books, more than 100 kinds of magazines, and 40 to 50 kinds of daily newspapers were purchased within three months. In addition, Mr. Dai, President of the Examination Yuan, and Director Deng each gave special donations of Chinese books. The Wartime Book Collection Committee and the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board each donated Western books, which shows the enthusiasm of the officials and academic circles for protecting the cultural undertakings of this province. I believe that Sichuan Province has a very deep and long history of culture. Woodcut printing enjoyed a high reputation in the Tang and Song dynasties. Today, most of the book carvings in the country have been lost due to the war, but Sichuan is the only one that is complete, which is enough to be proud of. I hope that the colleagues in the libraries of this province can receive instructions and strive to shoulder the great task of promoting the culture of Sichuan Province. Then, Mr. Dai, President of the Examination Yuan, delivered a speech, saying that I was supposed to rest for a while because I felt left out of the opening ceremony of the Sichuan Library. However, because today's ceremony is a major event, I came to participate. I have always been concerned about books and libraries, because my family was poor when I was young and it was not easy to buy books. At that time, there were very few collections of books in Sichuan, so I took care to preserve even one book when I was young. I used to read late at night and never stopped. When I studied in Japan, I often stood in bookstores and read all day long. This developed a habit of regarding books as treasures and knowing that it is not easy for ordinary people to read. Over the years, private individuals have specially donated books to establish libraries, totaling nine, with about 300,000 volumes. As for my feelings about libraries, I think that the value of a book lies in the fact that someone reads it. What is the point of collecting books if you do not read them? I have observed that some libraries are seriously managed and always hope that people will read them, while some bad libraries bind and hide books and do not allow people to read them at all, which is very regrettable. Although Sichuan's book carvings are less than other bureaus, the proofreading is very accurate. Now, most of the other bureaus have been damaged. I hope everyone will work hard to collect, promote carving and printing, and cultivate a reading atmosphere. Sichuan's culture has always been very prosperous, and the people are very skillful. After the establishment of the provincial library, it will be able to further promote culture and benefit the people. Finally, Mr. Cao Zubin, the director of the library, gave a reply, briefly describing the plan for this year's undertakings, hoping to do his best to live up to the expectations of all the gentlemen. Starting from the 10th, the reading rooms for books, magazines and newspapers will also be fully open at night.

### Overview of Adult Education Year Implementation in Guizhou Province (2)

(3) Characteristics of the Plan The plan has four characteristics: 1. Taking the war of resistance and nation-building as the center, the implementation of the Adult Education Year only takes popularizing education and eliminating illiteracy as a means, and takes "strengthening the mobilization of the masses and developing the power of the war of resistance and nation-building" as the goal. Therefore, the goal of the plan is to strengthen its national consciousness, inspire its patriotic enthusiasm, and firmly establish its belief in the victory of the war of resistance and the success of nation-building in spirit, and to enhance its essential skills during the war of resistance in life. All courses, teaching materials, teaching and guidance take the war of resistance and nation-building as its axis. 2. Using political power to promote it, the political style of this province is that all constructions are implemented by order. The law education order is also ordered by the government, directly from the city to the townships and villages. The implementation of the Adult Education Year still follows this style and uses political power as a promotion. 3. Mobilizing social forces to promote the implementation of the Adult Education Year is not a unilateral responsibility of educators or basic schools, but mobilizing the province's intellectuals, civil servants, party and government cultural institutions and groups to concentrate their efforts to promote it. 4. Coordinating with the requirements of basic education, the fundamental requirement of national basic education is to adapt education to life. Therefore, the plan emphasizes the three aspects of education content: political training, literacy training, and life training, in order to coordinate the integrity of life. In terms of teaching methods, it emphasizes social activities to adapt to the needs of actual life. In terms of the educational process, it formulates continuing education methods to prepare for further progress.

(3) Implementation Organization

In order to seek advice and cooperate in the implementation, the implementation plan stipulates that provincial and county adult education year promotion committees should be set up to be responsible for the design and promotion of all facilities for the adult education year. As for all implementation matters, the provincial government and the county government shall issue orders separately. The organization and work of the provincial and county adult education year promotion committees are described as follows:

The ex officio members are the Director of the Education Department, one representative of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Department, one representative of the Provincial Assembly, the Chief Secretary of the Education Department, and the chiefs of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Sections. The four appointed members are appointed by the provincial government, and the Director of the Education Department serves as the chairman of the committee.

Under it, there are three groups for design, training, and compilation and review, which are responsible for design, training, supervision and review, etc. Each group has one director, who is appointed by the Director of the Education Department from the original staff of the 3rd section of the Education Department. The Provincial Promotion Committee was formally established on February 8 and held its first meeting. After that, regular meetings were held on schedule. In early May, when Secretary Chen Lijiang of the Ministry of Education visited and inspected adult education in Guizhou, a special meeting was held to invite Secretary Chen to attend and give guidance. In addition to compiling and publishing the Adult Education Weekly and selecting teaching materials and other design work for various subjects, the important regulations passed by the Provincial Promotion Committee at various meetings are as follows:

(1) Detailed rules for the work of each group of this committee, (2) Detailed rules for the work of the adult education year promotion committees in various counties, (3) Implementation methods for adult education classes with certificates, (4) Provisional measures for adult education for special ethnic groups in Guangxi, (5) Outline of the work plan of each group of this committee, (6) Teaching methods for adult education classes on a weekly basis, (7) Outline of regional inspection of the adult education year in Guangxi Province, (8) Outline of inspection of the adult education year in various counties, (9) Methods for holding phased review meetings on adult education in various counties,

### Securities: Foreign Stocks Stir Up a Rebound, Wheelock Marden Shares Once Fell by Fifty Dollars; Rumors of Phone Price Hikes Cause Stocks to Soar

The prices of various stocks at the Public Securities Exchange, due to the concentration of Chinese and foreign speculators, have experienced sudden rises and falls, which are not favored by those with calm minds. They believe that the rubber boom is a recent lesson, and to jump into the whirlpool is to invite misfortune. This saying is indeed somewhat true. Currently, there is an excess of speculative capital in Shanghai, and the value of the legal tender has fallen. Being conservative means falling behind. Speculation has become a widespread trend, which cannot be suppressed by superficial talk. However, speculation is permissible, but it must be based on knowing the right time. Simply following blindly will inevitably lead to small gains not compensating for large losses. Recently, various stocks have experienced large rises and falls again. Those who do not understand think that there are many dark secrets. In fact, there are quite reasonable reasons for this, but speculators are taking advantage of them. A brief description of the general situation is as follows:

The most violent of these storms was undoubtedly the Wheelock Marden share. With a face value of ten taels, the highest price reached two hundred and seventy-two yuan. Yesterday, it fell tens of yuan. The reason for the increase was that each old share had the right to subscribe for a new share at a price of twenty-five yuan. However, the increase was too rapid and excessive, which led to widespread selling and a sudden decrease. Jardine Matheson has a connected relationship with Wheelock Marden. Market prices in investment and speculation clusters have caused a great uproar. This belongs to the shipping and dock stock category.

Jardine Matheson Textile shares have a face value of five taels. Last winter, the market price was seventeen or eighteen yuan. Recently, it has reached seventy-three or seventy-four yuan. The reason for this is that its inventory of raw materials is both large and cheap. Based on the current yarn price, each piece can earn four hundred yuan. Its coarse cloth is one yuan higher per piece than other factories, and its fine cloth is two yuan higher than East China goods. Moreover, its goods can travel unhindered to both guerrilla areas and occupied areas. This belongs to the textile industry stock category.

The market prices of International Trust shares, Yangtze Bank shares, and Shanghai Bank shares have also soared. This is because International Trust owns 25,000 shares of Wheelock Marden, Shanghai Bank has the most shares in China Land Reclamation, and Yangtze Bank is associated with them, so it also increased with the market. This belongs to the financial industry.

業廣 has a face value of five taels, and 中国营业 has a face value of ten yuan. Their upward trend is due to the recent increase in land prices by more than 20%, and the increase in building materials by several times. The Shanghai Municipal Council stipulates that from July, donations will be increased by 50%. Real estate developers can satisfy their desire to increase rents, so some investment attention is focused on this. This belongs to the real estate stock category.

As for other stocks, such as China Land Reclamation, its Mentougou coal mine has resumed normal coal production, and the stock price has increased with the coal price. Various rubber stocks previously fell sharply because the Netherlands was inevitably involved in the war. Recently, they have rebounded because Japan has taken the same attitude as the United States towards the Dutch East Indies, and there is still hope for the future. However, only seven types are related to the Netherlands: 英达区, 英楂华, 克罗华, 楂华康沙, 兰格志, 苏门答腊橡皮, etc. This must be known.

Yesterday, telephone stocks soared to a new high of forty yuan because the May telephone bills were delayed, and rumors spread that the telephone company would raise prices starting in May. The Shanghai telephone business has also developed abnormally along with speculation. Areas such as (1), (3), (7), (8), and (9) cannot be installed even if desired, resulting in transfer fees. Advertisements seeking them are sometimes seen in the newspaper, with some claiming as high as one thousand yuan or seven or eight hundred yuan, which has led to rumors of telephone price increases. In fact, commercial telephones certainly have different functions, while residential telephones are in a different situation.

In general, the assets of each stock company have increased with the market price, and all stocks made by the Public Securities Exchange can be used as collateral at HSBC. This is the largest outlet for speculators. However, doing business against Jewish merchants is extremely difficult, as their methods are infinitely subtle, and the Chinese are probably not their match. It is better to be cautious and not pursue the current temporary gains. This is also something to pay attention to. (Star)

Yesterday, the attitude of the operators of the Public Securities Market suddenly changed, so the general price was keenly corrected. The number of transactions was incredibly large, and the convenient methods frequently implemented by the exchange were used to the greatest extent to match the seemingly tidal-like unlimited orders.

Wheelock Marden shares were constantly released yesterday, falling significantly. Compared with the highest price the day before, there was once a height difference of fifty yuan. At the close, buying increased and appetite improved. The final transaction price was two hundred and thirty-six yuan.

International, Shanghai, Yangtze, and other stocks, under the pressure of sellers, all closed at the lowest price of the day.

Although China Land Reclamation shares were also swept away by profit-taking, their resistance was stronger. The opening price fell from thirty yuan to twenty-eight yuan and a half, but the closing price returned to twenty-nine yuan, with very good buying interest.

Rubber stocks had extremely large transactions. Although the New York spot price trended lower, the price still rose more than it fell. Rubber Trust, Lan Ge Zhi, Kang Sha Lai Te Xing Pu Ji, Rubber Trust once saw a new high of fifteen yuan.

The securities gray market remained unimproved yesterday. Type C shares once saw a price of eight yuan three times, but still failed to stabilize. However, the decline was slightly stable, with a tendency to hover. It is feared that it will still not be easy to be optimistic this week, because the previous declines were due to the outflow of spot goods and small, not entirely due to bulls closing positions. Moreover, the money supply has not eased at all, and transactions by various households are sudden and temporary, mostly of a temporary nature, or simply exchanging one for another. For example, at No. 41, Type C was bought and Type D was sold in the morning, and Type C was bought and Type A was sold in the afternoon. Runli bought in the morning and sold out again in the afternoon. Lianyi sold in the morning and recovered in the afternoon. The rest were just sporadic scalping transactions. As a result, the decline continued by one to four cents. The total number of transactions was estimated to be about one million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock trading: fifty shares of the newly formed New New Company were traded at a price of eleven yuan. London, 22nd (Monday) telegram: Today, the listed market prices of various British Far East companies' stocks showed a slight decline. HSBC Bank shares each fell half a pound, with prices all at ninety-three and a half pounds. Guthrie rubber shares also fell six pence, with a price of eighteen shillings and three pence, unchanged.

London, 22nd (Monday) telegram: Today, the listed market prices of Chinese foreign debt remained calm. There were no changes in the upper and lower bonds.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Arbitrage Once Reached More Than Five Points

The gray market for foreign exchange, spot terms are loose, a good reason being that speculators on forward months have opened up swap deals, and bulls continue to release their positions. There are still many Chinese businessmen doing swaps and arbitrage. It is heard that someone has posted a US dollar triangle of 125, with the combined monthly interest rate actually being more than five points. In the afternoon, speculators on forward month US exchange still disgorged positions, the market situation is still stable, swap deals are slightly squeezed tighter, and transactions are not deserted.

### Buying Interest Dwindles: The Gold Market Deteriorates Daily

Yesterday, the spot gold gray market situation continued to be sluggish, and the potential for recovery remained difficult, because the exchange market continued to trend looser, and the unusually tight money supply, especially the interbank lending rate, reached as much as four points, which affected many retail investors. Many floating long positions sought to sell their goods, and it was also heard that foreign merchant banks were urgently demanding the redemption of gold collateral, with absolutely no possibility of continuing to do so. Those without real strength could only lament their helplessness, and as a result, buying interest in the gold market gradually dwindled. After the price was suppressed, it was difficult to rise. The entire day's transactions were about two thousand taels.

Spot gold falls fifty yuan weakly

Since the morning, the opening price per bar (ten taels) was still stable, initially the silver firm bought twenty taels from the gold firm, still at five thousand seven hundred and seventy yuan, with no change compared to the previous close. After opening, the foreign exchange slightly loosened, and gold firms and securities houses tended to disgorge, and at that time a certain money exchange firm also had a strong intention, disgorging a certain amount, and for a time the position suddenly felt surplus, falling to thirty-five yuan, the gold firm bought ten taels from the silver firm, for five thousand seven hundred and thirty-five yuan. Thereafter, a certain securities house changed from selling to buying, plus the silver firm continued to absorb, immediately rebounding fifteen yuan, the securities house bought thirty taels from the gold firm, for five thousand seven hundred and fifty yuan, until around eleven o'clock the selling wind revived, the general floating long positions, due to settlement relationships, closed their positions one after another, and those who bought in were few, falling thirty yuan, the gold firm sold fifty taels to the silver firm, for five thousand seven hundred and twenty yuan, at noon the selling wind slightly subsided, and pulled up ten yuan, the securities house bought ten taels from the gold firm, for five thousand seven hundred and thirty yuan. Near the close, the money exchange firm sold again, falling five yuan more, selling thirty taels to the silver firm for five thousand seven hundred and twenty-five yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, because those who had closed their floating long positions came back to buy in, the opening price was five yuan higher, the gold firm bought twenty taels from the money exchange firm, for five thousand seven hundred and thirty yuan, subsequently bought by the securities house and the silver firm, rising another ten yuan, the money exchange firm bought fifty taels from the silver firm, for five thousand seven hundred and forty yuan, after which the securities house reversed from buying to selling, and retail investors also sold, and so turned downward, the silver firm and the silver firm mutually traded twenty taels, giving way to five thousand seven hundred and twenty yuan, then the gold firm sold ten taels to the silver firm for five thousand seven hundred and twenty-two yuan as the evening closing price, as a result, the decline continued by forty-eight yuan compared to the previous day, the entire day fluctuating by fifty yuan.

Jewelry gold motionless all day

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops remained unchanged all day, Datongxing still suspended at five hundred eighty yuan, the same price as Xintongxing, with the buying price reduced by about fifteen yuan.

### Spot cash reached a high of 135 yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange remittances and bills decreased from high to low, with each ten yuan rising from one hundred and twenty yuan in the morning to as high as one hundred and thirty-five yuan, the peak for this year, seeing that the supply of spot cash was relatively abundant, and so sharply falling to ninety-five yuan, near noon rebounding to one hundred and five yuan, in the afternoon continuing to rise to one hundred and ten yuan, rebounding five yuan compared to the previous day, the Money Industry Association interbank lending rate, both morning and afternoon markets still hung at two corners, unchanged.

### The decline in Japanese notes intensifies

Yesterday, the British and American gold pounds closely followed the decline in gold prices, and there was no shortage of supply of British gold notes, and the trend of American gold notes was even softer, once retreating to sixteen yuan three corners three points, but the foreign exchange market was still flat, why did American gold notes repeatedly tend to decline? This proves that the recent money supply is tight, and those with goods are successively selling their goods in order to exchange them for legal tender and fund turnover. Hong Kong notes and notes from Annam and the Philippines all followed the downward trend, the supply of Japanese gold notes was increasingly abundant, and the market price felt increasingly unsustainable, retreating to one yuan two corners seven points in the evening market, Korean notes initially had an endless supply, once retreating to nine corners nine points four li, subsequently there was a slight need, and the evening market rebounded to one yuan, but still one point smaller than the previous day.

### Yarn and Cotton: Buying Sentiment Pervades, Cotton Yarn Prices Soar Sharply, But What About Actual Sales Being Dull?

The yarn market, which had been circling steadily for two days, reported another rise yesterday, and the increase was even more dramatic, because spot goods were dry and the trading floor was tight, so although actual sales to customers were not strong, the enthusiasm was even greater. In fact, the price of a certain country's yarn is strangely high, and the price of 20-count yarn in May has reached 1430-40 yuan in full cash, higher than our yarn, and so 20-count Double Horse yarn has been driven up.

Spot cash rose sharply for 20-count Double Horse, with buying sentiment pervasive and confidence very strong, opening immediately at a customs price of one thousand four hundred and five yuan, and an out-of-warehouse price of one thousand four hundred and twenty yuan, and in an instant, because there were many buyers, the market price directly trended higher to one thousand four hundred and fifty-four yuan, with the factory price at one thousand four hundred and forty-five yuan, and the closing price saw another increase. Upon investigation, half-day transaction statistics totalled one thousand nine hundred and fifteen bales, and the market price of 20-count Double Horse spot goods rose fifty-four yuan. Also, today (24th) there are one thousand two hundred and seventy-five pieces of cotton yarn being shipped to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each gang is listed below.

Fellow merchants: 1,810, Hong Kong 100

廈鬥: 5 Total: 1,915

### Factory Offices Activate, Raw Cotton Flourishes

Transactions in native cotton improved slightly, because yarn prices advanced step by step, causing interdependent raw cotton to flourish accordingly. At the same time, factory offices gradually showed signs of activity. The current cotton transaction situation is listed below:

Da Zhong Ji: 255.00, fellow merchant bought 300 bales

Huoji flower: 213.00, fellow merchant bought 200 bales

San Yu flower: 231.75, fellow merchant bought 80 bales

Omla: 234.00, fellow merchant bought 100 pieces

Pengjiapu: 254.00, Shenxin bought 100 pieces

Another report on the foreign cotton market: yesterday morning the New York cotton market, the other cotton markets were especially calm, and afterwards the market situation turned active, and a portion of short sellers covered, as a result the closing price, compared to the previous day, rose five to eight pounds per note, Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose two rupees per note, Egyptian cotton rose five or six pounds per note.

Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions were quieter yesterday, but selling prices were exceptionally high, but with money being unusually tight, factories had a strong buying intention, and fellow merchants were unwilling to be forced to sell cheaply, so transactions were quiet, but in general, the consensus was optimistic about cotton prices. The factory price for cotton yesterday, converted at an exchange rate of six yuan to the US dollar, is as follows:

20s US Mitlin: 295.50

20s also: Substandard 184.90

32s also: 312.60

32s also: Substandard 302.00

42s also: 315.50

42s also: Substandard 306.00

### Piece Goods: Hoarders Active, Cotton Cloth Continues to Rise

National cloth: yesterday the market started flat and then rose, attracting the need of this street, and hoarders also started to be active, but due to the tight money supply, a portion of cargo owners were also willing to unload along with the market, so the morning market was flat, and then with constant demand, sentiment turned firm, and prices rose step by step, as a result, coarse cloth and fine twill each rose five corners to one yuan per piece, coarse cloth rose two corners and a half to seven corners and a half, bleached cloth rose by varying amounts, about one yuan or so, this street transacted more than one thousand pieces of various goods, Cantonese merchants handled nearly two hundred pieces of dyed cloth, colored twill, and bleached cloth, Zhejiang and Fujian merchants handled three hundred plus pieces of bleached cloth, fine cloth, and coarse cloth, and Yanjing merchants handled more than ten thousand pieces of blue cloth, bleached cloth, pongee, foreign yarn, etc.

Eastern cloth: with the yarn price continuing to rise, merchants from the north continued to handle purchases actively, and fellow merchants and hoarders on this street also continued to search, so the rising trend was even more fierce, with the highest spot price for Longtou fine cloth reaching forty-six yuan seven corners and a half, and the futures price forty-eight yuan seven corners and a half, and the closing price slightly lower, with the current selling price at forty-six yuan four corners and the futures price at forty-eight yuan five corners, and the listed price for 叫君子哔叽 one yuan four corners three points and a half, and next month one yuan five corners three points, although the distance between the futures prices is far, buyers are happy to absorb them, showing the tight market sentiment, and the money supply remains tight.

Exports: today (24th) there are 535 pieces of cotton cloth being shipped to Hong Kong, and another 85 pieces being shipped to Singapore.

Imports: yesterday there were 18 pieces of cloth coming to Shanghai from Wenzhou.

### The Grain and Rice Market Finally Stabilizes, Japonica Rice Arrivals Still Strong

Yesterday's rice market was entirely dependent on the amount of goods in the market, the coldness or heat of sales, and the willingness of those holding goods to sell, and so goods such as No. 1 Chen Saigon and Broken Point Rice Tea remained steady, while the rest, continuing the previous soft trend, were all illusory. The early market sales floor was small, and there was also a lot of recoiling, so the market price immediately depreciated by half a yuan, and so fire-cracked rice only sold for around 44 yuan and a half, No. 2 Saigon 43 yuan and a half, small fire-cracked rice 42 yuan and a half, and those acting with strategy all took advantage of the cheap prices to buy in, and the market price once rebounded, seeing a return to the original price, but ultimately lacking real sales, it immediately declined again, and as a result the closing prices were all shorter by about half a yuan compared to the previous market.

After thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice sources were cleared, and daily arrivals occurred, sentiment was not as firm as before, and yesterday another one thousand four or five hundred bags of japonica rice from Changzhou and other places and light rice from Qingsi, Nanhang early and late rice, etc., arrived at the port, and Shanghai stocks gradually increased, and it was heard that the gray market outside the floor was sparse and abnormal, prices falling by seven or eight corners to one yuan or so, with Wuxi clear japonica at 44 yuan eight corners, 44 yuan and a half, Changzhou clear japonica 44 yuan, powdered japonica 43 yuan, and Su Kun white japonica only 43-44 yuan, Qingsi special light rice 45 yuan, medium grade 43-44 yuan, and Nanhang early and late rice 42-43 yuan, and lower grade 41 yuan, the route for glutinous rice was also more relaxed, but the price level was cheap alone, and cargo owners were unwilling to sell lightly, so although the market was soft, there was no significant change in the selling price, with only the median seeing a depreciation of three to five corners.

The foreign rice market was soft again yesterday, after the opening of the morning market domestic rice from various routes arrived one after another, and foreign rice orders and goods from Hong Kong also flowed in continuously, and floating households and retail customers, due to the tight money supply, all sought to sell late in the market, and those gaining profits also urgently sought to sell, and so current rice prices from all grades universally depreciated, especially small fire-cracked rice declined more violently, once falling to within 42 yuan and a half, and then with the price decline causing a reduction in selling, it rose again to 43 yuan, but in the afternoon it saw a decline again, recoiling No. 2 Saigon, April-May opened at 54 yuan two corners and a half and two corners in the morning, and the lowest shrunk to 514 yuan in the afternoon, the close saw some floating short positions cover and rebounded one corner, the unified rolling model futures opened at two hundred and fifty or sixty tons, with current foreign rice at five thousand bags.

### Flour and Wheat Transactions Quiet

Flour: Yesterday's transactions, because exports have been controlled by Japanese forces, and retail customers are unwilling to buy more due to the increasing heat, and those being directly sold by manufacturers leaving the factory for the unified market are fewer than five thousand bags. After rebounding once, the buying from hoarders turned sluggish yesterday, and prices were invisibly loose and chaotic, and it was heard that Lao Chepai opened at 13 yuan seven corners five or six points, with the factory price differing by a small number of points, and other Japanese-owned factories in the inland were only shouting prices, and there were no formal transactions.

Wheat: Yesterday's market transactions were also clear, because exports are currently stagnant, and Japanese factories lack the desire to buy, although some Chinese factories are selectively approaching, eating is particularly cautious, while those holding goods still seek to struggle, resulting in a deadlock on both sides, and it was heard that the price for goods being sent to the factory continued to open at 20 yuan zero eight corners and a half to six corners and a half.

### Oil Market: Raw Soybean Oil Rebounds by One or Two Yuan

Yesterday's raw soybean oil market, first inheriting the sluggishness of the previous day, the market was listless, and afterwards, because soybeans continued to flourish, and the bottom accumulation of basket soybean oil was loose, and the barrelled oil that arrived contained excessive water, causing disputes, and for a time there was a sense that goods should not be on the market, and sentiment took the opportunity to activate, and peanut oil also raised one or two yuan as a result, but the number of transactions was not large, and only one hundred pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were opened in total, price: foreign market price column, ninety barrels of Qingdao raw oil, one hundred cans of Jiangbei Menzhuang raw oil, five hundred cans of Yantai raw oil, twenty barrels of Dalian soybean oil, one hundred pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, one hundred pieces of Qingqi soybean oil, one hundred and fifty pieces of Yanqi soybean oil, and four hundred dan of Dayou factory soybean oil.

### Sugar Market: Both Cart and Coarse Sugar Loosen

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to loosen. Public and longevity brands, and second-grade coarse white sugar spot goods, new goods were priced at 64.40 to 64.30 yuan, a slight decrease of 0.30 yuan; old goods were at 64.05 yuan, down approximately 0.35 yuan. Taikoo cart white B mark from the Western depot was priced at 71.40 yuan, a slight decrease of 0.20 yuan; old goods were at 71 yuan, with the lower grade refunded accordingly. H mark cart red sugar remained at 51 yuan, while Dutch red sugar spot goods were at 54 yuan, an increase of 0.25 yuan. Re-exported goods included 240 packages of Zhangzhou Diaoging, priced at 51.50 yuan.

### Rumors of a "Special Police Force" Being Established: Tax Issues Difficult to Resolve. The So-Called "Maturity" is Not Optimistic. When Will the "Bad Soil" Be Peaceful? Unforeseen Developments.

The establishment of the "Special Police Force" for road construction beyond the boundaries, since the signing of the "Police Affairs Agreement" between the Municipal Council and the puppet regime in February, although there has been a trend towards imminent implementation, it has been delayed until now, with the opinions of both parties not entirely consistent, and no results. On the 18th of this month, the Chief Superintendent of the Municipal Council, Mr. Bowen, officially announced that the "Special Police Force" would be announced within the last three weeks. He also stated that the Municipal Council and the puppet regime would respectively send Mr. Bowen, Mr. Lu Ying, and Colonel Igarashi Tsutomu as representatives to discuss the matter again in Hongkou on the afternoon of the 19th. However, neither party has made any further announcements about the outcome, and there is no further news.

Repeated Talks Seem to Be Maturing

Until yesterday, authoritative sources revealed that the organization of the "Special Police Force" is expected to be established soon, and that the negotiations between the two parties have reached a very harmonious level. However, the economic issue has not yet been resolved satisfactorily. After this news was released, it was confirmed by Mr. Chu Ch'ien-an, who said that although it is still impossible to say when the "Special Police Force" will be established, it is believed that the matter has reached a mature stage and that results will be achieved in the near future.

Personnel Selection and Organization Have Been Internally Determined

It is also rumored that the "Special Police Force" may be established in the middle of next month. The personnel will still be dispatched by both parties and mutually agreed upon. Currently, the personnel have been assigned, but officials believe that it is not yet time to announce them. The details of the organization have also been drafted, but further discussions are needed and the plan must be approved by both parties before it can be implemented.

Tax Disputes Are Difficult to Resolve

The unresolved issue is the tax issue. It is rumored that the puppet regime has requested the Municipal Council to consider and resolve it as soon as possible. The Municipal Council's response is that this issue must be submitted for discussion after the new board of directors takes office. The tax issue is the focus of the road construction issue beyond the boundaries. According to general observations, the Municipal Council's economic situation is currently not stable, and the issue of tax collection for road construction beyond the boundaries will inevitably be disputed by both parties, and it is unlikely that a consensus can be reached in the short term. Therefore, the statement that the "Special Police Force" is about to be established is not necessarily optimistic.

The Hotbed of Crime Is About to Relocate

The North-China Daily News stated that the cargo and freight sector recently indicated that the West District Police Department, established under the temporary agreement between the Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government," is expected to be established in the middle of next month. The negotiations are progressing smoothly, but the financial issue still needs to be resolved. The address of the new police station and the new police chief have been selected. It is said that the casinos and opium dens in the area will be closed at that time. Those who operate gambling and opium businesses have tried their best to lobby, but to no avail. Therefore, they will close or relocate elsewhere in the middle of next month. As for the financial issues of the new police district, the Municipal Council stated that it must wait for the new board of directors to decide. The Shanghai Times also stated that the Japanese-language Continental News had reported that the West District Special Police Force would be established in mid-May. Last night, the reporter asked Major Bowen, the head of the Municipal Council's Police Department, about this, and he claimed to be unaware of it and did not know when the team would be established, as the establishment date had not been determined. Both parties are still planning and it is not yet known when they will be ready.

### Shanghai Post Office: Facing Difficulties

It Is Heard That Zha Pei Went to Ningbo and Had Some Contact

According to the Datong News Agency, the environment of the Shanghai Post Office has become increasingly difficult since the establishment of the so-called "new organization" in Nanjing. Mr. Zha Pei Lin, the Shanghai Postmaster, recently went to Ningbo, in addition to inspecting the postal affairs in the Nanjing area, and had considerable contact with Wang Xianghou, the so-called "Postal Director of the New Organization." This kind of contact may be a compromise for maintaining postal rights, but it is sufficient to show the increasing difficulties of the Shanghai Post Office. As for the administrative affairs of the bureau, there have been no changes so far. Everything is carried out in accordance with the orders of the Kunming Postal Administration.

### The Dredging Bureau: The Situation Is Complicated

The Confiscated Ships Are Not Returned The Japanese Side Only Works for Its Own Benefit

According to the Datong News Agency, the resumption of dredging work by the Shanghai Dredging Bureau is extremely far from the actual start date. According to a senior customs official, the dredging vessels and survey vessels confiscated by the Japanese side have not been returned by the Japanese side, except for a very small number. It has been found that the Japanese side has sent its own personnel to places such as Gaoqiao and Yangshupu to facilitate its own work, and the Zhang Huabang shipyard, which has been destroyed, has not yet been returned. Moreover, since the bureau was forced to reorganize, the power of Japanese personnel has surpassed that of Chinese and Western personnel. In other words, Chinese and Western staff are only for reserve purposes. The rumors that the dredging work will begin in early May, according to his observations, may not be true.

### The May 1st Holiday is Approaching: The Labor Community Prepares to Commemorate

The International Labor Day on May 1st is approaching. The labor community in Shanghai has always celebrated this holiday. Given the extraordinary times and the special environment of Shanghai, it has been decided not to take extravagant forms or hold any gatherings. However, in order to commemorate Labor Day and celebrate with workers around the world, it has been decided to take a day off as usual on that day. At the same time, in order to promote the meaning of labor, the labor unions of various industries have decided to instruct their members to emulate the spirit of international workers' struggle, wage a death-defying war against the current harsh environment, and vow to support the national policy of resistance against Japan, striving for the final victory in order to obtain the true liberation, freedom, and equality of Chinese workers. According to the Dagang News Agency, the police authorities of the two concessions have decided to take joint precautions due to the large number of commemorative holidays in May to ensure order within the boundaries and maintain public peace.

### Resignation of Japanese Director Tian Cheng of the Shanghai Municipal Council; Japanese Side Hopes Okamoto Ikkaku Will Fill the Vacancy, But According to Regulations, It Must Be Elected by the Board of Directors

Following the election of Tian Cheng as a Japanese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council this term, rumors immediately spread that he intended to resign. Yesterday, the Tokyo branch of the Domei News Agency confirmed this via telegram. It is noted that Tian Cheng has been residing in the East Hospital for the past few weeks, and he was unable to attend the inauguration of the entire board of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council on the 18th. Local Japanese sources claimed that Tian Cheng had no intention of assuming office, and the vacancy should be filled by Okamoto Ikkaku, the Japanese director who lost to Tian Cheng by two votes in the election.

Okamoto Ikkaku to Fill the Position. According to a Tokyo dispatch from the Domei News Agency yesterday, Tian Cheng intended for Okamoto to become a Japanese director and had therefore resigned voluntarily, because he felt that Okamoto was a talent in diplomacy and an expert familiar with Chinese affairs. He also knew that Okamoto had left the diplomatic world to become a candidate for the position of director of the Shanghai Municipal Council. In the past, Okamoto was the

Japanese Consul-General in Singapore. Okamoto is currently the director of the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China and was also one of the Japanese directors of the previous Shanghai Municipal Council. Before the recent board of directors election, the Japanese side suddenly put forward five candidates and made arrangements in advance, attempting to have all five elected in order to break the established rule of the Shanghai Municipal Council's ratio of five British and American directors to two Japanese directors. Thus, Okamoto Ikkaku and Hanawa Yūtarō, the two former directors, as well as the three newly elected directors, could all be included. Unexpectedly, the

Election Results showed that the Japanese attempt completely failed, maintaining the original state of two Japanese directors. Even more unexpectedly, Hanawa Yūtarō was re-elected, while Okamoto failed. However, the "Deputy Director of the China Railway Company," who was not very familiar with the situation in Shanghai, entered the board of directors with two more votes. At a time when the Japanese community in this city was

Tense Regarding Relations with the International Settlement, those in the know expected that, given his qualifications, it would be difficult for him to settle into the position. However, according to the rules of the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors, if a director's position becomes vacant during the year, it should be filled by other directors. Therefore, after Tian Cheng's resignation, the same procedure should be followed. What the Japanese side said, that Okamoto Ikkaku, who lost the election by two votes, would automatically fill the position, is completely

Unclear on the Rules. However, it is understood that if the Japanese side hopes that Okamoto Ikkaku will be appointed to fill Tian Cheng's vacancy, then the other directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council will accept their intention when discussing the matter at the meeting. This point is entirely a matter of procedure. As for the Japanese side's explanation of succession, it does not conform to the facts. It is also understood that after Tian Cheng's vacancy, it is impossible to elect another British or American director to fill it.

Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors to Elect Committee Members Next Week

The Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors has decided to produce a list of candidates for committees on the economy, personnel, music, police affairs, and film censorship at next week's meeting.

### British Community Celebrates St. George's Day Yesterday

Wreaths Placed Before the Statue of Peace; the 2nd Battalion of the East Yorkshire Regiment Celebrates the Battle of Ypres

According to the English-language *North China Daily News*, the British community in Shanghai commemorated St. George's Day today (the 23rd). At 8:30 AM, a wreath-laying ceremony was held in front of the Statue of Peace on the Bund, with a brief speech by Reverend Quili Fanter, President of the Shanghai Branch of the British St. George's Society, and the wreath was laid by Vice President Raynal. Several British troops also participated. From 7:45 PM to 9:49 PM tonight, members and friends of the 　　治　Society will attend a private screening of the film "有　之　" at the Cathay Theatre. After the 　, an informal banquet and dance will be held at the French 　Society. In addition, the 2nd Battalion of the East Yorkshire Regiment of the British Army stationed in Shanghai celebrated the Battle of Ypres today with a banquet and free films. Ypres is a town in Belgium, held by the British Army during the World War until the end of the European conflict. Three major battles took place there, especially the fierce battle of April 23, 1915, during the Second Battle of Ypres.

### National Government Commends Fan Keling

Mr. Fan Keling, the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, received a Chinese official document yesterday morning, which was shaped like a diploma and stamped with a vermilion official seal. After the office translated and explained it, it was learned that it was a certificate of commendation distributed to Mr. Fan by the National Government. Mr. Fan expressed his deep satisfaction with this, because he had not received this honor before. The certificate of commendation was sent to Shanghai from Chongqing and signed by Mr. Kong Xiangxi, the former President of the Executive Yuan. The certificate stated that the National Government highly commended Mr. Fan Keling's disaster relief work and his enthusiasm for public welfare.

### Abe Has Indeed Arrived in Nanjing

It has now been confirmed that Abe Nobuyuki passed through Shanghai on the Kashima Maru at noon on the 21st. The ship was designated to dock at the mouth of the Huangpu River, and all passengers arriving in Shanghai disembarked there, without stopping at the Huishan Wharf. At 5:00 PM, it set sail for Nanjing. The ship is currently still in Nanjing and is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 25th and depart for Japan on the 26th.

### Forced Payment of Accounts at the End of April; Hoarders Emerge One After Another; Banks and Money Shops Refuse Long-Term Loans on Daily Necessities; Increased Warehouse Rents and Discount Rates Push Hoarders to Their Doom

With the April deadline approaching for various industries in Shanghai, banks and money shops are strictly refusing loans to hoarders, making it difficult to turn around their finances. Businesses and shops are vigorously demanding payment of debts, and the rents of Chinese and foreign warehouses are also limited to increased payment in proportion. All hoarders are forced to sell their hoarded goods. The details of each situation are explored below.

Refusal to Turn Over Funds. After the war, the loan operations of all member banks and money shops affiliated with the Banking Association and the Money Shop Association are implemented in accordance with the financial and economic measures of the four banks, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank, to adjust Shanghai's finances. Legitimate loans for all industries and businesses, any application that is deemed unqualified or considered an illegitimate loan, will be refused. Currently, all banks and money shops have already investigated the details of all speculators and hoarders among their clients. Many are facing this difficult situation at the end of April. Amidst the repeated demands for payment of hoarded goods from businesses and shops, they have tried every means to negotiate loans from various banks and shops, but all have been strictly rejected. The goal is to avoid providing funds to turn over, to overcome this major difficulty. All hoarders are extremely worried.

Forced to Sell Goods. The price of goods in Shanghai has risen this time, hoarders are blinded by profit, and most of the goods they have taken in are food, daily necessities, and European and American goods. Since they were piled into Chinese and foreign warehouses, they have gained extremely high profits from the rising prices of goods. Only seeking profit, they do not care for the people's livelihood. For a long time, they have been unwilling to sell. Since the establishment of the flat price associations in the two concessions, hoarders have rushed to sell. Causing the goods of larger hoarders to be ignored, piled up in warehouses, and warehouse rents continue to increase. Now that these hoarders have no access to loans, and their debts are forced to be paid, they have no choice but to take out their hoarded goods for sale, seeking to overcome the difficult pass of settling accounts at the end of April. It is heard that in recent days, the trend of discounting in the financial market has been great, and the discount rate has been arbitrarily increased to 240 yuan, almost enough to put the hoarders to death.

### US Navy Summer Northern Patrol to Join the Fleet; Thirteenth and Fourteenth Squadrons Will Join, Command Flag Changed to the USS Augusta; Commissioner Sayre to Go to Japan Next Sunday

The flagship USS Augusta of the US Asiatic Fleet, carrying US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, arrived in Shanghai at 11:30 AM on the 22nd. After arriving in Shanghai, it is now berthed at the British naval pontoon. Although the ship was damaged after hitting a reef in Coron Bay in the Philippine Islands, the damage was not serious. After repairs, there is no need for further inspection. Therefore, the four-star command flag of the US Asiatic Fleet was changed from Admiral Hart's private yacht, the USS Isabel, to the

USS Augusta. The USS Isabel is now moored west of the flagship. According to a reporter from the *New Voice News*, the USS Augusta must remain in Shanghai for one month before heading north to join the annual summer patrol. According to US Navy Department news, before the end of this month, the US protection ship USS Black Hawk and the US transport ship USS Marblehead will arrive in Shanghai one after another. The number of ships joining the patrol this year has not been confirmed, but it is heard that the US Destroyer Squadron Thirteenth, the USS Alden, USS Edwards, USS Barker, USS Whipple, and the USS Fourteenth Squadron, the USS Parrott, USS Stewart, USS Edsall, and USS Baltimore, eight ships in total, may

Come North to join. Admiral Hart spent a considerable amount of time in Shanghai and is scheduled to go to Qingdao and Yantai at the beginning of next month. As for Commissioner Sayre's arrival, it is purely to meet Ambassador Grew in Japan. Mr. Sayre told reporters that he very much wanted to meet Ambassador Johnson, but Ambassador Johnson had already gone to Chongqing a month ago. Mr. Sayre met with Admiral Hart, Major General Grassford, and US diplomatic officials in Shanghai yesterday. Mr. Sayre is scheduled to go to Kobe and then to Tokyo next Sunday.

### Old Goods, Copper, and Tin Guild Holds Talk Yesterday

### Far Eastern Countries Unanimously Support the Moral Re-Armament

Conference Held in Rangoon, All Ports in China Participate

The Far Eastern Moral Re-Armament Conference will be held in Rangoon, Burma, next month. The conference will last ten days, from May 9th to May 18th. Countries in the Far East, such as the United States, Japan, India, Siam, the Philippines, and various parts of Southeast Asia and Australia, have sent representatives to participate. The purpose of the conference is to awaken people to do their best with conscience and ability, remove prejudice, unite with integrity, and establish a true foundation for world peace. On the Chinese side, in addition to the people in this city's movement who have already sent Mei Lide, Tang Minghe, and Yao Xisheng to participate, it is heard that Kunming and Chongqing also have representatives attending the conference. Burma has been promoting the Moral Re-Armament Movement in recent years. There is no effort that hasn't been made, and the conflicts between religions and ethnic groups in the country have been greatly reduced. The conference in Burma was initiated and convened by Ms. Manning Tai and others who came to Shanghai before. It is expected that the movement will be greatly promoted in the country and the Far East.

### Intentions for Opening the Pearl River are Unclear; Britain Will Not Resume Sailing for the Time Being; Taikoo, Jardine, and South China Line Liners Have No Plans to Go to Guangzhou

After the fall of Guangzhou, the Pearl River shipping was controlled by the Japanese army, and foreign ships suspended their voyages. However, Japanese ships still sailed as usual. Since the blockade, it has been almost a year and a half. Although the third country has repeatedly negotiated, it has not been effective. Although foreign ships cannot sail to Guangzhou, they are not subject to any losses for transporting new routes separately. Therefore, the problem of opening the Pearl River has not been valued recently. However, it was recently heard that the Pearl River was suddenly opened automatically last Saturday (20th), but its intention is unknown. However, the announced import and export goods have strict restrictions and must be applied for in advance, which is not easy to handle in terms of facts. If the plan remains the same, the loss of ship schedules will be huge. The South China Line liners of British companies Taikoo and Jardine in this city have no plans to go to Guangzhou. Therefore, the resumption of British ships on the Pearl River is under consideration, and it is feared that it will not be implemented this month.

### Domestic Mail; Recent Postal Routes; Shanghai Bureau Distributes Through 20 Routes

### After the Chinese Buddhist Association Moves to Chongqing, the Shanghai Office Closes

Because the Chinese Buddhist Association has moved its office to Chongqing, its Shanghai office on Hart Road has begun to close. The former president of the association, Venerable Yuanying, is still in Shanghai, but he is in Shanghai to lose things, is to the society to protect Chongqing, no company, so he has filed to quit all duties.

### Rickshaw Pullers in Nanshi Carry Out a General Strike

The 2,000 rickshaw pullers in Nanshi are currently on strike to protest against the increase in rickshaw rentals. After several days of stalemate, the matter has not been resolved. The striking rickshaw pullers have joined together to appeal to the pseudo "Social Affairs Bureau," but there is no hope of a solution at this time.

### Infectious Diseases are Rampant; Typhoid and Tuberculosis are Raging; Rumors Spread That a Theater is Spreading Typhus; Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department Explains

Since the beginning of spring in this city, various infectious diseases have been extremely prevalent. According to statistics from the knowledgeable and reasonable health department, during the past week, one foreigner and 37 Chinese died from typhoid fever, and tuberculosis is particularly rampant, with a very high mortality rate. Six foreigners and 78 Chinese died in the past week. In addition, three-day measles and other diseases are also extremely popular.

External Rumors

In view of the rumors that a certain theater is spreading epidemic typhus, the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department hereby declares the following: The reason for typhus is that it is transmitted from someone who has already been infected to others, and the transmission is due to flea and lice bites. Such fleas and lice must first come into contact with a person suffering from the disease, and the lice become infected with the germs, and then spread the infection from person to person. Therefore, the transmission of this disease must have direct contact with people who gather these fleas and lice before it can occur. There is no doubt. Fleas and lice reside in the human body and leave soon after, and the people who gather fleas and lice are unlikely to be theatergoers.

Opportunity for Infection

The opportunity for us to contract diseased fleas and lice when we bump into others while walking is actually greater than in the theater. Based on the above, it is unreliable to say that these kinds of fleas and lice exist in the theater because it once housed refugees. The refugee shelter in a certain theater was closed as far back as May of last year. The refugees had already been moved out, and the house had been rebuilt and renovated. The health department sent people to inspect it, and no fleas or lice were found. If we say that there are typhus infections in the theater and blame it on the former housing of refugees, it is impossible. The health department still pays close attention to the theaters in the concession at any time and checks for the occurrence of lice.

### Japanese Forces in Nanchang are Gradually Weakening

Japanese Military Spokesman Admits

At a press conference held by the Japanese military spokesman the day before yesterday, in addition to admitting the activity of guerrillas on the outskirts of Shanghai, he also admitted that there have been recent troop movements in Nanchang, and it is possible that the military strength in some places is gradually weakening. He 　, "This kind of transfer is entirely due to strategic relations."

### French Concession's Chinese and Vietnamese Police Burdens Lightened

The Police 　 Runs Inexpensive Rice, Which Both Chinese and Vietnamese Police Can Purchase

Commissioner of Police Fabre of the French Concession, in view of the extremely high price of rice in Shanghai, in order to reduce the burden on the police officers of the Chinese and Vietnamese police stations, issued Ordinance No. 16 yesterday, stating, "A large amount of Chinese japonica rice has been purchased. All Chinese and Vietnamese personnel of the Police Department who receive salaries included in the budget of the Shanghai Municipal Council may purchase three-quarters of a picul of rice at a price of 27 yuan and 40 cents per person. This rice will be distributed by Inspector General Gibie according to the following order: Béthune Police Station, Foch Police Station, Central Police Station, MacMahon Police Station, Joffre Police Station, Xiaodongmen Police Station Xujiahui District, Political Affairs Office, Motor Vehicle Department, Detective Office, Judicial Police, Garrison, Other Personnel. Mr. Gibie will put the rice assigned to each person into bags with a capacity of one-quarter of a picul, and deliver them to the chief or director of the responsible department. Therefore, every five people can get three bags of rice. The empty bags should be returned within three days after distribution. Each person should pay the rice price of 27 yuan and 40 cents, which the chief or director will deduct from their April salary on payday, and the deducted amount should be immediately sent to the secretary-general. Single Vietnamese personnel who dine in the canteen of this office should take necessary measures at each department, select a suitable place, and safely store the rice that should be allocated. Signed on April 23, 1940, Commissioner of Police Fabre.

### There is a Saying About the Norwegian Ship Sailing to the Far East Resuming Its Voyage

Largely Hopeful of Success; Awaiting Formal Orders

After the Danish and Norwegian countries in Northern Europe were invaded, the Danish and Norwegian ships sailing to the Far East concentrated in various ports one after another. It is now heard that the Norwegian ships in the Far East are still flying the Norwegian flag and resuming regular voyages to the Far East, it is said that when they are sailing. When navigation is restored in the future, the wartime navigation rules of Britain and France must be followed. As for Denmark, which has now fallen, it has not yet been announced whether its Far Eastern ships that are berthed at British ports will be allowed to sail again, and whether they will still fly the Danish flag or the Allied flag. The fact that Norwegian ships are about to resume sailing was confirmed by the British Embassy Office here yesterday. It is said that the current situation has been clarified, and it is generally hoped that Norwegian ships will resume sailing. An employee of the Tianxiang Foreign Company, which represents Norwegian ships, said that he had received the news, but it would not be implemented until formal orders from Hong Kong arrived.

### Dentist Robbed, Thief Arrested

On the morning of the 4th of this month, at 9:45 AM, the house of dentist Zhu Xie Tang, located at 176 Avenue Edward VII, was suddenly invaded by five armed bandits. They threatened with guns, searched and robbed for about an hour, taking away gold and silver jewelry, clothing, and cash, totaling about 9,072 yuan, and escaped with the stolen goods. The victim reported the case to the police for investigation. At 8:30 AM the day before yesterday, Zhu Liangjiang, a relative of Zhu Xie Tang, went to Hongkou on business and suddenly encountered Li Yifan, a Ningbo native who was one of the bandits in the case, at the intersection of Baoding Road and Huade Road. He followed him and saw Li enter his residence at No. 7, Lane 375, Baoding Road. He immediately reported to the Yulin Road Police Station, which sent Chinese detective Liu Chunshu and detective Peng Zhenxuan to arrest Li secretly. They confiscated a watch, a roll of silk, and 449 yuan and 40 cents in cash. Together with the suspects Yu Yichao, Shi Xingchun, and Xing Jiulin, they were imprisoned in the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case and requested a postponement. After questioning by Judge Xiao Peishen, he ordered the suspects to be detained for seven days for further investigation.

### Abductions Occur Frequently; Families Should Pay Close Attention; Women and Children Relief Association Issues a Serious Warning; Orders All Branches to Assist in Paying Attention

Since a large-scale abduction ring was uncovered in Hongkou, the matter has aroused great social attention. The police authorities are continuing to investigate and arrest criminals to completely eradicate them. The Children's Welfare Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Chinese Children's Welfare Association and other children's welfare agencies are also deeply concerned about this. The China Women and Children Relief Association in this city is an agency dedicated to rescuing and educating abducted women and children. Recently, due to frequent abduction cases, it has warned families to pay special attention to the care of their children. It also notified branches in various places to assist in paying attention. It is said that young boys and older girls are the most likely to be abducted. After being trafficked abroad, they are either given to people as adopted children or used as prostitutes to make huge profits. This kind of separation of family members is truly unconscionable. The association currently has more than 500 women and children in its care, who are abducted women and children over the years who have not been claimed by their families. Some of them were sent by various police stations.

### Gold Bars Confiscated on the New Beijing

When the British company Taikoo's ship New Beijing arrived in Tianjin from Shanghai last time, the customs confiscated a large number of smuggled gold and legal currency, totaling more than one million yuan. It is said that a certain second comprador of the ship has fled. The Beiyang Ban Lisheng of Jardine Matheson in this city was originally scheduled to leave Tianjin for Shanghai yesterday. According to a reporter from *Ping Ming News*, before the ship left Tianjin, customs officers suddenly confiscated a large number of Japanese currency (all old bills) worth about 40,000 yuan and a wooden barrel of silver dollars on the ship's cargo ship. The smugglers have fled without a trace, so the chief comprador, the second comprador, the boatswain, and the steward of the ship were taken away for strict interrogation. Therefore, the ship's arrival in Shanghai may be delayed.

### Chen Zhaoxi: Bigamy and Fraud

Wang Man scammed out of thousands of yuan, recently discovered and apprehended

Chen Zhaoxi (also known as Chen Caishou), a native of Anhui, is currently 42 years old. He was previously married to Jin Suhua, a woman from Taizhou. Later, in 1936, through the introduction of Lin Bixia, a student at Guangxia High School, Chen met Wang Man (an Anhui native, currently 28 years old), a high-achieving student at the school. At the time, Chen told Wang that his first wife had already passed away and expressed his desire to marry Wang as his second wife.

Wang believed this to be true and agreed. Consequently, they held a wedding ceremony in Hangzhou on May 14th of that year. After the wedding, they came to Shanghai and lived together at No. 44, Lane 847, Tian Road. With Wang's financial assistance, Chen established the Minyi Silk Flower Company at their residence. Later, Chen borrowed a total of 5,500 yuan in legal tender from Wang in installments. Among them, 2,000 yuan was borrowed from Wang's aunt, Cao Langshi, through Lin and other shareholders of Minyi. By February of this year, none of the borrowed money

had been repaid. Cao Langshi stepped forward to assert her creditor's rights, and a settlement was reached. Subsequently, Chen told Wang that he was experiencing significant losses in his shipping business and that he had to temporarily disappear due to pressure from creditors. Wang then temporarily stayed at her mother's home at No. 15, Lane 108, Mu Ming Road. Chen also disappeared from then on. However, recently, Wang Man received a confidential tip that Chen's claim of evading debt was

untrue. In reality, he was cohabitating with another woman. The location of their cohabitation was No. 44, Lane 847, Tian Road. Wang then reported this to the Shanghai Police Department. On the 6th of the month, Chinese Detective Xu Huanqing went to arrest Chen and found him in bed with another woman. He took them back to the police station. It was discovered that the woman's name was Jin Suhua, who was Chen's previous wife. It was only then that Wang learned that Chen's previous claim of his wife's death was a lie. Upon further investigation, it was revealed that Chen was aware that Wang had some financial resources and that his marriage to her was

clearly a form of fraud. The police department filed charges of adultery against Chen in this case. The First Special Court issued a summons, but Chen and others failed to appear. Consequently, an arrest warrant was issued, but Chen could not be found. A wanted warrant was then issued, and Chen was finally apprehended the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Wang hired lawyer Wu Linkun to appear in court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian and Qi Qi presented the facts of the case. Under the questioning of Judge Zhan Liangce, Chen was ordered to be detained for further questioning at a later date.

### Dalongxing Coal Company Urges Customers to Clear Stock

Our local Dalongxing Coal Company has recently observed that customers are secretly hoarding goods after placing orders without withdrawing them, which has greatly affected the local citizens and caused them to suffer undue losses. Therefore, we have specially revised our business methods starting today. Hereafter, customers who purchase goods must be verified to be from the same industry or have actual needs before they are supplied as usual, and they must clear their stock within a limited time; otherwise, we will not sell to them. Those who have previously placed orders for stock are hereby notified to withdraw their goods.

### Zhong Deli Robbery Case, Gang Robbers Sentenced Separately, Ten Handguns and Forty-Five Bullets Confiscated

The Yongda Flower Shop at No. 14, Zhong Deli, at the intersection of Beijing Road and Shanxi Road, was previously broken into and robbed. When the robber gang had not yet left, the Central Police Department received a report, and Western Inspector Qiong Si, Chinese Detectives Feng Qishan, Gao Zhen, Yan, Peng Bingsheng, and other Chinese and Western detectives from the shift rushed to arrest them. They exchanged gunfire and fought each other, and the robbers Wu Shaoyou and Gao Zhigui were killed on the spot. Western Inspector Ma Ya was also slightly injured. As a result, after the detectives searched and arrested them in all directions, they captured a total of 21 accomplices, including Song Ziqing, and seized ten handguns and forty-five bullets. It was found that they had committed no less than dozens of cases. They were sent to the First Special Court, and police lawyer Ru Bao prosecuted them according to law. The interrogation has already concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiexun opened the First Criminal Court and announced the verdict.

### Christian Federation Charitable Sacred Music Concert

The Christian Penni Fourth Mass, a world masterpiece, is scheduled to be performed for the first time in Shanghai at Moore Memorial Church on the evenings of April 27th and 28th. 150 people will participate, all of whom are members of various church choirs. Professor Zhao Meibo, a music expert, will conduct. Those who donate can listen to two hours of sacred music. Moore Memorial Church has already built a stage. Now that the weather is clear and pleasant, it is appropriate to hold this event in a suitable location for charitable work. Last time, Professor Zhao led his students to perform at the Guangming American Naval Chapel, and 5,000 people were unable to enter that day, which shows the grand occasion. It is said that there are limited seats in Moore Memorial Church, and it is feared that there will not be enough tickets on that day. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will remit money to exchange for tickets as soon as possible to avoid the possibility of missing out at the last minute.

### Regulations on Certification Methods for Retail Yarn and Cloth Products

To be implemented from May 1st

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent letters to relevant trade associations yesterday regarding the certification of retail yarn and cloth products, stating, "We hereby inform you that the cotton yarn and cotton cloth used by local businesses to manufacture Western suits, shirts, ties, towels, parasols, shoe materials, and hat materials are mostly purchased piecemeal from yarn shops, cloth shops, or weaving factories. When their finished products are transported for sale and they apply to our chamber for certificates of domestic goods, it is inevitable that there is no basis for verification because the procedures for domestic yarn registration and wholesale registration cannot be applied. Our chamber convened a meeting of relevant industries on April 20 to discuss and agree on a method: for cotton yarn purchased piecemeal, no more than 39 small packages (less than one piece), and cotton cloth no more than ten bolts, for use as raw materials in this port, the purchaser shall present the invoice issued by the yarn shop, cloth shop, or weaving factory, and forward it to its respective trade association or federation for official stamp certification (such as Western suits, shirts, and ties, forward the request to the Western Clothing Industry Association). The Yarn Industry Association, the Machine Weaving Industry Association, and the Cotton Cloth Industry Association shall issue a certificate of sale of retail yarn and cloth based on the aforementioned invoices. When Western suits, shirts, ties, parasols, shoes, and hats are transported for sale to other locations and an application is made to our chamber for a certificate of domestic goods, the certificate of sale of retail yarn and cloth shall be submitted to our chamber for review along with the application for use as raw material proof. After each production run uses up the certificate of sale of retail yarn and cloth, it should be clearly noted for each batch sale. The associations that issue the certificates of sale of retail yarn and cloth should also compile statistics at the end of each month on the number of retail yarn and cloth sold in this port by a certain shop or factory and submit them to our chamber for wholesale registration. The retained sales vouchers from the yarn factories should also be retrieved from the factories and sent to our chamber for cancellation at the time of the summary wholesale registration. This method will be implemented on May 1st. All retail yarn and cloth purchased from May 1st onwards must be handled in accordance with this method; otherwise, our chamber will not issue certificates. For retail yarn and cloth purchased by the Western clothing industry, the towel industry, the parasol industry, the industry, and the Zhuang industry before the end of April, although the quantity is certainly not large, a clear distinction must be made before the implementation of issuing certificates of sale of retail yarn and cloth to avoid confusion. The respective associations should notify their members to list the names and quantities of the goods purchased from which shops before April 30th, and attach invoices and other documents to register with our chamber. If this procedure is not followed, our chamber will not issue certificates at that time. It is hoped that you will investigate and handle this matter accordingly. As for cotton yarn purchased in quantities of one piece or more each time, and cotton cloth in quantities of ten bolts or more each time, the wholesale registration procedure should still be prepared each time, and the monthly summary wholesale registration method does not apply. This is hereby declared."

### Municipal Council Concert

The Municipal Council Music Team is scheduled to hold its 28th weekly symphony concert at the Lyceum Theatre at 5:15 PM on the 26th of this month. The program includes three items.

### Nanjing Commercial Bank, New Manager Appointed to Shanghai Branch

Zhao Puzhi Took Office Yesterday

Since the Nanjing Commercial Savings Bank moved its head office out of Nanjing, General Manager Zhang Jinghuo has been preparing to establish branches in Hong Kong and Shanghai. The Shanghai branch of the bank officially opened at No. 80 Jiujiang Road, Sichuan Road last June, following the Hong Kong branch. It has provided a great deal of assistance to various industrial and commercial sectors and has gained a good reputation. Now, in order to develop its business, General Manager Zhang has hired Zhao Puzhi to serve as manager and assist the current Deputy Manager Zhu Kaiguan in managing the bank's affairs. Mr. Zhao officially took office yesterday. More than 200 leaders from all walks of life and friends of Mr. Zhao, including Lin Kanghou, Yang Kuihou, Shen Kuanfu, Lu Chongzhi, Lu Guicong, and Zhu Haichu, were present, resulting in a temporary surge in deposits.

### Taicang Yang Mengzhou Funeral Announcement

It is now learned that he has chosen May 1st of the Gregorian calendar to hold the funeral for his deceased father. It is expected that there will be a continuous stream of mourners in plain cars and white horses, and that the funeral will be extremely mournful and honorable.

### Weather Report

In the coastal area south of Ma Island, the weather will change from cloudy to overcast, with fog or rain, and northeast winds.

### Re-transcription of Old Newspapers Sixty-seven Years Ago (364)

(See this newspaper from the twelfth year of the reign of Tongzhi in the late Qing Dynasty)

A Praiseworthy Tale of Returning Money

Mu Ada made a living by selling. He went out very early every day because he had to go to the outskirts of the southern city to sell goods, carrying them into the city to sell. Early in the morning of the first day of the month, he had just left home when he saw a small blue cloth package on the ground. He picked it up and it felt very heavy, so he turned around and went back into the house. He opened it and found two hundred copper coins and ten foreign coins. Mu and his wife were both very happy to see them, thinking that they would have good luck if they obtained this unexpected wealth, so they congratulated each other! Mu suddenly thought, "I live a hard life, earning very little. It is natural for me to be overjoyed to get this all of a sudden, but I don't know who the loser is. If he is like me, or even worse off than me, won't he be worried about his life?" So he wanted to imitate the act of returning the money. His wife thought, "Since it didn't come from robbery, it was a gift from heaven, so it's okay to accept it. Why bother with such a foolish act?" Mu said, "If heaven is kind to me, what can't I get rich from? Why would it necessarily be from this little bit?" So he decided to return it to the loser. He also thought, "If I go out to trade, I'm afraid my wife will be greedy for small profits and not return it if the finder comes." Therefore, he did not do business and waited at the door. The next morning, an old man staggered over, with tears in his eyes, looking around. He knew he was looking for something. Mu deliberately asked, "Old man, where are you going? Please come in and sit down for a while." The old man replied that he did not know him and did not want to enter. Mu insisted on bringing him in. The old man told him that he would go look for something first and come back later. Mu asked what he had lost. The old man told him and said, "My home is in Yinjiang Bridge. My daughter-in-law died in bed. This money was borrowed from relatives of my deceased daughter. The two hundred coins are for travel expenses." Mu asked what identifying marks there were. The old man said that there was a black double coin thread on the corner of the blue handkerchief. Mu examined it and it was indeed the case, so he returned the original item to him. The old man burst into tears and kowtowed countless times. He also said, "Seeing that you are also in a difficult situation, I am willing to share a small portion to repay you." Mu swore that he would not accept it, so the old man bowed again and left. This is a rare occurrence among greedy vendors.

Spring and Autumn

### The Reappearance of Rent Disputes

— A Precedent

Despite earnest pleas from all walks of life, the public concession's tax increase was ultimately passed at the taxpayers' meeting. I remember reading an article in this journal last month, a small report after the Municipal Council announced the tax increase, which said: "With more than three months to go before July 1, the sublessors have already raised the rent in anticipation." As a result, the author came to the conclusion that if the tax increase passed, rent disputes would inevitably increase (or words to that effect). Now that the tax increase has been passed, sure enough, the first rent dispute has been seen in the newspaper of the 22nd: "All the tenants of Fongsheng Lane on Moore Road oppose the Yipin Loan Bank's advertisement threatening to cut off water to coerce rent increases." Although the advertisement did not necessarily mention the tax increase, judging from the phrase "This bank has only been leasing for a few months, but it is increasing the rent," it is somewhat related to the tax increase. At the same time, this dispute is seen in the newspapers; countless other disputes may be happening in everyone's homes.

Since land rent, water, and [blank space] have increased, the large and small sublessors have used this as an excuse to take several times the amount from the third-tier tenants. If all the words in the past newspapers were gathered together, they might not be inferior to a great work. Now that there is a 50% tax increase, the landlords and sublessors will naturally have something to do.

According to the survey in the previous month, the city's population has decreased from five million to five hundred thousand, and there are indeed more "for rent" signs everywhere, indicating that many people have already been squeezed dry and have escaped! (Are they returning to their occupied hometowns?) If they are squeezed further, another drop from four million is inevitable. Regardless of whether they return to the occupied areas, or hang themselves and starve to death, the fact that the houses will be empty is always a reality. At that time, the sublessors' "excuse" cannot be used to complain to the landlords, and the landlords will naturally have to pay empty taxes. Therefore, the increase must be frank and the distribution must be fair. Only by helping each other in the same boat can we reach the shore of victory. I hope you do not ignore this cliché.

### Shop Owner, Staff, Customer

— Yu Bi

Three Parties' Interests at Stake

After reading Quan Jun's short article in this journal on the 15th, I had deep feelings. At first, I thought they were "putting on airs" and was often resentful in my heart; but since I joined a certain company, I realized why those shop assistants' faces often looked like "iron-faced Taoists." It turns out that they all came from apprenticeships and, after ten or eight years, their salaries are still only about twenty or thirty yuan, without food or lodging. The words "plain noodles" are often on their lips; some sleep in the shop, setting up their beds early in the morning and putting them away late at night, while others live with relatives and friends, saving every penny to barely get by. Their state of mind is naturally not good. A bad state of mind also affects the politeness they should have towards customers.

Wise bosses, if you want to improve your business, you certainly cannot ignore the politeness of the shop assistants towards the customers; but if you improve the treatment so that they can work with peace of mind, they will also automatically pay attention to politeness towards customers. How can you make them work with peace of mind? The methods are described roughly as follows:

(1) Provide accommodation for shop assistants, and there must be a fixed place.

(2) Provide full board, not just lunch, or no board at all.

(3) The monthly salary should be discussed after deducting food and lodging.

(4) Calculate the cost of living every three to four months and add a discretionary allowance.

(5) If the shop has a surplus at the end of the year, a bonus should be given according to the amount earned, if the amount is ten months. Old employees with service achievements and excellent performance should be given a bonus.

(7) Shop assistants should have the opportunity to recuperate and enjoy normal entertainment. If they attend school or participate in pure professional organizations, the shop should subsidize all or part of the tuition or membership fees.

(8) If shop assistants have family burdens, there should be special remedies.

The above is just a rough description of what I have seen and heard. Wise bosses, if you can do all or most of these things, the shop assistants will not feel pain in their minds and bodies, and they will feel that the success or failure of the shop is closely related to them, so they will naturally be dedicated to their work and polite to customers.

Wise bosses, please look further ahead.

### Egg Yolks are Easy to Digest

Letter from Dr. Wang Yugang

(The above is omitted) The common perception of eating eggs is that egg whites are easy to digest and nutritious, while egg yolks are suffocating and not nutritious. Therefore, even patients who can eat eggs often eat egg whites and discard egg yolks. This is actually the opposite of what is known in theory and in practice. According to chemical analysis, egg yolks, in addition to pure protein, contain sulfur, fat, and mineral complex compounds (market-popular flecks are extracted from them). Compared to pure protein, they have greater nutritional value and are easier to digest. Therefore, from the perspective of scientific principles, for patients who can be nourished by eggs, the egg white should be discarded and only the egg yolk should be given to them. If this is the case for patients, then the nutritional value of egg yolk for healthy people is even more beneficial.

### Beware of Being Cheated Out of Delivery Fees

— Fan

The business of making money by war is almost everywhere. Even the delivery fees for litigation documents in the court are being counterfeited to cheat people out of money. Therefore, I am writing about the situation of my family being cheated, so that people who have not been cheated can take precautions.

At about 1:00 PM on Saturday, a so-called "bailiff" came with a briefcase and asked as soon as he entered the door, "Is this so-and-so? Is so-and-so here?" He then took out a stack of court summons and other documents from his bag, took out one, and asked, "The court has ordered the delivery, and the delivery fee is six cents, two cents for the transportation fee, and four cents to be handed over to the court." The family members saw that he was from the court, and his words were sincere and his clothes were neat, so they naturally did not suspect that he was fake and paid him. He took it and said, "Wait in court early on a certain day, don't be late. Goodbye!" And left.

When I came home in the evening, I took one look at this summons-like paper and knew something was wrong. Because the paper was just a few sentences written casually, without the court's seal, and without the name seal of the judge or clerk, only the four words "Bailiff's Seal" were written at the bottom, and it was not named. The most striking thing was that the words "Bailiff's Delivery Fee" and "Shanghai First Special Zone Local Court" were cut out from other documents. When I checked the date on the calendar, it was a Sunday, and my case had already ended in mid-July last year. I thought to myself, "There is no need for the court to investigate again; even if there is another inquiry, it wouldn't be without a seal, would it? Isn't this a forgery?" But the case number and name written on it are indeed the same as mine, so I suspect that this was done by someone familiar with the inside situation.

I am writing about what happened to give a warning to the general public who have not been deceived, so that they will not pay a nameless loss in vain again, and so that he will not dare to try again.

Chapter 23: Old Friends and New Companions, Literature Has Value, Famous Scenic Spots Can Be Controlled

Because the current use is more for use, and the art of photography has also progressed further. Recently, it is not popular to use large cameras, but only small ones. Small cameras are favored for their lightness and portability, and when folded, they can be safely tucked into a pocket. Because the lenses are good and the manufacturing is precise, even if they are extremely small, enlargements are flawless. Some even say that cameras are installed in coat linings or on the waistbands of suits, so that by simply opening the outer clothes and flicking a finger, a person can be photographed. That is only for detectives who need to catch people off guard to take pictures. Otherwise, taking a photo should be done with the person's consent, as it is a social courtesy. However, people rarely disagree with being photographed, as photography is now as common as tea and rice in modern life. Especially in newspapers, illustrations and text are equally important. If you open a newspaper and there are no illustrations at all, it is dull and uninteresting. Therefore, all field reporters have very sophisticated cameras. Some are equipped by the newspaper, and some belong to the field reporters themselves, like Shao Huihua, who has several cameras. There is also a special thing in the newspaper, which is the so-called electronic transmission of photos. They have a portable electronic transmitter. Whenever a reporter goes out and takes such a portable transmitter, as long as she is within a thousand kilometers and there is a telegraph office, she can turn on the portable transmitter, connect it to the telegraph line, and send it to the newspaper. Imagine how convenient this is. When the newspaper receives the photos they sent, it can immediately make a plate and print it in the newspaper. Now let’s talk about the female technician. After taking a photo with them, Shao Huihua said, "Sister Danyu should have a special photo taken because you are a newlywed." Jin Danyu was a little unconvinced and said, "Why should I have a special photo taken? You still have that kind of feudal thinking." Qu Wushuang came out to mediate and said, "Not only Sister Danyu, but all the sisters should have a special photo taken. Sister Airen is a star in our female medical community. She is dedicated to the cause of midwifery and infant care. We admire her very much and should take two extra photos. The two He sisters are the most progressive textile industrialists. You should especially take two more photos. I suggest that you first take a group photo and then take two separate photos. Because you are so similar that if you two are not wearing different colored clothes, it is really confusing. Let's see if there are such similar sisters in a group photo. In two separate photos, because no matter how similar, there is always a slight difference. We will carefully distinguish the differences and where they are." (267)

### Being a Son of God (3)

Contact with the personality and spirit of Jesus can also give us such encouragement and power, but the difference is that Jesus shows us the value of destiny, not in how it was in the past, nor in how it is now, but in the infinite achievements of the future. Therefore, it is not enough to have our minds filled with noble thoughts, dreams, and plans for a while. Aspiring to spiritual progress for a while is one thing. Continuing to strive for progress every day is another. The essence of Christianity is to enable people to have the enthusiasm and ability to be sons of God, and to do their best, as opportunities allow, to be instruments of God and transform this world. Therefore, we must ask ourselves, what is in our minds now? What are we striving for every day? What is the value and goal of life? Jesus is the Son of God, but he is also a model. We can also have the spirit of Jesus. This is what we believe. For this reason, we must open our hearts and receive His spirit. Everyone can be a son of God. If we all lived like sons of God, what would the world be like? We must measure people by their future achievements. People work not for personal gain, but for the future development of their work. The value of a person's life is not in his past background, nor in his current wealth, but in the future development obtained from his own creation and willpower. This is the basic goal of being human. The word "limited" should not exist in people. There should only be a strong will and continuous effort. Only when society is saturated with such motivation can there be a new and admirable culture. For two thousand years, people of all kinds have come to Jesus and received the power to become children of God. Like them, we should move forward and never give up. We should have courage and go forward to obtain peace and personal power. As long as we are willing to do this great crusade, our character can be fully developed and infinitely advanced. End

### New Trends in Hollywood

— Hua Zhi

Hollywood film critics are revealing the slogan "Year of Mystery" for this year. According to the speculation of beauty authority Frank Victor, the "Ooh Girl" style that was popular last year will become outdated this year and no one will care about it. Fans will no longer admire "sexiness" but will welcome a natural and fresh atmosphere, with a mysterious style. This will be fully performed in the film "Miss America of 194-".

Many stars who have been in retirement for a while will make a comeback this year. The most popular is the comedian Charlie Chaplin. He will have two or more new films released this year. With his broad satire and smile, he will be repeatedly recognized as the leading artist of the silver screen. Second, Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich may be very active.

In this mysterious year, the four young men who are admired for their romance will undoubtedly have fierce competition. Clark Gable will inevitably compete with Taylor Power to maintain the "highest grossing record." Robert Taylor made three films in a row last year with surprisingly poor box office results. This year, he had to create a new style. Charles Boyer, after returning to France to join the army for a while, has recently returned to Hollywood. Women will definitely expect a new stimulus from his heroism.

Among the actresses, Bette Davis, who won the throne last year, will continue to maintain her unwavering record. As for those child stars, such as Shirley Temple, Deanna Durbin, Gloria Jean, and Mickey Rooney, although they may not be able to create a special style, their liveliness and beauty will be as exciting as Chaplin and Garbo.

### Random Notes on Pianists' Skills

— Ke Yunlou Master

Xu Lanyuan - The tone is clear and melodious, and the reasoning is correct. His and Wang Shaoqing's creation of the Mei school of piano accompaniment was a sensation. The tunes he played seem ordinary on the surface, but they are quite strict in handling and never slacken. It is difficult to start without long-term cultivation. In the film "Life and Death Hate," following Wan Hua's graceful singing, rising and falling together, he has a unique style when closing the voice and looking around, with ingenious originality, pleasing to the ear, and a sense of leisurely yearning. However, he often likes to deliberately lengthen the tone between "Gong-Chi" to show off his ability, which is a flaw.

Mu Tiefen - His wrist strength is outstanding, and his finger tone is strong. He can compete with Zhu Zuo Chen Yanheng. His piano style has not changed slightly in the past ten years. Occasionally, in order to suit the current fashion, he slightly showed his "transformation" in the "Wild Mountain Tears" recording by Zuo Yushuang, but the rhythm is still complete. The "small interlude" is drawn out拍拍. Recently, he still maintains a consistent style and never dabbles in flowery tricks to follow the fashion. People admire him very much. This time, I listened to dozens of performances and felt that his tone was too low and could not test his sharpness. According to his piano tone, it is most suitable for the "B" character, but now it cannot be fulfilled because of the restriction of E Yun; and he follows the tune everywhere, unable to do what he wants. He only shows his skills slightly when playing the "large interlude," which is extremely limited. Occasionally, in this play, I listen to the clear performance of "Crying Emperor Heaven" and other songs, but only for a moment. The high-pitched tone and the rhythm of tearing silk are completely missing, which is disappointing.

Yang Baozhong - Baozhong is also a self-taught musician, the same as Hongshou. He has a unique and outstanding finger tone among the piano accompanists for old male roles, and can be regarded as a leading figure. When he assisted Wen Ru, his playing tended to be "transformed," as if he had lost the original purpose of practicing the piano. He is an elder who has experienced many masters. Wen Ru's melody is clever and often has no fixed place, while Baozhong moves from chaos to tranquility. In the "transformation" of the piano, he does not lose his correctness and highly regards the format of the piano (the piano of Yan San, who learns his chaos, cannot get it right. Although the appearance is the same, it is extremely difficult to listen to). Therefore, studying his piano style is not suitable for Wen He, and now it has been heard that they have split up. But it is also difficult for him to cooperate with his younger brother Baosen, because the singing and playing are different, how can he achieve this excellent state?

Chen Hongshou - Hongshou originally studied old male roles, but after his voice deteriorated, he assisted Wang Shaolou on the piano. Shaolou's singing tone was low and hoarse, but Hongshou was able to show off his skills in a cramped tone; and the rhythm was clear, meticulous, and the tone was quiet and melodious, showing the mystery of his support of the singing. It can be heard that Shaolou's record tone is close to the word "climb," but it is widely welcomed and sells well both in the north and south. This is not because his singing is directly appealing, but because it is easy for people to learn. And Hongshou's skill also accounts for half of it.

### Advice to Fans from Movie Stars

—

Maureen O'Sullivan: "Don't think that appearing on the screen is an easy task; an actor without education will be laughed at everywhere; and it is even more important to have careful preparation before appearing on the screen."

Paulette Goddard: "Your attitude towards us actors should be one of kind care; unwarranted harassment is unacceptable; otherwise, our work will be greatly affected. Because I don't like to interact with the outside world, you have given me the nickname of 'Mysterious Girl.' This phenomenon completely disrespects my personality."

Dorothy Lamour: "In your eyes, you must think that the lives of stars are always extremely luxurious and comfortable; this concept is completely wrong. Before I entered the film industry, I worked as an elevator operator in a company in New York. The life at that time was truly unbearable for ordinary people. So now, although the income is enough for me to enjoy a comfortable life, I can't help but feel shabby when I think of the conditions of the past."

Lionel Barrymore: "I am now old and faded, but my career on the screen and on the stage is almost sixty years. From my experience, I know that the most important thing to hope that a young artist can continue to improve is to give him correct criticism in many ways. If the audience only knows how to praise blindly or support carelessly, it is tantamount to letting him step into the path of ruin."

Janet Gaynor: "Fans have a common goal, which is to hope that the productions of stars who already have a high status or superb acting skills can be better. This cannot be achieved because there is one reason: first, their energy is as limited as ordinary people. Second, because they already have a high status or superb acting skills, they cannot perfunctorily deal with each of their productions and ruin their reputation. In this way, the time spent in production is of course incomparable to that of ordinary productions, so there cannot be a large number of productions."

### Zhou Jianyun Recognizes New Talents

— Yi Xing

Zhou Jianyun's establishment of a new company has now become concrete. However, directors and actors are a rather serious problem. Not long ago, someone recommended Jin Suqin to Zhou to star in "Wen Ji Returns to Han." Whether it will be completed is currently unknown. However, Zhou discovered a young girl named Qiao Qiao in the Zhong Theater Company's performance of "Peach Blossom Spring." She is only fifteen years old and grew up in Beiping. Her Mandarin is naturally fluent and unparalleled, and her acting is even more talented. When she sings, her voice is sweet and pleasant. According to reporters, Qiao Qiao's real name is Wang Qiaoyu. She is currently studying at Qingxin Girls' High School. Because she loves drama, she occasionally makes a cameo appearance. As for filming, I wonder if her family will allow it?

Chen Yuelou, the chairman of the Shanghai Actors' Joint Association, has recently been persuaded by several representatives repeatedly, taking the overall situation of the Actors' Association as the most important thing. He politely agreed to reluctantly take on the role. However, before resuming his position, there is one condition: we must work together to recover the houses and properties in Liyuanfang.

### A Demonstration Work of the British Film Industry

— Jing Yuan

Recently, the British government completed the production of two demonstration works:

One is: "Crisis in the Pacific," which puts Japan's policies in the Far East, the defense of Hong Kong Singapore, and the naval power of the US Pacific outpost Guam on the screen one by one. And General Yarnall, former commander of the US Asian Fleet, narrated the recent real situation of the Chinese war, and there is also considerable description of the heroic combat of the Chinese soldiers. The material of the whole film is completely cut and pieced together from news films and completed with the most meticulous and complex production procedures.

There is also: "Cavalcade of the Navy"; which describes the history and development of the navy in detail. The whole film begins with the naval situation in ancient Phoenicia and Rome and continues to the current British navy. Finally, the vast lineup of the British Navy is displayed on the screen. The purpose of its production is, on the one hand, to give its own people a deeper understanding, and on the other hand, of course, to make a demonstration to the enemy!
