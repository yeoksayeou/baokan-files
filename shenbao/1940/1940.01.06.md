### Military Situation of the Anti-Japanese War in Jiangxi in the Past Year

Ji'an: In the past year, in the military situation of the anti-Japanese war in Jiangxi, the people and the military cooperated to fight fiercely, and the Japanese suffered heavy losses, showing signs of exhaustion. In late March, the Japanese deployed the ×× two divisions to meet in Hefei and Nanchang. This was the prelude to the first battle in the 28th year. After a bloody battle for ten days, the Japanese (China Dispatch Army) suffered more than 30,000 casualties, including four dead regimental commanders and many battalion commanders. The only price they paid was an empty city. Afterwards, a part of the Japanese army invaded Gao'an to the west, and a part attacked Wuning fiercely, attempting to threaten Changsha. As a result, they were severely attacked by the Chinese army in the Mufu Mountain area. Two Japanese regimental commanders have been killed. It is commendable that Gao'an has been won and lost twice, and more than 3,000 Japanese troops have been annihilated in the battle for the city. In April, the Chinese army fiercely attacked Nanchang, entering the old and new airfields and reaching Zhongshan Road. More than a thousand soldiers destroyed Japanese military equipment, inflicting a major blow on the Japanese army in terms of morale, causing them to lie dormant in a corner, not daring to take a step beyond the boundaries. By the end of September, the Japanese army launched a large-scale attack on Hunan, and the Japanese army invading from western Jiangxi was intercepted into several sections in Shangfu Luofang Huibu and south of Xiushui, killing nearly 10,000 Japanese troops. This battle was one of the most brilliant scenes in Jiangxi's battles over the years. In December, China recovered Xiangfu, Jing'an City, Zhanggongdu, Longchangqiao, and other places, and stormed into the urban area of ​​Nanchang. Now, the Japanese puppets in Nanchang are panicked and heartbroken, forming extreme panic. In the later Lushan Minshan and other places, a wide range of guerrilla warfare was launched to make the Japanese restless. Five hundred battles were fought in the year, capturing Japanese officers and soldiers Otsuka Yosuke, Kashu Gunko, etc., killing more than 50,000 Japanese troops, and seizing more than a thousand guns and cannons. Furthermore, the Nanchun transportation was destroyed, which was very miraculous. The Japanese faced difficulties in land communication and resupply, and could not take care of the beginning and the end. In summary, in the 28th year, in addition to losing the two lines north of Nanchang and south of Xiushui, the remaining areas were all controlled by the Chinese army. Between the points and lines, more than 40,000 to 50,000 Japanese soldiers were absorbed. In the past, the ×××××× Corps withdrew for reorganization, and the new ones from the Yangtze River were also under heavy siege and attack. (Dispatch of the 4th)

### Tianjin Silver Issue: The Japanese Side Coerces Britain to Concede, Saying That Whether to Relax or Terminate the Blockade of the Concessions Will Depend on the Progress of Negotiations

Tokyo: This question has received reports that negotiations between Britain and Japan in London, Tokyo, and Tianjin indicate that Britain is willing to make concessions. Britain seems to want to find out the scope of the rights Japan grants to British ships to navigate the Yangtze River before deciding on the final solution to the Tianjin silver issue. It is understood here that in the Tianjin agreement, the British side put forward two new conditions as the price for handing over the Tianjin silver: (1) A part of the Tianjin silver must be handed over to the British-Japanese mixed committee to help refugees in North China. (2) The remaining silver must be handed over to a neutral bank. Political figures here believe that the arrival of British Chinese Ambassador Karl in Chongqing is related to the future resolution of the silver issue. Tokyo newspapers believe that the above-mentioned solution is a concession from the Japanese side. Japan initially demanded that the British side unconditionally hand over the Tianjin silver. Now, adding conditions is to seek a compromise with the British side. Japanese officials reiterated that relaxing or terminating the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin depends on whether the British side is willing to make further concessions. Even if the guards in the British and French concessions are reduced, and even if British and French warships are withdrawn, the Japanese side does not consider it a friendly gesture towards Japan. Responsible personnel said that Britain's attitude towards China is only a slight retreat due to the European war and has not abandoned the principles it holds in China.

Editorial

### Personnel Disputes in Industry and Commerce

Since the soaring prices, industrial and commercial employees have demanded subsidies to maintain their livelihoods, resulting in work stoppages and strikes. Fortunately, both parties can often deeply understand the meaning of mutual assistance and mutual concession, and all can be resolved peacefully. This newspaper has earnestly stated in the December 14th editorial "General Discussion on Labor Unrest"; It is hoped that employees will not make excessive demands, and capitalists will not take retaliatory actions. There is no need to make loved ones grieve and enemies rejoice, which is to preserve a part of the country's economic vitality. Now, as the end of the accounting period is approaching, according to the long-standing custom, the issue of dismissing employees from factories and firms is always carried out after the end of the accounting period. I would like to ask the leaders of all industries to consider the current difficult living conditions. All that can increase the severity of unemployment problems and indirectly threaten local security should be avoided in this extraordinary period if it can be avoided. Those that cannot be avoided should also weigh the severity of the incident and make a fair and reasonable decision, so that those who stay will know what to do, and those who leave will be punished, so as to demonstrate the spirit of faith, reward, and punishment, and stabilize a long-lasting and unexhausted organization. Unexpectedly, at this juncture of the Western New Year, some dismissal trends have been discovered; although their words are held by each, and their reasons are each unique, in this environment, the image of this dispute is most distressing.

Every dispute must have its own special facts and causes and effects. If we only discuss the merits and demerits of individual issues based on general principles, it will be difficult to be completely correct. However, what we want to discuss is that what we seek is labor-capital coordination, mutual assistance for survival, and mutual encouragement to avoid self-determination, and to give those who intend to sabotage the opportunity to take advantage of it. Sincerely, in terms of last year's prices, the Shanghai cost of living index in December increased by two times compared with the pre-war period, even in the first and second half of the year, if rice, wheat, and flour are more than doubled in value, and the price of oil is tripled; and like a spoonful of hot water, which sold for 1.7 cents before the war, now sells for 5 cents. The purchasing power of one yuan of currency is only 32.89% of the pre-war level. This kind of living situation is really unbearable for ordinary employees. When industry and commerce encounter expensive purchase prices or inflated expenses, they can follow suit and raise the price of their goods as a way to compensate; Then, employees still enjoy their original salaries and wages due to the very large expansion of living expenses. May I ask how can they live, how can they invest, and what can they get in return? Therefore, it is necessary to sympathize with and consider the wishes of employees to maintain their livelihoods. Those who take the posture of the masses also take their matter as a matter of the masses, and it is not regrettable that the momentum is close to extortion and it is immediately reported with even greater momentum. In this regard, employees must also consider various aspects and find ways to express their wishes well; If not, taking extortion as a good strategy, then their strategy is also flawed. Since the rise in prices, various companies and stores have been able to automatically improve employee treatment: some have increased salaries, some have set up a subsidy system as an exception, some have increased subsidies, and even exceeded room and board wages, and some have purchased rice and grain at low prices to transfer to employees for food, the methods are different, the examples are many, and the intentions are commendable. To be fair, last year's industry and commerce in Shanghai, except for a few special industries, were generally abnormally developed and abnormally prosperous; the thick profits can almost be said to be unprecedented. In view of this, treating employees favorably is in line with the principles of reason and emotion. However, because the development and prosperity are abnormal, why not be wary of the abnormality being the last year last year? The origin of the abnormality is due to the rise in prices and black remittances, so all those with inventory and those who prepaid foreign exchange have made three times the profit; and even more use "control" and "transport" to make "national disaster money", regardless of whether it is sweet or bitter, fragrant or stinky, in view of this, there are countless people who are rich. When the European war broke out, it was another opportunity to hoard and monopolize, no matter whether it was foreign goods or local goods, they all had the same style. If capitalists gain something, employees should also share a little of the surplus, which is reasonable. In the meantime, there are also those whose business cannot be carried out, who are struggling to maintain their employees' livelihoods and are willing to sit and eat away at expenses. Seeking in Shanghai's hundreds of industries, it is not uncommon, this is their deep and warm feeling of pitying colleagues. These people take into account the difficult times and the same boat in the storm, and promote their benevolence; however, planting the cause today, the consequences are in the future, people are not wood and stone, who will not strive to repay? It is important to know that the prosperity of the business is in the strictness of the method, rather than the harmony of human feelings. Those who are good at management must be able to understand this.

### The Chinese National Political Council Urges the United States to Sanction Japan, Deeply Believing That the United States Will Not Renew the Treaty with Japan, and That the Stability of the Far East Depends on the Future Policy of the United States

Chongqing: The Chinese National Political Council today asked the United States to prohibit the transportation of military materials to Japan, because Japan's aggression against China today, the military materials it uses all come from the United States. The Political Council all believes that whether the United States will renew the treaty with Japan is Japan's internal affairs, so non-insiders should not arbitrarily comment on it, but "the Chinese people deeply believe that the United States will neither renew the treaty with Japan nor establish temporary measures with Japan to continue the trade between the two countries. Only in terms of the overall situation in the Far East, the Chinese people hope that the United States can take further action." Another senator, 20th Jie Hou, broadcasted to the United States here this morning, "If the United States continues to supply Japan with military materials at this time, it will only prolong the life of the aggressor. Therefore, if you cannot prevent the enemy and allow us to achieve an early victory, then at least you will not be of assistance to Japan." (Associated Press Dispatch of the 5th)

Chongqing: Members of the National Political Council staying in Chongqing took advantage of the New Year's recess to discuss the US-Japan trade issue, which will expire on the 26th of this month. They all believe that whether the United States will renew the treaty is a matter of US internal affairs and should not express opinions, but the future of US-Japan trade is closely related to the stability of the Far East and world peace. Based on the deep friendship between China and the United States, it seems that our people should frankly appeal their views to the American people. Since Japan launched the war of aggression against China, the source of its military fire and military supplies has relied on the United States. In both quality and quantity, it is extremely important. Therefore, Vice Chairman Zhang Boling was specially elected to broadcast to the United States at a selected time, so that the American government and people can thoroughly understand the views of our people.

### The US Government Temporarily Takes a Wait-and-See Attitude Towards Japan, Japan's Policies are Easier to Change, and an Economic Sanctions Plan is Inevitable

Washington: According to US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman's statement to the Associated Press today, he intends that the Foreign Relations Committee will not consider imposing an embargo on exports to Japan before the US-Japan trade treaty officially expires on January 26. The Foreign Relations Committee is expected to meet on Wednesday, but the issues to be considered will be limited to domestic issues. According to Pittman, personally, he supports Congress's resolution to prohibit exports to Japan, but this proposal may not be passed by Congress at present, so he advocates that the resolution passed earlier should still be used as a method, that is, Congress authorizes the President to prohibit exports to Japan at an opportune time. According to detached observations, the proposal of the Board of Trustees is to give Japan all kinds of opportunities to improve relations with the United States before January 26. As for Pittman's meaning, he believes that Japan's violation of US rights and interests in China has not been sufficiently corrected. Although the US response to Japan is extremely slow, Japan must respect the assertion of military rights in China, which has become increasingly powerful. The general impression here is that if Japan cannot make a satisfactory solution to the United States before January 26, the State Department will ask Congress to pass an economic sanctions plan against Japan, because at that time, the sanctions plan against Japan will inevitably be passed in Congress, because all the US concessions to Japan have failed, and there is no other way but to be tough on Japan. As for now, taking a wait-and-see attitude is the most appropriate method. (Associated Press Dispatch of the 5th)

### Frequent Military Victories, London Chinese Bonds are Rising

London: Chinese bonds rose sharply yesterday. The reason for this is nothing more than the hope that there will be real efforts to resolve the Sino-Japanese war soon. It is generally known that once the war ends, China's recovery potential will be very great. This can be seen from the latest customs statistics published by the Chinese Embassy. According to these statistics, China's income in 1939 was only slightly less than the previous year. Many people in the financial community who previously predicted that China's income would be greatly reduced now feel that although many of China's trading ports have been closed, China can still obtain this huge amount of customs duties, so once the trade situation returns to normal, China will definitely have a surprising recovery in commerce.

At the same time, Berlin newspapers have stated that Britain and France may propose the demand to transport troops through the Scandinavian Peninsula or the right to build military bases in Sweden and Norway. People in Berlin believe that the efforts of Britain and France to induce the Scandinavian countries to get involved in the war have now entered a decisive stage. If the Scandinavian countries make concessions on this, then Germany will definitely not sit idly by. (Haitong dispatch from the 5th)

New York. The New York "Times" published a dispatch from London for the second time in the past two days, stating that the staff of the Western countries' headquarters are now working hard to promote the involvement of Sweden and Norway in the war against Germany.

Swiss Capital. The German and Soviet radio stations have been touting each other and jointly attacking the Allied countries of Britain and France for a long time, and recently they have become even more intense. The Soviet radio station constantly says that "Britain and France started the war." The German radio station vigorously stated that "the current situation in Europe should not be attributed to the Soviet Union," and said that "when Britain and France were preparing for war, they tried their best to alienate Germany and the Soviet Union, and tried to make them have bloody conflicts. And now, Britain and France are using the pretext of assisting Finland, which has led to the danger of the war expanding." (Havas dispatch from the 4th)

Rome. The Rome People's Daily correspondent in the capital of Sweden recently sent a dispatch stating that after German newspapers repeatedly issued warnings to Sweden, advising it not to assist Finland, public opinion in Sweden unanimously expressed dissatisfaction, saying that "neutrality" should not be confused with indifference or injustice. Moreover, the Soviet Union claims that it is not at war with Finland, and that its dispatch of troops westward is only to assist the Finnish "legal government" (referring to the People's Government led by Kuusinen) in resisting the country's commander-in-chief, General Mannerheim, and his "clique." So why should Germany be meddling? Judging from this statement by the Swedish people, it can be seen that if its borders are indeed violated, the people of that country will definitely rise up and resist, just as in the past. (Havas dispatch from the 5th)

Swiss Capital. The German semi-official "Berlin Stock Exchange Daily" published an article yesterday, accusing the neutral countries of colluding with Britain and France because they are members of the League of Nations. The Basel Evening News commented that the true intention of Germany is unclear, and people generally fear that this strategy is a prelude to new pressure and new threats. The Bern Daily News said that this is an excuse for Germany to engage in new acts of aggression. In fact, that country has never respected the various principles on which the League of Nations is based. Instead, it destroyed Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, tearing up the alliances to shreds, which shows that the country has no right to talk about the qualifications of other countries to participate in the League of Nations. (Havas dispatch from the 5th)

Copenhagen. The National Daily here today gave a strong response to the recent warnings issued by Germany to the Nordic countries, saying: We can now say publicly that we did not expect Germany to find it necessary to warn the Nordic countries not to allow their territory to be used for military purposes by other countries, because there is no such possibility. There is also one thing that we must absolutely clarify, that is, some people demand that the Nordic people should prevent the two major powers from assisting Finland, which is threatened by the dominant military force of Bolshevism, then this kind of demand is morally, materially, and militarily excessive.

### The Soviet Union Is Unwilling to Conclude a Military Alliance with Germany, But Should Expand the Scope of the Non-Aggression Pact, So That Germany Can Prevent Other Countries from Providing Assistance

London. The "Yorkshire Post," the mouthpiece of Dominion Minister Eden, recently reported that according to British diplomatic sources, Stalin would not agree to form a military alliance with Germany, nor would he change his current policy because of the situation encountered by the Soviet Union in the Finnish incident. Therefore, Germany and the Soviet Union should only expand the scope of the existing non-aggression pact, and Germany should put pressure on the Scandinavian countries to isolate Finland. In other words, if other countries attempt to send formal troops to land in the ports of these countries to assist Finland in the future, Germany should use its navy to prevent them. Moreover, if the number of volunteers from various countries going to Finland is too large, Hitler will also decide to take action. (Havas dispatch from the 5th)

Swiss Capital. According to news from Berlin, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will go to Berlin in the near future to return the visit. German political figures believe that the negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union are not limited to the Nordic incident, and often involve the situation in Southeastern Europe. Regarding the issue of allowing troops to be stationed in Romania, Germany is said to have inquired to Hungary about whether it would cooperate in dealing with Romania. The trip of Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky to Italy is probably related to this matter. (Havas dispatch from the 4th)

### Italian Newspaper Calls European War a Social Struggle

Milan. "The Italian News," the mouthpiece of Prime Minister Mussolini, published an editorial today, stating that the material interests of all countries in the world, regardless of belligerent or neutral countries, are directly or indirectly affected by the war between Germany and the Allied countries. The newspaper continued to say that today's European war can be called a "social struggle," a duel between the "have-nots" and the "haves." These "haves" possess large amounts of land and capital, which they use to exploit and suppress other nations, refusing to consider reasonable modifications to the international order. As for the "have-nots," they are causing a "social struggle" because of the large number of children and workers, and the wealth of wisdom and strength. If this kind of class cannot be broken in Europe, then there will never be a lasting foundation for European peace. (Haitong dispatch from the 5th)

### British Ambassador Lothian Speaks in the United States, Says German Offensive Can Be Repelled, Hopes to Transform the World Economy

Chicago. British Ambassador to the United States Lord Lothian told the Foreign Affairs Association here today: "Judging from various phenomena, Germany is attempting to launch a terrifying offensive on land, sea, and air in the early spring, in order to defeat the Allied countries and achieve a decisive victory. But we believe that this offensive will be repelled." The ambassador mentioned the peace conditions, saying: "Today it is clear that in 1919, none of us understood what must be done in order for our hopes to be realized. The principle of the League of Nations must be that all members are democratic countries, and then it can succeed. The League of Nations was too harsh. Our biggest mistake was the economy. We sincerely hope that when the war ends in the future, all countries can be more far-sighted and discuss how the world can be economically transformed." The ambassador continued: "Britain can no longer and should not hold the reins of the world as it did in the last century. The rise of the rights of new naval countries and the power of the sky have made this impossible. Sea power should now be in the hands of all democratic countries, not just the strong countries." (Reuters dispatch from the 5th)

New York. The New York Times commented today on the speech by British Ambassador Lord Lothian to the Foreign Affairs Association in Chicago, saying that no British ambassador has ever given such a frank speech to an American audience as Lothian. His speech can represent the democratization and humanization of British policy, and is in harmony with the policy announced by President Roosevelt on Wednesday. The newspaper said that Lothian's opinion is the same as President Roosevelt's, believing that unless the United States participates in the peace, there is no hope for a final resolution. (Reuters dispatch from the 5th)

### German Wartime Economy, Göring Holds All Power, Issues Order Again to Centralize National Economy, Will Levy New Taxes and Force Savings

Swiss Capital. The German semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating that the German wartime economy has been completely placed under the control of Göring, the dictator of the Four-Year Economic Plan, and a General Affairs Committee will be formed by the leaders of the national economic circles. General Göring will be represented on the committee by Kehrl, the assistant to the Four-Year Economic Plan Office. (Havas dispatch from the 4th)

Berlin. According to the German official news agency last night, General Göring, in his capacity as Special Commissioner of the Four-Year Plan, issued an order again to centralize the national economy, will levy new war taxes, and implement forced savings. People with a monthly income of more than 400 marks must deposit a certain amount of money in designated banks. The government will use this money for the long-term war. (United Press dispatch from the 5th)

Berlin. The topic of discussion in German newspapers today is the centralization of the German wartime economy in the hands of General Göring. The "Essen National Daily" stated that at a time when the Allied countries are in economic difficulty and chaos during this transitional period, Germany has decided to maintain its starting point and seek to strengthen it. After the centralization of the wartime economy, it can produce great efficiency, which is crucial to military operations. At present, under the head of state Hitler, the cabinet committee for national defense assists, with Göring as the chairman of the committee. The committee members include Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Keitel, Minister of Economy Funk, Minister of the Interior Frick, Secretary-General Lammers, etc. All major political and economic powers are in the hands of this committee, so that the nation's industry and commerce can adapt to military affairs during this wartime period. (Haitong dispatch from the 5th)

London. Regarding the German wartime economy being completely presided over by General Göring, the country's dictator of the Four-Year Economic Plan, political figures here have commented that the German side has openly admitted that this is a method to deal with the economic war between Britain and France, which shows that the British and French blockade policies have been effective. From now on, this blockade policy should be intensified, and after Germany's large reserves of raw materials are gradually depleted, there will eventually be a day when they cannot be sustained. It is expected that the country's military strategists will be forced by necessity to break through the British and French blockade at any cost. If so, then Germany will inevitably lose the initiative militarily. (Havas dispatch from the 5th)

### Archbishop of Paris Broadcasts Speech, Calls on French People to Enthusiastically Purchase War Bonds

Paris. The Archbishop of Paris, Verdier, gave a broadcast speech at 7:45 this afternoon, calling on the people of the whole country to enthusiastically purchase the war bonds issued by the government. He said: "While we are striving to uphold our rights, we must not neglect material strength. At this time when the world tide is turning, the civilization and independence of the three countries are being oppressed. Our government wants to defend freedom for the whole world. It calls on the people of the country to do their duty. The people of the country will naturally enthusiastically contribute to strengthen the country. This is worthy of being a true friend of peace. Because weakness cannot overcome stubborn enemies, only strength can be relied upon. In short, all friends of peace must assist France in strengthening its military preparations, in order to curb evil ambitions." (Havas dispatch from the 4th)

### South Patriotic Association Passes "Law Harming the Republic," Authorizes Government to Purge Terrorists

Dublin - Yesterday, the South Patriotic Association passed an emergency bill authorizing the government to purge terrorists by a vote of 62 to 7. The opposition party also supported the government. During the debate, members of parliament frankly criticized the Irish Army. Professor Tierney stated that he was not surprised by the raid on the Phoenix Park armory. Those familiar with the army knew its poor quality, as the Irish Army's poor discipline and mixed composition would not be tolerated by any ordinary army. He said that a national government must now be established, and unless the two main parties in South Ireland reached a compromise, they would soon find that parliament or the parliamentary system was of no use to the nation. Prime Minister Valera stated that the theft of weapons from the Phoenix Park armory was due to routine dereliction of duty. He also said that if the government sought powers not permitted by law, it would be a serious matter, and the constitution would need to be changed. General Mulcahy stated that cooperation between the governments of South Ireland, North Ireland, and the United Kingdom must ensure that the people of South Ireland do not harm the property and people of North Ireland or the United Kingdom, or endanger the political relations between South Ireland and the United Kingdom. Parliament also considered another proposal to grant the government the power to detain suspects who endanger the country as a permanent measure. The South Ireland government had to propose this bill to repeal Section 2 of the "Law Harming the Nation," which Judge Duffy had recently ruled unconstitutional. Defense Minister Aiken stated that as small countries around the world are collapsing, South Ireland, as a weak nation, must have discipline if it wants to survive, and the government must have the support of all good citizens to eradicate revolutionary activities.

He served as an adjutant to the People's Commissar of Defense, Voroshilov, and other positions. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)

Danzig - According to the "Political Newspaper," a large unit of Siberian troops is currently being deployed to the Soviet-Finnish front. This news is said to have come from absolutely reliable sources. Siberian troops are known to be accustomed to the freezing cold and snowy conditions, and their cold resistance is often far better than the troops currently on the Finnish front. The newspaper pointed out that it is not yet known whether the deployment of this unit indicates that the Soviet Union is preparing for a new offensive, but it at least proves that Soviet-Japanese relations have clearly improved, so the Siberian troops can be deployed. (Haitong, 5th)

### Roosevelt's Speech: Berlin's Antipathy; Deemed as Weakening U.S. Neutrality

Amsterdam - The "Electrical News" in Berlin claims that German political circles believe that President Roosevelt's speech at the opening of the U.S. Congress criticized Germany from beginning to end, and that the U.S. President has weakened the U.S.'s neutral stance. The suggestion by U.S. Navy Secretary Edison to place certain industries under direct national management can be said to be evidence of the above view. The U.S. government previously obtained the same power when the U.S. was about to enter the war in 1917. Although it is generally understood that it would be inappropriate to say that this U.S. step is a sign of preparing to participate in the European war, the Germans' confidence in the U.S.'s continued adherence to neutrality in all situations has now diminished. (Reuters, 5th)

Berlin - Political figures here did not feel surprised by President Roosevelt's speech to Congress on the 3rd. They claimed that this speech did not provide any new explanations for the trend of U.S. policy and the attitude of the U.S. President. They offered two points for comment on this speech: (1) Roosevelt mentioned that the method of conquest is incompatible with modern civilization and mentioned the threat of strong countries to small countries. (2) The U.S.'s attitude towards the European war.

The "German Foreign Political Correspondence," the mouthpiece of the German Foreign Ministry, stated that the 19th and 20th centuries are not lacking in precedents of large countries forcibly annexing small countries. At present, the British and French are still attempting to expand the war and involve neutral countries. Regarding U.S. policy, the newspaper believes that it will depend on the implementation of the neutral policy. (Haitong, 5th)

### Roosevelt's Budget Faces Difficulties in Congress; Majority Does Not Approve of New Taxes; Special Committee to Be Formed to Study Solutions

Washington - Congress is extremely cold to the new national defense taxes proposed by President Roosevelt in the budget. According to Senator Harrison, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, "It is not easy to raise 460,000,000 yuan. I dare not approve of this tax increase plan." Therefore, he advocated that a special joint committee be organized by the budget committee to study whether it is appropriate. The members of the House Budget Committee also mostly disapproved of the tax increase plan. However, if the Treasury Department can suggest a way to raise funds, Congress is willing to consider it. Otherwise, Congress believes that the 460,000,000 U.S. dollars should be deducted from other expenditure items and no new taxes should be added. (United Press, 5th)

Washington - President Roosevelt today submitted to Congress the budget for the year ending June 30, 1941, which includes a large increase in U.S. national defense expenditures, estimated at 8,424,000,000 yuan. Revenue is 6,248,000,000 yuan, with a shortfall of 2,176,000,000. The amount of the previous budget shortfall was 3,933,000,000 yuan. The President advocated raising new taxes of 460,000,000 yuan to reduce the shortfall to 1,716,000,000 yuan. It is estimated that various relief efforts other than national defense will use 1,300,000,000 yuan, agriculture 900,000,000 yuan, public works and investment 1,100,000,000 yuan, pensions 1,200,000,000 yuan, public debt interest 1,100,000,000 yuan, and various administrative departments 1,000,000,000 yuan. Regarding the national defense estimate, the next session will increase by 300,000,000 yuan compared to this session. President Roosevelt said that in view of the current world situation, this expenditure is necessary to maintain ordinary national defense preparations and urgent expenditures. Although the budget has increased national defense expenditures significantly, other expenditures are being economized as much as possible. The additional taxes are based on the needs of next year's national defense expenditures. The federal government's credit is at its highest today.

President Roosevelt reviewed his financial policy, saying that the use of government funds to encourage private enterprises has had a great impact on both government and private income. National income has increased by 69% in the past year, the highest increase in the same period in history. The expenditure for relief efforts should be limited to actual needs, but if current hopes are not realized, it may be appropriate to revise this estimate slightly. Some criticize public debt, but it must be known that the government has established or purchased durable and significant assets, but these assets have not yet been included in the register. Regarding

National defense expenditures, including the cost of building army barracks, such as the 1,264,000 yuan needed to build barracks in Hawaii, is one of them. Although the President did not inform Congress of how to collect new national defense taxes, he said that the principle of taxation according to ability should be followed, and taxes that could reduce consumers' purchasing power should be avoided as much as possible. The public believes that the President's words imply that he will not increase commodity taxes, but will increase income taxes. President Roosevelt later submitted the Navy's regular budget to Congress, totaling 904,500,000 yuan, an increase of 183,000,000 yuan compared to last year. The President said that with the additional costs of certain emergency work,

The total amount of the Navy budget will be 1,224,000,000 yuan. Most of the increase will be used for shipbuilding. In addition to the 120 ships scheduled to continue construction, he asked Congress to approve funds to build two battleships, one aircraft carrier, two cruisers, eight destroyers, six submarines, one submarine supply ship, three seaplane supply ships, and one minesweeper. These two battleships are the ninth and tenth ships built in five years, and their tonnage has not yet been announced, but the Navy Department is preparing for 65,000-ton battleships. The Navy budget stipulates 145,000 naval officers and soldiers and 11,500 marines. The Army budget proposes 1,007,000,000 yuan for Army and Air Force expenditures. (Reuters, 4th)

In addition, the President also said that the next fiscal year's budget includes (1) a temporary national defense fee of 302,151,000 U.S. dollars to strengthen the defenses of the "neutral zone of the American continent" and the U.S. coast, and to strengthen counterespionage work, (2) a fee of 291,980 U.S. dollars to promote friendly relations between American countries, and (3) a preparation fee of 40,000 U.S. dollars for the construction of a highway across the American continent.

### Shantou Puppet Army Fails to Invade Fujian; Lin Zhiyuan Defeated at the Border; Captured While Fleeing Towards Raoping

Fuzhou Correspondence, Lin Zhiyuan, a former member of the Fujian Provincial Government, and Xiao Shuyi, a brigade commander of the Provincial Defense Army, were originally related by marriage (Lin's sister is Xiao's sister-in-law). Recently, both have defected to the puppet side. Xiao has been officially dismissed from his military post and his seal of office has been confiscated by the National Government. Lin, as the puppet chief of staff in the Shantou puppet army under Wei Dazhi, guided the Japanese and puppet troops to invade Fujian from the Guangdong border. At the beginning of December, Lin led more than 2,000 puppet troops to invade in two routes. One route was led by bandit Tang ××, who invaded Zhao'an from Huanggang, planning to advance towards Yunxiao. Fortunately, Huanggang was recaptured by the Guangdong army on the 2nd, and they took advantage of the victory to force Shuifengguan (the border between Fujian and Guangdong). The Fujian army also launched a large-scale counteroffensive towards Zhao'an. The puppet army's rear was cut off and they were caught in a pincer attack, causing great panic. They built fortifications in the southeast of Zhao'an County, intending to hold out for reinforcements. After being surrounded and attacked by the Chinese army for three days, the puppet army was killed and wounded more than 700 people. Unable to hold out, bandit Tang led the remaining 400 people to escape into the sea at dawn on the 6th. The Chinese army took advantage of the situation to pursue, and many puppet soldiers drowned. The Chinese army entered the city at noon on the 6th to handle the aftermath. Unexpectedly, at 10 a.m. on the 7th, three Japanese aircraft flew from Shantou and dropped more than 20 bombs in the suburbs of Zhao'an, destroying many houses. The other route was led by Lin Zhiyuan himself, who wanted to invade Hepingfu on the border of Raoping, but was met and defeated by the garrison troops. Except for some killed and wounded, the rest turned to righteousness and requested to be incorporated. Seeing that the situation was not good, Lin hurriedly led the remaining 200 people to flee towards Raoping. On the 8th, while fleeing halfway, they were captured by the army. They are currently detained in a certain place, and the military authorities have been telegraphed for instructions on how to handle them. After Lin defected to the puppet regime, he and Yang Tingshu and Chen Baoshan set up a temporary office of the puppet Fujian Provincial Party Department in Xiamen, planning to guide the puppet army to invade southern Fujian from eastern Guangdong. After arriving in Zhangzhou, they would establish a puppet provincial government and Lin would assume the post of puppet governor. Unexpectedly, the initial dispatch of troops resulted in defeat and capture. From now on, the border between Fujian and Guangdong should be peaceful.

### Chinese Army Attacks Japanese Army in Changxing Town, Haimen

Six Japanese Soldiers Killed; One Tank Destroyed

Haimen Correspondence, Changxing Town in Haimen County has been occupied by the Japanese army for many days. At 6 a.m. on December 26, many plainclothes soldiers from the 2nd Brigade of the Provincial Security Army of the Chinese army, hiding box guns, broke into the Japanese army unit in the town, killing six Japanese soldiers and wounding several others on the spot. The Japanese army was unable to resist and all fled through the back door. The Japanese army stationed in Sanjiao Sijiatu heard the news and rushed to reinforce by tank, but were ambushed by the 3rd Company of the 3rd Regiment of the brigade and were severely attacked head-on, destroying one tank. Seeing that the Japanese reinforcements had arrived and were adding fierce artillery fire, the Chinese army withdrew from the town again. The brigade's soldier, Wu Xuefu, sacrificed himself bravely for the country, and the rest returned to defense safely.

### Prices Soar in Dinghai

The Poor Starving and Freezing

Dinghai Correspondence, Dinghai is an isolated island in eastern Zhejiang. Although its fishery, salt, and seafood are the best in the country, its production of rice, wheat, and other grains is very small. Daily necessities such as cloth, southern goods, northern goods, medicines, cosmetics, enamelware, cotton, coal, soybeans, and wood must be supplied from other places. Since the fall of the city, the price of rice has soared due to Japanese purchases and the control of rice merchants. Recently, the price has reached 30 yuan per stone. Other items such as peanut oil have also risen to more than 1.10 yuan per catty. The worst cigarettes cost about 20 cents a pack. Bai Jinlong, Da Qianmen, Da Paotai, and others cost no less than 7-8 yuan or more than 10 yuan per tin, and are also difficult to buy. Matches cost 4-5 cents per pack. The prices of medicines, silk, coal briquettes, etc. have soared due to inconvenient transportation and obstructed sources. Vegetables and firewood, etc., are extremely inconvenient for villagers to enter the city, and they are often humiliated by the Japanese army, making it very dangerous. Therefore, they all hesitate to enter the city. As a result, there are few vendors in the small vegetable market in the city, and vegetables are cut off. Even if there are any, they cost no less than 10 cents per catty. The firewood that used to cost 1 cent for 2 catties now costs 2-3 cents per catty. Recently, due to the cold weather, a large number of poor people in Dongmen Chenggen and Donggangpu have died on the road due to starvation and freezing, a tragic sight.

### The Bandit Zhang Xiongnan of Fujian Has Been Killed; Bandit Zhang Was Receiving Funds from Japanese Aircraft; Zhang's Concubine, Ye Jinwen, Was Also Captured Alive

Fuzhou Correspondence: Zhang Xiongnan, the third brigade commander of the Fujian Security Forces, after his rebellion, gathered over a thousand of his subordinates and entrenched himself in the mountainous regions bordering Yongchun, Dehua, Datian, and Xianyou counties in central Fujian Province. Additionally, two groups roamed the borders of Yongtai and Yunxi counties, creating disturbances. On one hand, they incited the able-bodied men in various villages to evade conscription and expand their forces. On the other hand, Japanese aircraft transported counterfeit banknotes of the Bank of China and the Fujian Bank to serve as military pay. They also remotely communicated with Huang Dawei's troops, who were conscripted from Chaozhou and Shantou, creating quite a rampant situation. The provincial authorities dispatched Huang Zhenwu, the director of the Security Bureau, as the commander of the bandit suppression in central Fujian, supervising the teams. First, the bandit areas were blockaded, cutting off their transportation and supplies, and then they were suppressed from multiple directions. Over the past two months, the bandit area gradually shrank, and the bandit crowds also collapsed one after another. The enticed able-bodied men even withdrew and returned, causing the bandit forces to become increasingly impoverished. Unexpectedly, in late November and early December, Huang Dawei suddenly sent Lin Zhiyuan with over a thousand pseudo-soldiers from Huanggang on the Guangdong border, sneaking into Zhao'an in Fujian, attempting to seize Longxi. Upon hearing the news, Bandit Zhang also tried to break through from Yongchun, escape to Anxi, and join the pseudo-soldiers in Changtai, with the intention of launching a major offensive. The situation was quite tense for a while. Fortunately, the pseudo-soldiers who invaded Zhao'an were immediately ambushed and annihilated by the border defense forces of Fujian and Guangdong provinces. Lin Zhiyuan was also captured alive in Raoping and sent to the Guilin headquarters for interrogation. Seeing that the general situation was gone and the weather was getting colder, the bandits were still wearing autumn clothes. Due to the transportation blockade, they were unable to purchase cotton clothes, and they were suffering from hunger and cold. Many deserted. Bandit Zhang only led more than two hundred remnants with guns from Shiniushan Mountain in Yongchun to Fengdingge in Dehua. Huang Zhenwu personally led his troops, tracked them down, and encountered the bandits in Guguyu, Fengdingge, on December 16. The bandits fought and retreated, with numerous casualties. Zhang Xiongnan was unable to escape and was killed on the spot. His concubine, Ye Jinwen, was also captured alive. Now, Zhang's body and Ye Jinwen have been sent to Dehua City. The body has been examined and properly buried, while the concubine awaits the disposal of the Pacification Headquarters. The various counties of Yongde, Xian, and Da, which were ravaged by the bandits, can now begin to handle disaster relief, and Fujian Province has thus eliminated a major hidden threat.

### General Situation of China's Promotion of Compulsory Education (II)

(II) Brief History of Development

China's promotion of compulsory education began in the late Qing Dynasty. The regulations were already quite comprehensive, but they were merely empty words and were not actually implemented. After the establishment of the Republic of China, four years of compulsory education were defined, and in 1915, an order to prepare for compulsory education was promulgated, stipulating thirty-one procedures for the implementation of compulsory education. In 1920, methods for promoting compulsory education were re-established, stipulating that it would begin in 1921 and be completed by 1928. A research association for the practical journey of compulsory education was also established for research purposes. However, it ultimately failed to be effectively implemented due to the constant wars of the warlords and the unending civil strife. There was no fixed method for raising funds. After the establishment of the Nationalist Government, the former University Council, in accordance with the resolution of the First National Education Conference in 1928, issued a general order to all provinces and cities to organize compulsory education committees to assist educational administrative organs in promoting compulsory education. In 1929, the Third National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang passed a resolution to vigorously implement compulsory education. In the same year, the Second Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee also resolved to vigorously implement compulsory education, tasking the Training Department with formulating plans, regulations, and implementation procedures in conjunction with the Ministry of Education, with a deadline of the end of 1934 for implementation. The Ministry of Education then formulated a preliminary plan for the implementation of compulsory education based on this plan. The distribution of compulsory education funds shared by the central, provincial, and local governments, the training of teachers, and the expansion of school buildings were all separately stipulated. The Second National Education Conference in 1930 also drafted a plan for the implementation of compulsory education. In addition to setting the term of compulsory education at four years, poor children could vary or shorten their schooling period. Later, the Ministry of Education believed that the number of children nationwide only accounted for 21.8% of the total number of school-age children, and the promotion of compulsory education was inevitably slow. Therefore, in June 1932, it promulgated the Outline of Short-Term Compulsory Education Measures, ordering all provinces and cities to formulate plans for regional experiments. A total of eighteen provinces and cities reported their plans to the Ministry for record. This was the beginning of China's promotion of compulsory education. This short-term compulsory education lasted for three years, but it still failed to fully benefit. Later, based on the resolution of the Fifth Plenary Session, the Outline of Provisional Measures for the Implementation of Compulsory Education was revised and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval on May 28, 1935. After being promulgated and implemented, the Ministry also separately formulated detailed implementation rules, ordering all provinces and cities to raise funds, formulate plans, and actively implement them. The central government also allocated huge amounts of money to subsidize all provinces and cities. China's promotion of compulsory education has thus moved from advocacy to the stage of implementation.

(III) Phased Implementation Plan

The Plan for the Implementation of Compulsory Education formulated in 1935 was probably due to the difficulty of raising funds. Therefore, it stipulated a phased promotion method, first running one-year and two-year short-term primary schools, gradually reaching four-year elementary primary schools. Its implementation procedure was set in three phases:

A. The first phase, from August 1935 to July 1940. All provinces and cities widely established one-year short-term primary schools, enrolling out-of-school children aged nine to twelve, providing them with one year of compulsory education. In addition, elementary primary schools were promoted, the original grades and quotas of primary schools were enriched, the two-shift system was vigorously implemented, private schools were improved, and mobile teaching was piloted. By the end of this phase, at least 80% of the total number of school-age children nationwide should have received at least one year of equivalent education.

B. The second phase, from January 1940 to July 1944. During these four years, in addition to continuing to operate in accordance with the methods of the previous phase, all one-year short-term primary schools will gradually be converted into two-year short-term primary schools, enrolling out-of-school children aged eight to twelve, and providing them with education. By the end of this phase, at least 80% of the total number of school-age children nationwide should have received at least two years of equivalent education.

C. The third phase, starting in August 1944. All two-year short-term primary schools should gradually be converted into four-year primary schools, so that all school-age children nationwide should receive at least four years of compulsory education. After this plan was finalized, all laws and regulations related to the plan, such as the Outline of Provisional Measures for Compulsory Education, Detailed Implementation Rules, Measures for Dividing Primary School Districts in Cities and Counties, Measures for Investigating School-Age Children, Measures for Implementing the Two-Shift System, Measures for Implementing Mobile Education, Measures for Improving Private Schools, Regulations for One-Year Short-Term Primary Schools, Regulations for Two-Year Short-Term Primary Schools, Organizational Regulations for the National Compulsory Education Committee, Regulations for Compulsory Education Inspectors in Provinces and Cities, and Regulations for Compulsory Education Inspectors in Counties and Cities, were all successively formulated, promulgated, and implemented. The implementation plan for compulsory education is thus fully prepared.

During the period of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, in view of the fact that promoting compulsory education is a fundamental undertaking, it should be expedited. Therefore, this year, all provinces were ordered to establish two-year short-term primary schools in advance, and a second-phase plan for promoting compulsory education was formulated, striving to popularize compulsory education and complete it as soon as possible within the specified period, so as to consolidate the foundation for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. Recently, the central government also promulgated the organizational outline of county-level organizations, stipulating that a national school should be established in each Bao according to the Baojia system, and a central school should be established in each township "Zhen", so that compulsory education and mass education can be promoted simultaneously, and political education will be integrated to strengthen the driving force and quickly complete the construction of basic-level politics, culture, and economy.

### Guo Youshou Publishes Report on the Situation of Compulsory Education in Sichuan Province

(Former Chongqing News) Guo Youshou, the Director of the Sichuan Education Department, recently published an article titled "Overview of Compulsory Education in Sichuan Province," detailing the number of compulsory education schools in various counties and cities in Sichuan Province in 1938: 6,652 schools, 12,800 classes, and 493,235 students. The central government subsidy and the province's own compulsory education funds: in 1938, the central government subsidized 100,003 yuan, and the province raised 100,000 yuan. According to statistics, there are 6,807,133 school-age children in the province, of whom 1,385,241 have been enrolled, and 5,411,892 have not been enrolled. The province has decided to implement the new county system from March 1940, integrate political education, establish national schools in Bao, and central schools in townships. Regarding the required teachers and funds for implementation, the provincial government will comprehensively plan and train them. A six-year plan is currently being drafted to promote it decisively.

### Inter-Port Football Match: Hong Kong Team Decides to Come to Shanghai; Hong Kong Team is All Westerners; Three Matches to be Played in Shanghai

(Hong Kong United Press) The secretary of the Hong Kong Football Association announced today that Hong Kong has decided to accept Shanghai's invitation to send a team to Shanghai for an inter-port match during the Lunar New Year. The selection committee met tonight to discuss the candidates for the team, but no decision was made. The selection will be postponed, because some team members are in the reserve team of the Chamber of Commerce and must first obtain the approval of the Hong Kong government to take leave to go to Shanghai during the Lunar New Year. In general, this leave will be no problem, because the number of people asking for leave is extremely small. The fact that Chinese players such as Li Huitang are not selected this time (according to the Chinese players' refusal to come to Shanghai) will disappoint Shanghai. After the Hong Kong team comes to Shanghai, it will follow the usual practice of playing three matches: (1) Inter-port match (2) Against the Shanghai Chinese United Team (3) Against the Shanghai Military United Team. According to news from this port, Mr. Spike, the secretary of the Shanghai Westerners Football Club, stated that Shanghai has sent a letter of invitation for the Shanghai-Hong Kong inter-port match, but has not yet received a formal reply, so the specific measures are still difficult to determine.

### Great Victory of the Chinese Army in Northern Guangdong; Shanghai Citizens Thrilled and Jubilant; Joint Telegram to the Commander-in-Chief to Wish the Final Victory; Bond Prices Surge, Rarely Seen in Recent Times

The great victory of the Chinese army's counterattack in northern Guangdong, with more than 10,000 Japanese casualties, and the continuous progress on the Xiang, E, Jin, and Yu fronts have also been reported in recent days. The hearts of the people in Shanghai are extremely excited. Yesterday, the bond market soared sharply. The various national organizations in this city believe that at the beginning of the new year of 1940, the frontline military has achieved major victories, which proves that the future of China's resistance is bright and is on the rise. In addition to being excited, they jointly sent a telegram to the Military Commission in Chongqing to congratulate the frontline soldiers and express their condolences. The details are as follows:

Shanghai Citizens Jointly Send a Telegram to Congratulate

(Omitted above) We are pleased to hear of the great victory in northern Guangdong, with more than 10,000 Japanese casualties. We are extremely excited after hearing this. We hope that you will continue to make persistent efforts to eliminate the ugly captives, restore our homeland, strive for independent survival, and complete the great cause of national reconstruction. The Shanghai citizens cannot help but pray with incense. We respectfully send a telegram to congratulate you and express our gratitude. We hope you will accept it. The Shame and Honor Movement sends a telegram to Jiang to congratulate

The Shanghai All-Circles Shame and Honor Movement Committee congratulates the Supreme Commander and the frontline soldiers for the great victory of our army in northern Guangdong, and sends a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government, and forwards it to the frontline soldiers. This time, while our army was actively counterattacking in Guilin, the Japanese army transferred its elite forces to launch a fierce attack on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway, hoping to contain our forces and reverse the shame of its defeat in northern Hunan. Thanks to the Supreme Commander's decisive command and divine strategy, and the frontline soldiers' unanimous obedience, we created a second glorious record after the great victory in northern Hunan. The good news has spread, and we are overjoyed. The members of this committee, in addition to mobilizing all Shanghai citizens to cultivate their integrity, promote honor and shame, and to protect themselves, so as to make persistent efforts, eliminate the demons, and achieve the final victory, respectfully send our greetings and wish you success. The Shanghai All-Circles Shame and Honor Movement Committee kowtows and sings.

Unified Bond Prices Soar

The Ministry of Finance's maintenance of bond credibility has never changed. Although the tariff-guaranteed unified bonds have been forced to stop payment due to the interception of tax revenue, the eight times of repayment of principal and interest on the unified A, B, C, D, and E bonds, which are discounted and paid by the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture, have been set to be paid on January 30. As for the Shanghai securities market, because the government's maintenance of bond credibility has been consistent and the eighth repayment of principal and interest is approaching, and at the same time, the Chinese army in northern Guangdong has won a victory, the market is extremely excited. Therefore, bond buying has become popular and prices have soared. The closing prices for yesterday morning and afternoon are recorded as follows: Unified Type A: 60.06 yuan in the morning, 60.08 yuan in the afternoon; Type B: 51.35 yuan in the morning, 50.80 yuan in the afternoon; Type C: 49.25 yuan in the morning, 49.50 yuan in the afternoon; Type D: 48.15 yuan in the morning, 48.30 yuan in the afternoon; Type E: 48.85 yuan in the morning, 49 yuan in the afternoon. The soaring prices are truly rare in recent times.

Japanese Authorities Admit Defeat

The French Shanghai Daily reported on the 5th that, according to the Japanese military authorities, the Japanese army in Guangdong has achieved its goals. What are these goals? That is, to destroy all the defense works owned by the Chinese. According to the spokesman, he denied the rumors that the Japanese army was defeated miserably in northern Guangdong, but said that after the "victory," the Japanese army "voluntarily retreated" to some strategic strongholds. The spokesman finally said that the purpose of the Japanese army's current operations is not to occupy land, but only to consume the Chinese army.

### Colonel Becker Visits the Municipal Council; Pays Respects to the Chairman and General Manager

Those present also included the deputy general manager, Major General Aen, and Colonel Xiang Pei, the commander of the International Volunteer Corps.

### Japanese Warships Gather: Sixteen Vessels Anchored in the Huangpu River

Since the New Year, the number of Japanese ships in the Huangpu River has increased again. According to a reporter's investigation yesterday, there were 16 Japanese ships gathered, including the flagship Izumo, the gunboat Mother, the transport gunboat Tahlra, the ordnance ship Taiyo, and the rest were all transport ships, including the Wuling Maru, the Second Taishan Maru, the Third Xiang Maru, the Saga Maru, the Ryu Maru, the Aso Maru, the Tokyo Maru, the Kyokuto Maru, the Nenro Maru, the Nihonkai Maru, and the Fifth Keijin Maru. Among them, the Kyokuto Maru left Shanghai last night with military supplies.

### Large Batch of Wounded Japanese Soldiers Transported; About 1,000 Soldiers

According to a gentleman who works at the North Railway Station, a large number of wounded Japanese soldiers have been transported recently on both the Jinghu and Huhang lines, especially at night. There are at least three or four carriages, each carriage carrying about 20 to 30 wounded soldiers. Since New Year's Day, there have been about 1,000 soldiers, all of whom have been sent to wounded soldier hospitals in Hongkou, Zhabei, western Shanghai, and the southern city. Therefore, the wounded soldier hospitals in Shanghai are already overcrowded. It is also heard that a large number of wounded Japanese soldiers from Yixing, Zhejiang, have been transported to Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and other places for treatment.

### Moral Rearmament Movement: Widely Launched; Shanghai Propaganda Proceeds as Usual; Emphasis on Practice and Extending to Others

The Moral Rearmament Movement aims to transform society and rebuild the world, starting with the moral rearmament of individuals, eliminating corrupt habits, and changing bad lifestyles, with the four principles of absolute honesty, purity, unselfishness, and love as the guidelines for life. All countries in the world are now unanimously promoting it in order to save the world and increase the eternal happiness of mankind. The Moral Rearmament Movement in Shanghai made a large-scale promotion from the 1st to the 3rd of last month. The regular propaganda work is still proceeding as usual. The Eastern Radio Station broadcasts the Moral Rearmament Movement every day from 12:45 PM, and the Gospel Radio Station broadcasts it every Thursday from 8:30 PM (English), and every Saturday from 7:30 PM (Chinese). The Gospel also broadcasts Dr. Wang Wanbai's lecture "Impressions of Traveling in the United States" every day from 7 PM, which, in addition to reporting on the proceedings of the World Moral Rearmament Movement Conference, also includes many elucidations on the meaning of moral rearmament and reports on personal experiences. People in the movement recently received reports from cities such as Pingjin, Kunming, and Chongqing. The Moral Rearmament Movement in Chongqing is also widely launched in the mainland, and the promotion is quite smooth. The characteristic of the movement is that it does not adopt the form of organization, but is entirely based on the personal practice of enthusiastic participants and extending it to others.

### Shanghai's Poor Fortunes: Charity Groups Rush to Organize Winter Relief - Distributing Bread and Ginger Soup on Longmen Road - Planning to Establish a Shelter in Xujiahui

Since the winter solstice and the subsequent two cold waves, which resulted in the deaths of over a hundred people (the actual number is likely even higher), charitable figures in Shanghai have been paying close attention. They immediately began preparing to establish relief shelters and implement price controls on grain to aid the impoverished masses suffering from hunger and cold. It is now known that the Shanghai Charity Federation has already started work on providing both cooked meals and shelters.

Due to the great demand for space in Shanghai's foreign concessions, it has been impossible to find a suitable location. Therefore, it has been decided to change the plan to something similar to providing cooked meals, choosing a location to distribute two loaves of bread and a bowl of hot ginger soup to each person in the evenings to help them ward off the cold. It is said that the area around Longmen Road has been chosen as the distribution point, and the distribution will take place there every evening, starting on January 9th (the first day of the twelfth lunar month). The ginger soup will be prepared by the Renji Orphanage, and the bread will also be custom-made from a bakery. The police will be dispatched at that time to maintain order. Finding a location for a shelter is even more difficult than finding a location for a soup kitchen. Only two factory sheds near the Xujiahui Catholic Church are available. Mr. Huang Hanzhi, Mr. Wen Lanting, and Mr. Guan Jiongzhi have already written to Father Zhong of the church to discuss the matter, and Mr. Zhu Zhiyao went to make contact yesterday. As soon as the negotiations are completed, they will begin preparations.

Fortunately, it will only be for three months. When the earth revives and the weather warms, the shelter will be closed. It is hoped that the police will also be willing to assist. Those who are often not reached by relief efforts but are actually experiencing great suffering in their lives are the...

Respectable Poor

These people often have husbands working in professions or many mouths to feed, and their income cannot cover their expenses, or they are suffering from poverty and illness. The hunger and cold they endure are no less severe than those of impoverished people wandering the streets. It is now heard that the Federation is extremely concerned about providing relief to the respectable poor, and is currently working to prevent them from freezing and starving. The benefits of this are as great as those of providing relief to the general poor. There are many impoverished people in Shanghai, and the funds needed for relief are considerable. Although the initial expenses will be covered by the Federation's remaining funds, Mr. Huang Hanzhi once said that...

Various Expenditures

were greatly reduced in the past, causing much resentment and criticism. Now, it is very comforting to have this kind of winter relief effort. However, the matter is important and funds are limited. If there are no donations to support it, it will still be difficult to maintain. Fortunately, there are many charitable people in Shanghai who will surely donate generously to this winter relief effort to help it succeed.

### Flat-Price Grain Program Imminent - Flat-Price Grain Committee Established Yesterday - Will Continue During the Lunar New Year

After the Shanghai People's Food Coordination Conference established a Flat-Price Grain Committee to be fully responsible for flat-price grain sales and fundraising, the Committee held its inaugural meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road. Chu Qiaqing, Wang Yuqing, Chen Ziyi, Zhang Nianxuan, Ma Shaoling, Ding Fangyuan, Zhu Yinjiang, Zhang Jiguang, Zhang Zemin, Guo Shun, Cao Xin, and others were present. Chu Qiaqing chaired the meeting, and Yang Youlong served as the secretary. The chairman first reported on the purpose of the meeting, and then the discussion began. The following resolutions were passed on the spot: (1) to draft articles of association and a declaration, (2) to appoint more passionate people as committee members, and (3) to actively solicit flat-price grain funds from all sectors of society. The Committee's address is on the second floor of 93 Guangdong Road. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.

Millions in Funding - Currently Being Raised

The Flat-Price Grain Committee has already purchased 16,000 bags of Saigon broken rice from the Shanghai market and has decided to hold flat-price grain sales in the near future. As for the specific methods of flat-price grain sales, the Flat-Price Grain Committee will decide tomorrow. In addition, it has telegraphed Saigon to order 15,000 bags of foreign rice, which will be loaded onto ships and transported to Shanghai, arriving around the end or beginning of the lunar month, in preparation for continuing the flat-price grain sales during the lunar New Year. Regarding raising donations for flat-price grain sales, a target of one million national currency has been tentatively set, and donations are already being solicited from all industries.

Continuing to Telegraph Orders for Foreign Rice to Regulate the Market

After the People's Food Regulation Association handled the registration for foreign rice orders, many groups, organizations, companies, and firms enthusiastically registered to order rice. In addition to already telegraphing Saigon to order 600 tons of high-quality rice, the Association immediately sent a second telegram to Saigon to continue ordering foreign rice. The quantity will be determined by the Purchasing Committee. As for the Shanghai Rice and Grain Trade Association's assessment of the market, because foreign rice has been arriving in recent days and the source of domestic rice has been cleared, the amount of rice stored in the two Shanghai concessions has gradually increased, and the price of rice has stabilized.

### Factory Association Fights for Certification of National Products - Presses the Ministry to Provide Equal Treatment with the Chamber of Commerce

The Shanghai National Products Factory Association requested the Ministry of Economic Affairs to grant equal treatment to national product groups in certifying national products for transit, as current regulations only allow the Chamber of Commerce to provide such certification. The original telegram stated: "To Minister Weng Jun of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Chongqing: When members of our association apply to join, they undergo strict investigation and are approved by the executive committee's resolution. Only purely national product factories that use national raw materials, or firms with no manufacturing plant, are allowed to join. Since the outbreak of the war, we have continued to operate according to the established rules. We note that the Ministry's 'Measures for Registration of Local Products at Customs' issued in 1935, lists both the Chamber of Commerce and the National Products Factory Association in its articles. We have seen reports that the Ministry's 'Measures for Preventing National Products Factories from Using Non-National Raw Materials and Inspecting Imported Local Products' only stipulate certification by the Chamber of Commerce. This may cause misunderstandings among the import inspection agencies in various provinces and ports. Therefore, we urgently request that the Ministry telegraph all cities, coastal defense areas, Saigon, Hong Kong, and Chinese Chambers of Commerce in overseas ports such as Nanyang, Little Luzon, Singapore, and Cebu, stating that all local products produced by national product factories within the Shanghai concessions, which are in transit or being imported, and which hold a certification letter from our association, should be treated equally to those certified by the Chamber of Commerce. All should be given convenience for promotion, to encourage production and increase resources. Our association is a specialized group for promoting national products and has always strictly supervised. All impure factories have long been rejected. This is stated in combination. The Shanghai National Products Factory Association respectfully submits."

### Opening of the Yangtze River - Reportedly to Occur on February 1st

The North-China Daily News reports: "A Japanese Navy spokesperson stated yesterday (the 4th) that Japanese officials are currently rushing to handle the matter of reopening the Yangtze River.

### After the Japanese Troops in Changshu Were Attacked - A Five-Day Search - City Closed for Two Hours Each Day - Over Three Hundred People Arrested

Since the Japanese troops in Changshu were attacked on New Year's Day, they have closed the city for a thorough search, which has lasted for five days without any progress. According to someone who has come from the area, since the 4th, the east, south, and west gates have been opened for two hours each day, from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM and from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Outside of these times, no one except Japanese soldiers is allowed to enter or exit. Even those who enter or exit during these times are subject to strict inspections. It is said that the residents of the city have been searched thoroughly for days, with some being searched three or four times a day. As a result, anyone with the slightest suspicion or with inconsistencies in their household registration is arrested and considered to be connected to the guerrillas. It is estimated that over three hundred people have been arrested in the past four or five days. They are currently being held in the City God Temple inside the west gate, guarded by Japanese soldiers who are often abusive. Among them are also some members of the puppet pacification team and puppet civil servants. The relevant puppet authorities have requested their release on bail, but this has not been approved. It is said that this incident occurred before dawn on New Year's Day, when guerrillas first killed the guards of the Japanese headquarters (located at the former county government site on Daoqian Street), and then charged in. The Japanese troops were unprepared, resulting in heavy casualties, which led to the closure of the city for a thorough search. It is now rumored that the Japanese claim to have obtained some clues. Because of this, the city gates will remain closed. The city is isolated from the outside, and residents are reluctant to enter or exit the city gates. The city is very desolate, lifeless, and prices are soaring. Vegetables are 30 cents per catty, and straw is 20-30 cents per bundle. Residents are extremely anxious.

### Citizen Associations in Various Districts Endorse Group Coal Purchases - Coal Prices Drive Up Other Prices - Efforts to Suppress Prices Are Essential

The Shanghai Municipal First Special District Citizen's Joint Meeting and the Second, Eighth, Twelfth, Fifteenth, Eighteenth, Twentieth, Twenty-fourth, Twenty-sixth, and Twenty-seventh District Branches jointly sent a letter to the General Association yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern, our city has a population of nearly four million, of which only a small number are able to provide for themselves without worry, and even fewer are actually wealthy. Therefore, high prices have a great impact on the livelihoods of ordinary people, and are also of great importance to social stability. While there are price limits in place for rice, the soaring price of coal, which is a...

Stimulus to Prices

and raises the prices of other commodities, is also worthy of attention. Recently, it was reported that your association's members, Zhang Yizhai, Liu Shenying, and Ge Futian, suggested that industrial users unite to purchase and transport coal as a group to ensure supply and suppress coal prices. This is an essential plan for the present situation. We have found that many prices on the market are rising due to the high price of coal.

Examples Abound

The price increases in hotels and bathhouses are common examples. The increased costs of factories and restaurants are also due to this. The price increases for pancakes and fried dough sticks are no different. Therefore, the rise in coal prices has a widespread impact on prices. Furthermore, the Engineering Bureau has specially approved price increases for public utilities such as electricity, tap water, and streetcars, which are also...

Affected by Coal Prices

In addition, the price of coal balls has been steadily rising and is now more than five times higher than before the war, making it difficult for ordinary citizens to make ends meet. It can be seen that the rise in coal prices has a profound impact on the general public. To suppress prices, it is necessary to first suppress coal prices. Suppressing coal prices is as important as suppressing rice prices. Our association and others express our unanimous support for the recommendation of your association's members, Zhang and others, to purchase coal as a group to stabilize prices. Given the need for people's livelihoods, we ask that you unite with all relevant parties to quickly develop concrete measures and implement them. We are infinitely hopeful."

### Ministry of Finance Approves Issuance of Aluminum Coins - In Denominations of One Cent and Five Cents - Central Mint Begins Minting

After the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks worked hard to regulate the shortage of cent coins and auxiliary coins and one-yuan notes in the Shanghai market, the panic over the shortage of cent coins has gradually subsided. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the Ministry of Finance has approved the Central Bank's proposal to issue one-cent and five-cent aluminum coins. The regulations for auxiliary coins have already been revised, and the Central Mint has been ordered to begin minting. These aluminum coins will have the same value as the one-cent and five-cent cent notes in the future. The purpose of issuing aluminum coins is to regulate the shortage of auxiliary coins, and aluminum coins are more durable than auxiliary coins.

### Over 40,000 Exposed Corpses Collected in Shanghai Last Year - All Collected and Buried by the Pushan Villa - Funding Greatly Needed for This Benevolent Act

According to the Shanghai Pushan Villa, the statistics for the collection of exposed corpses in the twelve months of last year are shocking. A reporter from the Datong News Agency has recorded the details as follows:

Over 40,000 Corpses Collected Last Year

According to the statistics, 5,852 corpses were collected and buried in January, 4,231 in February, 3,513 in March, 3,321 in April, 5,059 in May, 3,826 in June, 3,170 in July, 2,984 in August, 2,617 in September, 2,461 in October, 2,342 in November, and 2,709 in December. The total for the year reached 41,075.

Fewer Exposed Corpses Discovered

This is because the winter climate was not as severe as the winter of the previous year, so the total number of exposed corpses collected was lower than in the previous year. The total for the twelve months of the previous year was 10,618 adult male corpses, 4,371 female corpses, and 45,075 children's corpses, for a total of 60,064.

Rising Lumber Prices Make Coffins Expensive

Furthermore, due to the soaring price of lumber in recent times, each wooden coffin, which used to cost only three or four yuan, now costs at least thirteen or fourteen yuan. This has caused the Hall's finances to be stretched thin. The need for funds is even greater during the winter months. It is hoped that charitable people in society will donate generously.

### Japanese Troops Return to Posts on Bridges in Hongkou - Strict Inspection of Pedestrians and Vehicles - Situation North of Suzhou Creek Becomes Tense Again

According to someone who came from Hongkou, something happened in Yangshupu in eastern Shanghai a few days ago. As a result, the Japanese authorities ordered the military police to send out patrols and maintain a high level of alert. The sentry posts that had previously been removed from the bridges (such as Outer Hongqiao, Middle Hongqiao, Inner Hongqiao, Sikaizi Bridge, West Jiaxing Road Bridge, Oujia Road Bridge, etc.) were suddenly restored yesterday. The inspection of vehicles and pedestrians is very strict. At the same time, outside the bridges connecting the central district of the concession, such as Waibaidu Bridge, Zhapu Road Bridge, North Sichuan Road Bridge, and the gaps at Haining Road and Wensanshi Road, in addition to the Japanese naval guards, more Japanese police have been sent to guard the posts, and the situation has become tense again.

However, the Shanghai Postal Administration has continued to dispatch mail from Shanghai to Europe, only with a longer delivery time. The Administration issued Notice No. 1596 yesterday, stating: "Due to the war in Europe, the Administration will temporarily suspend the acceptance of airmail to Germany from today."

### Establishing Great Achievements - New Life for the Chinese Air Force - Aircraft Factory in the Yunnan Jungle - At Least 1,000 Japanese Aircraft Destroyed

The China Weekly Review reports: "Near the Burmese border, in the Yunnan jungle 1,200 miles from the nearest Japanese air force base, an American-run aircraft factory has been established. With a capital of four million yuan, it manufactures one aircraft per day. If Japanese aircraft dare to fly there, they will be met with...

Heavy Anti-Aircraft Fire and Fierce Attacks from Fighter Planes."

### Shanghai's Traffic Shortcut - Can Transfer via Jintang Island - No Need to Travel on Japanese Ships

The Tambay, a ship of the American company, China Merchants Navigation Company, was seized by the Japanese and repainted and renamed "Far East No. 4."

### Glucose Calcium Injection Causes Strong Reaction; Doctor Accuses Distributor of Negligence Causing Injury; This Medicine Is Sold Worldwide and Has Remained Unchanged; Court Orders Conclusion of Arguments and Sets Date for Pronouncement of Judgment

Zhiwei Company at No. 14 Bowuguan Road, established by Wu Zhiwei from Ningbo, is the sole distributor in China of Calcinm Cornorate (i.e., glucose calcium), produced by the well-known American pharmaceutical company, Pro Strong Company. Recently, Wu Zhiwei was sued by Yu Tingxiang, a doctor, in the First Special Court's Criminal Division, represented by lawyers Qian Xingzhong and others, for negligence causing injury and other charges. The indictment briefly stated that the plaintiff, Yu Tingxiang, after graduating from the Tongji University School of Medicine,

Has Practiced Medicine for Eighteen Years and also serves as an examining physician for the Hua An Life Insurance Company in this city. The defendant, Wu Zhiwei, once sent an employee, Tian Yinglong, to promote the glucose calcium, one hundred ampoules (each containing ten cc), to the plaintiff. On October 17th, the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], the plaintiff, suffering from a cold and cough, asked his colleague, Mr. Lu Jinwen, at the company to inject ten cc of the aforementioned medicine into his buttocks. Half an hour later, the plaintiff felt cold all over and trembled violently. At the same time, his arms and legs were in severe pain, and he even partially lost consciousness,

His condition suddenly became abnormal. Later, his colleagues at the company gave him a cup of brandy and about five or six cups of plain water, and he gradually began to feel hot and sweat. It took three days and three nights for him to recover slightly. Several colleagues at Hua An Insurance Company witnessed this terrifying state. To this day, the plaintiff still shows signs of mental fatigue. He also recalled that on October 14th, 1939, he injected the same medicine for the same ailment into a patient, Xu Duzhou, and the same terrifying state occurred. Under these circumstances, the mental suffering endured by the plaintiff cannot be expressed in words. Moreover, the reputation of the plaintiff among patients has been severely

Affected Negatively. The plaintiff also had Dr. Lu Shifa, a forensic doctor, inject the same medicine of the defendant for the same ailment, and his patient suffered the same experience. The Zhiwei Company, founded by the defendant, is the exclusive distributor of Pro Strong Company's products in China, but it is completely unconcerned about the necessary precautions regarding pharmaceuticals, causing harm to the plaintiff's health, and violating Article 284, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, the crime of professional negligence causing injury. The portion of the incidental civil lawsuit is temporarily reserved, etc. This case was heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Shi Cong, who took the seat in Criminal Court No. 8 to summon the defendant, Wu Zhiwei, who also arrived with his defense lawyer, Li Zemin. Then, the plaintiff, Yu Tingxiang, through his agent lawyer, Qian Xingzhong, stated the

Reasons for the Lawsuit. Afterward, the defendant, Wu Zhiwei's, defense reason was generally that the glucose calcium produced by the American Pro Strong Company that he distributes is widely sold, all over the world. This medicine has remained unchanged for a long time. After this case occurred, the defendant sent a letter to the American Pro Strong Company to inquire, and they have already sent a reply to the plaintiff with a detailed explanation, etc. The court verified the confessions and ordered the conclusion of arguments for this case, setting the date for the pronouncement of judgment on the 11th of this month.

He also rented the attic upstairs of the store as a storage room and dormitory for employees. Recently, the owner of the Nanyang Shoe Store, Qu Yuchang, transferred the store's bottom line and assets to Wang Qingyu, a Ningbo native, and changed the brand to Dahua while still running the hat business. Qu then negotiated with Yu to terminate the rental of the shop window. After removing the copper bars, chrome hat racks, and other items installed in the shop window, and transporting them back, the transferee, Wang Qingyu, suddenly reported to the French police, accusing Yu Xianqing of stealing business equipment. The police summoned Yu, but Yu did not appear. Yu then appointed lawyer Wu Xiangxian as his agent and filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court's Criminal Division against Wang Qingyu, accusing him of malicious false accusation of theft, requesting a legal investigation. This case was heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Zhang Minsheng. The plaintiff, Yu Xianqing, was represented by his lawyer, who stated the reasons for the lawsuit, saying that the plaintiff was afraid that he would be arrested and subjected to severe torture by the police because the defendant had reported him to the police station. Therefore, the plaintiff dared not appear in court. He also presented ledgers and invoices to prove that the items he removed were his own property, etc. The defendant, Wang Qingyu, accompanied by his defense lawyer, Chen Haisen, appeared in court and argued that the items removed by the plaintiff were the assets that the defendant had received in the transfer. Since the plaintiff did not appear today, he requested that a warrant be issued for his arrest or that the trial be suspended, etc. After reviewing the arguments, Judge Zhang announced that the case would be adjourned for further investigation.

### Finance: Hong Kong Banks Continue to Sell; US Dollar Exchange Rate Falls Below 8 Yuan

The foreign exchange market yesterday showed no changes in HSBC's listed rates. The private market for British and American currencies suddenly reported that the government would tighten control over currency exchange on the 8th of this month, causing Hong Kong merchants' funds to flow rapidly into the Shanghai market. Furthermore, there were relatively recent news of Sino-Japanese peace terms, which led the general Chinese merchants with long positions to close their positions in groups. The morning opening was affected by the sharp drop of 2.25 points in the British and American currency exchange rates, resulting in a state of loose British and tight American currencies. Later, Chinese banks again acted on behalf of Hong Kong banks to sell heavily. In addition, foreign banks had little appetite for buying, and American banks, such as Chase, intended to sell, making the position even more abundant, and the loose trend was difficult to suppress. By 9:45 AM, the US dollar exchange rate had fallen below 8 yuan, reaching 8.0625 yuan. The pound sterling also rose to 4 shillings 9 and 3/8 pence. However, HSBC and Sassoon started buying, and at the same time, many foreign firms also closed out forward US dollar positions, so it once returned to 4 shillings 8 and 1/2 pence and 7.875 yuan. After that, those who profited were content, and speculators suddenly came to sell. By the afternoon, the price could not be sustained due to further selling from Hong Kong and prevalent peace rumors in the market. By the evening close, it reached a loose price of 4 shillings 9 and 15/16 pence and 8.09375 yuan. As a result, the pound sterling fell by 2 and 3/4 pence, and the US dollar hardened by 3 and 1/8 cents. The futures market trend was no different from the spot market.

Pound Sterling Approaching 5 Shillings

In the early morning, due to the large London settlement, the recent term continued to shrink by 3/8 pence, the distant term fell by 1/4 pence, the New York silver price remained flat, the London gold price was undetermined, and the exchange rates of the pound sterling against US, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The US dollar sharply contracted by 2.25 points against the pound sterling, did not change against Shanghai, and plummeted by 1 and 3/8 pence against France. The central listed exchange rates remained the same. At the morning opening, the banks' spot selling prices were 4 shillings and 3/4 pence for the pound sterling and 7.75 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous close, the pound sterling was looser by 1/8 pence, and the US dollar was harder by 3/8 cents. Due to the decline in the exchange rate, major Chinese banks such as the Bank of East Asia first acted on behalf of Hong Kong banks to sell heavily after the opening, and the market immediately became loose. By the time HSBC's listed rates were announced without changes and the silver equalization tax was announced to be slightly more than half a penny, the pound sterling had risen to 4 shillings and 1/8 pence, and the US dollar had also hardened to 7.875 yuan. After that, foreign banks had even less appetite for buying, and American banks, such as Chase, intended to sell, so the loose trend accelerated. By 9:50 AM, the pound sterling had hardened to 4 shillings 3/8 pence, and the US dollar had also broken through the 8 yuan mark, reaching 8.0625 yuan. However, HSBC suddenly had the intention to buy, absorbing fellow banks at the current order of 4 shillings and 1/4 pence, causing the situation to suddenly soften. Later, Western merchant Sassoon also followed suit and bought, and the foreign firms also rushed to buy forward US dollars when they saw the scene, so the process continued to tighten. By 10:10 AM, the pound sterling had fallen back to 4 shillings and 1/2 pence, and the US dollar had also shrunk to 7.875 yuan. Afterwards, there were fewer buyers, and speculators suddenly sold, so the position became more abundant again, and the market trend hardened again. By 10:45 AM, the pound sterling had risen again to 4 shillings and 1/8 pence, and the US dollar had hardened again to 7.96875 yuan. After that, there were fewer trades, and the situation became stable. By the midday close, the banks' spot selling prices were 4 shillings and 1/16 pence for the pound sterling and 7.96875 yuan for the US dollar, 1/8 pence looser for the pound sterling and 3/16 cents harder for the US dollar than the morning opening.

Chinese Merchants to Sell Again in the After-Market

In the after-market, due to continued selling from Hong Kong and Chinese merchants continuing to close their positions, the market trend continued to harden. The pound sterling immediately rose to 4 shillings and 3/8 pence, and the US dollar hardened to 8.0625 yuan. During that time, foreign banks Youli and the Shanghai branch of Chinese banks had absorbed some. Later, it once turned stable. It was difficult to settle at the upper price. After entering the market, the atmosphere of Sino-Japanese peace rumors was quite strong, and Chinese merchants came to sell again, so it became slightly harder again. By the evening close, the banks' spot selling prices were 4 shillings and 1/16 pence for the pound sterling and 8.09375 yuan for the US dollar, and the forward month was 4 shillings and 3/8 pence for the pound sterling and 8.03125 yuan for the US dollar. As a result, the spot and forward rates were looser by 2 and 3/4 pence for the pound sterling and harder by 3 and 1/8 cents for the US dollar than the previous day.

### Rumors Intensify: Gold Market Plunges into Selling Frenzy - Already Entering the 4,100 Yuan Mark -

Yesterday, the spot gold market continued its disastrous decline, becoming unbearable to witness, already plunging into the 4,100 yuan mark. This was mainly due to the exchange rate moving towards a looser trend. A telegraph from a certain source indicated hopes for an early end to the Sino-Japanese war, adding to the market's unease. As for the day's situation, the market opened lower due to the weak exchange rate, falling by 36 yuan to open at 4,090 yuan. Subsequently, as the exchange rate continued to strengthen and gold firms rushed to sell, even though local buyers attempted to support the market, the declining trend was inevitable, pushing the price down another 15 yuan. Then, due to a sudden tightening of the exchange rate, coupled with massive absorption of Hong Kong dollars and rampant speculation by numerous retail investors, the price briefly surged to 4,120 yuan. Later, as the exchange rate eased again and local buyers stopped purchasing, many retail investors liquidated their long positions, causing the midday closing price to remain at only 4,095 yuan. In the afternoon, the underlying trend initially stabilized due to continued support from local buyers. However, ultimately, as the exchange rate continued to loosen and the atmosphere in the market was heavily influenced by hopes for peace, investor confidence failed to recover. Furthermore, the pressure to sell from gold firms and securities houses drove the price down to a low of 4,060 yuan. As a result, the market closed at 4,063 yuan, a sharp drop of 63 yuan compared to the previous day. The post-market trend became increasingly weak, with transactions occurring as low as 4,050 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was approximately 2,000 taels. Silver jewelry prices fell by another 5 yuan, while customs gold prices remained stable.

Spot Gold Plunges 63 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (10 taels) initially opened weak due to the strengthening exchange rate and fragile investor sentiment, leading to widespread calls to sell. In addition, many buyers were cautious and observing the market, causing the price to drop below the 4,100 yuan level. At 9:30 AM, a money exchange house initially sold 20 taels to a gold firm at 4,090 yuan, down 36 yuan from the previous day. Shortly after, a money exchange house bought over 100 taels on behalf of a client, quickly rebounding by 15 yuan. Another money exchange house bought 20 taels from a securities house at 4,105 yuan. Subsequently, due to the continued weak exchange rate and aggressive selling from gold firms and securities houses, the market once again declined, falling back to 4,090 yuan. At that time, a silver shop also bought on behalf of Hong Kong buyers, briefly recovering to 4,100 yuan. Later, as the exchange rate loosened further, selling pressure intensified, and buyers became scarce, causing the price to drop by 25 yuan. A securities house sold 10 taels to a gold firm at 4,075 yuan. Afterwards, the exchange rate suddenly tightened, and two money exchange houses rushed to buy on behalf of clients, causing speculative longs to ramp up prices, soaring by 45 yuan. A money exchange house bought 30 taels from a securities house at 4,120 yuan. Later, as the exchange rate loosened again, buying interest suddenly waned, and securities houses and silver shops resumed heavy selling, with many retail investors liquidating their positions, causing the price to drop by 30 yuan. A securities house traded 20 taels with another securities house at 4,090 yuan. Later, a securities house covered its short positions at a lower price, pulling the price up by 15 yuan. A securities house bought 20 taels from a silver shop at 4,105 yuan. Near the close, a silver shop and a gold firm sold 20 taels to another silver shop at 4,100 yuan. Simultaneously, silver shops traded 70 taels with each other at 4,095 yuan. The midday closing price was 4,095 yuan. In the afternoon, the market initially opened 10 yuan lower, with gold firms trading 20 taels with each other at 4,085 yuan. Later, a money exchange house slightly recovered 8 yuan, but the exchange rate weakened again, and gold firms and silver shops resumed selling, dropping the price by 23 yuan. A gold firm sold 30 taels to a money exchange house at 4,070 yuan. Later, a money exchange house bought on behalf of Hong Kong buyers, and the exchange rate stabilized, causing retail investors to gradually support the market, pushing the price up by 25 yuan. Money exchange houses traded 20 taels with each other at 4,095 yuan. Afterwards, the exchange rate loosened again, Hong Kong buyers became satiated, and gold firms and a certain securities house suppressed prices and sold, causing a sharp drop of 35 yuan. A silver shop sold 20 taels to a securities house at 4,060 yuan. Near the close, the price rose by 3 yuan, with a money exchange house buying 20 taels from a gold firm at 4,063 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price fell by another 63 yuan compared to the previous day. The post-market trend became increasingly weak, and money exchange houses sold off some holdings, falling to as low as 4,050 yuan. Throughout the day, the price fluctuated by 60 yuan.

The price at the Xin Tong Hang was the same as the previous price, with the buying price reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Continue to Fall

Yesterday, foreign currencies weakened further due to abundant supply from Hong Kong. Demand for British and American gold pounds was extremely scarce, while the supply of gold notes was frequent, causing market prices to plummet. In the morning, British gold notes fell to 46.5 yuan, and American gold notes fell to 12.69 yuan. The market loosened further in the afternoon, falling sharply. In the evening market, British gold notes fell further to 45 yuan, and American gold notes fell to 12.37 yuan.

### Securities: Domestic and Foreign Bonds Both Show Strength, Bulls Sharpen Their Swords

The unofficial securities market was very strong yesterday, with rumors of peace said to be coming from London, although details were scarce and sources were mostly foreign banks. Type E bonds surged past 9 yuan, and Type C bonds approached 50 yuan. Experienced players liquidated excess long positions, causing market fluctuations and preventing a straight upward trend. It is only a question of time before the price exceeds 50 yuan, based on market sentiment and the environment. Trading was relatively active yesterday, with Sheng Da continuing to buy aggressively, and Lianhe, Tong Kang, Kang Yuan, and No. 38 also buying. Tong Shun, Hengfu, Lianyi, and Juxin saw some long liquidation, while Da Feng initially sold and then bought.

Market prices gradually rose by 0.3-0.6 yuan, with a total turnover of approximately 1.2 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

London, 4th Telegram: Today, the listed market prices of Chinese foreign bonds saw a sharp rise due to the atmosphere of Sino-Japanese peace. Despite Japanese restrictions on Chinese trade last year, the results were still positive, increasing hopes for peace. Crisp rose by half a pound to 25.5 pounds, and Reorganization Loan (British Issue) rose by one and a half pounds to 37 pounds. The rest remained stable.

London, 4th Telegram: Today's market prices of British Far East companies' stocks saw mixed ups and downs.

Stock Transactions: 30 shares of Qing Feng Yarn Factory were traded at a price of 48 yuan.

Yesterday, the stock market at the General Chamber of Commerce continued its upward trend. Almost all rubber stocks rose to new highs. As reported the previous day, many low-priced stocks, such as Karen-Dandenong, Chen Shi, and Bang, were very popular, overshadowing higher-priced stocks. However, compared to the recent unique surge in these smaller stocks, the proportional undervaluation of these higher-priced stocks is undeniable. Among industrial stocks, China Merchants' stock was the most actively traded, closing with buyers at 8.7 yuan. Ewo Cotton Mills stock stood firm at 29 yuan, and Jardine Matheson advanced to 225 yuan due to rumors of dividends.

### Oil Market: Dalian Oil Has Arrived, Leading to Softening Crude Oil Prices

Yesterday, the oil market was filled with pessimistic sentiments. Soybean oil saw no transactions throughout the day, as a batch of soybean oil from Dalian had arrived in port, totaling approximately 1,200-1,300 barrels (some say 1,800 barrels), causing a blow to investor confidence. Currently, there are hopes that the authorities in Dalian will continue to release oil, which could alleviate the situation for the residents of the isolated island. However, sellers were unwilling to sell at low prices due to high costs, so the price remained unchanged. Peanut oil prices softened as a result, and Hong Kong buyers were also observing the market. Only 10 barrels of Jiangbei crude oil were traded at 97 yuan, down 3 yuan from the previous day. 30 barrels of Qingdao crude oil were traded at the original price of 103 yuan.

### Grains: Rice Supply Stable, Still Needs to Pass Through Hongkou

Yesterday, over 1,000 bags of early and late rice from Nan Gang and other inland sources continued to arrive in Hongkou, while goods from the Sujia Road area were still scarce. However, it was heard that after repeated negotiations by the authorities of the concession, a certain party will release goods for transport soon. Since the amount of rice seized by a certain party this time was substantial, temporary relaxation may be possible. This may strike a blow to the other party, as farmers in the interior would rather store grain and sell it in large quantities when needed, rather than speculate, making it difficult to plunder. On the other hand, shipments of foreign rice continued to arrive, and goods ordered by the Light Adjustment Committee and others were also plentiful, so market sentiment showed no intention of holding firm, with everyone looking to sell. Goods that had been out of the market for a long time were also being offered for sale. Sales improved after noon, with local shops becoming active again, but buying interest was weak, and the market saw no significant changes. Near noon, there were sudden bulk transactions, and the situation gradually became lively, with prices rising. However, due to the congestion of goods in the market, it was difficult to secure enough supply, so the sales volume was good, with total sales exceeding 10,000 bags, but closing prices for japonica, indica, domestic rice, and foreign rice only increased by 0.1-0.3 yuan. Chang Kun high-grade japonica remained at 40 yuan, while Nan Gang early and late rice were only 36.5 yuan and 36 yuan, Saigon was 36.5 yuan and 36.3 yuan, broken rice was 32.3 yuan, and inferior rice was 29.8 yuan. The price situation was similar for other varieties. See the price list for details.

Yesterday, foreign rice was absorbed by local shops, and the market became more active. The fixed price for No. 1 Saigon was still 46.3-46.4 yuan, which was over 1 yuan higher than the market return price of 45 yuan, so the previous three or four telegraphs were not properly delivered. However, another 500 tons of broken Saigon were ordered at 34.8 yuan, with shipment expected around the 20th. The spot price for 4,000 bags was 36.75 yuan for No. 1 Saigon, 35.5 yuan for No. 2, and 32.2-30.06 yuan for broken rice, up 0.2-0.3 yuan from the previous day.

Yesterday, another 3,798 bags of foreign rice arrived on the Taikoo Company's Shandong轮 from Hong Kong. It was heard that a French vessel was directly loading a large shipment of foreign rice from Saigon, and the exact amount will be reported after the vessel arrives in Shanghai.

### Flour and Wheat Markets Stabilize, Qingdao Traders Active in Buying Lower-Grade Flour

Wheat Flour: Yesterday, the price for No. 2 Flour Mill remained unchanged at 9 yuan, and the upward trend gradually subsided. Spot sales in this street saw a sudden increase of 0.3 yuan, making buying interest less enthusiastic, while the price for traders reached 9.5 yuan, and buying interest from traders was not very strong. As a result, Qingdao traders focused on buying lower-grade flour, with approximately 20,000 bags traded, including Blue Cannon at 8.4 yuan, Red Peony at 8.9 yuan, Fufeng White Bag Flour at 7 yuan, and returned Che Chuan brand flour at 9.4-9.2 yuan. After a period of excitement the day before, the market for Japanese flour became sluggish yesterday. Some long positions in Phoenix brand flour for January were liquidated, with an opening price of only 9.056 yuan, later rising to 9.1 yuan, up slightly from the previous day. 8,300 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin today, and another 3,000 bags were shipped to Hong Kong.

Wheat: Yesterday, the wheat market also stabilized. Although some shipments arrived sporadically from the Suxi area, the amount was very small. Sellers were unwilling to sell easily due to high production costs and transportation difficulties, while mills had ordered foreign wheat several times because domestic wheat supply was insufficient. Although the foreign wheat orders had been announced, sellers were still unwilling to lower the price of domestic wheat. As a result, wheat from Changshu, Wuxi, and Suzhou was priced at 15.5 yuan, and wheat from Zhenjiang was priced at 15.3 yuan. Fuxin Mill bought 6,000 bags, and Fufeng Mill bought 4,000 bags. The market was in a state of ferment.

### Yarn and Cotton: Bulls Exit, Cotton Yarn Prices Fall Again

The yarn market weakened, and prices fell again. This was due to the exchange rate continuing to weaken, causing investor confidence to dissipate. At the same time, real demand remained weak, and speculators expected the exchange rate to weaken further after the new year. Therefore, they were disappointed that the exchange rate was not tight, but rather loose. Some also said that mills were considering opening up yarn supplies, which discouraged bulls, who sold off their holdings and liquidated their positions. The market became increasingly soft, while the situation for raw cotton remained strong. Yesterday, 500 pieces of yarn arrived from Ningbo, 1,257 pieces were shipped to Tianjin, and 55 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.

Spot yarn opened higher in the morning, continuing the weak momentum from the previous day. The market lacked buyers and had more sellers, so the trading volume was not as strong as the previous day. As a result, those who usually speculated on the open market reversed course and sold off their positions. The opening price was 748 yuan, down 5.5 yuan from the previous day. Shortly after, it was heard that the exchange rate continued to weaken, and selling pressure intensified, causing the market to plummet to 735 yuan. By the close, it was heard that the exchange rate had slightly strengthened, and short sellers covered their positions, causing the price to rise slightly. The total trading volume for half the day was 1,905 bales. The price for 20-count Shuangma yarn fell by 12.5 yuan, Shuangqiu fell by 15 yuan, and Tiannu fell by 16 yuan. The amount of each type bought by various traders is listed below:

Local Traders: 1,500 bales, Hong Kong: 330

Inland: 40, Southeast Asia: 15

Hunan: 20, Total: 1,905

### Yarn Sales Slow, Cotton Transactions Weaken

Transactions for domestic cotton weakened. Inter-dealer buying and selling was not as active as the previous day. Although foreign cotton was stable and prices did not fall, yarn sales were slow, and mills were hesitant, causing the market to be soft. 1,011 bales of Tonghua cotton arrived from Northern Jiangsu, and 2,678 bales arrived from Beisha. The situation for spot cotton is listed below:

Huocao Bag: 162.00, Traded by Local Traders: 747 bales

Nantai: 164.00, Traded by Local Traders: 301 bales

Huocao Bag: 166.50, Traded by Zhaoxing: 345 bales

Tongzhou: 14.00, Traded by Local Traders: 100 bales

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: New York cotton prices initially surged in the morning due to buying from overseas cotton merchants. Later, the market weakened due to hedging by Southern traders and short selling. As a result, closing prices fell by 35 basis points compared to the previous day. Indian cotton was expected to rise by over 5 Rupees, Egyptian cotton fell by 40-50 basis points, and Liverpool rose by over 10 士.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton: Due to recent exchange rate fluctuations and rumors, various cotton prices in the city reversed from rising to falling, resulting in quiet transactions. Mills were also hesitant about purchasing raw cotton due to weak yarn prices. Japanese traders were also hesitant. The following are the factory prices based on an exchange rate of 8 yuan for the US dollar:

20-count American Middling: 214.50

Same: 230.25

21-count Same: 241.35

Same: 135.35

42-count Same: 144.75

Same: 137.05

### North-South Goods: Hawthorn Slices Decline

Hawthorn slices have arrived recently with three to four hundred pieces, and the market has softened. Yesterday, the fruit traders put out a hundred pieces of clean goods at 33.5 yuan. The price has dropped by around 3 yuan. Rough goods are holding at 30 yuan, but have not been traded.

### Seafood: Pepper Prices Weaken

The purchase volume of pepper has been gradually slowing down recently, and the market has softened. This is also due to the weakening of the exchange rate, making the price more favorable. Yesterday, No. 1 black pepper was sold at 90 yuan, black large pepper at 92 yuan, Wen Dao white pepper at 155 yuan, and Dutch at 142 yuan.

Short Talk

### What to Talk About?

— Huang Jiayin

"You're editing Free Talk? Then what are you going to talk about in your Free Talk?"

Knowing that someone would definitely ask this, I might as well state a few things here myself.

As the name suggests, a supplement called "Free Talk" is of course meant to be a casual conversation, talking about everything. But there's one thing I really want to state here: Free Talk is definitely not nonsensical chatter, and Free Talk is even less about rambling nonsense.

We know that we exist in a society, and we are living our lives, so what we will focus on is society and life. We hope that Free Talk can provide some of the knowledge needed in life, raise the general interest in society, increase the joy of life, and promote the light of the world.

In the universe, humans are a tiny species, but they are not useless. If we can make good use of our own strength, we can create much happiness; conversely, we can also create much disaster.

We have the same view of Free Talk. Free Talk is a small garden, but prosperity and desolation are entirely up to human effort. We hope that Free Talk can become a place of rest for the minds of every reader.

We admit that we, like anyone else, have our prejudices and weaknesses, but we are willing to accept any well-intentioned criticism and guidance with the most humble attitude. We are willing to do our best to eliminate the ignorance, superstition, and forces of darkness in the world, and to continue this never-ending work. We hope that we can stand on the side of enlightened thought, the pursuit of truth, the development of freedom, and the creation of light. Our ultimate goal is to make this world a more touching, more rational, more beautiful, and happier place.

Therefore, starting today, Free Talk has the following minimum requirements:

Do not make aimless moans, do not write harmful articles.

### Declaration of Human Rights

— Huang Jiade

The great modern British thinker H.G. Wells recently collaborated with several friends to draft a "Declaration of Human Rights," which was published in the London Times in the form of a letter. The contents are summarized as follows:

"Everyone has the right to obtain nourishment, housing, medicine, and care. He has the right to receive full education, making him a useful citizen who cares about public affairs. He and his private property should be protected by the police and the law. He should receive

should receive full protection against any slander or defamation that distresses or harms him. He can freely engage in any legitimate occupation. He can freely travel anywhere in the world at his own expense. He has the right to do business. If he has not been accused of committing a crime, he should not be imprisoned for more than three weeks, and if he has not been publicly tried in court, he should not be imprisoned for more than three months; this does not apply to those with legal proof of mental illness. A person should not be subjected to any surgery that stops reproductive function unless he expresses his consent. If he is living in imprisonment, he should not be threatened with excessive silence, noise, light, or darkness, so as to cause mental distress. If he voluntarily fasts or goes on hunger strike, people should not force him to eat, nor should they prevent him from starving. If he commits a military crime, the maximum penalty he should receive is imprisonment for no more than fifteen years or the death penalty. The clauses and principles contained in this declaration should be specified in detail in the legal code. This declaration includes past declarations related to human rights and should become the fundamental law of mankind worldwide in the future."

Is this another utopia, an ideal state? No. The main points of this declaration have probably already appeared in other declarations related to human rights in the past. What is mentioned here are the minimum rights that every human being should enjoy. But what kind of treatment do male and female citizens in many modern countries in the world receive from their governments today? The heartbreaking phenomenon caused by inhumane and human rights-stripping acts is shocking and deeply saddening.

Mr. Wells has already set down some fundamental principles for human society. When the dark clouds of war and turmoil that surround the world dissipate, and when all peoples use human culture instead of violence as the basis for resolving difficulties and disputes, we hope that these fundamental principles will be universally applied in all countries of the world. We hope that the strategies proposed by Mr. Wells will spread to all places, be adopted as teaching materials in all schools, and be read by everyone. We hope that these fundamental principles will grow in everyone's heart, like green plants growing towards the sunlight.

### The First Year of the Second European War: Christmas Scenes in Paris and London

— Shi Tao

The outbreak of the European War has already passed several months, and everything seems quite calm. Although German floating mines are so active, the Maginot and Siegfried Lines remain unbelievably desolate. British planes scatter propaganda leaflets instead of bombs, and Germany even presents umbrellas to Chamberlain on the French front. Economic warfare is a characteristic of modern warfare, and this statement is gradually becoming apparent in the Second European War. Under the wartime system, the people of Britain and France are welcoming the first Christmas of this great war. One would imagine that they would be living a very melancholic and terrifying life, but no, Christmas is joyful, and Christmas finally paints a layer of harmonious color in their hearts.

Paris, Still Celebrating as Usual

The French seem strangely indifferent to the war on the front lines. They believe that the economic war of the entire nation is more important than anything else. It is difficult to find significant reports from the front lines, while the rear is constantly planning to normalize daily life. Their minds are filled with slogans such as "Ending the Emergency" and "Normalization."

Therefore, Christmas during wartime is the same as usual, with nothing special about it. The streets are bustling with open-air stalls, displaying many mouth-watering turkeys and delicious, colorful wines. These foods are being bought by passersby as if they were flying off the shelves. The streets of Paris everywhere present a joyful and lively scene.

Eating, drinking, and dancing are the only constant embellishments of the French Christmas. Many soldiers are granted special permission to return from the grim front lines to the flower-like Paris. They happily enjoy themselves with their wives and children. Although these soldiers on leave from the front lines are on vacation, they still cannot take off their uniforms when going out. Therefore, a characteristic of this year's Christmas in Paris is that the dance halls and restaurants are filled with military uniforms.

Since the beginning of the war, the most lively places in Paris have been open until 11:00 PM, but now a notice has been issued to extend the closing time to 12:00 midnight starting from Christmas Eve. Parisians do not like to celebrate Christmas at home. They have a habit of going out to celebrate Christmas with others, so taverns, restaurants, and other places are quickly fully booked. On that day, the restaurants in the city are flooded with groups of men, women, old, and young, drinking fine wine, chewing on delicacies, and enjoying the pleasures of life. Even in wartime, people there can still eat and drink as they please. Paris is truly worthy of being a great city for entertainment.

This is partly due to the impregnability of the Maginot Line, and partly to prove how sound the French national economy is during wartime. However, from the outside, Paris has disappeared into darkness, and it is impossible to find its form. Although France is celebrating the joyful festival, it is also considering the German air force's air raids. Therefore, the control of lights is still strictly enforced. The streets at night are completely dark, but as soon as you step inside a door, there are still brilliant lights, gentle heating, and abundant wine waiting for you to enjoy. Theater, music, and movies... are all performed in the dark. This year's Christmas in Paris, the appearance is indeed lacking in joy, but the interior is still so brilliant.

London Without Children

To welcome the Christmas holiday in the night with lights controlled must be something that had never happened even during the First World War! "Let us temporarily forget the war and spend Christmas as happily as usual." Unconsciously, this kind of emotion silently arose in the hearts of the British people. The streets are full of Christmas scenery. A part of the British soldiers on the western front had already hurriedly embarked on their journey home two days before Christmas, each returning to their longed-for hometown. Some sailors and airmen were also on leave. The department stores in London were as busy as last year, and entertainment venues such as theaters, restaurants, and nightclubs were still full. The railway authorities also increased the number of trains to facilitate travelers during the Christmas holidays. Christmas is the happiest day for children, but in London, 300,000 children have been dispersed to evacuation areas. In order to comfort the children returning to the evacuation areas, Santa Claus visited them earlier than in previous years. The children's parents took Christmas gifts on special trains to the evacuation areas and returned after spending an early Christmas with their children. The authorities told the children's parents: "No matter how much the children cry, you cannot bring them to London!" Therefore, it is impossible to find a child's shadow in London on Christmas.

Miscellaneous Thoughts

### The Right to Be Human

— Jia Yin

From the moment a small life is born, it should be considered a person. The right to be human can be said to be a gift from heaven. But unfortunately, this is not the case in reality. Because of the irrationality of the current social system, the unfortunate majority of people living in the world are constantly threatened by hunger and cold, oppressed by harsh environments, and abused by dark forces. In this deformed society, some people simply do not have the right to survive or receive fair and legitimate treatment. This is such a tragic thing.

Throughout history, many progressive thinkers have established the rights that people should enjoy. Now, Wells and others have summarized their opinions, added some new ideas, and drafted this "Declaration of Human Rights," which is worthy of our attention.

Humanity is moving towards an enlightened historical path. We hope and believe that one day, everyone will have the right to be human.

### Talking Points

— Shi Ding

According to a United Press report, ammunition worth $18.5 million is piled up at the docks of New York, ready to be shipped to Europe for the Allied countries. Amid the satisfied laughter of American arms dealers, we seem to hear the cries of European women.

Due to the severe cold, 67 child corpses were discovered in western Shanghai in one day. Poor little lives, you must be much happier now than when you were living in hunger and starvation.

The European situation is changing rapidly. German speculative merchants have invented a loose-leaf map to change borders at any time. They are truly ingenious and knowledgeable people.

Brazilian Consul General Vasconcelos of London said at a farewell banquet for the Brazilian Ambassador to Britain: "The need for international criminal law has never been greater than today. Aggressors should be directly responsible for brutal events, just as murderers should be held accountable. For the chief culprits who launch such great disasters, we have only one way to deal with them: to mobilize the power of the majority to drive out the aggressors; and to have the police of peace-loving countries intervene." If it can be done in reality, who would not agree?

### Old Stories of the Pear Garden

— Wu Gongshou

The senior Peking opera critic, Mr. Sun Yusheng (alias Haishang Shushisheng, deceased), once told me more than a dozen "Anecdotes of the Pear Garden," which were extremely valuable. Here are two excerpts:

(1) Private Costumes Started with Zhou and Li

When actors perform in a troupe, regardless of whether they are male, female, painted-face, or clown, all costumes are provided by the troupe. Therefore, the large costume box, the second costume box, the cheongsam box, and the weapon box are all fully prepared for the actors to use. Even top-notch actors do not have so-called private costumes. In the middle of the Guangxu period of the late Qing Dynasty, Zhou Fenglin opened the Dan Gui Tong Ji Teahouse on Daxin Street. Zhou was a famous female impersonator who wanted to show off her costumes in order to attract audiences. She specially made many costumes, but the costumes she purchased could be used by all the female impersonators in the troupe, not just for her personal use. She created the category of private costumes, the funds for which did not come from the public account but from her own pocket. As a result, others could only purchase their own. Thus, the female impersonator world started the practice of private costumes. Li Chunlai opened the Chun Xian Teahouse on Daxin Street and followed suit. The male martial roles also prepared their own. Gradually, actors playing the roles of old men, old women, and young men, whose salaries were between two and three hundred yuan, also made some costumes for the sake of looking good on stage. From then on, this practice became a habit, and the stage presented a splendid and colorful scene. However, the actors had an additional expense, and as the saying goes, the wool comes from the sheep, so the salaries increased more and more.

(2) Xiao Kuiguan Was Not a Graduate of a Formal Opera School

Among the roles in Peking opera, the painted-face role is the most difficult to find. It requires a loud voice, a tall physique, powerful movements, and skillful tumbling, and proficiency in weapons. Therefore, the painted-face roles in the Peking opera troupes are divided into copper hammer, frame, and martial clown. If there is one person who can combine these strengths in various plays, only Da Kuiguan stood out in the past, and thus enjoyed great fame. The successor, Xiao Kuiguan, was inferior in copper hammer and frame plays, but his tumbling was unmatched by ordinary actors. However, he was not a graduate of a formal opera school. It is said that he was originally a cobbler who set up a stall at the entrance of the Tianxian Teahouse on Shilu Road. He became acquainted with the people in the teahouse and would go into the teahouse to watch plays in his spare time. He was determined to learn and later became a disciple of Da Kuiguan, inheriting his skills. However, martial arts skills learned halfway through life are different from those learned from a young age. Therefore, whenever he performed the play "Baishuitan," playing Qing Erhu, he would inevitably break his elbows and bleed when he tumbled in his bare body. The next day, he would tumble again, and it would be the same. People asked him if he felt pain. He replied that he had been doing it for so long that he didn't feel it. Alas, how could he not feel pain! He wanted to perform well, so he had no choice but to do so.

Travels in the Arts

### Original Art

— Xiao Tian (1)

Confucius said, "Set your mind on the Way, hold to virtue, rely on benevolence, and roam in the arts." This is the method of Confucius teaching his disciples to improve their virtue and cultivate their studies, which shows the importance of art in human life. Even the sage did not neglect it. The Record of Learning says that the word "roam" has the meaning of not being hasty. I think this view is very correct. Not to mention engaging in artistic cultivation and learning, even watching a play or listening to music, if you do not have leisurely time and mood, you cannot appreciate the benefits of art.

It is a very strange thing that the world seems to have some prejudice against the terms "artist" and "performer." In fact, what is the difference between "special envoy" and "special person," for example? Usually, people in the acting world are called performers, but most performers are rarely able to reach the point of being skilled in their own art without exceeding the rules; if we want to talk about being proficient, that is really like a phoenix feather or unicorn horn. The reason is that they only know how a certain play should be performed, but they do not know why it should be performed in this way. They know what it is, but they do not know why it is. Therefore, they can still be listened to when they perform in accordance with the rules and follow the old patterns, but if they want to innovate and make arbitrary changes with a half-knowledge, it is simply terrifying. Perhaps it is because the term performer is too abused, so the emerging drama and film practitioners are called artists. Indeed, most artists have received considerable education, just like bank clerks and money shop employees. Although the occupations they engage in are similar, social perspectives inevitably have some distinctions.

In the past, Confucius, Mencius, and Xun Qing were called the Confucian school; Lao Tzu, Zhuangzi, and Liezi were called the Taoist school; Mozi's universal love was the Mo school; Yin Wenzi's rectification of names was the school of names; the Legalist school was initiated by Guan Zhong and completed by Han Fei; the military strategists first had Sun Wu and then Wu Qi; they could all express their own views, write books and establish theories, and point out the obvious behaviors based on the principle of why, which are all worthy of admiration by future generations. I say that those who can thoroughly understand the principles of art can be called artists. Artists are different from performers, they must have a smart mind, a spirit of tireless learning, broad collection of refined thoughts, he not only has to know how, but also to know why, must know why, to know whether this is right or not, wrong certainly to change, that is, originally good, because to accommodate certain conditions, so to change a method, the changed method, must also be in line with the principle of reason. In China, in modern times, I think we need artists very much.

Dedicated to the Erhu

### The Origin of Sun Zuochen's Four Erhus (Part Two)

— Su Shaoqing

In his later years in Shanghai, he was down on his luck, and this erhu was also silent. Later, Mr. Xue took it away. (Mr. Xue's name is Bin, the fourth son of Xue Baorun, a wealthy merchant from Wuxi). The New Bamboo erhu was purchased by Sun in Beijing in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China for thirteen yuan. It is a new product, so it can be called New Bamboo. It is said that it is also in the hands of Mr. Xue; the Thin Crane erhu is thin and long, and its sound is like a crane's cry. The pegs have been worn thin due to the passage of time and are about to break. Now it is in the possession of my friend Mr. Qian, who was given it by Sun out of gratitude for his kindness; I often visited his residence, took it off the wall, and played a tune, its sound was clear and melodious, equal to my Sun's Phoenix erhu; my Phoenix erhu was sent by Sun's son at his request at the time of his death, as detailed in my essay "Record of Obtaining the Erhu," which was published in this newspaper, so I won't repeat it here. Why is this erhu called Phoenix? Because the bamboo of its entire body is red-purple, and its sound is yang, "Phoenix facing the sun," this erhu resembles it, the rod is thick and the tube is small and flat, different from ordinary erhus. When Sun was alive, whenever he played this erhu, it was like ten thousand horses galloping, like a sudden storm, or like the rising sun, its blazing light illuminating the universe, so it was named Phoenix. Some say it was the erhu of his teacher Jia Sanming Lichun, about eighty years old. Unfortunately, my hand is not strong and my skill is not high, although it is stored in my study, it is like casting a bright pearl in the dark. However, if I encounter a generous and unrestrained song, the sad state of this erhu's sound is like a snow-filled night in a wine shop, and meeting a swordsman, its cheerfulness is indeed gratifying. I wrote this while drunk, and I miss Mr. Sun even more. I will ask a master craftsman to engrave "Sun's Phoenix Erhu" on it to commemorate him, and to let those who obtain this erhu after a hundred years know its value. Recorded on New Year's Day of the twenty-ninth year of the Republic of China.
