### Japanese Troops in Nanning Heavily Defeated by Chinese Army, Most Retreating to the Qin-Fang Area; Japanese Aircraft and Gasoline at Nanning Airfield Burned; Chinese Army in Hubei Recovers Pingba, Encircles Sanyangdian

Guinan Frontline Telegram: Japanese troops fleeing south from Nanning were intercepted and attacked by the Chinese army along the way, appearing extremely disheveled. Most of the Japanese troops have now retreated to the Qin-Fang area. A strong Chinese force is currently pursuing them south. (19th Telegram)

Binyang: Remnants of the Japanese army in Yong are still holed up in fortifications near Santang, attempting to hold out to the death. However, within Nanning city, the Japanese are still fighting among themselves, with gunfire and explosions incessant. The fires are still raging, causing many casualties. The Japanese troop garrison in Xixiangtang, outside the city, has also been completely burned. On the 15th, the Chinese army burned all the Japanese aircraft and gasoline at the Nanning airfield. (19th Telegram)

Guinan Frontline: The Japanese army in Nanning city has been in a state of extreme chaos since the 15th. The large fire has not been extinguished for three days and nights. The remaining Japanese are fleeing southward in disarray. (19th Telegram)

Guilin: In early February, after fierce fighting in Guinan, more than 2,000 severely wounded Japanese soldiers were transported to the Qinxian reception center, but they all died completely on the 16th, 17th, and 18th, appearing to have been poisoned. Also, after the Fengxi campaign in early January, the Japanese officers and soldiers who were severely wounded and left in Chao-Shan for treatment have all died. (19th Telegram)

Chongqing: According to news from here today, there are considerable differences of opinion among the Japanese commanders in Nanning regarding the withdrawal issue. Ever since the 15th, the Japanese commander in Nanning has been demanding a prior withdrawal, to escape back to Qinzhou, their original landing point. (19th Associated Press Telegram)

Chongqing: Although there are widespread rumors that the Japanese army is currently withdrawing from Nanning, well-informed Chinese sources do not believe this to be the case. In their opinion, the Japanese army may still put up a stubborn resistance before abandoning the city. When the Japanese army retreats towards Nanning, it is expected that major fires will break out in villages northeast of the city. This is because the Japanese army also looted and burned when they invaded Binyang and Wuming earlier this month. Many places in Binyang and the entire city of Wuming have been burned to the ground. During the Japanese occupation of Binyang and Wuming, the Chinese residents who remained in the two cities suffered from a shortage of food and supplies. The Japanese army did not carry much food when they advanced north from Nanning, so when their rear supply lines were cut off by the Chinese army, food became extremely scarce. The large fire in Nanning city may have been caused by looting by the Japanese troops retreating from Binyang and Wuming to obtain food. Regarding the reported complete withdrawal of the Japanese army from Nanning to Qinzhou along the coast, the Japanese originally concentrated a large force to invade Binyang and Wuming, but the offensive failed. The entire army retreated to Nanning. However, Nanning is a small city that cannot accommodate such a large force, nor does it need such a large force for defense. Therefore, the Japanese commander may have ordered the surplus troops to retreat to the coast for rest and reorganization. For example, in a large city like Nanjing, 50,000 Chinese troops were stationed for defense two years ago, and the city already felt overcrowded. Therefore, it is natural for the Japanese commander to withdraw troops from Nanning now. (19th Reuters Telegram)

### The Military Significance of the Great Victory in Guinan

Today, the center of gravity of the Sino-Japanese war is still in Guinan. Guinan is where Japan is devoting all its efforts, and Guinan is also where China is defending with heavy troops. Other actions, such as Japan's sneak crossing of the Qiantang River to probe Xiaoshan, the Japanese army's advance from Wuyuan to attack Linhe, and even the smaller incursions, such as using bandits and puppets to probe Dongshan from the Fujian coast and landing on the Shandong Peninsula to probe Wendeng, are all abandoning the center to spy on the periphery. Their purpose is nothing more than to conceal their military setbacks, divert attention at home, and constrain Chinese forces, so that they can use concentrated forces to attack their main target. Success in the above-mentioned offensives would not affect the overall situation, while failure would result in many losses. Advancing rashly with a small number of troops, hoping for a fluke victory, is a situation whose failure can be predicted without divination. As expected, the Japanese army probing eastern Zhejiang is stuck on the Xiaoshan line without making any progress, and the Japanese army probing Linhe has now retreated to Wuyuan and is likely to continue retreating to Baotou. Other sporadic small-scale disturbances by bandits and puppets are easily defeated by the Chinese army, which is what was expected. These actions do not play a decisive role in the overall war situation and are not where both sides concentrate their forces to fight.

Since the Japanese army succeeded in capturing Guinan, the Chinese army has counterattacked Nanning, and the main forces of both sides have begun to engage in a major battle. In mid-November of last year, the Japanese army landed from Qin-Fang, crossed the Shiwan Mountains, invaded Guangxi, and captured Nanning. The Japanese army gained an important stronghold. How to consolidate the periphery of Nanning for long-term occupation naturally became the important task of the Japanese army at that time. Therefore, after the Japanese army captured Nanning, they divided their troops into two routes, advancing along the Yong-Bin and Yong-Wu routes. Although the Japanese army's goal was not only to occupy Kunlun Pass, relying on its strategic position to defend, but also to try to advance from Binyang to Liuzhou and Guilin, remotely echoing the Japanese army in northern Guangdong, and to advance from Nanning to Yongchun, Guixian, and Yulin, so as to open up the Xijiang route and join forces with the already present army in Xijiang, so that western Guangdong and western Guangxi could be connected, and the transport of military supplies and provisions could proceed smoothly, without relying solely on the Yong-Qin highway, which was often threatened by Chinese guerrilla teams, as the main transportation route. And the Japanese army could also continuously enter Guinan to confront the main force of the Chinese army, waiting for the opportunity to defeat the Chinese army, and achieve a quick victory. However, they could not live up to what was in their hearts. The Yong-Qin highway, because it had been thoroughly destroyed by the Chinese, even though the Japanese army had accelerated repairs and armed convoys, had not been able to quickly achieve the goal of consolidating the periphery of Nanning, and the Kunlun Pass, which they had once occupied, had also been recaptured by the Chinese. After the Kunlun Pass debacle, the Japanese army greatly reinforced their forces in early February, claiming to have 40,000 men, but in reality, it was probably more than that number (the Chinese estimated it to be as many as 100,000). One route detoured through the Yongchun plain area, directly attacking Binyang, and at one point even infiltrated Shanglin, northwest of Binyang. Another route approached the suburbs of Wuming. The Chinese army advanced with a large force to the rear of the Japanese army, cutting off the Japanese communication routes. The Japanese army then collapsed completely and fled in disarray. In this battle, the Japanese army was annihilated by the Chinese army, reaching over 20,000 men. The Chinese army has now advanced to the city of Nanning. Although the Japanese army in the city is putting up a desperate fight, it is difficult to hold out for long.

Of course, Nanning under Japanese occupation, as its base for attacking the southwest, is of great military importance. It will inevitably defend it to the death and will not give up easily. But in the era where the Chinese overall counteroffensive has not yet arrived, at the cost of sacrifice, attacking a dead city does not have any major significance. However, due to the failure of the Japanese army's easy advance into Binyang and Wuming, first of all, at least it makes people feel that the Japanese army's plan to open up Hunan and Guangxi and head for Kunming and Chongqing is completely a dream. Secondly, we should know that the Japanese invasion of Guinan is not purely for military purposes, but the political and diplomatic roles are even more important than the military role. Japan knows very well that using the strength of four divisions for military uphill attacks and passing through the mountainous areas of Guangxi and Yunnan to achieve the purpose of annihilating the main force of the Chinese army is tantamount to seeking fish from a tree, which cannot be fulfilled. However, the Japanese army still dared to take a risk in Guinan in the hope of promoting "China's consideration of peace." This has been affirmatively answered in Chairman Chiang's re-emphasizing of the war of resistance speech, proving that Japan's conspiracy has failed again. Thirdly, after the battle in Guinan, the Japanese army妄想to "annihilate" the Chinese army after resting. They felt that the Chinese army "has the possibility of being annihilated," and then felt that they had no chance to have a main battle with the Chinese army and regretting it. So, this decisive war met an unprecedented encounter battle and were deeply pleased, but the Japanese army's ideal annihilation battle, the attempt to eliminate the strength of the Chinese army, is also completely an illusion, proven by the fact that the Japanese army died more than one division.

Now that the Japanese army's attempt to invade Binyang and Wuming has failed, the Daming Mountains (Kunlun Pass area) are under the control of the Chinese army, and the two plains areas that are most convenient for the Japanese army to advance with heavy weapons and mechanized units are the western Xianglong Prefecture and the eastern Xiangyong Prefecture plains. And opening up the Xijiang line is indeed the Japanese people's ideal plan. The day when the Japanese army detoured Yongchun to invade Binyang had already revealed its clues. If the Chinese side controls this throat, then the Japanese army will not be able to compete with the Chinese army for geographical advantage to the north, nor will they be able to compete with the Chinese army for transportation lines to the south; then, even if they hold Nanning, they will inevitably sit and wait for death.

The great defeat in northern Hunan, the frustration in northern Hubei, and the collapse in this Guinan are all mistakes caused by easy advance and easy retreat, violating major military taboos. The Japanese generals have repeatedly followed the same disastrous path, not entirely due to their 顢預, the main reason is that the teachers are old and outside, the people are resentful inside, the parliament and the government are not in harmony, and the government and the military department are at odds. This situation is very dangerous. So the Japanese commander遂饥不择食, 渴不择饮, and does not hesitate to take risks in order to expedite the return. This can be proven by the notification issued by the South China Japanese Army Headquarters by radio to the generals of the Guinan Chinese Army forward, advising the Chinese army to abandon the offensive and pursue peace after this decisive battle defeat.

### Pittman Advocates Taking Retaliatory Measures Against Japan, Saying This Is a Legitimate Move to Protect Rights and Will Not Cause the Other Country to Declare War on the United States

Washington: At yesterday's meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Chairman Pittman delivered a speech, stating that the United States can take retaliatory measures against any country that does not respect American rights without causing war. For example, regarding the disputes between the Japanese army stationed in China and American expatriates, the United States, in addition to protesting empty-handedly, must take further action. I believe that if the reason for the American protest is legitimate, then the American government's actions to protect national rights by retaliatory measures must also be legitimate and legal. This is beyond doubt. Some say that other countries may declare war on our country because of this. The US government really does not need to be concerned about such far-fetched and distant possibilities. I firmly believe that no rational government will declare war on the United States, because any country that declares war on the United States will become a belligerent in the eyes of the United States and will have to accept various consequences. In short, the United States may have the possibility of taking retaliatory measures, but it is absolutely not necessary to send a single soldier to Europe or Asia, which is what we can rest assured of, he said. Senator Ashurst of Arizona then spoke, also supporting the implementation of an embargo against Japan. (19th Havas Telegram)

Washington: Last night, various important senators and congressmen in the United States expressed their opinions on economic sanctions in a radio broadcast here, engaging in a debate. Chairman Pittman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has always been a champion of economic sanctions against Japan. Last night, in a radio broadcast, he stated that the United States has the legal right to take retaliatory measures against Japan in order to safeguard its rights and interests in China. Therefore, when talking about the issue of export embargoes against Japan, Pittman declared, "If the United States really wants to safeguard its rights and interests in China, it must take further action than protests." When talking about the issue of Japan waging war against the United States, Pittman said, "As of now, unless the country has gone mad, it will never declare war on the United States." Democratic Senator Hugh Wilson vigorously supported Pittman's proposal. Wilson stated that Japan would have difficulty carrying out its invasion of China without material assistance from the United States. Unfortunately, since Japan waged war against China, it has always sought its own interests, and therefore the war against China has been protracted. If American assistance were withdrawn, the Japanese war of aggression against China might have collapsed long ago. Congressman Tinkham of the House Foreign Affairs Committee believes that there is a tacit understanding between Britain and the United States to deal with Japan. This tacit understanding is based on the 1938 British-American joint management agreement of Canton Island and Enderbury Island in the South Pacific, because he asked Secretary of State Hull last year to announce the content of this tacit understanding, but Hull declined to do so before obtaining British consent, stating that he could not announce it. It can be seen that there is indeed a tacit understanding. As for the United States' abrogation of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, it is nothing more than the first step in introducing war. Republican Senator Gerald Nye said, "Speaking of the export embargo, I think the facts may not be beneficial to China, but it will inevitably arouse Japan's ill will." (19th Associated Press Telegram)

Washington: According to news heard here today, the Republican National Convention today approved the government's oppressive policies in the Far East. As for President Roosevelt's other foreign policies, the Republican National Convention also approved them, but some isolationists still warned the government not to allow the United States to be involved in the vortex of war with Japan. According to some government leaders, the House of Representatives' rejection of the bill to fortify Guam has weakened the possibility of the United States reaching an understanding with Japan.

### Japan Eager to Restore Treaty Relations with the United States; Deep Anxiety in Japan Regarding the Current Situation; Negotiations of Japan-Soviet Commercial Treaty in Progress; Spokesperson of the Japanese Foreign Ministry Answers Questions from Foreign Reporters

Hong Kong, Tokyo dispatch: A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, in response to questions from foreign reporters, stated that future developments in Japan-U.S. relations depend entirely on the attitude of the United States. Japan has exhausted every possible means to improve the current situation, and we have made the final friendly and concrete gestures. However, it is regrettable that the United States has not responded, resulting in the current state of deadlock between the two countries. When reporters inquired about the increasingly tough tone of Japanese press commentary on the United States, the spokesperson asked them not to overemphasize newspaper reports, but acknowledged that public sentiment in Japan is averse to the United States. The spokesperson stated that the strengthening of this sentiment in the Japanese press stems from the existence of a deadlock between the two countries. Recent U.S. measures such as the embargo against Japan, the fortification of Guam, and the granting of new loans to China have all attracted Japanese attention and increased Japanese animosity. However, the Japanese government still hopes to restore treaty relations with the two countries, and this policy remains unchanged. The goal is to promote friendly and good neighborly relations with the United States, which Japan considers of utmost importance. When reporters asked whether the U.S. Congress delaying discussions on the embargo against Japan could clear up the current deadlock between the two countries, the spokesperson said that even if the U.S. Congress delays discussions, Japan would still feel apprehensive. When reporters inquired about the rumored issue of France not allowing Japanese aircraft to fly over Annam to Thailand, the spokesperson stated that this was indeed the case. However, Japan-Thailand relations are very close and should not be disrupted by France's opposition. Therefore, the Japanese government is currently working with the Thai government to study technical issues so that aircraft can fly directly to Thailand. When reporters asked whether countries had lodged new protests or engaged in negotiations regarding Japanese aircraft bombing the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the spokesperson stated that the Japanese government is still considering the legal issues of the U.S.'s earlier protest and has not yet submitted a response. (Dispatch of the 19th)

Tokyo: A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, when meeting with reporters today, stated that the negotiations for a commercial treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan are currently progressing smoothly. When asked whether the treaty would be largely the same as the Soviet-German commercial treaty, the spokesperson replied that trade conditions differ, but the Soviet-Japan commercial treaty may resemble the Soviet-German commercial treaty in some respects. Regarding relations with the United States, the spokesperson said that Japan's attitude towards the United States is gradually becoming stronger due to the lack of commercial treaties and the threat of embargoes. Japan has done everything it could, and these efforts have not been rewarded, which is regrettable. Regarding the incident of the British Navy boarding the German ship Altmark in Norwegian territorial waters, Japan currently has no reaction. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)

### Opening of the Yangtze River Still Far Off

Tokyo: On December 18th of last year, Foreign Minister Nomura of the Abe Cabinet solemnly declared to the U.S. Ambassador to Japan that the Yangtze River would be opened within a month. The deadline of February has now passed, and the opening of the Yangtze River is still far off. Today, in the House of Representatives Budget Committee, Representative Koyama raised this issue, but the Japanese government has not been able to determine a date. Representative Koyama asked whether the opening of the Yangtze River would cause economic damage to Japan. Army Minister Hata Shunroku replied that the date of the opening of the Yangtze River must be determined by the military based on military considerations, and not based on the economic impact on Japan. However, Hata Shunroku did not specify when the river would be opened. (Associated Press dispatch of the 19th)

### Japan-Thailand Aviation Test Flight Scheduled for the 26th

Tokyo: The test flight for direct aviation between Japan and Thailand is scheduled to take place on the 26th of this month. This aviation route will not pass over French Annam, but will bypass the peninsula's beaches, and will fly directly to Bangkok from Guangzhou, completing a continuous oversea flight. The regular Japan-Thailand aviation route, which was concluded last December, was originally scheduled to commence at the beginning of this month, but due to the authorities in Annam not allowing landings in Hanoi, this initial oversea flight plan for Japan had to be established. The aircraft to be used will be Mitsubishi's twin-engine transport aircraft, "Tachikaze." The crew will consist of Captain Matsue Katsugo, pilot Migita Kiyoshi, engineers Nagaoka Tsutomu and Ito Magoshichi, communications officer Asada Masakiyo, and Sato Nobusada, six people in total. It is scheduled to depart from Haneda Airport at 6:30 AM on the 26th for the test flight, and is expected to arrive in Bangkok at 5:00 PM on the 28th. Two of these test flights will be held in March, and the regular flight will be officially launched around April. (Domei News Agency dispatch of the 19th)

### Yunnan Army Continues to Leave Yunnan to Participate in the War

Chongqing: Tonight, rumors here that negotiations are underway to disarm a certain area of the Yunnan-Vietnam border were dismissed as absurd and laughable. A spokesperson for the French Embassy told reporters, "This statement is a joke, utterly absurd, and not worth denying." Reporters inquired with Chinese sources, who also strongly denied it. It is said that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Yunnan Army has been fighting on various lines in Central and Southern China. Now, the Yunnan Army continues to leave Yunnan in batches to participate in the war. Furthermore, it is well known that Yunnan has a branch of the Central Aviation School and the Central Military Academy, in addition to other military facilities. Recently, anti-aircraft guns have been transferred to Yunnan to protect the Yunnan Railway. Since these anti-aircraft guns arrived, Japanese aircraft attacking the railway have encountered fierce artillery fire. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)

### Soviet Army Has Reached the West Coast of the Gulf of Finland; Railway Hub of Viipuri in Danger; Finland Claims Victory Northeast of Lake Ladoga

Moscow: According to a communique from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, on the 18th, our army's offensive in the Karelian sector continued to develop successfully. Under the pressure of our army, the enemy continued to retreat, and our army advanced to the line of the Tairmonkatay River (between Lake Voksijärvi and Lake Juoksemajärvi), and occupied the Mara fortress area and town, the Summa station on the coastal railway (ten kilometers south of Viipuri), the town of Jänhannes, and the Mäkisaaraati station on the coastal railway. Thus, Soviet troops have reached the coastal area west of the Gulf of Finland north of Koivisto Island. In the two days of the 17th and 18th, our army captured 313 fortifications, including 41 artillery positions. From February 11th to the 18th, our army captured a total of 475 fortifications, including 92 fortified artillery positions. As for other aspects, there were no important developments. The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy troops and enemy military targets, and shot down 21 enemy aircraft in air combat. (TASS dispatch of the 19th)

Helsinki: A communique was released here stating that the pressure exerted by the Soviet army in Karelia has gradually weakened between the Gulf of Finland and Voksa. Yesterday there were minor local battles on the front line, and there was considerable activity in the air, but otherwise it was calm. Several Soviet tanks were destroyed. Artillery activity was normal in the Suvanto area and Taipale district. Finnish troops on the northeast coast and Lake Ladoga repelled the attacking Soviet army and captured several strong Soviet positions, capturing eight Soviet cannons, three tanks, and destroying eighty Soviet transport vehicles. 570 Soviet soldiers were left dead. There was a small battle in the Kumo area, with 130 Soviet soldiers killed. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)

Helsinki: Concerns about the Soviet army capturing Viipuri increased again last night. According to unconfirmed reports, the Soviet army is only eight kilometers away from Viipuri. Viipuri is a key military point, with a population of 85,000 in peacetime. As a result of the forced evacuation after the outbreak of the war, only 10,000 people remain. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 19th)

Helsinki: Military figures here believe that the situation in Karelia is extremely serious, but not hopeless. The Soviet army has repeatedly attacked Finnish positions, and the Finnish army has resisted stubbornly. According to military figures, the Mannerheim Line has a feature of great military value: at any time, if forced to retreat due to excessive Soviet pressure, it will not allow important positions to fall into the hands of the Russian army. Although the Finnish army has now moved to a new line of defense, it is still making every effort to prevent the concentration of Soviet troops. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 19th)

Helsinki: The General Headquarters recently announced that since the first of this month, at least 160 Soviet aircraft have been shot down by our side. If calculated from the date of the start of the war, 412 enemy aircraft have been shot down. In addition, government authorities recently issued a notice stating that all those who were temporarily exempted from military service due to poor health in the past must now enlist in the army. (Havas dispatch of the 19th)

Capital of Switzerland: In the past two days, the Red Army's attack on the second Finnish line of defense has not achieved success. The Finnish fighter squadrons engaged the Soviet Air Force for the first time yesterday, resulting in as many as 24 Soviet aircraft being shot down. In addition, after the Finnish army surrounded the Red Army in the Bigaranger area, it was resolved and 32 cannons were captured. (Havas dispatch of the 19th)

Capital of Sweden: News received here states that the Red Army suffered 4,000 casualties in Karelia in the past three days. The Finnish army retreated to the new position in good order. This new position is much stronger than the one that was abandoned. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)

Capital of Sweden: According to news received here, the Soviet offensive in Karelia has temporarily stopped, and the Finnish army has gained a chance to breathe. The Finnish side is showing great disappointment with Sweden's refusal of direct military assistance. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)

Helsinki: The General Headquarters recently released a communique stating that the Finnish army won a great victory in the northeast of Lake Ladoga.

### Germany Threatens Norway and Sweden Not to Directly Aid Finland; Attempts to Mediate the Soviet-Finnish War; Finland and the Soviet Union Insist on Their Respective Positions

Paris: News from responsible sources in Paris last night stated that Germany has formally notified Norway and Sweden that if the two countries provide Finland with any direct assistance, Germany will consider the two countries to have violated their neutrality. It is generally believed that this is the reason why Sweden refused Finland's request and would not provide military assistance. This attitude of Germany proves that any country that assists a neighboring country attacked by the Soviet Union must not only deal with the Soviet Union, but must also deal with Germany. However, newspaper opinions believe that Germany may not dare to implement this threat, as it would create another war front, which would be detrimental to Germany. Newspapers generally stated that the issue of saving Finland must be resolved by the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)

Paris: Well-informed sources said that the reason why the Swedish government refused to provide military assistance to Finland was due to Germany's attitude. According to various sources, rumors that Germany intends to mediate between Finland and the Soviet Union are still rampant. Generally, Germany hopes that after Sweden refuses military assistance, the Finnish army's will to fight can be dissipated, so that the Finnish government can more easily accept a compromise solution. But in reality, any compromise solution that does not recognize Finland's political independence is unlikely to be considered by the Finnish government. At the same time, the Soviet government is also unwilling to abandon the puppet government it created in Finland, namely the so-called "Finnish People's Government," at this time. In this situation, Germany's hope of mediating between Finland and the Soviet Union has almost completely disappeared. (Havas dispatch of the 18th)

London: An official communique was read out on German radio today, stating that Germany is no longer bound by the London Submarine Treaty.

Swedes who learned of the contents of the above letter were deeply surprised. (Haitong dispatch of the 19th)

### British Gunboat Brazen Sunk by German Torpedo; Over 100 Officers and Men Missing; Had Been Stationed in Chinese Waters Before the War

London: According to the British Admiralty today, the British gunboat Brazen, formerly stationed in Chinese waters, has been sunk by a torpedo.

Their relatives have now been notified separately. The Brazen was built in 1932 and was equipped with four 4.7-inch guns and one 3-inch gun. The ship and the destroyer Duchess, which was sunk in a collision last December, are sister ships. Both ships served in the China Fleet at the same time and were blockaded by the Japanese Navy in Fuzhou last June. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)

London: Regarding the sinking of the British destroyer Brazen, the Admiralty recently released a communique stating that the Brazen has indeed sunk, and only one officer and four sailors have been rescued.

### Britain Demands Norwegian Government Detain German Auxiliary Ship; Accuses Norway of Failing to Fulfill Responsibilities of Neutral Country; Norway Will Submit the Case to the League of Nations for Discussion

London: British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax met with the Norwegian envoy last night and resolutely demanded that Norway detain the German merchant ship Altmark. Britain raised the request because Norway had not fulfilled its responsibilities as a neutral party by holding the Altmark in Bergen and not releasing the 300 British prisoners carried by the German ship. (Associated Press dispatch of the 19th)

London: Regarding the case of the German auxiliary ship Altmark, Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Norwegian envoy Kerdy today and lodged a protest with him. The Foreign Office released a communique in the afternoon stating: "In view of the manner in which the Norwegian authorities treated the Altmark when it was staying in Norwegian territorial waters, the British government believes that it has not fulfilled the responsibilities of a neutral country, and therefore submits the following views to the Norwegian government: It is well known that the Altmark was in the position of an auxiliary ship when the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee was engaged in various illegal activities. The British government has also received reliable reports that the Altmark is holding 300 to 400 British subjects, and is also aware that the ship is equipped with offensive weapons. The Norwegian government should have known about the ship's passage, and therefore should have strictly inspected it when it arrived at the port of Bergen and requested to pass through Norwegian territorial waters. The British government is eager to know the course and results of this inspection procedure. According to reports we have received, the Norwegian authorities' conduct of this procedure appears to be purely perfunctory, and therefore not a single British prisoner held on the ship was discovered. To the best of the British government's knowledge, the Norwegian government's actions have violated the obligations of a neutral country. If the Norwegian authorities had discovered these British prisoners at that time, they would have either released them or detained them pending careful consideration of how to deal with them. If so, these more than 300 British prisoners would at least not have been taken to German detention camps. Therefore, the British government has sufficient rights to express dissatisfaction with the Norwegian government's inaction, as the Norwegian government will be responsible if these prisoners are not discovered in time and are sent to Germany and mistreated. Furthermore, while awaiting a response from the Norwegian government, the British government firmly believes that it has sufficient reason to demand that the Norwegian government detain the German ship Altmark." (Havas dispatch of the 18th)

London: Londoners are surprised by the German claim that the Altmark is an unarmed merchant ship, as the Lloyd's Register of Shipping does not list any merchant ship named Altmark. Furthermore, according to the list of coastal radio stations published by the International Telegraph and Radio Union of the City of Bern, Switzerland, in June 1939, the German ship named Altmark is clearly a warship. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)

Geneva: Representatives of the Scandinavian countries to the League of Nations stated that the Norwegian government will submit the Altmark incident to the League of Nations for discussion, but believe that this can only produce moral results. According to the Norwegian representative, "Norway will not abandon its efforts regarding this matter until London accepts the Norwegian protest, and will join Sweden and Denmark to at least prevent the recurrence of this incident. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 19th)

### Truth Newspaper Commentary: German-Soviet Economic Agreement - Further Development of German-Soviet Friendship Conforms to the Peace and Interests of All Nations

Moscow - The Truth Newspaper recently published a commentary discussing the German-Soviet economic agreement, titled "The German-Soviet Agreement Benefits Both Countries." The newspaper stated, "On September 28, 1939, when the German-Soviet Friendship and Border Treaty was signed, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov and the German Foreign Minister exchanged documents expressing their willingness to draft a plan for exchanging German and Soviet goods. The German-Soviet economic agreement signed on February 11 this year fully conforms to the aforementioned wishes. The agreement stipulates that the Soviet Union will transport raw materials to Germany in exchange for German industrial products, which is extremely beneficial to both parties. The German-Soviet economic agreement is an important development of the various agreements concluded between Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939. This agreement fully conforms to the spirit of friendship in the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact concluded in August 1939. The trade and credit agreement signed in Berlin on August 19 was indeed an important step in promoting political and economic relations between the two countries. The purpose of signing the trade agreement at that time was to eliminate the tense political atmosphere. The agreement has achieved great success in this regard. However, because the total trade volume stipulated in the agreement failed to fully advance the friendly relations between the two countries, an economic agreement was signed on February 11 to supplement the shortcomings of the agreement. Soviet Premier Molotov said at the Fifth Extraordinary Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, 'Since the Soviet Union and Germany concluded the Non-Aggression Pact on August 23, the abnormal relations between the two countries for many years have ended. Both sides have eliminated old grievances and further established friendly relations. On September 28, the two sides established a friendly border agreement, and the friendly relations between the two sides became even closer. The Soviet people are convinced that the improvement of Soviet-German relations and the development of friendly relations between the two major nations are extremely important and will have a positive impact on the international situation. The facts of the past few months have proved this belief. What is important is that the development of German-Soviet friendship fully conforms to the peace and interests of all countries. Today, Germany has become a highly developed industrial country with great mechanical and chemical industries. However, German industry still has a great need for raw materials. The Soviet Union can indeed supply Germany with a large amount of raw materials. The richness of raw materials that we can export is no less than that of German industrial products. The Soviet Union has become a great industrial country. The strength of our industry and mechanized agriculture is not only recognized by Soviet friends, but also recognized by those who hate the Soviet Union. However, because the scope of socialist construction stipulated in the Soviet Union's Third Five-Year Plan is extremely broad, and because industry will be further developed in the future five-year plan, the Soviet Union still has a great need for industrial products. The implementation of the Soviet economic plan aims to surpass any capitalist country in economic terms. Therefore, the Soviet Union has a large need for industrial products (i.e., those manufactured in Germany). We must further develop Soviet industry and at the same time consolidate our national defense capabilities. The German-Soviet economic agreement will expand the Soviet Union's foreign trade. We should pay attention to the sharp reduction in our trade with Britain and France. Even before the outbreak of the war, Britain and France canceled Soviet orders. This behavior is also extremely detrimental to themselves. It is strange that the Soviet Union ships goods to Britain and France, but the latter refuses to exchange goods. In addition, the Paris police searched the Soviet trade agencies in a manner similar to that of bandits. This behavior is reminiscent of Jensen Hicks' search of the Soviet trade agencies in London in 1927 and eliminates all possibilities for expanding Soviet-French trade. The Soviet Union has highly developed industries and agriculture, and its economic strength is extremely great. It does not need to rely on foreign countries. The development of its trade will not be slightly stalled by the obstruction of Britain and France. The economic agreement signed on February 11 shows the possibility of developing German-Soviet trade. Currently, Germany and the Soviet Union both have a strong desire to develop trade. After the German-Soviet agreement is signed, the total trade volume between the two countries in the first year of implementation will exceed any figure since the World War, and will continue to increase in the future. This agreement is extremely important for the economies of the two major powers, Germany and the Soviet Union. In addition, it will affect international economic life and is also extremely important politically. After the German-Soviet economic agreement was concluded, newspapers in Britain, the United States, and various European countries commented on it. German newspapers of course expressed satisfaction with the agreement. Other newspapers also wrote articles unanimously, believing that this new agreement is extremely important for consolidating Soviet-German economic cooperation. In the past few months, various agreements concluded between Germany and the Soviet Union (including the Non-Aggression Pact, the Friendship and Border Treaty, and the economic agreement) have created a solid foundation for the development of economic and political relations between the two countries. The agreement is extremely in line with the interests of the German and Soviet peoples, the interests of peace, and the interests of the masses worldwide. (Tass dispatch from the 18th)

### Japanese Minister of Colonial Affairs Plans to Expand in the South Seas - Ministry of Foreign Affairs Decides to Add a South Seas Bureau

Tokyo - Koiso, the Minister of Colonial Affairs, is known as the most resolute figure in the Yonai Cabinet. Recently, he drafted a plan to concentrate on economically expanding influence in the South Pacific. He is now working diligently to implement it step by step, so that the "South Seas Expansion Plan" will definitely receive an important impetus in the short term. The following matters can serve as evidence: (1) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to add a South Seas Bureau. (2) The Colonial Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs has added a South Seas Section. (3) Last summer, Japan and the Pacific mandated islands (i.e., the Caroline Islands, the Mariana Islands, and the Marshall Islands) decided to open an air route. (4) The convenience of South Seas shipping will be improved. (5) A South Seas Shrine will be built on Palau Island (located southwest of the Philippine Islands) to enshrine the sun god. (6) A Tokyo Municipal Trade Bureau will be established in Batavia, Java, to develop commercial relations with the Dutch East Indies. (7) Minister of Colonial Affairs Koiso inspected the Pacific mandated islands last month. (8) Minister of Colonial Affairs Koiso recently published a speech in various newspapers, strongly stating that the East Asian economic group should include the South Seas. (9) When the House of Representatives recently met, the majority of the members advocated expanding economic influence in the South Seas, and Foreign Minister Arita gave a favorable reply. In addition to this, there are various signs that cannot be listed in detail. What is particularly noteworthy is that the expansion of influence only refers to economic influence, not political influence. Japanese officials have repeatedly issued declarations, stating that they have no territorial ambitions and no intention of aggression. What they seek is to find new markets and new sources of raw materials in the South Pacific. As for why Japan is expanding its economic influence in the South Seas, the Pacific Affairs Research Department of the Japan International Association recently issued a statement to explain it. The content roughly stated that the Pacific Islands "should be placed under the shining light of modern culture," and the treasures of these islands should be made public. If the policy now implemented by Japan is only carried out in the Asian continent and its success is sought, it is impossible. The Pacific Ocean has a variety of resources, and its location is quite convenient, enough to assist in the success of Japanese policies. In short, good opportunities are "once in a thousand years." The Japanese people must fully utilize them. This responsibility is extremely important. (Havas dispatch from the 18th)

Not only that, the President's trip was in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army and Navy, first inspecting the Panama Canal Zone, in order to show that in his view, the U.S. should consider the area as the most important defense line against enemies from the Atlantic or Pacific.

### U.S. Republican Party - Campaign Platform

Washington - The Republican National Executive Committee recently issued a campaign platform for the general election. In terms of foreign policy, it is roughly the same as the current government's policy, that is, it advocates strict neutrality and will never participate in the European war. The government should reiterate that various treaties have a sacred and inviolable nature, as well as the U.S. government's willingness to respect international law and maintain order. In terms of national defense, it advocates implementing a national defense plan that includes the entire Western Hemisphere. In terms of domestic affairs, it declares that the current government's "New Deal" has completely failed economically, opposes government control of private enterprises, and advocates (1) implementing a separation of powers in administration, (2) reducing all federal government expenditures by 20%, (3) restoring budget equilibrium, (4) restoring the gold standard, (5) abolishing the President's powers over the currency system, (6) reducing income tax and business tax, (7) revising current commercial and agricultural policies, and (8) various current laws governing labor-management relations should be revised.

### U.S. Note to Southern Ireland - Submits Volunteer for Peace Movement - Apparently Recognizes Ireland as a Neutral Country

Dublin - After U.S. Secretary of State Hull announced that he would hold talks with the envoys of various neutral countries in Europe to the United States, the government of the Southern Ireland Commonwealth received a note from the U.S. government, proposing this matter. Government officials believe that what U.S. President Roosevelt is working on is to find various foundations to pave the way for future peace negotiations. This is most satisfactory. As for the content of the reply to be submitted by the Republican government, officials have not yet revealed anything. According to well-informed sources, the cabinet of the Republican government has reached a consensus that it can fully agree with President Roosevelt's initiative. Chairman of the Executive Council de Valera often personally telegraphed President Roosevelt to respond. In addition, the U.S. government previously caused displeasure here when it included Ireland in the "European War Zone," but the U.S. government's decision to slightly consult the Southern Ireland Republican government shows that it has indeed recognized Ireland as a neutral country. (Havas dispatch from the 19th)

### Large-Scale Arrests of Terrorists in Ireland - de Valera Condemns the IRA in Speech

London - Military police in Dublin, the capital of the Irish Republic, went to a hotel today to search for "IRA" members and immediately arrested 13 people. Various security measures had been taken in advance to prevent incidents. Five machine guns and as many as 154 armed soldiers were deployed around the hotel. In addition, many "IRA" members in Belfast, Northern Ireland, broke into a house on Milton Road and destroyed it. It is generally speculated that when the authorities executed "IRA members" a few days ago, the owner of the house did not follow the "IRA's" instructions to close the blinds, which is probably why they were attacked. (Havas dispatch from the 19th)

Dublin - Chairman of the Executive Council of the Republic of Southern Ireland de Valera recently delivered a speech in Galway, condemning the terrorist acts committed by the "IRA" in Britain, stating that such actions only serve to hinder the freedom of the people and do not help resolve the issue of the unification of Northern and Southern Ireland.

### Gandhi Criticizes - British Policy Towards India - Says No Understanding Possible Between Britain and India at Present

The Hague - Regarding the appeal made to the Indian people by Lord Zetland, the British Secretary of State for India and Burma, Indian nationalist leader Gandhi published an article in the London "Times" yesterday to answer it, in which he did not spare any effort to criticize the British government's Indian policy. Gandhi declared that Zetland apparently believes that India can be controlled by Britain for a long time, and at the same time believes that London can decide India's future constitution. I ask to inform Zetland that the Indian nation has long been determined to be independent and will persevere as long as there is breath. As far as the present is concerned, there is no possibility of understanding between Britain and India, because the British government believes that the Indian constitution can be decided by British officials without the need for the Indian people to decide it. Gandhi strongly stated that if the British government does not change this attitude, Britain and India will never reach the issue of understanding. (Reuter dispatch from the 19th)

### Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Exhortation to the People (Continued from yesterday)

Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Second is to assist in military service construction and respect wounded soldiers. This means that our compatriots should, on the one hand, help with military service and, on the other hand, participate in the Friends of Wounded Soldiers movement. The wounded soldiers have already fulfilled their glorious and struggling responsibilities for defending the nation and the people. Our people should give them spiritual comfort and provide as much material help as possible. The New Life Movement Headquarters has organized many Friends of Wounded Soldiers societies in various places to promote general social service for wounded and sick officers and soldiers. Now, taking the opportunity of the sixth anniversary, it is establishing a general society and launching a movement to solicit friends for wounded soldiers, aiming to attract 100,000 friends of wounded soldiers. Of course, the more, the better. I hope all compatriots will respond and participate enthusiastically, directly repaying the merits of the wounded soldiers and indirectly enhancing the morale of the men fighting on the front lines. As for the thorough completion of the military service system, it is an important matter for our nation-building and army-building. Our compatriots should assist in propaganda and promote it in various ways, so that all able-bodied young men can automatically enlist, and families and society should supervise and encourage them together. Whether it is the consolation of new recruits or the regular consolation and assistance to the families of soldiers fighting in the war, all efforts should be made to implement it universally. Third is to assist in eradicating opium and improving national health. To improve national health, we must eliminate opium passively and promote national sports actively. To achieve this goal, we have established two organizations: the National Anti-Opium Association and the National Physical Education Promotion Association. As everyone knows, this year is the last year of the six-year opium prohibition plan. The government's ban on opium will not be suspended due to the war. It has been announced repeatedly that it will be completed as scheduled, but at the same time, the people of the whole country must unite to help eliminate it, so that it can be done quickly and thoroughly. I hope that compatriots in various places will spontaneously rise up, supervise each other, encourage each other, and mobilize social forces to provide medical and economic assistance to the opium addiction treatment centers, so that opium addicts can escape from their suffering. Furthermore, we must awaken our compatriots in the occupied areas, strive for self-respect, supervise each other, and break the enemy's conspiracy to poison us. As for the popularization of national sports, it is even more urgent during this important period of war and nation-building. I hope that compatriots in various places will recognize that cultivating the national physique and strengthening the national spirit are fundamental to the revival of the nation. Whether it is mountain climbing, swimming, boxing, national martial arts, or various modern exercises to strengthen the body, all should be organized into groups and enthusiastically promoted, depending on local conditions. By encouraging ourselves and others, and strengthening our bodies and our race, we will lay a solid foundation for a strong nation. Fourth is to promote the national economy and increase wartime production. Since the war, our seaports have been harassed and blockaded by the Japanese army, and the supply of materials has been difficult. But in fact, this is an opportunity for our national economy to be reborn. What we need to pay attention to most urgently is, first, to carry out consumer cooperation to regulate our supply and demand and suppress the prices of essential goods. Second, we must thoroughly eliminate Japanese goods and strengthen the anti-blockade movement. We must absolutely not sell raw materials and goods to the Japanese, and we must absolutely not allow Japanese goods to be sold in our territory, in order to break the Japanese economic invasion plan. Third, we must increase agricultural and industrial production. Except for those who are participating in the front lines and serving in labor services, all men and women in the country should choose a production enterprise, whether it is agriculture, horticulture, road construction, transportation, or handicraft manufacturing and simple industry, and actively work to the best of their ability. We must promote various competition methods to make wartime necessities and work can be improved day by day and continuously increased. The government has set up more than 1,000 industrial cooperatives, manufacturing various necessities of food, clothing and other living things. This kind of industry, is cooperative, simple, and has a quick effect, and does not require much capital. I hope people from all walks of life will promote it accordingly, so that the power of production can penetrate into the countryside. Fourth, we must reward and encourage livestock production and enhance transportation capacity. Our rural areas have always supplemented the economy by raising domestic animals. The western provinces of the rear are naturally famous livestock areas. I hope that the provincial governments and compatriots from all over the country can encourage livestock production, not only raising chickens and pigs, but especially working hard to breed horses, cattle, sheep and other animals to greatly increase production. On the one hand, it can enrich the economy, and at the same time, it can set up vehicles to facilitate transport and enhance our wartime transportation capacity. Fifth is to awaken our women compatriots and promote the women's movement. Women compatriots account for half of the country's population, which is where half of the power of our entire nation lies. Since the war, under the promotion of the Women's Guidance Committee, our female compatriots have participated in war zone services and have achieved significant results. For example, in childcare, 48 nurseries have been established, caring for tens of thousands of refugee children. Textile experimental areas and sericulture experimental areas have been established, and new women's handicraft cooperatives of New Life Movement have been organized and wartime family factories have been established, which have made great contributions to increasing production. This is really the most gratifying phenomenon. However, strictly speaking, only a very small number of female compatriots are participating in these works. We need to increase national strength, so that the majority of women compatriots can be mobilized to work together in families and in society, improve the national life, and strengthen the work of resisting the war. Therefore, this year, we especially hope that the women's new movement can be intensified to create greater achievements. The above five tasks are all closely related to the war and nation-building. I hope that all compatriots will act with the purpose of serving the society, and exert the enthusiasm of self-help and saving the country, to practice and strive together. I often say to the people of the country (the purpose of life is to improve the lives of all mankind, and the meaning of life is to create the life that succeeds the universe). Our current life is being oppressed by the Japanese military invasion, and the life of the nation is at a critical juncture of survival. Only by intensifying the spirit of propriety, justice, integrity, and honor can we break through the current turbulent waves. We must also know that we are fully confident in the final victory of our military resistance, but to achieve military victory, overcome the current difficulties, and establish a new foundation for construction, all the people of the country must renew from their lives, strive in their work, be self-reliant and constantly strive for progress. I wish all compatriots in the country will encourage each other, work hard to move forward, and complete the mission of our times. (19th telegram)

### Hong Kong Government Plans to Levy New Taxes

Hong Kong The Hong Kong government, in order to raise funds to donate to the British Empire's annual war expenses and pay for local special defense expenses, had drafted an income tax ordinance and submitted it to a specially designated committee for review. However, due to the fierce debate in the Legislative Council and the joint opposition of non-official members and public opinion, the committee was granted the power to study other fundraising methods during the review. It is now reported that the committee will soon recommend four special tax methods to the government for it to adopt one of them, namely, salary tax, corporate profit tax, business tax (similar to corporate tax), and property tax. After the wording of this report is finalized, it will be submitted to the authorities immediately. (Reuters, 18th)

### Japanese Troops in North China Launch Anti-Semitic Campaign Alleging Jewish Forces are Obstructing Japanese Aggression and Claiming that Japanese Aggression in China was Promoted by Jews

A Beijing dispatch from the Continental News of February 7th stated that the New People's Daily, controlled by the Japanese, is currently conducting an anti-Semitic campaign, clearly displaying

Nazi characteristics

The Japanese failed to agitate the Chinese people through an anti-British movement, so they began to oppose Jews, claiming that Jews are the greatest obstacle to the "New Order in East Asia." The Japanese editors of the New People's Daily have not changed their position despite the fact that China has only a small number of Jewish refugees. However, they understand that it is difficult to make people believe that the difficulties Japan has encountered on the mainland are due to a small number of Jews in China, so they expanded the

Anti-Semitic campaign

And used the invisible worldwide "Jewish forces." This campaign is now limited to the editorial page of the New People's Daily. If it is expanded, it will follow the anti-British movement that is dying out. Since the Chinese people have little reason to believe that China's current difficulties are the result of the activities of the British or "Jewish forces," Chinese observers say that the chances of success of the new movement are as slim as the anti-British movement. It is learned that the New People's Daily, the most important official newspaper in North China, began the current anti-Semitic campaign when the Japanese Yonai cabinet was formed. The first editorial of the newspaper on this matter stated briefly that in order to complete the construction of the New Order in East Asia, we hope that the new Japanese Yonai cabinet will put out Jewish forces in order to defeat the "Chiang regime." To achieve this goal, we hope that the Japanese cabinet will begin negotiations with

The United States and the Soviet Union

and other countries, in order to eradicate Jewish forces and cut off the relationship between the United Kingdom, the United States, and France and Chiang Kai-shek. During the negotiations, they should be careful to prevent Jewish conspiracies. Another editorial, entitled "The New Order and the United States," stated, "Prime Minister Yonai and Foreign Minister Arita have already clarified Japan's position. Now it is up to the United States to take steps to improve relations with Japan. However, Jewish capitalists in the United States are very powerful. If Jewish forces are not suppressed, future US-Japan meetings will not succeed." During the unproductive meeting held in Qingdao last month, the New People's Daily editorial urged the participants to pay special attention to the Jewish issue affecting the New Order, stating, "After close research, it is learned that the cause of the

China Incident

is the Jewish forces in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. To fundamentally solve the China Incident, we should defeat the Jewish forces in China. The Qingdao meeting "should give serious consideration to this issue." On the 7th of this month, the New People's Daily's editorial to send off "representatives of Chinese newspapers to Japan also stated that the corruption and bias of today's newspapers are caused by "Jewish forces." News organizations of civil countries, which have always been known for their freedom and justice, namely Reuters, Havas, Associated Press, and Tass, are all under the influence of

Jewish tycoons

and controlled by them, becoming the mouthpiece of Jewish millionaires. The periodicals and newspapers of these news agencies are also used by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union as propaganda tools. Civil country newspapers are trying to create war, so that their Jewish masters can take the opportunity to profit. The European War, the Spanish Civil War, the annexation of Czechoslovakia, and the China Incident were all promoted by Jewish tycoons, and all the disturbances in the world are caused by Jewish forces.

### Japanese Troops in Xuzhou Search Everywhere, Over a Thousand Households in Liuguzhuang, Tongshan are Burned, Japanese Troops in Peixian are Ambushed and Severely Wounded

A dispatch from Northern Jiangsu stated that the Japanese army headquarters in Xuzhou believed that various Chinese troops had repeatedly sabotaged railways, highways, and electric wires in the outskirts of Xuzhou, causing continuous blows to the Japanese puppet army, making it difficult for the Japanese puppet army to move. The Japanese puppet army, harboring resentment and revenge, has been looting and burning for the past month, but has not weakened the Chinese people's anti-Japanese sentiment. On the 12th of last month, more than 100 Japanese troops at the Sanbao Station on the Jinpu Railway, took three armored vehicles, first went to Ma, Lan, and burned down the schools and township government buildings, then went to Sujiahu to search, set fire to the village's schools and hospitals, and searched Chen Lingya's home, rummaging through boxes and cabinets, looting all the clothes, books and paintings, and then went to the Lin Guanzhuang temple warehouse, also set it on fire. The Tongshan Seventh District Standing Brigade then formed a bag-shaped formation to lure the Japanese puppet army to Liuguzhuang. Another mountain, Wang Bingyue, led the No. × Brigade, to greet the enemy head-on. Ji Fengru led the No. × Brigade, to attack from the left flank. Wu Huamin led the No. × Brigade, to attack from the right flank. Contact was made from 9:00 AM, and a fierce battle lasted for two hours. Eight Japanese soldiers were killed and six were wounded. The Chinese side also suffered heavy casualties. Later, because more than 100 Japanese troops from Baoguang Temple reinforced them, the Chinese Standing Brigade transferred its troops to avoid major sacrifices. The Chinese army only had one soldier killed and three wounded. The Japanese army, in their shame and anger, pointed out that Liuguzhuang was hiding guerrillas, and burned all the houses of the more than 300 households in the town. The fire was so bright that it lasted for three days and nights. The Japanese army also monitored the village, so the people did not dare to return to save it, causing more than 1,000 houses in the village, as well as the people's food, clothing, and all the property, to be burned into scorched earth. When the Japanese retreated, the people returned. Men, women, old and young, camped by the roadside in the cold wind, crying out in hunger and cold, and weeping together. The miserable scene was unbearable to witness. Li Fengru, the head of the Seventh District, said that because the district had been repeatedly ravaged by the Japanese puppet army, and the Japanese puppet village defense team had been constantly searching and looting, it was already ten rooms and nine empty. If they were to raise funds locally to provide relief again, there would be no surplus. Therefore, after a public decision in the district, representatives Liu Chengrui, Wang Huamin, and others were sent to the province to request relief funds from the authorities to relieve the suffering of the people and comfort the hearts of the people in the war zone.

On the 8th of last month, more than 100 Japanese troops in Peixian City attempted to level the road. After learning that the Chinese side was prepared, they fled back immediately. The Chinese side expected that the Japanese troops would come again the next day, so they ambushed on both sides of the road that night, from Dawangzhuang in the south to Miaodaokou in the north, a distance of more than ten li. Four squadrons of troops were ambushed in the west, and two squadrons of troops were ambushed in the east. They also buried five homemade electric mines on the highway between Weixiaolou and Weiying. County Chief Feng personally commanded. At 7:00 AM on the 9th, five Japanese vehicles, carrying more than 100 Japanese soldiers, one large gun, three hand mortars, and eight light and heavy machine guns, advanced north along the Peilong Highway. When they reached between Weixiaolou and Weiying, they triggered the electric mines, destroying two of the leading Japanese vehicles. More than 30 Japanese soldiers were torn to pieces. The Japanese soldiers in the two wrecked military vehicles hurriedly got out of the vehicles, and the Chinese ambush troops on both sides suddenly rose up and fired fiercely with concentrated firepower. More than 20 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. The remaining soldiers resisted stubbornly in Zhangzhuang Xiaowangzhuang. The last vehicle returned to the city for reinforcements. At about 9:00 AM, the Japanese army sent seven vehicles, carrying 170 or 180 Japanese soldiers, two large guns, five hand mortars, and more than ten light and heavy machine guns, from Longguji in the south to Miaodaokou to reinforce them. At the same time, more than 100 Japanese infantry and cavalry, carrying one large gun and five light and heavy machine guns, reinforced them from Peicheng to Dawangzhuang. All of them were met with a painful blow from the Chinese army. The Japanese army suffered extremely heavy casualties. After a fierce battle until 5:00 PM, the Japanese army broke through and fled. In this battle, more than 60 Japanese soldiers were killed, five Japanese war horses were killed, five Japanese bodies were left behind, two Japanese vehicles and many other military supplies were destroyed. Chen Zhaolan, the squadron leader, Hu Dezhen, the squad leader, Cui Fuzhen and other officers and soldiers, 11 in number, made heroic sacrifices. There were also 15 other officers and soldiers wounded. The Deputy Headquarters and the Provincial Government have recorded County Chief Feng's great merits once.

### Rice Robbery in Suzhou

The common people are panicked and take risks

Suzhou Correspondence: Due to the lack of rice and soaring prices, the rice stores in the city have closed one after another. The price of white rice per stone has reached 29 yuan, but there are still many who hoard and manipulate prices and Japanese merchants who absorb and transport it back to their country or transport it to Shanghai in an attempt to sell it at a higher price. The other day at a tea party, there was a small amount of rough rice, but it was still traded secretly at a high price. For example, Qianfeng Heng once again absorbed 25 stones of rough rice, and the amount of the secret transaction was 14 yuan and 10 cents. Therefore, it can only be seen that it is absorbing it, but the storefront is closed, and it has not been seen that it has been sold. Because the company has already hoarded more than 700 stones, its intentions can be imagined. The rice shortage for days has caused extreme panic among the common people. On the morning of the 14th, a rice robbery occurred on Zaoshi Street outside Xumen. Forty or fifty poor people, holding hemp bags and other tools, pried open the back door of the Tongfeng Brewery and rushed in to rob fifteen or six stones of rice piled up inside, and then dispersed in a commotion.

### Ministry of Education to Improve the Treatment of Primary School Teachers and Calculate Communication Salaries for Twelve Months

(Chongqing, 19th) Since President Chiang Kai-shek issued a telegram to primary school principals, teachers and staff, and people from all walks of life in the country in the middle of last month, people across the country have been extremely concerned about the issue of primary school teachers' treatment. On the 19th, the reporter made a special trip to the Ministry of Education to inquire about what recent measures the Ministry has taken in this regard. It is said that primary school education is related to the foundation of the country, and this year, the central government has paid great attention to primary school education, so it has increased the funds for compulsory education year by year. However, in recent years, various social undertakings have become increasingly developed, and the demand for people has increased many times, and the rewards are also more generous. Therefore, the original treatment of primary school teachers has become increasingly low, and many have changed to other jobs. The Ministry of Education has issued a special order to the education departments of all provinces and cities, requiring that the salaries of primary school teachers must be calculated on a twelve-month basis each year, and paid in full each month, and the salary amount should be appropriately increased. At the same time, it has also drafted a regulation on the treatment of primary school teachers, which includes detailed provisions on the treatment, protection, rewards, vacations, and free primary schools for children of primary school teachers. After the implementation of this method, the spiritual and material lives of primary school teachers will be improved, and it can be hoped that they will be happy in their work and cultivate talents for the country.

### Suppressing the Prices of Coal Balls, Rice, and Flour, the Panic Over Living Has Not Yet Ended, Hoping All Industries Will Handle Fair Prices, Coal Ball Industry Fair Sales to Begin Today, Rice Merchants Punished for Price Gouging

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association issued an important announcement yesterday, stating that coal balls are a necessary fuel, and the recent surge in market prices affects the lives of ordinary people. Failure to remedy this situation will inevitably lead to panic. The Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association has invited its members to jointly discuss temporary relief measures as follows: (1) Starting from the 20th of this month, the sales price of coal balls ex-factory (delivery from the factory) is 110 yuan per ton (transactions outside the factory must not exceed the factory price). Retail prices at factory outlets and coal shops throughout the city are 5.8 yuan per hundred catties (i.e., per dan), and must not be arbitrarily increased. (2) Those with coal ball warehouse receipts should pay the warehouse rent and pick up the coal within ten days, from the 20th to the 29th of this month. After the deadline, delivery will be suspended, and another method will be devised to recover the goods at the original price to supply the common people. (3) All coal shop operators without warehouse receipts should temporarily endure the hardship. From the 20th to the 29th of this month, do not rush to buy coal balls from the coal factories in the morning so that the factories can clear the warehouse receipts. Sales will resume in the afternoon for cash transactions. (4) Please coal factories produce as much as possible to prevent interruptions in supply. The above four measures are all for the purpose of stabilizing the market and overcoming difficulties together. A special joint notice is issued, and it is hoped that all coal ball manufacturers, coal shop operators, and warehouse receipt holders in the city will comply. It is reported that although the amount of coal balls stored in Shanghai is not as large as the rumored millions of tons, it is still hundreds of thousands of tons. It is unknown whether the fair sales will have unlimited quantities.

Advising the Coal Ball Industry to Produce as Much as Possible

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association yesterday, stating, "In response to your letter and the four resolutions attached regarding the rising price of coal balls, we have learned that the four measures resolved by your association are practical and comprehensive, and are completely based on the standpoint of taking the overall situation into account, emphasizing righteousness over profit, and are deeply admired. We have immediately published your four resolutions in the China News and the Xinmin Daily. We still hope that your association will notify its members to produce as much as possible so that there will be no shortage of supply. If small factories are affected by the lack of coal dust, the major factories should provide timely and uniform assistance to avoid interruptions. We hope that your association will maintain its perseverance and preside over the implementation." The Chamber also sent letters to the Coal Industry and Coal Shop Industry Associations to notify their members to strictly comply with the price limit.

Notice to Citizens Not to Accumulate Spot Goods

The Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association issued a notice yesterday, stating that the raw materials for coal balls have been fully secured and transported to Shanghai by the coal companies in the city to meet the needs of the city. The public organizations and celebrities are concerned about the people's livelihood and have agreed to request the shipping companies to reduce freight rates and transport raw materials. Therefore, the price drop is inevitable, and there may even be a situation of oversupply. As for the coal ball warehouse receipt issue, the public organizations have come forward to preside over the discussions and have a solution. Therefore, we hereby respectfully inform all users in the city not to listen to rumors and accumulate spot goods or entrust pre-orders. If individual users accumulate spot goods, it will inevitably cause producers to be doubly crowded and unable to cope, which in turn will create opportunities for warehouse receipt holders and coal shops to arbitrarily raise prices. It is rumored that prices have soared to over seven yuan per hundred catties, which is shocking. This is all due to the reaction of hoarders and users accumulating cash. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will correct this, so that the current panic situation can be eliminated.

Crowds Rush to Buy Fair-Priced Flour

To maintain the food supply for the people, the flour industry has designated 27 flour shops, including Ruiji, in the two concessions to implement fair-priced flour sales for one month starting yesterday. With the police maintaining order, fair sales were implemented. Each 49-pound bag was priced at 10.03 yuan, and 7,500 bags were sold at fair prices each day, supplied by Fufeng and Fuxin flour factories. Sales were conducted from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM until sold out. The crowds of ordinary people buying flour were no less than those buying rice. The flour shops sold out on schedule yesterday and immediately went to Fufeng and Fuxin factories to get more flour. Fair sales will continue today. During this fair sales period, flour shops will suspend sales of other brands of flour, benefiting the common people.

Noodle Industry Needs Fair-Priced Flour

The Noodle Industry, represented by Wang Jinwen and Wang Fuxin, yesterday reported to the Public Works Department the circumstances under which they had been forced to temporarily suspend business and submitted a report stating, "We are reporting the matter of skyrocketing flour prices and shortages. Since the shortage of rice and flour, our industry has done its best to maintain the market and has not raised prices. We have exhausted our efforts to purchase from various flour shops, but have been repeatedly rejected at high prices. Member shops have reported to the association that they have no goods to make and have been forced to suspend business. Although the authorities are now selling flour at fair prices, it is difficult to maintain the overall situation in Shanghai. Therefore, we respectfully report the situation and ask for assistance." It is reported that the industry has also requested the authorities to ask the flour shops to supply the industry with 3,000 bags of flour at fair prices each day to maintain business.

Chamber of Commerce Urges Prompt Opening

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce replied to the Noodle Industry Association yesterday, stating, "In response to your letter, we have learned that the skyrocketing price and shortage of flour is of concern to all parties and we are planning to remedy the situation. We have already told you everything yesterday. Your association's suggestion to stabilize prices can be achieved. However, the sale of noodles is as important as the sale of rice by rice shops. If the entire city suspends business, it will only contribute to panic, which must not happen. We urge your association to lead the industry and open for business as soon as possible."

Rice Merchant Punished with Detention for Violating the Law

Since the authorities in the concessions stipulated price limits for domestic rice, with indica rice not exceeding 33 yuan and japonica rice not exceeding 40 yuan, and sent detectives to the trading venues to monitor transactions and strictly prohibit transactions exceeding the price limits, on the 17th, rice broker Du Hongshou (resident of No. 217 Qinghe Lane, Sapo Road), from Haining, and Qu Baizhen (resident of No. 10 Xincai City Road), manager of Fongsheng Rice Shop at No. 467 Fujian Road, were arrested by Zhang Yingmei, a Chinese detective of the Public Works Department's Political Department, and detective Mao Guobao for exceeding the price limits.

The details of the incident are as follows: (1) At 10:30 AM on the 17th, rice broker Du Hongshou went to the rice market at Qinglian Pavilion Teahouse, No. 515 Fuzhou Road, to sell a sample of japonica rice. When market manager Yin Yuzhang asked about the price, Du quoted 53.5 yuan per stone. The detectives heard about this and, believing that Du's quoted price violated the law and exceeded the price limit, arrested him. (2) The detectives of the Public Works Department's Political Department learned that the

Fongsheng Rice Shop

at No. 467 Fujian Road was selling rice exceeding the price limit. On the 15th, they instructed officials Xu Zhongshen and coolie Wu Changchun to purchase three yuan worth of No. 2 white rice, which weighed only 9.545 catties. Calculating the price per stone, it would reach 50 yuan. They then obtained an arrest warrant from the First Special Court and arrested the manager of the shop, Qu Baizhen. Yesterday morning, they were both sent to the Ninth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Fang Zhishan, the police lawyer, explained the incident and prosecuted them for

Violating the Law

in violation of Article 33 of the Police Offenses Punishment Law. He also requested that the defendants be severely punished according to the law, as their actions endangered social stability. After questioning by Judge Shen Shanzeng, Du Hongshou and Qu Baizhen were sentenced to 15 days of detention each as a warning.

Rice Prices Drop Again as Fair Sales Approach

After the Fair Sales Committee decided to hold a second round of fair sales starting on the 23rd, it decided to redistribute measuring instruments. The concession authorities also decided to issue a notice. The common people were overjoyed to hear that fair sales were approaching. The closed rice shops have not yet reopened. As for rice prices, due to the approaching fair sales and the closure of rice shops, demand has sharply decreased. Therefore, there was a third price drop yesterday, which benefited the general public. It is estimated that No. 1 Saigon dropped by about one yuan, mixed broken rice dropped by 50 cents, and Danyang white dropped by one yuan. In total, since the closure of rice shops three days ago, each commodity has dropped by an average of two to four yuan. Therefore, fair sales are the only way to suppress rice prices. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will hold them for a long time to benefit the citizens.

Over 30,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive Again

The price of foreign rice in the city has already exceeded the price limit for domestic rice. The source of domestic rice is blocked, so the black market price has exceeded the 50 yuan mark. If no measures are taken to suppress the price, the future of the people's livelihood is worrying. As for foreign rice, it should not continue to rise continuously. Although it is affected by the shortage of foreign exchange, the capital used to purchase the rice currently on sale in the market is not the current exchange rate. The crux of the matter is self-evident. It is reported that on the 19th, Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng轮 brought 15,638 bags from Hong Kong, and Ding Sheng轮 also brought 7,070 bags from Hong Kong. In addition to 4,944 bags from Hong Kong, Taikoo's Jiangsu轮 also brought 7,694 bags from Haiphong. The three ships brought a total of 35,346 bags on the 19th.

### Murder Case at Central Hotel Last Night, Lu Yuting Assassinated, Three Bullets in Vital Areas, Died of Injuries, Gunman Escaped and Was Hunted

At around 7 PM last night, a murder case occurred at No. 228 Central Hotel, Wuma Road, Public Concession. The victim was Lu Yuting, from Henan, who had been living in Shanghai for many years. He was shot three times and immediately taken to the hospital, but died of his injuries. The killer escaped and is being hunted. The details are as follows:

Opened a Teahouse with Many Connections

Lu Yuting, from Hanzhuang, Shenqiu County, northeast of Henan, was 41 years old. He used to run the Dongxinglou Restaurant on Shilu and Wuma Roads, but later closed it down. He usually had many connections and had joined the circle of the late Lu Liankui, who favored him. Recently, he often went in and out of the western part of Shanghai, which attracted attention. Therefore, it is generally believed that the case may be a political event.

Three Men Suddenly Came and Shot Him

At 6:45 PM last night, Lu Yuting was handling affairs in his usual manner at Room 228 of the Central Hotel. At the same time, Lu had made an appointment with another person surnamed Lu to have dinner in the room. Suddenly, two men in Western suits and one man in Chinese clothes, all wearing riding breeches and woolen overcoats, went straight upstairs and lingered for a long time in the lobby on the second floor. Just as the tea boy went to another place to make tea, the three strong men broke into Lu's residence. At that time, Lu was wandering in the room. The three men saw Lu and immediately drew their guns and shot him.

Shot Three Times, the Killer Escaped

Seeing the people coming with weapons, Lu tried to avoid them, but a bullet flew over and hit Lu's forehead. A second bullet hit his chest, and a third bullet hit his waist. He immediately bled profusely and suddenly fell to the ground. Seeing that their purpose had been achieved, the killers quietly went out the door. At that time, the guests in the rooms nearby suddenly heard gunshots and were quite afraid. They only heard someone calling out "robbery" and did not dare to ask questions. The killers were able to go downstairs and escape into the crowd during that moment.

Died of Vital Injuries

The tea boy of the hotel immediately entered Room 228 to check and saw that Lu had fallen in a pool of blood. He immediately reported to the police. Later, Western police officer No. 137 and Chinese detective Liu Junqing and others from the Old Gate Police Station arrived at the scene. The injured Lu Yuting was sent to Renji Hospital by ambulance, but died of his vital injuries at 7:15 PM.

The Body Will Be Coffin Today

Lu lives at No. 19 Yuren Lane, Yunnan Road, Hongde Hospital upstairs. He has a younger brother named Lanting, a wife named Lu Xu, a son named Bingsheng, who is six years old, and two adopted daughters, Shuying and Shuzhen, who are still unmarried. For the convenience of interacting with all parties, Lu opened a long-term room at No. 228 Central Hotel. Last night, after hearing the news of the shooting, his wife rushed to inquire and cried for a long time when she saw Lu bleeding all over. She then went to the hospital to take care of his funeral. Lu's body will be moved to the Dazhong Funeral Home on Changping Road today for encoffining.

### Chamber of Commerce Sincerely Admonishes Merchants and People Not to Hoard or Collect, Hoping Residents Will Not Wholesale or Pre-Purchase, Giving People the Opportunity to Speculate

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a sincere admonition to merchants and people yesterday, stating, "Since the New Year, prices of all goods have soared, even more fiercely than last year. The three items of rice, coal, and flour alone are enough to make it difficult for ordinary salaried people to support a family and have nothing to cook with."

People Are In Panic

They cannot live in peace. The sense of oppression in the lives of the city's residents is greater today than ever before. As for the reasons, the high cost of transportation, the difficulty of procurement, the increase in floating expenses, and the tightening of foreign exchange are all sufficient to contribute to the rise in prices, and cannot be attributed solely to one party. However, a portion of people are taking advantage of the opportunity

To Engage In Private Profits

Taking commodities as a speculative goal and hoarding as a shortcut to wealth, this is also a blatant fact. Moreover, there are those who are not merchants, but are confused by rumors and believe that collecting commodities is more sure than storing funds, pushing the boat along the water and creating this situation. Those residents with foresight

Cannot Help But Be Wary

And can only use all their belongings to wholesale and pre-purchase to supply several months of consumption. Supply and demand are increasingly unbalanced, and unknowingly, this gives these people the opportunity to speculate. Therefore, today's situation of soaring prices cannot be blamed solely on the situation and has nothing to do with the people of Shanghai. It must be known that mutual benefit is the greatest benefit. If the current situation

Continues to Evolve

Then at least 90 percent of the city's residents will lose their purchasing power. The foundation of commerce is ultimately built on the majority of consumers. If the majority of the people turn into exhausted carp waiting for death, with no consumers to buy, then the hoarded materials will also turn into frozen stones. If these few people think they have seized the opportunity and dream of this year's

Golden Age

And think it will be far better than last year, this kind of thinking is a mistaken illusion and will inevitably lead to mutual destruction and falling into the abyss. This is what the Chamber of Commerce sincerely admonishes to awaken the deaf and blind. At this time when the political program is out of control and beyond our reach, we rely on everyone's conscious awareness to reverse the catastrophe of panic in the city. We respectfully offer this advice and hope you will all take it to heart."

### 京滬路　路軌被炸　在奔牛以東　燬貨車四節

The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Pao" reports that, according to travelers arriving in this city yesterday (the 18th), an explosion occurred on the Jinghu Railway east of Benniu on Saturday and Sunday nights, destroying a section of the railway and four freight cars. The Jinghu Railway is still maintaining passenger traffic as usual. Passengers arriving at the damaged area must disembark and walk about half a mile to board another train. It is believed that guerrillas planted the landmines that caused the explosion. Benniu is located west of Changzhou, about 130 kilometers from Nanjing. According to a news agency, aviation industry sources say that three train cars were bombed and overturned near Xinfeng Station between Zhenjiang and Shanghai on the Jinghu Railway on the morning of the 18th, and the tracks were also destroyed. The cause of the bombing is currently unknown here.

### 救世軍遣送難胞　利堪造紙公司　昨捐鉅款兩萬

Salvation Army Major Morris announced that at yesterday's luncheon, staff of the Dutch Bank's Li Kan Paper Company donated a large sum of 20,000 yuan, suddenly increasing the total donations to 100,000 yuan. In addition to this large donation, miscellaneous donations totaling about 50,000 yuan were received this week. The Army is planning to use this 20,000 yuan to send refugees who can return to their hometowns and to provide urgently needed loans to those seeking a livelihood. Morris expressed his admiration for the enthusiastic donations from the Chinese people, believing that they have greatly benefited the refugees. The Army also received a donation of 500 yuan from the French Ambassador to China yesterday.

Serving the People

Since the Shanghai Salvation Army launched its fundraising campaign, it has been widely sympathized with by all sectors of society. The Army's office has been crowded with people making donations. Mr. Ma Ruishan, the Shanghai District Officer of the Army, sent a special letter to all sectors of society yesterday, saying: "To Whom It May Concern, the Army has been engaged in various relief efforts in Shanghai for twelve years, and has been honored by the approval of all sectors of society. As the city's economy declines, the number of poor people is increasing daily. The Army's work over the past ten years has been based on the spirit of love to serve the people and strive hard, but its ability to expand its scope of service depends on the sympathy and assistance of all sectors of society."

Relying on Assistance

Since the August 13th battle, the Army has been serving in refugee relief work. Through its interactions with the refugees, it is deeply aware of their suffering and feels a sense of helplessness. There are countless people in need of assistance. Therefore, a certain Chinese philanthropist recently expressed his willingness to donate [blank] yuan to the Army's expenses anonymously, which shows his sympathy and recognition of the Army's good intentions. We have always admired your concern for the victims of disasters. If you trust the Army's past measures and do not deviate from the original purpose of the grant, we sincerely hope that you will provide strong assistance and advocate for it. The Army's 1940 budget depends on this. Every penny will be used to benefit the poor, regardless of geographical differences or ethnic divisions. The service extends to Chinese and foreign compatriots alike. We enclose a copy of this city's monthly publication for your reference, and we hope you will not hesitate to give us your advice. Thank you very much.

### 禁止進口貨外僑購用辦法

The Zhejiang Customs Superintendent and Tax Commissioner issued a notice stating that the measures for banning the import of foreign goods during the extraordinary period and the measures for prohibiting the import of goods made from prohibited imported foreign raw materials in guerrilla areas have been announced by the Customs separately. Now, a telegram from the Ministry of Finance states that all foreign nationals in China who purchase and transport prohibited imported goods for their own use shall apply for an import permit in accordance with the regulations to be verified and released by the Customs. In addition to complying with this, a notice is hereby issued to inform the public.

### 北江西路鐵絲網　日方着手撤除　沿路商店營業蕭條異常　虧蝕倒閉者已達卅餘家

The eastern side of North Jiangxi Road, north of Suzhou Creek, was blocked by the Japanese last autumn with barbed wire and steel frames, stretching for several miles from Bazilu in the north to Tiantonglu in the south. Only gaps were opened at Haininglu and Wenjianshi Road to allow residents to enter the Hongkou area. Two guard posts were set up on both sides of the gaps, manned by Japanese soldiers who inspected residents entering and leaving. Since the Japanese announced the opening of the Hongkou and other areas, the area can now be freely accessed. However, the sentries are still not withdrawn. The Japanese soldiers have now begun to remove the section of barbed wire and steel frame at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Bazilu. It is said that they will continue to clear it later. However, the businesses in the blocked area have suffered greatly due to obstructed traffic, leading to a lack of customers and extremely sluggish business. More than 30 businesses have closed down one after another due to losses and bankruptcy.

### 寗漢段長江開放　日方不允考慮　美大使經滇越路赴渝　日方亦未作安全佈置

The Reuter correspondent in Tokyo reported on the 18th that, regarding the rumor in Shanghai that US Ambassador to China Johnson plans to meet with the British and French ambassadors in Chongqing to request that Japan open the Yangtze River between Nanjing and Hankou, the Japanese Navy spokesman recently told reporters that this may not be realized. As Japan has not yet completed its preparations for opening the Yangtze River below Nanjing, it will not consider opening the Yangtze River between Nanjing and Hankou. As for Johnson's taking the Yunnan Railway, which is still being bombed by the Japanese, the Navy spokesman claimed that he had not heard that the travel plan had been notified to the Japanese side, nor had he heard of any special arrangements to ensure Johnson's safety. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stated that it had not heard of the US Ambassador's travel plan, but said that Johnson may have notified the local Japanese authorities.

### 駐菲副領朱少屏　發展華僑敎育　朱氏已於上月抵岷履新本埠得訊各界歡迎熱烈

Mr. Zhu Shaoping, a senior cadre of the Shanghai YMCA, was recently appointed as the new Deputy Consul at the Consulate General in Manila. According to news from Manila, Mr. Zhu arrived in Manila on the morning of the 29th of last month aboard President Puck's ship. Consul General Yang Guangxing, Consul Mo Jien, Secretary Huang Rongde, and Standing Committee members Wang Quansheng and Xu Youchao all went to the pier to welcome him and escorted him to the Datong Hotel to rest. Mr. Zhu is in his fifties, full of energy, and extremely [blank]. According to him, he boarded the ship in Hong Kong on the evening of the 26th, which was the day the US-Japan commercial treaty expired. Most Americans in Hong Kong expressed their unwillingness to renew the treaty. When asked if he had been to the Philippines before, Mr. Zhu said that this was his fourth time. Consul General Yang specifically hosted a welcome dinner for Mr. Zhu at the Oriental Club that afternoon.

New Plans of the Consulate General

Consul General Yang of the Manila Consulate General recently made a statement to reporters after the arrival of the newly appointed Deputy Consul Zhu Shaoping. He said that Mr. Zhu's coming to Manila to take office is responsible for the management of overseas Chinese education in the Philippines. He hopes that the leaders of the overseas Chinese education community and the students of various schools in the Philippines will cooperate to make overseas Chinese education more rationalized and to promote it further. The Consulate General has new plans for overseas Chinese education this year. The main points are as follows: (A) Regarding faculty and staff, Deputy Consul Zhu Shaoping will contact the Overseas Chinese Education Association in this city to ensure that the schools work hard to implement the following three things: (1) Universal Mandarin instruction, (2) Launching the New Life Movement, starting from the schools and spreading it to all overseas Chinese compatriots in the Philippines, (3) Convening an all-Philippines overseas Chinese education conference, with the Overseas Chinese Education Association as the base camp, convening the education conference in Manila to review the past and plan for the future, and to establish the direction of overseas Chinese education in the Philippines. (B) Regarding students, there is currently an organization called the Overseas Chinese Students' Union in this city, but its work is slightly lax. The Consulate General has begun to investigate and collect statistics on Chinese students in various universities in this bird [typo], and to launch its organization. University students have a greater responsibility than other primary and secondary school students for the tasks of the motherland and leading overseas students in carrying out wartime work. It is hoped that overseas Chinese university students in this island will have an organization like the American Chinese University Students' Union to carry out various national salvation activities, such as publishing publications and contacting student leaders and faculty members from various schools to carry out anti-Japanese propaganda work for the motherland. In addition to the "Overseas Chinese Students' Union" and the "Philippine Chinese Students' National Salvation Association," other student groups that are about to be established include the "Guangdong Students' Union in the Philippines." Mr. Zhu will be responsible for guiding all of these student groups.

Japanese Attempt to Invade Keqiao

The Battle is Extremely Fierce

Since the Japanese army secretly crossed the Qiantang River and landed in Xiaoshan, China has dispatched a large army to block them. The Japanese army that landed is already unable to withstand the pressure. The Japanese army stationed in Xiaoshan is attempting to invade Keqiao in Shaoxing and Jianshan in Zhuji in two directions. The Chinese army is fiercely resisting. Yesterday, a telegram from Shaoxing to Shanghai reported that the Japanese army attempted to invade Keqiao, and the battle was fierce. Shaoxing is as peaceful as usual. The telegram from Shanghai to Shaoxing and the long-distance telephone from Ningbo to Shaoxing are still open and have not been interrupted. The coastal areas are also peaceful, but the population of each county has been evacuated.

### 熱水業定期　召開會員大會

The Hot Water Industry to Hold a General Meeting of Members on Schedule

More than 500 hot water shops have been affected by the rising coal prices. Except for a few that still have coal reserves and can barely maintain their operations, most hot water shops have decided to close down. Residents, institutions, organizations, and schools are deeply inconvenienced. All sectors of society sympathize with the industry's difficulties and will provide assistance. It is hoped that the industry association will clearly identify the issues and handle them step by step in order to quickly resolve the problem. According to a reporter from "New Voice News," the Hot Water Industry Association has scheduled a general meeting of all industry representatives for the afternoon of the 25th of this month to seek solutions to the coal shortage. It is said that the steps to be taken in the future will be decided at that time. The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession has sent investigators to the association for several days to investigate and summoned Mr. Zhang Deji, the chairman of the association, to inquire about the coal supply and market prices of coal companies in the past, in order to find ways to suppress coal prices.

### 紹屬旅滬同鄉會　募捐賑濟蕭紹難民　錢江前綫流離失所者數十萬盼同鄉及各界仕女慷慨解囊

The Shaoxing Native Place Association in Shanghai is Raising Donations to Relief the Xiaoshao Refugees. Hundreds of Thousands of People are Displaced on the Front Line of Qiantang River. We Hope that Compatriots and Ladies from All Walks of Life Will Contribute Generously.

After the outbreak of war in eastern Zhejiang, news of unrest in Xiaoshao spread. Residents on the front line south of the Qiantang River, supporting the old and leading the young, crying for hunger and cold, and displaced, numbered in the hundreds of thousands. The Shaoxing Native Place Association in Shanghai, with its deep hometown ties, could not sit idly by. It has ordered the design and dispatch of personnel to Shaoxing to handle relief efforts. However, this is a major matter, which requires a huge amount of money and needs to be used urgently. Yesterday, it issued a special notice to the people of Shaoxing in Shanghai, asking them to act according to their conscience, those with money to contribute money, those with strength to contribute strength, and to automatically assist in solving the urgent needs together. It is hoped that ladies from all walks of life will take the heart of saving others as saving themselves, and contribute generously and enthusiastically. The designated collection points have been established: Bank of China (Avenue Joffre), Minfu Bank (Tianjin Road, Jiangxi Road), Zhongyi Trust Company (Beijing Road), Anyu Qianzhuang (Ningbo Road, Xingrenli), Tongrun Qianzhuang (Tianjin Road, Jiyili), Baofeng Qianzhuang (Tianjin Road). Many people have enthusiastically pledged donations in recent days.

### 英日間將恢復　磋商天津問題　雙方現正凖備解決基礎惟淺間丸事件尚多爭執

The British and Japanese Will Resume Negotiations on the Tianjin Issue. Both Sides are Now Preparing the Groundwork for a Solution, but There are Still Many Disputes Over the Asama Maru Incident.

The Reuter correspondent in Tokyo reported on the 18th that Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, recently suffered a severe cold and went to Hayama for recuperation. He is now recovering. It is observed that after Sir Craigie returns to Tokyo, he will resume negotiations on the Tianjin issue. Regarding this issue,

Meetings Between British and Japanese

Low-level officials have been ongoing for some time, but formal discussions have been hampered by the Asama Maru incident. British authorities today told reporters that they believe there is a good chance of reaching a solution to the Tianjin issue. At this moment, however, it is necessary to prepare the groundwork for a solution. Hachiro Arita's reappointment as Foreign Minister is a favorable factor, as Arita is familiar with this issue and Japan is concerned about the negotiations

Satisfactory Conclusion

As for the Asama Maru incident, the British authorities admitted that the issue of the remaining German prisoners has not been resolved. This point will depend on whether Japanese political leaders intend to strive for an immediate solution or leave it for later discussion. Although various obstacles still exist,

A Sense of Things

Has Improved. What the British authorities believe is, of course, different from Arita's hopeful remarks on the Tianjin issue in the Diet recently. It is worth noting that although the Japanese are now busy dealing with other matters, they are still unremitting in their request for the return of the Germans still detained by the British.

The Women's Community Launches a "No Perm" Movement

The Shanghai Women's Federation received a suggestion from Ms. Qin Shuluan yesterday, requesting the promotion of a "no perm" movement for women, stating that hair is a natural gift. Our women's community originally implemented haircuts for convenience and thrift. Recently, perms have become popular, wasting time, money, and posing unexpected dangers. Not perming has natural beauty. Especially recently, prices in Shanghai have been rising. Our female compatriots should implement the "no perm movement" for the sake of self-help and helping others, and transfer the savings to disaster relief funds. I hope you will promote it.

### 學校遷讓　拆除裝修另件　江海小學校長被控竊盜罪兩造各執一詞候勘明再核

School Relocation, Dismantling and Repairing of Parts. The Principal of Jianghai Primary School is Accused of Theft. Both Sides Have Different Opinions. The Case is Awaiting Inspection and Review.

Hua An (i.e., Hua Hou) from Zhejiang Province founded Jianghai Primary School at No. 318 Weihaiwei Road, which has been in operation for six or seven years. The landlord has also changed hands several times. In October last year, Wu Yonghua, the owner of Lihua Automobile Hardware Store at No. 367 Weihaiwei Road, bought the property from the owner Li Yangzhi for 20,750 yuan, intending to

Take it Back for His Own Use

Therefore, Wu Yonghua filed a lawsuit against Hua An in the Civil Court of the First Special District Court, requesting relocation. After the trial, the two parties reached a settlement. On December 6th last year, Hua An was ordered to relocate before the end of February of this year, and Wu Yonghua would subsidize the relocation fee of 4,000 yuan. At that time, except for the initial payment of 3,500 yuan, the remaining 500 yuan would be paid after the house was handed over. Recently, Hua is beginning to relocate in succession, but the original flushing toilets, fireplaces, doors and windows in the room are

All Dismantled

Sold to the old goods store opened by Guan Weibin at No. 557 Beijing Road for a price of 240 yuan. Wu Yonghua learned about this and reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station for stealing buildings, and sent Detective Ni Runsheng to detain Hua An and put him in the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division 8 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyers Jiang Baolian, Peng Qixin, and Chen Shuzhi stated the case and prosecuted according to Article 320 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, Hua An confessed that

Six or Seven Years Ago

I invested 2,500 yuan to take over the New Life Primary School and renamed it Jianghai Primary School. All the decorations and parts were included. Now that I have relocated, I will of course dismantle them. Therefore, what I dismantled was not the landlord's property. According to Wu Yonghua's complaint, the dismantled items were iron pipes inside the walls, as well as flushing toilets and fireplaces, which were originally the landlord's property. The defendant should not have dismantled and sold them privately. He also hired a lawyer to appear in court and filed a civil lawsuit requesting compensation for losses of more than 5,000 yuan. Judge Zhan held that

The Items in Dispute

Whose property they belong to is difficult to determine at once because the owner has changed hands several times. It is necessary to conduct an on-site inspection. He ordered the defendant to be detained and reviewed after an inspection at 3 pm today.

Later, a settlement was reached at the police station, and Xu resigned from his position as manager and abandoned the bonus and special reward he was entitled to.

Shi Zhongfu (34 years old, resident of No. 22 Guangdong Road), the deputy manager of Huaxin Embroidery Company at No. 160 Avenue Edward VII, and a native of Pudong, took advantage of his position from September last year to January this year and took advantage of the fact that his owner Zhang Zhengyi was unfamiliar with English to handle the procedures for remittances and transactions for overseas merchant Lido Company and Canadian Youliubing Company, and with American Chase Bank. Shi secretly hid the bills of exchange remitted by the foreign merchants, and induced Zhang to issue Chase Bank checks that had not been filled in with numbers, ostensibly to pay small amounts, but in reality filled in huge amounts. Recently, Zhang detected this and commissioned Lawyer Ma to report to the police and arrest Shi. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the First Special District Court and prosecuted for embezzlement. The plaintiff also commissioned Lawyer Ma to file a civil lawsuit requesting that the defendant be ordered to repay 18,101 yuan in national currency. Judge Yue took the stand for the trial. The defendant admitted the embezzlement and requested leniency, willing to clear the accounts after his release and repay the full amount. After verifying the confession in court, Shi Zhongfu was sentenced to one year and two months of imprisonment for continuous embezzlement, with a three-year suspended sentence.

### Abridged Edition of the Complete Library

Pre-Sale Reservations

In 1929 and 1934, the Commercial Press successively compiled and printed the first and second collections of the Complete Library, contributing a complete library of books to society. Thousands of basic libraries in China and abroad were established using this library. Since the outbreak of the war, cultural facilities have been largely destroyed. The people in the rear and emerging schools are in urgent need of reference books. The press, feeling that it is essential to provide cultural sustenance during this extraordinary period, has selected 500 of the most needed books from the first and second collections of the Complete Library and reorganized them into a complete system, maintaining the spirit of the original library while adapting to current needs even more. The entire compilation consists of 1,200 volumes, printed at the press's Shanghai and Hong Kong factories. 300 volumes have already been published. The Shanghai distribution center of the press is now taking pre-sale reservations. It is said that the price is 260 yuan, only one-fifth of the price of the first and second collections, in order to reduce the burden on purchasers. In addition to the already published portion, those who pre-order can receive them immediately. The remaining books are scheduled to be completed within four months, so that those who subscribe to the abridged edition can establish a concise small library in the shortest possible time.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange News Favors Sellers; British and American Exchange Rates Slightly Ease

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no change in the HSBC official rate. The black market rates for British and American currencies showed a slight easing trend. However, foreign firms continued to absorb forward contracts, and market rumors were unsubstantiated. Consequently, many who had profited in February were willing to sell during this period of consolidation. Moreover, Hong Kong Electric continued to release funds, and although HSBC absorbed spot currency, it was willing to supply forward contracts. As a result, a squeeze play ultimately emerged. The initial rates were flat, at 4 pence 1/15625 and 6.875 yuan. Shortly after, foreign firms suddenly settled some contracts, but fortunately, foreign banks such as Mercantile Bank were willing to supply currency, causing only a slight softening. The American exchange rate could be settled at 6.84375 yuan. Later, Hong Kong Electric suddenly dumped currency, and Chinese banks and speculators followed suit, coupled with negative rumors in the market, causing a sharp hardening to 4 pence 203125 and 6.9375 yuan. However, Sassoon quickly moved in to absorb currency, and foreign firms continued to purchase, causing a subsequent softening. However, as Chinese merchants had made significant profits, they came back to sell, leading to a slight hardening again. In the afternoon, due to selling by the Tianjin gang and dumping by foreign banks such as Banque Belge pour l'Étranger, the rate briefly hardened to 4 pence 234375 and 7.03125 yuan. Later, a Japanese textile mill wanted to take delivery of forward sterling, and foreign firms continued to settle contracts, so the closing rates were 4 pence 203125 and 6.96875 yuan, with the British pound down 0.0625 and the American dollar up 0.09375 compared to last weekend. The potential trend of futures was no different from spot rates.

Triggering a Selling Spree Among Chinese Merchants

In the morning, due to the London market being closed for Bank Holiday, and the American bank rate and price of pure gold being unavailable, exchange rates for British, American, and French currencies were flat. The rate against Shanghai narrowed by 0.0625. The American rate against the British pound fell by 0.125. The rates against Shanghai and French currencies were flat. The Central Bank's official rates for various currencies remained unchanged. The morning opening spot selling rates for banks were 4 shillings and 25625 pence for British gold and 6.875 yuan for the American dollar, with no change compared to last Saturday. After the opening, although foreign firms were absorbing currency, foreign banks such as Mercantile Bank were willing to supply, so there was not much impact. It was estimated that Mercantile Bank settled American currency for March at 6.75 yuan. At that time, the spot price showed a slightly soft trend, with the American dollar only settling at 6.84375 yuan. Fortunately, Hong Kong Electric immediately released currency, and pharmaceutical companies followed suit to sell. A small number of Chinese merchants also triggered a selling spree, so the market suddenly turned hard. It was estimated that Hong Kong Electric sold spot British gold to foreign banks at 4 shillings 1875 pence, and Chinese banks sold spot American currency to HSBC at 6.90625 yuan. HSBC's official rates were announced as unchanged. The silver balancing tax was also announced with no increase or decrease. After this, a certain rumor occurred in the market regarding a certain country, so the market situation continued to harden. It was estimated that Chinese merchants sold American currency for this month to foreign banks at 6.90625 yuan. At that time, the spot price hardened to 31115 pence and 6.9375 yuan. Unexpectedly, Sassoon suddenly moved in to absorb currency, and foreign firms resumed settling forward American currency, so the market sentiment slightly tightened. It was estimated that Sassoon purchased spot British gold from foreign banks at 4 shillings 1875 pence, and foreign firms absorbed American currency for April from HSBC at 6.65625 yuan. Afterwards, it stabilized for a while. Around 11:00 AM, Chinese merchants continued to release their profits, causing the trend to soften again. It was estimated that Chinese merchants sold American currency for March to foreign banks at 6.875 yuan, and American currency for this month at 6.9375 yuan. By the close, British gold was quoted at 203125 pence, and the American dollar was at 6.9375 yuan, compared to the morning opening, the British pound was down 0.046875, and the American dollar was up 0.065.

Tianjin Gang Liquidates Long Positions

The afternoon market opened slightly harder, at 4 pence 11875 and 6.96825 yuan. Subsequently, the Tianjin gang continued to liquidate long positions, and foreign firms and Chinese firms dumped currency, so it continued to soften and harden. It was estimated that the Tianjin gang dumped spot American currency to foreign banks at 7 yuan and 7.03125 yuan, and Banque Belge pour l'Étranger sold spot American currency to counterparts at 7 yuan. At that time, the spot British gold also hardened to 4 pence 234375. Unexpectedly, at that time, a Japanese textile mill suddenly limited the purchase of British gold for April at 4 pence 125, but due to a lack of willingness to supply from foreign banks, the market situation softened. It was estimated that foreign firms absorbed American currency for March from foreign banks at 6.875 yuan. Around 3:00 PM, the spot price softened to 4 pence 203125 and 6.9375 yuan. Afterwards, there were fewer buyers, and the situation hardened again. By the close, British gold was at 4 pence 21875, and the American dollar was at 6.96875. British gold for this month was the same as the previous price, American currency was at 6.9375 yuan, British gold for the next month was at 4 pence 15625, and American currency was at 6.84375 yuan. As a result, there was a squeeze play of 0.0625 and 0.09375 compared to last weekend.

### Sudden Arrival of Negative News; Gold Prices Rebound and Fall

The cash smelted raw gold black market situation yesterday reversed the upward trend of the previous weekend, suddenly turning into a downward wind. Because the exchange market slightly recovered, and there were some negative rumors again in the market, people's hearts suddenly turned. Many profit-taking households came out to sell, and the Hong Kong gang's appetite was weak. Although the Tianjin gang occasionally dragged in, the chips were ultimately filled, and the result fell by more than 100 yuan. The morning opening was a sharp decline of 30 yuan, to 4830 yuan. Soon, some money exchange industries and others competed to sell vigorously, and at that time, the exchange market showed weakness, and there were negative rumors in the market, so it fell by another 50 yuan. Later, securities firms and a certain order number suddenly bought on behalf of customers, and foreign exchange had also softened, and the sellers turned out to be tied up, so the rebound was extremely fast, rising to 4820 yuan. Finally, because foreign exchange hardened again, a selling spree started again. Securities firms first turned from buying to selling, and at the same time, some money exchange industry bulls came to sell again, and the market situation became difficult again. In the afternoon, foreign exchange was loosened, and some money exchange industries sold again, and it was even more unsustainable, once falling to a low price of 4700 yuan. Then, the Tianjin gang came to activity again, and the exchange market softened, so it rebounded by 70 yuan. Finally, due to the favorable foreign exchange report, another securities firm and a certain bank sold, so the evening closing was only 4728 yuan, a decline of 132 yuan compared to last Saturday. The entire day's trading was active, about 4000 taels. The result of jewelry gold was a small discount of 10 yuan. Customs gold and other golds remained flat.

Smelted Raw Gold Plunges More Than 100 Yuan

Since morning, each bar (50 taels), at the initial opening, because the exchange market reported hardening, people's hearts turned tired. A certain money exchange industry first came to sell vigorously, and a certain bank also forcefully sold on behalf of customers, so there was a lack of daily buyers for a time, leading to a small decline of 30 yuan compared to last weekend at the 9:30 AM opening. A certain bank released 10 taels to the money exchange industry, for 4830 yuan. Shortly after, there were even more negative rumors in the market, so it fell by another 5 yuan in the selling wind, breaking into the 4800 yuan level. Money exchange industries and a certain bank released a total of 50 taels to money exchange industries and certain gold shops, for 4770 yuan. Afterwards, foreign exchange softened, money exchange industries, securities firms, and a certain number competed to absorb, and in ten minutes, it also rebounded by 50 yuan. Securities firms bought 50 taels of cash gold from jewelry firms, for 4820 yuan. After this, it stabilized slightly for a while, hovering between 48120 yuan. Around 10:15 AM, the securities firms suddenly came to release again, and the money exchange industry continued to come out on behalf of various parties, supplying more than demand, and the market price became weak again, falling back into the 4800 yuan level. At that time, the exchange market softened again, and there were more sellers, and jewelry firms frequently came to release and sell. Although a certain number of money exchange industries took the opportunity to take in on behalf of customers, they ultimately felt helpless, and it fell by dozens of yuan. Securities firms released 50 taels to the money exchange industry, for 4750 yuan as the noon closing price. After the closing, the situation became even more tired, falling by another 10 yuan, once retreating to 4730 yuan, and then slightly higher to 4740 yuan. In the afternoon, the exchange market continued to harden, and the market situation was weak. Shou Shan and the money exchange industry mutually traded 20 taels, for 4730 yuan. Afterwards, because a certain money exchange industry forcefully sold, it fell by another 30 yuan. A certain money exchange industry released 50 taels to five gold shops, for 4700 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop and securities firms bought on behalf of customers again, and retail investors also followed suit to absorb, so it was raised by 70 yuan. A certain gold shop bought 50 taels from a certain bank, for 4770 yuan. Then, another securities firm suddenly released on behalf of its own firm, and there was no appetite from customers, so it decreased by another 45 yuan.

### Stock Speculation: Still Feverish

Rubber Stock Trading Quiet

Xin An Jun Strongly Advocates Rising

Since the fever of stock speculation, the newspaper has received a letter from Xin Wei Jun, strongly advocating the advantages and disadvantages, and giving a head-on warning to speculators (see this newspaper on the 13th of this month). This was followed by a contribution from Jian Ying Jun to create resonance (see this newspaper on the 15th of this month). Readers will have a fair opinion on how the two gentlemen's opinions and the reasons and their influence. If there is no opening of Hongkou to increase assistance to speculators, various foreign stocks will be as quiet as rubber stocks. Yesterday, another manuscript was received from Xin An Jun, strongly advocating that the rise of rubber stocks is still the beginning, and the future seems to be unlimited. However, the reason why this newspaper can gain the trust of readers is because it is unbiased and impartial, and the position is fair, and the village materials are selected from an objective aspect to contribute to readers, so that readers can use their intelligence and knowledge to make judgments on both positive and negative aspects. Therefore, since Xin Wei Jun's reason for "Wei" has been disclosed, Xin An Jun's reason for "An" should also be shared with readers, and readers will be able to clearly distinguish between right and wrong. It is said that speculation cannot be compared with investment. The current use of stocks for speculation is not for investment, and the result of crazy price increases and hard support will inevitably show one day.

Xin An Jun's full text is very long, and due to the limitation of the length of the article, only key points can be disclosed. His reasons are that "(1) All commodities are seeing daily price increases. Although stocks themselves are not commodities, their nature represents the assets of a company (including movable and immovable property, products, raw materials, and inventory). There is no reason why all commodities should rise, but stocks alone should not rise. The purchasing power of the legal tender is now three-quarters lower than before August 13, and the value of various stocks and grains has only increased by three or four times. This is not an increase in the stock itself, but only a slight benefit to the value of the exchange of the legal tender. (2) Before the outbreak of the European war in September of last year, the price of raw rubber was only one jiao per pound in Singapore currency. Recently, the selling price per pound has reached 3.8 Singapore dollars. Due to the good market prices, most rubber companies have already thrown out their products at this price for futures, and some have also thrown out to the September period of this year. Their production costs have not increased, and the value of the goods has increased by more than two times. Therefore, some people predict that the dividends issued by various rubber companies in 1940 will be at least twice as much as those issued last year, and the value of the stock should naturally also increase by one time. Furthermore, the exchange rate from Singapore currency to Shanghai, converted into legal tender, was previously 1.5 yuan in legal tender per Singapore dollar, and is now 6.5 yuan in legal tender, an increase of more than four times compared to before. According to this calculation, those who previously issued a dividend of 1 jiao per share can issue a dividend of 2 jiao due to the company's profits of two times, and can get more than four times due to the exchange rate relationship of the legal tender. (3) In the past, Shanghai people used rubber stocks as a speculation object. After the end of the First European War in 1918, rubber stocks once plummeted, and there were many bankruptcies. Because of the serious lessons learned, they were quite cautious about investing in rubber stocks. Now the situation is slightly different. The decline in the rubber stock above was due to the fact that the price of rubber during the war was too high, the production was too much, and the demand was drastically reduced after the war. The British government suddenly ordered restrictions on planting due to overproduction, so the business of various companies was immediately suspended. This time, the war has restarted, and although the demand for rubber has increased sharply again, the British government has only relaxed the rubber production from 65% to 80%, and has not reached the extreme, so there is no excess. And during the First European War, the selling price of rubber was more than 3 shillings per pound. This time, the selling price of rubber has only risen to more than 1 shilling."

Yesterday, the stock market of Zhongye Company had an unprecedented rise. The industrial stocks mostly found new highs. There were many sellers who continued to sell, but they still closed at the highest peak. The most noteworthy ones were Shanghai Yin Company, British United Shipyard (that is, the new shares issued after the merger of Yesson and Ruiyong companies), Public Bus, Steel Industry, Xiangtai Timber, and Ewo Cotton Mill. Rubber stocks were slightly quiet due to the large-scale activity of industrial stocks, and only turned firm slightly until the closing.

### Grains: Foreign Rice Arrives Again; More Than 35,000 Bags of Rice Prices Decreased Slightly Again Yesterday

After the rice market grain rebounded, people's hearts were already empty. Regardless of the thickness of the local source of glutinous rice, such as the Kunshan Qingjiao area, those transferred from Hongkou were quite numerous, with 45,000 bags, causing the general passengers to dare not rush in again. The hoarders are even planning to return. For a time, passengers and return goods flooded, and the plan of selling cheap rice will be implemented soon, and the authorities in the settlement have expressed their sanctions, so many floating households are empty-hearted and return, and the market is full of selling air. Xiaojiao opened at 55 yuan and 7 jiao, and then continued to be small 1 jiao, and the market of each goods decreased step by step. If No. 1 Saigon closed at 49 yuan and 8 jiao, No. 2 at 48 yuan, new at 47 yuan and 2 jiao, Huowen around 48 yuan, Tokyo at 434 yuan, broken rice high at 38 yuan, and at 36 yuan, Xiaojiao 46 yuan, Dajiao 45 yuan, next to 423 yuan. Compared with the market yesterday, it also fell 67 jiao or so. Other white yuan sales were sluggish, and it was estimated that it was worth a few yuan. Liyang special yuan was sold for 46 yuan, Danyang goods were 4114 yuan, Hong Kong white yuan was 445 yuan, Tokyo white yuan was 42 yuan and a half, and 42 yuan. As for thin glutinous rice and other national rice, there is no official market price, and they mostly belong to the black market transaction. At this time of fatigue, how can they be unique? Sales are also turning sluggish, and prices have depreciated by about 1 yuan. It is said that Kunxi glutinous rice sells for 54 yuan, and Qingsi thin rice is 512 yuan.

The city's rice prices continue to soar, but the source of foreign rice is unusually surging. The day before yesterday (Sunday), Jardine Matheson's Ming Sheng wheel brought 15,638 bags from Hong Kong. The company's Ding Sheng wheel also arrived in Shanghai on the same day, also bringing 7,070 bags from Hong Kong. Also, Swire Company's Jiangsu wheel also arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (19th), transporting 7,694 bags from Haiphong, and 4,944 bags from Hong Kong. The day before yesterday, a total of 35,346 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. (Ancestor)

### Level Price Reduction

Fufeng Supplies Two-Thirds

Fuxin Supplies One-Third

The flour market yesterday showed a slight easing, due to the Fuxin and Fufeng factories accepting the authorities' advice to openly sell at reduced prices. Starting yesterday, 27 flour shops within the two concessions were designated to be responsible for selling at reduced prices for one month. The Fufeng factory provides a larger quantity, supplying 5,000 bags of Lao Che Pai flour daily, and the Fuxin factory supplies 2,500 bags of Fuxin brand flour. All shops uniformly retail at ten dollars and thirty cents. Thus, the factories' commitment to maintaining the people's livelihood has been publicly demonstrated. With a designated allocation of 7,500 bags to this street, other transactions have naturally quieted down. The factories still restrict sales to outside customers, and demand from outside customers is also weak. Recycled goods are expensive, and new囤户 have become less eager. Those holding orders are not hoarding as much as they were in the previous two days. It is said that the current selling price of Che Chuan Pai warehouse receipts is still sixteen to fifteen dollars and fifty cents. Today, 32,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Tianjin.

The wheat market yesterday reverted to a state of stagnation, due to prices increasing daily after opening at twenty-seven dollars and fifty cents at the end of last week. Factories are trying to suppress prices for procurement, resulting in no transactions.

### Shantou Honey Oranges

Over Six Thousand Six Hundred Pieces Arrive

Shantou honey oranges were quite expensive at the end of the year, but prices have gradually stabilized since the New Year. It is said that the price at the origin is quite low, but they must be shipped via Hong Kong and then to Shanghai. Moreover, on-the-spot exorbitant taxes and levies are no less than the conditions in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. As a result, the supply is slightly scarce, and orange prices are relatively high. However, yesterday 6,683 pieces of honey oranges arrived, and the people of Shanghai can once again enjoy a feast.

### Yarn and Cotton Flower - 空戶 Movement - Yarn Prices Continue to Drop

The yarn market continues to decline, and the situation has softened again. This is due to the relaxation of foreign exchange, with many bears settling their positions. At the same time, short sellers have returned to increase their positions, leading to a lack of confidence and a weakening of the market. Buyers are scarce. In fact, the previous surge was too violent, and the reaction is naturally strong. However, the recent changes have been rapid, and the future lacks certainty. Nonetheless, large players are still inclined to buy.

The spot yarn market opened this morning with news of a loosening of foreign exchange, but buyers were scarce. Bulls were actively selling, and there was a loosening of chips in the market. Those who were scalping were again inclined to sell, causing temporary confusion in the market. Twenty-count Double Horse yarn opened at 842 yuan, but immediately fell to 828 yuan. Later, major players in the industry returned to buy, and the price gradually rose back to 834 yuan, closing unchanged. The total trading volume for half a day was 2,025 bales. The price of twenty-count Double Horse yarn fell by 11 yuan. Yesterday, 135 pieces of yarn were shipped to Tianjin, and today 140 pieces were shipped. The breakdown of the quantities bought by various groups is as follows:

Fellow Traders 2,020 Domestic 5

Total 2,025

### Cotton Prices Diverge from Yarn - Yao Yi Continues to Arrive at Port

The cotton trade is slightly dull, but although the yarn market continues to decline, the price of thick cotton, which is closely related, has not been affected. Tongzhou cotton is still selling for 201 to 203 yuan. According to industry insiders, those holding goods are still reluctant to sell much, due to the low cotton inventory. Therefore, the yarn and cotton markets are moving in opposite directions. There were 817 bales of Tonghua cotton from northern Jiangsu. The current cotton situation is listed below:

American firm Hengyang 行 purchased a large amount of Hua 棉 in Zhejiang, and two batches have already been shipped. Yesterday, a third batch of 8,995 bales also arrived in Shanghai, transported by the Taikoo Shipping Company's Chengdu轮. It arrived at the port yesterday morning and is docked at the company's wharf in the French Concession. Unloading is scheduled to begin today. (Year)

Another report on foreign cotton prices: The New York cotton market was relatively quiet at the beginning, but later, due to the strength of Wall Street stock prices and short covering, the market closed stable, up two to four pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell slightly by one or two rupees. The Egyptian market was closed.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trade was again dull yesterday due to the weakness of yarn prices, and industry sentiment was relatively weak. Therefore, market trading was quite quiet. Factories showed little interest in purchasing. No large transactions by Japanese manufacturers have been heard of. The following are the factory delivery prices converted from the US dollar exchange rate of 6.9375 yuan yesterday:

20 Count American Mitterling 265.9

Also Subgrade Five Three 153.00

32 Count Also 270.20

Also Subgrade 262.00

42 Count Also 283.20

Also Subgrade 270.00

### Oil Market - Raw Soybean Oil - Plunges Five or Six Yuan

Yesterday, sentiment in the oil market was affected by the decline in gold prices and sluggish sales. Buyers retreated, and the bullish market created by manipulators collapsed. General囤户 are eager to sell, and are cutting prices to attract buyers. As a result, soybean oil prices plunged by six yuan, and peanut oil also fell by five yuan. A total of 120 barrels of Dalian crude oil were traded at 117 yuan, with delivery in two or three days, but were only offered at 115 yuan. There were 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil at 81 yuan, 300 pieces of Qingqi oil at 83 yuan, 40 barrels of Bengbu oil at 113 yuan, and 30 barrels of Qingdao peanut oil at 120 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains - Soybeans Show Signs of Instability

Yesterday, the soybean market was supported by囤户, but there was a lack of actual buyers, and trading volume decreased sharply. Only one transaction of 500 bags of Jia Zhou soybeans was made at 29.7 to 30 yuan, and 600 bags of Chongming 沙黄 soybeans were traded at 28.8 to 29 yuan. Therefore, the market has already declined slightly, and the overall market sentiment may become looser.

### Piece Goods - The Cloth Market Turns Sharply - The Outlets for Nanyang Restrictions on Importation are Gradually Decreasing

The cotton cloth market has been surging recently due to speculative manipulation, but actual sales are sluggish. Yesterday, with the sharp drop in gold prices, cloth market囤户 are eager to sell, and the market has suddenly turned downward. However, buyers are scarce. Prices for bleached and dyed cloth are stagnant, and hidden discounts are common. White goods, fine cloth, twill, and coarse cloth have fallen by 2.5 to 5 jiao per piece. Around 100 cases of bleached and dyed printed cloth were traded in this street. The Guangdong and Hong Kong帮 are better, trading more than 200 pieces of material patterned, color cloth, and printed cloth. The Zhejiang Dongjian 台帮 traded nearly 100 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and twill. The Beilu Yan Jin帮 traded more than 2,000 pieces of blue cloth, silk poplin, and printed cloth. Due to strict restrictions on imports from Nanyang, outbound shipments are gradually decreasing. On the 19th, 480 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Tianjin, on the 20th, 400 pieces were shipped to Yantai, and 66 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.

### Coal - White Coal Frequently Rises

White coal prices are frequently rising due to strong demand from street customers. Buyers, with limited inventory, are hoarding and raising prices, leading to market chaos and inconsistent prices. Yitai Xing Hongji white coal is priced at 160 yuan per ton, and small pieces at 155 yuan, with few transactions. Nanyang disk prices have increased by 20 yuan per ton. Fellow traders limit sales to warehouse receipts and spot cars. Therefore, the shops on this street are all raising prices significantly. Hongji screened lumps are priced at 200 yuan per ton, and small pieces at 190 yuan, delivered to customers' homes, including handling fees.

### Silk and Tea - Chinese and Foreign Silk Markets Turn Stable

The New York silk market is sluggish. Goubin current silk is 1,750 yuan, near-term is 751 yuan, and long-term is 1,667 yuan. Spot prices are up about 70 yuan from Saturday, and long-term prices are up 18 yuan. The afternoon closing price for spot is 1,740 yuan, near-term is 1,739 yuan, and long-term is 1,659 yuan, slightly lower.

The local silk market is quite stable. White factory B grade is 5,000 yuan, and there are continuous follow-up orders, with Dachang and Yihe each trading 20 dan. Reeling silk is 1,800 yuan, unchanged. User silk factories have gradually become active since yesterday. White factory B grade is 4,800 to 5,000 yuan, and 10 dan were traded yesterday. Therefore, the general trend is that silk prices have become stable.

### Sugar Market - 600 Tons of Crude White Opened

Yesterday, Tianxiang opened 300 tons of Dutch crude white at a price of 6.20 Dutch盾. Taikoo opened 300 tons at a price of 6.275 Dutch盾. The Dutch盾 has indeed declined, so the association's disk is weak. Spot price for 124 crude white is half to 1.2 yuan. The local warehouse price is 62 yuan, and the newly arrived foreign warehouse price is 62.7 to 63 yuan. The old goods are 61.5 to 62 yuan, and the transshipment goods are 49 yuan, Xiaoeryuan.

### Juvenile Court

— Huang Jiayin

According to reliable reports, since August 13th, juvenile crime cases in Shanghai have increased by 30% (in direct proportion to the soaring prices!). These crimes do not occur because these children are born with criminal tendencies, but because of the pressure of hunger and poverty.

They don't have the habit of not committing crimes. They don't know what safety is. Only the speed of their legs and the alertness of their eyes can make them safe. They don't think charity organizations are very reasonable, because philanthropists don't help them actively fight for life.

In the court records, you can see that a sixteen-year-old child has committed six cases. What can we, the lucky ones in this society, say about this fact?

It is meaningless to convict and imprison these children, and it will not solve the problem. We must learn from European and American countries, create a juvenile court, and have judges who understand child psychology to hear these cases. We must also investigate the root causes of these children's crimes and provide practical assistance according to their individual needs.

To effectively solve the problem of juvenile crime, we must have a juvenile court.

### Children's Club

— Cao Qianyou

In Shanghai, the number of children wandering on the streets is truly countless. These innocent and lively children have lost the care of their parents at a young age and wandered onto the streets, without good food or warm clothing. They can be considered extremely miserable. Furthermore, without anyone to guide and educate them and put them on the right track, they are like lost lambs. For the sake of food and clothing, they often commit various criminal acts, such as theft. If they are small thieves today, they will be big robbers tomorrow. If people in society do not find a way to save them, these children can be said to be the gangsters of tomorrow's society. Recently, the US government, seeing this situation, established the "American Children's Club" in New York City.

The American Children's Club is run by a criminologist named Peizizhe. Mr. Peizizhe is already fifty-five years old. From his long experience in managing prisons, he came to a conclusion about the problem of crime: "Prisons cannot cure crime. The best prisons can only turn half of the people in prison into good citizens. The best way to reduce the occurrence of crime is to save some homeless children. A child's future good or bad is based on what they do in their spare time.

For the above reasons, this "Children's Club" was founded. All the facilities are designed to cater to the psychology of children, such as gymnasiums, swimming pools, art rooms, and shops. In this way, children have the most suitable place to play and relax in their spare time.

I hope that in the near future, a "Children's Club" like this will also be established in Shanghai to accommodate a group of homeless children, teach and train them, and use their strength to do various things that are beneficial to society. In this way, society will increase good citizens, and the country will increase useful talents.

### My Confession

— Pu Ming

If a prophet had told me ten years ago: Your life will be ordinary. Perhaps from childhood to now, I would not have made so many beautiful dreams.

Four or five years ago, sitting in the last row of the classroom, the teacher's explanations never interested me. New nouns were regarded as dung, and I looked up at the sky outside the window all day long, yearning for many bizarre stories.

Life gradually became monotonous, only my reverie was like a torrent of flowing water. I thought of things beyond this world, and sought only in the mysterious.

I didn't like people calling my name, I didn't want them to know me, I looked at the world with half-closed eyes, only loneliness comforted me, and my singing became obscure and stiff!

So, I became a superman. I didn't talk much, I only loved to meditate quietly. Seeing the joy of others, I felt disgusted. I ridiculed them as low-level pleasures, and I thought that everything beautiful in the world was worthless.

I was also unwilling to listen to others' complaints and cries. I said that this was their own fault, the result of their deep involvement in society.

Turning everything around me into insignificance, I was tirelessly searching for a non-existent world.

In a few years, I walked alone, but the waves of life gave me unexpected blows, turning my delusions into light smoke.

Because I tasted some bitterness, I returned to this world.

Now, I listen to the words of a poet, I want to walk through the cities scattered with filth and corruption and the countryside that no footprints reach, and no longer look at the sky or the walls with a melancholy tilt of my neck to dream. What I want to care about are the affairs of the world.

### Self-Heating Cans

— Boyan

Carl Laemmle, a pioneer of the American film industry, once met a German exile named Leo Katz in Switzerland. He invented a method of steaming canned food. He put an ordinary can of food in a larger can, and put some chemicals in the interlayer between the two cans. When you want to eat it, make a few small holes in the can, and these chemicals will react and generate heat, steaming the canned food inside.

### Colonel House and the First European War

— Li Shaozhong

US President Roosevelt recently sent Under Secretary of State Welles to Europe as the President's personal representative, which has attracted close attention from authorities in all countries around the world. Many commentators in various countries compare Welles's trip to the trip of the late US President Wilson's Colonel House to Europe during the last European War. However, the result of Colonel House's engagement in Europe at that time not only failed to restore peace, but also dragged the United States into the war. What the result of Welles's trip to Europe will be is certainly also worth paying attention to. Now let us introduce Colonel House to the readers.

Colonel House was born on July 26, 1858, in Houston, Texas, in the southern United States. His father had been from England since he was a child, and later participated in the "independence" revolution in which Texas seceded from Mexico and merged into the United States, making considerable contributions. Colonel House received a good education from an early age and graduated from the famous American university "Cornell University" in 1879. He returned to his hometown of Texas the following year. Since then, he lived in Texas for more than 30 years, working in farming. But his main interest was still in public affairs. Between 1894 and 1904, he held great political influence in Texas. However, he consistently refused to formally step onto the political stage himself, so he never ran for office. He preferred to be a close advisor to the state authorities while remaining in the opposition.

In 1912, he worked very hard in the movement to recommend Wilson as a presidential candidate. Wilson was eventually elected, and he deserves a lot of credit for this. Therefore, when Wilson came to power, he asked him to choose any position in the cabinet himself, but he still maintained his consistent style and refused to accept any official title. However, his relationship with President Wilson, whether politically or personally, was far beyond that of any cabinet minister. Even when the President chose cabinet members, a large part of it was based on Colonel House's recommendation. Furthermore, when the President and cabinet members encountered legislative or administrative difficulties, they often sought instruction from House, because Colonel House not only had a lot of experience with people, but also often had unique and insightful opinions on the implementation of politics. President Wilson said that House was his "Independent self."

House had a great interest in diplomacy. Because he was often close to American ambassadors abroad and often close to major European politicians, and because President Wilson trusted him, he had a significant influence on the direction of US foreign policy decisions.

In the spring of 1924, before the outbreak of the First European War, he knew the serious danger of the European situation and specially set off for Europe to make suggestions to Britain and Germany, expressing that the United States was willing to work hard to adjust the relationship between Britain and Germany to avoid war. He held talks with senior German officials in Berlin and also held a meeting with the German Emperor. Later, William II said: "Colonel House's visits to Berlin and London could have prevented this World War from happening."

After returning to the United States from Europe, Colonel House maintained close contact with the ambassadors of Britain and Germany, which made the relationship between the United States and both belligerent countries in Europe very harmonious in the early stages of the European War. In January 1915, President Wilson sent him to Europe as the President's personal representative to conduct on-the-spot research on the question of whether the United States could mediate the war under the current situation. After visiting London, Berlin, and Paris, Colonel House suggested using the principle of "freedom of the seas" as the first step in a compromise; however, the sinking of the "Lusitania" shattered all hopes of success. The following year, Colonel House was sent to Europe again to make a final effort for peace in Europe. However, despite his excellent political skills and the strong national power behind him, Colonel House's "bitter heart" and earnest advice ultimately failed to save the European situation from collapse, and the United States itself could not avoid being dragged into the vortex of the Great War.

### The Wives of German Dignitaries

— Lu Degang

It is said that Germans treat their wives with more respect than any other country. Gentlemen invariably protect their wives. This is something that Germans often pride themselves on.

Therefore, since the outbreak of the European War, Air Minister General Göring has asked his wife to go to Switzerland to recuperate from illness. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's wife also went to Brazil for a long voyage at her husband's request. Propaganda Minister Goebbels' wife and Mrs. Neues also ran to Switzerland to become expatriates. The wife of German secret police chief Himmler had been traveling and playing in Italy before the war. It is said that she has a strong interest in traveling, so she does not intend to return immediately.

These wives of German dignitaries are all enjoying themselves abroad. Naturally, they enjoy the special privileges of respect and protection that their husbands give them. It is a pity that most German women not only do not enjoy this blessing, but also suffer the infinite pain caused by the war created by Führer Hitler!

### A Generation of 红伶 - Fragrant 消玉殒 - Zhang Weny艷's Various Aspects

— Bingjiu

Zhang Weny艷 was the most famous among the early female actors in the South. More than 20 years ago, she was very famous. Enthusiasts crowned her as Prince Weny艷, as the foremost female lead. After marrying Yuan, she stopped singing, lived in seclusion, and rarely interacted with the outside world. Time flies, 20 years in a blink of an eye. Last winter, she suddenly suffered from kidney disease, lingered in bed for several months, medicine was ineffective, doctors were helpless. She finally passed away on Lunar New Year's Eve, at the age of only 42. A generation of artists passed away, looking back on the past, I feel even more emotional. Therefore, based on what I know, I write this to tell those who care about the opera.

Family Background

Weny艷 was from Zhenjiang. Her father's name was Zhang Xiqing, a tailor. His family was poor and could not support themselves. A friend who was learning to be an actor persuaded his daughter to enter the opera. Zhang was in trouble at that time, and the discussion was successful. Weny艷 had an older sister named Wen Kui, who was four or five years older than Weny艷. She graduated early and became famous in the opera. When Weny艷 first came on stage, her acting skills were immature. People thought she was too simple and natural, cute and interesting, so they loved her with the same heart as they loved Wen Kui. The two singers were like nightingales, and I don't know how many children of noble families were fascinated. Before long, Wen Kui was appreciated by a Mr. Ruan, who rewarded her with a lot of money and hid her in a golden house. Mr. Ruan was a giant in the egg business, with tens of thousands of assets. After marrying Wen Kui, his family fortunes suddenly declined. Wen Kui was calm and worried, and did all the housework herself, just like a good family woman. The following year, Wen Kui died of illness. Weny艷 cried bitterly, which made her even more motivated to work hard on her career. She enjoyed her fame for seven or eight years without declining. Later, she was hired by Mr. Yuan, and then she stopped singing. Her younger brother, Zhang Baiyun, is currently a screenwriter at the Great Theater, and he is also a talented person in the opera world.

Artistic Achievements

Weny艷 was a skilled in the role of 花旦, and her acting was unrestrained and thorough. Although she was not exceptionally beautiful, she was radiant and energetic when she was dressed up on stage, and she was exceptionally charming. She seemed drunk, her voice was soft, but her inner strength was weak. She was good at small movements and eye expressions. Her performances in "Wandering Lake Boat", "Spinning Cotton", "Playing Flowers", and "Checking Touguan" were full of flirtatious sounds and delicate cries. The audience was fascinated by her great magic, and those who supported her gave her the title of prince, as if she was a lover of music.

— Bingbing

Large-Scale Production of All Dream of the Red Chamber Films

Will Hold Public Exhibition After Completion

In the autumn of the year before last, Xinhua Company transformed its film studio, Lilac Garden, into a model of West Lake and held a "West Lake Expo": At that time, it caused a sensation among many tourists who came to watch the "West Lake" scenery. Recently, under the planning of Zhang Shankun, there is another large-scale reconstruction of the "Grand View Garden", which will be held soon during the spring season.

The various scenes described in the novel Dream of the Red Chamber are something that most people have "yearned for" for a long time. Xinhua has now decided to invest 100,000 yuan to mobilize all the set designers to build the garden, which covers dozens of acres, on a large scale according to the Dream of the Red Chamber atlas. All kinds of scenery such as pavilions and towers in the Red Mansion are all available here, and everything is complete.

The motive for this plan is to prepare to gather talents and produce a complete series of long-length ancient costume films of Dream of the Red Chamber on a large scale. Therefore, it has been decided to give Xianghua Country a coat of ancient costumes, and all the sets will be built, so that the Red Mansion movie can be held as a "West Lake Expo". Public exhibition of "Grand View Garden".

The characters in Dream of the Red Chamber, from the Twelve Beauties down, are unusually large in number, both male and female, and it is originally a difficult to produce blockbuster. In addition to signing Chen Yun裳, Cheng君, Yuan Meiyun, Chen Yanyan...... and other outstanding talents to participate, Xinhua will also make full details in other aspects; therefore, the garden is gorgeous, different from ordinary, and will release an absolutely great difference under the current prevalence of ancient costume films.

Now, the "Grand View Garden" has been drawn and designed by experts, and construction will begin on a large scale in the shortest possible time; because it is limited to the late spring period, it must be fully completed and a public exhibition will be held.

### Thoughts After Seeing a Qi School Opera Performance (Part 1)

— Su Shaoqing

It's been several years since I last saw Zhou Zhifang, the leader of the Qi school, perform. A few days ago, Mr. Jin invited me to the Carlton to see him perform "The Honest Official's Register." After buying the ticket and settling down, the play "Bumping the Tablet" was already being performed on stage. Gao Baisui played Yang Linggong, his voice was very broad and bright, but his singing style was not very delicate. After a few minutes of intermission, the performance resumed. Zhou Xinfang, playing Kou Zhun, came on stage, speaking in a rough voice. Xinfang wore a gauze hat and an official's robe, his attire was extremely proper. Furthermore, he had skill in his legs; the way he walked casually was pleasing to the eye, truly different from the others. When he was transferred to the capital and lived in the official residence, he sang the "Five Watches" very loudly, with a tune that was not low, reaching the proper key. It was a pity that whenever he reached a high note, he inevitably exerted himself and had the problem of swallowing tones and omitting words. (Singers whose voices are not high enough, stop singing when they encounter a high note, and resume singing when they reach a low note, which is called "eating words.") Because of his old reputation, people forgave him and showed no dissatisfaction at all. Fortunately, the people who came to the Carlton to see the Yifeng Drama Society were focused on watching and not listening, so a few small flaws in the singing were not a problem at all. That aside, Xinfang's acting definitely had its own characteristics. For example, in the scene where the Eight Thousand Year Old Bestows a Horse, except for the line he sang while kneeling on the ground, which was long and slow and did not sound good at all, all the other acting expressions were delicate and subtle. When he laughed triumphantly, he was scolded by the eunuch, and he suddenly showed a look of shock and fear, shrinking his head down and holding the horsewhip behind his back. This one gesture can be described as a stroke of genius.
