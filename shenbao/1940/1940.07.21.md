A Certain Location in Eastern Zhejiang: The war situation in the coastal area of Zhenhai has taken a sharp turn. The Chinese army, dividing its forces to implement a resolute counterattack, advances bravely and irresistibly. Consequently, the strongholds of Laoshu Mountain, Xiaogang, Sigushan, Jiangnanshi, Yaqian, and others have all been successively captured by the Chinese army. The two forts of Zhenyuan and Hongyuan in Zhenhai are also under intense siege by the Chinese army. On the afternoon of the 19th, at 4 p.m., the Zhendai Fort was captured, annihilating a large number of Japanese troops. The remaining Japanese forces in Hongyuan Fort will soon be completely eliminated by the Chinese army. Furthermore, the Chinese army is encircling and attacking Zhenhai City, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese troops. A major fire has now broken out within Zhenhai City, with flames reaching the sky. The Chinese army is intensifying its attack. (19th Dispatch)

The Chinese army killed many Japanese soldiers. Fierce battles are still ongoing in the vicinity of Xiaogang Town.

The Japanese army landing on the southern bank of Hangzhou Bay has already occupied Zhenhai, the gateway to Ningbo. In the past two days, the Japanese army has also urgently undertaken landing operations in Xiangshan Port and Quanzhou Port. When the Japanese army attempts to land, they are assisted by Japanese aircraft, while in the Quanzhou Port area, Japanese naval artillery heavily bombards the land to cover the Japanese army's landing. The Japanese navy participating in the operation includes one aircraft carrier, one cruiser, one destroyer, and eight other warships. (20th United Press Dispatch)

### Embargo on Goods on the Yunnan-Burma Road Commences Yesterday, Most Munitions Had Already Been Moved, Only a Few Remain

Rangoon: A special gazette of Burma, published today, officially prohibits the transport to China of goods specified in the Anglo-Japanese agreement. According to a dispatch from Shiu, large convoys of Chinese trucks, anticipating the imminent cessation of traffic, are rushing to the Chinese border, hoping to cross into Chinese territory by midnight.

America is Willing to Continue Talks on Abolishing Extraterritoriality

Washington: Acting Secretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the United States is willing to continue negotiations on abolishing extraterritoriality in China when China restores peace. Welles said that negotiations on abolishing extraterritoriality in China were in progress but stopped due to the outbreak of war. Under this right, American citizens in China are not governed by Chinese law but only by the laws formulated by the administrative authorities of the concessions. (20th United Press Dispatch)

Washington: Recently, the Washington "Star" published an article advising the American people to criticize Britain's yielding to Japan's demand to block the Burma Road. The newspaper stated that when Britain is at war with Germany and seeks no worries in the rear, it is unfair for others to criticize Britain's actions that it deems appropriate and to reluctantly comply with Japan's demands. Regardless of the actions taken by Downing Street (British Prime Minister's residence), US Secretary of State Hull clearly declared that the United States will not retreat in the Far East. Hull's attitude is noteworthy because Japan is loudly calling for a more aggressive policy toward the United States. (20th United Press Dispatch)

Chongqing: The son of a former Chinese government advisor, Duke University Assistant Professor Lin Bakier, said last night to over a thousand Chinese intellectuals that the closure of the Burma Road, from the American perspective, means that China's open-door policy has truly come to an end. After this road is closed, unless consulting with Japan or taking the extremely long route through the Soviet Union, American goods will no longer be able to enter the vast Chinese market.

General Catroux Issues Farewell Address

Hanoi: French Indochina Governor-General General Catroux issued a farewell address today, stating, "I have been ordered by the government to transfer my duties to the newly appointed Admiral Decoux tomorrow. I bid farewell to my French compatriots and the people of Vietnam. Although I am leaving office, I have a clear conscience. During my tenure, I have strived to fulfill my responsibilities, protecting our nation's land, currency, honor, and flag, and enabling you to live and work in peace. As for foreign affairs, I have not only maintained existing friendly relations but have also enhanced them. Thus, peace has been maintained both internally and externally. I firmly believe that promoting this policy is not only understandable to neighboring countries but also maintains our country's reputation in the Far East." (20th Havas Agency Dispatch)

Japanese Newspapers Comment on Churchill's Speech

Hong Kong Tokyo Dispatch: The "Mainichi Shimbun" commented on Churchill's speech, stating that the British Prime Minister indicated that Britain is willing to abolish (extraterritoriality), unequal treaties, return concessions in China, and mediate the Sino-Japanese war. Regardless of Britain's motives, it at least indicates that Britain's Far East policy has undergone a major change. Unfortunately, Britain's expression came too late and was not proposed twelve months ago. It seems that Churchill did not consult with the United States and the Soviet Union on the peace proposal in advance. This move only serves to indicate Britain's difficult situation. The "Asahi Shimbun" believes that under the current circumstances, Britain cannot but close the Burma and Hong Kong routes. After the Anglo-Japanese compromise, it is questionable what policy the Chongqing government will adopt. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" speculates that Britain's mediation of the Sino-Japanese incident is due to the following motives: (1) Preventing Japan from further leaning towards the Axis powers; (2) Preventing Britain from making further concessions in the Far East; (3) Protecting the Chongqing government and befriending the United States.

### National Government Invests 300 Million Yuan in Sichuan Province

Chongqing: According to an official announcement today regarding the Sichuan Province Productivity Survey, the National Government has invested 300 million yuan in various private industries in Sichuan Province over the past three years. The survey of China's ability to meet wartime needs has found that China does not lack sources of industrial strength, as the estimated coal reserves in Sichuan Province are 900 billion tons, and the maximum possible hydroelectric power is 20 million horsepower, which can be developed along many inland rapid rivers. In the past three years, financial convenience in Sichuan Province has made significant progress. Government banks have established 250 branches throughout the province. There are many types of industrial products, especially progress has been made in textile production, and cotton cultivation has also developed quite well. The survey also briefly mentions the various difficulties arising from the current situation, stating that although Sichuan has a population of about 50 million, the current manpower is quite exhausted for various transportation projects and military service. Refugees from various places coming to Sichuan Province are of no help in solving the labor problem, as they mostly belong to the middle class and are not accustomed to manual labor. However, the proper utilization of the disaster-stricken laborers will alleviate this difficult problem. The survey also stated that although Sichuan Province's iron reserves are only 63 million tons, what is noteworthy is that this amount has not yet been developed. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

### Hong Kong Bans Tea Exports, All Exports Are Prohibited Except for Those with Special Permits, This Ban is a Concession to Japan

Hong Kong: Hong Kong has recently banned tea exports. All tea leaves are prohibited from being exported, except for those with special permits. This ban is generally considered to be another concession to Japan, as the Sino-Soviet trade agreement stipulates that the Soviet Union will supply China with military supplies, and China will allow the Soviet Union to monopolize the export of tea, which is transported through Hong Kong.

This statement was issued after the two sides met to address issues of mutual interest.

Editorial

### Germany Offers Britain Peace

German leader Adolf Hitler made a speech to his country's parliament the night before last, in which he said, "My conscience compels me to appeal to Britain again, it is useless to continue the war;" and "If the British ignore this again, tragedy will surely come." In addition, he reiterated the loyalty and bravery of the German military and people, the close alliance between Germany and Italy, and the stability of Soviet-German relations; and while criticizing Britain for expanding the scope of the European war, he stated that one of the tenets of the German National Socialist Party's program is to "demand the revision of the Treaty of Versailles by possible peaceful means;" and he stated that Hitler's foreign policy of seeking peace is to "obtain the friendship of Italy and the understanding of Britain, in order to promote world cooperation." Regardless of what the consequences of this speech may be, it is certainly an important event in the European war.

Before discussing this further, let us first state two points clearly: First, according to the summary of the speech transmitted last night, Hitler suggested peace, but he did not mention the United States at all, which is implicitly an important factor in world peace; and he did not pay attention to the clamorous political tide in Tokyo, which called for strengthening the Axis relationship between Germany and Italy. Second, according to the London dispatch last night, British officials refused to criticize this speech; some said that Britain has the determination to resist the war and is prepared for all eventualities; however, it is presumed that the British authorities will not "ignore this again" and respond with silent preparation for war, right? How to respond will not only be a great debate worthy of the situation, but also what the future of the European situation hinges upon, so please wait and see.

The outbreak of this European war was caused by long-standing historical facts, which stimulated and impacted each other: the viewpoints of both sides are different, and the arguments are naturally different; although the right and wrong are left to later historians, it is difficult to reach a conclusion. As it has evolved to the current stage, if we further compare the resources, manpower, strategy, and war preparations of Britain and Germany separately, measure their strengths and weaknesses, and deduce the gains and losses of continuing the war, how it will win or lose? Then, whether it is the warring parties, they will inevitably be driven by emotion and unwilling to show weakness; even those who are outside the situation, or because of their love and hatred, it is difficult to be appropriate; moreover, war is dangerous and the opportunities are various, it is never possible to foresee the results based on figures on paper in advance. Churchill said that the German offensive will inevitably fail; Hitler said that Britain's continued war will inevitably lead to destruction. What the two said can be believed to be based on their own confidence and are not empty talk; however, it is obvious that each is betting the fate of their country, and there will inevitably be one winner and one loser, but who will win and who will lose is unknown. However, on the eve of repeatedly winning battles and attacking Britain, Germany suddenly made an appeal for peace in a posture of pulling back from the brink. Although the spirit and conditions under which peace will be sought, whether it will be harmonious with us, and whether it will be successful with us, there are many questions; if peace fails and it is necessary to resort to war again, then which country should bear the blame and the responsibility is even heavier; however, as far as the current stage is concerned, we cannot but say that the choice of peace or war lies with Britain. Will the British authorities seriously consider the responsibility of this choice?

We have heard Britain's arguments for declaring war on Germany. Based on those arguments, there should be no room for consideration of peace or war; regardless of success or failure, only war is possible. However, is there no room for Britain's arguments to change? Are there not already facts that allow for a change? Hasn't Britain itself already trodden the path of change? Or are Britain's arguments consistent from the beginning? We do not want to list all the events from the Munich Agreement to the Tokyo Agreement and examine them one by one in relation to Britain's arguments for war; we do not want to reiterate that the representatives of the official governments of Belgium and France withdrew from this battlefield, and study whether this caused the arguments to lose their general international nature; listing them, reiterating them, examining them, and studying them only increases pain and stimulation, so it is better to stop. However, in the current stage, Germany has not already won and forced a surrender, and Britain has not already lost and offered terms of submission; therefore, there should be equal peace talks. Since Hitler has said that continuing the war is useless and that he is compelled by his conscience to appeal again, who does not have a heart of compassion? Try to assess his sincerity, it is necessary to approach this with sincerity. Peace talks may break down due to uncoordinated conditions, but Hitler has not yet clearly shown Britain conditions that would be unacceptable; peace talks may be coerced because enemy troops are on the border, but the German army is still overseas from Britain, peace if an agreement can be reached, war if it cannot; so, what is wrong with accepting the proposal to test the conditions? The changes brewing in the international situation are too numerous to prevent; saying that the brewing is beneficial to Britain, we suspect that it is not, and this is especially evident in the Far East. Therefore, if the European war ends before the Far Eastern war, it cannot be said to be a loss for Britain!

### Hitler Makes a Final Plea for Peace to Britain in the Name of "Reason," Threatening Total War If Rejected, Confident That Germany Will Not Be the Destroyer in the End

Berlin – In a special session of the Reichstag yesterday afternoon, Hitler delivered a speech, making a final appeal to Britain in the name of reason and common sense to cease the war that is bound to inflict terrible damage and great sacrifices on both sides. The final section stated, "In a contest between two strong powers, one must perish. Churchill may believe that the one to perish will be Germany, but I know that the one to perish will be Britain. I now feel a responsibility in my conscience to appeal to Britain once more. I am not a defeated supplicant, but a victor speaking in the name of reason, so I may as well make this appeal. I see no reason why this war must continue. I am always saddened by the sacrifices required by any war. I should also avert the scourge of war for my own people. I know that millions of Germans are extremely eager to resolve everything with the enemy who declared war on us twice for no reason, but I also know that many women in the country who are prepared to sacrifice everything are still willing to sacrifice. Churchill may again ignore my words and say that my words are issued out of doubt about his final victory. If that is the case, then I can face the future with a clear conscience. Looking back over the past few months, we have accomplished great things under the protection of God, and we are deeply grateful to God for guiding our determination and giving us guidance in our difficult work. As for myself, I am especially moved that God has entrusted me with the important task of restoring our freedom and glory."

Before Hitler spoke, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano was seated in the front row, and many members of parliament were in military uniform. First, General Göring delivered an opening speech, praising the fallen soldiers and saying that the National Assembly would ensure that the families of the fallen would be spared from hunger and cold. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)

### Full Text of Hitler's Speech

Berlin – Führer Hitler arrived at the Great Hall of the Reichstag at 6:45 PM yesterday and immediately declared the meeting open, with Speaker Göring presiding. First, he led a moment of silence for the fallen soldiers, followed by condolences for the fallen Italian soldiers, especially Air Force Commander General Balbo. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano was seated in the first row of the diplomatic section. Führer Hitler stood up amidst thunderous applause and delivered a speech, first stating the reasons for convening the Reichstag: (1) To show the historical significance of the events people are encountering today; (2) To thank our loyal and brave soldiers; (3) To make a final rational appeal to all parties.

First Statement of the Causes of the War

Hitler forcefully stated that those who have caused this unprecedented conflict in history must recognize that the sacrifices of this conflict are disproportionate to its causes. In other words, unless the causes contain other hidden intentions, they are definitely not worth such great sacrifices. Hitler stated that the National Socialist movement's foreign policy plan was to use peaceful means to revise all the circumstances created by the Treaty of Versailles. The Treaty of Versailles not only sought to humiliate and discriminate against the Germanic people but also sought to destroy this cultured nation. The League of Nations not only failed to become an organ for rational revision of the Treaty of Versailles but also guaranteed its implementation. Therefore, the goals of the National Socialist movement were, in addition to overthrowing the rule of Jewish capitalists internally, to liberate Germany from the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles externally. Over the years, Germany has repeatedly attempted to find peaceful means of revision. When international cooperation was established on September 29, 1938, by the Munich Agreement, and a glimmer of hope appeared in resolving this issue, British and French public opinion clamored, accusing the government of weakness and slandering knowledgeable members of the opposition party as Germany's "Fifth Column." At the same time, international financial magnates believed that war could make their trade prosper, and they stirred up trouble, such as Britain and France inciting Poland to resist. Are the sacrifices they suffered and the results they obtained commensurate with what Germany originally requested? In the end, what Germany proposed was only Danzig and the traffic between Germany and East Prussia. However, Poland, seduced by international warmongers, rejected Germany's direct proposal and engaged in a war of terror. As evidenced by the shocking secret documents of the British and French Supreme Defense Council seized by German soldiers at the Paris station on June 19 this year, it is even more evident that the small countries are merely tools of the British and French military and political leaders. Recalling that before the war broke out, the United States had made a peace appeal, and on October 6, I (Hitler referring to himself) again proposed a peace proposal in the Reichstag, but the British and French authorities brazenly started the war, thinking I was weak. Chamberlain, incited by warmongers such as Churchill, Cooper, and Belisha, publicly vilified me. Therefore, I reorganized the army and strengthened the troops to undertake new tasks."

German Forces Strike First

Hitler mentioned that military action was postponed last winter due to bad weather. It was not until March this year that Germany received intelligence that Britain and France were planning something regarding the Soviet-Finnish War, with the aim of harming Russia rather than assisting Finland, because it was Germany's ally. At that time, Britain and France decided to intervene in the Soviet-Finnish War in order to obtain a base in the Baltic Sea and expand the war to the Balkans and the Near East. At the same time, in order to prevent Germany from obtaining Swedish iron ore, Britain and France planned to attack Sweden. "When I saw that the crisis of Northern Europe being dragged into the war had become unusually clear, I issued orders to the German army. Although Churchill wanted to deploy troops to attack the German navy first, the German army's preemptive strike completely failed. This campaign is the most courageous achievement in German military history, thanks to the dedicated efforts of the officers and soldiers of the navy, army, and air force.

Victory on the Western Front Strategy

Hitler continued by mentioning the war on the Western Front, stating that before the Norwegian war had ended, the French army had begun to move to the French-Belgian border. After holding staff talks with Belgium and the Netherlands, British and French troops had a tendency to attack German industrial areas. I then instructed the navy, army, and air force to make all necessary preparations. On May 6th and 7th, multiple calls were made between London and Paris, showing that the "Allied Powers" had the possibility of attacking Belgium and the Netherlands at any time. Therefore, on May 8th, I ordered the German army to begin the attack at dawn on the 10th. This time, my strategy was different from the Schlieffen Plan of 1914, focusing on the left wing and adopting an encirclement tactic against the large French army densely deployed in Belgium and the Netherlands. My plan proceeded smoothly. Hitler detailed the war in France and Belgium until Pétain begged for surrender, forcefully stating that the air force was effective due to the skillful command of General Göring, and his contribution was particularly significant. On the army side, the overall planning and deployment of General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, was outstanding. Domestically, Deputy Führer Hess, SA Chief of Staff Lutze, and Political Police Chief Himmler provided support and assistance. In addition, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and others all made meritorious contributions to the party and the country.

Promotions and Awards for Generals

Hitler then announced that in addition to being promoted to the rank of Field Marshal of Greater Germany, Göring was also awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Other generals promoted to the rank of Field Marshal included: (1) General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces; (2) General Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the Army; (3) General Rundstedt, Commander of the Army Group; (4) General Leeb, Commander of the Army Group; General Bock, Commander of the Army Group; (5) General List, Commander of the Army Group; (6) General Kluge, Commander of the Army Group; (7) General Reichenau, Commander of the Army Group; (8) General Weichs; (9) General Milch, Undersecretary of the Air Force; (10) General Sperrle, Air Force General; (11) General Kesselring, Air Force Commander.

Satisfied with German-Italian Cooperation

The Führer mentioned the current political situation, saying that his foreign policy plans were: first, to obtain genuine friendship and understanding with Italy, and second, to obtain the same relationship with Britain. But despite my various efforts, I have ultimately failed to obtain friendship with Britain, otherwise, it would have been of profound and great benefit to the future happiness of both countries. However, I am still deeply fortunate for the success of the first point. This should be attributed to the genius of the Italian people's leader. When Britain and France were about to start a war against Germany last year, I and Mussolini established an agreement that should be observed by both countries. Germany's gains from Italy's attitude were enormous, benefiting both economically and militarily. Italy's participation in the war was entirely of its own choice, first fighting in the Alps, and now using the revolutionary spirit of fascism to carry out large-scale attacks with the navy and air force. We are now following closely behind in the spirit of National Socialism. Our political and military cooperation can be described as perfect, and as a result, we will achieve a joint victory.

Ability to Sustain Warfare

Regarding the current and future situation, the Führer stated that according to the various developments of the past ten months, it has proven the correctness of my observations and the errors of the enemy. Germany has been strengthened by victory. Germany's losses this time are considered extremely small compared to the World War. The number of losses in the war in Norway and the war in the Netherlands and France is negligible compared to the total amount of production. The supply of munitions is endless, and even production must be restricted. As far as the raw materials required for the war, coal and iron are concerned, even if imports are stopped, it will have no impact on Germany. As for the abundance of food, there is nothing to fear, no matter how long the war lasts. The enemy uses various propaganda methods to undermine the unity of the German people, but the people's attitude is not moved in the slightest. The war in October has only strengthened the people's determination.

Friendly German-Soviet Relations

Hitler continued by describing Germany's relationship with various countries, stating that German-Soviet relations have been determined, and it is a naive fantasy to hope that German-Soviet relations will become tense again. Neither Germany nor the Soviet Union has taken steps beyond their spheres of influence in Poland.

Peace or Destruction

Hitler recalled that he delivered a speech on October 6 last year, making peace proposals to Britain and France. Currently, France has a different view on the rejection of peace at that time, but the politicians of Britain, not the people of Britain, are still calling for the continuation of the war. Do these politicians have the correct understanding to continue the war? They do not hesitate for Britain to be occupied, but the British people cannot all move to Canada and will remain in Britain. Churchill declared that he needed the war. He started the air raids on German civilians six weeks ago, bombing undefended cities and villages. Germany did not retaliate, knowing that if it did, the British people would suffer. At that time, Churchill and the warmongers would have fled to Canada. Churchill should at least trust this prediction, that the great world empire will be destroyed. Germany has no intention of destroying or infringing upon this world empire. The continuation of the war will lead to the complete destruction of one of the belligerent countries. Does Churchill think that Germany will be destroyed? I know that the one to be destroyed will be Britain.

Final Appeal to Britain

At present, I believe that I have the responsibility on my conscience to urge Britain to use common sense. I believe I can make this appeal because I am not making an appeal from a defeated country, but the rational words of a victorious country. I do not see any urgent reason to continue the war. I regret the soldiers sacrificed in the war, and I also hope that the German people will be spared from the scourge of war. I know that the German young men are eager to fight against the enemies who declared war on Germany for no reason. Churchill may again regard my remarks as an expression of doubt about Germany's final victory, but at least I will not feel uneasy in my conscience about the future development. At the end of his speech, Hitler conveyed his animosity to the soldiers who served the country. (Haitong dispatch from the 20th)

### General Göring Warns Britain: Whether the War Can Be Avoided Depends on Britain's Attitude

Berlin – Before the close of the Reichstag, General Göring, in his capacity as Speaker, addressed all members, briefly stating, "One World War has ended, and another great war is about to happen. Whether it will happen depends on whether Hitler's appeal can be accepted by the other party." Göring's statement is regarded as a warning to Britain, "saying that Führer Hitler is prepared to launch a blitzkrieg against Britain at any time." Göring also said, "Germany's tactics are quite like a miracle, and also a revolution of various war principles that have been praised for a time. This tactic has destroyed all the enemy's plans. All German people believe in this novel and miraculous weapon. Now Germany's novel tactics are not only recognized by all Germans but also by the whole world." (United Press dispatch from the 20th)

### The King of England Inspects the Air Force

London – King George VI personally inspected several military aircraft fields today and inspected the air force. (Havas dispatch from the 19th)

### Speculation on the Contents of Peace Terms

Basel – A reporter from a local newspaper stationed in Berlin claimed that Germany's offensive against Britain has been slowed down in order to establish and test a new political action. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)

Tokyo – A reporter from the Allied News Agency stationed in Berlin claimed that it is expected that the war in Europe will be temporarily quiet in the next few days because Hitler must wait for Britain's reaction to the peace proposals he made in his speech to the Reichstag. If Britain firmly rejects it, then Germany will launch a full-scale attack on Britain. From the general sentiment in Germany, the contents of the peace terms seem to be: (1) The withdrawal of Churchill and his faction from the British government, and their replacement by a cabinet centered on Lloyd George and the British fascist leader Mosley; (2) The reduction of British armaments and the recognition of Germany's hegemony in Europe. The reporter concluded that it is almost certain that Britain will reject Germany's terms. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)

### German Planes Fly Low and Bomb, Intense Air Battles Over the Entire British Territory, Eleven German Planes Shot Down, British Air Force Flies to Germany to Retaliate

London – After yesterday's major air raid by German aircraft, German aircraft intruded into British airspace again today, dropping bombs and engaging in a deadly battle with British fighters over a vast area of the sky. It is reported that the intensity of this air battle is unprecedented since the war. Today, German aircraft activity in British territory is extensive, with German aircraft detected over the southeast and southwest of Scotland, and the southwest and northeast of England, with reports of dense anti-aircraft fire. Near a certain mining town in southeastern Scotland, only fire was seen lighting up the sky, and the fire spread, covering a distance of one mile. This is a brief report of today's German air raid on Britain. As for yesterday, when Führer Hitler hinted that the "most terrifying war in the world" was about to come, the British and German air forces were engaged in fierce attacks against each other. After German Stuka dive bombers were discovered from the clouds, they dropped high-explosive bombs on British convoys off the southeast coast of England like a sudden rainstorm. The British Air Force flew into German territory in retaliation. Factories and oil depots in Bremen, Hanover, and Essen were reportedly bombed and burned. The famous Krupp artillery factory was also bombed. According to British Air Force reports, the explosion was clearly visible when the factory was hit. Yesterday's unprecedented low-altitude bombing of the British coast by German planes can be described as unprecedented. Twenty-two powerful Stuka dive bombers dived low from the clouds at the same time, carrying out large-scale destruction. British naval anti-aircraft guns and fighters fiercely resisted after the German planes were discovered, lasting for several hours. At that time, only machine gun fire, anti-aircraft gun fire, and bomb sounds were heard along the coast, and the windows of various towns along the coast were shattered, but there was no news of any British ships being hit. The scope of British planes bombing northwest Germany and the Rhineland was also wide, lasting for a long time. According to the Ministry of Aviation, the airfield of Mülhausen, Paderborn, Rothenburg, Rommerskirchen, and Xanten were successively bombed and damaged by the British Air Force on Thursday evening and last night. The fuel depots in Harlington, Bremen, and Norway were also bombed and burned. (United Press dispatch from the 20th)

London – According to the Ministry of Aviation's communique last night, twenty-two German bombers attacked ships over the British coast yesterday afternoon, dropping twenty bombs. No British ships were hit. Anti-aircraft guns fired at them, eventually driving the German planes out to sea. One crew member of a German plane jumped out with a parachute. It is believed that the plane has fallen into the Strait. Yesterday, British fighters and anti-aircraft guns fought fiercely with a large number of enemy planes several times off the southeast coast of England. Eight enemy planes were shot down by British fighters, and one was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. Several other planes were damaged. A total of eleven enemy planes were shot down yesterday, including four bombers and seven fighters. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)

Berlin – Last night, officials here announced that this afternoon, German Air Force personnel, flying several Messerschmitt 109 fighters, shot down twelve British new Defiant fighters, two Spitfires, and one Hurricane over the Strait. We suffered no losses. (Haitong dispatch from the 20th)

### Italian Foreign Minister Visits Hitler for Important Talks

London – According to Swiss radio news, Hitler received Italian Foreign Minister Ciano at noon today, with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also in attendance. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)

Berlin – Ciano will depart from Berlin tonight and return to Rome. Today, Ciano met with Hess and General Göring and attended a grand event held by the Italian Embassy in Germany. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop hosted a banquet to welcome Ciano, and the guests and hosts had a pleasant time. (Haitong dispatch from the 20th)

### Germany's Peace Gesture is Received Coldly by Britain, Recognized as a Sincere Effort; Resistance to Aggression is Well-Prepared

Stockholm – London Radio last night commented on Hitler's speech to the Reichstag, saying that Britain felt cold about the peace proposals, and Britain was determined to move forward with an indomitable spirit to achieve the goal of victory. (Haitong Agency dispatch from the 20th)

London – Officials here last night closely followed Führer Hitler's speech to the Berlin Parliament, stating that Führer Hitler's "vague peace gesture" would not be accepted by Britain. It is recognized here that Führer Hitler's speech was an insincere attempt to arouse the peace elements here and weaken Britain's combat power. (United Press dispatch from the 20th)

London – A diplomatic reporter from Reuters said that connoisseurs here believe that Hitler's speech is empty and worthless, and only berates the British Prime Minister, so it is not worth an official reaction. Of course, the Prime Minister will state his views in the House of Commons, as for the value of Hitler's speech, the readers can judge for themselves. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)

London – After German Führer Hitler delivered a speech in the German House of Commons today to launch peace talks, observers here commented that the British government should propose a formal reply, the gist of which is to defend Hitler's claim that Britain did not hesitate to destroy the neutrality of small countries in order to expand the scope of the war. Political figures claim that the German Führer's desire for neutral countries to come forward to mediate so as to quickly end the war has been expressed in this speech. However, other people believe that Germany knows that attacking Britain will inevitably encounter great difficulties, and this speech is to urge the German people to prepare for a long war. As for British officials, they refuse to comment on this speech, only saying that Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech a few days ago, reiterating his determination to resist the war, which is a clear reply to Hitler. In short, Britain has made large-scale preparations to resist the enemy's attack, and everything is well prepared. (Havas dispatch from the 19th)

### Hitler's Speech is Clearly Issued Internally

Washington – The first impression of Hitler's speech here is that the main purpose of Hitler's speech is issued internally, and there are no naval officers among the military personnel announced by Hitler, which shows that the German Navy has not won glory. Hitler's statement that one of Britain and Germany will perish in the struggle shows the terrifying nature of the struggle he intends to carry out at present. People here do not believe that Britain will consider Hitler's indirect peace proposals, and it is predicted that large-scale struggles will begin in a matter of days or even hours. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)

New York – Today, the "New York World-Telegram" stated that Hitler's speech in the Reichstag yesterday was a "masterpiece of false compassion and distortion of facts." The newspaper also said that this war is not only a desperate struggle, but a war in which if Britain survives, Hitlerism will be destroyed. The "New York Times" stated that Hitler's ultimatum is the same as before in form and substance, containing the same falsified history as Hitler's previous several speeches. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)

### The Italian Government Praises it as a Great Political Action

Rome – The Italian official news agency stated that Rome welcomes Hitler's speech, praising it as a "great political action" and a "great victorious speech by a great statesman." Hitler's mention of Italy is welcomed by the Weimar side. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)

### Australia Increases its Defense Strength; Prime Minister Menzies Announces that a Large Army is Massed in the Barracks

Sydney – Australian Prime Minister Menzies stated last night that the great changes in the European situation make it impossible to predict when Australia and Australian troops will be needed overseas. At present, a large army is massed in the Australian barracks. For this reason, the military force waiting to be dispatched in Australia will be temporarily limited to 80,000 people, and new recruits will have to be temporarily suspended. There are already 77,000 soldiers in the barracks everywhere, which is more than at any time during the last war. Australia is now doing its best to increase the strength of the National Defense Forces to 250,000 people. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)

Sydney – Australia's comments on Hitler's speech can be seen in the following remarks of Australian Prime Minister Menzies, who said that the Germanic Empire, which is based on tyranny and bloodshed, will be destroyed, not only because Britain insists on fighting, but the British Empire is no exception. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)

### Canada Reaffirms its Determination and Vows to Back Britain

Ottawa – The general public in Canada believes that the peace proposals made by Hitler in his speech yesterday did not contain any language worthy of consideration by the British Empire. These proposals are intended to cover the ears and eyes of the Germans and neutral countries. Some observers recognize that Hitler's speech contains an indication that he will invade Britain soon. However, the Canadian people reaffirm and back Britain to the last man. Canadians are not at all troubled by Hitler's claim that the British government will move to Canada, because Canadians understand that if the British government takes this action, it will be nothing more than a plan to continue the war. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)

### General Ironside Promoted to Commander-in-Chief of British Forces; Sir Brooke Succeeds as Commander-in-Chief of Home Forces

London. Britain responded to Chancellor Hitler's "rational appeal" last night with a new challenge: appointing a new Commander-in-Chief for 1.5 million British troops. General Ironside has been promoted to the rank of Field Marshal. (United Press report, 20th)

London. General Ironside has been promoted to the rank of General. Viscount Gort has been transferred to the position of Inspector-General of Training. Sir Brooke, Commander-in-Chief of Southern Command, has been transferred to the position of Commander-in-Chief of Home Forces, succeeding General Ironside. Major General Alexander, who commanded the British retreat at Dunkirk under Viscount Gort, has been promoted to Lieutenant General upon his return to England. Lieutenant General Auchinleck has succeeded Sir Brooke as Commander-in-Chief of Southern Command. It is rumored that General Ironside will continue to serve in an active capacity as an advisor or to command troops. (Reuters report, 20th)

### Naval Battle in the Mediterranean; One Italian Ship Sunk; Air Raid on Eritrean Airport

London. The British Admiralty announced that the Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in the Mediterranean reported that the Australian ship "Sydney" (Captain Collinsland) and a squadron of destroyers engaged two Italian cruisers in the early morning south of Crete, Greece. The Italian cruiser "Colleoni" was sunk. The other Italian cruiser escaped. The British fleet is in pursuit. 250 Italian soldiers from the "Colleoni" were rescued by a British destroyer. The "Colleoni" was a 5,000-ton light cruiser that was once stationed in the Far East. Its entire crew consisted of 500 men. It was armed with eight 6-inch guns, six 3.9-inch guns, and sixteen anti-aircraft guns. The "Sydney" displaces 6,800 tons and its armament is similar to that of the "Colleoni". (Reuters report, 20th)

Rome. The Italian military headquarters issued a war report this afternoon stating that in the early morning of yesterday, our light cruisers "Bartolomeo Colleoni" and "Giovanni delle Bande Nere" (both 5,000 tons) engaged two British armored cruisers and four destroyers near Crete. The naval battle lasted for three hours. Although the enemy's strength was superior, they suffered heavy damage. Our cruiser "Colleoni" was hit and destroyed and sank immediately.

All British aircraft returned safely to their bases. (Reuters report, 20th)

British Troops Reinforce Gibraltar

Madrid. Three British transport ships carrying British troops have arrived in Gibraltar, making the situation there very serious. Since General Franco publicly demanded the return of the territory two days ago, over 3,000 British troops have arrived there. 1,600 men have already landed fully armed, while 1,700 men remain on board awaiting orders. According to news from New York, returning Americans claim to have seen German soldiers in uniform and German advance teams spread throughout Spain. (International News Service report, 20th)

(20th Dispatch)

Hong Kong. Tokyo dispatch. The results of Konoe's cabinet formation have not yet been announced. However, since the selections for the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy have been decided, it is widely believed that Konoe will select full-time ministers for the six ministries of Interior, Finance, Commerce and Industry, Agriculture and Forestry, Education, and Justice. The remaining four ministries of Communications, Railways, Colonial Affairs, and Welfare will be concurrently held by other ministers. The Army Minister of the Yonai Cabinet, Shunroku Hata, Vice Minister Anami, and other important figures held a meeting at 10:40 this morning to hear Hideki Tojo's report on the results of yesterday's meetings with Konoe, Matsuoka, and Yoshida. It is reported that a consensus was reached on basic policies regarding diplomacy and national defense during yesterday afternoon's meeting. (20th Dispatch)

Tokyo. Japan's new Prime Minister Konoe stated that he had discussed resolving Sino-Japanese disputes, strengthening Japanese-German-Italian relations, and the policies Japan intends to adopt toward Britain and the United States with the new Army Minister Lieutenant General Hideki Tojo, Navy Minister Admiral Zengo Yoshida, and Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka. Their opinions were quite harmonious. (Haitong News Agency report, 20th)

Tokyo. When Prime Minister Konoe met with reporters yesterday, he stated that he is currently busy forming a new cabinet, so the nationwide single-party movement may be delayed for some time. As for the new cabinet's attitude towards existing parties and future new political structures, no decision has yet been made. His original intention was to create a new political structure as a private citizen. However, due to the trend of the situation, he had to accept the mandate and form a new cabinet. In short, the new cabinet and the new structure are one and two, and two and one. However, it is difficult to proceed with the two simultaneously, and the organization of the new structure will have to be postponed for the time being. (Havas report, 19th)

Moscow. The "Pravda" published a commentary today, discussing the changes in the Japanese cabinet. The newspaper stated, "The Yonai cabinet resigned due to pressure from the military. Konoe, who was ordered to form a cabinet, represents the military's expectations in both domestic and foreign affairs. He is the inventor of the 'construction of a new order in East Asia' and also initiated Japan's 'National Mobilization Law.' In short, the change in the Japanese cabinet is a harbinger of drastic changes in Japan's domestic and foreign policies." (TASS report, 19th)

Rome. Italian side welcomed the new Japanese cabinet formed by Fumimaro Konoe yesterday, it will move Japan further along the road to joining the Rome-Berlin military and political axis. Mussolini's mouthpiece Gaida wrote that "the formation of the new Japanese cabinet is proceeding along the political lines of Germany and Italy. (United Press report, 20th)

### German-Hungarian Trade Agreement Signed

Berlin. The official Hungarian news agency reporter stationed in Budapest claimed that the new German-Hungarian trade agreement has been signed today. It is said that in view of the general situation in Europe, this new agreement will only be valid for one year, rather than the usual three years as in previous German-Hungarian trade agreements. (Reuters report, 20th)

### Italian Aircraft Drops Bombs, Mistaking Target, Takes Rocky Island for British Ship

New York. Newspapers here all carry dispatches from the Greek capital, saying that Italian aircraft mistakenly identified a rocky island south of Cephalonia, Greece, as the British ship "Hotspur" and bombed it heavily.

### US Democratic Party Delegates Return Home Joyfully, But Anxious About the General Election; Farley Familiar with Political Life

Chicago. The delegates of the Democratic Convention have joyfully set out to return home after listening to the speech of President Roosevelt's instigator, but they are anxious about the prospect of the election in November. They are all aware that there is no other way but to elect President Roosevelt for another term, but those who respect Roosevelt mostly feel that it is too long for one person to be in power continuously for twelve years. Many people are still indignant about the convention being controlled by President Roosevelt's friends. Democratic vice-presidential candidate Wallace must strive to campaign vigorously in the agricultural states in order to achieve his goals. However, Wallace was opposed by Southern Democrats at the convention, who felt that the vice-presidential seat should be held by a Democrat from the South in order to be fair. According to past practice, any Democratic Party must win the powerful votes of the Southern states to win. Since the incumbent president and vice-presidential candidates hold the same foreign policy, the focus of the campaign will be on domestic policy, that is, whether the country is willing to continue the effectiveness of the philosophy of new measures. (Reuters report, 20th)

Washington. An anti-Roosevelt third-term movement has occurred within the Democratic Party. The Republican National Committee announced that former US Army Commander Chadwick has joined Nebraska Senator Burke to oppose the Democratic Party and provide assistance to Republican candidate Willkie. At the same time, Southern California Senator Smith announced that he will not assist President Roosevelt's re-election. He said, "But at the same time, I will not vote for the Republican Party." The Republican National Committee quoted Chadwick as saying, "A third term will endanger our democratic spirit." At the same time, Senator Burke predicted that a Democratic People's Congress will be organized to support Willkie and oppose Roosevelt's re-election policy. (United Press report, 20th)

Chicago. Postmaster Farley announced today that he will resign from his position as chairman of the Democratic National Convention and will discuss his departure from the cabinet with President Roosevelt. Farley strongly supported Visforth and Wallace in this election. (Reuters report, 19th)

Chicago. The chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Farley, officially resigned yesterday after the campaign convention closed. From now on, he will not be involved in politics and will end his life with the pastime of baseball. It was previously rumored that Farley would organize a board of directors, serve as chairman, and purchase the New York American baseball club from the successor of the late Rupert. This rumor has now been confirmed by Farley himself. There have been many rumors about Farley's whereabouts in the past few weeks. Some said Farley would be elected president, some said he would become a leader in the automatic machine industry, and some said he would continue his political activities in other fields. However, all these rumors have now been dispelled. (International News Service report, 20th)

### Most Americans Advocate Aid to Britain; 15,000 People Request to Join the Canadian Air Force

New York. According to a recent survey by the Public Opinion Agency, the desire of the American public to aid Britain in various ways, apart from participating in the war, has not diminished slightly due to the defeat of France. The opinions of voters from both the Democratic and Republican parties are rarely divided on this point. 53% believe that the United States should give Britain more assistance, 11% believe that the United States has already given sufficient assistance, 6% believe that the United States should give less assistance, 10% did not express an opinion, and among the aforementioned 53%, 15% advocate that the United States should declare war on Germany and Italy. (Reuters report, 20th)

Ottawa. An official spokesman said that more than 15,000 Americans have requested to join the Canadian Air Force. (International News Service report, 20th)

### Rumor that Germany Has Made Harsh Demands on Southern Nations, Coercing Them to Organize a New Right-Wing Cabinet; Turkey Decides to Ally with Britain

Beijing. It is rumored that Germany has made harsh demands on Yugoslavia to align its policies with the Rome-Berlin Axis. It is heard that the German ambassador to Yugoslavia, Heinar, visited the Yugoslav regent, Prince Paul, at his summer retreat, demanding that he organize a new right-wing cabinet. This new action by Germany in Yugoslavia is believed to be an indication that Germany's influence in the Balkans is expanding. Recalling that the Soviet army entered Pukanova against Germany's wishes two days ago, diplomatic circles here are closely watching the future situation. (International News Service report, 20th)

Ankara. The Istanbul "Janisbal" newspaper published an article, emphasizing Turkey's determination to stand with Britain, saying, "Turkey is full of confidence in its alliance with Britain and believes that Turkey will receive all possible assistance from its allies when necessary. As long as Britain stands firm, Turkey will not be attacked. If Britain wins, Turkey will not be harmed, and will emerge stronger from the current crisis. The reason for our alliance with Britain lies in this. As far as the Mediterranean naval battle is concerned, the fact that the Italian ships could not hold out for more than fifteen minutes is obvious. Needless to say, the British navy still holds the highest authority in the eastern and western parts of the Mediterranean, and this advantage is becoming increasingly strong. All countries that have lost their independence and freedom place their hopes on the final victory of the British navy, and this hope is becoming increasingly bright." The Turkish newspaper "Kenhreli" commented on British Prime Minister Churchill's statement that "Britain will soon not tolerate Germany's control of Europe," saying that Churchill's words prove that Britain does not intend to seek peace and is even prepared to fight a three-year war. Another Turkish newspaper, "Ulas", published an editorial titled "Britain's Insurmountable Determination," saying that Britain still stands firm and its naval and air forces are stronger than ever, and is not discouraged by the German army's conquest of territory in continental Europe. (Reuters report, 20th)

### German Wartime Morale

When Germany started the war, many observers were inevitably worried about her. Now, after ten months of testing, coupled with various wartime difficulties coming one after another, the situation is better than initially expected, hoped for, or even thought possible. Although the German people are everywhere stretched thin by the difficulties of the wartime economy, and rumors abound; various productions and daily necessities are subjected to ruthless government intervention and control, especially in each season, the days are like years, almost unbearable. However, today, behind the military and political leaders of the National Socialist Party, they have created a stronger and more vigorous morale than at any time in the past four years. As a result, the German government can now rely on the people, their unity and unwavering determination have increased many times more than when the war began.

As for a government that uses military adventures to determine the fate of the country, the German people's morale at the beginning of the war can be said to be extremely bad. Most non-National Socialist Germans did not approve of the war at all at that time. This opposition was not based on moral concepts, but on the aversion to the horror of war. They really believed that if Germany made a do-or-die gamble, it would be impossible to survive. Over the years, the National Socialist Party failed to deeply imprint the power of the Soviet Union's propaganda on the minds of the Germans. The middle-aged people still remember the situation of the last war and the aftermath, how could they not be wary of the new war?

On the other hand, the German officials, party army, and the youth led by Hitler all believed that this war was just a continuation of Germany's heroic military policy of foreign expansion. In short, if we talk about the entire country, the situation in September of last year was quite critical. Now, regardless of the difficulties, the country has become united and the people's determination is very high.

Domestic hostility towards the National Socialist Party's regime has naturally weakened. In addition to this reason and the Soviet Union's confidence in its military power, there are two other factors that deserve our attention. One is that the "morale" organization is managed with political and police force, which is very strict and efficient. In the past ten months, the great police force created by Police Chief Himmler has proven to be effective after testing.

Another is the development of German solidarity since the start of the war. Most of the German people have confirmed that this war is an enemy attacking Germany, not attacking the National Socialist Party. Whether such an opinion can represent the most powerful general view, or is simply a harvest of clever and lasting propaganda, is left to be questioned. However, it is very believable that the views heard are not only limited to these. Even in private conversations with non-National Socialist Germans, they all say that this war was forced upon Germany by Britain, and that Germany was threatened by life and arbitrarily invaded. They listed the jealousy, fear, and suspicion of Germany by other countries as explanations or justifications for the current state. They have faintly forgotten the sins of invading Austria and Czechoslovakia, cleverly decorated them, or even put them behind their heads. The German people accept what the officials announce. Many middle-class and conservative intellectuals have now tended towards anti-British, which feels more real than the anti-National Socialist psychology they showed with trepidation one or two years ago. Some people, sometimes called "better Germans," mostly support National Socialist politics today, partly due to their own convictions and partly due to compulsion. Because of the forced environment, intense "patriotic madness" has become the center of their beliefs.

The unity of the whole country and the cooperation of all parties that opposed the current government in the past can be seen from all classes. Among the working class, regardless of their resentment towards wartime difficulties, they do not feel the slightest doubt about the necessity of fighting against "British oligarchy." The German working class has been persuaded by the authorities and has almost fallen into a hypnotic state. The belief that the Germans are fighting for a "new social order" is widely circulated in the minds of most people, consciously or unconsciously. (Translated from Manchester Guardian)

### Key to the Mediterranean

Malta. Located between Sicily and Tunisia in Italy, it is a necessary route from the western to the eastern Mediterranean and has always been the key for Britain to dominate the Mediterranean. It has an area of 122 square miles and a population of over 200,000. The whole island is made of rock and has no soil. Soil is transported from Sicily to cultivate citrus, wheat, potatoes, cotton, etc. The island has been a French territory since 1798 and was occupied by Britain in 1800. The capital is called Valletta, located on the east coast of Malta. The harbor is surrounded by a number of small islands, the terrain is dangerous, and is rarely matched in the world. The British have copper walls and iron ramparts on the island, and there is also a strong fleet stationed there. It is called the heart of the Mediterranean.

Gibraltar. A small peninsula at the southernmost tip of Spain, with an area of only two square miles, facing Morocco's Ceuta from afar, it is the gateway to the Mediterranean and a vital transportation hub. The center is a strait connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, 36 miles long and 15 miles wide at its narrowest point. The promontory is surrounded by cliffs on three sides, suitable for large ships to dock, and is a naturally formed fortress. The west is a slope, Gibraltar Bay, with a solid bastion. It originally belonged to Spain and has been in British hands since 1704. In 1779, France and Spain jointly attacked it with their navies for 43 months without success, which shows the dangerousness of its terrain. At present, the United Kingdom has strong fortresses and coaling stations on Windmill Hill at the southeast end of the peninsula, and has stationed heavy troops to control it. A military port is opened on the west bank to station warships. It echoes Malta to the east and is the naval base of the Mediterranean.

Suez Canal. Located between Asia and Africa, it is the gateway to the Red Sea. When the French man, Lei Sai, supervised the Suez Canal, the British thought there was no possibility of success and completely ignored it. Who knew that in 1869, the Cape of Good Hope lost its importance, and the Suez Canal became a convenient route from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean. At that time, France's power in Egypt was very strong. The British immediately caught up. In less than 15 years, partly because Britain used violent policies against Egypt, and partly because French diplomacy failed to cope properly, the major rights of the Suez Canal shareholders fell into the hands of the British. As a result, the navigation from the eastern Mediterranean to India was completely in her tight grip.

Aden. Located on the southwest coast of the Arabian Peninsula, it controls the mouth of the Red Sea. It has an area of only 75 square miles and a population of 55,000. It was originally under the jurisdiction of Turkey and became independent in 1730, managed by a Muslim king. In 1836, a British ship was plundered in its territory, and the Muslim king ceded it to Britain. By 1839, it was entirely owned by Britain and under the jurisdiction of the Bombay Province of India. The site is a key point on the shipping routes between Europe and Asia, and is a key British coaling port. To the west is Perim Island in the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, with an area of only five square miles, under the jurisdiction of Aden, guarding the mouth of the strait and controlling the throat of the Red Sea. The British have built a strong fortress on the island, so British-Indian transportation is worry-free.

### Finance: British and American Exchange Rates Rise and Fall, Running in Opposite Directions All Day Long

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices were flat, and the British and American exchange rates in the black market ran in opposite directions throughout the day, rising and falling, which was very uncertain. Initially, because the New York pound suddenly rose by one jiao, the opening British exchange rate immediately softened to three ban shi eight four three seven five, while the US dollar hardened to six yuan two one eight seven five. Then, it was heard that HSBC Bank had a large amount of shillings for sale, so it hardened back to three ban shi eight seven five, and came to arbitrage US dollars. Later, news of the Sino-Soviet military alliance was added, and it was predicted that the pound would weaken today. Chinese banks and speculators took advantage of the cheap price to arbitrage US dollars, and Hong Kong Electricity sold a limited amount, so it softened to only six nine one two five. Finally, because the Sino-British Bank slightly sold off, it hardened slightly. The closing price was three ban shi eight five nine three seven five for British gold, six yuan one five six two five for US dollars, British tight zero four six eight seven five, and US flat. Futures were unanimously softening, and trading was very active. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Spot British Tight, US No Change

In the early morning, due to large London strips, both near and far rose by 125. The New York silver price remained flat, the London raw gold remained fixed, the exchange rate of British against the US was unchanged, and there was no market against Shanghai or France. The US against the British rose by one jiao, there was no change against Shanghai, and there was no market against France. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's spot selling price was three ban shi eight four three seven five for British gold and six yuan two one eight seven five for US exchange, which was higher than the previous day's British tight zero six two five and the US dollar hardened zero six two five, which was due to the increase in the exchange rate. After the opening, speculators first had an appetite, and calculated that the US dollar was sold at six yuan one eight seven five in the American bank. HSBC announced that the listed price would not move, and the white silver balance tax was announced to increase by one point zero zero. After that, Hong Kong Electricity once blocked out the US dollar for this month, and foreign banks were willing to absorb it, and the market softened instead. It was calculated that the opening price was six yuan one eight seven five and one five six two five. At that time, news of the Sino-Soviet military alliance was spread, and people's hearts were slightly affected. Chinese merchants and Chinese banks tended to buy in, and it was calculated that the US dollar for August was sold by the American bank to Chinese merchants at six yuan one two five. Macgalley sold the US dollar for the same month to the Chinese bank at six yuan zero nine three seven five. It was heard that the tightest US dollar was advertised at six yuan one two five. By noon, the potential was still softening. Speculators again entered Macgalley and other US dollars for this month at six yuan one five six two five. The closing price was three ban shi eight five nine three seven five for British gold and six yuan one five six two five for US dollars. British gold for this month was the same price as spot, US dollar six yuan one two five, British gold for August three ban shi eight one two five, US dollar six yuan zero six two five. Compared with yesterday's closing price, spot British tight zero four six eight seven five, US no honor or disgrace, British for July shrink zero four six eight seven five, US soft zero three one two five, British and US for August each tight zero six two five and zero three one two five.

Hong Kong US Dollar Fluctuates Greatly

Hong Kong, 20th (Saturday) Electric: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The US dollar fluctuated greatly. The spot British dollar had no honor or disgrace. The spot US dollar was loose 125, at 23 yuan 75. The spot Shanghai dollar rose by one yuan, to 383 yuan (yesterday's closing price was 382 yuan), the spot Japanese dollar rose by half a yuan, to 100 yuan 05 jiao.

The black market for "Joint Notes" rose slightly by two jiao and a half, to 93 yuan and a half.

### Rumors Good, Gold Market Revives

Yesterday's cash exchange black market situation was unexpected. The weekend delivery day suddenly rose in buying interest, and it was able to advance upward. This was because people's hearts were affected by various bullish rumors, and the rumored peaceful atmosphere has now completely disappeared. Moreover, there are reports of a Sino-Soviet military alliance, an emergency in Zhenhai, Ningbo, and news that a new Central Bank will open. It is rumored in the market, coupled with the fact that the profitable shorts in the middle of this week have reached the weekend and initially came to compensate, so in a situation of large gains and small returns, the price has jumped out of 5,300 yuan. People's hearts in all directions have turned firm, and the exchange market is quietly softening, and the price of gold is easy to rise and difficult to fall. The market was mediocre in the early morning, opening at 5,230 yuan, and fell to a low price of 5,205 yuan due to scattered retail sales. After 10:30, the exchange market strengthened, and securities gangs and gold shops successively entered the market to purchase, and demand increased sharply. Soon it rushed out of the 5,300 yuan mark. Although it was slightly fixed at noon, the closing price had been raised to 5,345 yuan, an increase of 125 yuan from the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. The half-day transaction was first cleared and then strong, and it was estimated to be about 2,000 taels. The price of gold jewelry in silver shops was raised by 10 yuan, and the customs gold remained flat.

Exchange Red Rises 125 Yuan

From the morning, each piece (ten taels), initially the silver shop selling gold to the gold shop for ten taels, was still 5,220 yuan, with no honor or disgrace compared to the previous day. Then, because the securities gang slightly sold off, and at that time there was no shortage of retail sales to short, it stepped down by a small 15 yuan. Securities and hardware shops twenty taels, inferior to 5,205 yuan. Then, a certain money exchange business suddenly came to absorb fiercely, and the silver shop gang's appetite was very strong, and retail shorts saw the scene and hedged, and soon pulled up 55 yuan, the silver shop entered the money exchange business twenty taels, for 5,260 yuan. Later, a certain silver shop and securities gang sold off, plus a certain money exchange business also slightly returned, so it returned a small 20 yuan, the money exchange business sold to the silver shop fifty taels, for 5,240 yuan. At that time, many bullish news were frequently reported in the market, and the foreign exchange market strengthened as a result. The buying interest in the market followed, and securities gangs, silver shops, gold shops, etc. scrambled to arbitrage wildly, and soon rushed out of the 5,300 yuan mark. Silver shops did each other twenty taels, for 5,330 yuan. At this time, the buying interest slightly frustrated, and it was once seen to fall back to 5,310 yuan, but in the end, because people's hearts were upward, low prices came to search for purchases again, and the price was raised again by 30 to 40 yuan, the silver shop entered the gold shop twenty taels, for 5,345 yuan, as the noon closing price. As a result, it was 125 yuan higher than the previous day, with a range of 140 yuan in half a day. The selling price of the current gold shop's own brand gold was more than 10 yuan higher than the exchange price, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current spot gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.

Gold Jewelry Only Raised by 10 Yuan

The exchange price of gold jewelry in silver shops was initially 540 yuan in Datonghang, but at around 11:00, it was raised by 10 yuan, and there was no change in the afternoon. It was calculated that Datonghang changed to 550 yuan, and the new counterparts were similar to the upper price, with the purchase price reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Foreign Currency Suddenly Rises After Falling

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: The British and American gold pounds first fell and then rose, and finally each rose by three yuan. There was continued demand for British gold tickets, and the market price remained high. The US gold ticket initially fell because the pound price rose sharply, and the supply was very smooth in the early morning. The market price retreated to 16 yuan and 08 points. Then, it was suddenly reported that there was a Sino-Soviet alliance, which caused the black market US dollar to step down, rising to 16 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2 points at noon. It slightly returned to 16 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2 points in the afternoon, still rising by 1 jiao and 4 points compared to the previous day. The Hong Kong ticket rose slightly by one point following the exchange rate between Hong Kong and Shanghai. There was no shortage of demand for Canadian and Philippine tickets, and the market prices uniformly rose. The Japanese gold ticket remained weak, and the evening price was 2 jiao and 1 point for hospitals. The supply and demand of Korean tickets were uniform, and the evening price remained 1 yuan and 3 points.

### Securities: Floating Short Positions Added, Domestic Debt Weak and Depressed

Yesterday's black market situation for unified government bonds continued to show a decline and fell again. Because the situation in eastern Zhejiang was tense and rumors in Ningbo were inconsistent, there was a fear of bullishness. Therefore, the buying interest of the previous few days was suddenly swept away. Speculators and floating short positions took the opportunity to frequently add positions and sell heavily, resulting in an oversupply of chips on the table. The market atmosphere softened as a result. Renfeng, Renchang, Lianyi No. 5, etc. still had a buying interest, so the trend was soft and stable. However, because Lianhe, Hongda, Yongda, Lemao, etc. worked tirelessly, the price was suppressed. The market atmosphere was clear in the afternoon, and prices continued to decline. Although Xieda No. 64 and No. 35, etc. had a lot of intention to supply, under the pull of Jiufeng, Lianhe, Lianyi, etc., they slightly strengthened. However, as a result, except for Class D, which showed a slight improvement of 5 points due to supply and demand, the others unanimously continued to fall by 2 jiao to half a yuan. Turnover decreased, only about 800,000 yuan was weak. A brief table is listed as follows:

Stock trading: 40 shares of Ningshao Company stock were traded at a price of 13 yuan and 5 jiao.

London, 19th (Friday) Electric: The listed prices of various Far East British company stocks today were generally stable. Only the stock price of the Korean Coal Mine fell by two shillings and six pence, to four shillings. The rest remained unchanged.

London, 19th (Friday) Electric: The listed prices of Chinese foreign debts today remained stable. There were no changes in the upper and lower bonds.

### Financial Review - As of July 20 - Review of the Amount of Legal Tender Issued

- Qiong

The Chinese government recently announced that the amount of legal tender issued by the four banks at the end of June of the 29th year was 396.2 million yuan, of which gold, silver, and foreign exchange accounted for 191.7 million yuan, accounting for 48.4% of the amount issued. This amount issued increased by 50.8% compared to the same period in the 28th year, compared to an increase of 52.1% in the 28th year compared to the 27th year. Although its absolute value increased, the relative value obviously decreased, which means that although the legal tender is increasing, its trend has slowed down.

Because of the increase in the amount of legal tender issued, people who generally want to slander it will never use reason to analyze the reasons for the increase in legal tender, and suddenly say that China has inflation, but from a rational and fair standpoint, it cannot be said that China has inflation, but only that the issuance of legal tender has increased. I have the following observations:

To understand the increase in the issuance of legal tender, we must first know what the issuance of legal tender was like before the war. It has only been four and a half years since the implementation of the legal tender system. This period can be divided into two stages, pre-war and wartime, to see the trend of legal tender issuance. In imagination, the wartime should develop more rapidly than the pre-war period, but the results of statistical analysis are completely opposite. Taking November of the 24th year before the war as 100 and the month of the 26th year as 100 in wartime, then its increase process is that the first year of the war only increased by more than 20%, less than one time in two years, and less than two times in three years, while it increased by more than one time in one year before the war, and about two times in two years. It can be seen that the issuance of legal tender was cautious during the war, and the Chinese government did not increase the issuance of legal tender as a means of raising war expenses.

Trends During the War Pre-War Trends

Or, it is said that the pre-war period was when the legal tender system was being established, and the wartime legal tender system was established to attack the above comparison. Then please see the following explanation. It is undeniable that the establishment of the legal tender system was not successful during the war. What can be said to be more successful is the Southeast provinces and some provinces in the middle. The widespread use of legal tender in the Southwest and Northwest provinces occurred after the outbreak of the war. The most important example is that Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan only started to implement it effectively during the war. The Guizhou Provincial Government was still in the 27th year. In January, it issued an order to all counties requiring them to exchange all silver coins held for legal tender at the county government within three months. It can be seen that the legal tender system was still being promoted hard during the war and cannot be said to be completely successful. It is still recalled that in January of the 28th year, the Ministry of Finance also issued an order to all provincial governments strictly prohibiting the use of silver coins, and stipulated that the exchange of silver coins should increase the handling fee by 15%! (To be continued)

### Hardware: No Market for Domestic Pig Iron

Hardware transactions have been sluggish due to the hot summer season and the increased difficulty of transportation, resulting in a sharp decline in sales from all sources. The market is deserted, people's hearts are depressed, and the prices of all commodities have seen a small decline. Pig iron is no exception. The only sales channel for pig iron is the iron factory in this street, but foreign merchants also have considerable sales. However, sales from all sources have been sluggish recently. On this street, there are only inquiries. For example, Indian goods No. 1 are sold for 665 yuan, and Citibank No. 1 is sold for 875 yuan (there is no market for domestic pig iron).

### Grains Still Have Short Selling in the Rice Market Otherwise, Why Would Short Sellers Rush to Cover? This Shows Market Supervision is Just Empty Talk

Since the rice market showed tightness in the evening session the day before yesterday, when trading opened yesterday, sentiment turned firm.  Merchants and buyers were unwilling to easily let go, strongly resisting sales. Meanwhile, customers from the inland villages and local shops showed increasing interest.  Consequently, general short sellers who specialize in speculation also rushed to cover their positions.  The overall buying interest in the market suddenly surged, leading sellers to become even more confident, and prices were shouted higher and higher.  The market prices of various types of foreign rice gradually increased. As a result, the closing price was one yuan higher than the previous day. Number One Chen Saigon was priced at 55 yuan 8 jiao, 55 yuan 5 jiao. Chen Number Two was 53 yuan, 52 yuan 5 jiao. New rice was 52 yuan, 51 yuan 5 jiao. Number One Siam was 55 yuan 5 jiao, 55 yuan 2 jiao. Number Two was 51 yuan 5 jiao, 51 yuan. Fire-milled was 55 yuan, 54 yuan 5 jiao. Number One Hong Kong Point was 54 yuan 5 jiao, 54 yuan. Number Two was 52 yuan, 51 yuan 5 jiao. Number Three was 50 yuan 05 jiao, 50 yuan. Small milled point was 53 yuan. Tokyo Point was 49 yuan, down to 46 yuan 5 jiao. Rough Point was 43 yuan 5 jiao, 43 yuan. Broken Point was 42 yuan. The Number Two Siam rice shipped on the 26th was initially priced at 60 yuan 04 jiao, then quickly rose from 60 yuan 05 jiao to 61 yuan, also 7 jiao higher than the previous day. As for those shipped on the 20th, because the goods had already arrived at the port and required immediate payment, some speculative holders were eager to sell, causing the price to drop to 59 yuan at one point. However, because the Swatow merchants were still paying in cash, the final price returned to a favorable 60 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 400 tons, mainly driven by retail investors and short covering. There were also 7,000 to 8,000 transactions in spot rice.

The source of japonica and glutinous rice remained at just over a thousand bags of japonica, but sales remained sluggish regardless of official or unofficial channels. This was because the price was too high and still far from that of foreign rice. General merchants found it difficult to cope with retail sales, so the sellers attempted to compete with foreign rice by uniformly raising prices, but ultimately failed to achieve their goal, with only 3 to 5 jiao of price fluctuation. Special fresh Qing japonica from Kai Chang Province was priced at 68 yuan 5 jiao, 67 yuan. Wuxi Qing japonica was 66 yuan 5 jiao, 66 yuan. Powder japonica was 65 yuan. Changzhou Su Kun white japonica was as high as 65 yuan 5 jiao, 65 yuan. Zhongguan was 63-4 yuan. Suci was 60 yuan 5 jiao. Qing Si fresh thin rice was 66 yuan 5 jiao, 66 yuan. Da Shi was 64-5 yuan. Nangang fresh early rice was around 63 yuan, Su was 61 yuan, 60 yuan. Douchi was 59 yuan 5 jiao. Liyang fresh special yuan was 64 yuan. Jintan special yuan was around 63 yuan. Chang Dan goods were 61-2 yuan. Hong Kong white yuan was 60 yuan.

### Japanese Flour Floods the Market

Flour: Yesterday was the weekend, and spot flour transactions were quite quiet. Upon investigation, the local sales were greatly impacted by the flooding of domestic and Japanese flour in the market. Customer sales, such as those in North China and Tianjin, were mostly for foreign flour, and Japanese flour had also gradually emerged in those areas. Therefore, the Shanghai flour market has long fallen into the hands of others. Yesterday, the price of Number Two flour from the Shanghai flour factory remained at 16 yuan, with each factory selling about 5,000 bags. Transactions of other brands of flour were also rare, and prices were generally sluggish.

Wheat: Yesterday's transactions were also quiet. Because the Japanese Hongkou arrived, in addition to allocating for Japanese factories, most were put on the stacks to be sold. It was very difficult for Chinese factories to buy at low prices, so their intentions were also dimmed. Buying and selling were both in a state of support, and a formal market is still expected.

### Oil Cake Oil Market Sees Another Rebound

The oil market has declined for more than ten days since the fall. Although the market price was not violently impacted, the difference was already five or six yuan. Therefore, the general public believes that the foundation will not collapse. Therefore, various groups absorbed quite a bit in the past two days, so the price also returned to the original standard. It is estimated that 100 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded, with a price of 66 yuan. 100 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil were traded, with a price of 69 yuan. 300 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil spot goods and 500 pieces of cargo en route were traded, all at a price of 58 yuan. 150 pieces of Yantai raw oil were also priced at 58 yuan. 60 barrels of Qingdao barrel raw oil were priced at 85 yuan.

Today, 900 bags of soybeans were transported to Hong Kong, and another 2,790 bags were transported to Singapore. 2,000 pieces of bean cake were transported to Hong Kong, and 1,330 bags of raw peanuts were transported to Hong Kong, and another 100 bags were transported to Singapore.

### Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Has Many Floating Positions, Many Closing at a Loss Shuang Ma Down Over One Yuan

The yarn market continued to decline, and the downward trend was roundabout. This was because the actual sales were too narrow, coupled with the instability of the situation in eastern Zhejiang, which led to a weakening of public confidence. This situation made many multi-positions uneasy. The floating positions in such an environment were slightly reduced at a loss, but the amount absorbed by the general large households remained unmoved. Therefore, transactions in the market became increasingly quiet, and there was a sense of dispersal.

When the spot yarn market opened in the morning, due to the military tension in Ningbo Zhenhai, most people were suspicious, and buyers lacked interest. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma was 920 yuan, opening slightly more than ten yuan lower. Later, with the encouragement of many parties, it rebounded to 928 yuan. However, the spot yarn business was sparse, and the overall situation was again relaxed. The market price went down again, falling to 917 yuan. At the closing time, the gold price rebounded, pulling up one step to a price of 920 yuan. The statistics for transactions in the half-day totaled 1,370 bales, and the market price referred to Shuang Ma at 21 yuan. Today, 80 pieces of yarn will be shipped to Haikou, and another 940 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong. The amounts bought by various groups are listed as follows:

Same industry: 1,160 Hong Kong: 210

Total: 1,370

Cotton Market Difficult to Expect Progress

Spot cotton transactions are still ordinary. This is because yarn sales are declining and market prices are falling, so factory appetites are not healthy. However, there are some transactions for delivery, and there are some transactions, but it cannot affect the overall situation, so the market is still lacking in color. In addition, overseas cotton markets are still in a slump, and people's confidence is still difficult to boost. Da Zhong Ji is 190 yuan, with 180 bales traded. American cotton is 260 yuan, with 200 pieces traded.

### Sugar Market Customs Gold Increases, Foreign Sugar Follows Up

Yesterday's sugar market saw a sudden increase in the customs gold unit, which was originally 2.708, but is now changed to 2.877, resulting in an increase of 9 jiao per picul for white sugar tax and 6 jiao for brown sugar, so the trend followed tightly. The guild divided the spot goods into 24 rough whites, with the price in the local stack at 68 yuan to 68 yuan, an increase of one yuan. The price in the foreign stack was initially 66 yuan 9 jiao to 67 yuan, and then rose to 67 yuan 5 jiao to 8 jiao. In the afternoon, it was 66 yuan to 68 yuan 2 jiao, an increase of one yuan and two jiao. As for re-exported goods, because the customs duties were not included, there was not much fluctuation, with the morning price at 52 yuan 9 jiao to 7 jiao 5 fen, and the afternoon price at 53 yuan. Delivery in 30 days was 53 yuan 3 jiao. Taikoo Car White B Mark West Stack was 77 yuan 5 jiao to 78 yuan, an increase of one yuan and five jiao, HX Mark was 75 yuan 5 jiao, an increase of five jiao, and the local factory's snow white was 68 yuan 5 jiao, an increase of one yuan. The local Number One Ice was 90 yuan, and Ming Ice was 91 yuan 5 jiao, an increase of half a yuan. The national factory had Guangbang offering more than a hundred bags of Dongxiang red, at 52 yuan to 52 yuan 5 jiao.

### Piece Goods Demand from Guangdong and Hong Kong is Increasing

National Cloth: Yesterday's market saw that the coastal areas were blockaded, the situation in Zhenhai was urgent, and sales in Zhejiang were difficult to resume for a while. However, demand from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Yantai increased, and the market situation was still stable. The selling price of white cloth and bleached fabric was slightly reduced by 2 jiao 5 fen to 5 jiao per bolt. The Yantai merchants purchased nearly 200 pieces of colored cloth and bleached coarse cloth. The Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants purchased more than 300 pieces of coarse cloth, coarse twill, fine twill, and colored cloth. Inland merchants from Ningbo, Wuhu, and other places purchased more than 5,000 pieces and 200 pieces of fine cloth and colored cloth.

Eastern Cloth: Transactions were sluggish, and the price drop was again pronounced. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth new stack dropped to 28 yuan 4 jiao per piece, while the old stack was only 27 yuan 5 jiao, a decrease of about one yuan per piece. The smallest sale of Four Gentlemen serge opened at 8 jiao 4 and a half fen per yard, and the market atmosphere was very sluggish.

### Abundant White Serge Falling Prices Still Lack Buyers

The woolen market has continued to be sluggish in recent days. Both local and customer demand is weak. Retail and wholesale transactions are also clear. The mainstream standard market price is clearly stable and secretly loose. The old brand of Abundant blue-edged white serge has fallen quite heavily. If there are actual buyers for the original piece now, the seller is willing to make concessions to sell it off, selling it for only 28 yuan 5 jiao per yard. Retail sales in stores are also sold for no more than 29 yuan and 29 yuan 5 jiao. Based on the delayed arrival at the port, the supply exceeds the demand, and the actual sales are overdue. They are deeply afraid that the price of goods next summer will be difficult to reach the current high. Both buyers and sellers are aware of this, which makes the market atmosphere worse. Although it has fallen by several yuan a yard, there is still no way out.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Efforts to Eliminate Political Assassinations; Chairman Urges Leading Consuls to Take Notice; Requests Convening of Consular Body Meeting to Seek Cooperation

The Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Keswick, sent a letter to the Danish Consul General and Leading Consul today (20th), which stated in brief: "I am deeply shocked by the sudden assassination of Mr. Zhang Sixu, Director of the Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, in the Public Concession. Four days ago, the Shen Bao newspaper office was bombed, resulting in one death and multiple injuries. Furthermore, on the evening of the 28th of last month, the president of the Guomin Xinwen [National News] newspaper was assassinated on Fujian Road. Prior to the latter case, the newspaper had received threatening letters stating that if they continued to support certain policies, severe measures would be taken against them. Moreover, it was reported on the 16th of this month that the Nanjing Chinese government had requested seven foreign journalists to leave Shanghai, and Mr. Allman, the publisher of the Shen Bao, was one of them. I have no knowledge as to whether this report is accurate. Furthermore, Mr. Zhang Sixu, who was assassinated, was among the 83 people listed as wanted by the Nanjing Chinese government in the Zhonghua Ribao [China Daily]. While Mr. Zhang's assassination may not be related to the publication of this report, it undoubtedly gives cause for concern.

Shanghai Becoming a Zone of Sacrifice

This Council and its Police Department have been making every effort to suppress terrorist incidents, as you are aware. However, if political factions are allowed to continue committing armed crimes to achieve their goals, the Council and the Police Department will not be able to succeed. This Council expresses its regret for criminal acts, regardless of their method, motive, or perpetrator. In the past, the Public Concession could be considered a place where public order was reasonably maintained, and those in charge were able to find ways to reduce crime and maintain tranquility. However, with the current irreconcilable factions exerting all their efforts to achieve their goals, Shanghai is becoming a zone of sacrifice. In this time of global turmoil, I sincerely hope that Shanghai can become a place where people can live and work in peace.

Request to Convene Consular Body Meeting

I firmly believe that no responsible person can condone the use of assassination as a weapon. As the Chairman of this Council, I cannot remain silent in my position. Therefore, I am writing to you about this regrettable situation and also sending copies of this letter to newspapers for publication. I urge you to convene a meeting of the Consular Body as soon as possible and to encourage all consuls to cooperate with this Council so that these political assassinations, which undermine all confidence and damage Shanghai's international reputation, can be stopped."

### Labor Strike at the British-owned Shanghai Gas Co. Remains Stalled

The entire workforce at the Yu Qiaqing Road factory of the British-owned Shanghai Gas Co. submitted a request to the company several days ago for improved treatment. This was rejected by the company, and a work slowdown subsequently occurred. The slowdown continued until yesterday. According to an investigation by a reporter from the Pingmin She [Common People's Society], the company's attitude is firm, and it has rejected all of the workers' demands, stating that there is no room for negotiation. The company has given the workers a deadline of 7:00 AM on the 22nd to resume work, otherwise they will be considered to have resigned voluntarily. The labor side is still insisting on its original demands, resulting in a stalemate between the two sides. According to workers speaking to the reporter, the company had increased wages by 7.5% during the coronation of King George VI in 1936. Unexpectedly, the factory stopped paying this wage increase last month. The current demands include a request that the factory resume paying it.

### Filipinos Concerned About Independence Issue; Eagerly Awaiting U.S. Assistance

Filipino businessman Mr. Areneta arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the President Adams. He told reporters that Filipinos are deeply concerned about the fact that national defense will no longer exist when the Tydings–McDuffie Act expires in 1946. However, any proposal to delay full independence must come from the United States. Filipinos previously

Fought for Independence for National Dignity

But today's world situation is different from the past. Aggressor nations are filled with insatiable desires. Therefore, Filipinos are temporarily unwilling to be independent, lest independence be gained and then lost, and they be devoured by aggressor nations. Our pursuit of freedom is not a temporary measure. Therefore, if the U.S. government proposes to

Delay Independence

We will not object. But such a proposal must be made by 1946. If not, Filipinos will be in a difficult position, because Filipinos cannot propose a delay in independence themselves. According to the businessman's prediction, the Tydings-McDuffie Act may not be cancelled at that time, but only

Amended

To give Filipinos full autonomy, but U.S. armed forces will still be stationed in the Philippine Islands. This expedient measure will be beneficial to both the United States and the Philippines. If the Philippines does not have the United States, its national defense will be lost, and if the United States does not have the Philippines, its trade in the Far East will lose its foothold.

### Fifth Column of Japanese Active in Hong Kong

Passengers who arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday aboard the President Adams told the reporter that Hong Kong residents fear the activities of the Japanese-led "fifth column" more than a blockade or armed invasion. Japanese troops are gathering around Hong Kong, and if the political situation in the Far East continues to deteriorate, it could easily lead to terrorist acts in the city. The Hong Kong authorities seem to be making considerable preparations for this possible development. Currently, businesses in Hong Kong that are purely engaged in local trade have been hit hard by the evacuation of British women and children and the departure of some Chinese residents.

### Residence of New York Times Reporter Searched by Japanese Yesterday; Two Masked Men Used Weapons to Inflict Abuse; Many Precious Manuscripts Were Taken Away; U.S. Consul to Lodge Protest

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that Mr. A.T. Steele, the Far East Bureau Chief for the New York Times, was brutally beaten by two masked and armed Japanese men in his apartment on the 16th floor of the Broadway Mansions shortly after midnight today (20th). His hands were twisted behind his back by the Japanese, forcing him to open drawers. An unfinished manuscript of a book by Mr. Steele on General Frederick Townsend Ward, the first American to come to China, was taken. This morning, Mr. Steele reported the details of the incident to the U.S. Consulate. According to Mr. Patrick, the Acting Consul General of the United States in Shanghai, he received a letter from Mr. Steele stating that the U.S. Consul will lodge a strong protest with the Japanese authorities regarding this matter. Japanese officials said this morning that they are investigating the attack. Mr. Tsurumi Ken, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, who also lives in the Broadway Mansions, responded to the call after Mr. Steele was attacked and went to see him. This morning, Mr. Tsurumi Ken claimed that he was deeply distressed by the matter and that the Japanese authorities have stepped up their investigation. A summary of the incident is as follows:

Dog Barks, Strange Guests Suddenly Arrive

Shortly after midnight, Mr. Steele was in his apartment in the Broadway Mansions, reviewing newspaper articles while in bed, when he suddenly heard his dog barking. Then he heard a knock on the door. Mr. Steele got up to answer the door and saw two Japanese men standing outside in plain clothes, their faces covered with handkerchiefs, each holding a handgun. One was tall and wearing a gray shirt, while the other was short and bow-legged, wearing a dark green top and rather untidy trousers. Each wore a cheap straw hat and rubber tennis shoes.

Telephone Line Forcibly Cut

The two Japanese men burst into Mr. Steele's apartment in the living room, immediately closed the door, and one of them forcibly cut the telephone line on the wall. The other Japanese man kicked Mr. Steele's dog. Both Japanese men spoke fluent English. They asked Mr. Steele for the manuscript of the "anti-Japanese book" he was writing. Mr. Steele replied that he was not engaged in such work. One of the Japanese men pointed a gun at Mr. Steele and ordered him to lead them to his office. Mr. Steele had no choice but to comply.

One Person Watches, The Other Searches for the Manuscript

After turning on the light, the shorter Japanese man watched Mr. Steele, while the other Japanese man searched through the papers on his desk. He found Mr. Steele's nearly completed book manuscript on the life of General Frederick Townsend Ward. Mr. Steele explained that this was a record of historical events, and the person he was writing about had died nearly 80 years ago. However, the taller Japanese man reviewed the manuscript and found that the first page mentioned Japan, with words such as the repeated battles at the mouth of the Yangtze River before 1937. And on the last few pages, he found a record of the destruction of General Ward's tomb in Songjiang by Japanese soldiers.

Accused of Insult, Forced to Kneel

The Japanese man then roared that Mr. Steele was insulting the Japanese army and struck Mr. Steele on the left side of his head, causing Mr. Steele's glasses to fall off. Then he grabbed his left hand, twisted it behind his back, and forced Mr. Steele to kneel. After the two Japanese men spoke to each other in Japanese, they ordered Mr. Steele to show them the "telegram he sent attacking General Miura." Mr. Steele said that if he had sent such a telegram, they could check the draft of the telegram as proof. The two Japanese men then searched again at will, even the boxes in the bedroom were not spared.

Seized the Manuscript and Left

After finding nine short manuscripts, they finally carried them back to the living room along with the original and duplicate manuscripts of the book on General Ward. They warned Mr. Steele that if he called the police within ten minutes, they would shoot him. After saying this, they strode away. Mr. Steele did not hear the elevator go up, so the two Japanese men probably went down the stairs.

Called the Police After a While, No Trace

After a while, Mr. Steele called the police, and everyone in the building knew. But the perpetrators were not caught, because the building has six entrances and exits, and there are many Japanese residents. The two Japanese men may have left the building separately or hid in the apartments of Japanese residents in the building. The two handkerchiefs that covered their faces were abandoned on the stairs.

Nine Months of Effort Will Be Lost

According to Mr. Steele, he had a contract with the New York Duran Company to write a book about General Ward, and he had already received an advance of US$500. He would receive another $500 upon submission of the manuscript. The contract is still in Mr. Steele's safe. The stolen manuscript totaled 354 pages, about 106,000 words. He has been working on the book for nine months. If it cannot be returned, nine months of effort will be lost, or he will have to return the $500 advance.

The Value of Nine Short Manuscripts is Hard to Estimate

Moreover, he has spent more than 800 yuan in legal currency on consulting old books and taking photos for writing this book. As for the value of the nine stolen short manuscripts, it is even more difficult to determine. According to his New York agency, a Hollywood film company is eager to buy the film rights to the book about General Ward.

### The French Tramway Labor Strike Resolved; Workers Resumed Work This Morning; More Than 100 People Returned to the Factory to Work Last Night; The Iron Gates in the French Concession Can Now Be Fully Opened

The labor strike by 700 coppersmith workers at the French-owned Tramway Company, which had lasted for five days, began to show signs of resolution yesterday morning. From the beginning, the company had maintained contact with the workers in order to find a solution. Yesterday morning, the workers' representatives held another round of negotiations with the company, and the two sides' opinions had become closer. An agreement was about to be reached. Yesterday afternoon, after further mediation by the French Consul General, all the problems were solved smoothly. The workers' representatives were satisfied, and around 100 of the workers had already returned to the factory to resume work by 7:30 PM last night. It is hoped that all 700 members of the mechanical affairs department will return to the factory to work at around 6:00 AM this morning. The work slowdown that had lasted for several days has now come to an end. It was later learned that the police had dispatched two armored vehicles to the front of the company, which had been withdrawn to the police station, leaving only a few patrolmen to guard the perimeter of the company.

The Qiu Xin Labor Strike Has Not Been Resolved

The entire workforce of the French-owned Qiu Xin Machinery and Shipbuilding Factory on Shanghai Army Camp Factory Street in the South City responded in unison to join the strike on the 18th to show their support for the demands of the French-owned water and electricity workers. They also demanded an increase in rice subsidies, as the factory's wages were lower than those of any other factory in the same industry. As of the 20th, the matter had not been resolved. The factory stated that it had increased wages by 40% per month and rice subsidies of 18 yuan per person since June 4th, so it would be difficult to accept the current strike. It posted a notice on the 19th instructing all workers to resume work immediately, otherwise the factory would end its payments to the workers by the end of July.

Work at the Water Plant Was Not Interrupted

The French-owned Water Company on Shanghai Army Camp Factory Street in the South City has a section in its machine room that specializes in drawing water from the Huangpu River to the Lujiawan headquarters, supplying users throughout the French Concession. After the water and electricity workers went on strike, the work in the machine room was taken over by two French engineers. However, starting yesterday, several White Russians were temporarily hired to join the work in order to maintain the supply of important water materials.

Two Iron Gates Were Opened Yesterday Afternoon

Because the opinions of the French Tramway Company and its workers were getting closer, the seriousness of the labor strike gradually decreased. Therefore, the security in the French Concession became more relaxed yesterday. The two iron gates at the intersection of Xin Kaihe Road and Henan South Road were reopened at noon yesterday. Other iron gates remained closed as before, but it was heard that they would all be opened today.

### The Tjitjalengka Ship Will Depart Today

According to reliable sources in the shipping industry, the Tjitjalengka, a ship owned by the Java-China-Japan Lijn shipping company that sails to Southeast Asia, Java, and Hong Kong, was originally scheduled to depart yesterday after arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday. However, the departure was postponed due to the strike by the dockworkers who load and unload cargo on the ship. The ship has now been rescheduled to depart today.

### A Man Proposed Marriage to a Woman, but Suddenly Announced the Termination of the Engagement; The Woman Asked the Court to Rule the Engagement Valid; The Judge Instructed Both Parties to Go Outside and Reconcile

Wang Shuzhen, a 24-year-old woman from Zhenhai, who lives at No. 203 Luban Road and works as a doctor at the Far Eastern Hospital, recently hired lawyers Ge Zhitan and Sun Deji to represent her in filing a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against her fiancé, Zhang Zuxun (21 years old, local, residing at No. 195, Lane 1218, Route Lafayette, working as a partner at Heyuan Sugar Firm, No. 19 Foreign Firm Street), requesting that the engagement be declared valid. The complaint stated that the woman met the defendant in September of the 25th year of the Republic of China through the introduction of Ying Jinlong. After that,

letters were exchanged and they visited each other from time to time. In the spring of the 26th year of the Republic of China, the defendant expressed his intention to propose marriage. The woman refused, saying that both parties were still young, but the defendant's letters later expressed extreme affection. On the one hand, he entrusted Ye Qingyuan and Ying Jinlong to discuss the matter with the woman's mother. The woman also deeply believed his words, "My admiration for my sister comes from sincerity. My desire to be her lifelong companion also comes from sincerity. How can it be considered passive?" and finally agreed. Therefore, on June 2, in the 26th year of the Republic of China, they

entered into an engagement. On May 27 of this year, she suddenly received a letter from lawyer Yu Bingwen on behalf of the defendant, stating that the engagement was arranged by his parents and was not his own decision, and announcing the termination of the engagement. The engagement in this case was purely the defendant's own decision. Even though the defendant was not yet of age, he had reached the age for engagement, and it was also his own decision, with the consent of his parents. This engagement was legally established and should not be

terminated without reason. The woman hired a lawyer to send a letter of rebuttal, but the defendant dared to misquote Article 975 of the Civil Code and published a notice in the newspaper announcing the termination of the engagement. Whether the engagement can be fulfilled is one matter, and whether it should be terminated is another. They should not be confused. A woman's reputation is important, and it is not easy to remarry. The defendant has other plans and disregards morality, claiming termination out of thin air. How can this be tolerated? Therefore, she filed a lawsuit requesting that

the established engagement be declared valid. Yesterday morning, the court accepted the complaint, and Judge Tan Hao presided over the trial in the Fifth Civil Court. The defendant hired lawyers Li Baosen and Yu Bingwen to

present a defense, saying that the plaintiff had made five demands:

(1) A monthly living allowance of 200 yuan; (2) Not to return to his ancestral home in Pudong; (3) To separate from his parents; (4) Not to interfere with the plaintiff wearing modern clothes; (5) The plaintiff to be in charge of all household affairs. Therefore, he could not accept and requested the termination of the engagement. The plaintiff admitted to making one demand, which was that the current cost of living is extremely high, and the defendant must have a monthly salary of 200 yuan in order to marry. Now that both parties are adults, they requested the court to approve the validity of the engagement. The court immediately advised both parties to go outside and attempt reconciliation, and announced that the hearing would be postponed to the third of next month.

### Robbing American Soldiers' Salary; Sentenced to Three Years in Prison

At 10:45 AM on October 21st last year, the American barracks on Xiaoshadu Road issued pay.

They confessed that Zhao Guisheng (also known as Thirtyzi), a Jiangbei man who was the inside man in the barracks, was the informant. After the incident, Xu Decheng, a Chinese detective from the Gordon Road Police Station, investigated and arrested them, and brought them to the First Special District Court. After the interrogation was completed, they awaited sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the Third Criminal Court and sentenced Zhao Guisheng to three years in prison as a warning.

### Deceased Shareholder of Ruichang Hardware Store: Concubine and Legal Wife Involved in Lawsuit; After Qian's Death, All Assets Managed by the Concubine; Legal Wife Sues for Embezzlement and Demands Return

The late Yong native, Qian Yiying, was a shareholder of Ruichang Hardware Store. During his lifetime, because his legal wife, Chen, only gave birth to one daughter, Ruilan, he adopted Wang, a fellow villager, as his second wife in order to have an heir. She gave birth to one son and two daughters. Later, the legal wife, Chen, passed away, and Qian began an affair with Ren, a fellow villager, at No. 26, 3rd floor, Dali Public, No. 14 Xinyong'an Street. Later, due to the outbreak of the war, Wang and her children

sought refuge in Shanghai from their hometown, temporarily residing at No. 73 Taianli, Beishaxi Road. Unfortunately, Qian passed away from illness in Shanghai on November 12th of last year. All his assets were managed by his concubine, Ren. The legal wife, Wang, and her children requested Ren to divide the assets, but Ren presented a will made by Qian before his death, refusing to hand them over for distribution. Wang, seeing that negotiations were ineffective, hired lawyer Chen Wencan to represent her in filing a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against Ren, requesting that Qian's

assets be handed over and inventoried, and requesting a judgment ordering that the 1,200 yuan in shares of Ruichang Hardware Store, the 8,900 yuan in deposits at Yudada Heng Sugar Firm, the 600 yuan in deposits at Fei Wenyuan Silver Store, and the 20.5 mu of land and three houses in Longjiang Jjia be handed over for distribution. As a result, Judge Ma ruled that Qian Ren should hand over the inventory of Qian Yiying's assets to Qian Wang. Recently, Qian Wang, in her capacity as legal representative, along with her children Qian Qichang, Qian Xueqin, and Qian Wenxian, again hired lawyer Chen to

file a criminal complaint in the Criminal Court against Ren, Wang Guixiang (accountant at Yudada Heng Sugar Firm, No. 44 Xiaodongmen Road), and Qian Qi (manager of Ruichang Hardware Store, No. 12 Xinyong'an Street) for embezzlement. The court accepted the complaint, and Judge Yuan opened the trial yesterday morning. According to the plaintiffs, the defendant Ren, knowing that Qian Yiying was already 66 years old last year and that he was seriously ill and unlikely to recover, colluded with Wang Guixiang and Qian Qi to concoct an illegal will and withdraw Qian's deposits and shares in Shanghai,

committing embezzlement, violating Article 335-31 of the Criminal Code. They requested that they be punished accordingly and filed a civil lawsuit requesting the return of all Qian's deposits during his lifetime. The defendants hired lawyers Yuan Hanyun, Xiao Baichuan, and Wang Xiuqing to defend them, fiercely disputing the identities of the parties involved and insisting that there was no embezzlement based on the deceased's will, and requested that they be declared not guilty. The court immediately advised both parties to attempt reconciliation and announced that the hearing would be postponed to the 30th. The three defendants each provided a reputable shop as bail, and were allowed to be temporarily released on bail by their defense lawyers.

### White Russian Art World Election: Shanghai Miss

Dalu News reports that the beauty queen contest organized by the Shanghai White Russian Artists Association began at the Acadey Ballroom on Thursday evening and ended on the morning of the 19th, and was quite lively. The judges included female poet Ms. Anderson, Sir Sassoon, journalists, and members of the White Russian Artists Association. A total of eleven young women participated in the competition.

Ms. Haberle and Ms. Vaplonoskaja were also selected, each receiving a bouquet of flowers. This type of competition is held once a year and aims to raise funds for charitable purposes. However, only White Russian girls participated in the competition, so it would be more appropriate to call it the "Avenue Joffre Miss Beauty Contest."

### Serious Social Problems: Special Report from Jiang Junsun's Contraception Clinic

Since the start of the war, this city has become a special area. Although the market is prosperous, its degree is even greater than before the war. However, all are abnormal phenomena, which is different from normal development. Therefore, even if the surface is bustling and remains the same as in previous years, the actual situation of the lives of citizens is that they are almost overwhelmed with pain. In recent months, the international situation has been turbulent. The general situation in Shanghai is even more turbulent, and families who live on monthly salaries are more seriously threatened in this environment. Fortunately, those with few children can barely manage. However, if they have frequent births and many mouths to feed, it will be difficult for them to be parents.

We often see people burdened by their children, running around all day for food and clothing, but still not enough for their lowest standard of living. They have no extra energy to provide education for their children. If children do not have good upbringing, their future harvests can also be known. If it is not remedied, it will affect the future of the nation. Dr. Jiang Junsun, who studied medicine in Germany and has been practicing medicine in Shanghai for nearly twenty years, believes that the above problems are important, so he specially founded a contraception clinic at No. 12, Lane 483, Chengdu Road (phone 36688), to adjust fertility and do his best. Dr. Jiang has sophisticated knowledge and uses G's scientific principles to implement contraception therapy, which is painless, can restore fertility at any time, and has no effect on menstruation or libido. It is indeed the most scientific and economical contraception method in modern times, which greatly benefits the lower middle class. This not only reduces the burden on families, but also allows their existing children to receive considerable education and training, creating a foundation for future happiness. As for the mother, it avoids the depletion of multiple births and maintains health and happiness, the benefits of which are difficult to describe.

It has been shown that the infant mortality rate in this city in the past three years is truly alarming. At the ends of alleys, the corpses of infants abandoned by their parents are often found. Although these tragic phenomena are said to be caused by the environment, they are ultimately a shame to conscience and morality. The only way to prevent it is to control fertility. What other way is there? The reporter feels that Dr. Jiang is able to fundamentally consider the society and the country, so he wrote this article. Those who are burdened by their children should not ignore contraception.

### The Issue of a Third Term for the US President

"This war is not an ordinary war, but a revolution of force, threatening people everywhere. This revolution does not seek to liberate humanity, but to enslave it… My conscience cannot ignore the call of the people… If the American people call upon me through a free election, I can simply declare that with God's help, I will do my best to continue to serve." This is President Roosevelt's important statement after the Democratic National Convention nominated him as a presidential candidate.

The issue of a third term for the US president has been debated for a long time. Examining American history, the founding father Washington did not oppose a president serving a long term, as generally believed. His successor, Jefferson, the founder of the Democratic Party, firmly opposed a third term for the president, and made Washington's refusal of a third term a convention. Washington secretly opposed including a clause in the US Constitution limiting the number of consecutive terms for the president at the Constitutional Convention. Jefferson, who was in France at the time, argued that the US president should be limited to one term. Other representatives argued that elections should be held every three years, with no restrictions on re-election, while others argued that the president's term should be set at seven years and not be re-elected. In the end, the Constitution stipulated that the president's term was four years, and all proposals to restrict re-election were rejected.

According to another opinion, Washington had no intention of serving as the first president, but he reluctantly did so in order to get the new government on track. He was even less willing to serve a second term, but had to seek re-election due to the international situation at the time. At the end of his eventful second term, he was extremely tired and deeply wished to return to his hometown of Mount Vernon to live a quiet life.

Jefferson's opposition to a second term was even more outspoken than Washington's unwillingness to serve a third term. In a letter to Madison in 1787, he lamented the failure of the Constitution Drafting Committee to stipulate the number of consecutive terms for the president. During his second term as president, eight state legislatures supported him running for a third term. He refused in private letters and declared that the president's term should not exceed eight years. He wrote to the North Carolina legislature: "I am unwilling to be the first to disregard the good example set by the glorious predecessors and seek a third term as president." However, after his retirement, he still held a powerful position behind the scenes in the elections of his successors, Presidents Madison and Monroe.

Since then, the issue of a third term has not become a serious problem. Some presidents even died of overwork before completing their first term. There have also been many proposals to amend the Constitution to limit the number of terms a president can serve. Jackson argued that the president's term should be six years and not be re-elected. However, various amendments have not been established. It was not until the era of Grant, a century after the founding of the country, that the old issue was raised again, but it was only a flash in the pan.

Until the era of Theodore Roosevelt, the issue of a third term for the president arose again. After McKinley was assassinated, Theodore Roosevelt completed the late president's unexpired term and was re-elected once, but he was unwilling to be a candidate for a third term. However, four years later, because he was dissatisfied with the policies of his successor, Taft, he asked the Republican National Convention to nominate him as a candidate. He said: "His previous opposition to a third term referred to serving three consecutive terms." After his request failed, he organized the Progressive Republican Party and ran for election. The three-way presidential election campaign at the time was extremely fierce, resulting in a split in the Republican Party and the election of the Democratic candidate Wilson. However, he received 4,126,020 votes, while Taft received only 3,483,922 votes. Wilson received 6,286,214 votes, more than one million votes less than the Republican Party combined.

Harding died in his first term, and Coolidge succeeded him, completing his first term, and was elected again in 1924 for a second term. After Coolidge was elected to a second term, the issue of a third term arose again. But on August 2, 1917, he declared that he would not be a candidate for president again in 1928. His true intentions were speculated for several months afterward. Most people admitted that he had no intention of running again and that it was the truth. By 1928, the Senate had passed the La Follette Bill by a majority of 56 to 26, calling a third term for the president "an unwise, unpatriotic, and dangerous move."

As for the current issue of President Roosevelt's third term, after he was sworn in for re-election in 1937, the American political world began to discuss what he would do after his term expired. It is difficult to imagine such an active and accomplished figure retiring to the forest and simply ending his days as a "local gentleman of Hyde Park." Over time, the issue of a third term was mentioned, and as the European war changed dramatically, this subtle issue in American history gradually formed a crystallization of public opinion.

However, President Roosevelt himself has always remained silent on this issue over the years, until Senator Barkley read out a 146-word statement on his behalf at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago at 11:18 PM on the 18th of this month. The main point was: "The President has no intention of seeking a third term, or of being nominated as a candidate by this convention, and that is so today as it was in the past. It is hoped that the delegates to this convention will freely nominate any candidate." This open and aboveboard attitude means that if public opinion unanimously supports him through a free election, he will naturally not hesitate to serve the country and the world.

Upon receiving this news, the convention nominated him as a candidate by a very large majority, like being struck by lightning, to oppose the Republican candidate Wilkie. President Roosevelt then directly expressed his acceptance to the convention via radio. This historical issue has thus come to an end, and it can be predicted that when the American people hold a general election in November, Roosevelt will most likely be elected for re-election.

### Ribbentrop and Molotov (End)

— En

German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop everywhere carries the air of an Englishman. He can be said to be the first British-style German diplomat. Even in terms of physical constitution—tall stature, blond hair and blue eyes, an open face, fit and well-dressed—he could easily pass for an Eton-educated British politician. When speaking, with measured pace and few unnecessary gestures, he possesses the unshakeable and gracefully humble demeanor of the most superior politician at 10 Downing Street in London.

Some describe Ribbentrop as a complete German traveling salesman, but this is only partially correct. He has a knack for fitting into any society, whether it's English, French, or even Russian. He speaks their languages fluently and effortlessly imitates various accents to suit the occasion. As for the number of "tricks" and the brilliance of his conversation, even the gentry and nobility can consider him one of their own. But the talents that make up such a "top-notch" salesman are not German at all. To be precise, Ribbentrop is pieced together from the different manners of various countries; he is a British-style diplomat, mixed with the concise and capable talent of a Parisian hotelier.

Ribbentrop was born in 1893 in a small town in Germany, and his family was middle class. He obtained his noble title through adoption by an uncle who held a prominent position in the army. His early education was not systematic. As a child, he attended schools in Switzerland, French private schools, and British universities. In fact, he never graduated from secondary school or university, and he was quite lax in his studies. However, he is worldly and has a keen understanding. His appearance and ability to cope make it clear at first glance that he is a capable person. The only subject he is proficient in is geography. His understanding of history is only a general outline. On the other hand, he is an expert in business.

Around the age of twenty, he lived in Canada for three years, which had a significant impact on his character. He worked as a foreman in a construction company there, during which time he learned how to deal with subordinates. He is inherently romantic or adventurous. When he received news of the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he became restless and eventually tried all sorts of disguises, and with his proficiency in various languages, he seized the opportunity to return to Germany. But his actual days of combat were very short. Because of his familiarity with the situation in the Americas, he was assigned to the staff headquarters. He was then transferred to the German Embassy in the United States, traveling from Germany by submarine to New York and then to Washington, D.C. His superior was Franz von Papen, the military attaché to Ambassador Bernstorff. Well-informed sources say that Papen's instigation of labor unrest in the United States and Canada was planned behind the scenes by Ribbentrop. In any case, before the United States entered the war, he undoubtedly did or directed many espionage activities. Papen was very satisfied with Ribbentrop's assistance, and even when he was transferred to become the ambassador to Turkey, he asked "Ali" for help.

When the last European war ended, Ribbentrop's espionage work also came to an end. He had no place in the democratic German government. In the years that followed, he did some work to supplement his personal finances. He worked as a salesman for a famous French champagne company, and because of his excellent performance, Hengel, the owner of Germany's largest champagne factory, not only appointed him as the sales director but also made him his son-in-law.

After becoming a wealthy and successful businessman, Ribbentrop wanted to abandon business for politics and join political conspiracies, and became connected with Hitler. At that time, Hitler, although not completely invisible on the German political chessboard, was still a dim horse. But the heir to Hengel's millions did not participate in the Nazi Party's activities at this time. He only tried to get close to Germany's future leader, financially supporting the Nazi Party and maintaining close ties with the core members of the party.

It was Ribbentrop who brought together Papen and Hitler during the coup in January 1932. He also paved the way for Hitler to accept President Hindenburg's order to form a cabinet. He had leaked news to Papen that once Hitler gained power, the position of foreign minister would have to rely on Papen. Months after Hitler took office, Ribbentrop was appointed as a member of the Disarmament Committee, and soon after as the head of the Nazi Party's foreign affairs department. This former champagne salesman completely took control of the Nazi Party's foreign policy and did not take the then nominally German Foreign Minister Neurath seriously. His promise to Papen had "vanished with the wind."

It is now generally accepted that Ribbentrop was the planner of Hitler's policy towards England. When he served as the ambassador to England in 1936, he became very friendly with key figures in British political circles. His first major contribution to diplomacy with England began in the spring of 1938. At that time, he visited London as the dazzling German Foreign Minister, detaining Lord Halifax for two days, so that the Austrian Ambassador to England had no way to contact the British Foreign Minister. During this time, German troops had already entered Austrian territory. Ribbentrop repeatedly discussed German diplomacy with Halifax. When this smokescreen cleared and Halifax regained consciousness, Hitler had become the master of Austria.

Four years ago, one rainy afternoon in London, when the League of Nations Council was judging the issue of the German army reoccupying the Rhineland, Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov openly turned away from Ribbentrop, who was speaking on behalf of Hitler, and read the newspaper while muttering to himself. Ribbentrop flushed with embarrassment, but after giving this communist opponent a disdainful look, he continued his speech. Ribbentrop kept this incident in mind. Last summer, when he flew to Moscow to sign the Soviet-Russian agreement, he greeted Molotov with a smile, asking about the whereabouts of the retired Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov, and meaningfully praised that the two of them, Ribbentrop and Molotov, would of course have no difficulty in "now" seeking mutual understanding.

Molotov and Ribbentrop were quite able to understand each other. Molotov once said to Stalin that the Communist Party and sympathizers around the world would certainly agree with the signing of an agreement between the Soviet Union and the Nazi Party, the master of Central Europe. Ribbentrop also assured Hitler that the German-Soviet agreement would prevent Britain from interfering with Germany's invasion of Poland. These two diplomats must have felt that under normal dictatorial circumstances, if either side miscalculated, both sides would be in danger of bankruptcy.

The Hercules-like Soviet Russian Foreign Minister and the handsome salesman of German Nazi foreign policy were clearly not afraid of their bosses. Molotov's office was connected to Stalin's, but newspaper reporters all said that Stalin often went to Molotov's office in person. On the other hand, the German Foreign Minister was the one with whom Hitler "discussed" diplomatic matters yesterday. General Göring often expressed resentment towards the surge in power of this "savage in the Nazi Party." We don't need to speculate on whether Stalin and Hitler were puppets of each other. It would be more intimate and interesting to ask whether the two of them had become the "toys" of Molotov and Ribbentrop.

Ancient Methods of Locust Control (2)

According to records, locusts belong to the category of pests. The Erya Interpretation of Poetry distinguishes between those that eat the heart of seedlings, those that eat leaves, those that eat joints, and those that eat roots. Nowadays, the common people do not have time to distinguish them, and all are called locusts. The customs of the ancients were simple and honest. The odes in the Book of Poetry seem to indicate that the people themselves eliminated them. Therefore, on the day of reporting and paying field rents, they prayed to seek help. It is not heard that the authorities eliminated the harm for the people. The Spring and Autumn Annals record disasters and anomalies, and mentions the moth, but the commentary does not detail methods of catching and eliminating them. In later generations, the thorough taxation method was not implemented, and taxes were levied on the land. Even with minor disasters or crop failures, officials did not report them and continued to collect taxes as usual. Therefore, once farmland suffered harm, the people feared that the authorities would not know, so they rushed to report in droves. Whether it was drought, prolonged rain, river breaches, or hail damage, all were reported in detail. As a result, the disasters that the people should have eliminated themselves became the responsibility that officials dared not refuse. Therefore, they banned slaughter, set up altars, surveyed waterways, and reinforced dikes, laboring tirelessly throughout the year without rest. The most anxiety-inducing and difficult to reverse was locusts. I secretly believe that the ancients acted in a way that could grasp the essentials for planning. After detailed analysis of their intentions, it is known that the ancient method of catching locusts had no other technique than burning with fire. In the early years of the Kaiyuan era, there was drought and locusts in Shandong. Yao Yuancong requested that envoys be dispatched to catch locusts, saying: "I have heard that the poem 'Holding and Giving to the Blazing Fire' in the Great Field is the technique of catching locusts. The ancients did it before, and Your Majesty uses it after. The ancients did it to reassure the farmers; Your Majesty uses it to eliminate the harm." It can be seen that the fire attack strategy has been regarded as the essential method for catching locusts throughout the ages.

### The Process of Salvation

To explore this issue, it is best to base our understanding on Acts 2:37-42 in the New Testament. Due to space limitations, we will only discuss the key points:

1. Hearing the Gospel—"When they heard this." The so-called "this" refers to how Jesus was crucified by sinners, later resurrected, and ascended to heaven. Everyone! Don't think hearing is easy. Many people don't hear, and some even refuse to hear. It's so pitiful! These people are truly unaware of the danger they are in! Such people are the standard, old-fashioned prisoners of the devil because the devil is afraid that people will hear and believe, so he tries his best to hinder people from hearing the word. Friends! Do you want to break free from the power of darkness? If you are willing, please come, listen, and implement this first line of counterattack.

2. Feeling in the Heart—"They were cut to the heart." This is not salvation, but a preliminary recognition of oneself and sin! However, this experience is also valuable because he has begun to be illuminated by God's light. Friends! Have you ever had this experience?

3. Asking for Guidance—"Brothers, what shall we do?" Being restless and disturbed naturally leads to such a question. Friends! Do you need an answer to this question?

4. Receiving Guidance—"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."

5. Accepting in the Heart—"Received his message." The Holy Spirit leads people step by step, like climbing a mountain. Accepting in the heart is like reaching the summit. If you sincerely accept it, you will receive God's promise in John 3:16.

### Elementary School Summer Homework Competition Questions (2)

Elementary Level

Composition: A Day's Diary

Calligraphy: You Carry the Gun, I Take the Knife, Military Drill

Advanced Level

Composition: Record a Meaningful Event in the Summer Vacation

Calligraphy: Conserve Money, Practice Saving

### Composition Topic Guidance

A Day's Diary: A diary should be written every day. Choose the best one from your daily diaries to submit as an entry. The standards for a good diary are that the events recorded are valuable and interesting, and the writing is relatively fluent. The most undesirable diary is one that simply records mundane, repetitive daily life, such as what time you get up, wash your face, read, write, and what time you go to bed. It is completely a routine account. Don't say that it tastes like chewing wax to the reader, even the writer feels it is very mechanical!

Record a Meaningful Event in the Summer Vacation: The event can be related to family, society, country, or the world. The source can be something you have done, seen, or heard. As long as it is meaningful, it is good. What is meant by meaningful is that it has a significant relationship to human life, society, the country, or the world, and is worth recording. Whether it is interesting is secondary. This article should be divided into several layers of meaning, which should be decided first. Important parts should be written in detail, and secondary parts should be written briefly. Clear organization and distinct structure make a good article.

### Regarding the Stamps for Essay Submission

The meaning of the stamps below is worth explaining to all the children:

The central pattern, "申," is the ancient form of the character "申," and the bell shape is a wooden clapper.

Shen Bao bears the important responsibility of promoting education and publicizing culture. Therefore, it adopts the two-day metaphor of Confucius as a wooden clapper to symbolize the important mission that Shen Bao shoulders!

This time it is used as a stamp for essay submissions. All of you children should cut and paste one onto your exam paper according to the rules. Otherwise, no matter how good the essay is, the exam paper will be invalid. Please pay attention!

### How to Practice Drawing Economically?

— Liang Huan

In these extraordinary times, everything is soaring in price. Paper, paint, and drawing tools are several times more expensive than before the war. It seems not easy for us to practice drawing. Many parents may prevent their children from practicing drawing due to economic reasons, which is very regrettable. In fact, if children are determined to do this, they can also come up with various economical methods that can achieve satisfactory results. Now I can offer several methods for children to refer to:

A. Economical Drawing Tools

1. Paper: Commonly used pencil drawing paper is imported and very expensive. We can use domestic alum-treated paper instead. This kind of paper costs about thirty cents per large stack, which is enough. If you can't even buy that, you can use used pencil paper. The clean side can be used for drawing. If it is not clean, you can use thick ink to blacken the entire surface, wait for it to dry, flatten it, and then use white powder to draw. If there is no pencil drawing paper available, you can collect some wrapping kraft paper, wet it with water, flatten it, or stick it on glass, wait for it to dry, and it can also be used as drawing paper.

2. Colors: This is a more difficult problem to solve. Domestically produced cheaper colors, such as the six-color small box from the Marie Factory, also cost six or seven jiao per box; single tubes cost about two jiao each. Western goods are more than ten times more expensive than usual, so there is no need to use them. If you can't even afford domestic goods, you can buy one set together with several classmates and use it in rotation, which is also very convenient. Otherwise, blue and red ink can also be used. If it is difficult to do so, you can use only pencils or ink brushes to create good works. - The popular Chinese ink painting and Western sketching do not use colors.

3. White Powder: This is used when drawing on black or dark-colored paper. In addition to lead powder, shoe polish, facial powder, tooth powder, etc., can be mixed with some glue and used. Adding a little light color to it makes it most clear and beautiful on dark paper.

4. Brushes: Pencils, finely made soft lead, are also very expensive. It doesn't matter if you use the softer pencils that you usually use for writing notes. For brushes, you can wash clean an old medium-sized calligraphy brush and use it. Slate pencils and chalk can be used to practice drawing on slate boards or blackboards, which is relatively the most economical.

5. Eraser: It is best not to use one. If you must use one, you can use a piece of bread instead.

B. Economical Drawing Methods

1. Practice: No matter what you are learning, you should always pay attention to practice if you want to improve. Drawing is no exception, of course. The most valuable way to practice drawing is to sketch from life. Specializing in copying has little effect. (But when learning to draw, you may as well start with copying). The subjects for sketching should mainly be still life, such as stationery, furniture, melons, fruits, vegetables, flowers, etc., which can all be used as sketching materials. Other things, such as sleeping cats and dogs, and younger siblings, can also be used for sketching. As long as you pay attention to practice, no matter what drawing tools you use, no matter indoors or outdoors, practicing for at least fifteen minutes every day will surely result in considerable progress after a summer vacation.

2. Assignments: In addition to practice, if you want to draw a few holiday homework assignments to be submitted to the school, then you can also use readily available paper (no matter the size), using flat washes (ink or white powder are fine), or pencil, ink brush, or add some light colors, to draw the assignments. Before the start of school, choose the best few, paste them on appropriate paper to increase the beauty of the works, and they will become excellent assignments.

### Insects and Bullets (End)

— Su Ming

During the First World War in Europe, a French aviator published a surprising piece of news in the newspaper. He said that when he was flying his plane at an altitude of 2,000 meters to survey the terrain, and the plane's speed was very fast, he suddenly saw a small thing flying towards his face. He thought it was just a small insect, so he grabbed it with his hand. When he took a look at it, it shocked the aviator. Do you know what it was? He actually caught a small enemy artillery shell. Isn't this an unbelievable and unheard-of joke? In fact, upon careful thought, it's not surprising at all, but a normal thing. Because the speed of an artillery shell cannot maintain the speed it had when it just left the muzzle. Due to the resistance of the air, its flight speed gradually decreases. Eventually, it becomes almost the same as the speed of the aircraft. Thus, the aviator would see the phenomenon of the artillery shell not moving in the air, or flying slightly like a small insect, and he would naturally grab it effortlessly. An artillery shell in this condition can be harmless. But under the opposite circumstances, an apple can also injure people like an artillery shell! One day, a car was driving on the highway as fast as a bird. The farmers by the highway threw apples, watermelons, etc. to the cars flying past them to show their welcome. However, these gifts were regarded as terrible artillery shells by the people in the cars. The apples caused them serious injuries, the watermelon smashed the cylinder, and even shattered the glass! What is this! The reason is easy to understand. The speed of the car was originally very fast, and when combined with the speed of the watermelon and apples being thrown, it became a dangerous and destructive bullet. For example, a car traveling at 1.2 million meters per hour, with a 400,000-gram watermelon as an artillery shell, has the same kinetic energy, which will certainly cause terrible results. This is indeed a real event that happened during a car speed competition held in Russia in 1924."

### Shirley Temple's Autobiography (10) (1)

After doing my bedtime prayers by the bed, I went to bed, and my mother immediately turned off the lights. Although I was alone in the dark room with my head on the pillow, I couldn't fall asleep for a while, so I recited those lines over and over again. When I woke up the next morning, I was so familiar with them that they flowed out naturally.

However, when I went to school, I constantly remembered those lines, fearing that I would forget them. However, I not only had to remember the lines; I also needed my mother to guide me on how to perform all the actions. You must know that my mother was indeed a very good director. In the films I starred in, my mother always had to put in a lot of effort to guide me first, so when I went to the film set, it saved the directors a lot of effort. Especially rare was that whenever I worked on the film set, my mother never participated, she just watched. But as soon as we got to the bungalow and returned home, she started to get active, tirelessly guiding me in everything. Therefore, Fox Company paid her a large salary, acknowledging that she was my personal director. I once heard my father tell his friends that with the salary he earned from his job at the bank and the salary my mother earned from the film company, they could just buy a new house, give Jack and John higher education, and raise me well. My father also said that all the money I earned would not be used, but would be completely deposited in his bank until I grew up.

The great star Will Rogers often called my mother my manager. One day, my mother and I were eating in the film set's dining room, and Mr. Rogers ran to our table. The old gentleman liked to tell jokes. Pointing to a plate of vegetables I was eating, he kept shaking his head and said, "Huh! How can you eat this rabbit food, while your manager is eating steak! How does that make sense!" At that time, I told him that this was not rabbit food, and that I liked to eat all kinds of vegetables. The only thing I didn't like was onions.

### Is There a Heavenly Father? (1)

Today, many people say there is no God. They say this because the world is full of injustice and inequality. There are also many people who, although they say there is a God, say that this God is not a good God and does not care about human happiness. Christians not only believe that there is a God, but also believe that God is good and is the Heavenly Father of all mankind.

Now let us study the above three statements to see if what they say is true. Regarding God's qualities, if we say that he is not good, then it is equivalent to saying that he is not God. Because God's existence is related to God's qualities. They either exist together or perish together.

God's goodness is not a new issue. It has been manifested to mankind since the beginning of the world. But why do people think about this issue? And why do they like to discuss this issue? This is because people value morality and goodness, and cherish them above all else. May I ask, where did people's concept of valuing morality and goodness come from? We believe that man was created by God, and people's concept of valuing morality and goodness comes from God, the source of all goodness. People's desire for virtue comes from God, which proves that God himself is good.

Even so, there are many things in the human world that make people doubt God's justice and goodness, and also make many Christians waver in their faith as to whether God is the Heavenly Father of mankind. For the sake of discussion, let's bring up three difficulties: (1) Difficulties in the material world. (2) Difficulties in the animal world. (3) Difficulties in the human world.

(1) Difficulties in the Material World: These difficult questions arise from the suffering personally experienced by humans and animals. This suffering is all caused by natural disasters that humans cannot control—gales, water, fire, earthquakes, landslides, etc.—so humans and animals become helpless victims. For example, the fire and flood disasters in China in 1932 and the Great Kanto Earthquake in Japan in 1923 sacrificed countless lives. When these disasters occur, people will think about whether there is a good God in heaven and earth who cares about his creations? When we raise such questions, we must first remember that our world exists according to certain laws. If these laws stop, we cannot live. The forces that cause rain to fall from the clouds, wind to blow, and fire to burn from the earth all proceed according to these laws, making the world a favorable environment for the survival and prosperity of humans and animals. Sometimes the activities of these forces lead to natural disasters such as storms, floods, or earthquakes, sacrificing many lives. (To be continued on the 23rd)

### Mei Lanfang Has Departed for Manila

— Hui Cun

Hu Die Also Making Preparations to Go to the Philippines

After the war, Mei Lanfang left Shanghai and lived as a recluse in Hong Kong for nearly three years. In his spare time, he socialized with local friends and entertained himself by painting and raising birds. His life was quite leisurely, and he expressed weariness with his stage career. Therefore, he has grown a beard and does not intend to appear on stage again.

Recently, due to the tense situation in Hong Kong Island, the authorities are actively evacuating the population, and various film companies are planning to relocate. Mr. Mei has no intention of staying in Hong Kong Island any longer. It was once rumored that Mr. Mei would be hired to go to Kunming, but that did not materialize. According to news received from Hong Kong, Mr. Mei departed from Hong Kong by ship on the 5th of this month with his entourage for Manila. It is not yet known whether Mr. Mei will reside there permanently. Furthermore, film star Hu Die is also making preparations to leave Hong Kong. It is said that her destination is also Manila, but the date of departure will depend on when she can purchase a ticket. It is also said that Pan Yousheng will accompany her.

### Zhu Bingxin Secretly Arrives in Shanghai

— Taigong

"Mr. Wang" Tang Jie entered Sichuan twice in the past two years, wandering for more than a year before returning to Shanghai to continue filming "Mr. Wang" movies. Four films have now been released. "Painted Phoenix" is a historical "Mr. Wang" film.

Not long ago, this publication carried a piece of news saying that Tang Jie and Zhu Bingxin might rekindle their old relationship. Regarding this, a secret was exclusively obtained by the reporter yesterday: Zhu Bingxin secretly arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong a few days ago. Tang Jie and Zhu Bingxin's union occurred four years ago when the New Era Company announced the cessation of "Mr. Wang," and his screen life could not continue. Just as someone initiated the organization of the "Star Troupe," bringing together song and dance, Peking opera, and drama, to perform in various parts of Southeast Asia, Tang Jie was also one of the mainstays, and Zhu Bingxin was a new member of the song and dance troupe. Before they left Shanghai, Zhu Bingxin, with her passion for screen life, was happy to approach him early on. Before long, the two began living together and had a son and a daughter.

In July of last year, Tang Jie, in a difficult situation, inevitably found it hard to make ends meet. As a result, Han Langen introduced a lawyer to help them dissolve their spousal relationship. This time, Zhu Bingxin secretly came to Shanghai, of course, both parties are very satisfied. Tang Jie is currently busy working for Xinhua, and the remuneration is relatively high, so he is not afraid of another economic panic.

It is now heard that Zhu Bingxin is temporarily staying at a friend's house while waiting for Tang Jie to arrange things properly before reopening their old business. However, whether Zhu Bingxin will dedicate herself to the screen or pursue other work is still undecided. Perhaps everyone will know after a period of time.

Hawthorn Detective Case

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— By Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 3: Conflicting Information

Hawthorn exhaled a puff of smoke and turned his head to glance at me and Ni Jinshou. Ni Jinshou nodded, seeming to indicate that he understood Hawthorn's hint. I also realized that Wang Lilan's saying "nothing happened" to Old Mao was precisely a footnote to "something happened." She clearly deliberately wanted to send Old Mao away.

Hawthorn then asked Old Mao, "Okay, you continue. What time did you return from the theater last night?"

Old Mao said, "I came back very early, around twelve o'clock I arrived here--"

Hawthorn interrupted, "What? The theater let out that early?"

"No, it was very stuffy last night, and the theater was packed. I sat for less than two hours, and my head started to feel dizzy. Later, the more I watched, the dizzier I became, like I was having heatstroke. Around half-past eleven, I couldn't bear it any longer, so I ran out before the show ended."

Hawthorn nodded. "What happened after that?"

Old Mao said, "After I came back, I swallowed some Wan Jin oil, drank a cup of cold tea, and the dizziness got much better--"

"Wait. When you entered the door, what was the situation in this house?"

As soon as Old Mao heard this sentence, his interest in talking seemed to increase again. He lowered his voice and said, "What I want to tell you about the strange situation is this: I came from the side of Datong Road. Near the corner of Datong Road, there was a black car parked, but there was no one in the car. At the time, I didn't pay attention, so I didn't notice the car's license plate. When I entered the gate, I saw that the lights on the second-floor windows were all off, only the lights in this reception room were still on. It was raining heavily at the time. When I entered the gate, the door was ajar and not locked. After I came in, I gently closed the door as usual and went into my own gatehouse."

"Didn't you lock the gate?"

Old Mao shook his head. "No."

### Mao Shilai's "New Yu Tang Chun"

— Keyun

After Mao Shilai entered the school of Xun, he was long renowned in the old capital for the play "New Yu Tang Chun," a masterpiece by Weisheng. This time, the Golden Label performed this play, and I went to listen. The sultry heat was oppressive, and I listened to the play while wiping away sweat. After the singing ended, I returned home and wrote this article to fill the pages of this publication.

Shilai's voice is abundant, and his foundation is also good. However, the softness and bonelessness of the Xun style, and the gentle and melodious sound, are not easy to use. Shilai's singing is flat and shows no change. He is very similar to Weisheng in many ways, but he is more outstanding in his broad and bright, "snapping eyes" in rhythm. The achievement of his entire vocal performance is especially superior. Therefore, the inflections are gentle and moving, and every word is pleasing to the ear. Compared to the past, he has indeed made progress. A connoisseur of opera like myself is deeply gratified. The love narrative at Guanwang Temple, with the performance of small movements in the posture of a martial woman, half-pushed, half-accepted, graceful and charming, without appearing vulgar, is something rarely seen in other performers. The solo singing of the "Nan Bangzi" tune in a small building dressing up is intricate, with rapid rhythms, yet the threads are not disordered, and the pronunciation is accurate. He is almost indistinguishable from Weisheng. This harvest, achieved through a lot of practice and refinement, is truly admirable.

### Li Qinian May Arrive in Shanghai This Afternoon —Yi Hua Gives the Title of "Southern Queen of Film"

The news of the Southern Queen of Film, Li Qinian, coming to Shanghai has been detailed in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the Dutch postal ship Chizasanica, on which Li is traveling, was originally scheduled to pass through Xiamen first, and only arrive in Shanghai on the 22nd. Now the itinerary has been changed to sail directly to Shanghai. If there is no wind resistance, it will arrive at the port at 3:00 PM today (the 21st). At that time, tens of thousands of people will gather on the Bund, and there will be a lively scene.

It is also reported that Yi Hua's publicity department has decided to expand publicity for Li Qinian, who is known as a "patriotic artist." It is heard that if Li does indeed come to Shanghai on the 21st, she will host celebrities from all walks of life on the 22nd, editors of film magazines and periodicals on the 23rd, and reporters from major newspapers on the evening of the same day, and will use "Southern Queen of Film" as a promotional title.
