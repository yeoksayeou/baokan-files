### Historic Compiègne Forest: Germany and France Hold Armistice Negotiations; Hitler Presents Armistice Terms to French Representatives, Demanding Guarantees for Continued War Against Britain

Berlin – German Führer and Supreme Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Hitler, in the Compiègne Forest (the site where Germany accepted harsh armistice terms twenty-two years ago), presented the armistice terms requested by France to representatives of the French government, official sources here announced this afternoon. General Keitel provided a brief explanation after the armistice terms were presented (June 21, Hai Tong Telegraph).

Compiègne – General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the German Armed Forces, read aloud the preamble to the armistice terms drafted by Germany to the French representatives. It is said that the purpose of establishing these conditions is threefold: (1) to prevent further war; (2) to provide Germany with guarantees for its war against Britain; and (3) to create a foundation for building a new peace, the main point of which is to correct the unjust situation caused by the previous European war (June 21, Hai Tong Telegraph).

Madrid – According to reliable French sources, the French fleet has decided to assist the Allied forces. The French fleets in the Atlantic and Mediterranean are acting in accordance with British orders (June 21, United Press).

Rome – French authorities have ordered the entire navy to return to France and Algiers. According to the "Stefani News Agency," the French fleet is rushing back to ports in mainland France and Algiers to await further orders. The French government has apparently accepted Germany's demands (June 21, International News Service).

Solemn Ceremony Held in Commemorative Railway Car

Berlin – According to the German official news agency, Hitler met with French plenipotentiaries in the Compiègne Forest today. Hitler received the French representatives at 3:30 PM. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Deputy Führer Hess, Commander-in-Chief of the Army General von Brauchitsch, and Chief of Staff of the Army High Command General Keitel accompanied him. The French delegation consisted of General Huntziger, a member of the French Supreme Military Council, Air Force General Bergeret, Vice Admiral Le Luc, and Ambassador to Poland Noël. The news agency also stated that the German Führer's action of granting the terms to the French representatives in the Compiègne Forest was held in a railway car, the same car where Marshal Foch presented the armistice terms to the German representatives under shameful circumstances on November 11, 1918. The ceremony held today in the Compiègne Forest has offset the injustice suffered by Germany. The solemn hospitality extended by the German side to the defeated enemy, compared with the memories left here in those days, proves the perpetual hatred held by the French for the German army, which was not defeated at that time. General Keitel, on behalf of the German Führer, read the preamble to the armistice terms as follows: "The German army trusted the guarantee given by President Wilson to the German government and confirmed by the Allied powers, and laid down their weapons in November 1918. Thus, the war, which the German people and government did not want, came to an end. In this war, although the enemy forces possessed absolute superior force, they ultimately failed to defeat the German army, navy, and air force. When the German armistice delegation arrived, the Allied powers began to violate their solemn promises. On November 11, 1918, in this same railway car, the era of suffering for the German people began. The dishonor, humiliation, and human and material suffering that could be inflicted on a country all originated from this point. The Allied powers harmed a country with broken promises and false oaths, a country that, after four years of heroic resistance, only revealed one weakness: believing in the promises of democratic politicians. On September 3, 1939, twenty-five years after the outbreak of the World War, Britain and France declared war on Germany for no reason. Now, the war has been decided by weapons. France has been defeated, and the French government has applied to the German government for the release of armistice terms. If the historical Compiègne Forest is used as the place to hand over these conditions, this is to forever eliminate a memory by means of eliminating injustice. This memory is not a glorious one in French history, and Germany feels it is a deep and eternal shame. France, after heroic resistance, has been defeated and collapsed in a bloody battle. Therefore, Germany, in armistice negotiations with this brave enemy, does not want to make these negotiations humiliating.

The objectives required by Germany are: (1) to prevent the recurrence of war; (2) to give Germany various guarantees so that it can continue to wage war against Britain, which Germany is indeed forced to do; and to create the initial steps for the construction of a new peace, the important content of which will be to repair the past actions imposed on Germany by violence.

After the preamble was read, the Führer left the site of the negotiations, and the sound of German national music filled the air (June 21, Reuters).

French Plenipotentiaries Return Swiftly to Bordeaux

Capital of Switzerland – According to a message from Rome Radio Station, after the French plenipotentiaries met with the German representatives, they swiftly returned to Bordeaux. It is expected that the French government will order a ceasefire in the next two days (June 21, Havas News Agency).

Geneva – The biographical outlines of the four French plenipotentiaries participating in the peace talks with Germany are as follows: General Huntziger, in his sixties, is the youngest member of the French Supreme Military Council. Huntziger is from Alsace. When the mutual assistance pact among Britain, France, and Turkey was concluded, Huntziger was the supreme commander in Syria, and later negotiated a military regulations agreement with Turkey, particularly focusing on Turkey's obligations in the Mediterranean in the event of war. In 1938, he conducted negotiations in Ankara (the Turkish capital), harmonizing Turkish policy with the British and French Mediterranean policies. The following year, he went from Ankara to London to discuss a joint British-French-Turkish combat plan with Sir Goad. Ambassador Noël was born in Paris in 1888 and served as the district chief of Upper Alsace. When Laval first formed a cabinet, Noël served as the Secretary-General in the Ministry of Interior. In 1931, he was transferred to the post of Minister to Czechoslovakia, and soon after became the Secretary-General to Prime Minister Flandin. In 1935, he was appointed as the French Ambassador to Poland. Vice Admiral Le Luc and Air Force General Bergeret have no political experience, but Le Luc is the head of the French Naval Ministry (June 21, Hai Tong Telegraph).

French Government Submits Armistice Request to Italy

Rome – According to official confirmation here, the French government has submitted an armistice request to Italy through the Spanish government. The Italian official statement is as follows: "On the morning of June 20, the French government, through the Spanish government, requested to hold armistice negotiations with Italy. The Italian government immediately responded, expressing the hope that the names of the French plenipotentiaries would be announced as soon as possible. The meeting location should be decided soon." (June 21, Hai Tong News Agency).

Rome – Rome Radio announced last night that France requested armistice talks with Italy yesterday. The report stated, "This morning, the French government requested armistice talks with Italy through the Spanish government. Italy has replied to France through the Spanish government, and the wording is no different from that with Germany, that Rome is waiting for France to send plenipotentiaries to notify Italy, and then a date and place will be selected for the meeting." (June 22, United Press).

Bordeaux Demilitarized; France Selects Another Capital

Capital of Sweden – According to news from London, in order to designate Bordeaux as a demilitarized city, the government will reportedly move away from the city (June 21, Hai Tong Telegraph).

Capital of Sweden – According to news received here from London, the French government left Bordeaux yesterday afternoon. This matter was notified by Prime Minister Pétain to the mayor of the city, stating that the purpose of the relocation was to save Bordeaux from unnecessary destruction. However, the destination was not announced. According to refugees fleeing from Bordeaux, the French government has moved to Biarritz (June 21, Hai Tong Telegraph).

Editorial

### Responding to the Changing Situation

One must have a clear understanding to have a firm resolve; one must have a firm resolve to be able to handle oneself properly. To live in this great turmoil and have few faults. Like those who suddenly encounter storms and panic without knowing what to do, who lightly believe in rumors and are at a loss as to what to do, who frown and sigh, whose minds wander like wild horses, and who are in constant anxiety, it is not that they are timid, but that their understanding is insufficient. Ever since the European war took a sharp turn, the world has been shaken. It is indeed a matter of the survival of several countries, the rise and fall of several nations, and the historical destiny of the next few decades, which will hinge on this turning point, and is by no means a trivial matter. Compared to the safety and well-being of any single person or family, it is truly insignificant. Those with a clear understanding must know that the impact of the great era on the safety and well-being of an individual or family is irresistible and should be disregarded; they must also know that a seven-foot-tall body should not betray the great era, and they must do their best to be effective cells in improving the great era. What is a cell? The whole is structured by it; the cell has no independent life, no independent power, and its life and power are linked to the whole; the whole has countless effective cells, and therefore has its infinite life and power. This humble self is not enough to accomplish anything, but with regard to the people, I will do my best to be a person, with regard to the country, I will fulfill my duties as a citizen; with regard to the cause, since I am a member, I must fulfill my responsibilities as a member; a father must fulfill his duty, a teacher must fulfill his duty, and children and youth must fulfill their duty. These are the good cells of the nation and society, and they are truly beneficial to the great era. Doing one's best, one can have peace of mind; knowing that one cannot live in isolation from the changes in the world, one will not care about the safety and well-being of oneself and one's family, and will no longer panic or be at a loss. Is this just empty talk and preaching? Shanghai, after the dramatic changes in Europe, has suddenly become precarious; if we analyze the situation, we can see that there are hardly any international events that have directly affected Shanghai; most of the anxiety is due to the lack of understanding among the residents, and there are those who take advantage of this situation for their own benefit, fanning the flames and stirring up trouble. Those with a little wealth are most afraid of losing it, and it seems that there is no place in the world that can completely protect them; they think that the concessions cannot be relied on, that Shanghai is not a good place to live, so why not Hong Kong? They also think that Britain is losing the war, so Hong Kong is also unsafe, so why not the Philippines or Honolulu? Then they think that the journey is too far, the US dollars are too expensive, and the Pacific Ocean may not be peaceful. There is no way to heaven, no door to hell; and they do not know that if the nation is not independent and national sovereignty is not complete, there is no guarantee at all; even if they take their assets to the underworld, there will still be tomb robbers and bone thieves. There are many people who are so foolish and reckless, and they aggravate each other's anxiety, forming one of the causes of precariousness and unease. Those who take advantage of the situation for their own benefit take advantage of the chaos and want nothing more than to see the world in turmoil. Thus, they export rice to Hong Kong, falsely claiming that Vietnamese rice will be cut off; they claim that the British and Japanese are colluding with each other because the siege of the Tianjin concession has been lifted; they claim that the United States is expanding its military budget, claiming that the United States is expanding its war profiteering; in addition, with regard to Shanghai's security and the nature of the concessions, they fabricate rumors and exaggerate the truth, using every possible means; in short, they exploit the residents' lack of understanding, fabricate various opportunities, and covet their legal tender, which they do not know what to do with. The world is changing rapidly, and the future is long; all kinds of unexpected changes and confusing talk will change with the times, and there is no way to predict or prevent them; and so-called understanding and resolve cannot be achieved by luck. Here, I would like to speak in general terms: the welfare of the Chinese people depends on the great cause of resistance and construction; the future of Shanghai depends on the Sino-Japanese war; the elite troops of Germany can prove the failure of Japan, the tragic defeat of France can illustrate the ability of China to fight; the actions of the United States are beneficial to the Far East, and the stability of the Far East can only be achieved by China's victory; these are the constants in the midst of change. As for how to deal with the changing situation, it is useless to be confused and anxious, it is useless to exhaust oneself; the key is to have a firm grip on the constants, to have a firm belief, and to embrace all kinds of situations with one heart. Therefore, the vicissitudes of the world are not to be feared, what is to be feared is the lack of determination and self-degradation. General Pétain, in discussing the failure of the French war, while also attributing it to the inferiority of military equipment, said most painfully, "Since the victory in 1918, the spirit of seeking pleasure has exceeded the spirit of sacrifice, and what the people need is greater than what they give, and everyone wants to conserve their own labor, and today's great disaster has befallen us." Pétain's criticism of his countrymen can also serve as a wake-up call for Shanghai society. Today's Shanghai is scarred, but there are those who think of getting wealth illegally, getting something for nothing, seeking only the pleasures of the senses, and extravagance in consumption, and they are not only degrading themselves, but also becoming the cause of poisoning society. There are too many fallen people to punish, and it is hoped that the general public will realize that from the evolution of the European situation to the victory of the Chinese War of Resistance, there is a considerable distance in both space and time; although there is a constant way to the final destination, one must still prepare to deal with all kinds of twists and turns to cross this distance. Therefore, one must maintain a consistent belief and not seek temporary ease; one must know that composure can cope with change, and self-reliance can lead to regeneration, and doing one's best is the way to handle oneself and the world.

### German Main Force Along the Loire River

Port of Bordeaux – The German troops are advancing along the Loire River, having reached the south of Châtillon-sur-Indre, about ten English miles away. Their main force is along the Loire River. According to a French source, the German army has bypassed Tours on the Loire River and is approaching the south of the city, about fifteen miles away. In addition, in the areas of the Alsace and Lorraine provinces, the French army is planning to break through the German lines west of the Maginot Line, resulting in fierce fighting between the two sides. As for the border between France and Italy in the Alps, the Italian army has not yet attacked (June 20, Havas).

Port of Bordeaux – Yesterday, the German army continued to advance. Although the French army continued to resist, a large area of land was again controlled by the German army. According to a French communiqué, German reconnaissance teams south of Nantes and west of Bourges (144 miles south of Paris) advanced yesterday towards Gannat and Vichy (south of Lyon) and towards Nantua (June 21, Reuters).

Port of Bordeaux – The General Headquarters issued a war report late last night stating, "There have been no significant changes on the front line today. Enemy reconnaissance units have advanced towards Montluçon and Vichy, south of Nantes, west of Le Pury, and south of Lyon towards Nantua" (June 20, Havas).

### German War Report

Hitler's Headquarters – This afternoon, the German war report stated that the German army is advancing extremely rapidly, capturing Lyon in one battle and Nevers in the next, acquiring 702 armored vehicles. Fighting is still continuing in Alsace and Lorraine, because some French troops are still entrenched in several sections of the Maginot Line, putting up a desperate fight. The French troops trapped in northern Lorraine have been dispersed by the German army into several small units. Hartmannswillerkopf is now in German hands. Yesterday, German fighter planes continued to bomb the retreating enemy along the roads. Stuka dive bombers destroyed several fortresses of the Maginot Line. Yesterday, German aircraft attacked ships near La Rochelle, sinking a 10,000-ton military transport ship and a 4,000-ton auxiliary warship. British aircraft dropped several bombs on northern and western Germany last night, but the damage was minimal. Only a few civilians were killed. Yesterday, a total of six enemy aircraft were lost, four of which were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. Two German aircraft went missing. A German submarine sank four British merchant ships, one of which was a 11,000-ton mail ship. When the German army quickly broke through the Maginot Line, infantry and engineers made outstanding contributions. The bravery of Infantry Regiment Commander Colonel Schwabe was particularly admirable (June 21, Hai Tong).

Berlin – The French army is unable to conduct operations under unified command. In any case, the speed of the German advance is enough to turn the French army pale. The French troops in the Maginot Line seem to be in dire straits. Although they have repeatedly tried to break out, they have not succeeded. Brest, the last channel port of France on the western wing, has fallen into German hands. This port will become a solid base for operations against Britain. The west coast of Britain is already in front of the German lines, very close. It is impossible for the French high command to establish a strong line of resistance, even on the Garonne River. The French troops that are currently retreating are being pursued and surrounded by the German army, with no reinforcements in sight. Lyon has been captured, and the German army will immediately attack the rear of the French defenses against Italy. The German army is now able to send its reserve new army, mechanized units, and infantry, which are increasing daily. Although the French army is still putting up a stubborn resistance in some places, it cannot change the German plan of operations. The rumors that France still possesses an effective air force are not true. As mentioned above, the French air force should be able to use its power to hinder the German advance. The French navy is still intact, but it is not enough to change the fate of France (June 21, Hai Tong).

### Intense Land and Air Battles on the Libyan Border; Italian Army Chief Engineer Captured

London – According to authorities here, the British army won a victory in Libya, capturing General Alstrouci, Chief Engineer of the Italian Tenth Army in Libya (June 21, Reuters).

London – A Reuters correspondent with the British army in the western Egyptian desert reports that the British army is now deeply entrenched, guarding the line on the Libyan border, and from time to time sending patrols to harass the enemy near the coastal area of Sollum. Enemy aircraft fly from Libya to Sollum twice a day to bomb and strafe, which has become commonplace. British troops hide in the trenches near the jungle to avoid their attacks whenever enemy aircraft arrive. Enemy aircraft sometimes fly very high, and the high-explosive bombs they drop often fall into the sand. Some also fly as low as a hundred feet, attempting to strafe British troops hiding in the trenches with machine guns. British soldiers retaliate with Bren guns. At the same time, these low-flying enemy aircraft also drop small hand grenades. Apart from the British Air Force, the most successful unit in the Western Sahara is the British armored car unit. It is due to their efforts that the British army is able to control 1,500 square miles of Italian territory. The British armored car unit, because of its brave fighting and initiative, is often able to exchange minimal losses for amazing victories. On several occasions, four British armored cars penetrated deep into enemy territory along the coastal road from Bardia to Tobruk, repeatedly capturing supplies. The spoils captured include 34 trucks, 3 staff cars, and 2 civilian cars destroyed. In addition, they killed 1 Italian officer and 20 soldiers, and captured 10 Italian officers (including 1 general), 61 Italian soldiers, and 17 native soldiers. Anyone who has inspected the British-Italian front can see that both sides are fighting under very difficult conditions. Because of the vast desert, thousands of miles of transportation lines must be maintained, and remote outposts must be supplied with sufficient rations at all times. In addition, troops must be transported under the tropical sun, and the wounded must be evacuated, passing through waterless and barren deserts, and often subjected to sandstorms. The hardship of the situation is beyond description. I (the correspondent) sat with British troops in a car equipped with radio, listening quietly to the news broadcast from London. Although these soldiers had not washed for several days and were covered in dirt, they looked very happy while listening. When the broadcast was over, an Irish soldier said to others, "We will show the people back home how to win this war." This group of British troops, including soldiers from the dominions and India, has very high morale. There is a huge difference between the British and Italian armies currently fighting in Libya: the morale of the British army is obviously high, while the enemy has not yet achieved this. Even the Italian officers who are detained in the British army battlefield headquarters officers' room do not hide their sad emotions and are quite unhappy about being in the "hands of friends." From the conversations of the captured officers, it can be seen that the Italian and native soldiers under their command share the same worries and have no intention of fighting. The damage caused by Italian air raids has been very minor so far. The materials used in the Italian tanks are very poor, and even our small arms can penetrate their armor and kill the soldiers inside. On several occasions, Italian troops have raised white flags and then opened fire on advancing British tanks. The British army has now taken precautions. On one occasion, an Italian officer held a white flag in one hand and a hand grenade in the other (June 21, Reuters).

Rome – According to an announcement from the Italian military headquarters, Italian aircraft bombed Bizerte and Malta last night, with great success. They also continued to scout Mediterranean naval ports and airfields. Fighting is continuing in North Africa, with both sides vying for strategic locations. The enemy lost more than a dozen aircraft and forty tanks. The ports of Mersa Matruh and Sidi Barrani were bombed last night, causing considerable damage. In East Africa, the British attacked the base of Javiel, and two aircraft were shot down. Enemy attacks on Italy have obviously eased. Yesterday, only one bomb was dropped in Imbiria, falling on an open space (June 21, Hai Tong).

North Africa, French Algeria – French military authorities recently issued a communiqué stating, "On the 18th of this month, our supplementary troops made contact with the enemy in the Nalout area (in Italian Libya, 33 miles east of the Tunisian border) and south of Jebel Nafusa. The enemy air force attempted to bomb the airfield near Benghazi, but our air force flew to scout the ports of Tripoli in Sicily, Sardinia, and the Libyan colony. Afterwards, all the aircraft returned safely to base." Another communiqué was issued stating, "Since Italy entered the war, our air force has been very active, repeatedly conducting reconnaissance flights deep into Italy and bombing the ports of Tripoli and Cagliari (in southern Sardinia) in retaliation for the Italian air force's bombing of the ports of Tunis and Bizerte. The first time was on the night of the 15th of this month, when multiple bombs were dropped on the port of Tripoli, hitting the docks. The second time was on the night of the 17th of this month, when the Italian airfield was bombed, hitting hangars and destroying several enemy aircraft. The enemy did not react strongly. All of our aircraft returned safely to base" (June 20, Havas).

### Air Battle Occurs in a Town on the Southern Coast of England

London – This morning, an air battle lasting 35 minutes occurred over a town on the southern coast of England. The sound of machine guns was incessant. A German bomber flew over the town and strafed, but was driven away by a British fighter. There were no casualties. (Reuters, 21st)

London – The "Daily Mail" commented on the German air raids on England, stating that the damage so far has been minimal, but the scale of the attacks is still small. We must prepare to deal with a truly large-scale attack. Several newspapers commented on the solidity of the Anderson air-raid shelters. The "Daily Mail" said that this type of air-raid shelter is able to withstand bomb blasts and is not afraid of bomb fragments, which has been proven. (Reuters, 21st)

### British Air Force Launches a Large-Scale Attack on German Territory, Over a Dozen German Cities Bombed, Severe Damage to the Rouen Airfield from Air Raid

London – The Air Ministry announced last night that the Royal Air Force has launched a large-scale operation, including attacks on targets in Rouenbourg, Hamm, Belfie, Munster, Duren Schwardt, Osjieshen, Mönchengladbach, Hamborn, Emmerich, Hamburg, Bahrensbuttel, and Norderney. One of our planes did not return. Military depots in Ymuiden and Sheveningen, as well as the Bibogen airfield, were also attacked by our planes. Fires broke out in all three locations. This morning, ten squadrons of Hurricane British planes attacked a large number of enemy planes parked at the Rouen airfield. Four of them were hit and caught fire, and many others were destroyed by machine-gun fire. This afternoon, another squadron of Blenheim British planes flew to the airfield to continue the attack. No British planes were lost. The Air Ministry released a bulletin at 9 pm last night, continuing to detail the British raid on the Rouen airfield yesterday, stating that Hurricane British planes strafed fifty German Ju52 (troop transport planes) and Ju87 (dive bombers). Pilots estimated that at least twenty were destroyed. (Haitong News Agency, 20th)

Berlin – British aircraft groups bombed northern and western Germany again last night. According to the official report released by the German military authorities, the British bombing was indiscriminate. Bombs dropped in Cologne all fell in residential areas, killing two and injuring four. Four bombs were dropped in Coblentz, collapsing a cowshed. Ten bombs were dropped in Humes, killing sixty sheep. Ten people were killed in a residential area of Speyer. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

London – Regarding the German side's claim that more than a hundred bombers carried out the largest air raid since the start of the war and dropped a large number of bombs in various parts of England, the Ministry of Internal Security announced last night, "As far as we can ascertain, eight people died and sixty were injured in last night's air raid. Recent reports confirm that material losses are not serious." (Reuters, 20th)

### Trapped French Troops Cross into Switzerland, Now Numbering Around 40,000

Bern – The number of troops crossing into Switzerland from France has now reached around 40,000. 28,000 people arrived in Switzerland last night, including 16,000 Polish soldiers. (Reuters, 21st)

Bern – Yesterday, French troops continued to escape into Switzerland from the besieged Maginot Line fortresses. The French troops were disarmed upon entering Swiss territory and placed in special camps. A border post reported last night that a total of 1,400 French troops had escaped into Switzerland in that area, as well as 1,600 French civilians seeking refuge in Switzerland. (United Press, 21st)

Swiss Capital – Since the outbreak of war in eastern France, the normal life of the Swiss border has been disrupted, and the government authorities are extremely concerned about it. The biggest impact is on the economy. For example, several munitions factories in the border area, which had accepted orders from the government, have now had to temporarily suspend work. In addition, French people have been fleeing from the war zone into Switzerland. As soon as they arrive at the border, the Swiss authorities take care of them. Local farmers are generally generous and righteous, and often voluntarily declare to the government that they are willing to provide housing for refugees, saying, "These refugees are no different from our brothers. It is only natural for them to stay in our homes." Although these French refugees are displaced and have suffered greatly, their spirits are excellent, and they do not want to increase the burden on the Swiss government, but are willing to find work to support themselves. Since Switzerland implemented mobilization, thousands of young people have joined the army and are serving in the military, so French refugees have a good chance of finding work. (Havas News Agency, 20th)

### Two Major Reasons for France's Defeat: Strategic Errors and Political Discord

London – A Reuters reporter cabling from France stated that, according to objective French sources, the French army, considered the best in Europe, was defeated, and the French government subsequently surrendered. There are two reasons for this: (1) the military views held by the French General Staff, and (2) deeply rooted political discord. In terms of military affairs, the General Staff underestimated the importance of tanks and aircraft, considering them auxiliary weapons. They insisted that this war was like Napoleon's wars, requiring the use of dense infantry to win. Their actions were based on lessons learned from the end of the last war, relying on positions and fortress warfare. General Guderian had anticipated the German strategy, but his theories contradicted the opinions of the General Staff, so he was opposed. At the beginning of the war, in the Battle of the Ardennes Forest, French tanks proved their superiority. The Germans learned this lesson and accelerated the deployment of their armored divisions, using dense tanks in combat. On a sixty-mile front, the Germans used nearly four thousand tanks. The morale of the French army was strong, but heavy losses were suffered in terms of manpower and materials in the initial battles and in the Battle of Dunkirk. Later, although the French army used good tactics and fought bravely, it was unable to reverse the initial defeat. Finally, the French army was divided into four armies by the Germans, each fighting separately, without a continuous line of defense. The Maginot Line had enough supplies for four months, but the line has now been outflanked by the Germans. When the French government decided to evacuate Paris, and later abandoned the capital without defending it, the people's confidence suffered a truly serious blow. When the government arrived in Tours, rumors of imminent surrender were rife. In Tours, Generals Pétain and Weygand reportedly said, "We can negotiate with the enemy generals as soldiers, and we will obtain an armistice that saves France's honor and avoids unnecessary slaughter." Prime Minister Reynaud and Interior Minister Mandel and others said that they were dealing with Hitler, not with soldiers. By the time the French government went to Bordeaux, it lacked organization, and a sense of despair grew. It was believed that the final decision to reorganize the cabinet, excluding those who advocated resistance and replacing them with those who were prepared to negotiate, was a foregone conclusion. This was decided during six evening cabinet meetings. (Reuters, 21st)

### The London Times Examines the Economic Order of Europe, the Unstable Situation in War-Torn Countries, Hitler Will Not Be Easy to Govern

London – The Times editorial stated in brief that the publishers of Nazi and Fascist newspapers, under the direction of Berlin and Rome, are now expounding various arguments about the prospects for a new European order. It should be known that Germany and Italy have already gained much land, and it will not be easy to develop it. The work of the secret police is a tool of revenge and terror, not a way of eternal administration. The people of Norway, Belgium, and France living there have their own traditional system of autonomy, which has lasted for a long time. Even other people, such as the Poles and Czechs, have never forgotten their hope and freedom under centuries of oppression. The enjoyment of independence over the past twenty years has made them even more unforgettable. Therefore, high-pressure tactics are not a sharp weapon to rule nations with high culture who are unwilling to be bound. Military defeats and land occupation, the first spectacle they create, is universal economic disorder. This will reveal that German rule has no way to begin, because even if seventy-five million Germans are all unitedly loyal to Nazi ideals, they cannot forever subdue ninety million people who unanimously hate the shackles of Germany. In terms of administration, the Europe ravaged by Germany will not be a dream, and it is also a particularly strenuous situation that Germany cannot maintain. In economic terms, Germany's desire to economically dominate Europe is an even more empty fantasy. The mobilization of blue armies, the abandonment of businesses, and the mass movement of refugees have destroyed most of Europe's economic structure. Fields are barren, food is gradually lacking, and war-torn countries are almost all like this. Even if this kind of panic can be lifted, the problem that Germany wants to resist the world alone and make Europe a self-sufficient economic unit under German rule will ultimately be unsolvable. Continental Europe cannot be self-sufficient. The metals, rubber, and oil that it needs must rely on external supplies. Europe is barely self-sufficient in food, but only if the standard of living is lower than what Western Europe and Germany are accustomed to. The normal trade of European countries mostly depends on sea transport, so their transport is tied to sea power. As long as those who rule continental Europe do not acquire sea power, the lessons of Napoleon's Continental Blockade will remain valid. Even if Hitler's dominance can be established, it lacks various elements of stability. Conquering Europe is not only conquering Britain, but also failing to conquer the world. It is not an exaggeration to say that Hitler today is farther away from his final day than he was last September. Europe must have a new order, but this can only be achieved through cooperation, not through conquest, because Europe must be connected with the world outside of Europe, and must not be separated from the world.

### US Chargé d'Affaires to Germany Leaves the US to Return to Post

New York – The US Chargé d'Affaires to Germany, Kirk, has been back in the country reporting on his duties for many days. He recently boarded a plane to Lisbon to transfer to his post in Berlin. (Havas News Agency, 21st)

### Indian National Congress Passes Resolution: Principles for Dealing with Aggression

India, Wardha – The Standing Committee of the Indian National Congress passed a resolution rejecting the principle of non-violent resistance to foreign aggression. At the same time, the National Congress's efforts to achieve internal political goals will still strictly adhere to non-violent means. Gandhi's doctrine even advocates complete non-violence against aggressive actions. Therefore, Gandhi has now been relieved of responsibility for the new policy of the Congress Party. The significance of the resolution is that if the Congress Party and the Muslims and the government can reach a compromise on political disputes, then the Congress Party can devote all its efforts to recruitment and the manufacture of armaments. Gandhi has been in command of the Congress Party for many years, and this is his first loss of power. The majority firmly believe that India must have a powerful army to cope with the current crisis. (Reuters, 21st)

### Japan Peeks into Vietnam and Burma, The Chinese Side is Prepared to Cope with Any Situation, Mobilizing a Large Army to Increase Defense on the Yunnan-Guangxi Border, Chongxi Claims to Extend the War of Resistance

Chongqing – According to Chinese sources, although the Japanese have recently attempted to peek into Vietnam and Burma, the Chinese side has long been prepared for this and is sufficient to cope with any situation. According to people from Guilin, General Bai Chongxi recently declared, "Taking advantage of the expansion of the European war and the inability of Britain and France to look eastward, the Japanese will inevitably invade Vietnam and Burma to strengthen their blockade against us. The Japanese have concentrated heavy troops on Hainan Island, and the Japanese army in Yongning has also increased. Because of the active attitude of the United States towards the South Pacific, they may not dare to take immediate action. All our soldiers and civilians should believe in President Chiang's national policy of resistance, as declared over the past three years, not listen to rumors, and prepare for another three years of war." (Express News Agency, 21st)

Chongqing – According to sources in diplomatic circles here, "The government of French Indochina previously sent people here to consult with the Chinese authorities on the attitude that the Chinese government intends to take when the Japanese army uses force to invade Vietnam in the future, and whether it can send troops into Vietnamese territory to assist in defense when necessary, because France's garrison strength in Vietnam is now felt to be insufficient. However, this news has not been officially confirmed by the Chongqing government. Only a semi-official source said that China's war against Japan is a war for independence and freedom and has no connection with the European war. If we send troops to Vietnam to assist in the war, it will create a delicate relationship in the international community. Therefore, the government authorities are still carefully considering it. In order to prevent any eventuality, a large army has been mobilized to increase defense on the Yunnan-Guangxi border. Regarding the suspension of cargo transportation on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, officials here believe that this is a temporary phenomenon, because the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is purely run by French merchants. The French government has especially guaranteed the principal and interest, and it cannot be allowed to continue to lose money in the long run. Moreover, the biggest reason for the interruption of cargo transportation on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is that the sea traffic to Haiphong has been cut off from the outside world." (Express News Agency, 21st)

Hong Kong – According to news arriving locally from Guangzhou Bay, a French concession, at a time of tension in Tokyo Bay, the situation here is also becoming serious.

At the same time, a number of regular troops were transferred from Vietnam to assist the Public Bureau Volunteer Corps and the municipal police in strengthening their defenses. The West Camp and Chikan Public Bureaus also received instructions to increase the number of companies in their Volunteer Corps. The mayor of Chikan Municipality has recently been replaced by Navy Lieutenant Colonel Bailly, which is believed to be the implementation of a unified military and administrative command strategy. (Express News Agency, 21st)

Chongqing – Rumors that Japan has concentrated troops on the border of French Vietnam have been denied by military officials here, who pointed out that Japan's current strength in Nanning is only one and a half divisions, which is definitely not enough to invade Vietnam.

### The British and Japanese Establish the Tianjin Agreement, The Chinese Side Expresses Regret, The Chinese Government Has Declared its Position to the British

Chongqing – Recently, the British and Japanese governments signed an agreement on the Tianjin issue. The British government has now released three documents related to the agreement: one is a plan on the silver issue, one is a public notice on the police agreement, and one is a plan on the currency issue. As far as we know, the Chinese and British governments have also signed an exchange of notes on the silver issue. Now, the Chinese government has issued a statement on this issue, which will be published separately. According to reliable sources, the situation of the Tianjin issue is roughly as follows: The silver stored in the British Concession in Tianjin is owned by the Bank of Communications and constitutes part of China's currency reserve. The Chinese government originally did not intend to transfer this silver for other purposes. However, the Chinese government has paid much attention to the suffering of the people in North China due to floods and droughts. Therefore, in order to alleviate the suffering of the people, the Chinese government has decided to allocate an amount equivalent to 100,000 pounds in British gold as relief funds, which will be managed and distributed by an international organization including Chinese members. The remaining balance of the silver is entrusted to the British government for safekeeping. It is stated in the above-mentioned statement of the Chinese government that (the British government is the trustee of the Bank of Communications and the Chinese government) in the British-Japanese plan on the silver issue, it is stipulated that after an amount equivalent to 100,000 pounds in British gold is allocated for North China relief purposes, the remaining silver should continue to be sealed until the British government and the Japanese government agree on other custody methods. However, China did not participate in the signing of the plan, and the various provisions in the Chinese-British exchange of notes on the silver issue cannot be changed without the consent of the Chinese government. Regarding the public notice on the Central Japanese police agreement, the Chinese government is well aware of the difficulties experienced by the British Concession police authorities in Tianjin. However, according to the provisions of the agreement, the Japanese side can interfere in the administration of the British Concession, and the content of the agreement is also inconsistent with the current agreements between the Chinese and British governments on the Concession, which is deeply regrettable. According to the British-Japanese plan on the currency issue, the British government has already allowed counterfeit currency to circulate in the British Concession in Tianjin. This move clearly harms China's interests and cannot implement the Far East policy that the British government has repeatedly declared it is willing to firmly maintain. Therefore, the Chinese government has declared its position to the British government on the above-mentioned commercial and currency measures agreed upon by the British and Japanese governments. (21st telegram)

Chongqing – After a long period of negotiations between the Chinese and British governments on the silver issue currently existing in the British Concession in Tianjin, it has been resolved and an agreement has been concluded. Today, the Chinese government issued the following statement on the agreement: "Regarding the silver currently existing in the British Concession in Tianjin, the Chinese government is willing to state the points repeatedly emphasized by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the British Ambassador in their recent talks on this matter, that is, the silver is owned by the Bank of Communications and is part of the legal currency reserve. The Chinese government hereby also states its following views. After the Chinese government allocates an amount equivalent to 100,000 pounds in British gold to be used for Chinese relief funds, the British government is the trustee of the Bank of Communications and the Chinese government for the rest of the silver. Therefore, the current agreed-upon method of sealing up the silver does not change the original state of the silver." (21st telegram)

### Unified Political Front: Roosevelt Reorganizes Cabinet; Stimson and Knox Appointed Secretaries of War and Navy; Congressional Figures Deeply Fear It Will Lead to War

Washington – President Roosevelt is currently taking steps to organize a mixed cabinet, recommending to the Senate the appointment of Knox, the Republican candidate who ran against him in the last presidential election, as Secretary of the Navy, and Stimson, Secretary of State under the Republican Hoover administration, as Secretary of War. The current Secretary of War, Woodring, and Secretary of the Navy, Edison, have both resigned. Edison, desiring to participate in the New Jersey gubernatorial election, submitted his resignation, which President Roosevelt accepted on June 4th.

It is generally believed that both Colonel Knox and Colonel Stimson are very capable, greatly strengthening President Roosevelt's cabinet. Their appointments prove the recent statements close to the White House that President Roosevelt's appointments of cabinet members are entirely motivated by ability. According to some sources, there may be opposition to President Roosevelt's ongoing organization of a mixed cabinet. It must be known that Stimson's opinions have already gained a majority of support within the Democratic Party, exceeding that obtained within the Republican Party, and Knox's acceptance of the appointment certainly does not follow the usual conventions of political parties. It is generally believed that Republican Senator Taft, or any other Republican with presidential aspirations, has no possibility of joining President Roosevelt's cabinet. (Reuters, 21st)

Washington – President Roosevelt, through his secretary Early, announced today that he has appointed Republicans to the cabinet to strengthen national defense, also stating that this move is in accordance with the majority's inclination towards national unity in a time of global crisis. (Reuters, 21st)

Washington – Regarding President Roosevelt's selection of Stimson and Knox, opinions in Congress state that the government is leading the United States into war. Both Knox and Stimson advocate for American assistance to the Allied countries. Colonel Stimson, in a speech in New Haven on Wednesday, requested that the United States open its seaports to accommodate the British and French navies, to reduce the need for the United States to send troops to Europe to fight Germany. Colonel Stimson's invitation into the cabinet is of great interest to people in the Far East and the islands. Mr. Stimson, during President Coolidge's term, served as Governor-General of the Philippines and expressed deep sympathy for the Philippines. The Western Pacific will also occupy an important position in the cabinet's considerations in Washington from now on. Also, as Secretary of State, Mr. Stimson vigorously created the American policy regarding Japan's invasion of Manchuria. It is generally believed that Colonel Stimson advocates for non-recognition of territory acquired by force, and was also the most active participant in taking embargo actions against Japan. As for the appointment of Knox, public opinion in the Midwest will certainly influence President Roosevelt's defense and foreign policy. (United Press, 21st)

Philadelphia – National Republican Chairman Hamilton declared that the renowned Republican figures Colonel Stimson and Colonel Knox have both been appointed by President Roosevelt to assume the most important positions in his cabinet, and are now loyal to President Roosevelt, and will henceforth speak and act in this capacity. Their desire for the United States to participate in European affairs has long been known, and this appointment further proves it. (Reuters, 21st)

Washington – Yesterday, people in Washington were taken by surprise by the appointments of Colonel Knox and Colonel Stimson to cabinet positions, and it has caused astonishment and comments. This move occurs only four days before the Republican National Convention to nominate a presidential candidate, and its impact is felt to be even more striking. Members of Congress are now discussing the implications of this move on President Roosevelt's political career. The immediate reaction from Congress seems to be largely disapproving. According to a certain senator who is expected to be nominated as the Republican presidential candidate, he believes that there is no reason to organize a mixed cabinet at this time, and he cannot recognize this as a type of mixed cabinet. Democratic Senator Clark expressed the opinion that this appointment is nothing less than a prelude to bringing the United States into the war. Democratic Senator Wheeler also stated that he believes Colonel Knox and Colonel Stimson would want the United States to assist the Allied countries to the extent of declaring war, and that both are strong supporters of President Roosevelt's foreign policy. (Reuters, 21st)

Washington – The appointment of Republican vice-presidential candidate Knox as Secretary of the Navy and former Democratic Secretary of State Stimson as Secretary of War has greatly attracted the attention of American political figures. The fact that members of the Democratic and Republican parties are holding important positions in the government together is a novel concept in American history. It is generally believed that President Roosevelt's reorganization of the government aims to establish a politically unified front to promote his new policies. Knox was born in 1874 and is the publisher of the "Chicago Daily News". He participated in the vice-presidential election in 1936. Stimson was born in 1867 and served as Secretary of War from 1911 to 1913 and as Secretary of State under President Hoover from 1921 to 1933. Stimson represented the United States at the London Naval Conference in 1930 and attended the Disarmament Conference in 1932. (Haitong Telegraph, 21st)

### Hull Delivers Speech: Strongly Criticizes Aggressor Nations; Urges Freedom-Loving Peoples to Unite and Form a Powerful Self-Defense Force

Cambridge, Massachusetts – Secretary of State Hull yesterday delivered a speech at Harvard University here, strongly criticizing isolationists and urging those who cherish freedom and freedom-loving nations to unite into an insurmountable self-defense force. Hull said, "Today is a dark day for the human race, because there is a powerful force at work, the importance of which is so great that if a country ignores it, it will inevitably fall into great danger. This force arises from the godless and soulless lust for power, attempting to enslave humanity and lead it into spiritual degradation, attempting to replace peace and orderly international relations with chaotic, violent, and barbarous force. The exertion of this force to such a strong degree that it can confront freedom and the progress of civilization has never been seen before. People and nations who cherish freedom and uphold the principles of modern civilization should gather every element of their spiritual and material resources, every ounce of their moral and physical strength, to form an insurmountable self-defense force. The urgency of this need has never been greater." Hull continued, saying that the history of the United States is not one of isolation from other human beings. Those who believe that their success can be maintained in isolation are thinking in a way that is extremely dangerous and foolish. In recent times, countries have been forced to surrender one by one, and have been ravaged and enslaved. The dark shadow of this threat extends to our continent, and is becoming darker day by day. The inner warning of self-preservation reminds us to be cautious. The test that the American people are encountering has never been more crucial. Hull concluded, saying that the independence of our country, and all the organizations that we love, cannot escape the challenge of the lust for power, which has been rampant on the face of the earth.

### "Japan Advertiser" Criticizes Italy; Angers Italian Embassy; Demands Duel with American Editor

Tokyo – Yesterday, the secretary of the Italian embassy, Cialea, challenged the editor of the "Japan Advertiser," Mr. Fleisher (an American), to a duel. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs here has not yet made any decision regarding the US Embassy's protest. The incident arose from Fleisher's statement in the newspaper's editorial yesterday that Italy's participation in the war was aimed at sharing the spoils. Cialea immediately went to Fleisher's residence and demanded that if Mr. Fleisher did not apologize within 24 hours, he would duel him with a short sword. Mr. Fleisher immediately reported this to the US Embassy here, and the American Embassy filed a protest with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

### British Aid China Committee Opposes British-Japanese Agreement; Another Proof of Britain Accommodating Japan

London - The "Aid China Movement Committee" issued a statement saying that the Tianjin agreement is another demonstration of Britain's policy of sacrificing China to appease Japan. The statement continued, "British policy is more willing to submit to Japan's intimidation than to actively cooperate with the Chinese people." The agreement is tantamount to recognizing Japan's occupation of that vital part of China and a British violation of the Nine-Power Treaty. The statement also said that famine has occurred in the Japanese-invaded North China area, much of which is the fault of Japan, and now the funds of the central government will be used to reduce Japan's heavy burden in the area.

### Japan Seizes on European Chaos; Peering into Vietnam; Anti-British and Anti-French Sentiments Run High Among Tokyo Public Groups

Tokyo – Japanese newspapers are becoming more blatant in their attitude towards Vietnam. The "Asahi Shimbun" wrote today that France's acceptance of Japan's demands regarding Vietnam is tantamount to closing the Yunnan-Vietnam border. The report emphasized that there will be obvious restrictions on Chinese people passing through, and it will actually be impossible for Chinese leaders to travel to foreign countries via Vietnam. Japan's acceptance of the French response this time has resolved the negotiations to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's activities in Vietnam. (Reuters, 21st)

Tunxi – The riverbank mobile artillery has been extremely active in recent days. On the morning of the 18th, a Japanese medium-sized warship sailed upstream and was suddenly attacked by Chinese artillery near the Dongliu River west.

### Full Text of President Chiang's Speech

(Continued from yesterday) Since the large-scale air raids on Chongqing by Japanese aircraft, all departments have continued their work as usual and stepped up their efforts, and the planning for various protection and relief undertakings has been very experienced by all responsible comrades. I personally don't have to distract myself with this, and you don't need to wait for me to constantly supervise the businesses you are in charge of. I hope everyone can

In accordance with the laws and plans, and understanding my intentions, everything can be done according to my daily resolutions and instructions, one by one. It must be known that no matter what kind of danger or difficulty, as long as we have the spirit, the determination, and are willing to work hard and strive, there is no reason why we cannot overcome it. For example, the Japanese planes have repeatedly attacked Chongqing, with 110 or even 160 planes. Our air force, with revolutionary spirit and revolutionary technology, can fight one against a hundred and win more with less. We must all have this spirit and ability to complete our revolutionary nation-building cause in this great era. You have probably seen the leaflets distributed by Japanese planes these past few days. From this, we can discern the Japanese army's bombing intentions and their purpose. Their wishful thinking is truly laughable. The Japanese think that these leaflets can

Shake our people's hearts, force our people to submit to them and surrender, but in reality, it only demonstrates the boredom of the Japanese. I have often said that the Japanese warlords still treat the current Chinese people as foolish and naive as they did more than 40 years ago during the Sino-Japanese War. They treat our current people as still having no ambition, no courage, no national concept, no national consciousness, not recognizing their enemies, and not recognizing their own government. Therefore, they always treat us as a foolish and inferior nation, thinking that they can deceive us at will, invade us at will, and use counter-propaganda to threaten us with violence and make us obey. They don't think about the fact that if our current people could be incited by Japanese counter-propaganda, how could China have resisted for three years to this day? We can

Honestly reply to the Japanese and say, (To this day, moving a mountain is easy, but shaking the will of the Chinese people to resist is truly beyond words). I remember telling you something before, that is, in the first month of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), when Wang Jingwei was still in Hankou, he talked to several comrades about the current situation one day, and Wang said, (We might as well take advantage of Germany's mediation, make concessions to the Japanese, and make peace with Japan). At that time, I said, This is absolutely impossible. If we seek peace with Japan now, there will only be submission, and no peace to speak of. The result will inevitably be completely at the mercy of Japan, and there will be no freedom for generations to come. Therefore, we must think of our descendants and only seek survival from death in order to obtain a bright future. Even if we fail, no matter where we retreat, even if we only have the land of one province or one county, as long as we can adhere to the Three Principles of the People, persevere unyieldingly, and fight to the end, we firmly believe that we will eventually be able to

Recover lost territories and achieve victory. At that time, I also used the cup of water on the table as an example and said to him, If we can resist unyieldingly, no matter where we retreat, even drinking a cup of cold water is free. Even if we breathe in a breath of air in the rubble and dust, we feel free. Otherwise, look at the compatriots in the occupied areas and the Northeast now. Everyone in their homes is not allowed to put on the door bolts every night. The Japanese can come in and take things at will. Whenever they want to confiscate your property, they confiscate it. Whenever they want to harm your life, your life is in danger. In any place occupied by the Japanese army, everything you have belongs to them. It not only makes all our compatriots uneasy day and night, but also all our lives and property are

Without any guarantee, we are truly fish and meat on the chopping block. In this situation, without any freedom, is it not worse than death? What is the purpose of our lifelong revolution? What is the purpose of implementing the Three Principles of the People? Several comrades present today have heard these words. Now that the War of Resistance has reached today, the Japanese are bombing Chongqing, thinking that this will make the Chinese people resent the government from now on. They don't know that our three-year national policy of resistance is that the National Government, in accordance with the Three Principles of the People, leads the people of the whole country in the struggle of resisting Japan and building the nation. At the same time, our resistance is entirely the unanimous demand of the compatriots of the whole country. If it weren't for

The people support the government, maybe we wouldn't have come to Chongqing today, and the people wouldn't be so enthusiastic in loving and supporting the government as they are today. Even if they endure hardships, they are willing to do so. The War of Resistance has been going on for three years, and the people of Chongqing have been bombed by Japanese planes for more than two years. The able-bodied serve together, save the dying and heal the wounded. This is a manifestation of love and mutual assistance, which really makes me very excited. Not only are the able-bodied like this, but even the general elderly, weak, women, and children, when they enter the air-raid shelters line by line, besides resentment, do you see any fear on their faces? This is the best test for our Chinese nation. Our nation has the spirit of revival, which can be tested and determined here. Whether our government and people have the integrity of fighting against a common enemy and whether they can endure hardships and tempering can also be tested and determined here. I believe that after this tempering, we

The whole country will only have a deeper understanding and unity. The strength of our country will only increase day by day. We will use the blood of our fallen soldiers and compatriots, and the anger of the War of Resistance, to create a brand new China. Therefore, the Japanese use force to threaten us, even if they bomb Chongqing, our people will always be in Chongqing, willing to share life and death with our government and share difficulties together. The relationship between the government and the people, this kind of interconnectedness and unity of life, is something the Japanese vainly try to destroy, only to see their efforts fail and their plans go wrong. It's like trying to catch the moon in the water. However, our general senior government officials must suffer their hearts and be loyal, and must share hardships and life and death with the general public. They must not be separated from the public, or even forget the suffering of the public. Recently, for the Chongqing air defense and rescue issues, I have to write more than five hundred words of instructions every day. What I keep in mind is why? It is for this reason. I hope that all responsible comrades from the Party, government, military, and police circles will carry forward the revolutionary spirit,

Encourage revolutionary character, and do their duty with conscience to rescue the afflicted compatriots and alleviate their suffering. Only then will they be worthy of being followers of the Premier (Sun Yat-sen) and worthy of being followers of the revolution. In short, now that the War of Resistance has reached this point, the final victory is already in our hands. The first basis is our magnet tactics, which have attracted the Japanese, preventing them from intervening in the European war during the European war period, seeking profit from the chaos. Secondly, our War of Resistance has the assistance of allied countries, and this is the most powerful allied country. Neutral from the European war, it uses all its strength to help us. This is an invisible guarantee of our victory. Everyone should also know the supreme value of our War of Resistance this time. The European war has obviously been affected by us. As for

The Far East, we have served as the vanguard of the Asian countries, which goes without saying. At the same time, we have also become the flank and rear guard of the Soviet Union and the United States. The influence of our War of Resistance on international relations and the Pacific is so great that it is truly unprecedented in ancient and modern history, both at home and abroad. At this stage of final victory, everyone should work hard, invigorate the spirit, and develop untapped talents to complete our historical mission. This is what I encourage myself with, and it is also what I encourage all comrades with. I hope everyone will work hard day and night to complete our mission of realizing the Three Principles of the People and achieve our goal of resisting Japan and building the nation.

Few peasant women remained, so they had to transport 70,000 agricultural workers from the colonies. However, the work efficiency of these people is weaker and does not help the matter.

In the case of England, after the government squandered food and indulged itself for six months, Lloyd George warned, "Starvation is in sight. We rely on foreign countries for 16% of our food. Today's consumers are five million more than in 1918, but there are one million fewer ships. Ships sunk by the enemy are double the number in the first six months of 1914. Every man and woman in England, every acre of land, is essential to victory." After Lloyd George's loud call, three million acres of aristocratic grassland were designated for cultivation.

In the first four months of the current European war, prices in England rose by 28%, which was 70% higher than in 1914. By February of this year, residents over the age of six were only receiving a weekly ration of one pound of meat, four ounces of butter, and twelve ounces of sugar. England originally imported food from Denmark and Norway, accounting for 12%, mainly cured meat and butter. This source has now been cut off.

Today, there are about 30 million soldiers in Europe holding weapons. It takes twice as many workers working all day to supply them with clothing, food, and ammunition. These 90 million strong men have been forced to abandon peaceful production, and their lives are disrupted. The most important thing is that the normal cultivation and distribution of food will inevitably be hindered. Even under the best of circumstances, the European agricultural economy is always struggling. Now that the European people have encountered the difficulty of even filling their stomachs, and the war is intensifying, what their situation will be in a year is unimaginable.

In summary, Europe will face famine. Since humans are born with the instinct to survive, revolution will inevitably follow, which is predictable. (Translated from the June issue of Readers Digest)

### Hunan Provincial Government Cultivates Medical Talents

Leiyang: In order to complete the health organizations at all levels below the county, the Hunan Provincial Government has temporarily established township health centers and increased the number of health workers in order to improve public health. However, there is an extreme shortage of medical and nursing talents here. It is specially planned to establish a medical vocational school starting from the second half of this year, with a starting cost of 11,000 yuan. Preparations are being actively made, and it is planned to increase the number of medical student scholarships starting next year. (20th dispatch)

### Bad Years Always Follow Wars: Europe on the Brink of Famine (Continuation) (End)

In the past, warring countries relied on neighboring non-warring countries for food. The most profound impression of this reporter's trip to Europe was that neutral countries not only cannot supply the warring countries, but it is also uncertain whether they can supply themselves. Because neutral countries are threatened by war, they must abandon their normal lives and engage in military preparations. The strong men who produce have become unemployed who wear military uniforms. These people are full all day long, and there is nothing to do for a while.

Germany organized a large-scale "food front" seven years ago. However, to the best of its ability, it was only enough to make Germany 18% self-sufficient in food. This ratio is decreasing day by day due to large-scale war preparations. Before the invasion of Poland, the German government announced that it had stored 8.6 million tons of grain, but its normal consumption exceeds 25 million tons per year.

Last winter was the coldest in ten years. Many vegetables in Germany were destroyed by military frost, causing a major blow to Germany. The canned food industry for emergency use has been distributed to the army. The rich food-producing areas of Poland have been devastated by war, leaving only hundreds of thousands of starving people. Fishing grounds have also been closed due to the war. Argentina has always been an important source of wheat for Germany, but now Germany has to rely on the Balkan Peninsula. However, most of the soil on the peninsula has not been cultivated. It is beyond human power to prevent Germany from repeating the great famine of 1918.

What about the Soviet Union? The Soviet Union produces the most wheat in the world, but famines occur frequently, second only to India and China. The famine of 1932 to 1933 was repeated at the beginning of this year. Farmers flock to cities to make a living, which is an ominous sign. Travelers taking trains out of the city are all searched by the police to prevent food from being smuggled out.

England and France are becoming more and more industrialized, no different from Germany at the beginning. France is known for its frugality, and most of its food is supplied by tens of millions of small farmers. But reducing its limited food supply will inevitably immediately endanger public health. By the beginning of this year, France began to stipulate that meat should not be eaten on certain days, and oral rations soon appeared. A portion of France's food is consumed by 200,000 Spanish refugees and 1 million German refugees. During grain planting, many women go to munitions factories,

### The United States Strengthens its Far East Policy, Which Stabilizes the Situation in Shanghai. After this, there is no need to worry about the safety of the concessions. The Chinese unanimously praise Mr. Stimson.

Since the expansion of the European war, rumors in Shanghai have been rampant and fleeting, like waves and unpredictable clouds, making people dizzy. However, in a short period of time, they are mostly clarified by the facts. Yesterday, a certain Chinese expert on Japanese affairs told the reporter, "All rivers run into the sea." Although there are many rumors, they all come from the same source, which is Japan's ambition for the concessions. Opportunism, pragmatism, and aggression are Japan's traditional diplomatic principles. Although Japan has the intention of speculation with the expansion of the European war, it is unable to extricate itself. Therefore, while raising the flag of "non-intervention in the European war," it is also eyeing the Dutch East Indies like a tiger, trying to take advantage of the gap. However, due to the strict monitoring of the United States, although it is drooling for thousands of feet, it does not dare to touch it. Therefore, it retreats and seeks the second best, trying to take advantage of the troubles in Western Europe and focus on the Shanghai concessions. The rumor that "the French concession will be transferred to the United States, and various countries will implement the withdrawal of troops" is its arrow of attack. The purpose is to use rumor offensive as a stepping stone to test the wind. However, various countries have long been determined to maintain the status quo in the Far East, so the rumors have been defeated without attack. Yesterday, according to news from Washington, Stimson's appointment as Secretary of War and Knox's appointment as Secretary of the Navy, with members of both the Republican and Democratic parties entering the cabinet at the same time, proves that the United States' policy towards the Far East will become more active. Then, the safety of the Shanghai concessions is more guaranteed.

### Chinese praise Mr. Stimson

Yesterday, people in this port expressed a warm and excited attitude towards the United States' formation of a coalition cabinet and the appointment of Mr. Stimson as Secretary of War, expressing their sincere welcome. Because Stimson is well known in the hearts of the Chinese as one of the most visionary figures in the American political circle. His attitude is extremely serious, and he is known for his opposition to aggression. During the September 18th Incident, Mr. Stimson advocated a tough response against Japan. Unfortunately, at that time, he did not get the full cooperation of the United Kingdom, which led to Japan's unbridled invasion of China and its attempt to dominate the Far East. Mr. Stimson recently published an article advocating close cooperation between the British and American navies. All American seaports should especially allow British warships to berth for coal replenishment and repairs, so that the power of the British Navy can control the entire Atlantic Ocean, while the US Navy can concentrate on the Pacific Ocean in order to respond to the situation in the Far East. Therefore, authoritative figures from all walks of life in China believe that Mr. Stimson's entry into the US government and taking up important positions is a clear proof that the United States is strengthening its Far East policy. It will surely be able to achieve considerable success in curbing the ambitions of aggressors coveting the South Pacific and clarify the sinister situation in the Far East. The United Kingdom, learning from its previous experience, should cooperate more closely with the United States to stabilize the Far East, which is also to stabilize the world situation.

Consular Leaders are About to Change

According to the reporter's inquiry at the Consulate General yesterday, the Consular Leader of this port, Mr. Niro, the Italian Consul General, has been promoted to a diplomatic position by the Italian government and will leave Shanghai before the end of summer. After that, the appointment of the Consular Leader has become a question. According to the opinions of some observers, after Niro leaves Shanghai, the most likely successor to the position of Consular Leader is Brazilian Consul Mei Yi. Italian Consul General Niro is scheduled to go to North China next Tuesday for a short rest, and then come to Shanghai to announce his resignation and solve the problem of the successor to the Consular Leader. In peacetime, the selection of the Consular Leader is based on the consul who has been in office for the longest time. However, at present, since the Sino-Japanese War, Shanghai has constantly encountered many complicated problems, so it is necessary to have a capable diplomat with the prestige of a major country as background in order to avoid any mistakes. In the past year, the position of Consular Leader has changed hands several times due to the European countries being successively involved in the vortex of the European War. In terms of the number of years in office, there are Danish Consul General Hill, Dutch Consul General Bau Siwen, Guatemalan Consul General Nuojiela, and Cuban Consul General Pang Naiqi above Brazilian Consul General Mei Yi. However, the consuls general of Denmark and the Netherlands do not want to take on the position of Consular Leader because they have actually lost their status as neutral countries. The consuls of Cuba and Guatemala are not subject to consular jurisdiction in China. Therefore, it is generally believed that the position of Consular Leader will belong to the Brazilian Consul General, because Brazil is one of the major countries in South America, is currently a neutral country, and has a consulate court in China.

Troops from various countries get along peacefully

Since Italy's participation in the war, in order to prevent friction between soldiers due to emotional conflicts, Shanghai has specially stipulated banquet areas to prevent frequent contact and incidents. Yesterday, the reporter saw two British soldiers and four Italian soldiers walking on the sidewalk near the Racecourse and the Great Light Theater. Four American soldiers, each wearing a pistol, were between the British and Italian soldiers as isolation, and an American military officer walked beside them to take charge of the command and care. The British and Italian soldiers were unarmed, with a peaceful attitude, and there was no emotional agitation. The open space at the corner of Daxi Road and Difeng Road was originally owned by the Public Works Bureau. It was previously sold to the Italian General Association and has now been opened as a sports field. Recently, the flags of Germany and Italy have been erected high. The flags of the German Party School on Daxi Road are also swaying in the wind. Since the outbreak of the European War in September last year, the school has not often hung its flags. This time, it may be to celebrate the victory of the European war.

### The Coastal Defense has been Completely Unblocked. Taikoo and Jardine Shipping Resume Normal Routes. Passenger Tickets are on Sale and Goods are being Loaded.

The Shanghai coastal defense route has been the main hub of commercial transportation in recent times, with a very important relationship. Since the expansion of the European war, the Japanese army, on the pretext that there were munitions transported to China via the coastal defense, warned the French ambassador to Japan and the consul in Hong Kong by the Japanese government. In order to prevent this, the French government announced on the 18th that it would temporarily block the Saigon coastal defense.

Temporary Suspension of Navigation

The Hong Kong-Vietnam route shipping first suspended navigation. On the 19th, the British companies Jardine Matheson and Taikoo received telegrams from Hong Kong, ordering the Shanghai coastal defense shipping to be temporarily suspended. However, the Taikoo Jinan wheel had already left the port at noon on the 19th, and a telegram was sent to the ship to wait for orders after arriving in Hong Kong. Jardine Matheson's Yusheng wheel announced the suspension of navigation to coastal defense, and passenger tickets and goods were temporarily refunded. The ship left Shanghai at noon the day before and sailed to Hong Kong. It is still on the way. The day before yesterday (20th), it was also reported that the coastal defense blockade had been lifted. Inquiries were made to Jardine Matheson and Taikoo. The closure of the coastal defense was only a rumor and there was no confirmation.

Lifting of the ban yesterday morning

Until 10:00 am yesterday morning (21st), the two companies received a notice from the Central Navy authorities, allowing each wheel to travel to coastal defense. Taikoo Company does not have a ship sailing to coastal defense this week, but it must be on the 19th (there is a Qingyuan theory from Shanghai to Zha Port, Guangzhou Bay, Haikou, and Coastal Defense. On the same day, the Jiaying wheel sailed from Shanghai to Xiamen, Shantou, Hong Kong, Tu Le, (transliteration), and Xihuang, ,). Since the two wheels have not yet arrived in Shanghai, the closure to Gongfang is still far away and not very concerned.

Jardine Matheson Resumes

However, Jardine Matheson has the Lisheng wheel this Sunday (22nd), sailing from Shanghai to Hong Kong Coastal Defense. Next Wednesday (26th), there is also the Mingsheng wheel, also sailing to Hong Kong Coastal Defense. Because of the urgency of the date, the sale of tickets and loading of goods are related, so they are very concerned. Yesterday morning, in addition to receiving a notice from the British Navy, they immediately telegraphed the Hong Kong head office. They received a reply telegram yesterday afternoon, saying that the coastal defense closure had been lifted. The Taisheng wheel, which left Shanghai the day before and arrived in Hong Kong to sail to Coastal Defense, was waiting for orders in Hong Kong. It has left Hong Kong and sailed to Coastal Defense yesterday (21st). The company's Hesheng wheel is scheduled to sail to Hong Kong Coastal Defense, and coastal defense passenger tickets are now available for sale and goods are also being loaded.

### Restriction of Rent Increases Still Under Discussion. The Two Concessions Cooperate in Handling this Matter. The Written Proposal is Suspended.

Both the Public Concession and the French Concession will increase municipal taxes starting next month. The French Concession Taxpayers Association has elected four representatives, including two owners and two tenants, to seek the approval of the French authorities in order to contact the authorities and jointly seek a fair and reasonable solution. As for the Public Concession, the Chinese Directors have also made written suggestions to the Concession authorities. However, according to the reporter's inquiry at the Pingming Society yesterday, the Public Works Bureau's Chinese Directors have now decided to suspend the written suggestions, because it has been agreed that the Chinese representatives of the French Concession will discuss with the French authorities on the method of restricting rent increases, and then the Public Works Bureau will decide to cooperate with the French Concession and take the same steps. However, the residents are anxious to settle the dispute over restricting rent increases as soon as possible because the tax increase is about to be implemented.

### French Commemorate Frontline Soldiers. The Situation is Tragic. A Grand Mass is Held at Saint-Louis School.

At 8:15 am yesterday, the Saint-Louis Church in the French Concession held a large-scale mass to commemorate the merits of the French soldiers who sacrificed for the country on the front line. At that time, the relatives of the soldiers in Shanghai and most of the French in Shanghai participated, and the situation was extremely tragic.

British Savings

The Shanghai British War Savings Association, chaired by the British Consul General George in this port, announced that the association has been prepared and will soon start work. Regarding this matter, the association will publish a special notice in the local newspaper at the end of next week. Major Holland, a basic member of the Royal Air Force Association, will soon leave Shanghai and return to England to serve the country. Mr. Holland made great achievements in the last war. This time, he returned to the country to participate in the war. Mr. Holland's relatives and friends in this port specially hosted a farewell banquet for him. At the banquet, Sir Sassoon made a brief farewell speech and presented Mr. Holland with a large silver cup as a souvenir.

### Opportunistic Price Gouging on Rice and Coal Provokes Universal Indignation; Market Prices Change Instantly, Entirely Manipulated; Distorted Justifications Make the Intentions Especially Unforgivable

Recently, stimulated by the European situation and the tense situation in Vietnam, some rice merchants with ulterior motives have spread rumors that the supply of foreign rice will be cut off, causing rice prices in the city to rise by several dollars a day, creating panic. Most strangely, coal merchants have followed suit, raising the price of coal briquettes again, which has a major impact on people's livelihood. Various public organizations have expressed strong indignation at this market phenomenon, unanimously believing that the city's rice and coal reserves are both substantial, and that the rumors spread by unscrupulous merchants are completely untrustworthy. Citizens should remain calm and not be fooled. It is hoped that the authorities in the foreign concessions will strictly suppress the price of daily necessities and thoroughly eliminate the manipulation by unscrupulous merchants. The proposal previously made by Chinese Director Mei Yu that all businesses must apply before raising prices, in order to show restrictions, has been noted by all parties in view of the fact that speculative merchants are still raising prices arbitrarily recently. It is hoped that the relevant public organizations will consult with the foreign concession authorities as soon as possible to implement this measure.

### Grain Industry Discussions

The Shanghai Doumi Industry Association held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of the 3rd session at its meeting hall at 15 Avenue Edward VII at 3 pm yesterday, resolving (1) that as rice prices continue to rise, methods should be found to suppress them; to discuss the proposal, it was resolved that in addition to Siam and Annam, where the purchase of foreign rice can still be shipped to Shanghai, more than 100,000 bags of rice purchased in Hong Kong are now subject to a definite export ban in Hong Kong, thus cutting off this source. A letter of preparation should be sent to the Public Works Department of the Concession, and four members, Zhu Zixiang, Chen Ziyi, Fu Qian Geng, and Zhang Nianying, should be delegated to pay a visit to request the British Consul-General to ask the Hong Kong authorities to dredge the matter. At the same time, the resolution to deliver payment within five days should be strictly implemented, and the resale should be restricted. At the same time, it is hoped that fellow merchants will report any violations, and once discovered, both buyers and sellers will be subject to the association's sanctions, or reported to the authorities for punishment, and a public announcement will be made to the market to strictly enforce it. (2) Whether to continue paying the donation for price stabilization on a fixed date, it was resolved to hold a meeting of the Price Stabilization Fund Raising Committee on a regular basis to decide.

### Preparations for Price Stabilization

The Shanghai Price Stabilization Committee held its tenth standing committee meeting at its meeting hall at 59 Guangdong Road at 3 pm yesterday. The chairman was Yu Qiaqing. The following important matters were resolved: As the city's rice prices have soared recently, handling price stabilization is a matter of urgency. This committee, having resolved to continue handling the matter at the previous full committee meeting, should actively proceed. In addition to the more than 15,000 bags of broken rice already in stock, it was decided to order 60,000 bags from abroad. Together with the stored rice, a total of 105,000 bags will still be handled in two phases. In addition to the 20,000 bags already ordered, another 40,000 bags will be ordered within the next few days. As a 50% deposit is required for this order, the required funds will exceed one million yuan. In addition to the efforts of the standing committee members to raise funds, there is still a shortfall. Those who have already pledged donations are urged to pay them off as soon as possible, and those who have not pledged donations are urged to pledge them as soon as possible, in order to achieve success. The date for opening sales is being prepared, and as soon as the ordered goods arrive in Shanghai, the Rice Industry Association will still be entrusted to handle the four phases of price stabilization.

### Fundraising Declaration

The Shanghai Price Stabilization Committee also issued a declaration stating that the committee has been handling price stabilization for four months. Because the funds have been exhausted and rice prices have been slightly stabilized, it has come to an end. Now, due to prolonged drought and the formation of early omens, rice-producing areas, such as Wuxi, require 45 to 50 yuan per stone of white rice. The city's rice prices continue to rise, and the trend is unstoppable. If price stabilization is not continued, not only will the general public be unable to feed themselves, but there is also a risk of taking risks. The Public Works Department is concerned about people's food, which has long been understood by the citizens. However, as it concerns the welfare of the people, the committee has to fulfill its duty to assist. The previous decision to carry out price stabilization deeply relies on the enthusiastic support of philanthropists who have donated funds in a steady stream. The first conclusion was that there were profits and no losses. This is indeed a blessing for the citizens, and it is also deeply felt by the colleagues of the committee. Now that the continuation is beginning, it is hoped that the enthusiastic donations will be as enthusiastic as before. It is especially hoped that those who have not yet opened their wallets will generously donate, so that the committee can collect enough funds to purchase as much as possible from abroad, so that rice prices can be suppressed during the period of crop transition, the general public will not be cut off from cooking, and local security may be slightly improved. This humble intention is only for the great figures of the city to consider it favorably, and it will be a great honor.

### Japanese Violence

The Continental Daily reported that it has been learned that Japanese naval police officers purchased military rice in Pudong last week. Rice merchants voluntarily stopped operations to show their opposition. Ten rice shop owners were arrested by the Japanese and forced to reopen and sell rice to the Japanese. Seven members of the Rice Industry Association were also detained, accused of inciting work stoppages.

### Current Coal Reserves

Most of the city's coal comes from Haiphong, Vietnam. Since the situation there has become tense, its price has also been gradually raised. However, the Shanghai defense line has not been interrupted, and coal is shipped to Shanghai by special ships, which has nothing to do with transportation by turns. Moreover, the output of the Kailuo and Kaiping Chinese coal mines has been increasing recently. In addition to supplying specific users, there may be a slight surplus of coal available for citizens to purchase. As for the city's coal reserves, according to the Public Works Department's investigation, the total number of coal reserves at the three coal yards in Pudong, Maigen Road, and Saposai Road is still in the tens of thousands of tons, and the coal reserves in smaller coal shops and coal yards have not been included at all. The reserves are the same as they were several months ago, which proves that the supply is sufficient to meet the needs. Moreover, coal companies have at least 20,000 to 30,000 tons of goods on order, and it is now summer, the weather is hot, and most factories have reduced their workload. For example, cotton yarn factories, electric bulb factories, and electric bead factories have either suspended operations due to difficulties in exporting due to the European situation, or due to sluggish sales. The amount of coal used has decreased by 14% compared to the winter. Therefore, there is no shortage of fuel.

### The Piasy to Sail Tomorrow; Danish Vessel Arrives This Morning

The American President Lines' President Piasy postal vessel is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Luzon and Hong Kong at 4 pm today, docking at buoys 12 and 13. The shuttle boat to pick up passengers will depart from the new customs wharf at 3:30 pm today, and will return to the new customs wharf at 5 pm to land the passengers. The President vessel is scheduled to set sail from Shanghai at 10:30 pm tomorrow (the 23rd), heading to Japan via Honolulu and returning to Los Angeles. The shuttle boat for seeing off passengers is scheduled to depart from the new customs wharf at 9 pm tomorrow night. The Danish Maersk vessel, recently approved by the US government after negotiating with the Central French Navy, is specially authorized to resume sailing and operate on its original Pacific route, still flying the Danish flag. The details have been reported in the previous Japanese newspaper. The first vessel to resume sailing from Luzon to Shanghai is the Niels Maersk, originally scheduled to arrive yesterday, but it is now heard that it will arrive this morning and dock at Xiao Dong Qichang Wharf. It is scheduled to resume sailing from Shanghai to the United States tomorrow (23rd). In addition, the French postal vessel General Joffre arrived in Shanghai from Marseille at dawn the day before yesterday (20th), docking at the Hongkou Shuntai Wharf. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Japan at 9 am tomorrow morning, before returning to Shanghai and returning to Europe.

### The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Letters to Various Trade Associations to Raise Donations for Price Stabilization in Shaoxing; The Close Commercial Relationship Between Shanghai and Shaoxing Cannot Be Ignored; Petitioning by Famine Victims in Sheng County Leads to Bloody Tragedy

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent letters to various trade associations yesterday regarding raising donations for price stabilization in Shaoxing, stating that they have received a letter from the Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association of the Seven Counties of Shaoxing, stating that the rice shortage in various counties of Shaoxing is serious and urging them to send letters to various trade associations to appeal for enthusiastic donations in order to overcome the difficulties together.

### Relationship between Shanghai and Shaoxing

It is found that the price of rice in Shaoxing is as high as one hundred and ten yuan per stone, and the famine situation is unprecedented. It is often heard that people are migrating to Shanghai, which not only makes it more difficult to find unemployment relief, but also makes the food and housing problem in Shanghai even more serious. At this time, if we can contribute as much as we can and collect enough funds to enable Zhejiang Province to carry out rice price stabilization, the people in Shaoxing will be spared from leaving their hometowns lightly, and the people in Shanghai will also benefit indirectly. Moreover, since the outbreak of the war, the commercial situation in Shanghai has become even more closely related to the interior of Zhejiang Province. Preserving the vitality of that place means increasing the commerce of Shanghai. It is hoped that your association will distribute the information to fellow merchants or raise funds as much as possible, or raise donations on behalf of others,

### Location for Payment

So that we can gather strength to handle price stabilization, reduce the fear of rice shortages, and relieve the distress of food shortages. The funds raised can be paid to the designated banks according to the public announcement of the Fellow Townsmen Association, including the Bank of China (Xiafei Road), Minfu Bank (Tianjin Road), Zhejiang Jianye Bank (Shanxi Road), Zhongyi Trust Company (Beijing Road), Anyu Money Shop (Ningbo Road), Baofeng Money Shop (Tianjin Road), Tongrun Money Shop (Tianjin Road), and HSBC (Henan Road), whichever is nearest.

### Tragedy in Sheng County

According to people from Sheng County, more than 40 people in the county gathered in the county government on the 3rd of this month to petition because of the soaring price of rice and the inability of the people to make a living. They made three requests: (1) Suppress the price of rice to four sheng per yuan, (2) Allow them to purchase rice at a reduced price from the price management office with yuan, (3) Severely punish hoarders and speculators. However, County Chief Fang perfunctorily dealt with the matter, and at 10 pm, there was no concrete reply. The petitioners then selected more than 10 representatives to see County Chief Fang, but County Chief Fang not only refused to meet them, but also arrested more than 10 representatives and sent armed soldiers to disperse the people by firing shots. As a result, more than 10 people were killed or injured, causing a bloody tragedy. The people of the county have become increasingly disgusted with County Chief Fang, and have telegraphed the provincial party headquarters, political and military circles to demand (1) the prompt release of the arrested representatives and compensation for the dead and wounded, (2) punishment of the perpetrators and a guarantee that the same incident will not happen again, (3) severe punishment of hoarders and speculators and genuine suppression of rice prices.

### Electricity Surcharge to Be Reduced Next Month

Da Guang She says that the Shanghai Power Company, due to the improvement in exchange rates recently, has decided to reduce the extra surcharge on electricity from July. The extra surcharge for lighting electricity will be reduced from 80.97% to 70.93%, and the electricity for heating will also be reduced from 316.12% to 250.43%.

### Rickshaw Passengers Should Increase Fares Appropriately

The Public Works Department has recently approved an increase of 15 cents per day per rickshaw for public rickshaw rentals. This will add an average burden of 7.5 cents per day to each rickshaw puller. The rickshaw pulling industry is different from other industries, because if expenses increase in other industries, they can automatically be passed on to customers. However, the fares paid by passengers for rickshaws cannot be regulated. Therefore, the Public Works Department hopes that those who ride rickshaws in the future will understand the hardship of the rickshaw pullers' lives and appropriately increase fares, so that the rickshaw pullers can cope with the above-mentioned new rickshaw rentals.

### Yu Qiaqing's 74th Birthday; Friends and Relatives to Hold Public Banquet Tomorrow

Yu Qiaqing, because of his leading position in the city's commercial and industrial circles, and his enthusiasm for public undertakings, has benefited countless residents of Shanghai. Therefore, everyone admires and respects him. Tomorrow (the 18th day of the fifth lunar month) is Yu Qiaqing's 74th birthday. He believes that in these extraordinary times, both public and private affairs, mental and material resources, should be conserved as an example. Therefore, Yu Qiaqing has declined all congratulations from friends and relatives. It is only heard that a few of Yu Qiaqing's closest relatives and friends will hold a banquet for him tomorrow to celebrate his birthday.

### Russian Terrorists Enticed to Shanghai by the Japanese; To Be Used by the Japanese to Implement Violence; Russian Emigrants in this Port Talk About It With Trembling

The 25,000 Russian emigrants in this port have been closely watching the development of the "New Russian Emigrant Organization" planned by the Japanese. The public believes that by the end of the month, although opinions among the Japanese are extremely divided, the "organization" will definitely be formally announced. According to reliable sources, the organization will replace the position of the old Russian Emigrant Association and imitate the old tricks of Harbin, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places. All Russian emigrants who do not participate will be expelled from the country. It is also said that the old organization will still exist. A final decision will be made soon. According to current reports, the Japanese consulate in this port and the economic department of the South Manchurian Railway are still in favor of Shiman, the leader of the existing Russian Emigrant Association, being the leader of the Russian Emigrant Organization. However, the special affairs department of the Japanese army and the Russian Emigrant Affairs Division have indicated that they must support the "New Russian Emigrant Organization" and use Jomengnago as a puppet. The so-called "New Russian Emigrant Organization" is likely to be stillborn. According to the Russian-language Ross newspaper, which is sheltered by the Japanese, the "new organization" could be established on the 15th of this month, and the old Russian Emigrant Association must cease its activities on that day. However, as a result, the "New Russian Emigrant Organization" has been postponed.

### Russian Emigrants Anxious

Russian emigrants are extremely anxious because once the "New Organization" is announced, their freedom will be deprived. The fear is extraordinary. They unanimously expressed their willingness to support the continued existence of the old Russian Emigrant Association. They understand that the "new order" in the mouths of the Japanese has become a terror in the Russian emigrant organizations of Ping, Jin, and Harbin. In Tianjin, a Russian emigrant named Funing was murdered by Japanese henchmen in the British concession and kidnapped to the Chinese territory. Although the murderer was arrested by the British, he was only sentenced as a suspect and released immediately because there was no Chinese court. Another Russian Jew named Fanbao was falsely accused of being a communist spy and imprisoned in a cellar, where he was severely tortured. Russian emigrants can still vividly recall such events.

### Terrorists

According to reliable reports, several Russian Japanese henchmen who were notorious in Pingjin and Harbin have reportedly arrived in Shanghai. One of them, named Pister Narnik, is a lawyer who was famous for committing a major crime. Another, named Postukin, once organized anti-communist groups in Pingjin and is also said to have come to Shanghai. There are still other such accomplices. Once the Japanese make a decision, they will inflict all kinds of violence on Russian emigrants in this port. According to another report, the highest floor of the association's meeting place at 409 Seward Road will be occupied by a Russian emigrant unit transferred by the Japanese army. The middle layer will be the Rato newspaper, which is sheltered by the Japanese. Because of this measure, the 25,000 Russian emigrants in this port have to face a new kind of terror.

### US Marshal's Prosecutor Returns to the United States for Vacation

The English-language Da Mei Wan Bao reported that Hills, the prosecutor of the Shanghai District of the US Marshal's Office in China, who has served for four years, is scheduled to return to the United States with his family on the 23rd of this month for vacation. According to Hills, he has known the new US Secretary of the Army Stimson and Secretary Knox for a long time, but he did not comment on the political impact of their new positions. Hills said that he was very happy to return home this time, and most of his time will be spent in Washington and his hometown of St. Louis, meeting with old friends. He will return to Shanghai with his family on December 3 of this year to resume his duties.

### Refugee Population Statistics

### Teacher Escapes With Female Students Under the Guise of Joining the Army; Refugee Changes Name and Teaches, Seduces Two Female Students and Attempts to Flee With Them

Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, there has been no shortage of young male and female students in this city who have extraordinary aspirations and actions, and who have fully embraced the lesson that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country. Therefore, the event of abandoning family and enlisting in the army has also been repeatedly discovered. This is indeed the natural duty that citizens should fulfill, and it is especially the great feat of people with lofty ideals, which should be admired by society. Unexpectedly, the world is becoming increasingly materialistic and treacherous. This great term of "enlisting in the army" has been exploited by profligate sons and immoral daughters. It is clear that it is a love affair between teachers and students, and they escape together, but they pretend to be enlisting in the army as a cover. The details are described as follows.

Wang Renqin and his wife, both middle-aged people from Ningbo, who live upstairs in the Wufeng Copper and Tin Shop at 265 North Jiangxi Road, south of Haining Road, have only one daughter, named Aizhen, who is 29 years old and beautiful. She is currently studying at the Public Security Primary School on Arerjin Road and is very close to her classmate Zhao Guomei, their relationship is better than sisters. Zhao is 28 years old, originally from Songjiang, and lives at 20 Fushou Lane, next to the Hui Si Police Station on Haining Road. Mingzheng, a teacher at the school, claimed to be Chen Chonghua when he was not teaching and lived with his wife in the Ci Yuan Refugee Shelter on North Zhejiang Road. After being hired by Public Security, he changed his name to "Mingzheng".

He repeatedly tried to seduce Wang and Zhao students. The two students thought that the teacher was treating them exceptionally well and sincerely edifying them, so they were happy to follow him, hoping to ask him questions at any time. Every weekend and holiday, Wang and Zhao often made excuses to go out and meet with Chen, either to watch a movie together or to visit a park together. The parents of the two girls were too indulgent and did not guard against it at first. However, teachers and students in the same school had already seen through their secrets and made complaints. For the sake of the school's reputation, the school authorities dismissed Chen Chonghua at the end of the last semester, still relegated to the status of a refugee. However, he still maintained close contact with the two students. This spring, he transferred Zhao to Shaoxing Middle School in the Shaoxing Fellow Townsmen Association on Aiyu Jin Road. From then on, Wang and Zhao no longer studied together, but they still traveled together, and Chen shuttled between the two beauties.

The seduction became more and more intense. On Sunday morning last week (the 16th), Wang Aizhen still went out alone on the pretext of visiting Zhao Guomei and did not return until dusk. While the girl's parents were panicking, Zhao Zhiming, Zhao Guomei's father, sent his second daughter to Wang's house to look for her sister. After inquiring with each other, they learned that Guomei had also left home alone that morning on the pretext of visiting Wang Aizhen. At that time, the parents of both parties immediately set out to investigate separately. As a result, they found that all the clothing and other personal items of the two girls had disappeared. They went to the Ci Yuan Shelter to investigate Chen Chonghua, who had been friends with the girl, but he was also nowhere to be found. Only Wang's wife was left in the shelter, claiming that her husband had left the shelter on the first of this month and did not know where he had gone. Only then did they realize that the teacher and the two students had planned this action,

Since the whereabouts are unknown, what else can they do? Unexpectedly, the postman suddenly delivered a letter, and after reading it, it was full of ornate and grand words, saying that they would now dedicate their bodies to the country and rush to serve on the front line. Please don't be sad, etc. The fathers of the two girls knew that it was a disguise and did not believe it, so they took the letter to the Hui Si Police Station to report it and request an investigation. On the 19th, they received a second letter from Changzhou, asking the parents not to pursue the matter any further, and saying that they were continuing to move forward. This kind of abduction can be said to be unprecedented.

### Robbery on Pingjili Road; Two Robbers Arrested One After Another

Ji Tingshen, a man from Ningbo, is about 40 years old and runs the Dechang Gunny Sack Shop at 61 Pingjili Road in the French Concession. He lives in the pavilion on the second floor of the Senda Copper and Tin Shop at 57 Futong Road. At 7:15 yesterday morning, two robbers holding weapons suddenly broke into the shop owner's residence and stole 30 yuan in legal tender. At that time, Huabu No. 9 of the French Police Station was on duty there and immediately followed and arrested the robbers after hearing the alarm. One of the robbers fled to the entrance of Guoren Temple on Vilmont Road, where he was shot in the leg by the police and surrendered. The stolen goods and a fake pistol were found on him. The other robber escaped, but at noon, the Public Concession Police Station captured the escaped robber on Chengdu Road based on a tip from an informant.

### Lacquer Factory on Jaxiyi Road Destroyed by Fire Yesterday

The Aolima (transliteration) Chemical Lacquer Factory at 200 Jaxiyi Road in the French Concession is quite large in scale. At 8:40 yesterday evening, the factory suddenly caught fire, and thick smoke quickly spread. The Tianran MSG Factory at 44, Lane 210 behind the factory was also affected, and part of the building was destroyed by the fire. After receiving the report, the Fire Brigade drove to the scene to put out the fire. However, because all the raw materials in the factory were extremely flammable, although the firefighters tried their best to put out the fire, the fire was too strong, and it was difficult to put it out. It was not completely extinguished until about 12 o'clock, so the extent of the loss could not be investigated. It was also heard that five or six people escaped from the fire, and were burned by the fire.

### Hunger-Stricken People in Hongkou Grab Rice

At 8:20 last night, while a rice shop at 934 East Youheng Road in Hongkou was closing, more than 80 poor people suddenly rushed in and grabbed 14 bags of white rice stored in the shop and fled. One person was arrested on the spot by Huabu and taken to the police station for questioning.

### Robbery on Bailinan Road

At 2:30 yesterday morning, a number of robbers broke into the Baimu Industrial Company at 33 Bailinan Road, Huxi, and tied up the staff. More than 3,000 yuan was stolen. When they left, the robbers fired several shots to show their power. It is heard that the company was established by Japanese, and one staff member was injured when the robbers fired.

### Mr. Liu Accused of Unpaid Tuition; Reader Offers Assistance; Zhen Dong Principal Insists on Suing for Recovery; Mr. Guo Pengfei Generously Covers the Shortfall

Yesterday's newspaper reported that Liu Shusheng, a Ningbo native residing at No. 267, Jin Yu Li, Min Ti Ni Yin Road, is currently working as a runner for Chinese medicine. He has two daughters, the elder named Fengying (15 years old) and the younger Yunying (12 years old), both studying at Zhen Dong Primary School near the intersection of Glock Road and Pi Shao Nai Road. Fengying is in the fifth grade, and Yunying is in the third grade. Both students are extremely intelligent and consistently rank first in every exam. However, due to the impact of the war, Liu's financial situation has become exceptionally dire, leading to a total tuition debt of twenty-one yuan for both students this semester, which he is unable to pay. He further sent a letter to the school requesting an extension, but the school did not show understanding. Instead, the principal, Fan Shentai from Wuxi, provided a guarantee to the Second Special Court to forcibly apply for a preliminary attachment, sealing Liu's house and furniture. Simultaneously, a lawsuit was filed in the civil court to demand the payment of twenty yuan and one yuan in fees. The case has already been summoned, ordering both parties to reconcile outside the court and reschedule the hearing.

Reader's Letter: Generously Offering Tuition Assistance

Mr. Liu's being sued for his children's unpaid tuition is truly pitiable. The fact that Principal Fan of Zhen Dong Primary School is resorting to litigation for a mere tuition fee is deplorable. Mr. Guo Pengfei, a reader of this newspaper, is willing to cover the outstanding amount for Mr. Liu. We are publishing the original letter as follows: "To the esteemed editors, I have read the report in your newspaper's social section on the 21st, concerning Mr. Liu Shuming being sued by the principal of Zhen Dong Primary School for owing twenty-one yuan in his children's education fees, and the subsequent sealing of his house and furniture. Besides being saddened by the growing trend of mercenary education on this isolated island, I cannot help but feel immense sympathy for Mr. Liu. Mr. Liu can be said to have done his utmost in educating his children, setting an example for parents in our country. Therefore, despite being subjected to the pressures of high-cost living (as I am not wealthy, but rather an unemployed candidate who has not been out of school for long), I am willing to send the eleven yuan that Mr. Liu has yet to raise to your newspaper's editorial office, so you may kindly notify Mr. Liu to collect it. If any issues arise with the remaining ten yuan, I am also willing to do my best to manage it within a day or two. Thank you for your detailed attention. Sincerely, Guo Pengfei, 21st." (Editor's Note: Mr. Guo's kindness and chivalrous spirit are truly admirable. We kindly request Mr. Guo to send his donation to our editorial department at the newspaper before 9 p.m., and then a special messenger from our newspaper will deliver it to Mr. Liu.)

The Principal Claims: "I Have a Clear Conscience"

Furthermore, according to a letter from Tao Ran, a lawyer representing the principal of Zhen Dong Primary School, "To whom it may concern, Fan Shenxiong of Zhen Dong Primary School hereby states that upon reading the news column of your newspaper titled "Unpaid Tuition Fees" "Actually Leads to Lawsuit," the content is inconsistent with the facts. Upon investigation, the Liu surname's two students who studied at our school should have paid ninety-nine yuan in total tuition, book fees and miscellaneous fees. In addition to the three yuan scholarship from the last semester of Liu Fengying, we also followed the student's parents' request to reduce five yuan in tuition fees, and deferred payment. Our school is private and the funding is very stretched. However, we are still able to accept the student's parents' request to reduce the fees and defer payment. In terms of our educational position, we can say that we have a clear conscience. The school term is coming to an end, and Mr. Liu has repeatedly procrastinated and made excuses verbally and in writing with regard to paying the fees for his children. Therefore, on May 17, our school's consultant lawyer Tao Ran sent a polite letter urging payment. In the middle, Mr. Liu's representative, lawyer Peng Qixiu, made an informal request to reduce the fees again and pay a portion. At that time, he fully agreed, but unexpectedly, after the request, he broke the appointment. Therefore, we had to proceed with the lawsuit. Before the court hearing, Mr. Yu Ting, Xu Wufang, and others persuaded us to be more lenient and waive most of the fees. Our school principal, Mr. Fan, and his agent lawyer, Tao Ran, bearing in mind our education stance, tried to accommodate the public opinion and accepted the advice. At the time, it was said that everything would be paid in full at once, but when he went to court, he still asked to pay the amount agreed upon by Lawyer Yu in installments. Therefore, our school principal, Mr. Fan, rejected it in court, as he thought that he was getting an inch and wanting a mile and did not know that the citizens should help the development of the school, and should be responsible for the expenses of their children's education. This is a matter concerning our school's reputation, and we are especially sending a letter to correct the facts. Based on this, please publish it in your newspaper for verification, so as to clarify the actual situation. Sincerely, To the chief writer of the Shen Bao, lawyer Tao Ran, June 21st."

### Finance: Frequent Negative News for Foreign Exchange

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw HSBC's listed prices fluctuating. The gray market for British and American currencies was showing a strong upward trend. First, the British currency stepped out of the four-dollar mark, and the US currency also loosened beyond six yuan. In the morning session, rumors suddenly arose that the US dollar was depreciating and that US Senator Stimson was appointed Army Chief, and that conflicts had broken out between Germany and the Soviet Union. As a result, people's confidence was shaken, and speculators kept selling. Hong Kong Electric remained the only major seller. At noon, the British currency reached its highest point at 4.03125 dollars. The market initially continued to loosen. The US dollar once reached 6.0625 yuan. Later, because HSBC suddenly agreed to absorb the currency, there were more buyers, and the market slightly turned around. But the final report of the US dollar's large price drop in Chongqing was seen as negative news by operators, and the market hardened again. As a result, the British currency was 4.03125 dollars, and the US currency was six yuan, compared with yesterday's closing price. The British currency weakened by 0.09375, and the US currency strengthened by 0.21875. The futures trend was the same as the spot market.

After the opening, the Bank of America's supply was particularly strong. The US dollar was sold for 5.8125, so the market immediately hardened. The White Silver Balance Tax was announced, reducing the white silver by 1.50%. Afterwards, Hong Kong Electric also came to sell, and Chinese speculators followed suit and sold off, and the potential became more relaxed. It was rumored that there was negative news from Europe, and there were also rumors that the US dollar was depreciating. At first, Hong Kong Electric sold US dollars for July at 5.75 to 5.78125 yuan. At the same time, speculators sold the same month's US dollars to foreign firms from 5.75 to 5.875 yuan. By noon, there was still a lack of support, and the headroom was unusually abundant, which caused the market to harden. This month, Hong Kong Electric sold British currency to HSBC for 4 dollars, and the lowest price seen was 4.03125 dollars. As a result, the British currency was 4 dollars and the US dollar was 6 yuan, which was 0.0625 dollars higher for the British currency and 0.21875 stronger for the US dollar than the morning's opening. The futures market was also relaxed.

The US Dollar Once Reached Six Yuan

### The Gold Market Suddenly Experienced a Sharp Decline, Hitting a Low of 5,320 Yuan

Yesterday's gray market for spot gold continued to decline, following the weak trend of the previous day. Because people were influenced by all kinds of negative news, such as the rumor that the United States was more actively assisting Britain, and the possibility of the United States participating in the war increased again, and there were various other negative rumors. The city's foreign exchange weakened, and gold prices also fell after. The morning opening price was 5,630 yuan. Zhongjin Money Exchange once tried its best to buy in, reaching 5,650 yuan. However, the sales of multiple gold houses were extremely fierce, and the price fell to a low of 5,410 yuan. However, the price recovered slightly to 5,460 yuan at noon. After the afternoon market opened, it was unable to support the price again. From 5,410 yuan, it fell to the bottom of 5,320 yuan. It was heard that a certain money exchange was forcefully killing multiple positions. Later, the gold houses and securities firms increased their purchases, and suddenly recovered to 5,540 yuan. As a result, the market closed at 5,485 yuan, which was 195 yuan lower than the previous day. After closing, the off-market price was only 5,440 yuan, and the potential was quite weak. The total transaction volume for the day was approximately 5,000 taels. The price of gold jewelry in silver shops also fell by 20 yuan. The price of customs gold remained the same.

Spot Gold Plummets by 200 Yuan

Since the morning, due to the weakening of foreign exchange, people's sentiments were still scattered and weak. The market opened and immediately fell by 50 yuan. A silver shop sold 30 taels to a gold house for 5,630 yuan. Because a certain silver shop sold off its multiple positions from the previous day, and retail investors also sold, although a certain money exchange bought heavily at that time, the headroom was still felt to be abundant. The price decreased by 25 yuan, and a silver shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange for 5,575 yuan. After that, there were fewer sellers, and the money exchange and a certain gold house scrambled to buy in, and the price once recovered to 5,650 yuan. However, the market suddenly spread negative news from Europe, and the exchange market became tighter, causing the selling trend to resume. The silver shops repeatedly sold heavily, and the silver jewelry industry also sold. Although the money exchange continued to increase its multiple positions at that time, it was no match for the crowd. The price fell by 110 yuan, and a silver shop did 20 taels to a money exchange for 5,540 yuan. At that time, the gold houses bought in, and the price recovered by 30 yuan. However, the exchange market was even tighter at noon, and the selling trend was difficult to stop. A certain money exchange's appetite weakened, and the price plummeted by 160 yuan. A silver shop did 20 taels for 5,410 yuan. Before closing, the gold houses and silver houses bought in, and the price recovered by 50 yuan. A gold house bought 20 taels from a silver shop for 5,460 yuan, as the closing price at noon. When the market opened in the afternoon, a certain money exchange suddenly thought about selling its multiple positions, and the exchange market reported tighter prices, and there was a lack of buyers. First, the money exchange sold 30 taels to a gold house, for only 5,410 yuan. Later, retail investors bought in, and although the price recovered slightly by 20 to 30 yuan, it was eventually suppressed by 100 yuan due to the multiple positions of a certain money exchange tending to sell off. A money exchange sold 50 taels to a gold house for 5,320 yuan. Later, due to the softening of foreign exchange, and there was talk of issuing treasury bills, buyers were excited for a while, and competed to buy in. At that time, a certain silver shop also bought in more than 200 taels, and the securities firms also bought in. Before long, the price recovered by 220 yuan. A securities firm bought 30 taels from a gold house for 5,540 yuan. After buying in, negative rumors suddenly spread, and the exchange market hardened again. The gold houses and securities firms turned to selling, and the price fell again by 55 yuan. A gold house sold 30 taels to a silver shop for 5,485 yuan, as the closing price in the evening. As a result, it decreased by 195 yuan compared to the previous day. After closing, the securities firms sold tens of taels, only reporting 5,440 yuan. The total fluctuation was 330 yuan. The selling price of the current gold houses' main brand gold was 10 yuan higher than the spot gold, and the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.

Jewelry Gold Listed at Only 560 Yuan

The initial selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops was still 580 yuan in Dahangtong. At 9:50 a.m., it was lowered by 10 yuan. At 11:45 a.m., it was lowered by another 10 yuan. At 2:10 p.m., it was lowered by another 10 yuan. At the same time, at 2:45 p.m., it recovered by 10 yuan. At 3:15 p.m., it recovered by another 10 yuan. At 3:30 p.m., it was lowered again by 10 yuan. As a result, it decreased by a total of 20 yuan. Dahangtong changed its listing to 560 yuan, and the new Hangtong was the same price. The buying price was reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Sharp Drop in Foreign Currencies

The foreign currency market yesterday saw spot gold trending downward. British and American gold pounds also fell slowly. There was no shortage of supply of British drafts, and the market price was very weak. Under the atmosphere of selling all day, the price of the American gold draft once fell to 16.15 yuan in the afternoon. It eventually closed at 16.4 yuan, which was still a sharp drop of 0.75 yuan compared to the previous day. The reason for the decline was that Stimson was about to become the Secretary of the Army, and the general public feared that the United States would join the war. The price of Hong Kong drafts continued to fall along with the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. There were supplies of Canadian and Philippine currency, and the market price was consistently weak. The demand for Japanese gold drafts decreased sharply, and the market price was slightly weak. The evening price was 1.08 yuan. The supply and demand of Korean drafts were balanced, and the evening price was 9.055 yuan.

### Discount Rate Greatly Relaxes, Down 13 Yuan Compared to the Previous Day

The discount rate for bills of exchange yesterday suddenly plummeted. The discount price per thousand yuan fell from around 90 yuan to a discount of 72 yuan and an issuance of 77 yuan. Later, it recovered to 80 yuan, with a discount of 75 yuan, a sharp drop of 13 yuan compared to the previous day. The interest rate for money trade association was listed as 2.6 points in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Securities: The Lonely Bond Market Was Slightly Lively Yesterday

The securities gray market rebounded slightly yesterday. Although the situation in Annam was tight, the rumors of the defense of Haiphong had been confirmed as untrue, and the sentiment improved slightly. In the afternoon, there were rumors that Stimson would become the Secretary of the Army, and morale improved slightly. Stimson had always advocated the policy of supporting China and suppressing Japan. Market trading became sparse. Datong continued to buy in. Yu Ru Defu, Jiufeng, and No. 25 all bought in, while Shengda, Lianhe, Yuxing, and Tongkang all cut their positions. Therefore, the market price wanted to rise but stopped, and the future was still fluctuating. The date of interest payment on July 31 was gradually approaching, but people still felt uneasy. Yesterday's market price uniformly rebounded by 0.51 to 0.15 yuan. The total transaction volume was only about 400,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below.

Stock Trading: 50 shares of Bank of Communications were traded at a price of 65 yuan.

The stock market actions of the Public Utilities Association yesterday were partly to cover short positions, but the potential was extremely firm, and the buying was exceptionally strong. If no special accidents occur, the market is expected to rise next Monday. Rubber stocks are still being ignored, but for certain long-abandoned stocks, the buyer's appetite is not bad.

### Yarn and Cotton: The Decline in Cotton Yarn Has Been Halted, Shuangma is Fluctuating Within the 1,000 Yuan Mark

The yarn market, which had fallen sharply the previous day, saw its speculative trend contained yesterday and showed some stability. It was recorded that ships on the South China Sea route from Hong Kong to Haiphong could still sail and that goods could still be loaded. This revived people's confidence. However, the concentration of Japanese warships in Tokyo Bay made it difficult for buyers to be fully enthusiastic. Therefore, the market price was still fluctuating within the 1,000 yuan mark.

The morning opening of the spot yarn market saw slightly better sentiment. 20-count Shuangma rose by 10 yuan, to a price of 980 yuan. Once the price reached 1,000 yuan, sellers rushed in, and the market price fell again in an instant. At the same time, the foreign exchange was also loosened, and the remaining prices also decreased, and the market was even more exhausted. The price fell to 940 yuan. It was then heard that a Guangbang, which had not been processed the previous day, was again being purchased yesterday, and the market situation immediately turned around, rising to 985 yuan. The closing price then weakened again. It was found that a total of 2,555 bales were traded in half a day, and the market price rose by 18 yuan. Today, 188 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 984 pieces to Tianjin, and 160 pieces to Yantai. The amount purchased by each bang is listed as follows.

### Cotton Has Become a Dead Market

The spot cotton market situation is extremely stagnant, and there is no demand from any party. The reason for this is that the goods purchased by the various companies are very sufficient. As for the factories, due to the depression in the yarn market, the purchasing power is very weak. Although people are optimistic, it is currently difficult to develop in reality.

According to another report, the price of foreign cotton in the New York cotton market initially experienced pressure from sellers. Later, due to short selling in the South and the closing of some long positions, the closing price fell by 0.18 or 0.19 pounds per sound for the near term, and 0.05 or 0.06 pounds for the long term. The Indian cotton market fell by 0.05 rupees along with the forecast yesterday.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading: The market is particularly quiet, and all parties are taking a wait-and-see attitude. The amount of cash is extremely tight, and the price of yarn has plummeted. The cotton market is affected by all parties and has become a dead market. According to the current situation, it is difficult to have a turnaround for a while.

### Food: Rice Prices Are Difficult to Lower, and the Sales of Glutinous Rice are Suddenly Booming

The turbulent tide of the rice market has stabilized yesterday. The various situations in Haiphong have been reported as inaccurate, and shipping continues to operate, so the source of goods should be sufficient. Speculators have lost their basis and can no longer make waves. Only the general sales of rural villages in the interior are still booming to meet emergency needs. The market was flat and tired in the early morning, and there was no change. Until the middle of the market, the prices of foreign rice of various colors returned to the highest peak of the previous morning. The first-class old Saigon was 66 yuan, and the second-class was 63.5 yuan. However, since the overall situation had fluctuated once, it was difficult to rise again, and it only fluctuated back and forth around this price. As the market was about to close, the retail and wholesale markets eased, and more goods were released, and the price fell by 0.5 yuan again. Therefore, the resulting closing market prices were 65.5 yuan and 65 yuan for the first-class old Saigon, 63 yuan for the second-class, 66 yuan and 65.5 yuan for the special grade, and 63 yuan for the second-class. In the afternoon, the price first rose and then fell, and after falling, it rose again, with several ups and downs. As a result, it was 0.5 to nearly 1 yuan lower than the previous evening. However, due to the new transactions not being settled for the returned goods, although shipping was said to be uninterrupted, people still hoped for a good price. The price of the hoarded goods was also rising, and the opened price of the second-class Siam rice loaded on the 18th was from 70.5 yuan to 71 yuan, and the price of the rice loaded on the 26th was from 67 yuan, 67.5 yuan to 68 yuan. The second-class Saigon was 66 to 67 yuan. A total of 350 tons were opened. The spot foreign rice was 7,000 bags, and the closing price was a little tighter for Siam rice than for Saigon rice.

The arrival of glutinous rice has not been consecutive, so the merchants' sentiments are quite firm. At the same time, the out-of-town customers, although the price plate has been raised again and again with other goods, the price is still very cheap. Moreover, at the time when rice prices are expensive, the general public already feels that it is beyond their ability to afford, so they are very welcome to it. Because the price is cheap and the quality is good, it is palatable and can satisfy hunger, so the sales market continues to expand. Not only do many Zhejiang Shaoxing gangs purchase it, but also the scattered rice loads in the local street stores are doing well. As a result, the market is very firm, and the selling price has increased by about 0.5 yuan. The opened price of the high quality Jinyin rice was 61 yuan and 60.5 yuan, the Chang Dan white rice was around 59 yuan, and the Jiangbei goods were 57 to 58 yuan.

The national rice such as thick and thin japonica rice arrived yesterday, counting 700 to 800 bags. It is rumored that there was off-market trading. Because of the previous severe turbulence, the price of each good was inevitably high, but the customers felt thorny, and there were limited transactions. Although the cargo owners still hoped to raise the price, they did not succeed, and only maintained the set price. The high quality Changbang short grain rice was still 75 yuan, the Su Kun Changzhou white japonica rice was from 73 to 74 yuan, and the inferior Su Re japonica rice was around 70 yuan. The Qingzhou special thin rice was 73 yuan, and the inferior was 71 yuan. The Nangang early rice was 70 yuan and 69 yuan. Everything was the same as before.

### The Flour Market is Tight, and Each Factory Restricts Sales to Customers

The flour market yesterday performed firmly and strongly. The price plate of the second-class flour factory was still 13.8 yuan. The Fuxin and Fufeng factories maintained a daily supply of 6,000 bags. Other cities and towns generally refuse to sell to customers who are not familiar with the factory. Sales to Nanyang are still considered to be continuous, and each factory has restricted supply due to the lack of raw materials and insufficient production. Yesterday, the customer market did not open, and the returned goods took the opportunity to raise prices, so there was a high plate of 16.4 to 16.5 yuan off-market. The asking prices for old brands and inland flour are also frequently high, but there is no formal market.

Wheat: Import licenses have not yet been issued, and the current production price is rising, and the situation is quite tight.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Falls

The sugar market trended downward yesterday due to the weakening of foreign exchange. According to the origin, the C.I.F. K.G. price of coarse white sugar was $5.115 USD. The association's drawn plate, spot 24 coarse white sugar was 70.4 yuan to 70 yuan at the depot and 70 yuan to 69.7 yuan at the external depot in the morning and 69.4 yuan in the afternoon, down 1 yuan. The transit price was 55.4 yuan to 55.3 yuan in the morning and 55 yuan in the afternoon. The July 2nd hitting bill of lading was 56.4 yuan. The Taikoo white B mark was 81 yuan, and the HX mark was 79.5 yuan, down 1 yuan. The H mark of the red car was still 58 yuan, and the Dutch red was 59.5 yuan, a decrease of 0.2 yuan. The factory's snow white was 70 yuan, down 1 yuan. The factory's ice sugar was unchanged. For the domestic sugar, a Guangdong bang opened up more than 200 bags of red Chongdong Xiang at 52.2 yuan and 52 yuan, 200 boxes of stripe green sugar at 46 yuan to 45 yuan and 5.5 yuan.

### North and South Goods: Golden Needles Rose Again

Golden needles are tight because the supply of new goods this year has become scarce. The first batch of new vegetables must be in the range of 60 yuan, so the old goods are also very tight. Yesterday, more than 30 bags of Da Xing vegetables were opened, and the price rose to 42 yuan in cash. It was found that the previous market had opened at 40 yuan in Chinese currency, up 5 to 6 yuan.

### Cotton Piece Goods Frequently Fall; Domestic Sales Still Booming

National Cloth: The market plummeted rapidly, dampening enthusiasm, and buyers hesitated. Sales were affected by the sharp drop in some cloth prices the previous day. Yesterday, the remaining lots also continued to fall by about one yuan per piece. Futures trading remained virtually suspended. Procurement from the Su-Wan and Hang-Jia-Hu guerrilla areas was quite active, with transactions in coarse cloth, colored cloth, bleached cloth, fine cloth, and foreign yarn exceeding 8,000 pieces. Ningbo merchants purchased over a hundred items of twill, coarse cloth, and colored cloth. Local dyeing factories purchased over a hundred pieces of grey cloth. It was reported that the Guangdong merchants planned to ship various cloths to Guangzhou Bay, first to Hong Kong, and then for re-export.

Eastern Cloth: The falling trend intensified, with new low prices repeatedly seen. The morning market's leading fine cloth fell from 28.8 yuan to 27.9 yuan, with the lowest price reaching 27.7 yuan in the later market. "Four Gentlemen" serge plummeted to 7.7 fen. However, due to the excessive consecutive declines, it attracted offsetting trades from industry peers and new buyers. Therefore, the leading fine cloth quickly rebounded to 28.25 yuan, and serge closed at 7.89 fen. The total daily transaction volume of fine cloth was six to seven hundred pieces, mostly purchased by Tianjin merchants.

Exports: 215 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Tianjin today, another 45 pieces to Yantai, and another 35 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Seafood: Domestically Produced Shrimp Tails Rise Again

Domestically produced shrimp tails have seen active sales recently, leading to a turnaround in market conditions. For example, Yantai Longxudao shrimp tails continued to be sold yesterday, with a transaction price of 330 yuan, a slight increase of two or three yuan compared to the previous level. Gaoyou Dazao red tails opened at 195 yuan, requiring more than ten yuan, and small Zao red tails were at 175 yuan, followed by 165 yuan, all of which were considered stable.

### Finance: Frequent Bearish News in Foreign Exchange Market

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed prices fluctuating up and down. In the after-hours market, the informal market for British and American currencies showed strong growth potential. The British exchange rate first stepped out of the four-shilling threshold, and the US exchange rate also loosened beyond six yuan. In the morning trading session, rumors suddenly emerged that the US dollar was devaluating, that US Senator Stimson would be appointed Secretary of War, and that conflicts had broken out between Germany and the Soviet Union. As a result, market sentiment was quite reactive, and speculators kept selling. Hong Kong Telecom was still the only major seller. At noon, the highest price for British gold reached 4 shillings 03125 pence. The market initially remained loose. The US exchange rate once reached 6.0625 yuan. Later, as HSBC suddenly agreed to absorb, there were more buyers, and the market image slightly turned around. However, the final report of a significant increase in the price of the US dollar made operators see it as bearish, and the market hardened again. As a result, British gold was 4 shillings 03125 pence, and the US exchange rate was 6 yuan, with the British currency falling by 0.09375 pence and the US currency rising by 0.21875 yuan compared to yesterday's closing.

After opening, American banks offered a special incentive, with the US dollar price appearing at 5.8125 yuan, immediately hardening the market. The silver equalization tax was announced to be reduced by 1.50/1000. After that, Hong Kong Telecom also came to sell, and Chinese speculators followed suit, making the informal market even looser. It was rumored that there was bearish news from Europe, and there was talk of another US dollar devaluation. Initially, Hong Kong Telecom sold US dollar for July delivery from 5.75 yuan to 78125 yuan, while speculators sold the same month US dollar to foreign firms from 5.75 yuan to 875 yuan. Until noon, there was still a lack of buyers, and positions were exceptionally abundant, so there was no turning back after hardening. Hong Kong Telecom once sold British gold to HSBC for 4 shillings this month, with the loosest price seen at 4 shillings 03125 pence. As a result, British gold was 4 shillings, and the US exchange rate was 6 yuan, with the morning opening showing British currency rising by 0.0625 and US currency sharply hardening by 0.21875. Futures were also loose.

US Dollar Once Reached Six Yuan

The current US exchange rate once retreated to 5.9375 yuan. Subsequently, the rumor of the US ambassador flying to Chongqing hardened the market again. As a result, British gold was 4 shillings 03125 pence, and the US exchange rate was 6 yuan. July delivery for central bank gold was 3 shillings 96875 pence, and US dollar was 5.875 yuan, with spot prices at close higher than the previous evening, with the British currency rising by 0.09375 and the US currency falling by 0.21875.

### Gold Market Suddenly Plunges Sharply, Lowest Seen at 5,320 Yuan

Yesterday's informal spot gold market continued to decline following the previous day's weak trend, as market sentiment was swayed by various bearish news, such as rumors that the United States was more actively assisting Britain, increasing the possibility of US involvement in the war, and various other bearish rumors, causing the local foreign exchange market to decline continuously, and gold prices followed suit. The morning opening was 5,630 yuan. Zhongjin Gold Exchange once tried hard to buy, reaching 5,650 yuan, but due to the intense selling by banks, it fell to a low of 5,410 yuan. However, the noon closing rebounded slightly to 5,460 yuan. After the market opened in the afternoon, it felt unsustainable again, dropping from 5,410 yuan to a bottom of 5,320 yuan. It was then rumored that a certain exchange was actively killing long positions. Subsequently, both gold shops and securities firms entered the market slightly, suddenly rebounding to 5,540 yuan. As a result, it ultimately closed at 5,485 yuan, a decrease of 195 yuan compared to the previous day's settlement, and after closing, the off-market trading was only at 5,440 yuan, with a rather weak potential. The total daily trading volume was around 5,000 taels. Silver jewelry also fell by a small 20 yuan. Customs gold and other types remained flat.

Spot Gold Plummets by 200 Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (10 yuan) initially saw weakened foreign exchange, and market sentiment remained scattered and weak. The market opened at 50 yuan lower, with gold shops selling 30 taels to gold exchanges for 5,630 yuan. Because a certain bank released long positions from the previous day, and retail investors also sold, although a certain exchange was buying heavily at that time, the position still felt abundant, and it dropped by 25 yuan, with gold shops selling 50 taels to gold exchanges for 5,575 yuan. After that, there were fewer sellers, relying on exchanges and a certain gold shop to rush in first, and it once rebounded to 5,650 yuan. Suddenly, rumors of various bearish news from Europe circulated in the market, and the exchange market became even stronger, causing the selling trend to resume. Banks sold heavily again and again, and jewelry shops also sold. Although the exchange was still continuously adding long positions, it was no match for the crowd, and it fell by 110 yuan, with banks selling 30 taels to gold exchanges for 5,540 yuan. At that time, gold shops bought in, rebounding by 30 yuan. However, at noon, the exchange market was particularly strong, and the selling trend was difficult to stop, and a certain exchange weakened in its buying appetite, plummeting by another 160 yuan, with banks trading 20 taels for 5,410 yuan. Before closing, gold shops and bank groups dragged in, rebounding by 50 yuan, with gold shops buying 20 taels from banks for 5,460 yuan, as the noon closing price. When the afternoon session opened, a certain exchange suddenly thought of selling, and the exchange market reported strength, lacking buyers. First, the exchange sold 30 taels to the gold shop for only 5,410 yuan. Later, retail investors dragged in, slightly rebounding by 20-30 yuan, but because the long positions of a certain exchange tended to sell, they were ultimately suppressed by about 100 yuan, with the exchange selling 50 taels to the gold shop for 5,320 yuan. Later, due to the softening of foreign exchange and talk of issuing gold treasury bonds, buyers were temporarily excited, and competed to buy, and at that time, a certain jewelry shop also strongly entered more than 200 taels, and securities firms also dragged in. Before long, it rebounded by 220 yuan, with securities firms buying 30 taels from gold shops for 5,540 yuan. After entering, rumors of bearish news suddenly circulated, and the exchange market hardened again. Gold shops and securities firms turned to selling, and it fell again by 55 yuan, with gold shops selling 30 taels to banks for 5,485, as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell by 195 yuan compared to the previous day's settlement, and after closing, the securities firms felt even weaker and sold out dozens of taels, only reporting 5,440 yuan. The total fluctuation was 330 yuan. The current price of cash gold sold by gold shops is more than a dozen yuan higher than that of spot gold, and the purchase price is reduced by 30 yuan. The current margin gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and both are rarely traded.

Jewelry is Only Listed at 560

The exchange price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops initially remained at 580 yuan in the major banks. At 9:50, it was reduced by a small 10 yuan. At 11:45, it was reduced by another 10 yuan. At 2:10 in the afternoon, it was reduced by another 10 yuan. At the same time, at 2:45, it rebounded by 10 yuan. At 3:15, it returned by another 10 yuan. At 3:30, it re-reduced by a small 10 yuan. As a result, it fell by a total of 20 yuan. It is estimated that the major banks changed the listing to 560 yuan, and the new banks have the same price as the previous one, and the purchase price is reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Plunge

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot gold trending downwards, and British and American gold pounds also gradually fell. British surplus notes were still abundantly supplied, and the market price was very soft. American gold notes were shrouded in a selling atmosphere all day, and once retreated to 16.15 yuan in the afternoon, eventually closing at 16.4 yuan, a sharp drop of 0.75 yuan compared to the previous day. The reason for the decline was that Stimson was about to be appointed Secretary of War, and the general public was deeply afraid that the US would join the war. Hong Kong notes continued to decline along with the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. Canadian and Philippine notes were also supplied, and market prices were consistently weak. The demand for Japanese gold notes was drastically reduced, and the market price was slightly soft, with the evening price at 1.08 yuan. Korean notes had balanced supply and demand, with the evening price at 9.55 yuan.

### Discounting Greatly Loosened, Plunging 13 Yuan Compared to the Previous Day

Yesterday's discounting rate for exchange-cleared bills suddenly fell sharply, with the discount rate per thousand yuan dropping from around 90 yuan to a discount rate of 72 yuan for purchase and 77 yuan for sale. Later, it rebounded to 80 yuan, with the discount rate at 75 yuan for purchase, a sharp drop of 13 yuan compared to the previous day. The interest rate for interbank lending by the Money Industry Association was listed at 2.6 fen in both the morning and afternoon sessions.

### Securities: The Quiet Bond Market Was Slightly More Active Yesterday

The informal securities market rebounded slightly again yesterday. Market sentiment was somewhat positive because although the situation in Annam was tense and the rumors about Haiphong had been proven inaccurate, there was also talk that Stimson would be appointed Secretary of War, as Stimson was always in favor of supporting China and suppressing Japan. However, market transactions became scarce. Datong has always been buying, and others such as Defu, Jiufeng, and No. 25 have also been buying, while Shengda, Lianhe, Yuxing, and Tongkang have all been cutting long positions, so the market price wanted to rise but stopped. The future is still mostly swirling. The date of interest payment on July 31 is gradually approaching, but market sentiment still feels uneasy. Yesterday's market prices all rebounded, by 0.51 to 0.15 yuan. The total transaction volume was only around 400,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below.

Stock trading: 50 shares of Bank of Communications stock were traded, with the price at 65 yuan.

The stock market activities of the Public Industry Association yesterday, although a portion was covering short positions, were extremely firm, and buying sentiment was extraordinarily strong. If no special events occur, the market is expected to be higher next Monday. Rubber stocks are still being ignored, but for certain types of stocks that have been abandoned for a long time, the buying appetite is not bad.

London, 20th (Thursday) dispatch: Today's listed market prices for stocks of Central Commercial and Far East companies showed that bank stocks continued to weaken. The stock of Macquarie Bank continued to fall by 2 shillings 6 pence to 7 pounds 5 shillings. The stock of HSBC continued to fall by 2 pounds, with the stock registered in England at 68 pounds and the stock registered in Hong Kong at 73 pounds. The rest were unchanged.

London, 20th (Thursday) dispatch: Today's listed market prices for Chinese foreign debts remained stable, and there were no changes in the various bonds in the upper and lower ranges.

### Yarn and Cotton: The Decline in Cotton Yarn Has Been Curtailed, Double Horse Revolving Within the Thousand Yuan Mark

Yesterday, the yarn market, which had fallen sharply the previous day, saw the weak trend subdued, and a slight stability was recorded. Nan Hai shipping line and the ships from Hong Kong to Haiphong could still sail, and the goods could still be transported, which boosted the morale again, but the Japanese warships clustered around Tokyo Bay especially made it impossible for buyers to be enthusiastic, so the market was still revolving within the 1000 Yuan mark.

The current yarn market opened with slightly better morale. Twenty counts of Double Horse rose by ten yuan, with the price at 980 yuan. As soon as the higher price of 1000 yuan was seen, sellers came in droves, and the market price suddenly fell again. At the same time, the foreign exchange also lengthened, and the surplus price was also small, and the market bearishness became even more weary, and it fell to 940 yuan. Then it was reported that the Guangdong merchants who had not completed a package on the previous day were procuring again yesterday, and the market situation then turned up in a moment, rising to 985 yuan, and the closing price returned to weak again. According to the transaction statistics for half a day, 2,555 bales were traded, and the market rose by 18 yuan. Today, 188 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 984 pieces to Tianjin, and 160 pieces to Yantai. The amount purchased by each gang is listed below.

### Cotton Has Become a Dead Market

The current cotton market situation is particularly stagnant, with no demand from any party, and is actually a result of the fact that the goods ordered by various firms are very sufficient. As for the factories, due to the sluggish yarn market, the procurement power is particularly weak. Although the people look at it favorably, it is difficult to develop in reality at present.

Another report on the price of foreign cotton: In the New York cotton market, yesterday morning, initially due to pressure from sellers, and then due to hedging sales in the South and the closing of some long positions, the closing price of the near-term fell by 18-19 points, and the long-term fell by 5-6 points. The Indian cotton market fell by five rupees along with the forecast yesterday.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading, the market is particularly quiet, and all parties are holding a wait-and-see attitude. At present, silver is extraordinarily tight, and yarn prices have fallen miserably. The cotton market has become a dead market due to the influence of all parties. According to the current situation, it is difficult to have a turnaround for a while.

### Food: Rice Prices Difficult to Lower; Glutinous Rice Sales Suddenly Booming

Yesterday, the surging tide of the rice market was stable, and all kinds of reports about Haiphong have been proven to be inaccurate, and shipping continues to pass, and the source of goods should be available. Speculators have lost their basis and it is difficult to create trouble. Only domestic rural villages are generally selling for actual needs for emergency purposes and are still booming. The market was flat and weak in the morning, with no changes. Until in the middle of the market, the prices of foreign rice of all colors returned to the highest peak of the day before yesterday. No. 1 Chen Saigon 66 yuan, No. 2 63.5 yuan, but since the overall situation has fluctuated once, it is difficult to rise again. They will only revolve back and forth, entering and exiting the left and right of this price, and when the market is about to close, the retail wholesale market turns sluggish, and more goods are released, and it falls back by half a yuan. Therefore, as a result, the closing price of No. 1 Chen Saigon was 65.5-65 yuan, No. 2 63 yuan, No. 1 Siam 65-64.5 yuan, Special 66-65.5 yuan, No. 2 63 yuan, the initial rise was followed by a decline, and after the decline, there was a rise, and there were several ups and downs, and as a result, compared with the previous evening, it was smaller by 50-1000 fen. However, because the new transaction has not been settled, the returned goods are not continuous, and the people still hope for a good market, and the hoarding is also absorbed, and the price is even higher. The opening price of Siam No. 2 rice shipped on the 18th was from 70.5 to 71 yuan, and the opening price of Siam rice shipped on the 26th was from 67-67.5 to 68 yuan, and the price of Saigon No. 2 was 66-67 yuan, and a total of 350 tons were opened. At present, 7,000 bags of foreign rice are being held. At the close, it was slightly tighter than Siam.

The arrival of glutinous rice has not been continuously seen, which makes the merchants rather firm. At the same time, for those who act as guests, although the price has been raised again and again, it is still particularly cheap compared to other goods, and the rice is expensive. The general public already feels unable to cope with it, and it is particularly welcome. Therefore, the sales are more and more popular because of the cheap price and good quality, and it is suitable for eating and resistant to hunger, not only in the inland Zhejiang Shaoxing area, but also in the local store that sells scattered rice. The market is so strong that the selling price continues to increase by 500 fen. The opening price of Jinli special Yuan was 60.5-60 yuan, Changdan Baiyuan was about 59 yuan, and Jiangbei goods were 57-8 yuan.

Yesterday, thick and thin Jing rice and other domestic rice arrived at the port, counting 700-800 bags. It is rumored that there are off-site informal transactions. After the previous fierce shock, all goods have been stunned, but the guests feel thorny and the transactions are limited, even though the merchants still hope to raise the price, it is only a fixed price. Changbang Special Qingjing is still 75 yuan, Sukun Changzhou Baijing, etc. from 73-4 yuan, and the next to Su Re 70 yuan, Qingzhou Special Thin 73 yuan, the next to 71 yuan, Nangang early rice 70-69 yuan, all similar to the previous one.

### Flour Market Tight, Factories Restrict Sales to Customers

Yesterday's flour market showed strong and tight performance, the price of No. 2 flour mill was still 13.8 yuan. Fuxin and Fufeng mills maintain daily supply and there are 6000 bags, and they generally refuse other places and local customers. The customer sales to Nanyang are still considered Lian Chan, and the mills have already restricted supply due to the lack of raw materials and the insufficient production. The customers did not open, and the returned goods took the opportunity to raise, so there was a high off-site offer of 16.4-5 yuan. The asking prices of old car brand and domestic flour are also frequent and high, but there is no formal market.

The transport permit of wheat has not been issued so far. The current production price is high, and the situation is also quite tight.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Returns to Decline

Yesterday, the sugar market returned to decline with the lengthening of foreign exchange. According to the production electricity, the rough white CIFKG is US$5.115, and the union’s planned price is 24 yuan. The rough white stock is 70.4 yuan, and the foreign stock is 70-69.7 yuan in the morning and 69.4 yuan in the afternoon, a drop of 1 yuan.

### North-South Goods: Golden Vegetables Rise Again

Because the short sign of the current new goods of the golden needle has become a reality, the first batch of new vegetables must be around 60 yuan, so the old goods are also very tight. Yesterday, more than 30 bags of Daxing dishes were opened, and the price rose to 42 yuan in cash. It was found that the previous market was opened with 40 yuan, an increase of 5 or 6 yuan.

### Cotton Piece Goods Frequently Fall; Domestic Sales Still Booming

National Cloth: The market plummeted rapidly, dampening enthusiasm, and buyers hesitated. Sales were affected by the sharp drop in some cloth prices the previous day.

The morning market's leading fine cloth fell from 28.8 yuan to 27.9 yuan, with the lowest price reaching 27.7 yuan in the later market. "Four Gentlemen" serge plummeted to 7.7 fen. However, due to the excessive consecutive declines, it attracted offsetting trades from industry peers and new buyers. Therefore, the leading fine cloth quickly rebounded to 28.25 yuan, and serge closed at 7.89 fen. The total daily transaction volume of fine cloth was six to seven hundred pieces, mostly purchased by Tianjin merchants.

Exports: 215 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Tianjin today, another 45 pieces to Yantai, and another 35 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Seafood: Domestically Produced Shrimp Tails Rise Again

Domestically produced shrimp tails have seen active sales recently, leading to a turnaround in market conditions. For example, Yantai Longxudao shrimp tails continued to be sold yesterday, with a transaction price of 330 yuan, a slight increase of two or three yuan compared to the previous level.

### Exhortations and Admonitions by Zeng Wenzhenggong: Simple Words

1.  Practice Diligence to Fulfill Your Duty: Observe the farmers and peasants in the fields, who are diligent throughout the year and have fewer illnesses. Then you will know that labor is the way to nourish the body. Observe Shun, Yu, and the Duke of Zhou, who were worried and laborious throughout their lives and enjoyed longevity. Then you will know that labor is the way to nourish the mind. In general, diligence makes things difficult to decay, while leisure makes things easy to break. This is true of everything. There are five ways to be diligent: First, be diligent in body. Go to dangerous and remote roads to verify them. Experience difficult and harsh environments for yourself. Second, be diligent in eye. When you meet someone, be sure to carefully observe them. When you receive a document, be sure to review it repeatedly. Third, be diligent in hand. Pick up items that are easy to discard. Record things that are easy to forget. Fourth, be diligent in mouth. Advise colleagues to advise each other, and instruct subordinates again and again. Fifth, be diligent. Sincerity can open even metal and stone; accumulated deep thinking can communicate with ghosts and gods. If all five are achieved, there is no duty that will not be fulfilled. Second, Advocate frugality to cultivate integrity. In the past, state and county assistants and miscellaneous officials had no salary or silver when they were on duty in the province, but now they are paid dozens of gold coins per month and still complain that it is too little. In the past, recommended tribute students sat in outside libraries, receiving no more than a few gold coins per month, but now they have increased to one or two times that amount and complain that it is too little. This is called not knowing contentment. If you want to learn integrity, you must first know contentment. Seeing the refugees everywhere and the starving people everywhere, our peaceful residence and food and clothing are already extremely fortunate. What extravagant hopes do we still have? How dare we be extravagant? Not only should we be honest in taking profits, but we should also be honest in taking fame. Do not be greedy for guarantees, do not like false praise, know contentment in everything, and everyone should abide by frugality, then the destiny can be reversed.

### Save the "Wild Children"

— Yao Jingxing

No matter what corner of society you look at, there are always many pitiful "wild children," wandering the streets, lonely and helpless. No one raises them, and no one cultivates them. This group of pure-hearted children is only being ravaged and tormented by the dark environment.

Everyone knows that children are the future masters of the country. Therefore, the quality of children is naturally related to the rise and fall of the entire country. Moreover, in times of national crisis, children's responsibilities are even more important. Just imagine: the country has encountered this unprecedented catastrophe, the fields are barren, the industry is withering, the construction has been destroyed, and everything is waiting to be rebuilt. Undoubtedly, these arduous tasks of restoration will fall on the shoulders of the younger generation.

The responsibility of children is indeed extremely great! However, few people pay attention to these "wild children" who are also children of the nation.

There are indeed schools that pride themselves on "cultivating students" and "creating talents," but aside from "cultivating" and "creating" a few students who can afford tuition, many "wild children" can only linger outside the school gates. We know that the desire for knowledge and academic pursuits is by no means the exclusive birthright of a few students who can afford tuition; similarly, "wild children" also have the idea of ​​seeking knowledge and progressing. However, they are not able to enjoy the right to study and seek knowledge. How many potentially talented people have been buried because of this, and at the same time, how many outstanding citizens has the country lost? That is truly an irreparable loss.

Some people despise "wild children," saying that "wild children" have become "wild" in nature and are difficult to change, therefore, they are unteachable. I think this is an unreasonable statement. For example, even a piece of waste can still be utilized, so can't a child with intelligence and without disability be cultivated into a healthy citizen? Take Maxim Gorky, a literary giant in the world, for example. Wasn't he also a wandering "wild child" in his childhood, who was a thief and a scavenger? That is a powerful counter-evidence.

Let's not underestimate "wild children." In fact, every "wild child" has talent. As long as we strictly cultivate and educate them, it is very easy to create a promising child - an excellent future master of the country.

Hurry up and save the "wild children"! Jingwei

Psychology

### Laughter is Good Medicine

Abraham Lincoln, who freed the slaves, served as both head of state and marshal during the five-year American Civil War, handling countless military affairs and daily affairs, but he used laughter to entertain himself, and was one of the best at joking and entertaining others. At any time and any place, regardless of class, he always used jokes as his main form of recreation. He believed that he was in charge of everything, "Whether official or private matters are piling up, thoughts are surging, and even external criticisms and public judgments are enough to stimulate my brain infinitely. Like a string being stretched, it is already very tight. If there is no way to relax it, then the wood for my grave will have already been arched. This is why I take pleasure in laughter at all times without getting tired of it." This shows Lincoln's excellent life art, no wonder his collection of jokes has won the praise of many people.

As a Western saying goes: "Laughter is the best soup at the table," which shows that laughter has great benefits. If we use a machine to compare people, then laughter is the oil of the machine. Worry is like a machine lacking oil and having to rotate forcefully. Over time, it will inevitably damage the body, but as long as you inject laughter oil, the whole body will become lively. Because laughter originates from the lungs and diaphragm, it allows the internal organs to have sufficient movement, blood circulation can be complete, breathing can be adjusted, the chest can be expanded, toxic gases generated internally can be expelled, and the activities of various parts of the body can be coordinated, ultimately leading to a healthy development of the body.

In fact, the effect of laughter on the psychological aspect is even greater than on the physiological aspect. It is like a candle flame, which can emit light itself and can also share light with other things without diminishing its own brightness. In other words, emotions are contagious, and laughter is even more contagious. Laughing for self-entertainment is certainly beneficial to oneself, and laughing to entertain others can also be said to be a life's duty.

Laughter is worthy of being called good medicine, and the reason why patients especially need to laugh is because laughter has psychological and spiritual effects. A certain American woman, suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, was limited by economic conditions and could not take the rest as prescribed by the doctor. She thought that "a cheerful mind can help speed up the healing of the disease," so she often sought pleasure for herself and told jokes. Over time, it became a habit, and one could often hear her chuckling. After a year or two, her illness was cured. There was also a clown in a certain mental hospital in the United States who specialized in making fun and joking in the hospital to entertain the inmates and purify their minds. Later, a big man was admitted to the hospital, who always had a sad face and did not show any smile. Even when others laughed, he was still sad and self-absorbed. One day, because everyone was laughing, he also accidentally joined in the laughter for more than fifteen minutes. He fainted, and when he woke up, his illness disappeared, and he was completely cured.

The laughter of ordinary people is superficial; some people with cultivation can laugh off the joys, sorrows, and angers of the world; if a person can't help but laugh alone, he already has good cultivation, because he can objectively observe himself.

### My Visit to the School for the Blind and Deaf

— Pan Li

I visited the school for the blind and deaf, which was built on a wide square, with a friend. The left wing of the building belongs to the blind, and the right wing belongs to the deaf-mute.

From outside the window, I saw several blind people inside singing hymns with their mouths wide open, and one of them was playing the piano, emitting a clear and desolate tone.

We entered the school gate and went to the library upstairs. The teacher called two students to demonstrate the characters embroidered by the blind. One first embroidered a sentence and asked the second to touch it and read it out. The students also used their hands to read foreign magazines to us.

In the corridor, there were several little blind children, seven or eight years old, boys and girls. Hearing the teacher's call, they quickened their pace and walked towards the direction from which the sound came, with curious smiles on their faces. They used their soft little hands to affectionately touch our clothes, touch our hair, and touch our faces, as if seeking the dumb riddles of another world, as if wanting to communicate with humans from another planet.

Under the gentle touch of their little hands, my cheeks shuddered. I felt that tears almost burst out of my eyes.

With a heavy heart, I went to see the deaf-mute struggling to speak in flat tones. I left the school for the blind and deaf with an even heavier heart.

The blind know the preciousness of eyes, and the deaf-mute know the importance of sound.

Hawthorne's Detective Story

### The Dancer's Fate

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Two "A Page of History!"

Li Zhifan suddenly raised his body slightly and answered humbly, "Of course. I will definitely tell you what I know truthfully. What do you want to ask, Mr. Hawthorne?" Hawthorne said in a seemingly irrelevant way, "As far as I know, Miss Wang is no longer a dancer. Is that right?"

"Yes, she has retired from the dance hall since last autumn."

"Looking at this kind of scene, the monthly living expenses seem to be quite high."

Li Zhifan nodded busily and replied, "Very high! Maybe it costs a thousand dollars a month! Mr. Hawthorne, it's not that I'm narrow-minded, but from the perspective of us country folks, it really feels like a waste. I've told Lilan a few times, but what's the use!"

Hawthorne nodded and said, "That's right. Then, do you know where she gets this kind of expense from?"

This question stumped the deceased's uncle. He lowered his eyes and seemed a little embarrassed. It wasn't that he couldn't answer, but he just couldn't say it. After a pause, he finally reluctantly answered.

"I'm not very clear about this. On the one hand, her income was very high when she was a dancer, so maybe she has some savings. On the other hand—this—this—"

"On the other hand, what?"

"There is a man named Lu who seems to provide her with a certain amount every month as well."

"Is that Lu Jiansheng, the manager of China-America Bank?"

"Exactly, he seems to have some other positions and has quite a bit of money."

"What kind of relationship does this Lu Jiansheng have with your niece?"

A layer of shame appeared on the old man's face again. He still seemed to be a typical old-fashioned scholar, at least he still knew shame. Because Hawthorne's question was indeed a bit difficult to answer for relatives with old-fashioned minds. He hesitated for a while before speaking hesitantly. (Twenty-two)

Essay

### Mountain Climbing

— Liao Ling

Since I was little, I have had a great fondness for towering mountains.

In my hometown, in every beautiful dusk, I excitedly climbed through the narrow and rugged mountain paths with scattered pines and cypresses. Sliding sand caused me to fall into mountain pits, pebbles scratched my feet, thorns pierced my legs and made them bleed, the distance made my body tired, sweat poured out, and I breathed heavily. But this did not diminish my interest and courage, and I did not turn back due to fatigue. I still worked hard and excitedly climbed up, all the way to the high mountain peak, resting on the rugged rocks, looking out over a peaceful field, the ancient city wall like a belt, looking up at the clear and boundless blue sky, listening quietly to the roar of the rushing waterfall and the whispers of the breeze in the pines and cypresses, forgetting the hard work and fatigue...

I have been away from those beloved, majestic mountains for a long time, but I have an even stronger interest, climbing another more thorny and rugged mountain path with many young people, using our greater courage and spirit of struggle, and reaching the great victorious mountain peak, watching our lovely and free motherland in the sunset glow, striving to build itself up!

Young people, work hard and climb up!
