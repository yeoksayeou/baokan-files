### Germany and Italy Accept Armistice, Presenting Moderate Terms to France, France Sends Plenipotentiary Representatives to Prepare for Negotiations, Content Too Harsh, Unacceptable to France

London: French radio claims that the French cabinet met at 9:00 AM to discuss Germany's reply to France's request for an armistice. At 11:30 AM, French radio announced that the French cabinet had appointed plenipotentiary representatives for armistice negotiations. However, the French army is continuing its resistance.

According to a statement issued after the meeting, the cabinet convened at 9:00 AM under the chairmanship of President Lebrun to consider the German government's note transmitted by the Spanish ambassador. The German government stated in the note that it was prepared to notify the French government of the conditions for ceasing hostilities after the names of the French plenipotentiary representatives were submitted. The German government will announce the date and location for receiving these plenipotentiary representatives. The cabinet has already appointed the plenipotentiary representatives. (Reuters, 19th)

New York: According to reliable sources from a Madrid correspondent of the "New York Times," the Axis powers' terms for peace were delivered to the Spanish Ambassador to France, Lequerica, last night. The ambassador is currently with the French government in Bordeaux. It is said that the terms are very harsh. The correspondent learned that the surrender of the French fleet is one of them. The correspondent also stated that, according to Madrid sources, almost all of the French naval forces sailed away from French ports yesterday. Spanish newspapers also vaguely mentioned seeing French planes flying towards Africa, presumably to avoid falling into the hands of the German army. (Reuters, 19th)

Munich: German Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini concluded a historic meeting here last night. Also present were German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Commander-in-Chief of the Wehrmacht Keitel, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, Chief of Staff Roatta, and Schmidt, a well-known interpreter from the German Foreign Office, serving as translator. After the meeting, a public statement was issued, saying, "The German Führer and the Italian Prime Minister have agreed on the attitude of both countries towards France's request for an armistice." The meeting lasted for 8 hours and 10 minutes and ended at 8:10 PM last night. Crowds waited outside the meeting hall for the end of the meeting. When Mussolini and Hitler left the Charles Palace, the crowds sang and cheered. Hitler accompanied Mussolini to the station. After Mussolini's special train left the station, Hitler also left Munich for another destination. Both destinations have yet to be announced. (United Press, 19th)

Munich: While Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini were talking in the study of Hitler's residence, their entourage also held discussions in another reception room. Attendees included Buti, Director of the Mediterranean Department of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Vitetti, Director of the Central European Department; Chief of Staff Roatta; Admiral Guagnot of the Navy; General Pellino of the Air Force; and Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the Wehrmacht; Bodenschatz, Director-General of the Air Ministry; Dietrich, Head of the Intelligence Department; Gaus, Director of the Legal Department of the Foreign Office; and Doehnberg, Director of the Protocol Department. Also present were the German Ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, and the Italian Ambassador to Germany, Alfieri. The content was said to be extremely confidential. (Haitong Press, 19th)

Italian Newspaper Reveals Content of Terms

Rome: According to the Italian newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia," the terms of peace presented by Germany and Italy to France regarding economic and industrial reparations are very harsh. The newspaper's special correspondent in Munich learned the results of the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini. It is said that these peace terms include territorial compensation and the following: (1) Transfer of France's gold and foreign deposits to the Axis powers; (2) Transfer of all gold and deposits held in France by countries at war with Germany, such as England, Poland, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium, to the Axis powers; (3) Delivery of all military infrastructure materials, gasoline, copper, and manganese in France to the Axis powers; (4) France should guarantee the restoration of peacetime industrial conditions and order the return of evacuated workers to their original industrial centers; (5) Guarantee that all French industrial, economic, commercial, and financial facilities should be used to blockade England. According to Berlin sources, German authorities have neither confirmed nor denied the news reported by the Italian newspaper, but believe that the Italian newspaper should not have published these peace terms. (United Press, 19th)

Berlin: The entire German people are focused on the Munich meeting. The opinions of political figures can be represented by the "Stürmer," which stated: "Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini are both striving to maintain peace, which is a common belief of the German and Italian people. Currently, the leaders of Germany and Italy are laying a permanent foundation for European peace. France now wants to avoid sacrificing more lives and shedding more blood and should not resist the inevitable. But more blood must be shed now, and the various disputes created by the financial oligarchy in Europe must be resolved. Therefore, what Germany cares most about is the permanent peace of Europe. We have not forgotten the experience we gained in November 1918, and the shackles imposed on us by the Treaty of Versailles. As for the terms of this armistice, France should accept the conditions we have proposed." (Haitong News Agency, 19th)

Germany Unwilling to Ceasefire Before Terms are Agreed Upon

Bordeaux: A French semi-official news agency pointed out that the communiqué released by Germany today did not contain the terms of the French armistice. It also said that hostilities could only end after these terms were agreed upon. These terms will now be returned to the French plenipotentiary representatives and may take days to agree upon before the ceasefire is implemented. It is feared that before the "ceasefire" is implemented, a larger part of French territory will be occupied by the German army. The German army is now vigorously advancing towards the southeast, which indicates that the German army intends to contact the Italian army before both sides implement a ceasefire. It is also heard that France has not yet received a reply to the official document sent to the Italian government through the Spanish ambassador. (Reuters, 19th)

French Generals in England Advocate Resistance to the End

London: French General de Gaulle, who served as Undersecretary of National Defense in the Reynaud cabinet, delivered a broadcast speech here on behalf of the French generals currently in England, advocating continued resistance. He stated, "The enemy's mechanical strength in both land and air is indeed superior to ours. It has been so in the past, and it is still so now. One of the reasons for our army's retreat is the larger number of German troops. However, their superior tanks, aircraft, and strategies are the main reasons. However, can this situation necessarily become a fixed and unchangeable state? Has all hope truly vanished and ceased to exist? Is our army so defeated that it cannot recover? All these questions can be answered with 'No.' I make this judgment based on what I know. Please do not doubt it. I dare to announce to the world that France has not given up hope. The manner in which it is currently experiencing setbacks has great potential to lead to victory in the future. Truly, France is not isolated. It has a vast colonial empire behind it, and it can unite with the British Empire, which controls the oceans and continues to fight. It can also fully utilize the vast resources of American industry. This war cannot be limited to the unfortunate territory of our country. How it ends is not determined by the outcome of the 'Battle of France.' In short, this war is a world war. Although we have made repeated mistakes and suffered deeply, there are various ways in the universe that can enable us to defeat the enemy one day. At this moment, although we are dispersed by mechanical forces, in the future we can still use even more powerful mechanical forces to conquer everything. It must be known that how the fate of the entire world evolves depends on this one move. Therefore, I dare to urge French officers, soldiers, technicians, and skilled workers who are currently in England or are about to come to England to return to me. No matter what changes happen in the future, the flame of French resistance must not be allowed to be extinguished and will never be extinguished." (Havas, 18th)

Before the French Armistice Agreement is Signed, the French Army is Ordered to Continue Fighting

Bordeaux: Premier Pétain and General Weygand, Chief of National Defense, jointly issued a public statement stating, "The government has received reports that the German army is currently misusing the white flag, attempting to gain a great advance without fighting. Therefore, it is solemnly notified to the land, sea, and air forces of our country and the allied countries that since the armistice agreement has not been concluded and hostile actions have not ceased, although we intend to conduct peace talks, in reality they have not yet begun. Therefore, our duty remains to continue fighting." (Havas, 18th)

German Mechanized Units Advance on Three Routes, Eastern Route Approaches Italian-Swiss Border

Berlin: The German High Command announced that while Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini were discussing France's surrender in Munich, German mechanized units continued to pursue the French army retreating towards the Atlantic yesterday. Currently, the German army's operations are divided into three routes of rapid advance: (1) Advancing from Normandy towards Brittany in the west; (2) Advancing southeast along the Loire River, with the apparent aim of joining the Italian army in Savoy; (3) Attempting to break through the Maginot Line and various fortresses in eastern France. (United Press, 19th)

Bordeaux: A Havas correspondent recently telegraphed from the front lines that the French army is divided into four isolated groups, with large gaps between their positions. They are currently continuing to resist, although the soldiers are extremely tired and the situation is quite critical, but they are still fighting bravely. The positions of each group from west to east are as follows: (1) The army downstream of the Seine River, which was originally fighting south of Évreux, has now been deployed to the Avranches heights. The enemy forces in that area are attacking the city of Anjou to the south on the right flank. (2) Along the Loire River, our army is fighting in Brouage, Orléans, and La Charité. The enemy has suffered heavy losses but is still attempting to cross the Loire River. To the east, enemy units have crossed the gap and divided into two routes, with the western route heading towards Nevers and the eastern route heading towards Dijon, Chalon, and the Swiss border. No reports have been received regarding the progress of enemy forces in that area. (3) The easternmost units of our army are very complete and are currently engaged in maneuvers, but the details are being kept secret. (4) Our army in the foothills of the Alps is threatened by enemy forces in the Saône River basin and has taken the necessary steps to defend itself properly. (Havas, 19th)

Bordeaux: The French General Headquarters recently released a battle report stating, "After the enemy launched a fierce attack on Normandy and Brittany today, they have made progress, but both sides are still engaged in fierce fighting south of Château-Thierry. In addition, the enemy has established multiple bridgeheads in the middle reaches of the Loire River, between Orléans and Nevers. Those between the Loire River and the Vosges Mountains are continuing to advance towards the Jura Mountains (i.e., the Maginot Line area). However, the French army in the provinces of Ain and Jura is still fighting hard against the enemy, preventing them from succeeding." (Havas, 18th)

### German Military Report

Hitler's Headquarters: This afternoon, the German military report stated that German troops occupied Cherbourg and La Haye-du-Puits, advancing rapidly towards Lyon. West of Mülhausen, tank and mechanized units from Gelford will connect with German troops who have crossed the upper reaches of the Rhine River. Further north, German troops occupied Nancy. On the Maginot Line, enemy troops continued to resist on both sides of Diedenhofen. German fighter planes and dive bombers are still cooperating with infantry to destroy the obstinate French troops trapped in Lorraine, bombing their fortresses and troop strongholds. Not far from Cherbourg, a merchant ship (10,000 tons) was sunk by bombs. German planes flew to England again, bombing airfields and oil depots, with the oil catching fire and burning. Last night, British planes bombed northern and western Germany, killing eighteen people. Yesterday, enemy planes lost a total of six aircraft, and five German planes were missing. (Haitong Press, 19th)

### German Planes Launch Large-Scale Attacks on England, Ten Eastern Counties Bombed, Most Intense Since Beginning of War, British Statement Claims Seven German Planes Shot Down

London: A joint statement from the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security stated that enemy planes attacked various districts in eastern England last night, dropping bombs. Air raid alerts were issued immediately. Four hours later, seven enemy planes were shot down. Bombs were dropped in various districts of eastern Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, killing eleven civilians and injuring fourteen. At least four children, including two infants, were among the civilians who lost their lives today. Most of the civilians injured or killed were in a row of houses that were hit. However, military targets did not suffer significant damage. Two German planes caught fire and crashed after being intercepted by British fighter planes off the east coast. Another German plane was shot down off the coast of Norfolk. Subsequently, another German plane was shot down in Kent. An air raid alert was issued on the coast of Yorkshire at midnight. One hour later, five groups of aircraft were sighted, believed to be enemy bombers flying from the east. An air raid alert was also issued at the mouth of the Thames River, lasting for one and a half hours. A town in the area was hit, injuring five people and killing two, including an old woman who died of heart failure. (Reuters, 19th)

London: Only a few hours after the British Prime Minister warned the British people that German planes would launch a large-scale air raid on England, the Nazi iron birds, as powerful as rushing waves, flew over the east coast of England last night and this morning and reached the British skies. Ten counties were bombed. According to official sources, the casualties were heaviest in the coastal ports of the east. The bombs dropped by the German planes all landed in densely populated areas and areas with many houses. It is said that the material damage was still minor, as the most significant damage was to private residences and farmhouses. According to explanations from military officials, the number of bombs dropped in this German air raid was not very large, and it is feared that it was still for reconnaissance purposes. The air raid began after 11:00 PM last night. Air raid alerts were issued in Kent, Essex, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Yorkshire, and Rutland. Residents of each county rushed to take refuge upon hearing the alert. This air raid alert was the longest since the beginning of the war, lasting for three and a half hours. A bomb fell in the garden of a town in East Dulwich. The glass windows and roofs of the houses in the garden were destroyed. Two people were killed and five injured in a town near East Dulwich. Among the seven or eight German planes shot down, there was a large bomber. It was reported that the plane was destroyed by Spitfires and crashed on the southeast coast. The aviators in the plane attempted to escape but failed, and all died. Observers believe that the Nazis bombed only thirty-six hours before the House of Commons was scheduled to hold a secret meeting to listen to Prime Minister Churchill and War Secretary Eden report on preparations to cope with the expected air raid, which has great significance. British military officials, while speculating on when Hitler would openly launch his blitzkrieg tactics against England, said that Britain might get a short rest when Germany finishes the war in France and reorganizes its troops to prepare for a new attack. The "Evening Standard" also believes that there may be a month of respite before Germany confronts England with all its strength. (United Press, 19th)

### French侨 (Overseas Chinese) in Hong Kong Oppose Surrender

Hong Kong: The stationed French consul telegraphed that French residing in Hong Kong all hope to continue the war and would rather lose the capital than surrender. This failure was due to an underestimation of Germany's strength. (18th)

Editorial

### An Awaited Question

Every minute, every minute, we await better or worse news; hoping to discern clues as to how the future will be decided and evolve; hoping to cope with the frustration that has been woven together by multiple parties in recent tens of hours. But we are still in the midst of waiting. The Munich telegram only stated that the German Führer and the Italian Prime Minister had agreed on the attitude of the two governments towards France's request for an armistice, and did not mention the content of the attitude. Such a brief and unclear message is certainly not enough to satisfy the world's expectations.

There is no page in history like this, where the depth and universality of human frustration can be compared to the present. The sky is dark, the shadows are flickering, and the sounds are murmuring. The next scene, which is inextricably linked to the pain of all mankind, is about to be revealed, but no one can predict what the next scene will be. What is vaguely audible is: First, the French authorities stated that what they are seeking is not a humiliating surrender, but an honorable cessation of hostilities; but how to be considered honorable is, of course, temporarily impossible to interpret. In addition, French General de Gaulle in London, England, called on the French military and civilians to go and join him; under this call, of course, everyone pays attention to the naval and air generals who still retain the greatest freedom of action. Second, the British authorities declared their continued fighting and everything is very active: especially its active nature is seen in the British Canadian Prime Minister's report that the Canadian Expeditionary Force landed and fortified in Danish Iceland, and is also managing the French territories in the Western Hemisphere. But in every sense, the diagnosis of the British attitude must wait until the German-French armistice agreement is established before it can be considered accurate. Third, the German government and the public are avoiding revealing any opinions on this change, so it is unfathomable; but the "Stürmer" argues that the common aspirations of the leaders of Germany and Italy and the common beliefs of the people are to strive to maintain peace and lay a permanent foundation for European peace; thus, the German state-run Haitong News Agency pointed out that this can represent the views of German political figures. Fourth, liquidation, revenge, severity, such calls are prevalent in Berlin, the German capital, and Rome, the Italian capital; it seems that the Roman side is particularly high. Fifth, US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark suddenly recommended to Congress to build 200 more warships, costing 4 billion US dollars; after completion, the quantity will be greater than the sum of the British and Japanese navies. Sixth, maritime transport between Hong Kong and the French coastal defense has been announced to be suspended: according to private speculation, it is not that the Chinese South China Sea has already been affected by the aftershocks of the European War, but because the British Eastern Fleet is committed to strengthening the defenses of Hong Kong and Singapore, and has no time to escort convoys, so as not to disperse its forces.

From these extremely vague clues, although they are definitely not comparable to castles in the air, nor are they mere rumors, yet based on these alone, it is absolutely not enough to glimpse how the future of the world will tend. The changes in the world are confusing, and the future is vague; except for bold and irresponsible prophets, there is really no way to talk about it at present. Even at present, to provide clues, the first is to quietly observe what questions Mr. Hitler and Mr. Mussolini will ask to France, or at different times to Britain and France. If we see the questions, we may be able to see a little bit of the trend from the side. Second, we must carefully examine what the contents are of the examination papers that are handed in by France or Britain and France. After seeing the contents, we may be able to infer a few percentages of success or failure from the side. Without seeing the questions, we can only be frustrated! In the midst of frustration, we can't help but fantasize: Is the establishment of a permanent foundation for European peace in the minds of German political figures necessarily the same as the interpretations added to Nazi and Fascist classics by British, American, and French propagandists and political commentators in recent years? Is it possible that such interpretations are completely malicious distortions? Could it be that the true meaning of the permanent foundation of peace in the minds of German political figures is indeed outstanding and surpasses the theory of the Treaty of Versailles, and is actually no different from the Confucian concept of the Kingly Way? Could it be that the conditions presented by Germany and Italy to Britain and France have abandoned the attitude of liquidation, rejected the idea of revenge, and do not take severity but still value forgiveness; making honest people in Britain and France smile through their tears? Making world public opinion unanimous? How can this not all be fantasy? But since a permanent foundation of peace is sought by both the government and the public in Germany and Italy, then mankind should have room to establish normal and common theories, and mankind should not despair of light. If victory or defeat is the standard for everything, if building warships is an unavoidable method, then it will inevitably be denied by common sense as the foundation for a permanent foundation of peace. If a permanent foundation of peace cannot be laid, then even if this war ends in victory, it is only preparing for the start of the next war.

### Central Memorial Week: Full Text of President Chiang's Speech: Evolution of European Situation Benefits China's War of Resistance; Remaining Japanese Troops in Xiangxi Can Be Eliminated; Encouraging the People to Fulfill the Mission of the Times

Chongqing: The main points of Chairman Chiang's speech at the Central Memorial Week on the seventeenth have been reported in a previous telegram. The full text has now been compiled and is hereby published.

A. Summary: (1) Explaining that the evolution of the European war is beneficial to our war of resistance; (2) Based on the recent war situation in northern and western Hubei, pointing out the clumsiness of the Japanese army's strategies and tactics, which will eventually be eliminated by our magnetic tactics; (3) Reporting the heroic achievements of our air force in smashing the Japanese dream of fiercely bombing Chongqing, and encouraging everyone to emulate the spirit of the air force soldiers, who achieve more with less; (4) Air raids are a good opportunity to temper our revolutionary spirit and realize our Three Principles of the People; all levels of supervisors must lead by example, work hard, improve work efficiency, and increase the strength of the war of resistance; (5) All cadres and agencies must strictly implement the Chairman's various orders to reduce air raid losses and the suffering of the people; (6) Testing whether our country has the integrity to fight against the enemy with one heart and whether our nation has the spirit of independent revival; (7) China's great contribution to the world in the war of resistance and the final victory are now in sight. I hope that everyone will actively strengthen themselves, work hard, and strive to complete the mission of our times.

B. Speech: Chairman, comrades, taking advantage of the opportunity of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Memorial Week today, I would like to report to you on the recent international situation and the Sino-Japanese war. On the international front, Paris was occupied by the German army last week. Since the start of the European war last September until last week when the French army withdrew from Paris, one can say that this is how the European war is developing. Although it is not possible to make a definitive judgment now, one thing can be affirmed: no matter how the European war changes, it is constantly evolving in a direction that is beneficial to our Chinese war of resistance. Especially in recent weeks, the tension in the European war has allowed the U.S. military expansion plan to be passed in its Congress. At the same time, the embargo issue has also begun to be implemented. These two things, whether directly or indirectly, have a greater impact on our Chinese war of resistance. I explained this principle in detail at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang last year. Looking back now, our past arduous struggle, in less than a year and a half, this ideal has been fully realized. From this, we can be more confident that the goal of our war of resistance, as long as we can follow our consistent war of resistance strategy and tactics, and advance step by step, we will surely achieve final victory. Therefore, the passage of the U.S. military expansion and embargo bills can be said to have already determined the future of East Asia and the final victory of our war of resistance. This explains the relationship between the European war and China's war of resistance. As for how the European war will develop in the future, I dare not say now. But no matter how the European war situation evolves, it will only benefit China's war of resistance and will not harm it. This can be said with certainty. Secondly, I want to talk about the recent situation of the Sino-Japanese war. From the first of last month to the fifteenth of this month, the Japanese's only goal was to imitate the German blitzkrieg style, wanting to resolve the Sino-Japanese war with extremely rapid means. At that time, we saw Japanese newspapers, almost the entire country unanimously demanded a quick way to end the Sino-Japanese war in order to liberate him from the shackles of pain. And the general public in our country inevitably thought that the Japanese might seek a solution politically or economically. But I have long affirmed that, now, the Japanese, other than trying to make a last-ditch effort in military affairs, cannot have other ideas. Therefore, for the past two months, the Japanese have been trying their best to attack militarily, wanting to end the Sino-Japanese war with a military victory. Especially since Germany used blitzkrieg tactics to attack the Netherlands and Belgium, the Japanese were particularly restless, thinking that Germany could use blitzkrieg to win completely in the Netherlands and Belgium, and why couldn't they use blitzkrieg to seek victory in China? So he also copied the old trick of Germany attacking the Netherlands and Belgium, wanting to defeat our Chinese army. Therefore, since the Japanese launched this offensive, I saw early on that the Japanese would definitely transfer troops from other battlefields, using all their strength to try to win. Sure enough, since the first of last month, the Japanese have concentrated a large number of air force and tanks in the Xianghua Road area, with the intention of first defeating our troops in northern Hubei. If our field strength were eliminated, the war in the Fifth War Area could be resolved first. We discovered this Japanese plot, so we automatically moved the field troops in that area to other areas. At that time, the Japanese army advanced to the Suizao area but could not find the location of our main field army. Until they advanced to the vicinity of Tanghe and Xinye, they still gained nothing. And our field troops suddenly advanced to the side and rear of the Japanese army at this time, cutting off the only rear transportation line, Lihua Road, and fiercely attacking the Japanese army from the side, forcing them to retreat south in a panic. At the same time, General Commander Zhang Zizhong's troops in eastern Xianghe were deploying positions on the south side of the Japanese army, preparing to deal a head-on blow. Under this situation, the Japanese could not but fight like cornered beasts, so they concentrated their planes and tanks and rushed south. General Zhang ordered his troops, with their disparate numbers, to naturally suffer considerable setbacks. The Japanese, on the one hand, saw that General Zhang's troops had suffered setbacks, and on the other hand, the attack on northern Hubei had backfired. Our General Headquarters had long anticipated that they would definitely take advantage of the reduction in our forces in western Xiangxi and take a chance. As for us, a part of the forces defending the Yangtze River and the Yellow River had been increased, so the remaining troops should not be stationed on the shore. Therefore, we first withdrew the main forces defending the Yangtze River and the Yellow River to the mountainous areas north of Yichang, waiting for an opportunity to attack. Later, the Japanese army did not disappoint us and attacked Yichang from the first of this month to the day before yesterday. Our troops in Yichang only had a small force, luring him into Yichang, while our main force automatically withdrew to the mountains around Yichang at that time. Now, although our Yichang streets have been abandoned, what is the real situation in Yichang? Today I can tell you, everyone, that our troops are still around Yichang, as close as 500 meters and as far as three or four kilometers. Therefore, our troops are still guarding the positions in the suburbs of Yichang. In fact, Yichang is still controlled by our troops, and our main force is actively adopting an encirclement around the Japanese army. I believe that this time, we will definitely be able to completely annihilate the Japanese troops in Xiangxi. The Japanese army is still unaware of this situation and instead exaggerates its propaganda as much as possible, claiming that its blitzkrieg tactics have been successful, and that its army is stronger than the German army and advancing faster than the German army, as if no country in the world can be its enemy. But they do not know that the clumsiness of their strategies and tactics is really not worth a knowledgeable person's smile. Everyone knows that the so-called blitzkrieg not only requires various well-equipped tanks and elite air force, but also various scientific organizations and technologies, and also requires good traffic roads in the combat zone. Only when the right time, place, and people cooperate with each other can results be achieved. But where do the Japanese have such conditions for combat now? He compares himself to Germany, which is even more of a (Dong Shi imitates Xi Shi)'s act. With Japan's industry and weapons and equipment, he wants to compare himself to Germany, and wants to imitate Germany's blitzkrieg tactics to advance deeply in order to end the war of aggression against China. How can he not be trapped by his own actions and be killed? What's more, how can the terrain and transportation in western Hubei and this battlefield carry out blitzkrieg? Therefore, the Japanese's so-called blitzkrieg is really no different from a fool's dream. However, on the other hand, we have a very effective tactic to attract, trap, and suffocate the Japanese for this kind of stupid political offense. No matter how he acts, we can control his life, especially when he goes deep and rushes forward, so that he meets our tactical conditions. I can tell you clearly and publicly now that our only tactic for fighting the Japanese is the magnetic tactic, which is like a magnet attracting iron, making him closer and closer, tighter and tighter, unable to retreat, unable to advance, and unable to escape our control. Finally, he falls into a desperate situation where he cannot advance or retreat. Therefore, the Japanese army is now not only unable to use blitzkrieg, but even if the Japanese can meet the conditions for combat and implement his blitzkrieg, it will eventually be overcome by our (magnetic tactic). We are now not worried that Yichang cannot be recovered, but that the Japanese army is unwilling to fight in Xiangxi. If so, our (magnetic tactic)'s annihilation strategy will be fully realized in the shortest period of time. In short, we use our true magnetic tactics to deal with the Japanese blitzkrieg tactics, and we use the national spirit of our military and civilians being willing to be jade fragments rather than broken tiles to deal with the Japanese army's exhausted, boring, and blindly bombing policies. We will not only make all the forces used by the Japanese army into a pillar to play the zither, but also make him hit the wall everywhere, be empty all the time, and be no different from lifting a spear to attack the air. Our predetermined political and military strategy cannot fail to achieve final success. The above is an explanation of the Sino-Japanese war situation in the past two months and our use of magnetic tactics to attack the Japanese army, so that they cannot escape our control.

### U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Proposes Building 200 New Warships: Unprecedented Expansion Program Submitted to Congress: Organizing Two Ocean Fleets to Defend the Western Hemisphere

Washington: U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark requested Congress yesterday to increase the naval strength by 70%, effectively doubling the current fleet strength. The required funding is US$4,000,000,000. Admiral Stark declared that the increase would make the U.S. Navy the largest in the world, larger than the combined British and Japanese fleets. Given the current world situation and the need to defend the Western Hemisphere and the Monroe Doctrine, it is necessary to organize a great fleet. When Admiral Stark proposed increasing naval strength by 70%, the House Naval Affairs Committee was considering increasing naval tonnage by 23%. Admiral Stark's proposal includes the Vinson Act, which provides for the addition of 84 new warships. President Roosevelt signed a bill on Monday to increase naval tonnage by 11%. The President supports the Vinson Act, which increases naval strength by 23%. (On Monday, the House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill to increase the U.S. Army's strength to 400,000 men. This increase is three times the number of U.S. Army personnel in 1939, making the U.S. Army the largest since 1919. (Nineteenth United Press dispatch)

Washington: U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark recently suddenly submitted an expansion program for the U.S. Navy to Congress, the scale of which is unprecedented in the world.

Washington: The U.S. House Naval Affairs Committee yesterday unanimously passed U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark's proposal to increase the strength of the U.S. fleet by 70% by a vote of 17 to 0. This proposal would give the U.S. Navy 738 warships, plus 200 new warships. The construction of the new ships will take five to seven years. After the new ships are completed, the United States will have two ocean fleets. Recently, the U.S. Army newly formed two streamlined infantry divisions to strengthen the Atlantic and Pacific coastal defenses. The new divisions are designated as the 7th Division and the 8th Division. The 7th Division will be stationed in California, and the 8th Division will be stationed at Camp Jackson in South Carolina.

### U.S. to Require All Young People to Serve: But Not Strict Military Service

Washington: President Roosevelt stated that the United States will undoubtedly require every young person to serve the government in some capacity, but not strict military service. The new service requires all young people, regardless of their class, to serve. The President said that he once praised a newspaper editorial that advocated universal military training. He spoke rashly at the time. The military training he had in mind was actually military training in a broad sense, that is, training those who fight behind the front lines. The so-called behind the front lines refers to factories, munitions plants, and maintaining necessary resources. (Nineteenth Reuters dispatch)

### U.S. Ships Continue to Stay in Hawaiian Islands: Repeatedly Postponing Visits to Pacific Coast Ports

Hong Kong: According to Honolulu telecommunications, U.S. Fleet Commander Admiral Richardson announced on the evening of the seventeenth that the U.S. Fleet would continue to stay in Hawaii indefinitely. The U.S. Fleet was originally scheduled to visit various ports along the Pacific coast in early July, but it has now been decided to postpone it again. This is the second postponement. The first postponement was because the Navy Department wanted the U.S. Fleet to continue training. Admiral Richardson did not explain the reason for the second postponement. (Nineteenth dispatch)

He also said that compulsory service will only apply to those who serve in Canada. Recruits who go overseas will still be recruited voluntarily. King continued that Canadian troops have been sent to the West Indies to replace the British garrison in the area, and that Newfoundland is now also stationed with Canadian troops. Conscription measures will give the government the power to use the resources and wealth necessary for the war, and there is no doubt that Canada will do its utmost to the limit of its resources. When King announced that Britain's decision to continue fighting was also Canada's decision, the entire House applauded.

### Chaotic Situation in Japanese Concessions; Further Designs on Vietnam; France and Japan Obstruct the Transportation of Munitions Through Vietnam; Indefinite Suspension of Ship Traffic Between Hong Kong and Vietnam

Chongqing: Chinese circles are greatly disturbed by recent Japanese broadcasts that criticize French Indochina for allowing weapons, munitions, gasoline, and trucks to pass through its territory into China. General opinion holds that Japan is taking advantage of the internal disorder in France to seize Vietnam. The recent large-scale concentration of Japanese troops on Hainan Island and Nanning seems to confirm these suspicions. Well-informed sources believe that Japanese forces may attempt to occupy Vietnam via Nanning, supported by naval forces off the Vietnamese coast. The French forces in Vietnam are clearly insufficient to deal with such an event. Public opinion believes that the fate of Vietnam will depend on the attitude of Britain and the United States, especially the latter. Yesterday, the National Government held a meeting to discuss the latest developments in the European situation. (Reuters, 19th)

Hong Kong: According to reliable sources, the transshipment of gasoline and oils to inland China via Indochina will soon be halted. This action is said to be in response to a Japanese demand. (Associated Press, 19th)

Hong Kong: The Norwegian ship "Mimosa" and the British ship "Elizabeth" were scheduled to sail to Vietnam yesterday, but could not depart because the authorities in charge of customs clearance refused to issue the necessary documents. It is rumored that the issuance of customs clearance for all ships wishing to sail to Vietnam is currently under consideration. At the same time, British and Allied ships at sea have been ordered not to sail to French ports. (Reuters, 19th)

Tokyo: The Cabinet met yesterday to discuss the European war situation. It is believed that the future of Vietnam was also discussed. According to semi-official Japanese sources, diplomatic observers feel that Japan is as concerned about maintaining the status quo in French Indochina as it is about maintaining the status quo in the Dutch East Indies. Therefore, these observers expect the Japanese government to take diplomatic steps to achieve this goal, especially since Vietnam has now become an important route for the Chongqing government to transport remaining war materials. (Reuters, 19th)

Hong Kong: News from here today indicates that all ships sailing from Hong Kong to French Indochina have been suspended indefinitely. (Associated Press, 19th)

Tokyo: When the spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry met with reporters today, some inquired about a report in yesterday's Yomiuri Shimbun that the Japanese government had decided to ask Germany and Italy to fully respect Japan's position in East Asia, especially regarding French Indochina. The spokesman replied that he could not comment on this matter. He also stated that the Japanese government is paying serious attention to the Vietnam issue for strategic reasons. The Sino-Japanese war has now reached its final or most important stage, and Vietnam has become the only important route for the Chongqing government to import arms and supplies. Therefore, Japan is now focusing its efforts on eliminating this route. Japan, as a strong nation maintaining stability in East Asia, was clearly stated in the initial Anglo-Japanese Alliance diplomatic documents. When asked about an Associated Press report from Rome that Hitler and Mussolini might demand that France cede Vietnam to Japan, the spokesman replied that he regarded this only as newspaper news. As for the report that Britain, France, and the United States may be negotiating joint administration of Vietnam, he had not received any official information and therefore believed that such an event would not occur. (Reuters, 19th)

Tokyo: The Japanese government today again protested to France about the transshipment of military supplies to Chongqing through Vietnam. Masayuki Tani, the Japanese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, recently summoned French Ambassador to Japan Arsène-Henry to the Foreign Ministry and presented him with a letter of protest. It is reported that the French Ambassador replied to Tani Masayuki that France is automatically taking appropriate measures in Vietnam to prevent military supplies from passing through Vietnam to Chongqing. (Associated Press, 19th)

Tokyo: The Yomiuri Shimbun, a newspaper here with close ties to military circles, warned Indochina when Japan protested to France about Indochina's aid to Chongqing, saying that if Japan's protest did not produce concrete results, Japanese troops would be forced to take military measures to stop such aid. The newspaper claimed that today's protest was a final warning, and that if Indochina, after receiving this protest, still failed to stop the supply of military materials to the Chongqing government, Japanese troops would naturally take the necessary measures to completely cut off this military transport. (Associated Press, 19th)

Tokyo: The Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mr. Suma, stated that due to the surrender of the French army to Germany, Japan, for the sake of security in the Far East, could not but be concerned about Indochina. Not only did Japan rely on the tin, rice, and coal produced there, but the Japanese government was also paying close attention to the transshipment of military supplies through the region to inland China and was considering ways to prevent it. Suma refused to comment on reports in the Japanese press that the Japanese government was planning to explain Japan's position to the German and Italian governments, explaining that Japan was a country responsible for maintaining stability in the Far East. According to Japanese newspapers, the Japanese government will notify Germany and Italy that Japan wants to maintain the status quo in Indochina and cannot ignore any changes in the political status of Indochina and the Dutch East Indies.

### Britain Prepares for a Long War; Confident of Ultimate Victory; Churchill Reports on the War Situation in the House of Commons; British Naval and Air Power Hold Absolute Superiority

London: Prime Minister Churchill, yesterday, in the House of Commons, when recounting the details of the sensational events of the previous few days, declared amidst cheers that Britain and the British Empire would continue to fight, even if it meant enduring for several years and standing alone. Mr. Churchill announced the British Empire's determination to continue the struggle and stated that all the Dominions were prepared to join the war until final victory. After detailing the safe evacuation of approximately 350,000 British troops, representing seven-eighths of the total British forces sent to France, along with a large amount of equipment, Mr. Churchill further detailed the government's efforts to prepare for a possible German invasion. He stated that, at present, there were a total of 1.25 million soldiers under arms, in addition to 500,000 local volunteer defense corps. This force would continue to grow, and troops from the Dominions would also participate in protecting the homeland.

Mr. Churchill continued by explaining the difficulties that German invading forces would encounter. Britain's strong internal defenses would require an overwhelmingly large invading force, supported by powerful naval vessels. At this point, Mr. Churchill reminded the audience that, "In short, we still have the Navy. The Navy's duty is to annihilate any large-scale maritime expeditionary force before it reaches the coast, or as it is approaching. The entire coastline is protected by extensive minefields. The Admiralty has begun to take steps to counter any new weapons that the Germans may invent. "Speaking about air power, Mr. Churchill said that, although the British Air Force was smaller in number than the German Air Force, it was a powerful tool, and its pilots and aircraft had proven their superior quality in numerous battles. Although the German forces had been victorious in Holland, Belgium, and France, all of the government's expert advisors agreed that Britain should continue to fight and had good and reasonable hope of ultimate victory.

Encouraging Unity to Overcome Difficulties

Mr. Churchill also opposed criticizing previous British governments, saying, "Today, many people wish to investigate the actions of the government and Parliament in recent years that have led to this catastrophe. They seek to punish those responsible for guiding our affairs." (Cries of "Listen! Listen!") "This is foolish and harmful behavior. Know that there are far too many responsible parties to investigate exhaustively. Everyone should examine their own conscience and reflect on their words, just as I do. I can assert that if we start a conflict between the past and the present, we will lose our future." (Cries of "Listen! Listen!") "Therefore, I cannot condone making any distinctions among the members of the current government. It must be known that the current government was formed in a time of crisis, with the aim of uniting the opinions of all parties and all sectors. It has received the almost unanimous support of both houses. Its members intend to stand on the same ground and obey the House of Commons. They will govern the country and engage in warfare." (Cheers) "But in today's era, there is one absolute necessity: each member who attempts to fulfill their duty day by day must be respected. Their subordinates must also know that their leaders are not puppets, here today and gone tomorrow. Any guidance they give must be strictly and faithfully followed. If we do not do this, we will not be able to cope with the current difficulties. I believe that it would not be very beneficial for this House to extend this debate this afternoon in an open meeting. We plan to convene a closed-door meeting on Thursday. I believe that this is a good opportunity for many people to express their opinions sincerely and for the House of Commons to discuss important matters, without allowing our dangerous enemies to read everything the next morning."

Prepared to Fight Alone

"I am not surprised by the events that have transpired in France in the past two weeks. In fact, I made every effort to clearly state the worst possibilities two weeks ago. I also stated at that time that no matter what happens in France, it will not affect Britain and the British Empire's determination to continue fighting. If necessary, we are prepared to fight even if it means enduring for several years and standing alone." (Cheers)

"In the past few days, we have successfully evacuated the majority of the tens of thousands of troops on the transportation lines in France. Seven-eighths of the troops sent to France since the beginning of the war (350,000 out of 400,000) have returned home safely." (Cheers) "The rest are currently fighting alongside the French army and have achieved great victories in local engagements. We have also transported back a large amount of military supplies, rifles, and various munitions that have been sent to France over the past nine months. Therefore, we now have a very large and powerful force on this island, including our best and most experienced troops. Hundreds of thousands of them have already fought against the Germans and feel that they are no less capable than the German army." (Cheers) "Today, there are more than 1.25 million soldiers under arms on this island, in addition to 500,000 volunteer defense corps, only a portion of whom have not yet received rifles and other weapons. We have enlisted everyone who has a gun in the defense forces. We hope that our weapons will increase significantly in the near future. We also plan to immediately summon and train a large number of soldiers. Those who have not been called up or are engaged in the great task of manufacturing munitions may retain their original jobs to serve the country until they are needed."

Inexhaustible Human Resources

"We also have troops from the Dominions here." (Cries of "Listen! Listen!") "Canadian troops did land in France, but they have now been safely evacuated. Although they expressed disappointment, they maintained excellent order and did not lose any artillery. These Dominion troops will now also participate in the defense of the homeland."

"I fear that the above statement regarding this very large force will raise a question: why did this large army not participate in the great battle in France? I must state that, apart from the divisions that are being trained and organized domestically, only the equipment of twelve divisions has reached the point where it can be deployed overseas. The number of these troops has reached the required number that France hoped to be able to deploy in France in the ninth month of the war. Domestically, our forces will of course gradually increase every week. An invasion of Great Britain would require large-scale transportation, and after transporting the enemy forces across the sea, it would be necessary to maintain them and continuously supply them with the munitions needed for a major war. Once a large army arrives in England, a major war will inevitably break out."

Offshore Invasions Are Not Difficult to Handle

"We should now mention the Navy. In short, we still have a Navy." (Cheers) "Some people seem to have forgotten this. We must remind them, because for more than thirty years, I have always participated in discussions about the possibility of overseas invasion. At the beginning of the last war, I represented the Navy Department and was responsible for transporting all the regular army overseas. However, at that time, our national defense forces had just been called up and were untrained. Therefore, the island had virtually no combat-ready troops for several months. At that time, although Germany had a great battle fleet, with a ratio of ten to sixteen compared to Britain, and could launch a war at any time, the Navy was confident that it could prevent a group attack. Today, the German navy only has two or three ships worth mentioning. We have also received information that the Italian Navy also intends to come to these seas and seize maritime superiority. If Italy really intends to do this, I can only announce that we will gladly grant Mr. Mussolini the convenience of passing through the Strait of Gibraltar, so that he may participate in the work he desires. The British fleet now has a genuine sense of curiosity to see whether the Italian navy still meets the standards of the last war or has completely lost its original strength." (Laughter) "Therefore, in my opinion, in terms of large-scale overseas invasion, our ability to cope with it today is far superior to many periods of the last war and the first few months of this war, when our other troops had not yet been trained, and the British Expeditionary Force had been deployed overseas and was still overseas."

"The British Navy has never claimed that it can prevent an attack by five thousand or ten thousand people, suddenly crossing the sea in the dark of night or a foggy morning and landing at several points on the coast. The effectiveness of maritime power, especially in modern circumstances, depends entirely on whether the invading force is large-scale. Given our military strength, the invaders must be large-scale to be effective. Because it is large-scale, the British Navy can find the enemy and attack. We must know that even if there are five divisions of troops, no matter how lightly equipped, they will need two hundred to two hundred and fifty ships. With the progress of modern aerial reconnaissance and photography, it is not easy to organize such a large-scale military transport, assemble it, and have it cross the ocean without any powerful navy to protect it. There is a great possibility that this military transport will be intercepted long before it reaches the shore. Soldiers will also face the danger of drowning or being pulverized by bombs when attempting to land."

The Enemy, However Cunning, Will Find No Opportunity to Apply His Skill

"We also have a great system of minefields, which have recently been greatly strengthened. Only we know the routes that can be traversed through them. If the enemy attempts to clear a passage through these minefields, the British Navy will destroy any minesweepers and any other forces used to protect them. With our overwhelming superiority at sea, it will not be difficult to carry out this task."

"The above are the normal arguments that we have relied on and which have been well-tested and well-proven in many years of recent wars. However, one question remains: can this solid guarantee be cleverly destroyed by any new method? This may seem unlikely, but the Admiralty is still paying attention to this." (Laughter) "The Admiralty's main duty is to destroy any large-scale overseas expeditionary force before it reaches or as it reaches the coast of the island. It would be neither beneficial nor harmful to elaborate on this, as it would allow others to generate ideas that they may have previously thought of and others may not be willing to explain their true ideas in exchange. All I wish to say is that we must be constantly vigilant. The enemy will devote great effort to studying this problem, as the enemy is cunning and full of new tricks and plans. We are currently using the intelligence and imagination of a large number of well-trained and fully qualified modern personnel to study ways to counter new possibilities. There are many kinds of possibilities that have been proposed, some of which are foolish and ridiculous, while others are not entirely unreasonable. The House of Commons can rest assured that we are taking precautions."

Explaining the Reasons for Failure in the Norwegian Campaign

"Some people will ask why the British Navy could not stop the German action of crossing the Skagerrak to Norway with a large army. It must be known that the conditions in the English Channel and the North Sea are very different from those in the Skagerrak. Due to the distance, we could not provide air support to ships at sea. As a result, because of the proximity of the main enemy air force in that area, we were forced to only use our submarines. We could not implement the decisive blockade or interception that we could implement against warships at sea. Although our submarines sank many enemy ships, they could not prevent the invasion of Norway." Mr. Churchill went on to mention the major issues of aerial invasion and the future struggle between the British and German air forces, saying that "It seems difficult to achieve a large-scale aerial invasion if the British Air Force is not effectively subdued by the enemy. This is the truth and need not be elaborated on."

### The French Government Urges the People to Remain Calm; Cities with Populations Over 20,000 Are Designated as Non-Defended Cities

Bordeaux: Interior Minister Pomaret recently announced on the radio to the nation that all cities with a population of over 20,000 are designated as non-defended cities in order to avoid bombing and war. Even if enemy forces are approaching, all residents should remain in their homes, and all civil servants must not leave their posts without permission, or they will be dismissed immediately. The Minister himself will set an example. Hundreds of men, women, and children have fled from various places in the north to the south, and their suffering is unbearable. This situation is a serious error and should be stopped immediately. At this time of national crisis, our troops are still fighting, and the people in the rear must abide by discipline, remain calm, and act as a support. Otherwise, they will only be troubling themselves and causing unnecessary anxiety. France wants to survive and will surely survive. (Havas, 19th)

### Knowledge for Married Couples: Do You, as a Husband, Understand? Why Does Your Wife Hate You?

— Co-authored by Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor, and Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Intersection of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road

(Hours) 10 AM to 6 PM, Closed Sundays

Woman is great. A man's entire life is simply inseparable from women. Everyone grows up in the embrace of motherly love. Upon reaching adulthood, parents seek a spouse for him, and he himself seeks love. After marriage, he returns to the sweet and tender embrace of his wife's love. If a young husband cannot obtain his wife's love, his misery is likely doubly worse than that of an infant deprived of its mother's embrace!

Do you, young husband, understand why you cannot obtain your wife's love? I hope you are not a fool in life. No matter how high-sounding the reasons for discord between couples may be, marriage is a union based on sexual relations, and the fulfillment or lack thereof in sexual life is the key to your love. If you possess a strong physique and abundant energy, when your wife is filled with youthful passion and affection, the sexual life naturally present between couples will enlighten her, making her feel the value of her husband and the joy of life. Then she will wholeheartedly belong to you. At this time, not only will you feel victorious and happy, but the foundation of your love will also be deeply rooted! Strong love and a rich life are enough to inspire your courage to advance on the great road of life, and help you succeed in building a family and establishing a career! However, if a man has committed self-abuse and nocturnal emissions, or if post-marital debauchery and indulgence have depleted the endocrine fluids of the reproductive glands, which are the source of life, then various symptoms such as premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, dissipated energy, and premature aging will abound. How can such a sick husband, even with a beautiful wife and concubines, coordinate with his wife in married life? Thus, good things often turn into hateful things. How boring is this? At the same time, how can a wife endure wasting her youth and sacrificing her happiness for so long? Some become ill due to depression, while others engage in adultery or elope due to sexual urges. Still others become enraged and use this as an excuse to file for divorce from their husbands. Such cases are countless in today's society!

From the above, it is undeniable that the husband's energy is the driving force behind the love between husband and wife. Therefore, a wise husband will always seek to enhance his energy. If he occasionally feels weak or has the aforementioned symptoms, he should immediately purchase and take "Shengzhi Su," the most effective reproductive gland hormone preparation, to nourish his brain, kidneys, essence, and blood, and nerves. This preparation has been proven by Chinese and foreign doctors to have the effect of producing essence and nourishing the kidneys, promoting development, and continuous use for a month will surely cure various symptoms and make energy twice as strong. Regular use by middle-aged and elderly people can further prolong life, reverse aging, and rejuvenate. However, those with nocturnal emissions must also take "Ximitu's Solid Essence Tablets" to consolidate the essence gate and stop leakage, which will definitely be more effective. When I was in the United States, many famous doctors experimented with and adopted this good medicine, and all achieved amazing results. After I returned to China, I introduced it to the people, and the number of patients who have been cured is no less than 100,000. Therefore, it has long been popular all over the world, and major pharmacies in this city, both Chinese and Western, also sell it.

### Beauty: Effective Treatment for Atrophied Breasts

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

In the past, writers described a woman's walk as "flowers swaying in the breeze." In fact, describing ancient beauties as "flowers swaying in the breeze" is inappropriate, because old-fashioned women with narrow, three-inch golden lilies looked like walking corpses, to put it bluntly. They were not walking at all, they were simply moving their feet. How could there be "flowers swaying in the breeze"? Atrophied breasts? Only the daughters of today's era know the loveliness of beauty. They do not want to have any damage to any part of their body, and let it fully develop until they grow into adults (i.e., fully developed). Then the breasts are high, the person is tall, and the buttocks are high. When these three high positions are combined with a narrow waist, the curve must be beautiful. If you wear high heels, then walking is like "flowers swaying in the breeze."

Indeed, women with high breasts and high buttocks, not to mention that we will feel infinitely intoxicated when we see them in person! Even if we close our eyes and think about it occasionally, we feel that such women have many sweet aftertastes. Therefore, beauty queens occupy all kinds of advantages in materially civilized metropolises. Why not make ordinary backward women feel envy and hatred? However, I want to advise ordinary backward women that it is useless to resent others for not being competitive. Because your backwardness is just a bit lacking in beauty—atrophied breasts, thin buttocks, and lean muscles. If you can take the world-famous gynecological medicine "Shengzhi Su" for women in time, then in less than two months, your complexion will be ruddy, your muscles will be plump, your buttocks will be round, and your breasts will be as high as if they have been inflated. The ancients said: "A scholar should be viewed with new eyes after three days of separation." At this time, can't you also compete with others in social situations? In short, science is indeed great. Defects that people have always thought were regrettable are now satisfactorily resolved. But one thing that I have to ask my female compatriots to pay attention to is that there are many similar drugs on the market. When purchasing, you must resolutely specify "Shengzhi Su" for women, so as not to mistakenly purchase other drugs, which may hinder your health!

### Nocturnal Emission Should Not Be Ignored

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

Is it not an easy thing to seek artemisia for three years for a disease of seven years? However, it is actually ignored! Therefore, we should not be afraid of disease, but only afraid of ignoring disease. Especially for problems like nocturnal emission, which are usually painless and non-itching, it is easiest to make people ignore it. How can you know that painless and non-itching diseases are often the most serious!

The semen in our human body is the most precious endocrine secretion of the reproductive glands, including various valuable endocrine secretions from the pituitary gland, kidney glands, and testicle glands. It usually irrigates the whole body through blood circulation, functioning to help growth, promote metabolism, and nourish the brain, sex organs, spinal cord, and other nerves. If you suffer from nocturnal emission and delay treatment, this endocrine secretion will gradually be exhausted. Then brain failure, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, backache, back pain, kidney deficiency, premature washing, impotence, incomplete development, premature aging, and other symptoms will abound. May I ask, does this kind of man still have a heroic spirit? Not only will he feel a lack of energy and difficulty in coping with his academic and career future, but he will also be ashamed of his wife and hated by his wife, leading to various family tragedies such as elopement and divorce!

However, nocturnal emission is not an incurable disease. Moreover, there is now an invention of a specific medicine. This is "Ximitu's Solid Essence Tablets" secretly made by Dr. Ximitu of Germany. Patients who take this specific medicine can consolidate the essence gate and calm the nerves and stop nocturnal emission on the night after taking it. Even severe nocturnal emission can be cured after taking it for a few days. However, those who already have the above-mentioned symptoms due to nocturnal emission must also take the reproductive hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su" to nourish the brain, kidneys, essence, blood, and nerves. Continuous use for one month will surely cure various symptoms and restore perfect health. If the patient can come to our clinic in this city for diagnosis and treatment, a cure can be guaranteed.

### Ironclad Facts

— Recorded by Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

(1) Young People with Nocturnal Emission Should Not Abandon Themselves

Mr. Chen Fuqing, 22 years old, from Pinghu, was intelligent since childhood and loved to study tirelessly. Therefore, although his family was not very wealthy, he was still able to enjoy the right to university education at a certain university in this city, because his uncle often subsidized him. However, Mr. Chen suffered from nocturnal emission due to excessive use of his brain. At first, it was only three or four times a month, but then it gradually increased. Later, it became inevitable every night. After being too tired, there were occasional spermatorrhea during the day. As a result, his mind was dazed, he often suffered from insomnia at night, and he felt dizzy, bloated, tinnitus, and blurred vision as soon as he thought about it. Therefore, his academic performance plummeted. If he worked a little, he felt sore waist, back pain, and physical exhaustion, and he was almost unable to support himself and could not get out of bed! Mr. Chen was hit by this pain and suddenly developed a pessimistic thought. One day, he wrote a letter of doom and intended to commit suicide by throwing himself into the river. Fortunately, he was discovered and dissuaded by his classmates, and they introduced him to our clinic for diagnosis and treatment. After I examined his symptoms, I instructed his classmates to go to the Wuzhou Pharmacy to purchase two boxes of "Ximitu's Solid Essence Tablets" and two dozen reproductive hormone preparations "Shengzhi Su" and make him take them at the same time. New medical techniques such as electrotherapy injections were also used every other day. After a month of careful diagnosis and treatment, it was only a month until the beginning of this month, and all his illnesses were cured, and he became an active, healthy, studious, and intelligent young man again.

(2) A Husband with Kidney Deficiency Should Think About Your Beloved Wife

Mr. Zhao Zhiming, 26 years old, got married last winter. His wife is indeed a beautiful girl. Although Mr. Zhao loved her, he always felt the pain of being unable to meet her needs in married life. Therefore, their love was also very weak. Mr. Zhao had symptoms of premature ejaculation and impotence after marriage, and occasionally had nocturnal emission. Sometimes, Mr. Zhao thought of his wife and felt extremely guilty and hateful in his heart: so last month, he came to our clinic in person to cure his illness. I immediately instructed him to purchase two dozen reproductive hormone preparations "Shengzhi Su" and one box of "Ximitu's Solid Essence Tablets" and make him take them at the same time. After more than a month, he now feels strong and healthy, and his illness has been completely cured. The love between husband and wife is deep and sincere. Mr. Zhao can truly be said to be a lover of his wife.

### The Situation in Nanyang is Perilous: Japan's Conspiracy in Burma

US President Roosevelt announced last week that the US fleet would remain stationed in the Pacific indefinitely. Admiral Richardson, Commander-in-Chief of the US Navy, also announced yesterday that the US fleet, which was originally scheduled to sail to various ports along the Pacific coast in early July, has now been cancelled. At the same time, according to the Domei News Agency's Hainan Island telegram, Lieutenant General Tanaka, Commander of the Japanese Fleet in China, has arrived on the island to "inspect." The North China Daily News's Tokyo telegram said that the demarcation agreement currently signed between Japan and the Soviet Union can, on the one hand, prevent the recurrence of incidents there this summer, and on the other hand, allow both parties to develop freely elsewhere. Since Japan and the Soviet Union do not need to monitor each other in Manchuria, the Soviet Union can expand in the Baltic Sea and other places as much as possible, and Japan can also take the opportunity to promote its southward policy. Regarding Japan's southward policy, this newspaper has already published two translated articles yesterday. Now, the Shanghai communication published in the New York Times will be translated as follows:

As early as 1892, British Prime Minister Salisbury firmly advocated that the conditions for loans to the Chinese government should stipulate that British capital should be allowed to build a railway connecting Rangoon, Burma, with Sichuan Province in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.

In that era, the Chinese government tried its best to oppose this plan. France's desire to develop northward from Vietnam was also opposed in the same way. However, today, 75,000 patriotic Chinese workers are busy building this railway line, and a British company is providing financial assistance. China is extremely in favor of this, as is France.

This is an important development and a far-reaching plan of political importance, and the reason for this result is due to Japan's invasion of China, the blockade of the Chinese coast, and Japan's occupation of major Chinese ports.

American trade has suffered heavy losses due to Japan's invasion of China, and Burma currently occupies an important new position, not only because it is the back door for China's imports and exports, but also because it is the eastern border of the British Empire on the Asian continent.

Since Japan has practically made the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway lose its use in transporting military supplies, it is paying close attention to the importance of the Yunnan-Burma Highway. But until now, Japan has not bombed the completed highway connecting Chongqing to Burma, and the uncompleted railway in China, but has only been active in Burma, hoping to make this important road for trade and supply lose its effectiveness.

According to the 1931 census, there were only 667 Japanese in Burma. The total number of Japanese currently exceeds 4,000. Currently, in every Burmese village, there is one or two Japanese dentists, and there are photography supply stores, ostensibly selling landscape photos and cheap cameras.

Burmese villagers and farmers do not value modern dentists, and ordinary people are also very poor and unable to love cameras. But these people all believe in the pro-Japanese and anti-British propaganda of Japanese spies, who say that Japan is a nation destined to shoulder the task of liberating the Far East.

The British authorities also understand this situation, because in early 1938, the headquarters of Japanese spies in Yangon spent a lot of time and money to help the Burmese national movement, hoping to use disturbances, riots, and local rebellions to attack the transportation of military supplies to China by the Yunnan-Burma Railway and Highway.

Burma covers an area of 370,000 square miles, and according to the latest census, it has a total of 14,667,000 people. However, these people are divided by ethnic animosity and have 130 different languages. Such a complex social organization is extremely beneficial to Japanese spies, who have obtained the assistance of the extremely ethnic party "Miao Qite" to provoke ethnic hatred.

The party recently issued a notice to the British government and the Governor of Burma, requesting that the transportation of military supplies from Burma to China be terminated.

At the end of 1938, when the Burmese rebellion was at its peak, the Yangon press published the so-called Japanese government's instructions to the Japanese consulate in Yangon, and the Japanese side never denied this document. The main points are as follows:

"The occurrence of the Burmese rebellion can cut off the military supplies transported by the Chongqing government through the mountainous areas of the country to China. The rebels should destroy the bridges on the Burmese border rivers, delaying and endangering the transportation of goods. It is even possible to intercept these military supplies."

Currently, the assistance that China receives from countries around the world lands in Yangon. German assistance is carried by Italian ships without German trademarks. Three American routes currently use Yangon as their port of call.

From Yangon, these military supplies are transported by rail to Lashio on the Sino-Burmese border, or up the Irrawaddy River to Bhamo. From Lashio to the Chinese border, the Burmese government has built a 77-mile highway. From the Sino-Burmese border, the Chongqing-Burma Highway can reach the Chinese capital Chongqing.

An American company has also built a large-scale aircraft factory on the Burmese border, where the Yunnan-Burma Highway connects to China, and another factory is being built in Yangon.

If China dispatches 100 transport vehicles a day on the border, each carrying 300 tons, then 9,000 tons of important military supplies will be imported every month. However, the journey from the car to Chongqing takes two weeks, so 1,400 transport vehicles must be maintained to travel back and forth. This number does not include cars dedicated to carrying gasoline and parts.

China currently operates 1,000 military vehicles on this highway, which can be open to traffic for seven months a year, and imports 6,000 tons per month. In total, June to October is the secluded season. At that time, floods will destroy bridges and damage the roadbed, so the road cannot be used to its full capacity for transportation.

As for exports, all the cars of the Chinese government are mainly used to transport China's most profitable export goods, such as tung oil, bristles, leather, , , and the like.

At the same time, China is continuing to carry out railway construction work, and the railway traffic from Chongqing to Yangon will soon be completed. The roadbed is progressing quickly, and many tunnels have already been dug. In some areas, the tracks have already been laid. It is hoped that this line can be completed in 1941. By then, the line from Yangon to Lashio in Burma can be extended to the Sino-Burmese border and connected to the railway in the kingdom, and Salisbury's 48-year-old plan can be realized.

Britain began to conquer Burma in 1824, but did not conquer the entire territory until 1886. Burma used to be four independent kingdoms and was merged with India for many years, but in 1937, Britain, fearing the development of the national liberation movement, separated it from India and became another colony.

From a military point of view, Burma is India's second important defense line, and Singapore is the first important defense line. In today's situation, although the European war is imminent, strengthening the eastern defense of Burma is still very important--the obvious purpose is to target Japan--currently 14% of Burma's income is used for military purposes.

In July 1939, the Governor of India had a long and important meeting with the Governor of Burma and other military experts on adjusting the national defense plan. As a result of this meeting, the production of important military supplies in Burma has been increased, the air force has also been expanded, the number of airfields has more than doubled, and the coastal defense has also been improved.

Burma's main wartime products are kerosene, iron sand, coal, lead, tungsten, rice, and ramie.

This vast area has now become an important frontier for Britain. The European people residing there, including military and civil servants, number only 28,000. Apart from this, there are only a very small number of Central American people.

### A Bad Harvest is Bound to Follow a Great War: Europe is on the Brink of Famine

For several months, this reporter has traveled through most of Europe. From what I have observed, I am convinced that Europe will encounter famine. This reporter stayed as a guest for seven days at the home of a large landowner in a wealthy area of a Romanian border province. The landowner apologized and said, "A year ago, I should have sent a car to meet you, but now the cars have been requisitioned by the army, and even the farm's heavy vehicles and tractors have been requisitioned. We have to use wheelbarrows instead. The 'we' are the strong men who have gone to the army, leaving behind the old, disabled, women, and children, who depend on each other to survive. At this time next year, there will be nothing to eat and hunger will be rampant."

From here to the north, the Soviet army is eyeing. Extensive wheat fields have been dug into winding and continuous trenches. The reporter then crossed the Bukovina region, which is a grain-producing area in Germany. Germany takes at least 12% of its livestock and wheat from this area. However, the railway tracks there are extremely crowded with oil being transported to Germany, and there is no food transportation at all.

There are still 100,000 Polish refugees in Romania, who consume a lot of food every day. Romania is in danger of being attacked from three sides, so it mobilized an army of 2 million people, who eat their fill and do nothing, allowing agricultural affairs to be abandoned. Passing through Yugoslavia, Turkey, Greece, and Bulgaria, what I saw and heard was the same sight: soldiers idling all day long, and the surrounding fields were barren.

Italy's food problem is also very serious. Only 1/10 of the country's land is arable, and its colonies supply very little. Even the small amount of food supplied by the Balkan Peninsula is bought by countries such as Britain and France. Food prices in Italy have soared by 1/10 in a week. Profiteers hoard goods for speculation. In one month, 33,000 such unscrupulous merchants were arrested.

The situation in Spain is even worse. A year ago, the government army and the National Army faced off against each other, ravaging the entire country. Wherever the army passed, the food was looted, and the orchards were razed to the ground. All livestock that could fill the stomach were slaughtered. Even other livestock that could be milked instead of cows could not be bought even with high compensation. Villagers have gone without milk and bread for many days.

Hungary had a poor harvest last year, and 100,000 Polish refugees are pouring in. The country has adjusted bread production and stipulated that meat should not be eaten on two days of each week. The country has a population of about 1 million, most of whom are farmers, who are now also bound by weapons. Other countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium have also suffered from military disasters and are already known for their food shortages. (To be continued)

### National Northwest Institute of Technology Actively Expanding; Practice Factory to Cooperate with the Department of Construction; Establishment of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Specialist Programs Planned

(Hanzhong Airmail) The National Northwest Institute of Technology, formed by the merger and reorganization of the Beiyang, Pingmin, Dongda, and Jiaozuo Institutes of Technology, has been actively reorganized by President Lai Lian in the past two years. It has not only become the only "engineering university" in the Northwest, but has also become a large-scale engineering academic institution in the country. There are nine hundred students. This year, the civil engineering, mechanical engineering, aeronautical engineering, electrical engineering, mining and metallurgy, chemical engineering, and textile engineering graduates total more than 160. All have been introduced by the institute to various factories and production and construction agencies and have been hired by various parties. After the graduation ceremony in early June, they will depart for various places to accept employment. In addition to the existing eight engineering departments and the Institute of Engineering Research and the Department of Engineering Academic Extension, the institute plans to add mechanical and electrical engineering specialist courses. New students will be enrolled through a unified examination by the Ministry of Education; the institute does not conduct its own enrollment. It is estimated that the total number of students in the next academic year will be over one thousand. The current school buildings are insufficient. The construction of student and faculty dormitories is underway. Classrooms, physics, chemistry, mining and metallurgy, hydraulic engineering laboratories, and the library are also being actively expanded. A site has been purchased outside Hanzhong for the construction of a practice factory, which will cooperate with the Shaanxi Department of Construction to promote the machine industry. The director of the department is concurrently held by Mao Lian. The deans of academic affairs, general affairs, the Institute of Engineering Research, and the Department of Extension are Pan Chengxiao, Yuan Jian, Liu Xiying, and Wang Wenhua, respectively. Several professors will be added in the next academic year, and graduate student quotas will be increased in each department of the Institute of Engineering Research.

### Shanghai Provincial High School Holds Early Summer Vacation

Since its reorganization in the 16th year of the Republic [1927], Shanghai Provincial High School has consistently followed the established laws and regulations of the Nationalist Government's Ministry of Education and the various instructions of President Chiang in its school management policies. Since the "August 13th" incident, the school moved to the French Concession to hold classes. However, this semester, the school has experienced successive disturbances. Initially, the students' patriotic movement had pure motives, and although their actions slightly overstepped the bounds, the school still maintained them. Later, the focus of their actions suddenly shifted to the school, and they refused guidance, even acknowledging and guaranteeing the conditions they demanded. It is said that the conditions they put forward were numerous, the main ones being as follows: 1. The school authorities must provide a written guarantee that the school will never be changed to a private school. 2. No students involved in patriotic activities may be expelled during the summer vacation. 3. Junior high school third-year students should all be allowed to graduate, and a graduation grade review committee should be organized by the students. After the teachers in charge have graded the papers for each subject, they must be submitted to the committee for review and examination, with the students determining the grades themselves. 4. Junior high school graduates should all be allowed to advance to the first year of senior high school, and after the teachers have graded the entrance examination papers, they must also be submitted to student representatives for review. 5. Students should be allowed to be selected as representatives to attend school affairs committee meetings. 6. Any increase or decrease in teaching staff must first be approved by the students. The school affairs committee considered the above requirements to be beyond the scope of what could be accepted. Therefore, on the 15th of this month, it convened a school affairs committee and a teachers' meeting, and unanimously resolved to advance the start of the summer vacation to June 18th in order to carry out a rectification. It is said that the missed lessons will be made up by starting the next semester early. (Dahua News Agency)

The Tong Guang team, led by Ting Du, set off in the early dawn. After a short break, the competition began, with Ding Du and Luo Ertuo serving as referees in turn.

### With the Situation Turbulent and Unstable, Shanghai Residents Should Remain Calm and Composed; The Free City Proposal is Not Taken Seriously by All Parties; British and French Ambassadors Remain Temporarily in Shanghai to Deal with the Situation

Since Italy's entry into the war, the situation has expanded to the Mediterranean. On one hand, there are peace messages from France and Germany, while the fascist ambitions in the East are flourishing. Taking advantage of this rare opportunity, they are increasingly obviously attempting to encircle the South. As a result, the people of Shanghai are shaken and full of suspicion. The puppet regime is also taking the opportunity to steal fire. It is said that the puppet "mayor" Fu Xiao'an yesterday submitted a formal written request to the consuls of the warring countries, requesting that the defense forces of the warring countries withdraw from the concessions. At the same time, foreign newspapers suggested turning Shanghai into a free city. This has made people even more uneasy. In reality, the evolution of the European war has nothing to do with the Far East. At most, it will have a slight impact on shipping. The defense forces of the concessions have planned perfectly in response to Chuan Xiaoan's request and should not cause any friction. There is no need to worry too much. The so-called free city was proposed during the August 13th incident. This matter is related to Chinese sovereignty and has not been realized. Now it is nothing more than a rehash of old ideas. The United States' consistent policy towards China is that it does not recognize any changes in Chinese sovereignty and territory by force or other means. There is no doubt that the current proposal will be opposed by the United States. However, since receiving news from Hong Kong yesterday that the Japanese army had launched a three-pronged attack on Liangshan from the border of Guangxi Province, and that the sea routes between Haiphong and Hong Kong were blocked, people in the market have been in a state of flux. In fact, in this situation, everything should be handled with a calm attitude, maintained with composure, and not be moved by rumors. Only then can one be at ease. The situation in all directions is summarized as follows:

Someone Suggests Establishing a Free City

According to the English-language *China Press*, foreigners in Shanghai have suggested that Shanghai be designated as a "free city" to ensure the future safety of the international city. According to the plan, all of Shanghai would become a demilitarized zone, with neutral zones set up around it. The "free city" would include five zones: Zone A is the current International Settlement; Zone B is the French Concession; Zone C is the area north of the Suzhou Creek and the extraterritorial roads there; Zone D is the area south of the French Concession and south of Hongqiao Road; Zone E is the area on the right bank of the Huangpu River. This "free city" would have separate courts, police, pilotage management, and other agencies, and would be jointly managed by the great powers. According to this plan, Shanghai would become an internationally managed protection political and economic municipal institution. It is also said that the above plan was formulated by the Consular Body and is in the form of a memorandum.

Consular Body's Stance

The Consular Body's Secretary, Mr. Lange, dismissed this rumor as nonsense. Mr. Lange pointed out that in the past few years, there have indeed been proposals for such a plan, but he is absolutely unaware of it at present. According to an observer, this plan was proposed during the August 13th incident. Now that the old story is being retold, it is considered to be a selfish proposal by financial capitalists. Due to the large-scale rumor offensive by a certain party, people are panicked, and these people are making this tentative proposal to maintain their huge floating capital so that they can do evil in Shanghai.

Harmful to China's Territorial Sovereignty

According to an international expert, the plan is likely the opinion of one or two individuals on the foreign side. The territorial sovereignty of the Shanghai Concession belongs entirely to China. According to the plan, the territory would be fundamentally divided, separated from China, and greatly damage China's territorial sovereignty. If this plan were to be realized, it would never be tolerated by the Chinese government.

Seeking Security Requires Cooperation

The person also said that the proper way to stabilize the current concession is for all countries to adhere to the resolutions passed in the past and to maintain the status quo together. Although a certain party has wild ambitions and is watching intently, as long as all countries cooperate closely and respond calmly, that party will have no way to use its skills. The current tranquility of the concession is really due to the proper measures taken by all countries. At this time, if there is a sudden proposal for a "free city" plan, it would only be self-disturbance and provide an opportunity for others to take advantage of it.

Few Puppet Troops in the Suburbs of Shanghai

Yesterday, the English-language *China Press* stated that it was reported that 50,000 puppet troops from Nanjing had secretly arrived in Shanghai from the Jiangning area, causing concerns here about seizing the Shanghai concessions. The arrival of these puppet troops was said to have followed the news of the development of the European war. It was rumored that the Japanese and puppet troops were planning to seize the French Concession. At the same time, it was learned that the French Concession had taken emergency precautions to prevent any unforeseen developments. The authorities stated that all matters within the concession would continue as usual. As for future developments, the French Concession officials remained silent, but said that the status quo would be fully maintained unchanged. When asked about the rumors that Japan would take direct action against the Shanghai concessions, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy said that the rumors were completely unfounded, but declared that "If there are very significant changes in the European situation, Japan may take some action." However, other Chinese sources said that there are no more than one or two thousand puppet troops in the suburbs of Shanghai. Among them, several hundred who arrived in Nanshi are the puppet "water patrol team" under Ren Yuandao.

British and French Ambassadors Remain Temporarily in Shanghai

British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the morning of the 16th of this month. During this extraordinary period, the ambassador's whereabouts were kept secret, and it was impossible to know which ship he was on. After arriving, he went to the Guanchiu residence on Dunxin Road to rest for a few days, keeping a low profile and rarely socializing. His future whereabouts have not yet been decided. French Ambassador Cosme, who was previously scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 16th to go to Beidaihe for the summer, has not yet left. Since the news of France seeking peace with Germany spread to Shanghai, the staff of the French Consulate, from top to bottom, have been extremely busy. The French Ambassador has also canceled his trip to North China. After the Soviet Consulate was closed, it was once rumored that it would be reopened and that a new policy would be determined after the stationing of Soviet troops, but this was not accurate. Therefore, the Soviet Consulate remains closed. As for the Soviet official news agency in Shanghai, it continues to exist. Recently, the Moscow headquarters sent a new person to Shanghai to take charge.

Italian Side Making Every Effort to Prevent Friction

Since Italy entered the war, the nationals and embassies of various countries in China have recently advised Italian military and civilians in Shanghai to avoid unfortunate incidents with nationals of the warring countries. At the same time, the Italian Consul General in Tianjin and Chairman of the Italian Concession Works Bureau, Mr. Buriki, and the Military Attaché and Guard Commander of the Italian Embassy in Peiping, Mr. Ke Huaxini, also notified Italian expatriates to avoid friction with expatriates from the warring countries. The British and French concession authorities in various parts of China are making every effort to maintain the neutrality of the concessions. Both German and Italian expatriates in the British and French concessions in Shanghai and Tianjin continue to reside as usual. Only a very small number have moved, so incidents between each other have not occurred. Moreover, with the diplomatic authorities of the United States in China mediating and arbitrating, the troubles can be eliminated before they take shape, so that those who covet it have nothing to rely on.

### Japanese Soldiers Praise Chinese Soldiers; Soldiers and Officers in Xiangxi are Happy to Die in Battle; Yichang Garrison Engages in Melee Combat

Colonel Mabuchi, head of the reporting department of the Japanese Army Headquarters in Nanjing, recently went to Nangxi to personally inspect the war situation. According to his observations, although there have been cases of entire armies surrendering in Europe, including the commander-in-chief, the Chinese soldiers in Xiangxi never surrender in groups. From Zhang Zizhong onwards, the officers and soldiers all fought bravely to the death. The battle in the mountains north of Yichang also progressed to bayonet combat, followed by hand-to-hand combat (meaning melee combat). This kind of spirit is different from the soldiers on the European battlefield. Mabuchi also praised this as a "spirit of selflessness and dedication to the public."

### Optimistic View of Conditions in Mainland China by American Doctor: Abundant Grain Reserves, Progress in All Areas

Dr. Brown, an American physician who has worked in the missionary medical field in China for many years and whose footprints have covered almost all of China, recently arrived in Shanghai from the mainland. He will soon travel to Japan before returning to the United States. During his brief stay in Shanghai, he told reporters about the general situation in the mainland. According to Dr. Brown, he firmly believes that China will ultimately achieve victory and expressed admiration for the great spirit and work displayed in the various areas of Free China. He said there is no fear of food shortages in the mainland, and Sichuan Province in particular has a surplus of grain. The people in the mainland are well-informed about various current events and understand various difficulties. What is particularly surprising is that small villages in remote parts of the mainland often have small wireless radio crystal sets, which they use to listen to the latest news and immediately relay it to the residents of surrounding villages. Dr. Brown recounted, "I remember an old worker who, when I told him I was American, immediately beamed and said to me, 'We all know that America is helping our China.'" Dr. Brown also mentioned that the chairman of Shanxi Province is currently training three thousand young officers in Shaanxi to prepare them for service on the front lines. He told me that although the Japanese army has occupied all of Shanxi Province, the magistrates of all the counties, except for one or two large towns, are loyal to the country. A local official in a certain county in the mainland told Dr. Brown that the people throughout the mainland are united in spirit, which is especially evident in the enthusiasm of the people enlisting in the army. This is largely due to the excessive bombing by Japanese aircraft.

Dr. Brown then told reporters how villages train small groups of personnel, who then gather at larger central points for further training. The number of Chinese aircraft is still insufficient, but small arms are now being manufactured domestically in China, with a very large output. An officer of the Eighth Route Army once told him, "The arsenals of Tokyo do not disappoint us," meaning that the Eighth Route Army has seized large quantities of military supplies from the Japanese army.

### French Government Seals Off Haiphong: A Temporary Precaution, Shanghai Ships to Stop at Hong Kong

After the expansion of the European war, various rumors have also surfaced in the Far East. Rumors about the seizure of the Dutch East Indies and the South Sea Islands have recently subsided. Since Paris was occupied by the German army, there have been even more rumors of an advance into French Indochina. Yesterday afternoon, shipping circles in this city received a report from the Haiphong branch stating that the French government, as a precautionary measure, has temporarily sealed off Haiphong, prohibiting entry and exit. All ships traveling to Haiphong from Hong Kong have been suspended indefinitely.

Yusheng Ticket Refunds

Jardine Matheson's Yusheng, originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Haiphong this morning, is refunding all Haiphong passenger tickets sold due to the above news. Shippers of cargo bound for Haiphong have also been notified to withdraw their customs declarations. The ship will temporarily only go as far as Hong Kong, awaiting further news. If possible, it still plans to sail to Haiphong. The Taikoo Company's Jinan, which sailed from Shanghai to South China yesterday afternoon, heading to Hong Kong, Guangzhou Bay, Haikou, and then Haiphong, had already departed when the news of the Haiphong blockade reached Shanghai, so it may still be able to reach Haiphong. A decision will be made after arriving in Hong Kong. However, inquiries to the company indicate that there has been no confirmation.

Shipping Manifests Suspended

Hong Kong authorities are refusing to issue departure manifests for ships sailing to Haiphong. This news has been confirmed by shipping circles in this port yesterday. However, it is said that this measure may be temporary. Many shipping companies in this port own numerous ships that travel between Shanghai and French Indochina, with the transport of Saigon rice being the largest part of this shipping. Most rice ships do not stop in Hong Kong but sail directly between Shanghai and Haiphong. The current attitude of the Hong Kong authorities is precautionary, awaiting future developments.

### Contents of the Shanghai Free City as Reported by Western Newspaper

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that after the news of France's surrender to Germany reached the city a few days ago, the general public became increasingly concerned about the maintenance of the status quo in Shanghai. However, in the uncertain situation, a glimmer of hope has emerged: the consuls of various countries and the authorities of the concessions in Shanghai are currently studying a plan to make Shanghai a self-governing city, in order to protect the future safety of this international metropolis. This plan was drafted in the form of a memorandum by a foreign official for the study of officials from various countries in Shanghai. The main content stipulates that Shanghai be transformed into a politically and economically autonomous city, jointly protected and managed by various countries. Its main purpose is to ensure the safety and stability of the entire Shanghai area and to secure a more solid position in the future. According to the plan, the entire Shanghai area would be demilitarized, and a neutral zone would be demarcated around the city. An independent court system, not subject to Chinese jurisdiction, would be established, along with a joint Chinese-Western police force and separate organizations to manage port affairs. Municipal affairs would be decided by the General Council, and the entire city would be divided into five districts for management. If this plan were implemented, it would eliminate the problem of returning the concessions. The plan is divided into seventeen articles as follows:

Demilitarized Zone Around the Perimeter

(1) A demilitarized zone shall be established around Shanghai, the boundaries of which shall be determined by Japanese military experts in consultation with British, American, French, and Italian military experts. (2) China and the five countries enjoying extraterritorial rights, namely Great Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Japan, shall conclude a treaty within this demilitarized zone (including the International Settlement, the French Concession, Greater Shanghai, and other areas deemed to be included, as well as surrounding waterways) to establish an autonomous city and a free port, jointly protected and managed by the aforementioned countries. All previously concluded treaties related to the two concessions and the Huangpu River shall be canceled. (3) No Chinese or other foreign troops shall enter or use the area or waterways within this demilitarized zone. Chinese and other foreign military aircraft shall also not fly over the area.

Organizations Formed by Representatives of Various Countries

(4) The autonomous city and the neutral zone, as well as all waterways, shall be managed by organizations formed by representatives of various countries. (5) The autonomous city shall be divided into five districts, each with a branch office for management. District A shall be the former International Settlement, District B shall be the French Concession, District C shall be the area from the mouth of the Huangpu River to the northern bank of Suzhou Creek, including the International Settlement and the extra-settlement roads, District D shall be the area south of the French Concession from the Huangpu River to the Hongqiao Road, and District E shall be Pudong. (6) The purpose of establishing the autonomous city and the autonomous port is to gradually unify police, taxes, sanitation, and public works.

Attempt to Break Away from Chinese Judiciary

(7) The autonomous city shall establish a new judicial system, separate from the Chinese judicial system. However, some Chinese laws shall still be adopted, while the remainder shall be drafted by legal experts, taking into account the situation in Shanghai, and approved by the countries concerned. (8) Each of the five districts of the autonomous city shall have a court, including an appellate court and a supreme court. Chinese judges shall hear all cases involving Chinese citizens. Disputes between Chinese and foreign citizens shall be heard by two judges, one Chinese and one foreign. The appellate court shall have three judges, one Chinese and two foreign. In addition, a special court shall be established to hear cases brought by and against the General Bureau and branch offices of the autonomous city. (9) Until the new laws described in Article 7 are adopted, the current laws shall remain in effect. The autonomous city shall be established, and the new courts shall be established accordingly. After the new laws described in Article 7 are established, the extraterritorial rights of the various countries shall be abolished immediately.

Appointment of Senior Personnel

(10) To avoid various difficulties, all personnel in the two concessions shall not be transferred for the time being. (11) The committee organized by representatives of various countries shall nominate senior personnel for the administrative organs of the autonomous city and the courts of each district. (12) Senior personnel in general for all organs of the autonomous city shall be appointed from the nationals of the countries that signed the above-mentioned treaty.

No Chinese Government Offices Within the Zone

(13) Chinese government offices shall not be located within the autonomous city, with the exception of customs, post offices, and diplomatic missions. However, they shall pay taxes in accordance with regulations, and customs shall also pay a portion of its tax revenue to cover the expenses of the autonomous city. (14) The port authority shall be separated from customs and become an independent agency. (15) The railway stations within the autonomous city shall be managed by the authorities of the autonomous city and shall pay taxes accordingly. (16) A joint Chinese-foreign police force shall be established, under the command of the authorities of the autonomous city. (17) All other police forces or protection forces shall be managed by subsidiary organs designated by the authorities of the autonomous city.

### Important Future Tasks: Expansion of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps; British Businesses Urge Employees to Join; English Contingent Increases by Over a Hundred

Since the British Consulate issued an advisory to British expatriates in Shanghai to join the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, the response from British expatriates at the time was not enthusiastic. However, a considerable number of Norwegian expatriates from the Scandinavian Peninsula and Jewish refugees have joined. There are also German expatriates who have joined. According to inquiries from reliable sources by the Ping Ming News Agency, British expatriates, recognizing the urgent need to expand the strength of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, have seen British businesses, such as two well-known foreign firms, not only encourage their employees to join the corps, but also offer various incentives, such as issuing cash rewards. Therefore, the number of English troops has increased sharply in the past week, with over a hundred new members. Moreover, the corps' firearms and ammunition are very plentiful. However, in terms of uniforms, the Shanghai Municipal Council is limited by funds and has been unable to purchase new ones for the time being, so they are temporarily using the old uniforms. According to well-informed foreigners, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps has made great contributions in the past to assisting the police force's shortcomings, and its tasks in the future will be even more important.

### Permission Granted for Resumption of Service by Maersk Line Vessels: First Vessel Scheduled to Arrive Tomorrow; Considered Neutral Vessels by All Parties

After the outbreak of World War II in Europe, in early April of this year, German troops suddenly seized Denmark and conquered Norway, and the situation in Europe suddenly became tense. This was the first stage of expansion of the European war. Then, in early May, German troops continued to advance into Holland and Belgium. This was the second stage of the expansion of the European war, and the situation became even more serious. The shipping industry in various countries has been greatly affected. As a result, the schedules and routes of merchant ships from the United Kingdom, France, Holland, and Norway traveling to the Far East have all been kept secret. The vessels of the Danish shipping companies, Jebsen & Co. and Maersk Line, have all successively suspended service and been ordered to concentrate in Hong Kong. Although the vessels belonging to Maersk Line fly the Danish flag, their organization is slightly different. It is a joint venture established by Danish and American merchants, operating on the Pacific route. Therefore, after the Danish ships suspended service, the Maersk vessels docked in the United States and the former U.S. territory of Little Luzon. The American shareholders, seeing that the Maersk vessels would be suspended indefinitely, causing great losses, petitioned the U.S. government for protection and permission to resume service. It has recently been heard that the U.S. government has obtained the consent of the British and French governments and the Shanghai military authorities to recognize the Maersk vessels as neutral ships and to guarantee their safe passage. The Maersk Line shipping company at 210 Jiujiang Road in this city has received official notification, and the vessels have already set sail from their moorings and are sailing to Shanghai to resume service. It is said that the first vessel to arrive in Shanghai will be the Ms. Nlel Maersk. This vessel was previously docked in Little Luzon and has now departed from Little Luzon, scheduled to arrive around the 21st (of this month). It is scheduled to resume service from Shanghai to the United States on Sunday (the 23rd), first going to Los Angeles, then passing through Panama, New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. Two vessels traveling from the United States to Shanghai are the Ms. Grete Maersk and the Ms. Halda Maersk, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai around the 8th of next month and scheduled to depart from Shanghai directly to Little Luzon on the 10th at the same time. Hong Kong is British territory, so in accordance with the U.S. government's Neutrality Act, it will temporarily bypass Taiwan and Hong Kong. The Dong Hui Kee Shipping Agency, which is responsible for the company's cargo solicitation, also issued a Chinese announcement yesterday in accordance with the English notice from Maersk Line, soliciting cargo from various clients.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Begins Crackdown on Grain Market: Led by Mr. Betts; Cooperation with French Concession

The Shanghai Municipal Council, in order to crack down on illegal profiteering and other misconduct related to rice and grain, has decided to select a number of internal staff members to work with representatives of the French Concession's Price Control Committee to guide this matter, and has appointed Mr. Betts of the Health Department to be in charge. The above organization will make recommendations to the Board of Directors as necessary.

### Chamber of Commerce Introduces Aluminum Coin Usage

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in view of the fact that previous issuances of aluminum coins were limited to the financial sector, and their circulation has not been widespread, now after consultation with the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks, has decided to select the most important industries and have the Chamber of Commerce issue letters of introduction. Each trade association will then send representatives directly to the Joint Reserve Committee to discuss the method of application for use, so as to compile and apply for, and then distribute to members of the trade.

### Harana Suffers Minor Accident: Paper Burned, Losses Not Large; Currently Undergoing Repairs to the Hull

The German Far Eastern Company's Harana, which travels the Shanghai-Wenzhou route, sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou last week with cargo and was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai from Wenzhou on the 18th. According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the ship suffered an accident in the cargo hold while loading cargo at the Wenzhou wharf on the 17th. The company received a telegram from the ship yesterday stating that the accident involved the paper cargo, and that a few pieces of flammable paper were burned due to carelessness with fire.

### Fate of Refugees Perilous, Misappropriation of Refugee Donations: Relief Association Has Entrusted Lawyers to File Lawsuit; Refugees in Nanshi, Hearing of Dissolution, Anxious and Helpless

The general manager of the Dafang Hotel on Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession is Shen Yongkang, and the business is doing quite well. Since November of the year before last, he has been entrusted by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association to collect a five-percent refugee donation. The Travel Industry Association sends representatives to collect and remit the donations to the Refugee Association on a monthly basis, which issues official receipts. However, the amount remitted each month is only about three or four hundred yuan. The Association, based on the hotel's turnover, calculates that the amount is far short, which is highly suspicious. Recently, a traveler reported to the Association that the hotel had misappropriated refugee donations. After receiving the report, the Association immediately dispatched a lawyer and an accountant to audit the hotel's accounts. It was immediately discovered that the hotel could collect six or seven hundred yuan in refugee donations each month, but the amount remitted was only half of that. From November of the 27th year to May of this year, the total amount misappropriated reached five or six thousand yuan. When questioned, the hotel's accountant stated that he was acting under the instructions of the general manager, Shen Yongkang. The account books were immediately taken back to the Association, and a lawyer has been engaged to file a lawsuit against Shen Yongkang, the general manager of the hotel, for misappropriation.

Nanshi Issues Additional Severance Rations

The Nanshi refugee area has already been feeling the pinch of financial difficulties, and there has been talk of dismissing the younger and stronger refugees. Since the silent return of the priest some days ago, the situation in the refugee area has become even more tragic. Although there is a Rehabilitation Committee organization to maintain it, refugees in the streets and alleys are all looking worried, because they know that their fate will be even more unimaginable from now on. In recent days, the work of the Rehabilitation Committee has been exceptionally busy, such as preparing a clear list of past income and expenditure and a list of refugees, as well as reviewing how to disperse the staff of the various offices and shelters. Yesterday afternoon at around 1:00 p.m., the Rehabilitation Committee convened a meeting in the area, attended by French Vice-Consul Xie Shibai, Director of the General Office Gu Lun, etc. At that time, it was decided to establish a Dispersal Committee, and all refugees would be dismissed by the end of this month. After this news was formally announced, most of the refugees covered their faces and wept, gathering and refusing to disperse, because they still wanted someone to continue to maintain their lives. Subsequently, the Committee, feeling great sympathy for the plight of the refugees, announced that each refugee would receive half a month's rations for the expiration of the dismissal, and an additional twenty days' worth of grain to maintain their lives during the transition period. The refugees dispersed gratefully.

Ningbo Refugee Donations Designated Collection Points

The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association issued a public notice soliciting donations for rice purchases in Ningbo, stating that recently, the source of Ningbo's grain has been exhausted, and it is in extreme shortage. There is almost no rice available on the market, and the people have no food for the next day. Sweet potato scraps are being sold out. Tragic incidents of grain robberies occur from time to time. People are panicking, and the situation is serious. The Association believes that this matter concerns the safety of their hometown and cannot be ignored. It has been decided to purchase foreign rice to be shipped to Ningbo for sale at low prices to provide relief. The required funds are quite large, and we can only appeal to all members of the community to contribute generously and join in this righteous cause. We also hope that leaders of various industries, philanthropists, and kind-hearted women will persuade others to donate generously to help those in need and ensure the safety of our hometown. The sincere words are presented with urgency. We hope you will take note of the donation collection points: Siming Bank (Beijing Road), Kenye Bank (Beijing Road), Quanggong Bank (Nanjing Road), Fuyuanzhuang (Ningbo Road), Gengyuzhuang (Ningbo Road), and the Accounting Office of the Association. In addition, the second Donation Solicitation Meeting will be held soon, and we have already sent letters to the trade associations, asking them to send representatives to attend on time on the 22nd of this month.

Jewish Refugees Eager to Disperse

According to the French-language Shanghai Daily, according to British sources, the number of Jewish people who have been expelled by the German authorities and have come to Shanghai as refugees has now reached 18,000. The total number of foreigners in the Shanghai concessions is 52,000, of which Japanese people are only 11,000. Therefore, Jewish refugees must be the largest group of foreigners in Shanghai. The most pressing issue to be resolved among the foreigners in Shanghai is the problem of food, clothing, and shelter for Jewish refugees. However, the funds required are enormous, and it is not easy to resolve for the time being. The problem of Jewish employment in Shanghai is also worth studying. However, objectively speaking, it is difficult for Jewish people to compete with local Chinese people, because the living standards of Chinese people are much lower than those of foreigners. According to the intentions of some Jewish people who have come to Shanghai, they are eager to disperse to various places in order to find a place to live and avoid gathering in Shanghai, which would lead to a situation of waiting to die.

### Japanese National Ishimura Robbed and Shot to Death, Died from Bullet Wound to Chest

Ishimura, a Japanese national, 48 years old, worked in the Transportation Department of the Huazhong Industrial Company on Peng Road in this port. Yesterday evening at around 9:00 p.m., Ishimura left the company. When he was walking to a rice shop at the end of Zhoujiazui Road, he suddenly encountered a robber who threatened him with a gun, intending to search for his valuables. Ishimura resisted, but unexpectedly angered the robber, who fired a shot, hitting Ishimura in the vital area of the chest. He fell to the ground and could not get up. Seeing that he had caused trouble, the robber fled without searching for valuables, carrying the gun and disappearing without a trace. When nearby patrolling police officers received the news, they immediately reported it to the Japanese Consulate and the Huishan Police Station. The Huishan Police Station urgently dispatched armed detectives to investigate the scene of the incident. They immediately called for an ambulance to send Ishimura to the Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for treatment. Because the injury was in a vital area, he could not be cured and died.

### Our Newspaper Reporter Mr. Xu Chengxu Passed Away Yesterday Due to Illness: Body at the Shanghai Funeral Home; Encoffining at 4:00 P.M. Today

Mr. Xu Chengxu, a reporter for our newspaper, was talented and virtuous, and he was honest with people. He served in the newspaper for more than ten years, and was diligent and outstanding, which was admired by his colleagues. However, he suddenly contracted typhoid fever a week ago. After several treatments, he did not improve, and unfortunately passed away at 4:00 p.m. yesterday (the 19th). His talent was not fully realized, and we deeply mourn his loss. Mr. Xu's body is scheduled to be encoffined at 4:00 p.m. today (the 20th) at the Shanghai Funeral Home. The details are as follows:

Mr. Xu Chengxu's Last Appearance

Suddenly Afflicted by Illness and Passed Away

Mr. Xu recently devoted himself to calligraphy in addition to reading, collecting rubbings and practicing. He practiced diligently every evening at the newspaper office in his spare time. He mastered almost all the essence of Yan Zhenqing's ancient texts. He was still writing as usual in the newspaper office ten days ago. Unexpectedly, on the 10th of the month, he suddenly felt unwell, but he still managed to come to the newspaper office. Later, because he was too ill to get up, the doctor diagnosed him with typhoid fever, and he began to take leave. He was always loyal and trustworthy to friends who entrusted him with things. The afternoon before yesterday, his illness was already severe, but he still kept in mind a colleague who went to ask him to handle matters on his behalf. At that time, he had already developed a rash from the typhoid fever and was suffering from severe internal heat. The doctors were helpless, and he passed away at his residence at 4:00 p.m. yesterday.

Did Not Manage Property, Impoverished After Death

Mr. Xu and his wife had a deep relationship. His wife is deeply saddened by this misfortune. He left behind two young sons, Chuan'an, 6 years old, and Chuanzheng, 5 years old. His body was moved to the Shanghai Funeral Home on Dallas Evening Road in the evening and is scheduled to be encoffined at 4:00 p.m. today (the 20th). Mr. Xu never managed his property. He liked to associate with dignitaries from all walks of life, helping people in need without hesitation. Therefore, he was particularly impoverished after his death.

Diligent and Competent, Universally Mourned

Mr. Xu's given name was Chengxu, and his alias was Shaoxian. He was from Dantu, Jiangsu Province, and was 41 years old. In his early years, he studied at Zhenjiang Provincial Middle School, where he always ranked at the top of his class and was highly regarded by teachers and classmates. After graduating, he aspired to a career in journalism and co-founded a daily newspaper with a friend in Zhenjiang, which was highly regarded for its fair arguments and accurate news. Later, he accepted an invitation from this newspaper to serve as a foreign reporter. He was diligent and competent, and whenever a major event occurred, his accounts were always detailed and accurate. He served for more than ten years and his reputation grew. Now that he has passed away due to illness, we are deeply saddened.

### Lu Xiaoliang and Dance Hostess Commit Suicide by Poisoning: Both Die Together in a Closed Room in a Hotel

Shen Yanyu (also known as Shen Jinfang), a dance hostess currently working at the Dahua Ballroom, is 20 years old. At the age of four, she was abducted by bandits and sold to a brothel madam named Shen as an adopted daughter. When she grew up, because of her good looks, she was forced to work as a prostitute. Recently, she became inextricably linked with Lu Qiliang (also known as Lu Xiaoliang), a 27-year-old man from Zhejiang who was in the rice and grain business. Because she was unable to buy her freedom and he was already married, the two of them went to Room 65 of the Chuan Jiang No. 3 Hotel on Baliqiao Street in the French Concession on the 15th and stayed together for three nights. They then committed suicide by taking a large dose of opium together on the evening before last (the 18th), emulating the "lovebirds." Yesterday morning (the 19th) at around 10:00 a.m., the tea boy entered the room to check on them and saw that their faces were pale, there was vomit everywhere, and they were barely breathing. He knew that they had taken poison and immediately reported it to the front desk, who reported it to the police. An ambulance was dispatched to take them to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, they had been poisoned too deeply. Lu died on the way, and Shen also gradually died at the hospital. The police sent detectives to investigate and notify their families and sent the two bodies to Tongren Fuyuantang for examination. It was also learned that the deceased was Lu Yaoliang, a native of Taizhou, who had worked as a detective in the French police force for several months before resigning due to an incident. Later, he opened a small shop at 92 Grover Road to do business. He had a wife, but recently, because he became acquainted with a woman named Shen Jinfang, Lu withdrew all the capital from the store, making it impossible to compensate, and took this drastic measure.

### Two-Year-Old Girl Abducted by Bandits While Being Held

Yesterday morning at 10:30 a.m., a kidnapping incident occurred inside 76 Xinjiapo Road in West Shanghai. A local man named Zhu Bingrong, who lives at 25 Lane 545 Connaught Road, runs the Chengtai Plywood Factory. Yesterday, when the incident occurred, Zhu happened to be free and was chatting at a small hotel at 76 Xinjiapo Road while holding his two-year-old daughter, Xinlian. Unexpectedly, two bandits armed with box guns rushed to Zhu's side and warned him not to make a sound. One of the bandits snatched the girl from Zhu's arms and boarded a car that had been waiting nearby, speeding away. After Zhu recovered from the shock, he reported the situation to the police and requested that they track down the bandits.

### Criminals in School Kidnapping and Murder Case Should Be Executed: After Killing Three Children, They Extorted Ransom Money Again; The Criminals' Methods are Extremely Vicious, a True First; The Case Has Been Adjudicated and Sentencing is Scheduled for the 25th

Xiangxi, the nine-year-old son of Mrs. Pan Gu, the housewife of Yunji Fashion Company at 311 Tongfu Road; Yongkang, the nine-year-old son of Mrs. Shen Chen at 282 Lane 5 Tongfu Road; and Changfa, the eleven-year-old son of Mrs. Wang Li at 336 Lane 5 Tongfu Road, were all students at Zhiyi Primary School in Dazhongli, Tongfu Road. On the 11th of last month, at noon, Zhong Bingchu, a partner of Yunji, and Shen, along with his brother Zhong Jianchu and Wang Shengxiang, lured and kidnapped the three children. That night, in the wasteland of the Oriental Library on Baoshan Road in Zhabei,

they died one after another. The criminals also sent letters to the families, demanding a ransom of 50,000 yuan, and obtained 3,000 yuan. The Central Police Department became aware of the matter and arrested the two Zhongs and Wang, along with suspects Liu Bingcheng, Xu Jinxiang, Yao Hexiang, and Wang Shangxian. All were sent to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. Details of the case have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui resumed the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. People from all walks of life attended the hearing, as the kidnappers not only kidnapped the three children, but also killed them that night and then used this to threaten and extort money. Their methods were extremely vicious and their intentions treacherous, truly

unprecedented. First, Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer for the Police Department, prosecuted the two Zhongs and Wang Shengxiang under Article 348 of the Criminal Law for kidnapping and murder, and stated the facts of the case, saying that the Police Department had found that Liu Bingcheng, Xu Jinxiang, Yao Hexiang, and Wang Shangxian were not involved in the case and requested their release. The court approved the release of Liu and the other three. Lawyer Zhang further stated that the defendant Zhong Bingchu had been an apprentice at Yunji Fashion Company, owned by Pan Gentao, for five years, and his brother Jianchu often visited. One day, Jianchu borrowed 14 yuan from Pan and repeatedly failed to repay it. Pan then stated that the amount would have to be deducted from his brother's wages,

leading to resentment and arguments. Jianchu then planned to kidnap Pan's son Xiangxi for ransom. He had repeatedly waited outside Zhiyi Primary School, but there was no opportunity because Pan's child was always escorted to school. On the 11th of last month, at noon, the two Zhongs and Wang went to Dazhongli again and saw that Pan's child was not being escorted after school. They approached him and lured him away under the pretext of watching a circus. Unexpectedly, Wang Changfa and Shen Yongkang also went along. They first went to the circus, but it was late, so they took a tram at the Ma Huo Road intersection to Henan Road, got off, walked to Hongkou, and then took a bus to

Hongkou Park. The three defendants then discussed how to deal with the kidnapping of the three children. They had no place to hide them, and if they released them, the children would recognize them, making it difficult to avoid being caught in the future. They then decided to kill them. They took them to the wasteland of the Oriental Library and killed them one after another. They stripped off their clothes and pawned them, and buried the bodies in the rubble. Afterwards, they sent a letter to the children's families, saying that the children were in good health and that a ransom of 50,000 yuan was required, and arranged a meeting. At that time, the families of the three children were not yet aware that they had been kidnapped, only that they were missing. They had placed

reward advertisements in the newspapers and attached photos. Upon receiving the letter from the kidnappers, they realized they had been kidnapped. They then tried to prepare the ransom to redeem them. They entrusted Gu Rongde to open room 215 at the Oriental Hotel as a meeting place. The defendants then notified them by telephone, instructing them to first send 1,500 yuan, placed in a biscuit tin, to room 40 at the Zhongshan Hotel. Gu delivered the money as instructed. The defendants divided the money, each receiving 500 yuan. Not satisfied, they contacted them again by telephone, asking for another 6,000 yuan to return the children. After several contacts, they were sent another 1,500 yuan. However, Gu believed that the kidnappers had no proof, so he could not simply hand over the money. The kidnappers then

offered evidence, instructing them to send the money to room 33 at the Baxian Hotel, where they could see the evidence before paying. Gu took 1,500 yuan to room 33 at the Baxian Hotel, but the room was empty. He saw a watch on the table, which Gu recognized as belonging to Pan's child. Satisfied, he placed the money under the pillow and left. The money was swallowed by Zhong Jianchu alone and lost in a gambling den in western Shanghai. All the children's clothes have now been retrieved, and the family members and witnesses of the victims have all arrived, said the speaker. Subsequently, the children's mothers successively reported the loss of their children and identified the children's clothes in court. Seeing the items and thinking of their children, they were overcome with emotion,

and tears flowed.

The scene was extremely tragic. Then, Yuan Liangzhuo, a tea server at the Baxian Hotel, and Wang Keshun, a tea server at the Zhong Hotel, testified about the three defendants checking into the rooms. When questioned, the three defendants admitted to luring and kidnapping the three children and strangling them to death. They claimed they were driven by economic hardship and had no other options. After mutual arguments between lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the Police Department and lawyer Tu Huaiqun, who was appointed as the defendants' pro bono counsel, lawyer Zhang stated that the defendants' actions were inhumane and their methods were extremely vicious, deserving the most severe punishment under the law. Prosecutor Tang also argued for a severe sentence. Judge Liu ordered the three defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled sentencing for the 25th.

### Trafficking Opium for Profit: Two Criminals Each Sentenced to Severe Punishment

Xu Amao from Suzhou, who worked as a boatman, was caught by Chinese police officer No. 418 of the Lao Zha Police Department at around 5 AM yesterday morning near the Suzhou River on Zhejiang Road. He had 48 taels of opium hidden on his person, attempting to transport it back to his hometown for sale and profit. He was sent to the First Criminal Division of the Special First Court and prosecuted for trafficking. Judge Feng Shide presided over the hearing. According to the defendant's statement, the opium seized was entrusted to him by Chen Xuecheng, a fugitive opium dealer, to carry out of a Chinese business hostel on Shantou Road and transport it to Suzhou. He only received 25 yuan in transportation fees from Chen. After review by the court, Xu Amao was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for possessing opium with intent to profit, and the opium was confiscated.

Also, Shen Jianghai and Ni Yongfu from Yangzhou were caught by Chinese detectives from the Narcotics Division at 10 PM the day before yesterday, hiding 76 taels of opium in the Zhongshan Hostel on Tianjin Road. They were sent to the Special First Court yesterday, where Judge Feng interrogated them and delivered the verdict in court. The "main text" of the verdict was: Shen Jianghai is sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment for possessing opium with intent to profit, and Ni Yongfu is found not guilty. The seized opium is confiscated.

### Financial Rumors Heavy, Foreign Exchange Demand Exceeds Supply

One rumor said that troops from a certain country had landed in Vietnam, but according to news obtained by this newspaper, the Haiphong authorities had independently blockaded the area to guard against any possible actions by that country. As for the Zhennanguan area, it was rumored to have been occupied by a certain army to enter Annam, which could potentially happen in the future.

After the opening, foreign firms traded American dollars for this month at 5.90625 with HSBC, and the market was quite quiet. The silver equalization tax was announced to increase by 1.25%. Later, a Japanese firm came to the market to buy American dollars for distant months, and the price slightly tightened. It was estimated that foreign firms sold American dollars for July to the Japanese firm at 5.75 to 5.6875. Subsequently, Maccali also had an appetite, and speculators suddenly came to buy, due to rumors of British Prime Minister Churchill's resignation and a certain country's troops landing in Vietnam, leading to an expansion of the buying spree.

### Buying Voices Rise: Gold Market's Rising Trend Intensifies, Highest Price Reaching 5,775 Yuan

Yesterday's black market situation for raw gold continued to rise, with stronger buying sentiment than before, so the rising trend gradually intensified. The tight foreign exchange market made people even more excited. Although the environment was unpredictable, hoarding gold was still the best strategy. Looking at the first half of the day, the morning opening was firm but not high. A certain money exchange firm sold a large amount, causing the price to reach 5,630 yuan. After the opening, it rose several tens of yuan but was thwarted and fell again. Afterwards, the tight trend of foreign exchange was quite good, and buying voices rose in the market, temporarily pushing the price to 5,775 yuan. However, securities firms and cash shops sold in the opposite direction, and the price immediately fell to the 5,700 yuan level. Later, the gold shops held on, and the market closed at 5,740 yuan. As a result, it rose sharply by 150 yuan compared to the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. The transaction volume for half a day was several thousand taels. Jewelry gold shops raised prices by 20 yuan. Customs gold prices remained flat.

Negotiated Peace Rose by 150 Yuan

From the morning, each tael (ten taels), initially, with the foreign exchange market slightly tight, operators had a buying appetite, causing the opening to rise by 40 yuan. A silver shop bought 20 taels from a gold shop for 5,630 yuan. Afterwards, the demand from silver shops, gold shops, and securities firms was very strong. Although at that time, a certain money exchange firm offered a certain amount, the position was still insufficient. In the tightening of the foreign exchange market, the price was ultimately pulled up by another 55 yuan. A gold shop bought 50 taels from a money exchange firm for 5,695 yuan. After this, the foreign exchange market stopped tightening and tended to flatten, and the certain money exchange firm continued to sell, while buyers had gradually decreased slightly, so it fell back by 35 yuan. A silver shop bought 30 taels from a money exchange firm for 5,660 yuan. Then, the foreign exchange market tightened again, due to the widespread rumors in this city that a certain army had landed in Vietnam. But according to the news obtained by this newspaper, the French army in Haiphong had automatically blockaded the area to prevent that country from eyeing it. A buying spree rose again immediately. Silver shops and securities firms scrambled to buy, and before long, a certain money exchange firm also came to cover short positions. Soon, it soared by 115 yuan. A gold shop bought 20 taels from a silver shop for 5,775 yuan. After 11:00, buyers turned scarce, and the bulls from securities firms and silver shop sold high. In addition, at this time, a cash shop sold on behalf of a customer, going back 70 yuan. A securities firm sold 30 taels to a money exchange firm for 5,705 yuan. At noon, a securities firm came back to scoop in, and a gold shop also pulled in. Although a certain silver shop still had a lot to sell, it finally rose by 35 yuan. A silver shop sold 10 taels to a gold shop, closing at 5,740 yuan. As a result, it rose by 150 yuan compared to the previous day. It was firm after the close, and there were few sellers at 5,760 yuan. The fluctuation for half a day was 145 yuan. The cash shop's own brand of gold was sold at a higher price than raw gold by several tens of yuan, and buying in was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and all were done on the opening.

Jewelry Gold Shops Raised Prices by 20 Yuan in a Row

At the beginning, silver jewelry shops quoted the selling price of each tael at 570 yuan, but at 9:30, it was raised by 10 yuan, and at 10:40, it was raised by another 10 yuan. There were no changes after that. As a result, Data Tongheng changed the quotation to 590 yuan. The new stores had the same prices as the previous prices. Buying in was reduced by about 30 yuan.

### The Most Snobbish Manifestation: Only Accepting American Dollars, Refusing to Accept French Francs and Annam Tickets

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, raw gold fluctuated and trended upward, and British and American gold pounds followed suit. The supply and demand for British gold tickets were still balanced, and the market price stood firm. American surplus tickets once rose to 17 yuan and 3 jiao in the morning, and fell back to 17 yuan and 1 jiao 5 fen at noon. In the afternoon, rumors suddenly spread that the British cabinet would be reorganized, and because the foreign exchange market and raw gold had no market on Wednesday, most people changed to buying American gold tickets, so the evening market rose again to 17 yuan and 3 jiao and a half, an increase of 5 jiao and a half compared to the previous day. Hong Kong tickets continued to fall by 1 fen. French francs and Annam tickets were again rejected by money exchange firms, so the market situation was sluggish. There was slightly more demand for Philippine tickets, and the market price rose slightly. The supply and demand for Japanese gold tickets was still balanced, and the evening market was still at 1 yuan and 8 fen. There was still a lack of demand for Korean tickets, and the market price rose slightly, with the evening market at 9 jiao and 5 fen.

### Food: Speculative Rice Merchants Spread Rumors, Foreign Rice Raised to Extraordinarily High Prices

The rice market suddenly recovered from fatigue and tightened in the midday market yesterday, rising uniformly by more than 2 yuan. The weather was fine and sunny, and people's hearts turned firm. If customers in Zhejiang Province and the villages are thinking of coming to handle it cheaply, the buying sentiment suddenly became strong, and the sellers seized the opportunity to turn profitable. The situation was already tight, and general floating hoarding retail investors specializing in speculation also absorbed from it, and at the same time, slightly released the profitable goods in their hands to mutually raise prices. Seeing the prices of various foreign rice rise again and again, the increase has been yuan in the market in an instant. And after the fiercer explosion, all the numbers that had fallen in the previous market were restored. After this, it seemed calm, and there was no recurrence. The result always only lingered between 3 and 5 jiao until the close. The closing prices were: No. 1 aged Saigon 59 yuan and 58.5 yuan, No. 2 57 yuan, No. 1 Siam 58.5 yuan and 58 yuan, No. 2 57 yuan, Fire-refined 58 yuan, Small refined Bank Shop 56.5 yuan, Pudong Shop 56 yuan 2 jiao, 56 yuan, Tokyo pointed 56 yuan, 55 yuan, Rice green 52.5 yuan, 52 yuan. However, due to the extraordinary congestion of new arrivals, and the continued large amount of ordering in later batches, the sales market was smaller than other goods, so it was uniquely without gains or losses. High-quality goods opened at 50 yuan, and then to 48.5 yuan. As for the afternoon, the rumors on the market were even stronger. If shipping was blocked, if there was a landing in Haiphong, and other rumors, they were all beneficial to the buyers. The blind followers bought one after another, the speculators took the opportunity to be active, the new hoarders handled the floating vacancies to buy, and the soccer ball business became more and more lively. The market price was raised higher and higher. And by the time of the evening market, each rice was raised by another 2 yuan. The small pattern Pudong shop was 57.5 yuan, and the bank shop was 58 yuan. Half of the No. 2 Saigon and Siam were 58.5 yuan. After No. 1 West bought opened at 59.5 yuan, it was again shouted to the high price of 60 yuan once seen on the market the day before yesterday. Fire-refined 59 yuan, compared to the previous night's close, all rose by as much as 3 yuan. However, yesterday's surge was really stimulated by rumors. If the rumors are denied by the facts, then its reversal must also be strong. New transactions: a thousand were completed before, small refined 500 tons to be loaded on June 28, priced at 61.5 yuan, Yu and rice merchants, recalled and opened 850 tons, No. Rice 63.5 yuan, and Saigon 62.5 yuan, Broken rice 54 yuan. Now 13,000 bags of foreign rice are opened.

Jing Domestic Rice: Yesterday, more than a thousand bags arrived in total. It is rumored that the black market outside the field for Jing rice, due to the previous decline, has also aroused the handling of each sale, and the price has increased by 2 yuan along with the foreign rice. Always helped special clear Jing 68.5 yuan, 68 yuan, Su Kun Changzhou white Jing special self 68 yuan, decided to reform the overnight heat 66 yuan, Si special thin 67.8 yuan, Nangang early rice 65.6 yuan. Glutinous rice prices were already cheap, the inland destination was strong, and the large households hoarded, so it was even more profitable than other goods. It opened Jinli held yuan 54.5 yuan, Changdan white yuan 53.4 yuan, Jiangbei white yuan 51.2 yuan, with a unique increase of 2 or 3 yuan.

### Flour Market Clearly Fixed, Secretly Strong: New Wheat Is Said to Be Arriving Soon, but There's Still Waiting to Be Done

Flour: Yesterday, the plate of the No. 2 flour factory was still 13 yuan and 8 jiao, and the customer plate was 16 yuan 2 jiao half to 16 yuan 1 jiao. The market remained firm. The current source of new wheat has not yet been smooth, and the raw materials will be lacking. The actual sales in this street have increased due to the high price of rice. In terms of customer sales, the Nanyang gang's removal is also called Lien Chan. Therefore, each factory has gradually become unable to cope. The total transaction volume for each powder in the market is estimated at more than 13,000 bags. The market is clearly fixed and secretly smooth, and it is feared that there may be a realization of an increase in the wholesale price of this street soon. The supply of recalled goods and inland miscellaneous brands of flour is still rare.

Wheat: The source has not yet been smoothed out. Although it is rumored that the new wheat from the Beijing-Shanghai Road and nearby has been transported, according to the current environment, the arrival of goods seems to be smuggling, what is called each showing their divine powers. It is also rumored that a certain factory has received a certain amount and the combined price is a certain amount, which is difficult for those who are not close to a certain party to clarify, but there is no way to verify the father. Therefore, although the new wheat in various places has been listed for a long time, this port is not in a good environment, and it is feared that the peak period of surge still needs to be waited for.

Exports: The types of food transported to foreign ports include flour, 1,000 bags, and beans, 300 bags, transported to Hong Kong.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Is Distressed by Rumors, Foreign Stocks Are Briefly Excited at the End

Securities black market: Yesterday's market situation was again surrounded by unfounded rumors, and the rising trend was thwarted and turned to a decline. As long as the principal and interest are paid on schedule, there is no reason for the debt to shake. Generally, ordinary people disturb themselves, making it difficult for the debt market to raise its head. In the morning, Xinfu was released, Jiufeng sold again, Hongkang covered short positions, and Tongchang Yichang both bought. In the afternoon, Er'e, afternoon, Pianyi Hongda Yichang, and No. 38 all sold in succession, and Lianhe Dayu traded in, but the shorts still occupied the superior labor, and continued to see a slight fatigue. People's hearts were depressed, and the future was not easy to see well. As a result, it fell from a small 1 jiao half to 4 jiao half, and the total number of transactions was about 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock transactions: 75 shares of Dasheng No. 1 Cotton Mill shares were traded, priced at 14 yuan and 9 jiao.

Yesterday's public stock market was very stable, and there were few transactions until the last hour, when there were more buyers due to the tight and smooth exchange market, but soon after, the father turned silent.

London, 18th (Tuesday) Electric: Today's stock market quotations of British Merchants Sudo various companies, the Bank of Hui salt shares re-reported fatigue, British registered shares fell by three pounds, priced at seventy-four pounds, Hong Kong registered shares fell by two pounds, to seventy-eight pounds, and the rest remained unchanged.

London, 18th (Tuesday) Electric: Today's list market of Chinese foreign debts, still reported flat, the top and bottom gears of various bonds were unchanged.

The 1940 dividend of British-run Li Han Automobile Co., Ltd. is scheduled to pay an interim dividend on June 27, at 2 yuan per share in national currency.

### Yarn Flower: Opportunity Machinery Listless, Yarn Market Falling Wind Intensifies: Shuang Ma Saw 1107 Yuan

The yarn market continued to be tired, and the falling wind started again. This is because the European war has changed too much, especially making people's hearts flutter and undecided, so it is difficult for speculators to figure out. But foreign exchange has shrunk again, and gold has risen, but the yarn market has not risen with it. This is because the buying power lacks interest, and at the same time, the actual sales are not as strong as they used to be. In addition, raw materials are cheap, and the hoarders are watching.

The current yarn market opened peacefully in the morning, but there were few buyers in the back market, and at the same time, the Guang gang's purchase of 20-count yarn was rare, and people's hearts were even more frustrated, falling straight to 1,100 yuan. Although the wind of foreign exchange shrinkage started again, the market failed to improve, still to the point of dullness. In fact, speculators suddenly lost interest, the platform was quiet, and the closing price was 1,107 yuan. It was found that the statistics of transactions in half a day, 1,470 bags, the price of 10-count Shuang Ma yarn fell by 39 yuan. Today, 985 pieces of yarn were transported to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each gangkou is listed below:

Same Industry 1,180 Hong Kong 25

Ningbo 13 Mainland 1,470

Fuzhou 4 Statistics 1,470

### Market Observation in the Industry: The Cotton Market is Quiet

Spot cotton transactions, both domestic and foreign, have completely come to a standstill. This is because the world situation is changing so rapidly that it is difficult to grasp, leaving speculators with no way to start. At the same time, the yarn market is depressed and overseas cotton markets are trending downwards, making price increases difficult. Therefore, operators are mostly taking a wait-and-see approach.

In other news, in the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market initially fell slightly due to selling pressure in the morning. Later, due to public buying and the covering of short positions by some speculators, the market recovered and strengthened. As a result, the closing price rose by thirteen to fourteen points compared to today. The Indian market was also relatively stable, rising by three rupees yesterday, including forecasts.

Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions have been particularly sluggish in recent days. Transactions from all parties are quiet, all waiting for news from Europe. However, market sentiment is quite good. The factory delivery prices of yesterday's cotton market, converted at a US dollar exchange rate of 5.8125 yuan, are as follows:

20 count American Mid-lin: 300.500

Also, Lower Grade: 291.00

32 count, Again: 310.90

Also, Lower Grade: 300.60

42 count, Again: 112.50

Also, Lower Grade: 112.40

### Coal: White Coal Arrives Steadily in Shanghai

Foreign coal such as Hongay and Tongdeli white coal, produced in French Hongay, Annam, is unaffected by the European war. Shipping routes are still operating as usual, and new supplies are arriving steadily in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Manchester ship brought over 2,400 tons of Hongay white coal from that area, which has already arrived in port and is being unloaded at Yangjingbang. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the source of foreign coal being cut off.

### Silk and Tea: Japanese and American Silk Prices Decline, Shanghai Silk Merchants Hoard Goods

Yesterday, the American silk market declined. Near-term prices in New York fell by 5 cents, and long-term prices fell by 5.5 cents. Yokohama spot prices fell by 15 yuan, and long-term prices fell by 23 yuan. Foreign firms' buying prices also fell accordingly. Because the future of the European war is still uncertain, the market atmosphere is inevitably showing a wait-and-see attitude.

In Shanghai's silk market, because there is still no definite solution to the export problem, silk from the interior is currently blocked. It is said that the new "donation" is valued at 12% of the draw, and will be levied in early July. However, there is no concrete news. Therefore, merchants are hoarding goods, and most silk merchants are unwilling to sell easily. Yesterday, the buying price for Chefoo silk was 2,150 yuan, but no transactions were heard.

### Foreign Firms' Tea Sales Plummet

Green tea from foreign firms in Shanghai has seen a plunge because the cost has increased several times compared to the past due to increased exorbitant taxes and levies on sources from the interior, and the European situation is becoming increasingly tense. Telegrams of discontinued orders are arriving one after another from abroad, resulting in a slump in the market. Yesterday, only Harmony and Jardine and other firms purchased more than 70 cases of Chun Mee green tea, with prices ranging from 260 yuan to 275 yuan, a decrease of more than 10 yuan compared to the previous price. Currently, only one or two dozen of the city's hundred or so tea factories are勉力 producing goods.

In addition, 190 packages of tea arrived from Ningbo yesterday, and 300 packages were transported to Hong Kong today.

### Piece Goods: Unrest in the South China Sea Affects Cloth Sales

Cloth sales in the southwest are affected by the suspension of the sea defense and Hong Kong lines, and rumors of Japan's invasion of Liangshan. However, the sharp contraction of foreign exchange is also a positive factor, so people are apprehensive, and transactions among peers have suddenly decreased. Stockpilers also have little interest, resulting in a slight drop in some cloth prices by 0.35 to 0.5 yuan per piece. However, due to exchange rate relations, exports have increased slightly. At the same time, domestic sales in various regions have also made slight progress. Wholesale shops on this street purchased more than 6,000 pieces of government cloth, foreign yarn, bleached cloth, and grey cloth. Zhejiang and Anhui merchants also purchased 4,000 to 5,000 pieces. Guangdong merchants purchased 100-plus items of colored cloth and fine cloth. Tianjin merchants purchased 100-plus boxes of blue cloth and Shilin cloth. Merchants from Siam, Singapore, and other foreign countries purchased 7,000 to 8,000 pieces of government cloth and various bleached and dyed cloths. Hong Kong merchants purchased 2,000-plus pieces of twill, bleached cloth, and government cloth. On the 20th, 82 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.

Sales of eastern cloth are still sluggish as before. Speculators are still inclined to sell, resulting in the market becoming increasingly depressed. Longtou fine cloth opened in the morning at 34 yuan per piece, but fell to 33.45 yuan. Four Gentlemen serge fell from 0.89 yuan to 0.8825 yuan per yard. At the close, the situation for serge was stronger, returning to 0.8875 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Raw White Sugar Rises

Yesterday, the sugar market trended upward with more buying interest. The association's盘开, spot prices for No. 24 raw white sugar at the warehouse were 70.5 yuan in the morning and 71 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of one yuan. Prices at external warehouses were 69.6 yuan to 70 yuan, and 0.2 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 0.4 yuan. Re-exported goods initially traded at 55.1 yuan, gradually rising to 0.5 yuan, and then further to 0.7 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 0.7 yuan. Taikoo granulated white sugar B mark was 80.5 yuan, unchanged. Dutch red sugar was 59.5 yuan, up角. 本厂雪白 sugar was 70 yuan, up 0.5 yuan. No changes were seen in No. 1 crystal sugar and bright crystal sugar. A ship from the Chaozhou帮 opened with 120 packages of Zhangzhou Qing刁　, at 62 yuan.

### Metals: White Lead Sheet Market Listless

The white lead sheet market, which has been sluggish for a long time, still showed no improvement yesterday. Merchants from Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao and other帮 were rarely purchasing, and transactions from battery factories on this street were also small. Currently, transactions in the market rely only on the 门庄隅, resulting in a bleak market and weak sentiment. At present, except for No. 6 and No. 16, which are slightly firm due to a shortage of goods in the market, the rest have all declined.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Still Weak, Raw Oil Mixed

The underlying trend of soybean oil remains weak. In short, sales are not sustained and sources are plentiful, making manipulation impossible. Therefore, the narrow situation is difficult to develop. Yesterday, only ten barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded, priced at 98 yuan, a further drop of 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day. 100 pieces of Yantai Qiqi soybean oil were traded at the original price of 70 yuan (听说 taxes are levied on oil transferred from Hongkou), and 100 groups of Dayou factory soybean oil were traded at 75 yuan. Peanut oil was mixed, mostly depending on the sluggish sales situation. Yesterday, the Hong Kong帮 continued to purchase 100 barrels of Jiangbei 本坊 oil at a price of 100 yuan. The street settled 200 barrels of Yantai oil at 90 yuan, and 10 barrels of Jiangbei 门庄油 at 94.5 yuan.

Rehashing Old News: Sixty-Seven Years Ago (420) (See this newspaper from the Twelfth Year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty)

### The Origins of Rebuilding Jing'an Temple

Jing'an Temple in Shanghai was built during the Sun-Wu period and was originally named Chongyuan Temple. It was later renamed Yongtai Chan Monastery, and the name was changed to its current name during the Xiangfu period of the Song Dynasty. Zhou Bi of the Yuan Dynasty wrote in a brief account: "In the first year of the Jianxing period of the Jin Dynasty, there were two stone Buddhas floating in the estuary of the Wusong River. Fishermen then found two stone bowls on the sand, which were all enshrined in the temple, and were quite spiritually responsive." It has been repeatedly destroyed by war, and the stone Buddha was once moved to Wumen. It is unknown whether it still exists. The temple has scenic spots such as the Red Crow Stele, the Chan Dynasty Juniper Scripture Lecture Platform, the Shrimp Pond, the Yongquan Spring, and the Green Cloud Cave. It has been repaired and collapsed repeatedly from the Yuan and Ming dynasties to the Qing Dynasty. In the late Xianfeng period, the four suburbs were full of fortresses, making it even more unbearable. Later, the monk Hefeng wanted to rebuild it, but was unable to continue due to insufficient donations and conflicts with the engineer. Only wood was prepared, and then a major famine occurred in the Northwest Province. Good people emptied their pockets to help with disaster relief, prioritizing what was urgent. Now, the villagers and monks of the temple are requesting to complete the unfinished work. However, the project is large, and it depends on the maintenance of the public. They are recounting the beginning and end of the temple construction, as well as the reasons for the suspension of the work in recent years, in order to broaden good relationships and demonstrate public trust, so that the temple, which has been over a thousand years old, will be rebuilt, and the public virtue of all donors will be immeasurable.

### Misdirected Libelous Letter

A sealed letter from the Su Yuan Letter Bureau was delivered to the County Magistrate's Office. It was signed Zuo Liangcai, and it contained accusations against officialdom. The County Magistrate was furious after reading it! He immediately ordered all prefectures and counties to instruct the Letter Bureau that all letters to government offices must first verify the origin before being delivered.

### Death Rays Are Not to Be Feared

— New Nan

After the outbreak of the European war, everyone expected the belligerent countries to use some kind of civilized (?) weapons to fight. The fact is, the German army continued to use several new weapons - electromagnetic mines, flamethrower armored vehicles, etc. Hitler, while using new weapons to fight, also threatened to use another new weapon; so everyone thought back to the long-heard but not-yet-used "death ray."

"Death ray" is said to be a kind of short-wave light, the light wave of which is even shorter than X-rays; because it is known from theory that the shorter the light wave, the greater the energy it contains, that is, the greater the destructive power to the body when it is shot on the body. We know that X-rays must be taken by a doctor: on the one hand, because only doctors can use X-rays to check for defects in the body; on the other hand, because the time of X-ray irradiation is closely related to the physique. In other words: X-rays cannot be irradiated on the human body for too long, otherwise there will be unexpected damage, especially to the eyes. X-rays with longer light waves are still like this, let alone "death rays" with much shorter light waves?

"Death ray" is still a mystery, so the theory, although it seems possible, but whether there is currently a machine that can emit "death ray" is indeed a question. So some people say that this is impossible, it is the boasting of idiots. In fact, there is no need to be like this, because according to leaked news, German scientists have indeed invented a kind of light, and have used it to kill a mouse, it is said that the result is very satisfactory; but we do not know whether this kind of light has been tried on humans, whether on-site experiments have been done in front of thousands of people. Maybe it can only kill small animals and not people, maybe it can only kill one or two people and not thousands of people.

According to recent news from the United States, the German "death ray" can only make people temporarily comatose, not kill people, so it is a very humane "weapon". In fact, since it is a "weapon", there is no distinction between humane and inhumane at all; unless the shells fired are bread, the bullets are candy, and the "death ray" is a lighting product. But then again, although "death ray" is inhumane, it is certainly not very scary in fact: to use X-rays indoors to specifically examine a person's body costs more than ten yuan in Shanghai, and the effectiveness of using it aimlessly on the battlefield will certainly be much reduced; so I think that using "death ray" to kill thousands of people, the consumption must also be very large. At the same time, when attacking, emitting "death ray" will probably inevitably not affect the food left by the enemy - whether animal or vegetable. So the attacking army has to carry a lot of food with them. So wanting to use "death ray" to step up the attack is actually probably difficult to achieve. Therefore, now we do not discuss whether "death ray" has been invented, we always think that even if there is "death ray", its ability must be limited and not to be feared.

### Drought

— Zhuo

Eating rice at fifty or sixty yuan a担 in Shanghai is the work of rice weevils. The hometown, which is known for producing rice, has recently seen the price of rice also rise to more than fifty yuan a 担, which makes me feel a little strange. When I received a letter, I suddenly understood. The letter said: "Recently, the price of rice in my hometown has risen sharply to fifty-three yuan a 担. This price is probably about the same as in Shanghai, right? And it hasn't rained for more than two months. The water in the river is so shallow that the bottom can be seen. Early rice cannot be transplanted because there is no water. If it doesn't rain again, a terrible drought will come."

In the previous letter, it was also mentioned that the river channels were blocked by obstacles. ×× people, in order to prevent guerrillas, built small fences in every river channel. The water in the river cannot flow, and farmers cannot draw water. Moreover, the seasonal epidemics in the summer are expected to be particularly rampant. If it doesn't rain heavily in the next few days, the drought will definitely succeed. But in Jiangnan, which has already suffered enough from man-made disasters, how can it cope with natural disasters!

So, I think of rain, hoping for heavy rain.

When I got up in the morning, the sky was full of dark clouds, and there was a drizzle. I hoped it would rain heavily, the heavier the better. But this was just hope, and the sky slowly cleared up, and there was no more drizzle. When I went out in the morning to prepare to do my monotonous work, I wanted it to rain, so that I could feel some joy after the inconvenience of the journey to and from work, which I often recognized as suffering, but I was disappointed. The food stalls by the roadside were also talking about this, hoping for rain, and willing to lose their business. So I felt that my little sacrifice of inconvenience in walking was insignificant.

I looked at the fire, looking at the white clouds in the sky that were about to rain but not raining, I hoped it would rain, let those food stalls temporarily lose their business, and let me get some joy after the inconvenience of walking, which I felt was suffering!

But the rich young masters and ladies living in the midst of bright lights and fine wines do not feel those things.

Hawthorne Detective Cases

### The Ballerina's End

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Two "A Page of History!"

Hawthorne slowly asked: "When did you know that she was dancing?"

The old man thought for a while and said, "In the autumn of the year before last, she wrote a letter to the countryside and sent me fifty yuan, asking me to come to Shanghai for a visit. When I arrived here, I found out that as soon as she arrived in Shanghai, she didn't go to any factory, but followed Zhaodi to learn to dance. Zhaodi was also a dancer. Telling us she was working was just a lie to us country people. At that time, Lilan had just turned twenty and was selected as the dancing queen. A group of frivolous teenagers in Shanghai were crazy about her. She was so happy that she specially asked me to come to Shanghai for a visit."

Hawthorne said: "Have you been here from that time until now?"

Li Zhiban shook his head. "No, I'm not used to this kind of life - maybe I don't have the luck. After staying for ten days, I went back to the countryside. This time she wrote another letter asking me to come to Shanghai. I still arrived on the 11th and it has been eight days today. The house here is much bigger than before, and her scene is much wider, but I'm still not used to it. I originally planned to go back to the countryside in another two or three days, but who would have thought that this would happen last night."

Hawthorne nodded, thought for a while, and said, "Now, please tell me what happened last night."

Li Zhiban said: "I don't quite understand either. Lilan had dinner outside last night - in fact, this time I have been here for eight days, and she only had dinner with me at home once. After I ate dinner alone, I read a newspaper in this room, and then flipped through those picture books. Around ten o'clock, it rained, so I went upstairs to sleep - alas, I forgot my pipe here." (Twenty)

### Life: The True Meaning of Life

— Zhang Jun

Many young people often say this: "We are really born at the wrong time. If we were born earlier, the country might be more peaceful, and we could enjoy the blessings of working at sunrise and resting at sunset; if we were born later, the country might have already completed its nation-building, and we could enjoy the blessings of the people ruling, owning, and enjoying the Three People's Principles. But, young people; maybe you will enjoy the blessings, but the true meaning of life will also be reduced at the same time."

What is the true meaning of life? Simply put, it is "creation" and "struggle". All the environments of enjoying blessings are most likely to reduce the ability to create and the mood to struggle. In an ordinary and unremarkable environment, you can't do anything earth-shattering or touching. What is the true meaning of passing your life in vain?

The most frustrating thing in life is having nothing to do; or having something to do, but it is too ordinary and has no value. People who love mathematics will understand that practicing familiar problems that you already understand all day long will definitely make you feel bored; if you suddenly encounter a complex problem and solve it after hard thinking, you will definitely be very happy and joyful.

### Sketches of the Tang Family Trio

— A Han

In the history of Chinese drama, the China Traveling Theatre Company is indeed very meritorious. The Tang family trio of the China Traveling Theatre Company, Huaiqiu, Ruoqing, and Ruoying, have the largest number of audience members. Here is a brief sketch of the father and daughters:

Tang Huaiqiu's attitude towards theatrical work is serious and faithful. The lead role in the recent film "Confucius" is enough to prove this. He used to work with his father, Mr. Dixin, in his hometown of Hunan, and used his spare time to compile a副刊, write essays and short pieces, so he is also a literary writer! He studied aviation in France in his early years, but after returning to China, he engaged in the drama movement. He is already forty-three years old this year. The tone of his speech is a little old, and his figure and face are both slender. He and his wife and two daughters often use humorous dynamics to unfold the joy of family life. For example, if he wants to talk to his daughter, he doesn't talk to her face to face, but writes on a piece of paper, with the words "Dad" signed below. Just looking at this matter is very funny. Recently, the three of them, father and daughters, jointly starred in "Thunderstorm". Because Ruoqing temporarily participated in it beforehand, the box office broke the historical record of the璇宫. He sighed and said, "I'm old, I'm useless, my audience has been drawn in by Ruoqing!" In fact, his heart is full of unspeakable joy!

Tang Ruoqing... When she returned from Hong Kong, she said: "A comfortable life has made my body fatter!" It can be seen that she is a new woman with healthy beauty. Her personality is woven with enthusiasm and boldness. Regardless of whether she knows people or not, her attitude always gives people a beautiful impression. She said: "Besides reading newspapers, I have no other hobbies. But if I have to mention one, it might be "义义 小麻将"." However, her stage art is indeed unmatched, but her mahjong skills are very childish, and she often draws eighteen tiles. She herself considers this to be the only joke.

Tang Ruoying... Innocent and lively, can describe her entire nature. She is currently studying literature at Aurora University. In her spare time, she often performs as a guest star. In "Thunderstorm", she plays Sifeng, which is very in line with her personality. At home, she raises many puppies, kittens, chicks, and ducklings, and plants melons, fruits, and other things. She said: "Her confidant companions are these small animals and small plants."

### Royal Palace Theater to Be Converted into MGM Ballroom

— Leng Bai

The Royal Palace Theater, which opened this year, failed due to the performance of the Kui Deshe troupe, so it once planned to be converted into a cinema to screen second-run domestic films. Later, however, it had to be abandoned due to licensing issues. At the same time, it was rented to Fulu Shou Company, which came forward to perform Shenqu operas by the Wen Bin troupe. Now that the contract of the Wen Bin troupe will expire at the end of this month, the reporter has learned from reliable sources about the future direction of the theater.

The mainstays of the Royal Palace are Mr. He Wuliang and Mr. Zheng Wei Xian. Mr. Zheng is the manager of the Da Xin Ballroom. The monthly rent of Da Xin is 3,000 yuan, but recently it is going to increase by 3,500 yuan, for a total of 6,500 yuan. Therefore, Mr. Zheng discussed with Mr. He and decided to abandon Da Xin, convert the Royal Palace into a ballroom, and name it MGM. It is scheduled to start construction in early July and open on October 1st.

Originally, the site of the Royal Palace was the donkey racecourse of the New World. The donkey racecourse was moved to the south. Now, in order to expand the site, MGM has decided to cancel the donkey racecourse in the south again and include it in MGM's vision. Fortunately, Mr. Zheng is also the manager of the New World, so there is no problem.

### Competing to Shoot Folk Movies is Ultimately Not a Blessing for the Film Industry

— Yi Xing

In the past half month, the company's preparations for competing to shoot folk story films have suddenly become very tense. This is a major change in the Chinese film industry, and it may as well be called a re-enactment of the history of Chinese films fifteen years ago. Its impact on film culture cannot be ignored. The reporter specially interviewed a prominent figure in the film culture circle who is currently retired to inquire about his opinions. The gentleman replied frankly: "Before criticizing the competition to shoot folk movies, I think we must first answer a question: Is it necessary for production companies to exist in Shanghai today? If it is necessary to exist in Shanghai today, the central government should send personnel to directly guide them. Otherwise, let them live and decline on their own, although there is no guarantee that this phenomenon will not occur. This is not only the case for film companies, but for all commercial combinations, this is possible." When talking about various companies competing to shoot folk stories, the gentleman replied: "I think that even if the current environment is not good, the path of production will never be so narrow. If you don't take this path, it doesn't mean there are no other paths to take. However, the fact that producers are competing to take this path certainly has his reasons: either for the convenience of production, or for ease of attracting audiences. If these two reasons outweigh everything else, then we have nothing to say."

### Random Notes from Silver Screen

— Star

"Guanyin" Filming Completed: Yihua considers its most expensive production of the year, "Guanyin," to be entirely completed. It is rumored that the first round of screening rights have been obtained by Heguang, but Xinguang believes that Yihua has a contract with their theater and cannot give up, so they are also vying for the premiere rights.

"Xi Shi" to be Previewed Today: Xinhua Company's film "Xi Shi" has taken nearly a year to produce. Zhang Shankun's emphasis on this film surpasses even "Diao Chan" and "Mulan Joins the Army." It is now largely completed and scheduled for a secret preview today. Besides director Bu Wancang and a few others, only one or two Nanyang film merchants are allowed to attend.

Golden Star's Debut: Golden Star Company has leased the Guohua New Studio, starting from June 15th. The first film will officially begin shooting on July 1st, directed by Wu Cun. The Golden Star authorities are unwilling to reveal the film's name, but the person in charge of Golden Star stated that it is definitely not being kept secret due to being a similar production to another company.

The Shanghai YWCA plans to hold a one-day broadcast fundraising event at the Xindu Glass Radio Station for the construction of dormitories. Students from various girls' schools in Shanghai will broadcast, and movie stars Chen Yunshang and Gu Lanjun, as well as theater actresses Tang Ruoqing and Tang Ruoying, have been invited to participate, with famous amateur opera singer Jiang Yiqiu in charge of the arrangements.
