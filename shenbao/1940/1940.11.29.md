However, after the meeting, officials stated that no new loans to China were discussed. Treasury officials also said they had not heard of the rumored new loan.

Chairman Jones stated that talks with the Chinese side are ongoing, and the Chinese side has expressed its desire to obtain "more loans."

### Northern Chinese Troops in Sui County Triumphantly Return; Recover Lishan and Jingmingpu; Japanese Troops at Jinji Ridge Retreat Southward; Chinese Corps Surround Japanese Troops

Fancheng - The Japanese on the Xianghua Road front in northern Hubei again circled around to Jingmingpu, where they were annihilated by the Chinese army. On the 26th, the Chinese army captured Jingmingpu, and then took advantage of the victory to continue to capture Kuaihuoling. At dawn on the 27th, the Chinese attacked the vicinity of Lishan, and the Japanese were again defeated by the Chinese. At 3:00 PM, Lishan was recovered, and the Japanese at Jinji Ridge also retreated southward. Currently, the Chinese armies are encircling the defeated Japanese for a painful strike. The Japanese, under attack from both the front and rear, were unable to withstand the retreat. (Dispatch of the 28th)

Zaoyang - The Japanese who invaded the western foot of Dabong Mountain from the vicinity of Zhongxiang were severely damaged by the Chinese army near Changshou Store. The Japanese repeatedly reinforced and attacked fiercely but were bravely repelled by the Chinese army. As of the morning of the 27th, the fighting was still ongoing. (Dispatch of the 28th)

Chongqing - A spokesperson for the Chinese army recently told the press that the extensive offensive of the Japanese army in Hubei Province is merely to drive its air force to attack the locations of a small number of Chinese troops, in order to reduce China's military strength and equipment, and to occupy places from time to time. The spokesperson said that the Japanese army does not currently want to launch a major general offensive in an attempt to occupy new land, as this tactic requires a large amount of manpower and financial resources, which the Japanese army may not have at this time. In the recent battles in Hubei Province, the Japanese army cannot hope to gain anything, because at this time the Japanese army only has one or two divisions to deal with a 150-kilometer front line. The spokesperson pointed out that the Japanese army is currently acting in the same way as they previously occupied Shaoxing and Zhuji, and the result will definitely not be beneficial. The current attack by the Japanese army is the third attempt by the Japanese army in Hubei Province since the start of the war, but the previous two attacks used no less than five divisions of troops, and their momentum was far more terrifying than the current attack. Since the first two have failed, this one will undoubtedly fail as well. The spokesperson also said that the Japanese army launched a fierce attack from Sui County in northern Hubei towards Lishan on Monday, but was driven back to Kuihe Ridge (transliteration) west of Sui County the next day. Another Japanese team attacked north from the area between Yichang and Dangyang but was blocked at Lexiangguan near Dangyang. The Japanese troops who invaded the east bank of the Hanshui River from Zhongxiang were also repelled. The Chinese army had a good harvest in the previous week, recovering Mengcheng in northern Anhui on November 19th, and recovering Zhizhi at the junction of Anhui and Jiangxi last night. In North China, there have also been fierce battles in Jin Province since November 10th.

Editorial

### What Will America Do?

The remarks made by US Secretary of State Hull and others after Japan appointed former Foreign Minister Admiral Nomura Kichisaburo as ambassador to the United States, such as saying that everyone knows the US position in advocating that international relations should be based on law; and that Nomura must be able to ensure that Japan's policy in China does not contradict his statement that all countries in the East must continue to have free and unrestricted exchanges with other countries; and that Japan's actions speak louder than its words, hitting people's eardrums; and that if Japan wants to improve its relationship with the United States, it must fundamentally change its policies, and merely changing the ambassador to the United States will not help; these views are sufficient to prove that the United States has a thorough understanding of the Sino-Japanese problem and a firm and stable Far East policy. At the same time, although Chinese Ambassador to the United States Hu Shi and President of the Bank of China Song Ziwen kept the contents of their meeting with Hull yesterday secret, according to Jones, Chairman of the US Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the United States is considering providing more assistance to China. The more difficult China's situation becomes, the more we hope to do everything in our power to help. He also said that China's desire to obtain more assistance is gaining a favorable response in the United States because the previous transactions between China and the United States were extremely satisfactory. Comparing the attitudes of the United States towards China and Japan, we can see that although the future of the Pacific is cloudy, it is also in the midst of a battle between light and darkness. This is further evidenced by the opinions in Tokyo that Nomura should be encouraged, all of which say that US-Japan relations are extremely bad and Nomura's mission is extremely difficult, indicating that the Japanese are outwardly strong but inwardly weak and not very confident.

Among the above, although we feel that there are reassuring elements that are helpful to the overall situation, it is not enough to accelerate its effectiveness in curbing aggression and stabilizing the Far East. As early as fourteen months ago, the Japanese authorities were eager to adjust Japanese-American relations, so they scouted for Nomura, who "had studied at the US Naval Academy, served as a naval attache at the US Embassy in the United States, and was one of the Japanese representatives at the Washington Conference, and knew many people in the US government and public," to be the Foreign Minister. They thought that he would be able to deal with the United States. At that time, we once pointed out that "the crux of the US is the fundamental contradiction of national policy; that is, the United States is committed to maintaining the civilized principles of mankind, maintaining the principles of international justice, and maintaining the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty, while Japan is destroying what the United States wants to maintain by force. The contradiction goes beyond diplomacy and lies in the realm of politics, which cannot be eliminated by the talents of the Foreign Minister; to say that the traditional national policy of a foreign country will be changed by the talents of the Foreign Minister is absolutely impossible, so how can Nomura adjust it? To adjust the US-Japan situation, Japan must give up its aggression, otherwise all efforts will be in vain; observing that the Japanese leaders do not correct their own actions but only blame the Foreign Minister, it can be seen that the Japanese leaders have failed to understand the crux of the matter." Nomura ultimately achieved nothing and resigned in frustration. More than a year has passed, and one can no longer imagine that the Japanese government and public have not seen through the crux of the US-Japan situation; therefore, Japan initially had high expectations for Nomura's tenure as Foreign Minister, but now the encouragement for him to be the US envoy is no longer the same. It can be seen that Japan's attitude towards the United States is, on the one hand, to do its best regardless of success or failure, without expecting anything; on the other hand, to maintain the formal normality of diplomatic relations with the United States, not to keep the envoys away, but to deceive the eyes and ears and cover up other activities, in order to gain time and space that are beneficial to itself. What the United States has expressed about Nomura's mission to the United States is completely consistent with what we discussed fourteen months ago: it is sufficient to show that the crux of the matter remains the same, and it also shows that although the US attitude is extremely firm and has made Japan aware of US assessment, it has still failed to effectively correct the phenomenon of the past year. This is something that anyone cannot help but feel is not enough. As for US aid to China, Jones's words are extremely far-reaching; and the meeting between the Chinese Hu and Song and Hull was certainly not just empty talk. The contents of the contact are naturally not clear to outsiders, but judging from the signs alone, the United States is extremely satisfied with its dealings with China, as Jones said. As for the United States' aid to Britain, as George, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in yesterday's Reuters Washington dispatch, any move to expand financial assistance must first have an investigation into British resources; originally, any assistance must have its corresponding value, but given the current international situation and its chaotic nature, the United States' aid to China and Britain is based only on the satisfaction of transactions and the investigation of resources as the basis for consideration, and such a scope of consideration must also be felt by anyone to be insufficient. Japan did not interrupt its oppression because the United States advocated maintaining the status quo in Vietnam, and finally signed the Vietnam Agreement with the French, acquiring Hanoi and Haiphong as bases. The past is not far away and can serve as a warning, and according to last night's news, the French made a deeper step of humiliating compromise, and Vichy directly allowed Japan to open a Japanese air base in Saigon. One leap after another, advancing south and then south, Saigon is another thousand miles south of Hanoi and Haiphong. Is this ultimately to deal with China and get closer to the Yunnan-Burma Road? It goes against the grain, geographically not at all. The Japanese have already taken advantage of the weakest link in the international community, advancing fiercely along the French Vietnamese coast, and now they have detoured and circled to the southwest of the Philippines. From Saigon, only 650 miles remain from the Singapore naval base operated by Britain and borrowed by the United States! How should American officials address these serious phenomena, based on a firm policy? Reconsider its actions and take effective measures as soon as possible?

### Japan Establishes Air Base in Saigon; Has Obtained Permission from Vichy Government; Japanese Aircraft Constantly Fly Over Hanoi

If the other side uses a peaceful negotiation method, Vichy is also happy to discuss Thailand's demands with Thailand. It is said that the number of reserve troops in French Vietnam is quite large, enough to defend the integrity of the territory, but the Thai air force has a significant advantage because it recently received many American aircraft. The French government still hopes that Thailand will ratify the mutual non-aggression treaty agreed upon by France and Thailand on June 12. (United Press dispatch, 28th)

Hanoi - French authorities recently stated that the indigenous unrest in southern Vietnam was stabilized the week before last, but unrest has broken out in northern Vietnam again.

### Jiang Jieshi Attends to Sichuan Province Rice Shortage; Orders County Magistrates to Quickly Devise Solutions

Chongqing: Local newspapers recently reported that Chairman Jiang has instructed the twenty county magistrates of Sichuan Province to quickly assist in resolving the rice panic. He instructed the county magistrates to inform local landlords and wealthy families that it is their natural duty to supply rice to the people and the military at fair prices. If landlords and others object, the county magistrates should directly report the names of five or ten hoarders within ten days, and then take appropriate measures to deal with them. Reports state that areas in the western region with abundant rice production, such as Chengdu, are also reluctant to supply rice to the military. According to the Ta Kung Pao, the price of rice in Chengdu has fallen below 100 yuan per dan (unit of weight), and further declines are expected. The price of rice in Chongqing has fallen from 180 yuan per dan to 135 yuan per dan during this period. Authoritative sources also stated that there is no shortage of production at present, and the rise in rice prices is purely due to speculation. As the cost of living increases, so will labor costs. Last winter, the price of rice consumed by each person per day was only five jiao (unit of currency), but now it costs two yuan per person per day. (United Press dispatch, 28th)

### Japan Purchases Military Supplies and Raw Materials in Hong Kong; Tungsten and Gallnuts Purchased in Large Quantities; Hong Kong Government Does Not Prohibit Shipment to Japan

Hong Kong: Since the United States embargoed scrap iron and other war materials, Japan has been purchasing large quantities of tungsten sand, scrap iron, and gallnuts in Hong Kong. Gallnuts are an essential raw material for the manufacture of incendiary bombs, and their prices are also lower than in other parts of the world. Japanese merchants are now eagerly stockpiling tungsten sand, preparing to use it to manufacture heavy military equipment in Japan. The export of tungsten is currently controlled by the Hong Kong government, fearing that it will be shipped to Germany, but does not prohibit its shipment to Japan, and then re-shipped to Germany, because Japan needs all of Hong Kong's tungsten and cannot transfer it to Germany. Although the Chongqing authorities prohibit the export of tungsten, a large amount of tungsten sand is still smuggled from Guangdong Province, which is occupied by Japan, to Hong Kong. Smugglers pay considerable protection fees in the occupied areas and can transport it to Hong Kong Island. The Beijiang, Dongjiang, Xijiang, and southern Jiangxi Province on the border of Guangdong Province are all tungsten-producing areas. All tungsten sand must be transported to Hong Kong Island and then shipped to various parts of the world. The United States often purchases tungsten sand from the Chinese government, paying for it to repay credit loans. Another major customer for tungsten is the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union exchanges military equipment and warplanes for China's tungsten sand. Now Japan is sharing a portion of the tungsten from Guangdong, which is due to the smugglers. Trade between Japan and Hong Kong is booming because Japanese goods are cheap and suitable for use in the interior. Theoretically, Japan does not sell its goods to Free China, but this is only a paper prohibition. Japanese goods are first stripped of their labels in Shanghai and Hong Kong and then transported from Shandong. A portion of the Japanese goods is routed through Shau Kei Wan, and most are routed through Lubao to Shaoguan. Another portion of Japanese goods is transported to Shantou and smuggled to the Dongjiang area, north to northern Guangdong and southern Jiangxi. Although general business in Hong Kong is currently declining, Japanese exporters and importers of Japanese goods are making ten times their profits. (International News Agency dispatch, 28th)

### Greek Army Advances on All Sides; Italian Troops Fight to the Death in Albanian Territory; Greek Army Swiftly Advances Using Mobile Warfare Tactics

Athens: The General Headquarters recently issued a war report stating that our army has adopted mobile warfare tactics today and is making rapid progress. Although the enemy is still resisting stubbornly near the city of Pogradec, they have been defeated by our army. Their reinforcements also failed to reach their designated locations due to being bombed by the British Air Force. In summary, our military operations within Albanian territory are extremely successful. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

Southern Capital: According to news received here, the Italian army on the Albanian front has begun a counter-offensive against the Greek positions near Hasan Kert, south of Korce. The Italian artillery has concentrated west of Korce, and the total Italian counter-offensive is clearly in preparation. Air raids on all fronts will become more intense after the weather improves. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

Southern Ohrid Lake Bank, Struga: Yesterday, the perilous situation of the Italian army in Albania increased every hour. The Greek army advanced on all sides. The Italian army's resistance seemed more organized than before, leading to widespread rumors that the Italian commander General Badoglio had established a general headquarters in Tirana, the capital of Albania. This is sufficient to indicate the desperate position of the Italian army. In the town of Moscopole, the Italian army launched two strong counter-offensives, but after an hour of fierce fighting, they were both repelled by the Greek army. From Pogradec to the Kavala Sein road, British planes dropped bombs all day yesterday, killing and wounding many Italian soldiers. The Greek army has occupied the village of Delaftika, but 72 were killed and 50 wounded. As a result, the Greek army advanced ten kilometers in this area yesterday. Nine British and Greek aircraft bombed the extremely important Durazzo port in three batches. Gasoline warehouses and houses there caught fire. The battle of Argyrokastro seems to be concentrated in the mountains to the northwest. It is rumored that the Greek army has advanced within two miles of the city, while another account claims that the Greek army has captured it. However, all parties say that the Italian army has begun to withdraw from the city and is building strong positions in the mountains. General Soto, the Italian Undersecretary of the Army, has reportedly ordered that Argyrokastro be defended to the last man. (United Press dispatch, 28th)

General Badoglio has moved the Italian naval base from Valona to San Giorgio to avoid bombing by British and Greek aircraft. It was recently learned from reliable sources that a unit of the Italian army was detained in Yugoslavia after crossing the border between Lake Maligrad and Lake Ohrid. The Ministry of War's intelligence stated that the Greek Air Force bombed Italian concentration points in Albania yesterday, while Italian aircraft bombed villages in Epirus, Corfu, Cephalonia, and Crete, as well as the Greek port of Patras. The Royal Air Force Command stated that British and Greek aircraft made a "highly successful raid" on Valona on Tuesday. (Taiwan Public Dispatch, 28th)

Yugoslav Capital: Yugoslav officials issued a statement last night denying the claim that large numbers of Italian and Albanian troops had crossed into Yugoslav territory. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

Greek Army Continues to Advance Along the Entire Front, Breaking Through the New Italian Front Line

London: Athens Radio stated that the Greek army, which is continuing to advance along the entire front, has broken through the new Italian front line at various points. At the same time, serious turmoil has occurred near Elbasan, making it difficult for the Italian army to cope. The Greek army has now penetrated deep into Albanian territory, and its right wing has advanced north beyond Pogradec. The position of its artillery is ingenious and its firepower is accurate, preventing the Italian army from retreating, transporting supplies and war equipment. Among the recent spoils captured by the Greek army are six Italian trains abandoned by the Italian army. The Italian army is now digging trenches on both banks of the Chairo River near Pogradec to defend it. A major battle is expected in the area soon. Italian reinforcements, including many dive bombers, are rushing to the front. At the same time, Italian aircraft are bombing villages in the Epirus region and non-military targets on the islands of Corfu and Cephalonia. A recent communiqué from the Greek Public Security Department mentioned the bombing and strafing of Corfu, but the result of the attack is still unknown. The town of Lephri on the island of Cephalonia was bombed, causing some civilian casualties. The battle of Argyrokastro now seems to be concentrated in the mountains to the northwest. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

Athens: Today's front-line war report stated that the Italian army, under Mussolini's order to "defend to the death," strengthened its bridal procession last night and fought fiercely along the entire three front lines in Albania, its tenacity being unprecedented in the month since the start of the Italo-Greek War. Although the Italian army launched this death-defying battle, which was too late, the latest news said that the Greek army was still advancing bravely and deeply into Albania. According to intelligence arriving in Athens, after General Badoglio, Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, came to Albania to supervise the war, the Italian front lines in the areas of Argyrokastro, Moscopole, and Lake Ohrid have been corrected. According to reports, General Badoglio will go to Tirana to command the Italian counter-offensive on Monday. More than two weeks ago, when the Italian offensive began to falter, General Soto was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Italian army invading Greece, but now Badoglio has clearly taken over Soto's position. At the same time, it is learned that British aircraft recently bombed the vital port of Durazzo, turning it into ruins and forcing General Badoglio to lead his two divisions of reinforcements into Albania through a port further north of Durazzo. According to Greek sources, the Greek army occupied the strategically important village of Tsiraicho in the Pogradec area during a terrible artillery battle. It also said that the Greek army had made progress in the central region, repelling a fierce Italian counter-offensive north of Moscopole. (International Dispatch, 28th)

### Fierce Air Battles Between British and Italian Air Forces in Italian-Controlled Africa; British Aircraft Attack Benghazi with Considerable Success

Cairo: British bombers flew over a large area of Italian-controlled Africa yesterday, dropping hundreds of large and small bombs in the face of fierce anti-aircraft fire and enemy fighter attacks.

The port's docks, shipyards, and airfield construction sites were all bombed. One Italian fighter was shot down. British aircraft also bombed Sidi Barrani and Fort Laezza and other places in the western desert region. Enemy motor vehicle convoys and enemy military camps were hit by bombs like rain. One British aircraft was lost. British aircraft also attacked Halat Island with considerable success. British and Italian aircraft each lost one aircraft. British aircraft also bombed enemy troops concentrated in Tobruk, and all bombs hit the target area, but the extent of the damage could not be estimated due to the heavy dust on the ground.

Also, an Italian column in the Dabaa area was heavily bombed by British aircraft while it was marching, causing heavy casualties. An airfield in the area was also hit and damaged.

Every night when the full moon rose, the bombers took off one after another to fly to Ethiopia, returning together at dawn. One of the aircraft was unable to release one of the two wheels on its belly when it returned to the airfield, so the pilot landed safely using only one wheel, with only minor damage to the fuselage.

### Dutch Food Depleted by Looting

London: The Nazis are systematically seizing Dutch food and labor, resulting in a higher standard of living for the Germans than in other occupied areas, and there are fears that this will continue to increase. Three-quarters of Dutch railway vehicles have been transported to Germany. Coupled with the British Air Force's disruption of transportation, Dutch transportation is extremely difficult. Of the at least 8,000 tons of butter stored in the Netherlands, ninety percent had been transported away within the first week of the German occupation. The number of poultry has decreased from 28 million to 6 million, and all pigs have been slaughtered. Even a quarter of the Dutch dairy cows have been slaughtered. Now, the Dutch radio station controlled by the Germans even says that eating eggs for breakfast is an unnecessary luxury, and that abolishing tea and coffee will definitely be beneficial to health. Dutch housewives are currently lacking oil, as they can only receive half a liter of oil every six months. (November 28th, Reuters Telegram)

### French and Swiss Newspapers Reveal Inside Story of Soviet-German Talks: Maintain the Status Quo of Black Sea Coastal States

Lyon, France: The City Times recently published a telegram from its correspondent in the capital of Yugoslavia, revealing the results of the recent visit of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to Berlin. The main points are as follows: (1) The Soviet Union is considering signing a non-aggression pact with Japan. (2) The new European organization proposed by Germany can be approved by the Soviet Union. (3) Germany will avoid and not support any actions that may harm the interests of the Soviet Union in the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits. (4) Germany recognizes the current borders between the Soviet Union and Finland as immutable. (5) The Soviet Union and Germany will continue negotiations in Moscow. Apart from this, all actions of the Axis powers in the Balkan Peninsula can be considered as expressing Soviet consent. (November 27th, Havas Telegram)

Zurich: The New Chatelais Gazette's correspondent in Stamboul telegraphed further revelations about the inside story of the recent Soviet-German talks in Berlin. It is claimed that if Germany had a plan to invade Palestine and Egypt through Asia Minor and the Dardanelles, it must have been abandoned due to Soviet opposition. Moscow does not recognize the existence of the Axis group. Molotov only discussed issues related to the Soviet Union and Germany with Germany. Although the issues of the Near East and Central Asia were not mentioned, Molotov made it clear that the status quo of the Dardanelles and the Black Sea coastal states must be maintained. Moscow will have nothing to do with the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan. The Soviet government, shortly after the conclusion of the pact, declared its attitude towards the pact and told the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union that it had decided to continue assisting General Chiang Kai-shek. The first thing Molotov did after returning to Moscow from Berlin was to deny the rumor circulated by a British newspaper that the Soviet Union and Japan would conclude an agreement that included the condition that the Soviet Union would stop aiding China. Although Soviet-British relations are quite cold at present, the Soviet Union has decided to maintain its existing neutrality and will not unite with anyone to deal with Britain under any circumstances.

### Rumor: Vichy Government Rejects German Peace Terms: Reason for the Expulsion of Residents of Lorraine

London: According to absolutely reliable news from Vichy obtained by a special correspondent of the Free French News Agency, opinions differed within the Vichy cabinet when it met to discuss Hitler's peace terms for France, with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval and French armistice representative General Huntsinger nearly coming to blows. Finally, it was decided to reject Hitler's terms. The terms brought by Laval from Paris were: (1) Cession of Alsace-Lorraine; (2) Monthly release of 100,000 French prisoners of war, with the last batch to be released within two years; (3) No territory to be ceded to Italy except for Djibouti, but French domestic and colonial ports would be available for German ships to dock and procure supplies. General Huntsinger, an Alsatian, strongly opposed the last term, pointing out that this was a trap to drag France into the war against Britain, and that Germany's real goal was to prove that Germany was not as powerful as it claimed to be. Laval, who secretly plotted to help Germany attack Britain and had obtained the support of Naval Minister Darlan, strongly refuted General Huntsinger's views. The two sides engaged in a verbal battle that nearly turned into a fistfight, but after three cabinet meetings, Laval finally failed. As a result, General Petain did not mention the terms of the peace treaty in his broadcast at the end of October. After this, Hitler forcibly expelled the French from Lorraine Province. Hearing that Hitler was preparing to sacrifice Italian demands in exchange for the use of French ports, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini prematurely launched an attack on Greece.

### Internal Unrest in Romania After Massacre; Army Generals Resign; Romanian Government Investigates Perpetrators

Bucharest: After the gruesome massacre of 64 political enemies of the pro-German Iron Guard in Romania, revolutionary actions seem imminent. Romanian dictator Prime Minister Antonescu has taken stern measures yesterday to crush this impending action. In an effort to prevent internal strife, the Romanian government has persuaded the army and the Iron Guard to abandon their past resentments. The hatred between the two sides, which is nearing the breaking point, is well known. When the 64 Romanian government leaders who were shot were lined up and executed at the graves of three deceased Iron Guard members, the crowd watched in breathless silence. In this scene of "Balkan Vendetta," the corpses of the 64 people were still lying on the graves this morning. These 13 people were allegedly involved in a plot to overthrow the government of the deposed King Carol two years ago and were killed. Iron Guard leader Codreanu was also among them. At the same time, it was also heard that the Iron Guard yesterday again demanded the extradition of Carol's mistress, Lupescu. They believed that the mistress was responsible for the killing of the 13 Iron Guard members. This red-haired mistress, for whom King Carol once abandoned the throne because he was in love with her, is now rumored to be living with him in Spain. It is claimed that the Iron Guard wants the mistress to return to Romania to "stand trial." After yesterday's massacre, the Fascist Party issued a warning that the killings had not stopped. Therefore, General Antonescu quickly took drastic measures to prevent the outbreak of chaos. Although Antonescu will convene an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss "how to deal with the Iron Guard's anarchic actions," the murderers may still escape justice, as the method of punishing the murderers has not yet been decided. It is rumored that Antonescu is quite afraid that this move will cause internal unrest. (November 28th, International News Agency Telegram)

Bucharest: The curtain has fallen on one of the greatest tragedies of revenge in Romanian history. The remains of Colonel Codreanu, the leader of the Romanian Iron Guard who was killed two years ago, and 13 Iron Guard members, were moved last night to the altar of the Greek Orthodox Cathedral. These remains of the Iron Guard members were transported to the church after 64 political leaders from the former King's era were murdered by Iron Guard members in the courtyard of the Gilaeva military prison, the same place where Codreanu and his followers were executed in 1938. After the officials of the former King's era were killed, the Iron Guard leader issued a public statement calling on Iron Guard members across the country to maintain party discipline. Members of the Romanian Cabinet also declared that severe punishment would be imposed on those who carried out the massacre. Romanian newspapers and radio stations did not publish news of this mass execution. Only the official newspapers this morning published a public statement from the cabinet meeting. The Iron Guard has now taken over the church where the remains of the Iron Guard members are placed. In addition to calling on Iron Guard members across Romania to maintain order and discipline, the Iron Guard and political public statements also stated that "anyone who violates discipline is a traitor and should be severely punished." In addition, there was a public statement guaranteeing that the Romanian Iron Guard would be loyal to Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu. News about the arrest of former Prime Minister Aquitonian Geik was denied by senior officials. Some people said that there must still be killings in various parts of Romania. As for the news of the killing of other people, there is no official confirmation. Because when Codreanu was killed, hundreds of Iron Guard members in various parts of Romania were also killed. (November 28th, United Press Telegram)

Bucharest: The Romanian government issued the following official gazette last night, stating that according to Prime Minister Antonescu's declaration, when the government ordered the excavation of the bodies of the assassinated members of the Legion in Gilaeva on the night of November 26, the Legion members in the area suddenly mutinied, broke into the prison, and arbitrarily opened fire on political prisoners involved in the case. Such actions are deeply disapproved of by the Prime Minister and the Romanian Legion. The Legion is prepared to hand over the perpetrators to the government for prosecution. Any such illegal actions in the future will be severely punished. At the same time, State Councillor and Legion Leader Siama also issued a circular, ordering all members to abide by the law and discipline, and those who violate it will be severely punished. (November 28th, Haitong Telegram)

Bucharest: Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu issued a long article last night, expressing dissatisfaction with the unexpected incident in Gilaeva. Iron Guard Leader Siama also issued a declaration, calling on the Legionnaires to support General Antonescu. According to well-informed sources, the Gilaeva incident did not affect the government's position. (November 28th, Haitong Telegram)

Bucharest: 64 political prisoners in the Gilaeva military prison in Romania have been killed. The State Council met at 11:00 a.m., with Antonescu presiding. Siama also went to the police station in the morning to investigate the truth. Antonescu and Siama were not informed of the Iron Guard's killing of political prisoners. The Iron Guard members were probably worried that the political prisoners who sentenced the former Iron Guard leader Kadlianu to death might be released, so they took direct action. Former Prime Minister Yuga was released in the afternoon after being arrested. (November 28th, Haitong Telegram)

Bucharest: After the Romanian Iron Guard shot 64 political enemies in the early morning yesterday, the government took repressive measures to prevent the outbreak of internal unrest. However, yesterday evening, self-appointed gunmen from the Iron Guard continued their mad actions, killing more of their enemies in addition to the 64 people. Because Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu wanted to make an effort to prevent conflict between the army and the rebels, the Romanian regular army was ready for emergency action yesterday evening. After 64 former Romanian politicians were killed in the Gilaeva military prison, the Romanian army generals immediately submitted their resignations, but the army generals obeyed General Antonescu's orders to stop the possible rebellion. (November 28th, International Telegram)

Bucharest: Prominent Romanian officials who were arrested the night before, such as former Prime Minister Tatalescu, former cabinet members Aquitonian, Gairmeceanu, Gigudulic, and General Yasiovich, were released yesterday. The number of political prisoners shot yesterday is unknown, but according to reliable sources, former National Peasant Party Secretary-General Machianu has been shot. Machianu has been a cabinet member several times and is usually leftist. (November 28th, Haitong Telegram)

Budapest: Hungarian Foreign Minister Csaky explained Hungary's diplomatic relations to the Hungarian National Assembly Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, especially regarding Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact. Csaky pointed out that when the Tripartite Pact was announced, the government unanimously decided to begin negotiations on Hungary's accession to the pact without delay. Regarding this matter, the German Foreign Minister provided assurances to Hungary that if Hungary were invaded, the three signatory countries would definitely assist Hungary. However, on the other hand, if the three signatory countries were attacked by any country that has not yet participated in the war after Hungary's accession, Hungary must declare that it stands on the side of the three countries. After careful consideration, the Hungarian government decided that, given the expected benefits, Hungary decided to take the risk of joining the pact. Csaky then pointed out the various benefits of joining the pact and mentioned the purpose of the Tripartite Pact stated by the German Foreign Minister at the Belvedere Fortress on November 10, which does not include actions outside of Hungary's foreign policy. Csaky continued that although Hungary deeply believes that it will be better off united with Germany after it collapsed in 1918 for future hope, it would be better than associating with England and France. Looking at the fate of the six governments that fled to London can serve as a warning. Some people are satisfied that Greece has not been occupied by Italy, but it is still too early. Italy's military strength is enough to make some countries lower their heads and think carefully, and countries that are unwilling or unable to back down will ultimately suffer the consequences. Hungary is willing to maintain closer relations with Yugoslavia. Political and economic weakness in Yugoslavia is harmful to Hungary and not beneficial. Csaky firmly believes that if the strengths of all parties can be united, peace can be restored in the Balkans, or at least dangerous disturbances cannot invade Hungary's borders.

### More European War Talks 24: Underground Life of Londoners

For three months, the German air force has dropped no less than 50 million pounds of bombs on Britain. Aside from material losses, approximately 3,500 civilians have lost their lives. Naturally, London has suffered the most. However, the British people’s perseverance and fighting spirit are admirable. On the surface, London appears scarred and battered, but it is estimated that only one percent of the buildings have been damaged by bombing. As for the loss of life, the total number in three months is less than the number of people killed in traffic accidents in the United States in one month. Nevertheless, the constant bombing by German aircraft has greatly demoralized the public. One sleepless night can ruin three days of energy, let alone three consecutive months. It is understandable that people are weary.

The authorities are using every means of written propaganda to encourage morale and boost morale. The "London Express" once told the public, "If you can continue to work, then we can defeat Germany. If you cannot, then we will be defeated by them." These short sentences are concise and inspiring. The authorities also posted notices in prominent places, urging the people not to be discouraged and encouraging their spirit of sustained warfare. Recently, a notice was unearthed from a trench on the front line of the British army during the last war. That team of soldiers was ordered to hold their ground, not to leave without authorization, and wait for reinforcements. As a result, the entire team died. The order was signed by an Australian officer, and it read: (1) This stronghold must be held. Do not leave without authorization until reinforcements arrive. (2) Under no circumstances should the enemy succeed. (3) If you cannot hold this point alive, you must hold it in death. (4) Anyone who intends to surrender because of shell shock must still die here. (5) If one stronghold is held, the entire front line can be preserved.

Londoners often proudly show the world their spirit of "walking" to air raid shelters rather than "running" to air raid trenches. The authorities warned the people to prepare some drinking water to bring into the air raid shelters in case the main water pipes explode and they have no water to drink. They also told them to always turn off the gas pipes when leaving their homes. During air raids, most commercial firms, except for banks, continue to operate as usual. After jewelry stores are bombed, the owners often lead their staff to search for gems and diamonds in the rubble. Many people die from flying glass shards, which have the power of bullets.

The most frustrated people are the pregnant women in London, whose total number is around 50,000. There are also 100,000 mothers with infants who find it very troublesome to breastfeed and change diapers under the blackout. A London woman, Mrs. Foster, was in labor during the constant bombing by German aircraft. One day, she went into labor during an air raid. Her husband was out serving, and she could not find a doctor. Only an air raid warden was by her side. A bomb exploded 80 yards away, blowing away the roof and windows of her bedroom. The warden delivered her baby in the dark rubble, and a healthy baby was successfully born.

The new incendiary bombs dropped by German aircraft in London contain aluminum and iron oxide, and have a burning power of up to 4,000 degrees. After falling to the ground, they are difficult to extinguish. After the air raid is over, the debris is still burning on the ground. Some passers-by even light their cigarettes with it, or use it to warm their hands. It can be said that it is a waste of talent.

The following narrative is the experience of "Life" magazine and "New York Times" correspondents in London, [blank] Gliner and [blank] Mickey, on the night of September 18, when German aircraft raided London. Every word is a true account of being there, and it makes people shudder to read it:

Gliner: "At 7:45 PM, after collecting information about Churchill in the library reference department of the "Daily Express" building, I hired a streetcar to go home. The driver drove quickly, passing through the dark streets. He wanted to drive out of central London before the air raid alarm sounded. Our residence is in a quiet part of London, in a 17th-century ochre house. Before the war, this house was occupied by the movie star Charles Laughton. I was having dinner. Since the air raids started in London, the gas has been cut off, so I have been cooking with an electric stove. Suddenly, I heard German aircraft buzzing in the air, and anti-aircraft guns roaring. The whistling sound of bombs and the sound of explosions followed one another. The sound became louder and louder, and I decided to run down to the basement cellar to hide temporarily."

Mickey: "Before evening, I went to the cinema to watch the newsreel, and decided to have dinner in the fourth district, without returning home to eat. When I was eating scrambled eggs and drinking half a bottle of French wine, the waiter announced the night's 'Mona' (this is Londoners' nickname for air raid alarms. The lifting of the alarm is called 'Clara'). After I finished eating, I started to go home. The air was filled with the smell of gunpowder, and the anti-aircraft fire was so bright that I could read a newspaper in the middle of the road. During an air raid, there is no way to hail a cab, so I didn't bother wasting time, and just walked and ran toward home. When I encountered an explosive overhead, I jumped into someone's doorway to hide temporarily. Londoners call this way of walking 'doorway hopping'! As I was approaching the house, a red light suddenly appeared to the right, followed by a violent explosion. Because there was no doorway in the middle of the road to hide temporarily, I had to stand still. Nothing fell beside me, and I ran straight to the house. When I got home, I saw Gliner hiding in the basement, and the housekeeper was about to run out to greet her husband. When the sound of anti-aircraft guns stopped, I rushed upstairs to change into old clothes, preparing to lie in the basement. The housekeeper also followed upstairs to call her husband."

### Food: Foreign Rice Still Arriving, Rice Prices Still Rising, Speculators Swarming the Rice Market, Manipulating People's Food Supply, Placing Conscience Outside Their Bellies, Those With Responsibilities Fail to Fulfill Their Duties

Foreign rice arrived in Shanghai again yesterday, brought by Taikoo Company ships. The Jiangsu ship brought 1,450 bags from Hong Kong, the Taiyuan ship also brought 4,699 bags from Hong Kong, and the Guangdong ship brought 6,032 bags from Hong Kong. In addition, 3,635 bags were transported from [blank] Luo. Yesterday, the three ships brought a total of 15,820 bags. ([blank])

Yesterday, the foreign rice market was again misled by rumors, and the buying mood in the market became stronger. Although there was no formal increase in actual sales, the market transaction was surrounded by speculation. Yesterday, not only rice merchants were engaged in absorption, but also outside industries such as finance, yarn and cotton were active in the rice market, especially the cotton yarn groups, who were most greedy. Not only did they absorb spot and futures, but they were also quite greedy for spot rice. Because new transactions of Yinghua Sika have been rare recently, those who hold inventory are hoarding and not selling, and the market chips are suddenly depleted. Therefore, the whole-day Yinghua Sika only closed 500 to 600 tons, while the spot was absorbed by large outside households, and the transaction reached 14,000 to 5,000 bags. The market price saw an increase in the early market, followed by a progressive increase. By the evening closing, it rose by one yuan to [blank] one and a half yuan. No. 1 Saigon Yinghua Sika spot opened at 90 yuan in the afternoon, and the price has been shouted up to 91 yuan, but it is still lacking a complete exit. No. 2 spot is 86 yuan and 3 jiao, December is 84 yuan to 84 yuan and 4 and a half jiao, Xiao Jiao is 80 yuan and 3 jiao to 82 yuan and 8 jiao. At such a rice price, I don't know what will happen, and it is no longer affordable for the average citizen. Many have changed from three meals a day to two meals, and for those who live from hand to mouth, with slightly more family members, it is impossible to get even a porridge and a meal, resulting in beggars on the road and starvation everywhere, and theft cases occur from time to time, all of which are the result of oppression and exploitation by speculators and powerful people. As the saying goes, "If you want to eat sheep brains, you are not afraid of sheep's life," manipulating the people's food supply and placing conscience outside their bellies. Although the facts are so, those who have the duty of guarding and governing cannot shirk their responsibility.

Slightly more new japonica tip and tea seeds arrived, totaling more than 1,000 shi. The local stores were also quite deserted in the sales market, so the selling price also increased by half a yuan. The opening price of new japonica special original package was 94 yuan and a half, the market was 92 yuan and a half, 92 yuan, the hopper saw 88 yuan, 86 yuan, tea [blank] the hopper saw 81 yuan and a half, 81 yuan, Du Jianzhong was 76 yuan and a half, Yang Jianzhong was 71 yuan and 8 jiao.

Glutinous rice also went smoothly, and there were large households absorbing it, so the price also increased by one yuan [blank]. Kai Yili Bai Yuan was 86 yuan, 84 yuan, Hong Kong Bai Yuan was 78 yuan, 75 yuan and a half.

### Foreign Flour Orders

Flour is scheduled from the current period. According to the investigation, since the No. 2 Flour Mill raised its price, it will not be changed for the time being. However, the supply of each factory is decreasing day by day, and the current flour is gradually becoming scarce. For example, the old car brand and Fuxin brand have long been unable to buy goods. Therefore, customers are paying attention to foreign flour. The goods that have been ordered before and have not arrived are being pre-sold in the market. Yesterday, 4,500 white bags of flower and bird and clock tower brands were absorbed by this street and customer hoarding, and the price rose from 18 yuan, 5 jiao and 6 jiao to 18 yuan and 8 jiao. The old car stack has only a few transactions. It is said that the resold Tianzhu brand factory flour is sold at a price of 19 yuan and 6 jiao, and 200 bags have been received from this street.

The wheat market is tight. According to the investigation, the amount of Changxi Du wheat transported by car has increased slightly compared to before, but it must be specified and sent directly to the Japanese factory for unpacking. As for the [blank] factory, it is still difficult to receive goods and it is unwilling to release prices to collect them. It is said that foreign wheat orders are still being negotiated, but due to the lack of ship positions, they cannot arrive on time. Therefore, both buyers and sellers are still hesitating. The factory is also unwilling to publicly order a large amount of foreign wheat.

### Oilseed and Oil, Market Manipulation, No Opportunity

Yesterday's oil market, due to the lack of new stimulus, manipulators had no opportunity. The market was calm, and the market price was slightly different. Tongshi opened 40 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, the price was 72 yuan and 5 jiao, 30 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil, 74 yuan and 5 jiao, 200 dan of Dayouyu factory soybean oil, 80 yuan, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, 75 yuan, 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 103 yuan and 5 jiao. 800 barrels were ordered for delivery in December, and the price was from 104 yuan to 5 jiao, and the closing price was 103 yuan and 7 jiao and a half. The trend is slightly smaller, which is also possible.

On the 28th, there were 425 bags of soybeans, and on the 29th, there were another 125 bags of soybeans, 23,200 pieces of soybean cakes, 1,140 bags of sesame seeds, and 200 cans of sesame oil, all of which were transported to Hong Kong. On the 28th, 310 bags of soybeans were imported from Tianjin.

### Securities: London Foreign Debt Soars, All Debts Rise by One or Two Pounds, Domestic Debt Falls, Buyers Still Not Weak

In the off-market securities market yesterday, rumors of Nanjing suddenly became popular, and people's hearts became tired. Many floats came out, but short sellers hedged and buyers were still not weak. The opening price was still firm, but the selling was strong and slowly declined. After struggling several times, it was suppressed to 64 yuan and temporarily became crowded. It may be reduced again. The transaction was flat yesterday morning. Type C initially rushed out of 64 yuan, and then declined because Sheng Chang Hengfu Lianyi sold a lot. Lianhe Hongda Jiufeng Dade and others bought in, but failed to raise it. The afternoon closing was slightly reduced by one or two jiao. In the afternoon, although Dade Jiufeng still bought in, Yitai Dingkang also absorbed it, and Shuntai Shunchang also hedged, but Xinfu came out, and Yuxing also had spot goods flowing out. The market felt unsustainable and continued to decline. As a result, all of them fell by two and a half to five jiao, except for Type A, which only fell by five points. The total number of transactions was about 1.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading, the transaction was Huashang Electric

300 shares, the price was 7 yuan and 2 jiao.

In the public industry stock market, the trend was quiet in the morning. In the afternoon, guided by rubber stocks, the market suddenly turned firm.

Yesterday's gold market, the cooked red off-market, suddenly tended to rise sharply from the flat and tired. The 5,700 yuan mark had returned several times, and finally it was close to the 5,800 yuan mark. All parties were very determined. It was rumored that Japan had asked China for peace, but it was not allowed. There was a rumor that they would recognize a certain party. Speculators were actually creating a multi-profit atmosphere, and the foreign exchange rate was tight, which led to a buying trend. Since the morning opening was still flat, still 5,705 yuan, the gold shop Qianzhuang sold out, and it was suppressed to 5,690 yuan. The silver shop bill merchants absorbed it, and the price fluctuated around 5,700 yuan. It once rose sharply at noon, but it was flat soon.

### Cooked Red Jumped 85 Yuan

Initially, it seemed quite deserted, with few transactions and flat prices. According to the 20 taels of the gold shop, it was 5,705 yuan, as the morning opening price. Soon, the Qiandui industry sold 30 taels to the silver shop, and suppressed it to within 5,700 yuan, at 5,690 yuan. Later, the silver shop gang slightly increased the purchase, and the decline stopped and rebounded, but the rise and fall were limited. The silver shop entered the gold shop with 20 taels, 5,708 yuan, and the Qiandui industry sold another 20 taels to the silver shop, which was as low as 5,695 yuan. Afterwards, due to the shift from loose and flat to soft in foreign exchange, retail investors all thought about buying, and the silver shop gang continued to dredge, and Yuhao sold 30 taels to the silver shop for 5,720 yuan. Under the pressure of sales from the Qiandui industry at noon, it still fell by 10, and the gold shop entered 10 taels for 5,712 yuan. The opening in the afternoon had become firm.

### Foreign Currencies Also Rose Sharply

Yesterday's foreign currency market, the cooked red market price rose sharply, the British and American gold pounds also rose by 2 yuan each, the British gold ticket suddenly became dull again, and the market price stood flat. The US gold ticket stood out at the 17 yuan mark, because there was a new message about the "Central Bank" in the market, which caused the black market foreign exchange to rise again, and the US gold ticket rose to 17 yuan, 1 jiao and 8 points, a sharp rise of 4 jiao compared to the previous day. Hong Kong ticket trend was firm, the evening market was 4 yuan and 3 points. Canadian tickets and Philippine tickets were also firm. There was a strong demand for Japanese gold Cai and Korean tickets. The former was as high as 1 yuan, 5 jiao and 4 points, and the latter rose to 1 yuan, 1 jiao and 6 and a half points.

### Yarn and Cotton, Cotton Yarn Hesitating, 200 Yuan Mark Entering and Exiting

The yarn market has entered a revolving state again, but the inferior form is relatively quiet, because the rumors of the previous day are not credible, so it is difficult for general shorts to see small, but old bulls have not shaken, so it once broke into the 1,200 yuan mark, and once came back to pull short, and the market rebound and rise, but the current spot sales are still weak, and the power of doing more has not been fully developed. Judging from the current situation, it will not tend to fall. Yesterday, there were 1,660 pieces of cotton yarn, today there were 510 pieces transported to Hong Kong, and another 40 pieces transported to Xiao Luzon, and 10 pieces transported to Siam.

Shuangma opened stably in the morning, and the first round price was 1,211 yuan, which was not much different from the previous day's price. As soon as this round opened, short sellers were extremely active, and the selling was dense for a time, falling directly to within 1,200 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,198 yuan. Later, I heard that the foreign exchange was calm, and the price had fallen, so the selling was unwilling to add more, and instead saw a replenishment. So the chips turned tight, and the tailwind suddenly appeared, and it rose out of the pass again, rising to 1,210 yuan. Later, there were those who took profits and sold out, and at the same time, actual sales were weak, and the decline was seen again, but the bulls did not give up, and the closing price was 1,214 yuan. According to the half-day [blank] transaction statistics of 6,310 bales, the price of 20 Shuangma yarns rose by 1 yuan. The amount bought by each gang is listed on the left,

### Cotton Merchants Watch

Spot cotton transactions are even more sluggish, and the market is weak, and factory forces are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude. As for the merchants, in view of the above situation, the way out is not good, and their actions are not as prosperous as in the past, but the general psychology is still optimistic.

Foreign cotton market price, New York cotton market, in the early morning, first because the telegram from Liverpool reported a rise, and then because of the weakness of the Wall Street stock market, and the closing price as a result of some southern set buying, was 34 pounds lower than the previous day, and India rose by more than 1 rupee along with the forecast.

Shanghai foreign cotton transactions have been quite quiet recently, and the purchase from all parties is very weak, especially from the factory. The industry is also temporarily holding a wait-and-see attitude, but it is generally expected that the cotton market will turn around in mid-F month.

### Reduced Prices for Piece Goods and Cotton Cloth Still Draw Buyers

Factory Cloth: The market was stable yesterday, with price fluctuations of only a few cents. Sales continued steadily, and there were rumors that the factory unified tax would be temporarily suspended from increasing, which greatly boosted confidence.

Eastern Cloth: Prices fell in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon, and the market strengthened. White cloth, particularly the best fine cloth, once dropped to 34.80 yuan in the morning. However, the market improved due to rising bid prices, and merchants here were optimistic, continuing to buy. Prices rose accordingly, and the best fine cloth sold at 35.30 yuan at closing, up one and a half cents per piece. Serge sold for 1.08 yuan.

Exports: On the 28th, 2,680 pieces of cloth were shipped to Hong Kong, and on the 29th, 13 pieces were shipped to Luzon, 42 pieces to Siam, and 1,695 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Mohair Gains Popularity

Mohair has been selling well recently because its pile is neat and even, its luster is bright, and it comes in many colors. Most of the local ladies are flocking to it, and "sea white dragon" wool is now considered outdated. Therefore, most new women's overcoats are made of mohair. They are also buying matching handbags, which cost at least 25 or 26 yuan in legal tender per bag. Thus, a mohair overcoat costs at least 150 or 160 yuan in legal tender. The most popular colors are very light sky blue and navy blue. Wholesale prices are 87 or 88 yuan per yard, while "Three Camel" brand "sea white dragon" wool sells for 64 or 65 yuan.

This store's No. 1 rock sugar was 92 yuan, and Jingming rock sugar was 93.50 yuan (slightly more).

### North-South Goods: Shortage of Orchid Bamboo Branches

Recently, Jinshan orchid bamboo branches have been sluggish due to price cuts. However, production costs have not decreased and there have been unexpected expenses such as special fees, which have increased costs and created a difficult situation. Consequently, the supply is extremely scarce, and it is said that the brokers are collectively holding onto unsold goods. If sales can improve, there is hope for a recovery.

### Medicinal Materials: Ginseng, Deer Velvet, and White Fungus Exceedingly Expensive

With the arrival of winter, it is the season for tonics, and the market for ginseng, deer velvet, and white fungus is active. Sichuan white fungus is in extremely short supply, and prices have been rising again this week, with top-grade selling for over 260 yuan per catty, mid-grade for over 160 yuan per catty, and even F-grade requiring about 100 yuan per catty. Jilin Changbai Mountain ginseng is not available this year due to government control, and the ginseng being sold is old stock from previous years. Prices are extraordinarily high, with ginseng weighing one tael selling for 1,500 yuan per tael and ginseng weighing over one qian selling for 400 yuan per tael. Deer velvet is heavily taxed, with strong antlers costing 3,000 yuan per pair and ordinary ones costing around 2,000 yuan. Cut velvet sells for 90 or 80 yuan per tael. Other direct ginseng, with 30 pieces per catty, is scarce, and sales are strong. The listed price is 290 yuan per catty, but it is difficult to obtain, and a premium of 10 yuan must be added to buy one or two pieces at 300 yuan per catty, as merchants are very optimistic and expect prices to rise to 320 yuan. Fortunately, these are luxury items, and although expensive, they do not affect people's livelihoods.

### Hardware: Cement and Steel Bars Return to Normal

The previously declining market for cement and steel bars saw improvement yesterday. Because construction companies and Tianjin merchants were purchasing, merchants regained confidence, and the market began to turn around. Sales yesterday totaled 40 to 50 tons, and prices increased due to demand, with three- to four-point sizes at 1,150 yuan and five-point to one-inch sizes at 1,890 yuan, all up 30 to 40 yuan from before.

### New Dollar Exceeds the 60 Yuan Mark

Although trading in new dollars was not very lively yesterday, merchants were unusually optimistic. Although goods are still being shipped from overseas, costs are very high, and freight rates have doubled, so market prices have been rising daily. Sales yesterday totaled 30 to 40 tons, and asking prices exceeded the 60 yuan mark.

### Coal: Indian Coal Slightly Higher in Unofficial Trading

Although the city has ample reserves of Indian bituminous coal, imports have been scarce in recent months due to high freight rates and soaring costs. Yesterday, stockyard prices rose slightly, with Indian bituminous coal warehouse receipts trading at 208 yuan unofficially, up 5 or 6 yuan from the beginning of the month, though the listed price remained at 210 yuan.

### Improved Treatment Soon to Be Realized, Chinese Constables Faithfully Serve, Report to Duty as Usual, No Strike Occurrences, Bureau Long Considered Difficult Living Conditions

Major Bowen of the Public Works Department Police Division denied the rumors circulating yesterday that Chinese constables were threatening to strike over demands for a pay raise. He told reporters that the Chinese constables had all reported to duty and there had been no strike threats. Bowen said that before reporting to duty, the Chinese constables at each police station only expressed their desire to receive increased wages and rice subsidies, and then reported to duty as usual. The Public Works Department had already considered increasing the salaries and rice subsidies of Chinese constables and it may be implemented soon. Bowen denied that there was any organized expression of dissatisfaction in the police division he leads. He said that although the demands for increased salaries and rice subsidies were made simultaneously by Chinese constables at each police station on Wednesday (the 27th), this matter did not have any significant importance. Bowen explained that it was possible that the Chinese constables at each police station had heard that the Chinese constables at the Jing'an Temple police station would make this request, so they also decided to make the request at the same time.

Chinese Constables Demand Improved Treatment

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that Chinese constables at the five police stations in the Public Concession had threatened to strike in order to obtain higher monthly salaries, which could lead to the most serious labor unrest in the city's history. However, according to Bowen, head of the Public Works Department Police Division, Chinese constables' monthly salaries would soon be increased somewhat, and the matter could be resolved without difficulty. The matter began yesterday (the 27th) in the afternoon, when the night shift Chinese constables at four police stations, including 88 at the Jing'an Temple police station, 25 at the Gordon Road police station, and 20 each at the Prude Road and New Zhabei police stations, refused to report to duty.

Police Officers Guarantee Consideration

Just after noon today (the 28th), 50 Chinese constables at the Chengdu Road police station also refused to report to duty after signing in. Their representatives then held secret talks with the Western police officers in charge, and some of the Chinese constables had already returned to work as usual. The striking Chinese constables said that their current monthly salaries were insufficient to live on, so they demanded an immediate increase in basic monthly salaries and rice subsidies. After the Western police officers guaranteed that those in charge would consider the matter carefully, they returned to duty together. As of today, they are still working as usual, and a response is being awaited from the Police Division.

How to Increase Is Being Studied

Bowen told reporters that he had been discussing the matter with the leaders of the Chinese constables for the past two or three weeks and had already prepared to increase the monthly salaries of the Chinese constables, but the details of how to increase the salaries had not yet been determined. It was unlikely that the increase would be in the form of increased rice subsidies. As the matter has not been completely resolved, a decision has not yet been made to notify the Chinese constables, but once the Chinese constables learn of the decision, the matter should be resolved.

Amount of Rice Subsidy Based on Market Price

The current minimum monthly salary for Chinese constables in the Public Concession is 18 yuan, plus a cost-of-living allowance of 85%, a rice subsidy of 9 yuan, and a clothing allowance of some amount. The Chinese constables said that although rice prices reached an unprecedented high yesterday, their rice subsidy had recently been reduced by 1.5 yuan. Public Works Department officials said that the subsidy is determined by market prices and is subject to change.

Authorities Appreciate Difficult Living Conditions

Nash, Assistant Director of the Public Works Department, said that the authorities are considering the difficulties faced by the Chinese constables. Now that everything seems to be calm and the Chinese constables have reported back to duty, it seems likely that an agreement can be reached. As for whether the dispute can be resolved within the next two days, it is still impossible to say, because the solution must be approved by the various committees of the Bureau.

### Japanese Third Fleet Concentrated in Zhoushan

Including Two Aircraft Carriers According to Reliable Information from the Shipping Industry The Ships of the Japanese Third Fleet Stationed in China are Now Massing in the Waters of the Zhoushan Islands. At Daishan Dongshajiao, Shenjiadou, Maqimen, and Dinghai Toutougang, from Donggangpu in the east to Zhushanmen in the west, a total of fifteen or sixteen Japanese warships of various sizes have gathered. The seized foreign ships Moufu, Feikang, and Dasheng are also being monitored. Among them are two aircraft carriers, anchored nearby, and there is frequent movement back and forth, suggesting possible intentions. The Chinese military along the coast has been placed on high alert.

### Joint Consultation by Authorities of the Two Concessions: Abolishing Malpractices of "Small Rents"

Both Parties Engaging in Parallel Research, Several Joint Meetings Held

Information received yesterday indicates that the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession have held several joint meetings to discuss abolishing the malpractice of "small rents" within the two concessions. According to a spokesperson for the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), the French Concession's special committee recently submitted a report suggesting steps to abolish "small rents" within the concession. The SMC has since held several talks with the French authorities and will likely continue these discussions. Both concessions are currently engaged in parallel research on the issue of abolishing "small rents." However, the SMC is currently only conducting research and has not made any decisions. Meanwhile, residents of the French Concession are continuing to urge French Consul-General M. Mazerat to accept the committee's recommendation to eliminate malpractices such as "small rents," but there is no indication of when M. Mazerat will make a decision.

No Forced Eviction for Timely Rent Payment

According to the Shanghai Times, French Consul-General in Shanghai, M. Mazerat, recently received the draft of the consular order (i.e., housing regulations) prepared by the French Concession Housing Management Committee and has listened to reports and criticisms from various parties to address any shortcomings in the consular order. A well-known French lawyer in the city, who has written commentaries on housing issues, visited M. Mazerat yesterday (the 27th) afternoon and suggested including a clause in the consular order stipulating that landlords cannot force tenants to move out if they pay their rent on time, and if they agree to a reasonable rent increase, regardless of whether the lease has expired. Implementing this clause would prevent landlords from forcing tenants whose leases have expired to move out in order to lease the premises to tenants who can pay higher rents and "small rents." If this clause is not implemented, the entire consular order will be ineffective, as landlords seeking profit will exploit this loophole. It is generally believed that the French Consul-General will discuss in detail the draft consular order that has been published in various newspapers recently and will soon take full steps to eliminate methods of extortion such as exorbitant rent increases and the collection of "small rents."

### Shanghai "City Police" Arbitrarily Detains Truck, Attempts to Extort Fees, Released After Negotiation

According to the English-language China Press, a truck belonging to Moutrie & Co. was traveling along the Xijiao (Western District) Lujiatai Road at around 11:00 AM yesterday (the 27th) when a "city policeman" ordered it to stop. When the driver refused, another "city policeman" jumped onto the truck's running board and forced the driver to stop. The truck was then detained. At noon, Moutrie & Co. received a phone call from the "City Police Bureau," stating that the truck did not have a "city permit" and required a payment of 120 yuan, or the truck would not be released. The management of Moutrie & Co. replied that they would not pay the fee until a reason was given. In the afternoon, a worker from the truck brought back a letter from the "Public Security Bureau, Xujiahui Branch," stating that a payment of 41 yuan and 93 cents was required to obtain a permit. After receiving the letter, Moutrie & Co. reported the matter to the Jing'an Temple Police Station for negotiation. The truck was finally released at around 4:30 PM without any payment.

### Procedures for Going to Hong Kong Remain Unchanged, No Immediate Plans to Establish Immigration Bureau Office in Shanghai

Since the Hong Kong government promulgated new immigration control regulations, scheduled to take effect on the 18th of next month, major shipping companies in Shanghai, such as China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Java-China-Japan Lijn, Jardine Matheson & Co., and Butterfield & Swire, have successively telegraphed their Hong Kong offices to inquire about what additional procedures Shanghai passengers going to Hong Kong would need to complete. However, as of yesterday, no replies had been received from Hong Kong. It is reported that the British Consulate in Shanghai has also not received any telegrams from Hong Kong, so they are unable to answer inquiries from passengers. Whether travel procedures will change will be determined after a reply arrives in Shanghai. According to the shipping industry, the procedures for Shanghai passengers going to Hong Kong will be determined after the establishment of an immigration bureau office in Shanghai, based on the new immigration regulations.

### Various Parties Criticize Telephone Price Increase After Public Announcement, Contradiction Between Adding New Lines and Reducing Usage, Citizens Eagerly Awaiting Chinese Directors to Argue on Sound Grounds

The Shanghai Telephone Company, citing increased demand and inability to cope, proposed a request to increase surcharges. After being approved by the authorities of the two concessions and announced to take effect on the 7th of next month, various circles in Shanghai were in uproar upon hearing the news, expressing dissatisfaction. According to general opinions from the Chinese side, the company's main reason for the increase is the need to add new lines and expand equipment. Under the current situation of increased demand, this move by the company is certainly justifiable.

New Line Costs Should Be Amortized

However, although the cost of adding new lines is high, the period of use is also very long. If the price of new lines is calculated based on the years of use, the average annual cost is very small. Now the company is increasing prices by more than double. Not to mention that it has completely lost the meaning of a public utility, it is also difficult to reconcile with the company's stated reason for the increase. After the company increases prices, revenue will increase by 70%, but the average annual cost of purchasing new lines during their period of use is actually far lower than this figure.

Reduction of Calls Lacks Justification

Furthermore, the reason for reducing the number of basic calls and increasing the price of exceeding the number of calls is to reduce the number of calls and increase the rate. However, as long as this abnormal prosperity exists, it will be difficult to reduce the number of calls. Moreover, since the company wants to add new lines to meet customer needs, it seems contradictory to restrict customer usage. Currently, the general residents of Shanghai are eagerly awaiting the Chinese directors to argue on sound grounds and try to reverse the situation to reduce the increase, otherwise Shanghai's commerce will suffer an adverse impact, and residents' lives will become more painful.

Special Telephones Will Also Increase in Price

Special telephones of the Shanghai Telephone Company, such as "short-distance calls" connecting to the Nanshi (Chinese City) and Zhabei (Chapei) city centers, previously cost 10 cents in legal tender each time. It is now reported that due to the company's price increase, the Japanese "Central China Electric Communication Company" has dispatched representatives to negotiate with the Shanghai Telephone Company to increase the price of short-distance calls. The percentage of the increase is still under negotiation. In addition, the company originally charged a handling fee of 10 cents for transferring long-distance calls to other cities, but whether this will also increase in price is reportedly under consideration.

### US Warships Return to Shanghai, Japanese "Izumo" Sails to Nanjing

The U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, the Shanghai-based river gunboats USS Luzon and USS Guam, left port together early Tuesday morning (the 26th) to patrol the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, still berthed at the British and French naval pontoons off Yangjingbang. The flagship of the Japanese Navy's Third Fleet, the "Izumo," also left Shanghai at 1:50 PM on Tuesday and is reportedly heading to Nanjing, expected to stay in Nanjing for about a week before returning to Shanghai.

### Foreign Flour Orders Sold at 10% Discount, Shanghai Municipal Council Hopes for Same Treatment for Stockpiled Rice

The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), after consultation with the Fufeng and Fuxin flour mills, has been supplying subsidized flour daily since October 11, at 8,065 bags per day. The original price per bag from the factory was 17 yuan, but due to the increased cost of imported wheat, it was changed to 18 yuan per bag on the 25th of this month, plus a handling fee of 3 jiao for retail flour shops. It is now learned that the SMC, for further

Coordination Purposes

Specially sent letters yesterday through Mr. Marshall, Chairman of the Food Committee of the Bureau, to major foreign flour import firms in the city, requesting them to negotiate with their respective regular customers to offer one-tenth of their orders to major flour shops for subsidized sale at a price of 18 yuan per bag (the same as the price of flour factories in this street), plus a handling fee of 3 jiao. For the foreign flour that arrives, the major flour shops will be responsible for paying the price of 18 yuan per bag in advance. The foreign firms have agreed to the Bureau's proposal, and

Regular Customers of Foreign Flour

Have also generously cooperated. Retail flour is priced at 18 yuan and 3 jiao per bag, which is indeed high, but in order to prevent further price increases, offering a percentage of the orders for subsidized sale is quite proper. Now that rice prices are gradually rising, and people are struggling to make ends meet, various circles have heard the news and hope that the SMC will take similar measures for stockpiled rice.

### New French Consul General Inspects Police Station

Mazerat, accompanied by French Police Commissioner Lieutenant Colonel Fabreton, inspected the Lokawei Central Police Station and the General Administration, Political Department, Detective Department, and Vehicle Affairs Department.

### Japanese Residents of Wuchang Road Plot Self-Defense

According to the Shanghai Times, the Japanese-language "Continental Daily News" reported yesterday (the 27th) that the Shanghai Japanese Road Associations had recently organized self-defense groups. Only the Japanese residents of Wuchang Road, because they had not organized a road association, could not participate in the self-defense groups. However, the alleys and lanes around Wuchang Road are complex and crisscrossed, often used by terrorists and thieves to escape. Therefore, the Japanese residents of Wuchang Road will establish the Wuchang Road Japanese Association tonight (the 28th) and organize a self-defense committee, planning to send ten members every night to strictly guard and patrol the road.

### Conditions in Shaoxing After the Robbery

Residents of Shaoxing and Ningbo who detoured through Shipu to reach Shanghai reported that the Japanese army occupied Shaoxing this time, occupying the Yide pawnshop on Putijie (Bodhi Street) as its headquarters. The Japanese army entered the city on the 25th and was surrounded on the 28th, broke through the siege and fled to Keqiao. The Chinese army pursued and recovered Keqiao on the 29th. The Japanese retreated to Xiaoshan. The stores set on fire in the city were all in the busy areas of the main street, from Taoyuanchang west of the county bridge to Shuicheng Bridge, with more than 600 stores burned down, resulting in huge losses. Currently, in Shaoxing after the robbery, rice prices have soared, selling for 103 yuan per picul, and Erliu flour sells for 6 jiao and 8 fen per jin. Residents are eating Erliu flour to fill their stomachs, and rice is rarely seen. Only wealthy families can afford to taste it. The situation is too miserable to describe. It is hoped that Zhejiang organizations in Shanghai will raise funds to provide relief and assist the government in handling winter relief.

Ningbo Plague Eradicated

The Ningbo city area has discovered plague. Since the efforts of various epidemic prevention personnel, the epidemic has been eradicated. The relocation of various items in the area has now begun. It is learned that after registration by the registration section, many items have been relocated. The relocation sites are divided into three areas: (1) Kaiming Street, (2) Zhongshan East Road, (3) Donghou Street. In addition, the disinfection office organized by the epidemic prevention department is working day and night, which is quite intense.

### Civet Cats on the Road, Police Allowed to Shoot, For Fear of Spreading Rabies

At a meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Health Committee on the 20th of this month, the problem of rabies in the city was discussed. It was unanimously resolved to advise dog owners to voluntarily vaccinate their dogs against rabies to prevent transmission. However, the Bureau does not forcibly implement this measure. On the one hand, the Police Department is requested to step up the capture of stray dogs. In addition, civet cats often transmit rabies to dogs. In the future, civet cats will be allowed to be shot by police on the road to prevent this. Those who value hygiene and raise cats must pay attention to this. The case was approved by the SMC Board of Directors at its regular meeting on the 27th of this month.

### US Relief Supplies to China Shipped Monthly by Special Vessels, Donated Winter Clothing in Shanghai Not Accepted by Pawnshops

The American Red Cross officially announced on the 5th of this month that its Washington headquarters has decided to allocate several million US dollars to relieve refugees in the Chinese war zone. Relief supplies to Shanghai will be shipped monthly by a vessel, carrying various relief items, including 6,000 boxes of toys, which are expected to be shipped to Shanghai before this year's Christmas to be distributed to children. Medical supplies for free China, worth approximately 350,000 US dollars, were shipped from New York to Rangoon on the 6th of this month, expected to arrive in Rangoon in early December, and then transported to China via the Burma Road, to be distributed by Dr. Baker. As for the relief efforts in Shanghai, regarding the distribution of clothing,

Buddhist Association Presents to

Shanghai Municipal Council states, "Now that various philanthropists have entrusted us to make a large number of cotton clothes to distribute to the poor to help them get through the cold winter, most of the poor are unscrupulous, and after receiving the winter clothes, they either pawn or sell them to get money to use drugs, so they still feel cold, which is quite a letdown to the hard work of the donors. We will make the clothes in two colors (the body of the cotton-padded jacket and the sleeves will be gray and black, and the legs and crotch of the cotton-padded pants will be gray and black) to distinguish them, and we will add a stamp on the clothes to prohibit pawning or selling, so that the poor can truly benefit. Therefore, we prepare this document and respectfully ask you to examine it and order the Pawnbrokers Association to notify all pawnshops that the above-mentioned donated clothes shall not be accepted for pawning, and we also ask you to notify your affiliated police stations to pass the word to the police to check and prohibit pawning at any time to benefit the poor. This is truly a public convenience." Here is a transcript of the reply from Mr. Nash of the SMC Secretariat: "To the Shanghai Buddhist Association, greetings. We have received your letter of November 13 regarding the winter relief and the distribution of cotton clothes. Your work in relieving the poor is commendable. We have now notified the Police Department to pay special attention." The YMCA is also raising donations for winter clothes and has purchased cloth and cotton raw materials to start sewing. However, because labor costs are high this year, it is greatly affected. The Association is now soliciting charitable women from all walks of life to sew on a voluntary basis, and has established three methods: (1) sewing at the Association; (2) taking it home to sew; (3) donating wages of 5 jiao per set. The Association has detailed methods available for reference. Also, the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association

Sells White Rice at a Reduced Price

It has now selected the Qianye Guild Hall on Wenjian Shi Road as the first subsidized sales point, and Mr. Gu Yuanchang has been publicly elected as the director. The Second Subsidized Sales point will be at the Zhiyuan Dharma Assembly on Father Du Road, and Mr. Jin Baokun has been publicly elected as the director. Subsidized sales will begin on the 1st of next month, with a price of 1 jiao per market jin. Each person is limited to purchasing 3 market jin. This is truly good news for the poor in Shanghai.

The member money shops have fully subscribed to the capital and signed the reserve bank contract. The contract has eight conditions that must be strictly adhered to. The contract does not allow the stock to be mortgaged for loans and stipulates the distribution method of shareholder dividends. The bank is being prepared by Manager Liu Xichen and will open as soon as the new building is completed.

### Silver Car Not Sold, Yunfei Company Denies Purchase

Mr. Boroght, manager of the American Yunfei Motor Company in this port, yesterday denied rumors that his company will buy the Silver Car Company. He said that the two companies are completely independent of each other. The Silver cars seen in Yunfei's garage are there for repair, as Yunfei has a repair contract with Silver Car.

### Spitting Prohibited in the Bazi Bridge Market

The authorities of the Bazi Bridge Vegetable Market and the Health Department previously launched a week-long campaign to prohibit spitting, in the hope that those who come to the market will not spit everywhere. For this reason, 10,000 Chinese leaflets were distributed the previous week, explaining the dangers of not complying with the regulations and asking those who understand the cooperative benefits of this campaign to advise their relatives and friends to run the case. After this move, there has been some improvement, but further perfection is still needed. Therefore, the market authorities have decided to implement the final measure, that is, to strictly enforce the French concession's orders on this matter and impose a fine of 2 jiao on the spot for each instance of spitting.

### French Concession Tramway Machine Office Workers Provide Normal Service

According to the English-language China Press, the French Concession Tramway Company continued to work today (the 28th), and everything was as usual. The workers in the machine office recently raised 17 demands due to dissatisfaction with their allowances, and their representatives are prepared to meet with the company again to discuss the various demands. According to Mr. Flay, the manager of the tramway company, the situation today is quite calm, and there is no danger of another work slowdown. Labor and management representatives will discuss the entire relationship between the two sides. It is learned that the demands put forward by the workers include reducing working hours, providing allowances, and free schooling for workers' children. It is reported that none of these demands have been agreed upon, but the workers' demands have not specified a deadline for a response, so the company feels that a compromise can be negotiated and reached in the short term, and there will be no further disturbances.

### Rumor of Another US Loan to Aid China Highly Valued by US Citizens in Shanghai, Telephoned US State Department Yesterday to Inquire About Truth, Shanghai Financial Circles Quietly Awaiting Definite News

Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Hu Shih and financial and economic expert Song Ziwen jointly visited US Secretary of State Hull on the 26th to discuss the general situation in the Far East for 30 minutes. After this news reached Shanghai, Chinese and foreign people paid close attention. The nature of the progress of the issues discussed by Song Ziwen and Ambassador Hu in their meeting with Hull has not been revealed, but general observers believe that a large amount of assistance in

Aiding China

Must be one of the hearts of the discussion. Although the two Chinese officials did not express an opinion on the matter of another loan to China, another rumor said that China is expected to borrow at least $50 million in US loans. The financial community is paying close attention because some people believe that since the United States strengthened its policy toward the Far East, there is no problem in actively aiding China. The State Department's active withdrawal of expatriates in the Far East can prove this point. Yesterday, the commercial and financial circles in Shanghai aroused

Intense Excitement

Among them, they have been quietly awaiting news from the State Department in Washington regarding this aid-to-China message since yesterday. Some US expat New Voice News reporters have already telegraphed the State Department yesterday to inquire whether the United States has agreed to continue lending 20 million US dollars to the Chongqing Chinese government. Other US expat public organizations have also successively telegraphed the State Department to inquire about official aid-to-China loans. US expatriates in Shanghai are waiting quietly for the State Department's reply.

### The Fifth Lecture of the Rongwu Society: Elucidating the True Meaning of Meditation. Pastor Anderson Explains the Merits of Christianity. Buddhist Meditation (Dhyana) is Divided into Four Points.

In the fifth lecture of the Rongwu Lecture Society, Mr. Shen Daling first introduced American Pastor Anderson, who spoke about the similarities between Christianity and Confucianism. Mr. Lu Zhuoqiao then elaborated on Pastor Anderson's 26 years in China and his enthusiasm. Pastor Anderson then took the stage and delivered his speech in fluent Chinese, first humbly stating that he had little knowledge of Confucianism. He then spoke about his experiences with Christianity, highlighting three advantages. The first point is having a central belief, without disappointment even amidst various difficulties and hardships, allowing one to maintain their principles. The second point is having a definite direction, with an implicit guide leading to the goal. The third point is that regardless of the size of the position or the amount of salary, one must do their best. The audience applauded. In fact, the first point is Confucius's "not being perplexed and knowing destiny," the second point is Confucius's "stopping at perfect goodness," and the third point is Confucius's "revering affairs and eating afterward, being respectful in service, and being loyal to others." Then, Mr. Yang Zhongyi spoke about the fifth similarity between Confucianism and Buddhism, which is the fifth of the Six Paramitas, namely Dhyana Paramita. Dhyana in Chinese means "mindfulness cultivation," newly translated as "quiet contemplation," meaning that the mind is concentrated on one state without distractions. This is what the book Liezi refers to as "using the will without confusion, thereby concentrating on the spirit," which is focused attention. Buddhists call it "Dhyana," and Song Confucians call it "meditation." According to Buddhist scriptures and treatises, it is further divided into four items.

The Principle of Meditation

The Yuanjue Sutra says, "Undoubted pure wisdom is born from meditation." This is the meaning of the Great Learning's teaching that "knowing where to stop leads to stability, which leads to tranquility, which leads to peace, which leads to contemplation, and ultimately to attainment." The Zazen Yiqi (Principles of Zazen) says, "Transcending the ordinary and surpassing the saintly necessarily relies on quiet conditions. Sitting and escaping, standing and dying, must depend on the power of concentration." It also says, "To learn the Prajna Bodhisattva, one should diligently cultivate Samadhi. Samadhi is the stillness of the mind-essence, away from evil and chaos. The Great Learning speaks of cultivating the self by rectifying the mind, and the Doctrine of the Mean speaks of following one's nature by being cautious in solitude. The Analects speaks of the benevolent being tranquil, the Book of Odes speaks of having no impure thoughts, the Yi Jing speaks of 'Gen' (Keeping Still) as stopping the back, and even Meng Shishe's guarding of qi is not as good as Zeng Zi's guarding of simplicity, and Mencius's unmoved mind is different from Gaozi's unmoved mind."

The Method of Meditation

The Zazen Yiqi also says, "Release all connections, rest all affairs, body and mind as one, silence without gap, sit upright with the body straight, tongue touching the upper palate, lips and teeth touching, eyes slightly open. Once the body posture is fixed, the breath is regulated, relax the navel and abdomen, and do not think about anything, good or evil. When a thought arises, immediately be aware of it, and as soon as you are aware of it, it disappears. After a long time of forgetting connections, it naturally becomes one piece, and the four elements are light and comfortable, which is called the Dharma of Anle (peace and joy). At all times, protect the power of concentration as if protecting an infant. When the water of concentration is clear, the pearl of the mind will naturally appear. This fixed mind can produce the Dharma of wisdom." The meditation methods of the Song Confucians: the Cheng-Zhu school said, "Maintain reverence," which originated from the Book of Documents, "Those who are respectful win, those who are lazy lose." The Yi Jing's Qian trigram says, "The superior man is cautiously watchful all day." The Kun trigram says, "Reverence rectifies the inner." The Lu-Wang school said, "Maintain stillness," which originated from the Yi Jing's Gen trigram, "Keeping Still keeps his back," and the commentary says, "Keeping Still means stopping." This is the Chan school's "cutting off all appearances, emptying the mind, and having no good or evil." The Zhou-Shao school said, "Maintain observation," which originated from Laozi's "observing the subtleties," "observing the orifices," and "observing the return," also from the Yi Jing's Guan trigram, "observing life," and the Gan trigram, "observing sensation," which is the Tiantai school's "one mind, three observations – emptiness, falsehood, and the middle." Li Yannian would often sit silently, purifying his mind to experience the state before emotions arose, which Zhu Xi called the "secret transmission of the Guishan school."

The Benefits of Meditation

The Yue Deng Sanwei Sutra says, "The Buddha said, if a Bodhisattva abides in secluded sitting, there are ten kinds of benefits," and ultimately "attaining the Four Unimpeded Wisdoms." Also, the Buddha said, "If a Bodhisattva loves solitude, there are ten kinds of benefits," and ultimately "less effort is needed to attain Samadhi." The Doctrine of the Mean says, "The way of utmost sincerity can foreknow; therefore, utmost sincerity is like a god." The Yi Jing's Xici commentary says, "Without thought, without action, still and unmoving, it responds and penetrates all the affairs of the world. Who can participate in this if not one who possesses the utmost sincerity in the world?" The Zhizhe Great Master's "adjusting the body, adjusting the breath, and adjusting the mind" are explained in detail in the "Tiantai Zhi Guan." Its effect of removing obstacles and curing diseases is described in the "Buddhist Patriarchs' Chronicle." As for the Shurangama Sutra's saying "the Dao embryo has been formed" and the Avatamsaka Sutra's saying "the Tathagata appears," then "the work is accomplished and the embryo is formed." The function of meditation is complete.

The Harm of Non-Meditation

The Buddha's Testament Sutra contains the precept against "indulgence in the five desires," and the Yuanjue Sutra contains the warning "where will the deluded body be?" Both speak of the harm of not knowing Dhyana. The Dao cannot be separated from one for even a moment. "What is preserved in man, if day and night it is shackled and lost," then one is tempted by material desires, and "man is transformed into an object," "sinking and drowning the mind." If one does not know to seek release, drifts and forgets to return, then it is like "pulling up seedlings to help them grow, and harming them instead." Therefore, Mencius "seeks to release the lost mind, attains innate knowledge, preserves the night qi, cultivates the vast righteousness, and reaches the unmoved mind."

### Abandoning Wife After Contracting a Terrible Disease, Cohabitating with a Dancer

Xu Yilei, the owner of the Xie Xing Lumber Company in Ningbo, has a son named Meikun, who is currently 26 years old. In 1934, he married Qian Lianqi (currently 24 years old), a local woman, through a matchmaker. They had a son after marriage, who is now six years old. However, Xu Meikun enjoyed promiscuity and did not engage in proper work. As a result of seeking pleasure, he contracted a terrible disease. Qian also became infected, leading to a deterioration in their marital relationship. Through the mediation of lawyer Wu Linkun, they signed a separation agreement on October 1, 1936, stipulating that the separation period would be one year. Xu Meikun would pay Qian a monthly living allowance of 150 yuan and bear the medical expenses for treating her disease. Cohabitation would only resume if Xu Meikun's disease was completely cured and he had a normal job. However, after the couple separated, Xu Meikun became an unbridled horse. He met a dancer from the Weigong Dance Hall named Li (currently 25 years old), who was from Ningbo. In October 1938, he began cohabitating with her, first building a "golden house" in Taoyuanfang, North Henan Road, and then moving to No. 30, Fulu Lane, No. 814, Haining Road. Xu, having found new love, stopped paying Qian the agreed-upon monthly allowance, leaving her alone in her mother's home at No. 103 Zhangjiazhai, Aiwunyi Road. Recently, Qian discovered Xu's secret and reported it to the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Station. Chinese Detective Liang Yuliang requested a search warrant from the Special First Court. On the morning of the 13th, at 5:45 AM, he went and arrested the pair of "wild mandarin ducks." Because they had a fixed residence, they were not detained. In the morning, the Special First Court, based on the police station's request, summoned both parties. Police lawyer Fang Fushu prosecuted them for adultery under Article 239 of the Criminal Law, stating that the plaintiff had said at the police station that she had heard rumors for over a year and had only recently discovered their exact address. However, Xu Qian denied ever saying at the police station that she had heard rumors a year ago, saying that she had only learned the truth less than a month ago.

Requesting Severe Punishment

When questioned, both defendants did not deny the adultery. They also stated that Li had given birth to a daughter this year and that they had been cohabitating for so long that the plaintiff must have heard about it. Fang, based on the plaintiff's statement at the police station that she had heard rumors a year ago, believed that there was a degree of condoning and ruled that the plaintiff's case was not accepted. It is said that Qian was dissatisfied with the ruling and will appeal to the police station to file a high suit.

Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association Decides to Collectively Purchase Rice at a Fixed Price

### Racecourse Road Kidnapping Case: Inside-Job Leads to Kidnapping. Luo Ahai and One Kidnapper Detained.

Chuan Qilun, owner of the Lao Yongsen Leather Shop at No. 54 Singapore Road, lived at No. 18, Lane 69, Racecourse Road. At 7:10 AM the other morning, four kidnappers suddenly broke in, carrying weapons, and snatched Chuan's two-year-old son, Yiping. However, as soon as they left the lane entrance, the child's crying attracted the attention of passersby. A pedestrian named Xu Shourong, who lived on Laguna Road in the French Concession and worked at the Wu Jinchang Tailor Shop on Tongfu Road every morning, witnessed the scene and assisted in the pursuit. The Chengdu Road Police Station, upon receiving the alarm, immediately dispatched Chinese Detective Shao Jingfan, Chen Yonggui, and Detective Tian Changchun to the scene. They apprehended one of the kidnappers, Yu Gendi, from Shaoxing, on the spot and rescued the child. The remaining kidnappers fled. He was taken to the police station. Under questioning, Yu admitted that he and the fugitives, surnamed Pan, Chen, and Mao A'mei, were accomplices. It was discovered that Mao A'mei worked as a "hug platform" at the Hexi Peace Gambling House. Luo Ahai, the old clerk of the Lao Yongsen Leather Shop, originally leaked information, revealing the family situation of Chuan Qilun, the owner, and all the equipment in the house. Mao, Pan, Chen, Yu, and others then discussed the kidnapping procedures. It was agreed that if the kidnapping was successful, the ransom would be 50,000 yuan, of which Luo would get 5,000 yuan, and the remaining funds would be divided equally among them. Based on the confession, the detectives arrested Luo Ahai. Yesterday, they were both brought before the criminal court of the Special First Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the above situation and requested approval for detention. Witness Xu Shourong also complained about his situation in helping to pursue and capture the kidnapper Yu Gendi. After Judge Liu briefly questioned the two defendants, he ordered them to be detained for seven days for further verification.

### Two Groups of Robbers Sentenced

Bao and Qian reported that at approximately 9 AM on the 20th of this month, while transporting 5,000 yuan, they were robbed at the entrance of No. 29 Beijing Road. Yu Yingguang and Zhang Jinglu were arrested at the time. A pistol was found on them. Later, another pistol, which Yu and others had discarded, was found in the China Garden. They were interrogated and detained by the Special First Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefei held another hearing. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that one of the two guns held by the defendants was found to have been stolen from the French Police Department in March and requested permission to return it to the French Police Department. When questioned, the two defendants confessed to the robbery without denying it. The court sentenced Yu to seven years in prison and Zhang to six years in prison. One gun was confiscated, and the other was returned to the French Police Department.

### Guohua Invents Mechanical Shoe Eyelets

The shoe eyelets on ordinary leather and canvas shoes, though small, have a wide range of uses. All the shoe stores in our country use imported products. The annual consumption is quite astonishing. Because the manufacturing process of this type of shoe eyelet is very complicated, no Chinese has yet established a factory to manufacture them. Mr. Hu Xianghua has accumulated more than ten years of experience and research, and he has repeatedly tested and obtained satisfactory results. Mr. Hu has now opened the Guohua Hardware Industrial Factory in Jintang Village, Xujiahui Road, specializing in manufacturing shoe eyelets to promote domestic products and recover lost profits.

### Mrs. Zou Chengding's Memorial Service

Mrs. Lu Xiongzhen, the first wife of Mr. Zou Chengding, secretary of the Political Department of the French Police Station, died of illness at the Shanghai Maternity Hospital at Yinshi (3-5 AM) on September 28th of this year. Mr. Zou has chosen December 1st of the Gregorian calendar to hold a memorial service for his wife at the Shanghai Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. Mr. Zou has a wide circle of friends, and Mr. Zou's relatives and friends will all go to express their condolences at that time.

### The General Situation of the Five Major Cultural Undertakings of the Catholic Church in China (2)

The cataloging of the Xuhui Library is still based on the Siku Quanshu method, divided into Classics, History, Philosophy, and Belles-Lettres, with Collection as its supplement. The detailed entries are also classified according to the Siku Quanshu classification. The catalog has books, with the number of strokes in the last character of each book as an index. There is also a card catalog, divided into three types: book name, author name, and category. According to statistics, there are about 200,000 volumes each of Chinese and Western books. Western books are mostly in Latin and French. The cataloging of Western books is roughly the same as that of Chinese books, with books and cards, and the cataloging method is based on the following categories, with Latin letters as an index: Bible, Saints, Church Law, Theology, Church Ritual, Catechism, Church Resolutions, Church History, Biography, Literature, Science, History and Geography, Sinology, Newspapers and Magazines, Series, and Jesuit Books. Each category is further divided into detailed items for easy searching.

The goal of the Xuhui Library's collection is only to facilitate the research of clergymen, so the facilities are simple and the staff is lacking, making it difficult to open to the public. Initially, there was no intention to form a library, but over time, the collection became magnificent. Since the purpose is to promote cultural exchange, Western books are rich in history and Chinese books are rich in geography, so the Xuhui Library has become a general library. However, scholars are welcome to visit the library for reference with a letter of introduction from a friend. In recent years, the library's storage space has become insufficient, and many people have advocated opening it to the public. However, due to a lack of funds, the new building has not been completed, which is a great pity. During this war, 50-60% of Chinese books were destroyed, and the number of books burned and looted is even harder to count. Although the Xuhui Library is located on an isolated island and has been preserved, this can be a great comfort to those throughout the country who love the library. However, how to expand and develop this library, open it to the public, and fulfill the responsibility of revitalizing national culture remains to be guided and supported by people throughout the country.

The purpose of establishing the Xuhui Library's collection was to research academics. The Hanxue Series is a major expression of research achievements.

### Yunnan Education Department Announces the Current Situation of Education in the Province (1) Education in All Provinces Has Made Progress

(Kunming Correspondent) Yunnan Education in the past year, due to the establishment of administrative policies, the increase in funding sources, the enrichment of material facilities, the closeness of facility programs, and the concentration of practitioners, has made positive progress in higher education, secondary education, primary education, and social education. The Education Department has specially announced various statistics, and the outline is recorded as follows:

Higher Education

The Private Donglu University has added colleges and departments, enriched the content of equipment, and suggested changing it to a national university with increased annual funding to lay a solid foundation for higher education. This year, it also revised the scholarship system for outstanding students in university and specialized courses, expanding the number from 200 to 1,000, and increasing the amount from more than 60,000 yuan to 300,000 yuan in new currency. There are 709 students going to universities and specialized courses in China, most of whom tend to value practical subjects, and the ratio with liberal arts is no longer too different. In the future, in order to make the development of various talents balanced, and to strengthen the cultivation, from this year onwards, in addition to ordinary scholarships, there will also be special department scholarships, specifically used to encourage the study of disciplines that are needed in the province or are lacking. In terms of the number of students in higher education, compared with previous years, it is slightly less, but compared with advanced provinces and regions, it is still much inferior. In the future, it is planned to find ways to encourage students from Yunnan who hope to go to university and specialized courses to reach one-fifteenth of the total number of middle school students in the province (that is, about 1,000).

Secondary Education

Secondary education is one of the main facilities of local education in the province. In the past year, there were a total of 146 public and private secondary schools in the province, with 524 classes and 25,691 students, including 22,668 boys and 3,023 girls (accounting for one-eighth of the total). This year, the number of graduates was 5,308, the number of faculty and staff was 2,139, and the funding was 2,841,165 yuan in new currency. The types of settings are divided into three items: ordinary middle schools set up for college preparatory, normal schools for training primary school teachers, and secondary vocational schools for training agriculture, industry, commerce, and home affairs. Among them, the important statistics of ordinary middle schools this year are 91 schools, including 19 middle schools jointly established with high and junior high schools, and 72 junior high schools, with 18,456 students, including 2,249 high school students and 16,207 junior high school students (2,197 girls, accounting for a little over one-eighth of the total). The number of graduates this year was 3,976, and the number of faculty and staff was 1,382 (including 118 female teachers). The funding was 1,699,291 yuan in new currency. There are 41 normal schools, including 11 regular normal schools, 29 simple normal schools, and 116 classes, including 40 regular normal classes, with 5,366 students, including 1,750 regular normal students and 3,616 simple normal students (141 girls). There were 967 graduates, 500 faculty and staff (21 female). The funding was 712,438 yuan. There are 14 vocational schools, including 1 senior agricultural school, 4 junior agricultural schools, a total of 5 schools, 1 senior industrial school, 2 junior industrial schools, a total of 3 schools, 2 commercial schools, 3 nursing and midwifery schools, and 1 home affairs school, with 53 classes and 1,869 students (29 girls). There were 365 graduates, 257 faculty and staff (32 female). The funding was 424,366 yuan. Judging from the above statistics, the number of normal schools is relatively considerable, but the vocational item is too small. The provincial education department plans to expand it next year. The number of girls attending school only accounts for one-eighth of the total, and efforts should be made to promote and encourage girls to attend school. In the future, the main points of setting up schools should focus on senior high schools, female education, vocational education, teacher education, the balanced development of various regions, mutual adjustment with other public and private secondary schools, the selection of teacher candidates, and the content of equipment.

### Education Briefs

Luo Zhongshu, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts of West China University, has recently returned from England.

### Rats Among the People

— Nai Liu

Cheng, a child in the second grade of elementary school, hates rats and knows that rats bring no benefit to mankind. Then, a grown person must know even more about the harm rats cause! Rats not only gnaw and destroy clothes and food, but they can also cause fires and bring disease to humans. If we calculate the losses caused by rats to people in monetary terms alone, then the national loss must be in the tens of thousands, not including the loss of lives and the pain of illness!

However, generally speaking, common people have an almost blind respect for rats. For example, if something is gnawed by rats, they simply admit their bad luck and never think of saying anything; sometimes, when they do speak, they always avoid the word "rat" because, according to them, if they blame "Uncle Rat" for damaging their things, then "Uncle Rat" will cause them even greater losses when he starts fires. This attitude of respecting rats while keeping them at a distance is simply baffling.

Analyzing the reason for this "respect" for rats, I think it is simply because people feel they "can't do anything about it." Because nighttime is when people are dreaming peacefully, who wants to stay up all night interfering with the rats' actions? Once it's daytime, they hide in their holes, and it's impossible to interfere. Under these circumstances, ordinary people simply let the rats take free rein, praying in their hearts that the rats won't cause them too much damage! But in reality, how would rats understand your sincerity!

Living beings are always in competition, and those who fail will be eliminated. Everyone should have a fundamental understanding of rats and muster the courage to fight them. (After reading, "Expanding the Rat Extermination Campaign")

### Frozen Corpses on the Road

— Han Ru

One evening in early winter, the north wind was blowing fiercely, and on the cold and desolate Singapore Road, a large crowd gathered in front of the pawnshop.

"Alright! The corpse hasn't been carried away yet, give us twenty dollars, or we'll drag it back in!" A "police officer" in a black uniform demanded from the pawnshop clerks. (It turned out that a group of gangsters, in collusion with several "police officers," dragged a corpse from the street and laid it across the pawnshop threshold, planning to extort money.)

"Fellow countrymen, please help us, our boss isn't here, we can't make decisions," one of the shop clerks pleaded with the "police officer."

"Hey! You're really ignorant! Just cough up twenty dollars, easy peasy, you mama!" The man, wearing his hat askew and draped in a serge overcoat, spoke in a Jiangbei accent, glaring at the clerk, while the others in the shop just stared blankly.

"Go! Go! What's there to see?" A sharp voice cut through the crowd, and people parted slightly to make way for a man followed by two scruffy fellows. Clearly, this man wanted to remove the corpse.

"Where's the corpse?" the man asked the crowd.

"What are you planning to do with it?" a "police officer" asked the man.

"Just take it away, that's all."

"That's not allowed! Come with me." The "police officer" pulled him aside.

"What's up? Extortion?"

"You bastard trying to extort money, this twenty dollars is for the guys on duty, my brother won't take a penny from you."

"Is twenty dollars enough to make it clean?"

"Yes! Hurry up, now."

The man immediately gave the "police officer" twenty dollars. In an instant, several "police officers" were busy, some gangsters brought ropes and others brought ashes, and they wrapped up the corpse. Then everyone scattered. But the matter wasn't over yet, the "police officer" started reaching out to the pawnshop again.

"Alright! Nothing more to see here, for the guys on duty..."

"Didn't you say twenty dollars covered everything? What's this about duty? I ask you, are they on duty or are they extortionists?"

"Old friend, don't say that, they each make a few dollars, not even enough to eat, you think about it."

"Ah! This is really..."

So another five dollars was given, and only then was the matter settled. The pawnshop spent fifteen dollars, the stone threshold was blackened by the long bar of silver, and there seemed to be no other traces. They closed up shop.

Huo Sang Detective Cases

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 12: Report and Explanation

Huo Sang said to me, "Bao Lang, do you remember the pair of darkened leather shoes in the closet in Miss Lan's bedroom that you tried to wipe clean? Originally, that towel had two uses: one was for wiping knives, and the other was for wiping leather shoes." He wrapped the knife up again in the same way and placed it on Ni Jinshou's desk. "Songquan, continue."

The detective nodded and continued, "When I came back from that alley, the old man had already passed several shops, and the two suspicious men had approached him, so I was actually behind them. But to be careful, I didn't want to rush ahead of them. But the old man walked to a post office entrance and went inside, and the two men lingered outside. Although I couldn't follow him in, this delayed me for about twenty minutes. The old man came out of the post office, and the two men were still following him closely. I had no choice but to stay behind. The old man continued walking, heading towards Datong Road. After entering Datong Road, the four of us maintained the same order as before. I knew these two men had bad intentions. I planned to wait until the old man entered his house on Qingpu Road before dealing with these two men. Unexpectedly, as we approached the corner of Qingpu Road, the two men suddenly attacked, clearly intending to rob him. At that time, I was still three or four yards away from them, and I was about to step forward to intervene when suddenly two shots rang out, and the old man fell on the corner. The two men also turned and fled. These two men brushed past me. If I had stopped them, I could have at least captured one person. But since these two men hadn't noticed me, I decided to simply follow them, thinking I might get better results. They hired two rickshaws at the corner of the north side of Datong Road. Of course, I also took a rickshaw to follow them. They only got out near the Wenmiao Road in the Western District and walked into a thatched house without a door number.

"I identified the location and went to report to the nearby Western District Police Station. District Chief Yang immediately sent four officers with pistols to the thatched house with me. We entered the hut, and the two men were still inside. The one in the Western suit pulled out his pistol, wanting to resist. But we were quicker, and he didn't have time. So we didn't spend much effort and captured a total of four people: one woman and three men.

"We brought these four people back to the Western District Police Station, and District Chief Yang immediately interrogated them. At first, of course, they refused to talk, but after a little trouble, the man in the Western suit told the truth. Their purpose was very simple. They saw the old man exchange a lot of cash in the jewelry store and wanted to rob him. But in the end, they were unsuccessful. They wasted two bullets and just made the old man suffer."

Hearing this, Huo Sang nodded a few times, indicating that he was very satisfied with the report. (180)

### Dreams and Dreams

— Su Nong

Mrs. Li had a dream again last night, so early in the morning, she excitedly went to "report" it to Mrs. Zhang next door: "Mrs. Zhang! I have good news for you. Last night, I had the same two dreams: I saw the house full of light, and a lot of mice jumping out of the light. Oh, what do you think of betting on 'Fu Sang'?"

"Really? No wonder I see your face full of red light. Didn't you dream of fire? Fire is red, and red is a 'sign' of wealth! Rats, yes, yes, bet on 'Fu Sang'! It's sure to hit! Definitely!" Mrs. Zhang said encouragingly. Because she knew that if she participated in the decision, she would always be able to get some "oil."

"Then, I'll definitely bet a dollar on it. If it hits, I'll treat you!"

As soon as Mrs. Zhang heard "treat," her eyebrows danced with joy. "I'm saying it's a sure thing, Mrs. Li, what will you treat me to?"

"How about treating you to crabs?"

"Good, good! But I'm really embarrassed, again..." She imagined eating the crab, imagining how to use the tip of the crab's small leg to pick out a piece of crab roe, then dipping it in vinegar, and then... she swallowed a mouthful of saliva.

So Mrs. Li's only dollar in her pocket immediately "flew" into the hands of "Little Pockface." Because if she was late, she was afraid she wouldn't catch up with the "early post."

"Little Pockface" was the "Hui runner" that everyone in this alley knew. He could get some "dividends" from the winner; as for losing, that was naturally none of his business!

Mrs. Zhang simply stayed in Mrs. Li's room waiting to eat crabs. Mrs. Li was "planning" how to spend the other half of the money besides treating her guest. She thought of buying a few handkerchiefs, buying a piece of clothing material; she also thought of buying two pounds of meat and cooking a big pot of rice to eat her fill; she also wanted to buy...

Mrs. Li smiled. Mrs. Zhang also smiled.

A few minutes later, a familiar sound of footsteps seemed to be approaching, and entered the room!

Their hearts immediately became tense: it was longing, it was fear.

But "Little Pockface" finally poked his head in and said, "Mrs. Li, the 'result' is out!" and quickly withdrew.

Mrs. Li suddenly stood up and cursed, "Dead rat, plague rat! Coming to make fun of me! Next time I see it, I'll kill it all!" And so, just now, the handkerchiefs, clothing material, meat, big pot of rice... all turned into dreams.

She slumped and opened the box, and took out a piece of clothing from inside. Of course, after a while, it would be lying comfortably in the "safe."

What about Mrs. Zhang? She also seemed to have had a "crab eating dream." She sighed listlessly, "If I had known, one dollar would have been enough to buy two crabs!" She couldn't help swallowing a mouthful of saliva. Mrs. Li sighed. Mrs. Zhang also sighed...

"Next time, don't tell me about your dreams..." Mrs. Zhang "warned" Mrs. Li like this.

### Recent Events in the Foreign Arts Scene

— Xin Fang

(1)

American movie star Van Johnson, in late October, broadcast a speech in London, saying that the friendship between the British and American people is growing stronger every day. He said: "The entire staff of Hollywood, whether actors or technicians, all love to listen to Churchill's speeches, and also express great respect for the British King."

(2)

It is heard that there will no longer be any traces of American films in Germany and its occupied territories, including the Czech Republic, Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. In particular, the productions of MGM, Paramount, and 20th Century Fox are absolutely prohibited.

The German military authorities issued the following statement: "This ban does not apply to the entire American film industry, but only to target film merchants who harbor hostility towards Germany."

(3)

A cinema in Milan, Italy, recently showed a German newsreel. When it reached the middle, someone suddenly shouted in the darkness, "Long live Belgium!" At that time, the lights were turned on, but they could not find the person who shouted; later, the lights went out, and after continuing to screen for a few minutes, someone shouted again. As a result, they had to stop the screening. It is said that what was being shown was a newsreel depicting the German army's occupation of Belgium.

(4)

Since Japan's war against China has fallen into a quagmire, the people are eager to end the war, and even their emotions are negative and unbearable! In order to inspire the people, the government has recently instructed domestic radio stations to broadcast the first program at 5:30 AM, which is the blowing of the reveille. This is the first time this has happened in Japanese history.

### Trends in the Old Capital's Performing Arts Scene

— Xique

Zhang Junqiu, one of the four famous young Dan actors, was married on the 23rd at Fushoutang. The bride, Zhao Yurong, is very beautiful and can be called a perfect couple with Zhang. Mao Shilai is performing at the Tianjin Chinese Grand Theater, and specially sent a letter to Zhang Junqiu to congratulate him and apologize for not being able to attend the wedding in person. According to Mao Shilai, his wedding date is on the third of the month, at which time Zhang Junqiu happened to be performing in Tianjin, and could not attend Mao's wedding.

After the "Chinese Advanced Opera School" closed down, the theater affairs director Shen Sanyu tried to raise funds to take over, but after running around, everyone said that the opera school's budget required a monthly loss, so no one was willing to invest, and the landlord would take back the property. It was also very difficult to find another school site for a while, so it was unsuccessful. Currently, the students of the Jade class have been issued graduation certificates by the school. Among them, the only outstanding talent, Li Yuru, has decided to form a troupe to perform, inviting Zhao Jinnian, He Yuqin, Chu Jinpeng, etc. to cooperate (that is, those who often played supporting roles at school). They will go to Shanghai next spring to fulfill the golden agreement.

Yan Jupeng's daughter, Huizhu, has been invited by Zhang Baoru, the resident representative of the Shanghai Xin Xin Stage. It has been decided that she will go to Shanghai at the beginning of next month to perform after Li Wanchun.

Wu Sheng Zhang Yunxi, who performed in Shanghai last winter at the same time as Zhang Yun, was engaged to the younger sister of Chi Shigong (who was recently hired by Shanghai Xin Xin at the same time as Wu Suoqiu). It is heard that they will get married this winter. (Sent from Beijing on the 14th)

(15) Sending the Phoenix Crown

This is a scene from "A Section in the Jasper Kui." The scholar Wang Yulin, using his ears as eyes, suspected that his wife—Li Xiuying—had an affair with someone. On the night of their wedding, he humiliated her in every way! Miss Li suffered mental pain because of this.

Later, the truth came to light, and Wang Yulin returned home in glory. Miss Li, believing that a heartless man could not share wealth, refused the imperial honor! Later, after Yulin expressed remorse and personally sent the phoenix crown; and with Wang's mother repeatedly begging for mercy for her son, the situation finally eased. She asked to take a maid as a concubine, and she herself would only be the nominal wife.

I have seen Cheng Yanqiu perform this in Peking opera, but the surnames of the characters in the play are different: Wang Yulin is Zhao Qixian, and Li Xiuying is Zhang Yuzhen. Unofficial history is not official history after all, and we don't need to examine which is true. (See picture)

(16) Crying at the Coffin

There is a scene in Yue opera called "Crying at the Coffin," which is Pan Jinlian crying for Wu Dalang.

Wu Dalang's death was caused by Pan Jinlian's poison. Then it seems irrational for Pan Jinlian to cry for Wu Dalang. I think the cat crying for the mouse must not have real tears; in fact, Pan Jinlian's crying is real crying. She is using the occasion of "crying at the coffin" to also cry for her own life.

Chats About the Calligraphy World

### Casual Talk on "Jiang Zhu"

— Ye Jiale

Radio shows dedicated to storytelling always feature "Jiang Zhu," which shows that they have a strong appeal. "Jiang Zhu" is the abbreviation of Jiang Ruting and Zhu Jiesheng, who are now standard storytelling partners. Their reputation is on par with "Shen Xue," Zhu Zhao, and other double acts, but in terms of storytelling skills, they are unsurpassed. Let me talk about their storytelling skills:

Jiang Ruting Because of his ugly appearance, his voice is surprisingly good, so he has won the elegant nickname "West Shi Behind the Wall." His storytelling style is concise and clear, without any scattered or messy flaws. The narrative is in a grand style and is full of scholarly atmosphere. His voice is very sweet, and singing a few sentences is charming, like the famous Peking opera singer Ma Lianliang. His jokes are elegant and not vulgar, definitely not comparable to the blind head-scratching of ordinary "comedians." His character portrayals in the stories are all meticulously portrayed, with vivid expressions. He can tell stories such as "Luo Jin Shan," "Yu Ding," and "San Xiao," especially "Luo Ling Shan" is his best, and the most appealing. Looking at the above, his popularity can last for a long time, which is definitely not without reason.

Zhu Jiesheng is the son of the veteran Tan Ci performer Zhu Yaoting. His appearance is handsome and elegant, with the demeanor of a noble young master. His storytelling skills are completely derived from his family education, so of course they are extraordinary. His signature story is "Shuang Zhu Feng," which is quite unique, but since partnering with Jiang Ruting, this story is not often sung in the storytelling world. His Yu tune is second to none in the current Guangyu Society. The opening songs such as "Gong Yuan" and "Ye Shen Xiao Xiang Guan" resound through the clouds, melodious and pleasant. His expressions and character portrayals are best at Sheng and Dan, while Jing and Chou are not his strengths. Jiang Ruting is a good match for him, truly a green leaf to the peony, complementing each other. Their future is optimistic.
