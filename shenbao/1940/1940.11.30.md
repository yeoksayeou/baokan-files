### Song Ziwen Meets with Morse Yesterday: China and the United States to Establish New Loans, China Continues to Order Large Amounts of Military Supplies in the United States, Totaling Over US$11 Million

Washington – According to news from here last night, Mr. Song Ziwen will meet with Mr. Bills, the director of the Export-Import Bank, and Mr. Jones, the chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, today. Therefore, all parties believe that the United States is about to grant another loan to China. American officials pointed out that the exact decision on the new loan will be made after some time. A Chinese source said that the current talks in Washington involve the possibility of the United States seeking to purchase a large quantity of goods from China within one or two years. This news is largely consistent with the statement issued by Mr. Jones. Some sources say that a new loan to China may be established tomorrow. It is generally believed that if the new loan to China is delayed, the United States may take other measures, possibly involving further embargoes against Japan, as an expression of opposition to Japan’s recognition of the "Nanjing Government." (United Press Agency dispatch on the 29th)

Washington – The U.S. Department of State announced yesterday that the delivery of military aircraft to the United Kingdom and Canada increased significantly in mid-October, and China has also continued to purchase large quantities of military supplies recently. The total value of American aircraft received by the United Kingdom in October was US$10,177,776, while the total value of American aircraft received by the United Kingdom in the first nine months of this year was US$50,424,018. The value of American aircraft received by Canada in October was US$1,929,333. The total value of American military supplies imported into the United Kingdom in mid-October was US$20,892,000. China has obtained export licenses for American military supplies worth US$957,000 in mid-October. Most of these military supplies are explosives and powerful bombs. In the ten months of this year, the total value of military equipment allowed for export in the military equipment export licenses obtained by China is US$11,597,000, most of which are aircraft and aircraft parts. In mid-October, the U.S. government did not issue any licenses allowing military supplies to be transported to Japan. The State Department also stated that in mid-October, it also issued licenses to allow the shipment of military supplies to the Dutch East Indies. The total value of the military supplies allowed to be shipped is US$1,116,000, of which armored vehicles account for US$8,649,000. The State Department also pointed out that the issuance of licenses only means that the goods can be shipped, and does not mean that the goods have actually been shipped. The licenses obtained by Thailand in this month are for the shipment of aircraft engines worth US$344,887, but the country did not obtain a single license in October. Australia obtained export licenses for aircraft engines worth US$1,314,250 in mid-October, and it has obtained export licenses for military equipment worth US$5,238,000 in the ten months of this year.

### Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee George Will Visit England; After the New Congress Opens in January Next Year, He Will Take Concrete Action to Assist Britain

Washington – The remarks made by British Ambassador to the United States Lothian regarding Britain’s needs seem to have been very successful if he can promptly raise the issue of increasing aid to Britain to the American public. Congressional newspapers and private individuals are all using this as a basis for debate. It is generally believed that Britain is fighting not only for itself but also for the United States, so the United States will definitely provide assistance when necessary. The influential Washington Post stated that Britain has not yet reached the point of being completely bankrupt, but the British have to statistically calculate their resources based on the theory that the war of attrition will be protracted. For the sake of careful military planning, all their credit and assets are mobilized. If Britain can foresee that what it purchases in the United States can be obtained on credit from the United States, then its war plan can certainly be more thorough and have greater confidence. What is the answer of the United States to this? There is no doubt that when considering the appropriate time for the loan, the United States will definitely fully agree to it. The statement made by Senator George, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, that he personally supports aid to Britain and will discuss it with the head of the administration can be regarded as implying that concrete action will be taken after the new Congress opens in January next year. Unconfirmed news: George will fly to England to visit British Prime Minister Churchill and other important figures. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)

Washington – Official sources revealed that the U.S. government has allowed Britain to deliver an average of 600 warplanes to Britain per month over the next two years.

### Hubei Army Gains Victory; Li Jiadang and Xianju are Recaptured One After Another; Japanese Attempt to Break Through East of Dahong Mountain Fails

Yicheng – About 5,000 Japanese troops, who invaded the northwest of Jingmen from the east bank of the Xiang River, ventured into Xianju, Li Jiadang and other places. The Chinese army used the dangerous mountainous roads to seize the opportunity to surround the Japanese army. Starting from dawn on the 27th, they launched a fierce attack on them. By night, they had recaptured Li Jiadang. On the 28th, they continued to recapture Xianju. It is estimated that more than 3,000 Japanese troops were killed. The remaining Japanese troops broke through and fled in defeat. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue fiercely, and completely cleared out the remaining Japanese troops from south of Kuaihuo Shop to the Hujiaji area, seizing countless spoils of war, which are being counted. The Japanese troops who attacked the area north of Huangjiaji from Dangyang were severely defeated by the Chinese army, and the Japanese army was defeated and retreated. (Telegram on the 29th)

### The Whole Line of Japanese Troops in Central and Northern Hubei Retreats After Being Defeated

Chongqing – The winter offensive launched by the Japanese troops in northern and central Hubei has entered a stage of victory for the Chinese army by the morning of the 29th, and the Japanese army has been frustrated. If they do not retreat quickly, they will again fall into a major defeat. Regarding the harassment of the Japanese army and the annihilation by the Chinese army, a military expert recently told a Central News Agency reporter in detail as follows: The Japanese troops trapped on both sides of the Xiang River began to move on the 24th of this month. In northern Hubei, some Japanese troops gathered a large number of troops from Maping and Danhe in Suixian and attacked the Wanshan area in separate groups. After the Chinese army calmly responded and counterattacked separately, the entire Japanese line was defeated to the south and retreated to the Jinjishan-Kuaihuo Ridge area. On the 27th, the Japanese army reinforced from Suixian again, attempting to attack. The Chinese army dispatched troops on the 28th to drive one of their groups to Tangjiachong and another group to Duanjiawan to carry out individual annihilation, killing a large number of them. There are no Japanese troops in the Jinjishan area now. Another group of Japanese troops on the east bank of the Xiang River attacked the Changshoudian area near the west foothills of Dahong Mountain from Zhongxiang, and suffered heavy casualties after repeated fierce attacks by the Chinese army. On the 27th, the Japanese army launched a counterattack again in two routes. The elite troops of the Chinese army in the Bianzhai-Sanhe area began to counterattack the Japanese army on the morning of the 28th. The Japanese army was caught off guard and suffered heavy losses, and fled in defeat. The Chinese army is continuing to pursue them. As for the west bank of the Xiang River, the Japanese army advanced northward from the Dangyang-Jingmen-Zhaxihe line on the 24th. The Chinese army had made thorough arrangements early, so it lured the Japanese army to penetrate deeply. The Japanese army indeed advanced fiercely in one group to the area north of Huangjiaji, harassed Miaobian in one group, and attempted to attack Yangjiazhai in one group. The Chinese army saw that the Japanese forces were dispersed, and each group had entered the Chinese encirclement, so it began a full-scale fierce attack. The Japanese army's retreat routes were all cut off by the Chinese army. By the morning of the 29th, the entire Japanese army had collapsed and fled south. The Japanese army suffered heavy losses in the campaign, and the Chinese army achieved great results. At the beginning of the Japanese army's move, they claimed that the Chinese army was preparing to attack, and the Japanese army only controlled the Chinese army's opportunity first and made advance cover-up. The failure this time means that the Japanese have become exhausted. No matter how much they bluff and bluster, they are outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and the result is no more than the previous Jiacheng campaign and the Zhusheng campaign, watching them fall into the trap. (Telegram on the 29th)

Fancheng – More than 2,000 Japanese troops in northern Zhongxiang attacked in two routes on the 27th. The Chinese army carried out a flanking attack on the Japanese army in the Biansai-Wangjiahe area, and the Japanese army retreated in defeat. (Telegram on the 28th)

Chongqing – According to well-informed sources here, it is rumored that a million elite troops of the Chinese army, fully equipped, have gathered on the northern and southern fronts to await the commander-in-chief's order for a general counteroffensive. This statement seems to be too early. The Chinese army is ready to launch a large-scale counteroffensive at any time, which is taken for granted.

Editorial

### How Should the Business Community Deal With Change?

In a turbulent world, worries and dangers lie ahead, interests move within, reason loses its constancy, and there is no time to examine good and evil, right and wrong. But the good will never lose its goodness, and the right will never lose its rightness. In the past, there were those who doubted the future of the legal tender, but now the legal tender is still the most common and most trusted currency, which is universally recognized; further thinking about the future, no matter how difficult the situation of the legal tender is, it will always be indestructible. Even if there are those who slander it and destroy it, it will not harm its essence. Therefore, those with capital have no reason to be afraid and no reason to hesitate. If they lightly engage in speculation due to suspicion, they will only see themselves destroyed. Originally, speculators are gamblers, with profits and losses, and successes and failures are uncertain. If you think you can rely on this, then the fundamental nature of speculation is an iceberg: If you know that it is unreliable, then why use your wealth as a desperate gamble! Leaving aside speculation, the temporary gains and losses are not enough to be gains and losses. Only a long-term vision has its value. The gains and losses of one corner are not enough to be gains and losses. Only the final success is the real victory. Therefore, those who are now hovering in the buying and selling market, constantly worrying about the stakes, should take a step back and think about it. Do not think that the market will inevitably rise and fall endlessly, and always give speculators the opportunity to maneuver; you must know that the world is changing constantly, and you will see sudden and turbulent waves; this reaction, even a rapid decline, is unpredictable.

To put it bluntly, a country standing in the world cannot close itself off economically and be independent of the country: Today and in the future, China's economy is dependent on the War of Resistance; the day of victory in the War of Resistance is the time of economic prosperity. The causes and consequences of war for the national economy are deeply related and have complex effects, which cannot be detailed here; but considering the interconnectedness of international relations, the close relationship between prosperity and decline, which friendly countries that are closely related to China's national economy are willing to see China's three-year efforts in the War of Resistance wasted in one day? From the past to the future, those who provide assistance to China are actually benefiting themselves and China, and all are based on the principle of mutual benefit and driven by the calculation of mutual benefit. This is not only the case for China, but the United States' aid to Britain is for the sake of justice and also for its own sake. Otherwise, the barriers of the Atlantic Ocean would be completely dismantled. The United States has decided to aid China, and aid to China has not started today, but only because there are obstacles, the aid is not seen to be active. But what will happen in the future? Jones' words are worth pondering. Whether it is fifty million or one hundred million, as long as China has a way, the United States will not be stingy. Therefore, during the period of China's continued War of Resistance, no matter how long the period is, even if China's economic situation reaches an extreme degree of difficulty, it is expected, but it will never fall into a desperate situation with no way out, this can be said with certainty. Victory originally requires hard work to achieve; what is being fought for. This is hard work that does not end, and the other is that international blockade is increasingly tightened and collapses first. This is the difference between having help and not having help. It is also the judgment of victory and defeat. The sky is about to dawn, and the darkness is very thick; the rainstorm is about to pass, and the drops are getting bigger;

Shanghai's future situation may be similar to drinking. However, why should the business community be spared from losses? Do not fall into the trap yourself. If the war expands, the expenses will be more complicated, the extortion will be more severe, and they will intensify the squeeze in various ways and on various pretexts; in addition, there are many who take advantage of the fire and loot and take the opportunity to profit; therefore, legitimate industry and commerce will inevitably suffer greatly, even to the point of being unable to stand, and eventually be swallowed up. Moreover, there is no need to wait for the future, even in terms of the present, those who do business in the concession, although they have not been restricted on the surface, are generally the same as the industrial and commercial circles in the occupied areas in terms of the entry and exit of goods, such as the wheat of flour mills, the cotton of yarn mills, the rice of rice shops (except for foreign rice at present), and even vegetables, fish and meat, which seem to have an endless source. In reality, they are all leftovers after being squeezed dry. As for the so-called exorbitant taxes and levies, these are all inherent Chinese terms, but when examining the degree of cruelty, it is unprecedented in Chinese history. It is now very severe, and who knows whether it will become worse in the future due to exhaustion, causing the concession to suffer even more cruelty! In the coming disaster, the people of the city should understand in advance. Do not regard it as an unexpected blow, and be prepared to endure all kinds of devastation and all kinds of suffering; treat it calmly until the arrival of light. Those who act perversely will inevitably fall soon, this is the law of nature, and the ultimate truth.

In terms of finance, what is first coveted is currency, but based on the experience of the "Federal Reserve Notes," Japan may not want to seek trouble for itself and take the same action, but it must also think about establishing a relationship with it. The currency system problem is extremely difficult, and it cannot be commanded by empty talk, nor can it be controlled by high pressure. Therefore, planning on paper will inevitably be difficult to achieve. It is not an overnight thing to destroy the deeply rooted legal tender. If you want to borrow time, then time is the most un monopolizable thing and is shared by everyone. This is an economic war, not a positional war. We use strategy to maneuver and strength to determine the outcome. Chinese and foreign people must deeply believe in the depth of the legal tender. Is there any need to wait for the outcome to be determined in the future? In terms of foreign exchange, foreign exchange is actually controlled by the United Kingdom and the United States, which is undeniable. The reason why Shanghai has today's foreign exchange market is that British and American merchants at that time were too attached to short-term gains and harbored thoughts of appeasement, and did not make a thorough solution. In the future, British and American merchants should also have the courage to burn their boats and fight to the end not only in the war but also in finance. Then, the future of foreign exchange will inevitably be more favorable to a free China.

In short, the business community must try to suppress temporary impulses, reject bizarre rumors, maintain calmness, and not seek trouble for themselves. Do not look at the fact that after Tianjin banned the use of the legal tender, the value of the legal tender rose instead, because the currency used has no reserves, so it has little value in international exchange. When going in and out, the legal tender is still required. It can be seen that the depth of the legal tender is by no means empty talk, and the British pound and American gold dollar will definitely give the legal tender the necessary support in policy.

### Supplementary Measures for Encouraging Industrial Technology

Chongqing - The Provisional Regulations for Encouraging Industrial Technology and their Implementation Rules, promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, stipulate certain procedures for applying for patents, granting rights, and revoking rights for those who invent or create industrial technologies. However, they lack a proactive spirit of assistance. At this important stage of resistance and reconstruction, industrial inventions and creations are of great importance. The Ministry has therefore formulated seven supplementary measures, especially for industrial inventions or research that have a real hope of success but lack the resources to complete them, or those who have already obtained patent rights but whose articles or methods are related to national defense and people's livelihoods but lack the resources to set up factories to manufacture them, or whose articles or methods have made special contributions to national defense and people's livelihoods, all of which will be strongly protected and assisted to promote them. These supplementary measures were promulgated and implemented on November 20th. The original text is as follows: Supplementary Measures for Encouraging Industrial Technology: Article 1. In addition to the provisions of the Provisional Regulations for Encouraging Industrial Technology and their Implementation Rules, the encouragement of industrial technology shall be handled in accordance with these measures.

(Haitong dispatch, 29th)

Struga, on the north shore of Lake Ohrid, Southern Yugoslavia - Reports received here indicate that Greek forces have achieved a victory, storming into Argyrokastron. The city has become a blood-soaked ruin. In yesterday's major battle, Greek forces suffered 7 officers and 150 soldiers killed, and 300 wounded. Italian forces suffered 11 officers and 300 soldiers killed, and approximately 500 wounded. The city fell at 4:00 PM. The Greeks first launched a heavy artillery barrage on the city and then bombed it heavily with aircraft. Then, the two armies engaged in a fierce bayonet and hand-to-hand combat, each using bayonets, trench knives, and hand grenades. Five British Blenheim bombers and three Greek aircraft engaged ten Italian bombers in the sky. Three Italian aircraft were shot down, and one British aircraft was forced to land. The Greek artillery bombardment began at noon. A large part of the city was destroyed, and the dead buried in the rubble are estimated to be around three or four hundred. After the bombardment, Greek infantry charged into the city. Two thousand Italian soldiers resisted fiercely. Around 3:00 PM, Italian forces were unable to hold out and gradually retreated. At 4:00 PM, Greek forces entered the city. In the northeastern theater, it is reported that a large Italian unit was cut off by Greek cavalry and infantry and is being surrounded. The Italian forces have no hope of breaking through except to flee into Yugoslavian territory or surrender. (United Press dispatch, 29th)

London - The "Exchange Telegraph" received a message from Athens yesterday stating that Greek forces launched an offensive on Wednesday night, destroying the resistance of Italian forces in the central sector. The agency also said that the forces that were broken by the Greeks were the Fascist "Alamode" troops. (United Press dispatch, 29th)

Athens - The most significant battles have occurred on the southern front. In the northern sector, Greek forces are now holding positions north of Pogradec, resisting constant Italian attacks.

### Italian Commander-in-Chief Directing at the Front; Rome Telegraph Denies This

### Order Restored in Korçë; Albanian and Greek Flags Fly Everywhere

Korçë - Residents here are recounting incidents of several Italian officers abandoning their soldiers and fleeing. Order has now been restored, and a large portion of the residents are Greek. Albanian and Greek flags are flown at all military posts and public institutions to indicate that the Greek forces came here to liberate Albanians, not to conquer them. The Greek military has strict discipline. Although food is scarce and they have endured weeks of long marches, they never forcibly requisition food from civilians. Therefore, the residents are very pleased with the Greek occupation, as the Greek military's actions are very different from Italian colonial methods. Signs of the Italian efforts to assimilate Korçë are gradually disappearing, and the region is taking on a more rational appearance. The Italian army fled the city in haste, without damaging it, so the city was undamaged. However, the countryside outside the city was not so fortunate. According to Albanians in charge, the villagers were greatly abused. The Italian military's discipline relied solely on Fascist Party leaders, gendarmes, and a small number of Blackshirts. Morale was extremely low. When the two sides fought on the Morava Mountains, the Italian army collapsed and scattered like a flock of birds. Only the Blackshirts defended the plateau against the Greek army. These people were eventually annihilated. Although Italian Commander-in-Chief General Badoglio ordered that Korçë be held, the Italian soldiers who retreated from the front only made the city more chaotic. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

### Unprecedented Defeat of the Italian Army in Southern Albania: Corpses of Italian Soldiers Scattered Throughout the Valleys

Korçë – The plain of Korçë will henceforth occupy a prominent page in Italian history. The retreat of the Italian army can only be compared to the Battle of Caporetto in the last World War. The Italian army's retreat from Guadalajara during the Spanish Civil War was far smaller in scale. Italian soldiers' corpses littered the heights of Morava. A column of cavalry moving through a valley was suddenly attacked by Greek cavalry charging down from the mountains, suffering heavy losses. Greek mountain artillery, positioned on the high ground, bombarded the Italian strongholds defending Korçë and destroyed the Italian barracks in the city. Greek troops charged the Italian machine-gun positions with bayonets, and the Italian army, unable to withstand the assault, abandoned Korçë and retreated. (Reuter, 29th)

### Details of the Anglo-Italian Naval Battle off Sardinia: Royal Naval Air Arm Assists in Combat, Four or Five Italian Warships Heavily Damaged

London – The Admiralty released a detailed account of the engagement between British and Italian warships in the Mediterranean on Wednesday. On Wednesday afternoon, British warships encountered two Italian battleships and several cruisers and destroyers 77 miles northeast of Italian-held Sardinia. The leading British warships sighted four enemy cruisers a few minutes after noon and immediately opened fire. The enemy cruisers returned fire and quickly turned away, creating a smokescreen and speeding northeastward. At 12:10 PM, two enemy battleships and one cruiser were sighted. The enemy battleships opened fire on the British cruisers, which were forced to retreat due to their superior firepower. However, the enemy battleships also retreated after a few minutes, and the British cruisers immediately continued the pursuit but were unable to catch up. The British battleship "Renown" made every effort to engage, but the enemy ships retreated quickly and were not brought to battle. At 1:10 PM, the pursuit reached a point a few miles from the enemy coast, and the British ships ceased their advance. By this time, the enemy ships had scattered and were at a great distance from the British ships, using smokescreens, so the extent of the damage they sustained could not be ascertained. However, according to reconnaissance reports from British aircraft, the enemy ships had suffered significant damage from British gunfire before reaching the coast to take refuge or escaping behind the smokescreen. One enemy cruiser, believed to be armed with 8-inch guns, had a severe fire burning on its stern. One enemy destroyer had its stern submerged and was listing heavily, while another enemy destroyer was slightly listing and proceeding very slowly. During the British pursuit, naval aircraft from the British aircraft carrier "Ark Royal" repeatedly launched fierce attacks. One Swordfish aircraft attacked an enemy battleship with a torpedo, hitting a powerful new Littorio-class battleship. Other Swordfish aircraft attacked three enemy 8-inch gun cruisers, and a torpedo likely hit the stern of a 10,000-ton Pola-class enemy ship. After this attack, the speed of the enemy flagship immediately decreased. A squadron of British Skua aircraft then attacked an enemy 6-inch gun cruiser, and its boilers appeared to have been damaged. All British aircraft returned safely. The British cruiser "Berwick" was also hit by two shells, but the damage was minor, and the ship remains combat-ready. The British suffered one officer and six sailors killed, two sailors severely wounded, and seven slightly wounded. The British ships were also attacked by ten bombers escorted by fighters, but naval aircraft intercepted them, so the British ships were not damaged. At 4:40 PM, fifteen enemy bombers, divided into three groups, attacked again. British fighters again intercepted them, and some enemy aircraft managed to penetrate and drop thirty bombs. The guns of the "Ark Royal" fired fiercely at the enemy aircraft, and the ship was not damaged, and there were no casualties among the crew. One enemy Cant Z.506B three-engine seaplane and one R.403 seaplane were shot down. The British also lost one fighter. Apart from this aircraft and the damage to the "Berwick" and the slight casualties, the British suffered no other losses or damage. Italian radio in Rome yesterday acknowledged that the Italian destroyer "Lanciere" was hit and severely damaged during the engagement and had to be towed into port by another ship. The Italian cruiser "Fiume" was also hit by a shell, but it did not explode. (Reuter, 29th)

Rome – An Italian military communiqué stated that Italian aircraft spotted a British naval fleet near Malta and bombed it, scoring a direct hit on a large British warship.

In Tripoli, a ship and the pier where it was docked were heavily damaged by bombs, and the fire was very intense, visible from a distance an hour later. All British aircraft returned safely.

### The Underground Life of Londoners

Glenner: "I was sitting on a mat in the basement, leaning against a pillow, listening to the nine o'clock news report on the wireless radio placed on my lap, when suddenly there was a deafening explosion. I thought I was surely going to die. I could hear the sounds of collapsing houses all around, especially above my house. In an instant, the basement ceiling shook, and the soil and plaster above it peeled off and fell to the ground. I thought the whole house was going to collapse and would surely collapse on top of me before I could escape. I was especially concerned about Mickey and the housekeeper. I wasn't sure if they were dead or injured. I remember hearing the housekeeper had been seriously injured. Within seconds, the housekeeper said to her husband on the phone, 'The house is in trouble because of the severe shock. I can't move. I have to leave and go elsewhere.' Then I remembered to put on my steel helmet. But because I was flustered, I couldn't find it for a moment. Suddenly, I realized it was still in my hand. Before going upstairs to fix the blackout curtains hanging in front of the window, I decided to check the two basement exits first. If the house wasn't stable, it might fall into the kitchen. My backside was already teetering, or it had already hit the teapot and was about to fall on Glenner's beloved little dog. The housekeeper was already preparing to escape from the basement. The bottom floor wind blew straight into the dining room because the large front door in the living room was tightly closed. I couldn't open the lock with a key. I ran towards the back door, which was also thrown to the other end of the house. But when I opened the door, dust rushed into my face, and the smoke and sulfur from the bomb explosion almost suffocated me. I dragged the housekeeper back to the kitchen and laid her flat on the floor to calm her down. I thought everything was over for us. I slammed the door shut and ran upstairs, thinking the worst had happened. The ceiling boards, bricks, and glass were blasted into the air, then fell down from the windows and roof. Streams of smoke and gunpowder filled the house. In desperation, the sound of explosions suddenly stopped. I heard Glenner's shouts from the darkness.

Mickey: "I changed into old pants, a wool vest, and a leather jacket. I was standing in the fourth-floor bathroom when suddenly, a warning whistle sounded. A terrible explosion occurred in the square in front of the house. The whole house was shaking there, and I stood motionless, like a wooden chicken. Although my mind kept telling me to go downstairs quickly, I still insisted on doing mechanical actions, flushing the toilet, buttoning my pants, and turning off the bathroom light, before finally running down three floors. I grabbed a flashlight on the table in the living room to see what was happening. We couldn't help but shout together: "An airplane!" That's right. It was the iron skeleton of a German Junkers bomber, about the size of a coffin. The wreckage looked like a car had been hit by a train. Suddenly, I heard a woman crying in the garden in the middle of the square. Mickey ran across the street to help her. The housekeeper and I went back into the door to avoid falling shrapnel."

Mickey: "I stumbled into the garden and saw a frightened woman in the middle of the garden, unable to reach the entrance of the public air raid shelter. She told me that she had just walked past the corner of the building three doors away, where the German plane had exploded, and had escaped unscathed. One bomb exploded as the German plane flew over the square. Another one landed, and the German plane itself exploded and fell on the roof of the house. I was so dazed that instead of taking her to the public air raid shelter, I took her across the street towards her house, which was already engulfed in flames along with several neighboring houses. I realized I had made a mistake and led her to the public air raid shelter. As I walked through the garden gate, I encountered two women wearing nightgowns and huddled in blankets. I led all three of them into the air raid shelter. After that, I ran back to my house. I saw wreckage of the German plane on the steps and decided to collect it as a souvenir of the night's disaster. Therefore, Glenner and I carefully carried a small gift from Göring into the living room."

Glenner: "A few minutes later, we gathered in the basement again. Soon after, we all agreed that because there were so many bombs dropped by the German plane near the burning target, there might still be unexploded time bombs hidden in the plane's wreckage. Perhaps our house would be bombed immediately. Under these circumstances, we couldn't wait to find a way to leave the house. We didn't stop to pack anything. Mickey and I had already steeled our hearts not to take the dog with us. But the housekeeper begged us to take the little dog with us, so we went upstairs again and led the dog down. Not far away, we saw the street covered with broken glass and fallen trees, so we had to carry the little dog in our arms."

Mickey: "We trudged along the street towards the train station, hoping to find a streetcar there. Under the bright flames, we could see groups of residents running out of the basements of their homes and heading towards the undamaged public air raid shelters in the square. Some people stood helplessly in the doorways, not knowing whether to risk crossing the street or stay in their threatened houses. Halfway to the station, a red light suddenly appeared at the corner of the street near where we were standing, illuminating everything as if it were daytime. From experience, I knew what was about to happen. Just as the bomb exploded, we crouched down in the doorway of a reinforced concrete building. Two storefronts away, the bomb hit the building directly. Fortunately, it was at the corner, and the blast didn't hit us. We quickly took steps forward and saw a lonely car in front of the station. The driver was willing to risk driving us to the Duchess Hotel. We couldn't help but shake his hand.

Glenner: "The hotel lounge was filled with social dignitaries and foreign diplomats. The big shots and semi-tycoons of London looked at us as if we were refugees from a concentration camp. As we were drinking in the bar, my hand inadvertently reached into my pocket. In a hypnotized gesture, I pulled out a teacup. I couldn't even remember taking it from home, but I must have unconsciously stuffed it into my pocket before leaving the air raid shelter, without a doubt. Life magazine photographer Vandyver and his wife were also staying at the hotel. They had moved out because their original place was near a time bomb. The couple joined us in celebrating our escape.

### Nazi Planes Swarm Again, Bombing Liverpool Wildly, Hundreds of Tons of Bombs Dropped, The Whole City in Flames, Aiming to Destroy British Shipping Center

London: Last night and this morning, Nazi planes continued their blitzkrieg against British seaports and food centers, launching a large-scale air raid on Liverpool, a town in Merseyside, and southwestern England. German planes also attacked Bristol and Southampton fiercely last night, with bomber fleets coming and going continuously, swarming like bees, dropping bombs everywhere, causing the bombed area to spread widely. (United Press, 29th)

Berlin: Several hundred German planes bombed Liverpool last night, dropping hundreds of thousands of kilograms of bombs. (Haitong Telegraph, 29th)

Berlin: It is learned here that large formations of German aircraft made a terrible attack on Liverpool in England this morning. German pilots reported upon returning, "The whole city of Liverpool is in flames." It is said that gasoline pools, dock warehouses, granaries, power plants, etc., are all on fire. (United Press, 29th)

London: Today, London admitted that Liverpool and its suburbs had been heavily bombed by German planes from late last night until early this morning. It is said that this attack was the most intense since Liverpool was bombed. Concentrated German aircraft dropped hundreds of tons of high-explosive and incendiary bombs on the city. Allied planes from the Axis also participated in this attack. Several cities in the Midlands and on the west coast were also bombed. The number of dead and wounded is feared to be very high. This bombing is intended to retaliate against British air raids on Cologne. It is learned that the railway junction between Liverpool, Plymouth, and London was crippled by German planes early this morning. (International Telegraph, 29th)

Liverpool: From last night until this morning, continuous waves of large German planes wildly bombed Liverpool and the districts of Merseyside, as well as several northwestern towns, for more than eight hours. Although anti-aircraft guns resisted from time to time, most homes in several commercial properties and working-class areas were damaged. According to eyewitnesses, during the air raid, shrapnel fell in the streets like rain. It is reported that the losses do not seem very great, but the dead and wounded are feared to be very tragic. (United Press, 27th)

Berlin: The German High Command announced this afternoon that from last night until dawn today, German planes dropped several tons of high-explosive bombs on Liverpool at the mouth of the Mersey River. The city has turned into a fiery hell. It is said that the concentrated German attack on this important industrial city in central England aims to destroy the British shipping center. The German plane's fierce bombing of various centers in England, including the recent air raids on Portsmouth and Coventry, has crippled British shipyards. In the future, British ships that are damaged, and those that are severely damaged, must be sent to Canada for repairs. (International News Agency, 29th)

London: The Air Ministry issued a report last night stating that there were no deaths or serious injuries in the UK during the day yesterday. Yesterday, German fighters and fighter-bombers flew several times over Kent and the mouth of the Thames, flying very high and dropping very few bombs. A town in Kent was hit by bombs, damaging houses. Five enemy fighters were shot down, and six British fighters were lost. (Reuters, 29th)

London: The railway nerve center between Germany and the occupied areas of Western Europe, i.e., western Germany, has been heavily bombed by British planes for two consecutive nights. British bombers concentrated their attacks on the Hohenzollern Bridge (with two railways and one highway on it), the railway lines on both sides, the warehouses, and the train station for several hours, disrupting traffic at this extremely important location. In addition to the disruption of traffic, warehouses elsewhere in the city were also attacked. The east and west sides of the bridge were bombed and set on fire, stretching for miles.

German planes bombed the UK, dropping bombs like raindrops

### German Submarines Rampant, Intensifying the Naval Blockade of England, Food Shortages Feared on the British Isles, Authorities Advise People to Practice Frugality

London: The German submarine and surface raider blockade of Britain's overseas supply has now reached an extremely tense level, leading British officials to announce yesterday that the government intends to expand food restrictions. Certain types of fruit will be completely banned, and meat imports will also be reduced. Food Minister Lord Woolton announced that during the winter milk shortage period, home milk supplies will be reduced across the board, except for maternity patients, children and those in hospital, because too many ships are being sunk, resulting in an extreme shortage of refrigerated transport, making it necessary to take drastic measures. This statement is consistent with the statement made on Wednesday by Minister without Portfolio, Greenwood, that British ship losses have surged. Mr. Wood said, "Many luxury items must disappear from the nation's tables. Apples, apricots, grapes, and other items unnecessary for a wartime population must be temporarily given up." Another step in the British reorganization of merchant ships can be seen in a recent announcement, namely that Greece has authorized its London committee to requisition Greek ships outside the eastern Mediterranean and Greek merchant ships over 4,000 tons in the eastern Mediterranean. Shipping circles now believe that Germany has at least two surface raiders, or perhaps more than two, outside the British Isles, two in the Atlantic, and one in the Indian Ocean. German submarines now have bases from Norway in the north to the Bay of Biscay in the south, and German naval attacks will become even more rampant in winter, because the days are short and the nights are long, making them easier to move around. (United Press, 29th)

### Naval Battle in the English Channel

London: A naval communique announced that several British light warships engaged the enemy in the English Channel this morning. The enemy ships retreated towards Brest at full speed, and the British ships pursued them from behind. It is now known that one British ship was damaged, and the extent of damage to the enemy ships is unknown. (Reuters, 29th)

Berlin: According to the German official news agency, British and German destroyers engaged in a battle at the western end of the English Channel. Two British ships were hit by torpedoes fired by German ships. Another German destroyer squadron sank two British ships (one of 9,000 tons and another of 3,000 tons). The date of the naval battle was not mentioned in the above news. (Reuters, 29th)

Educational News

### An Overview of Five Major Cultural Enterprises of the Catholic Church in China (3)

The Beitang Library is one of the newest cultural enterprises of the Catholic Church in China. It was only established a few years ago, so it is not yet well-known. However, the history of its predecessor is quite long. Beitang is the largest main church in Beiping. However, today's Beitang Library is organized from the old library collections of Dongtang, Nantang, and Xitang. Among the four church libraries, Nantang is the oldest, established in the 18th year of the Wanli era of the Ming Dynasty (1600). The second oldest is Dongtang, established in the 7th year of the Shunzhi era of the Qing Dynasty (1650). Beitang was founded in the 25th year of the Kangxi era (23 years after 1700). Xitang also laid its foundation.

The history of the Beitang collection can be divided into four periods: (1) the period of separate collections in the four churches, from the initial establishment of each church to the 59th year of the Qianlong era (1785); (2) the early period of management by Jesuit priests, from the 50th year of the Qianlong era to the 7th year of the Daoguang era (1817); (3) the period of management by the Russian Orthodox Church, from the 7th year of the Daoguang era to the 10th year of the Xianfeng era (1860); (4) the later period of management by Jesuit priests, also known as the period of Beitang's sole collection, from the 10th year of the Xianfeng era to the present. From now on, it will enter the era of formal opening with modern scientific management, which is a new era in the history of the four church library collections. However, over the past 300 years, the four church library collections have also endured hardships. For example, Gengtang was originally the residence of many famous writers among the missionaries of the time, so there must have been many books left behind. Before 1651, Tang Ruowang (Johann Adam Schall von Bell) alone had over 3,000 volumes of books. However, when the missionaries encountered difficulties in the 17th year of the Jiaqing era (1812), the books were scattered in several places and eventually lost. The books of Xitang were stored in Nantang, so they were spared. In the 7th year of the Daoguang era, Bishop Pires entrusted all the books to Archbishop Vlcratchevitchll of the Orthodox Church. Thirteen years later, they were recovered. After repeated transfers, there were still some losses. During the religious persecution, the books of the churches were moved to the Zhengfu Temple in Pingxi and the Xiwanzhi Temple in Chahar, and were even buried underground, causing some to rot. There were also losses in the fire at Nantang in the 40th year of the Qianlong era (1775) and the fire at Dongtang in the 16th year of the Jiaqing era (1807). In the 12th year of the Guangxu era, the old Beitang (on the site of today's Zhongnanhai) was ceded to the Qing government. The new church was built in Waiku, and the books were also moved there, which is now the Beitang Library.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Library Sets Fee Regulations for Borrowing Books

The opening hours of the library's reading room are now from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm, including Sundays. The library director will be stationed at the library during opening hours so that book subscribers can consult him at any time. In addition, the fee regulations for subscribing to books at the library have now been set as follows: 15 yuan per year, 9 yuan per half year, 6 yuan per quarter, and 3 yuan per month. Students pay 6 yuan per year and 3 yuan per half year. The above fee regulations will take effect on December 1. The library is currently located at No. 2 Beijing Road, Yitai Building.

### The Poor Children's Out-of-School Relief Center Discusses Rectification Measures

The Shanghai Poor Children's Out-of-School Relief Center has been presided over by Director Zhang Guoquan. Recently, due to social criticism, Zhang Shouyong, chairman of the center's board of directors, Wu Yunzhai, chairman of the board of supervisors, and Dai Chunfeng and Sun Choucheng, the chairman and vice-chairman of the executive committee, all believe that providing relief to out-of-school children is one of society's charitable endeavors for children and should be improved and rectified. It is imperative that the truth be clarified. In addition to sending personnel to investigate the financial and educational situation of the center, a meeting was held on November 27 to discuss all of the center's previous accounts, which were audited by accountant Wu Songling. To be cautious, two other accountants were invited to conduct a thorough investigation. The center's future plans have also been discussed and decided, with the addition of two departments: a teaching affairs department and a financial affairs department. One director of the teaching affairs department and one director of the financial affairs department will be hired to be responsible for handling teaching affairs and financial matters. During the investigation period, Director Zhang will continue to be responsible.

Jia Yidong also plays for the team. The team recently won the Guangshi Cup women's championship. When they face the Shanghai Stars, they will be evenly matched. The headlining men's game will be between the Western team Mains and the emerging Chinese team Shanghai Stars. In order to cooperate, Mains will be made up of officers. They have a new player from the United States this year, making them incredibly strong. The Shanghai Stars have Chen Xuechong, Chen Bangzhen, Zhuo Guorong, and Liang Yunming. Zheng Qinming is also up and coming and a strong fighter. It is expected that the Chinese and Western teams will put on an exciting performance.

### East China Today vs. Western Police

Starting at 2:30 PM at Recreation Ground, the final match of the first round of Group A. This year's participants in the Zilin Cup football tournament include 13 teams such as the Chinese United, Youyou, Yousheng, and the French Army. The opening ceremony will be held this afternoon, with two matches: French Army vs. Rowing and French Navy vs. Maccabi, both at the Racecourse. In terms of league matches, the perennial champion East China will face the Western Police in Group A at Recreation Ground, starting at 2:30 PM, with referee Shen Huichun. East China has already won six out of six matches in this group. Today is the final match of the first round. Although center Cai Shengfei cannot attend, Huang Kehou will be present, and with Han Longhai's full-court running, their strength has not been weakened. On the forward line, since Fei Chunhua took over the right wing, his performance has been excellent, making the attack much sharper. The Western Police have been bolstered by new players such as Fonseca this year, and they won several matches at the beginning, but ultimately their strength proved mediocre, and they lost two consecutive matches. Therefore, considering the continuation of the battle, East China has a good chance of defeating the Western Police and achieving seven wins in seven matches. The East China reserve team will also play against the North West Children's team at Jiaozhou Park. Today's tickets are 6 jiao and 1 yuan 1 jiao at Recreation Ground, and 3 jiao at Jiaozhou Park.

### Food:
### Rice, round-grained rice hindered from entering concession
### Rumors fuel rice hoarding households
### Foreign rice prices rise by one or two yuan, medicinal materials rise by four or five yuan
### All due to poor environment caused by the current situation.

Large quantities of foreign rice will arrive in Shanghai today and tomorrow.

The foreign rice market yesterday experienced a great storm. In the early market, the "Nanjing recognition" issue caused wealthy people inside and outside the industry to absorb as much as possible, saying that the legal tender would have problems, and wanted to buy all the rice, which not only threatens the livelihood of the common people, but also seems to declare war on the common people. Later, it was rumored that domestic rice was blocked, and round-grained and glutinous rice prices rose, and foreign rice hoarders became more greedy. The price was kicked higher like a football. The current price of foreign rice in each store has been raised by more than one or two yuan. Foreign glutinous rice is affected by domestic glutinous rice and is particularly popular. The number one Saigon original package from Yinghua Company opened at 90 yuan the day before yesterday. Although there was a shout of 91 yuan, no transaction was made. Yesterday, it rose from 92.5 yuan to 93 yuan, and the December price was 92 yuan. The number two spot price was 89 yuan, and the December price was 96.5 yuan, which was two or three yuan higher than the day before yesterday. However, in the afternoon market, it was revealed that rice merchants had directly ordered thousands of tons from Myanmar and Yunnan. Also announced on the market was that Rixing Foreign Company had a deal of 1,000 tons of Xiaowen in January, at a price of 81 yuan. The market could no longer support it at this point. The December number one Saigon, which opened at 92 yuan in the morning, immediately dropped to 90 yuan in the afternoon. Other rice prices also dropped by one or two yuan. The spot price of each store also fell by one yuan or more. As a result, the current foreign rice was only about half a yuan higher than the night before, but those who wanted to sell foreign rice insisted and most refused to sell cheaply. Moreover, there were not many circulating chips on the market, so the transaction was less than 500 tons, while the spot goods were absorbed by large non-industry households, with transactions of no less than 20,000 bags, calculated as 78 yuan for number one Saigon, 74 yuan and 8 jiao for number two, followed by 73 yuan, 77 yuan to 74 yuan for Huojiao, 72.5 yuan for number two Siam, to 71.5 yuan, 71.8 jiao for Xiaojiao, to 71.5 yuan, 66 yuan to 64 yuan for Milu, and 62.5 yuan to 60 yuan for Suijian, 69 yuan to 68.5 yuan for Wuhu Jian.

The source of new Jingjian and Chazhi, etc., was cut off due to being blocked outside the boundary, resulting in an abnormal shortage among general cargo owners, and shopkeepers and customers, for fear of missing out, also competed to handle it regardless of the high price, which led to a sharp rise in medicinal materials of four or five yuan. Kaiyuan package was 90 yuan and 5 jiao, to 90 yuan, and Hujian was 88 yuan to 86.5 yuan. New Jing also rose by one or two yuan. The ordinary original package opened at 95 yuan, but Duyangjian was completely out of stock and there was no market.

In this favorable situation, glutinous rice followed suit, and the small, independent rice-carrying wine households were doing quite well. Moreover, large households continued to hoard, so the price also rose by one or two yuan. Guan Li Special Yuan had already sold for 90 yuan, and Zhongguan also needed 88 yuan. Hong Kong White Yuan was 79 yuan, followed by 76 yuan, and Nuo Tea was 66 yuan to 64.5 yuan.

A large batch of foreign rice will arrive in Shanghai today. The French ship "Paos" is directly transporting 1,600 tons of foreign rice from the West. Also, the "Albert SarTant" ship, managed by Hualun Foreign Company, is carrying 3,000 tons of foreign rice. According to the original schedule, it should have arrived yesterday, but there was no news until late at night. According to the company, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. Qiahe Foreign Company, Yongsheng Wheel, and Taikoo Company's Jialun Wheel are carrying foreign rice from Hong Kong to Shanghai, and are expected to enter the port today. (Zu)

### Australian Flour Road Goods Sold Off

Flour Street Sales Limited to 8,000 Bags

Flour: Yesterday's spot flour transactions were quite active, but they were mainly foreign flour. Because Chinese flour factories only supply 8,000 bags to this street every day, it is not easy to buy them unless they are designated flour dealers. Therefore, foreign flour is the most noticed by this street. It is heard that the second batch of 30,000 bags of fixed flour has just arrived and is being unloaded. Most of the goods have been pre-sold, and the Australian flour that will arrive in early December has been selling off road goods for days. This street and customers are absorbing them one after another. Zhonglou, Huawu brand, etc., have all risen to 18 yuan and 8 jiao, with transactions of about 3,000 bags. The price of American foreign flour, Fushou brand, is 20 yuan, and the price of high-quality fresh goods is 19 yuan and 8 jiao to 19 yuan, 2 or 3 jiao. The market is becoming increasingly tight.

Wheat: Yesterday, there were still about two or three hundred bags from Su Kun and other places, all of which were sent to Japanese factories. Although Chinese factories are greedy, they still regret that there is no goods to receive. It is heard that the market price of Gaodu wheat is 29 yuan, but there are not many, and there are no suitable recipients. The ordering of foreign wheat is still under discussion.

### Oil Cake: Soybean Oil Futures Have Been Abandoned

Yesterday's oil market lacked both buyers and sellers, resulting in a lack of activity in the market. However, Dalian soybean oil has been sold on the market by the adjustment members organized in the past. Because it is a test nature, the number is still small, and the overall situation has not been affected. Statistics show that 20 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded at a price of 103 yuan. 100 barrels were ordered for delivery in January at a price of 99 yuan, and 350 barrels were priced at 100 yuan. 30 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil were priced at 74 yuan and 5 jiao. 100 dan of Dayou Factory soybean oil were priced at 80 yuan. 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were priced at 74 yuan and 7.5 jiao to 74 yuan. 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were priced at 103 yuan. 700 barrels were ordered for delivery in late December at a price of 104 yuan and 7.5 jiao to 104 yuan.

### Finance: Japanese and American Merchants Sell Off, Foreign Exchange Turns From Tight to Stable

Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's listed prices did not rise or fall. The dark market for British and American exchange rates was quite tight for forward contracts for a while. This is because most speculators still tend to buy, and the wind of buying is reduced after Hong Kong electricity is concluded. However, the American and Japanese banks are not lazy to supply, especially the Japanese bank Mitsui sold cheaply in the early morning, and the market turned from soft to hard. In the evening, the British and American exchange rates were stable.

### Speculators Tend to Buy

In the early morning, the London big bar was flat for both near and far terms. London raw gold was fixed, and the exchange rate was flat against the United States and Shanghai. The United States was unchanged against the United Kingdom, down 5 points against Shanghai, and there was no market against France. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks opened with a spot selling price of 3 pence 71875 for British gold and 5.8125 for American exchange, the same as the closing price the night before. After opening, it was loose for a while. The Japanese bank came out and the foreign banks absorbed the American exchange for this month at 5 yuan 84375. After a while, speculators vigorously bought, and the market turned strong. The foreign banks' selling price for the next month was from 5 yuan 8125 to 75. The exchange rate did not change. The silver balance tax also did not rise or fall.

### Economic Industry Talks (1) by Feng Liutang

Opium

When it comes to opium, everyone knows that this is the biggest harm to weak China. However, the Chinese are really not afraid of death. They have been working hard on "fire inspection," and they are still lingering.

I don't want to talk about how opium affects people here, just talk about some opium stories briefly. There are still many old people who smoke opium now. I have never had opium in my life, so what I talk about is still a layman. If there are any places that are not comprehensive, please give me your advice.

Opium is a transliteration, translated from Opoum. When it first entered China, it is impossible to verify. However, I saw a record in the writings of a predecessor when I was a child, saying that it had already flowed in during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty. Some say that Emperor Shenzong (Wanli) of the Ming Dynasty collapsed because Li Kezhuo, the Honglu Temple Qing, advanced the red pill. The red pill contained the reason for opium. "It is difficult for an immortal to know the matter of pills," let alone the pills in the palace, it is even more impossible to talk about, let's not talk about it for the time being.

Opium was already popular in China around the end of Qianlong. Because at this time, China was really the golden age of drumming and dancing, literary indulgence and martial play, extravagant desires, and that kind of leisure and refreshing goods were exactly what they liked. He Ci's father was when the British power gradually spread eastward. The East India Company obtained Bengal and other places in India. British merchants had already arrived in Ningbo. Although it was later prohibited, the British sent Macartney to the Qing court to seek trade. In the early years of Jiaqing, I saw the imperial edict prohibiting opium smoking, which shows that opium smoking had become widespread, so it was prohibited!

The Opium War was not a big deal for the British's purpose of trade; but it was a stain on his civilization after all. The author once said that the Opium War was a silver war. A few years ago, I thought about writing this because of the silver problem, but I finally didn't write it, because I don't want to write unless it is necessary these years. These few days, I am talking about the economic industry for the purpose of leaving it as a supplement.

How do you know that it is a silver war? It is not difficult to know from the situation of the barren silver at that time. Because opium requires white hardship, the more people who eat opium, the more silver flows out, but as a result of several defeats, opium has not been prohibited, but it is like mercury pouring on the ground, potassium holes cannot enter, and it has not been cleared for more than a hundred years. Drinking poison to quench thirst is very sad.

Because opium is imported from abroad, most of it is operated by Guangdong gangs, especially people from Chaoshan and other places. Generally, it is called earth. What is the meaning of earth? Some people say that the poppy is refined into a slurry, which is mixed with earth and then sold; others say that the big earth is round, like the earth of the God of Tai Sui that the Chinese people passed down, it is also a rolling circle, so it is named earth. It is probably closer to the earth of mud, because when boiling opium smoke, there are always head and slag according to. (To be continued)

### Gold Market Meets High Prices, Not Lacking Sales

Yesterday's gold market, dark market, was the last day for the second cash futures transaction. The trend revolved around the American market. However, when the market opened in the morning, a securities firm ignored the high or low prices and actually sold 300 taels at the opening price, causing the upward trend to fall sharply to a low price of 5,730 yuan. However, because the foreign exchange rate was soft, gold and silver firms rushed to buy in soon. The firm also came to reinvest because the price it sold was too low, and the price suddenly flew up to 5,780 yuan. As the American exchange rate fell, it was seen on the market again at noon. In the afternoon, it once rose to a high price. Later, it was heard that the buyer had to pay about 5 yuan for the swap this morning, and the wind of coming out of the cage was more prevalent, so the father's plate fell, and finally it was 5,763 yuan, 27 yuan less than the rolling. The total transaction was about 5,000 taels. The cash price was 2 yuan lower than the futures price. The gold firm sold dozens of taels to a certain silver building. Gold for jewelry and customs gold remained flat.

### Red Small Read 7 Yuan

In the early morning, many long-term households were prepared to sell at high prices, because the rise on the previous day was late, and a certain securities gang first sold two or three hundred taels, and the opening fell by five or sixty yuan. It is estimated that the gold firm paid 20 taels for the exchange industry, which was 5,730 yuan. The silver gang took the opportunity to absorb it at a low price and raised it by 50 yuan. It is estimated that the securities gang entered the silver firm 30 taels, 5,780 yuan. However, the gold and silver firms set off a selling wind again, and at this time, the buyer's line wavered, and the price fell. The money exchange industry did 30 taels, only 5,736 yuan. Fortunately, retail investors and other scattered purchases, and sellers slightly reduced, gradually saw the pull up "calculated gold firm into the silver firm 20 taels, reported 5,765 yuan, forced to noon to close, there are also W thousand seven hundred and fifty-one yuan, the later market is very strong, but the foreign exchange rate is slightly soft, the securities gang suddenly sprouted buying intention, the first to pick up, calculated the silver firm sold to 30 taels, 5,760 yuan, continued to 20 taels, 5,780 yuan, but not long after the help of a certain number of stops to enter the stop, the transaction seems to be a hat grab nature, resulting in the silver firm out of money to do 30 taels, 5,755 yuan, after still up, it is Lai money to buy in, the late closing to 5,773 yuan, the result fell by 10 yuan, the money to enter the silver firm 20 taels, 5,763 yuan, 27 yuan lower than the previous day, the whole day 50 yuan up and down, the current price of the cash number of gold sales, compared to red red higher than 10 yuan, received 30 yuan lower, the current gold as the listed gold lower than 560 yuan, are fresh to do open,

### Securities: Rumors of Disability, Internal Debt Trading Turns Flat

London Chinese Debt Still Strong

The securities market, yesterday the market was extremely chaotic, the rumors were complicated, and the advantages and disadvantages were indistinguishable. On the one hand, the rumors of continued loans from the United States were very strong. On the other hand, the rumors in Nanjing were becoming more and more true. At the same time, the old stories of issuing treasury bills were revived. Speculators were lost in this variety of situations and lost their common strength. Therefore, those who observed were empty, and those who were many were many, with no general compliance. The market for public bonds was uncertain. In the recent two or three days, the news should be clarified. Yesterday's transactions, Hongda · Lianhe · sold out in the morning and bought back in the afternoon · Xinfu · Niu Da · sold out throughout · Jiufu Tongxing · Yonghe · Wuyuan, Jiufeng · Tongkang · bought in the morning and had no transactions in the afternoon.

### Yarn Flower: Around the End of the Year, Cotton Yarn Is Still Seen in the Market

The yarn market is stable, and the trend is relatively calm. This is because it was widely rumored that the port of Shayu Chong in Dapeng Bay was once bombed. People's hearts were timid, and most of them sold short and looked small. The place has been as peaceful as usual, and the cargo transportation is as smooth as usual. Therefore, the thoughts of the multi-party have improved, and at the same time, the Hong Kong gang's purchases have progressed, so the market has recovered. However, some people think that around the end of the year, it is still in the market. The fundamental problem is still the first key to actual sales.

Shuangma opened in the morning, because in the afternoon of the previous day, gold rose sharply, and the foreign exchange line shrunk, and those outside the industry had a strong intention to buy, so the opening jumped high, the price was 1,225 yuan, up 10 yuan, this plate opened, but the general small silver shops and small money shops are looking at the bill of exchange to shrink, and drag into a lot, in a moment rose to 1,252 yuan, but the high price once appeared, those who profited spit out, there are quite a few people, plus the Guangdong gang business is not very developed, at the same time, the foreign market after the contraction and then turned long, so the floating more out of the file chips slightly loose, fell to 1,2189 yuan, the closing slightly back up, check Niu Japan asked the transaction statistics 4,980 packs, the market 20 Shuangma rose 9 yuan, now the amount of each gang to buy, listed as left,

### Shanghai-Nanjing Train Hit Landmine: 150 Dead and Injured. Derailment Near Waikatang. Five Train Cars Reportedly Completely Destroyed.

Yesterday morning around 9:30 AM, a passenger train traveling from Shanghai North Station to Nanjing derailed near Waikatang, east of Suzhou and west of Weiting. As a result, many passenger cars were destroyed. It is reported that the incident resulted in approximately 100 or more deaths and injuries. Shanghai-Nanjing rail traffic was thus suddenly interrupted yesterday.

Two Americans Seriously Injured

Late last night, this newspaper obtained reliable information from foreign sources stating that the express train traveling from Shanghai to Nanjing yesterday morning was derailed by a landmine explosion near Suzhou. At the time, the front several passenger cars immediately fell to the side of the road. The detailed circumstances of the accident are still awaiting further reports, but it is known that 150 passengers were killed or injured. Among them were two Americans who were also seriously injured. Whether reporter Mu Neng can confirm that there was also one Japanese person injured, whose identity is unknown.

Explosion Near Suzhou from Landmine

The English-language "The China Press" reported that around 10:00 AM this morning (29th), a special train heading to Nanjing, carrying many passengers, including dozens of Japanese officials, was on its way to Nanjing to participate in the signing of the "treaty" on the 30th when it hit a landmine and exploded near Suzhou, resulting in more than one hundred deaths and injuries. The landmine was placed on the tracks five miles from Suzhou, and detonated upon contact. Five train cars were completely destroyed, with fragments flying hundreds of yards away.

Japanese Side Admits Accident

It is believed that the train in question departed from Shanghai at 8:50 AM and was carrying a large number of Japanese officials and some foreigners. The details of the explosion are not yet known. It is generally believed that the landmine was placed by Chinese guerrillas. Japanese officials in this city are maintaining strict silence on the matter, but have also admitted that "something happened." After the accident, trains to Nanjing were temporarily suspended. It is said that there will be no further train service today.

At Least One Hundred Dead and Injured in Explosion

A certain foreigner in this city planned to depart for Nanjing near noon. According to him, the train he was supposed to take was held up at the North Station for half an hour. A station clerk then informed the passengers that a train had derailed near Suzhou, so the train could not depart and there would be no trains from Shanghai to Nanjing today. A reporter contacted the Suzhou Railway Station by telephone this afternoon and learned that at least one hundred people were killed or injured in the explosion, and it is expected that many of the injured will not survive. As for the identities of the senior Japanese officials on the destroyed train, it is not yet known.

### Cold Weather Arrives: Winter Relief Efforts Intensify

Deep winter has arrived, and the severe cold is pressing upon us. Coupled with the high rice prices, the number of impoverished people freezing and starving to death on the streets is approaching one hundred per day, according to a report from the Pushen Villa, and countless others are on the verge of death. The first step in the winter relief efforts of the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association is to prepare a shelter to protect against the cold and accommodate the elderly, weak, disabled, and orphans. They have already rented a vacant lot at the Yan Family Residence on Diefeng Road, and are currently rushing to build mat sheds and sew cotton quilts and clothing in preparation for accommodating refugees. The shelter can accommodate approximately 2,000 people. This project is expected to be completed in three weeks, and then they will begin registering refugees for admission. The accommodation period will run from mid-December to the end of March next year, when the weather warms up.

Piles of Bodies Frozen to Death

The weather had been warm for several days, but it suddenly turned cold yesterday morning, causing many helpless impoverished people who were sleeping in the alleys to freeze to death due to hunger and cold. The Tongren Fuyuan Hall in the French Concession received telephone reports from various police stations and shopkeepers from morning to night, requesting that they collect over a dozen male and female corpses, especially children, close to twenty corpses. Previously, the hall handled the collection of corpses found on the road, with the expenses covered by rental income from real estate. Since the war, most of the hall's real estate has been in the occupied areas, and for more than three years, there has been no income. As a result, funding for this charitable undertaking is extremely tight, relying entirely on temporary donations. It is hoped that the charitable people of Shanghai will generously donate to sustain this good deed.

Account Statement Published

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, which is currently responsible for the food, medicine, and other expenses of more than 14,000 refugees in this city, published its income and expenditure figures for May yesterday. The total income from donations was 411,355.78 yuan, and the total expenditure was 379,608.63 yuan. The balance at the end of this month (i.e., the end of September) was 31,747.15 yuan in national currency.

### City's Cold Weather Clothing Donation Collection Deadline Today

Various Sectors Handling Collection and Submission Procedures

The city's cold weather clothing donation campaign, since the solicitation and consolation donation committee promoted solicitation in various sectors, people from all sectors have been united, actively donating, and various groups and organizations have worked together to assist in the promotion, resulting in significant achievements exceeding the recognized targets. The association has been ordered to end the process today, and will not continue. It also limits all fundraising groups and collecting agencies to complete all collection and submission procedures within the next week, so that the entire report can be submitted and concluded as soon as possible. The receipt stubs and fundraising report forms provided by the association to various sectors will be collected and verified in their entirety. After the conclusion, the enthusiastic groups and those with outstanding achievements will be reported to the central government for special commendation in accordance with the solicitation and reward regulations.

### Zhu Boquan Abducted Yesterday Morning

Yesterday morning, a kidnapping occurred at Haige Road and Yidingpan Road. The victim was an important figure in the financial world. The circumstances and public sentiment are described below.

Employed Bodyguard

Zhu Boquan, a native of Nanxun in his forties, is currently the manager of the Shanghai Bankers Association Joint Federation Preparatory Committee. His Shanghai residence is at No. 640 Fanyuan, Haige Road, West Shanghai. Because Zhu is usually busy with work, he has a private car, license plate number 8, and employs a bodyguard to accompany him for protection.

Abducted En Route

At around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Zhu left home with his bodyguard, intending to go out to work. However, when the car passed Haige Road and Yidingpan Road, three kidnappers suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, each holding a box gun, blocking the way. Then they jumped into the car and kidnapped Zhu and the car together, disappearing without a trace. After the police received the report, they immediately dispatched officers to investigate and have ordered a thorough investigation. As for Zhu, his bodyguard, driver, and car, there is still no news of their whereabouts.

### Meilehe Returns to Shanghai from Hong Kong

It is now reported that Meilehe arrived in Hong Kong from the Philippines early in the morning. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Hong Kong by ship today and should arrive in Shanghai tomorrow or the day after.

### Japanese Warships Off the Coast of Shipu Shoot at the Coastline

According to shipping industry news, a Japanese warship anchored off the coast of Shipu opened fire on the shore with machine guns at around 9:00 AM on the 28th. At that time, the Chinese garrison also fired back with machine guns, and the fighting was intense, with the sound of gunfire as dense as linked beads. At 10:45 AM, the Japanese warship was unable to withstand and fled north. The Chinese side suffered no losses. At 12:30 PM, another Japanese warship sailed into Shipu and anchored off Dongmenkou, but took no unusual actions.

### Approved by the Public Works Department: Additional Allowance for Chinese Constables; Retroactive Payment from November; Chinese Constables Generally Satisfied and Working as Usual

Following a request for salary increases by 195 Chinese constables from the Jing'an Temple, Gordon Road, Putuo Road, Xinzha Road, and Chengdu Road police stations in the Public Concession on the 1st, the police authorities swiftly addressed the matter. Considering the hardships of the Chinese constables and promising to make amends, the constables expressed satisfaction and resumed their duties as usual, faithfully performing their tasks. Yesterday's situation was excellent, with everything proceeding as before and no unexpected incidents. The details of the housing allowance approved by the Public Works Department are as follows:

Approved Additional Housing Allowance

The Public Works Department has recently approved an additional housing allowance for the Chinese constables in the patrol division, effective from November: (1) For mounted constables: A. Married and not residing in the police station dormitory, the allowance increases from $11.50 to $24 per month; B. Unmarried and residing in the police station dormitory, the allowance increases from $9 to $18 per month; C. Married and residing in the police station dormitory, the allowance increases from $9 to $18 per month. (2) For Chinese patrol sergeants: A. Married and not residing in the police station dormitory, the allowance increases from $14 to $26 per month; B. Unmarried and not residing in the police station dormitory, the allowance increases from $10.50 to $20 per month; C. Married and residing in the police station dormitory, the allowance increases from $10.50 to $20 per month. (3) Acting patrol sergeants and training patrol sergeants receive the same treatment as patrol sergeants.

Request Deemed Reasonable

Mr. Bavin, head of the Public Works Department's police division, stated to reporters that the Chinese constables are working as usual today, and everything is very calm. The Chinese constables now feel satisfied because the authorities have agreed to a pay increase, which has eliminated their dissatisfaction. Such events often have the potential to escalate into major strikes. However, the Chinese constables' request this time did not involve any actions that were opposed by him. In fact, he is willing to listen to any grievances the Chinese constables may have. Fortunately, the Chinese constables' work stoppage did not exceed ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. The authorities will increase the Chinese constables' income by raising the housing allowance, which will be calculated and paid retroactively from November 1st.

### Shanghai Silk Factories Completely Shut Down

It has been almost two months since the Japanese warships blockaded the coastal ports of Zhejiang and Fujian, resulting in the inability to transport local products from the interior and the lack of imported goods from other ports. This has disrupted the balance of supply and demand. Tea cocoons are a specialty of Zhejiang Province, and their annual output is the largest in the province. However, since the Japanese warships blockaded the coast, the products cannot be transported out, leading to a complete cutoff of raw materials for the silk factories in Shanghai. All existing inventory has also been completely used up. Therefore, all silk factories have declared a complete shutdown and must wait for the raw materials to arrive before resuming operations. The Zhejiang Provincial Government is planning to establish large-scale silk reeling factories to provide relief to silkworm farmers, which may be realized next year.

### Bank of China Increases Issuance of Dime Notes

Total Issue of $500,000; Initial Issue of $100,000

The difficulty of making small change in Shanghai has been completely eliminated since the Central Bank and the Central Mint successively issued large amounts of fractional notes and aluminum coins, providing ample supply. However, there is a severe shortage of dime notes due to the large demand, especially for one- and two-dime notes. This has led many tobacco and exchange shops to deliberately raise prices and purchase them at a premium, ranging from $1.60 to $2.00 or more per hundred yuan. The China Farmers Bank is currently continuing to issue large batches of new 25-cent and 50-cent notes for circulation in the market. The Bank of China has also recently increased the issuance of new five-yuan and ten-yuan notes, as well as new twenty-cent notes. It is reported that the total amount of the dime notes reaches 500,000 yuan and have been shipped to Shanghai. In addition to the initial issuance of 100,000 yuan, the remaining amount will be issued in stages to circulate in the market, in order to alleviate the panic of finding small change.

### British Nationals in Tianjin and Shanghai Eager to Serve Their Country

Eighteen to Join the Army in India; Saving on Christmas to Support the Troops

A group of over ten British nationals in Shanghai recently left Shanghai on the SS Sibajak, bound for Hong Kong and then the British territories in the Far East to join the army. This includes ten British nationals from Shanghai: Leslie, Harris, Wills, Dobson, Reid, Brown, Mahler, Hebard, Hoover, and Pullen. In addition, there are eight people who transferred from Tianjin to Shanghai to enlist: Satterson, Barkinhorn, Turner, Fener, McShea, and Clark. It is reported that they will join the Royal Air Force of the British Army in India. Before their departure from Shanghai, all their relatives and friends went to the Jianghai Customs Wharf to see them off.

Christmas is fast approaching. The British nationals in this port, due to the ongoing war in their home country, will not hold extravagant celebrations this year. The Shanghai British War Relief Fund has launched a Christmas troops support campaign from the 10th of this month to the 9th of December, collecting various comfort items to send to the homeland to comfort the British army, navy, and air force. The British War Savings Committee is calling for saving on Christmas expenses and promoting war bonds to help the homeland's war effort. The British Association has also sent letters to British nationals, calling for the suspension of celebration ceremonies and the transfer of celebration expenses to the war fund to aid refugees.

### Japanese Ships Anchored in Hong Kong; Nippon Yusen Kaisha Has Not Acknowledged It Yet, But Says All Ships Will Sail the Manila Route

According to the Zilin Daily, yesterday (the 28th), the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun evening edition published that Hong Kong is the outpost of the United Kingdom in the Far East, and is rapidly presenting the state of a military port. At the same time, due to the extremely limited import and export business, the importance of Hong Kong as a commercial port is reduced. Nippon Yusen Kaisha has decided that all its ships will no longer stop at Hong Kong, but will change the route to Manila as the end point of its trans-Pacific route. Also, according to the English-language Great America Evening Post, Nippon Yusen Kaisha has denied that all its ships will not call at Hong Kong. It is said that the company's direct Shanghai-Manila route will be opened on December 11. All ships will dock in Hong Kong on the way back to Shanghai.

British Ships Strengthen Safety Equipment

Since the German ship "Athens" was converted into a cruiser in Kobe, Japan, the British naval authorities have ordered all shipping companies to strictly take precautions in accordance with wartime laws. The schedules of ships are strictly prohibited from being announced. Recently, the Hong Kong Shipping Administration also issued an order to British merchant ships to strengthen radio and signal equipment. Any accidents that occur during the voyage should be reported to the British naval authorities at any time. Secondly, British merchant ships have automatically strengthened life-saving equipment and configured a large number of lifeboats to protect the safety of passengers and crew.

### Ministry of Finance Sets Five Measures to Strengthen Currency Confidence

In order to strengthen the circulation of legal tender in Shanghai and the credit of legal tender in the guerrilla areas, the Ministry of Finance, after repeated consideration and research, has decided on five measures, which have been ordered to be followed: (1) Maintain the circulation of legal tender in Shanghai and maintain the credit of legal tender in the guerrilla areas. (2) Omitted. (3) Strictly prevent the absorption of Chinese materials. (4) Order the competent authorities in various places to strictly prevent and ban the circulation of banknotes issued without approval. (5) A letter to propaganda organizations in various provinces should publicize that banknotes issued without approval have no reserve credit, and people should uniformly refuse to use them.

### No News of the Haifukumaru; Shipping Industry Concerned

The German merchant ship Haifukumaru, of the Reiss & Co., has already sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou and entered the Ou River. However, more than a month has passed, and the whereabouts of the ship are unknown. According to the Datong News Agency, the ship left the Ou River more than ten days ago, which has been confirmed by a telegram from the Wenzhou Haifukumaru office. There is no news about the whereabouts after leaving Wenzhou. Therefore, the customs declaration industry is rumored that the ship has been detained in Dinghai. However, judging from the fact that it has not arrived in Shanghai for more than ten days, the ship may have been detained, but it is not known where it is detained. It is suspected that the ship's radio has been monitored. Therefore, although the Shanghai company has been constantly calling by radio, there is no reply, which is very concerning.

### French Concession Housing Regulations; Seeking Agreement from the Consular Body; Whether It Is Considered a Kind of Police Law; Should Be Discussed at Length by Nationals of All Countries

French Magistrate Sheke, Resident in Shanghai, President of the French Concession Housing Rent Research Committee, recently drafted a decree on housing regulations in the Concession, in order to eliminate the malpractices of collecting small rents, and has sent letters to the British, American, and Italian magistrates resident in Shanghai, and the consuls of Belgium, Japan, and the Netherlands, asking them about their attitude towards this draft, in order to decide whether to recognize the draft as a police law, or whether it is attached to the national law of each country, and whether the civil laws that cannot be implemented in Shanghai must be modified. If the above draft can be regarded as a police law, then French Consul General Magre has the right to issue this decree, because the French Concession Police Department is under the jurisdiction of Magre. If the consulates do not recognize the draft as a police law, then the relevant authorities of each country must discuss it at length. It is expected that the French Concession Housing Rent Committee will soon receive replies from the consulate authorities, and then decide whether to submit the draft decree to the French Consul General for approval. The Public Concession authorities have adopted a wait-and-see attitude on this issue, and will study it carefully before discussing whether it can be implemented.

Pei'en Apartments Forcing Tenants to Move Out

Pei'en Apartments on Xiafei Road, which has a total of 110 tenants, has been notified separately by the apartment manager and the Pu Yi Real Estate Company that they must move out before January 1st of next year, with threatening words attached. It is reported that the apartment is the property of a wealthy Chinese businessman in Hong Kong. The tenants and Pu Yi Real Estate Company have been arguing about rent increases for several months. The landlord side demanded a rent increase of 35 yuan per room per month, but the tenants only agreed to a rent increase of 10 yuan. This matter was originally considered to be over two weeks ago. Unexpectedly, the real estate company then asked each tenant to sign a lease, with a valid period of only one year. The tenants did not agree, so the real estate company threatened them with an order to move out.

### Applying for Entry Passports to Various Countries Requires Purchase of Savings Bonds

Due to insufficient funds, it was originally planned to end the management from the seventh phase. However, the committee witnessed the soaring rice prices and the difficulty of the people's livelihood. In order to carry out its original intention and to follow the intentions of the authorities, it decided to continue to run tribute rice Pingyao to help the people in their urgent needs.

Pingyao Date

In order to negotiate specific methods, the Ping Committee held a temporary standing committee meeting at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road at 3 pm the day before yesterday. The chairman, Yu Qiaqing, first reported the purpose of the meeting and the planning and implementation. After discussion, in order to cope with the winter relief, the eighth phase of Pingyao will be continued in the early December of the lunar calendar, in order to help the people spend the remaining winter in hardship. However, a lot of money is needed. I hope that people from all walks of life and industry associations will continue to contribute to gather strength and work together for good deeds. As for the detailed methods, they are still to be revised.

Authorities Making Preparations

Yesterday, rice market rumors were out of control, and the gray market for domestic rice even shouted a high price that was difficult to explain. It is heard that rice merchants can make a profit of more than 20 yuan per bag. According to foreign reports, the rising rice prices in Shanghai are currently being closely watched by the Public Works Department regarding the development of the war on the border between Vietnam and Thailand. If the war expands, it will be necessary to import rice from Hong Kong and Rangoon to prevent food shortages, or it may be necessary to limit the sale of stored rice according to the population. Yesterday, more than 15,000 bags of foreign rice and 1,000 bags of domestic rice arrived in the city, so the rice price shouted high in the front market, and finally reported a return to stability in the back market.

### The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Has Not Issued Political Telegrams Recently

According to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the matters currently handled by the association are mostly within the scope of commercial proof and investigation, and no political telegrams have been issued recently.

### Rotary Club Toy Hospital Collects Children's Toys

Give Poor Children a Happy Christmas

Since its establishment in 1931, the Rotary Club Toy Hospital in this port has collected a large number of toys every Christmas and donated them to poor children. However, because the number of children is extremely large, all the toys are not enough to distribute. This year's Christmas is fast approaching. In order to make up for the shortcomings, the hospital issued an appeal to people from all walks of life the day before yesterday to actively donate toys. All new and old, good and bad books or toys are welcome. Because the hospital has a repair department, all damaged toys can be restored to their original condition for donation to children to celebrate Christmas. If you want to donate, please send them to the Rotary Club at the Duchen Hotel on Fuzhou Road, 1198 Jing'an Temple Road, 774 Xiafei Road, the West YMCA at 150 Jing'an Temple Road, or call 34120 and someone will be sent to collect them immediately.

### China One Trust Company Reduces Interest Rates on Current Deposits

In the second half of this year, the market has been flooded with funds, and various banks have successively reduced interest rates on current deposits. It is heard that China One Trust Company has reduced the interest rate on various current deposits by one percent from November 1.

### Shanghai YMCA Winter Clothing Donations Enthusiastically

More Than 6,000 Yuan Has Been Received and Sewing Has Started, Donations Continue to Be Accepted

Since the Shanghai YMCA began to raise donations for winter clothes for the poor in Shanghai, people from all walks of life have enthusiastically donated money, and more than 6,000 yuan has been received. In addition to urging charitable people from all walks of life to continue donating money to benefit the poor, the association has also organized a special committee to design and purchase materials and began to prepare them. They will be distributed to the poor when it is severely cold. At present, the main focus is on children. It has been learned that the association's clothing-making method is extremely novel. It is inviting family members of members and female leaders to voluntarily make them in groups at the Xuegeng Hall of the association from 3 pm on December 4, and can also take them back to sew or donate money for labor. It is found that the severely cold date is approaching, and I hope that all sectors will donate funds as soon as possible.

### Hong Xianfang Passed Away, Memorial Service Tomorrow

Hong Xianfang of Jiaochuan, who has served as a compradore of the Shanghai Race Club for more than 30 years, was kind and diligent, and everyone was happy to associate with him. He has contributed a lot to social undertakings and has spared no effort in promoting sports. He unfortunately passed away on the 28th of last month. Tomorrow (December 1st) will be the 57th day of his death. The family respectfully follows his last words and holds a memorial service and family sacrifice at the Fazang Temple on Jiale Road in the French Concession. It is also heard that the Siming Guildhall and the Longevity Association will launch a public sacrifice for him on the 22nd of next month (Winter Solstice in the lunar calendar).

### Paper Hunt Club Explains the Truth About Farmers Obstructing

Farmers Demanded Too Much, Changed the Route, Which Caused Misunderstanding But Was Not Serious

The Shanghai Paper Hunt Club wrote to this newspaper yesterday: Dear Editors of Shen Bao, I respectfully start by saying, regarding the news about the Paper Hunt Club published in your newspaper the other day, which is quite different from the facts, I, as the president of the Paper Hunt Club, in order to clarify the truth, respectfully describe the beginning and end of the incident as follows, please publish it in your newspaper to correct the situation. According to the dispute that occurred with the farmers at the end point of the paper hunt race last Sunday, the reason is that the paper scattering route led by me was one that had never been used before. If someone had warned our club about the farmers in the area in advance and objected to it, we would have changed the route to avoid it. It was only after investigation that we learned that the crux of the dispute was due to the following reasons:

Initially, I originally wanted the paper hunt route to pass through the village about three miles north of the marsh at the end point of Asanuma, because the residents of the village demanded excessive prices for the highway passing through the village, so the bridge slightly west of the road was used instead. Therefore, some of the villagers in the village incited the crowd, either because their demands were not met, and deliberately made trouble. That afternoon, several people from the village came to our association, expressed regret, and the village chief explained that they actually wanted donations from the Paper Hunt Club to repair a nearby stone bridge.

Farmers Have Always Been Positive About the Club

We rely entirely on the consent and goodwill of the farmers to hold paper hunt races. There are many ways for farmers to stop the paper hunt. At first, there is no need to throw bricks and stones, or use poles and sticks. The policy of our club has always been cautious. If the farmers really strongly reject the paper hunt, then the area will be avoided and not violated. In fact, the farmers do welcome our club, but only need to pay a fee for passing through. For example, the small beach used by us for jumping is also built by the villagers. Most of it is built by our club's workers, but without the permission of the landowners, how can the workers do it?

No One Embezzles the Price Given

A certain interviewer claimed that most of the compensation paid by our club to the farmers was embezzled by people, and the real landowners did not get anything. Even if they got it, they would be seized by the local tyrants afterwards. However, I have often walked through the countryside with servants for twenty miles last winter and this spring, personally distributing compensation to the villagers and landowners. There is no indirect procedure in this, so it can be believed that the money has indeed entered the hands of the landowners. Other children distribute in other areas, just like what I did. Not only that, the Chinese directors and Chinese members of our club have also contributed a lot to this work.

It is Impossible to Impersonate

All the villagers who receive money have a roster, which is checked every year to prevent omissions. When paying the money, there are many villagers watching, so it is impossible to impersonate or falsely claim to be a landowner and try to swallow it up. Moreover, the village chiefs can often express cooperation, so there should be no confusion among the villagers. It is likely that the villagers who caused the trouble in the area did not understand our compensation method.

Strict Prohibition of Damage to Gardens

It is quite wrong for someone to point out that we hunted in gardens with densely planted vegetables, because we will try our best to avoid fields planted with vegetables. When it is impossible to avoid, we stop moving forward and take a detour. Accidental trampling is sometimes unavoidable, but the damage is very small, and we must make every effort to compensate for the damage. With this, I respectfully ask for your editor's blessing. J.H.Liddell, President of the Shanghai Paper Hunt Club, November 29, 1940.

### Accusation of Fraudulent Acquisition of Property Against Yuande Money Exchange

Setting up a fictitious firm for speculative trading, fraudulently obtaining guarantee deposits, request to return to Shanghai

Recently, speculative ventures and silver firms have been established in this city like mushrooms after rain. Upon closer inspection, they are nothing more than specialized businesses dealing in margin calls and stock speculation. Huang Rongnian and Huang Aitang, father and son, managers of Yuande Money Exchange at 209 Beijing Road, along with Bao Tingcai of Xiechang Firm at 102 Renji Road, Wu Renji of Yongfuhe Firm on Shandong Road, Xia Dafang of Shuxing Construction Factory on Shanzhong Road and Hegong Road, Hu Shouqing of Kangsheng Foreign Firm on the Bund of Simalu, and Liu Jinbo, an accountant in the accounting department of the China Industrial Bank on Bowuyuan Road, have recently been sued in the criminal division of the First Special Court by Lu Jifu, residing at 19 Jifu Lane, Ximen Road, and Zhu Gengxin of Xinyi Company at 44 Yanghang Street, through their lawyer, Li Baosen, alleging

Fictitious Money Exchange

fraudulently obtaining property. The main points of the indictment are that the defendants, etc., fictitiously established Yuande Money Exchange at 209 Beijing Road, with the Huang father and son as managers. Yan Zhou, a runner for the exchange, solicited speculative business from the plaintiffs, etc. The plaintiffs, etc., unaware of the empty shell of the exchange, were temporarily misled. Lu Jifu then opened a trading account in the name of Lu Jiji on April 11th of this year, entrusting the exchange to deposit a total of three thousand yuan in guarantee deposits under the pretext of purchasing margin calls. Although the exchange claimed to have made profits, it was all just on paper and could not be cashed out. When he demanded repayment, although they promised to pay two thousand yuan, one thousand yuan was in the form of a promissory note that could not be cashed. One thousand yuan and a profit of four hundred yuan and ninety-two cents were not paid. Zhu Gengxin's portion was delivered in the name of Xinji, amounting to US dollars converted to national currency of 17,530 yuan and 8 jiao, plus 714 yuan and 5 jiao and 2 fen in Xinji's national currency account.

Upon Discovering the Deception

demands for repayment proved futile. Although one-tenth was later paid, as of May 2nd, 652 yuan and 1 jiao and 2 fen remained in Zhu Gengji's account, and 15,777 yuan and 8 jiao remained in Xinji's account, which were not paid. The contents of Yuande Exchange were hollow, completely pretending to conduct margin call transactions, fraudulently obtaining guarantee deposit funds, harming financial society. In addition to requesting legal punishment, a civil suit is attached, requesting joint and several compensation, etc. This case was heard yesterday morning in the Eighth Criminal Court by Judge Zhong, where only Huang Aitang and his lawyer appeared in court to respond to the suit. After the interrogation, the matter was postponed for further review.

### Discovery of an Englishman's Corpse on North Sichuan Road: Cause of Death is Heart Failure

The Shanghai Times reported that at 8:32 yesterday (the 28th) morning, the body of a Westerner was suddenly discovered in Lane 59 of North Sichuan Road (near Tiantong Road). There were no papers on his person bearing his name. The police department broadcast a description of the deceased's appearance. Subsequently, a friend of the deceased identified him as an Englishman named McPartland, born in the Arle district of Scotland, aged 65. He was formerly an officer in the British Army and has now retired with no profession. He came to Shanghai about two years ago and lived alone in Room 614 of the Naval Young Men's Association. He had no relatives in Shanghai. After the body was discovered, it was moved to the Public Concession Hospital, where it was determined that the cause of death was heart failure. The deceased's friend also knew that he had a history of heart disease, so the body was not inspected.

### Summary of Robbery Cases

### Zhang Gunian Returns to Shanghai to Paint Porridge Paintings

Mr. Zhang Gunian is the nephew of Mr. Feng Chaoran. He studied painting with his uncle from a young age and was intelligent, so he fully inherited his uncle's teachings. His works have long been highly regarded. In recent years, he has been working in the banking industry in Chongqing, Hong Kong, and other places, and has been tied down by his work, unable to concentrate on painting. Those who requested Mr. Zhang to paint continued to arrive. Mr. Zhang, realizing that it was difficult to balance both, resigned from his banking position, closed his doors to paint, and fulfilled the needs of his friends. Those who love Mr. Zhang's ink paintings will be able to have their wishes fulfilled.

### Youlian Radio Station's Famous Opera Singer Broadcasts

The Chinese Pharmaceutical Company's Fushou Dabubao Paste and Dabubao Pills, on the 30th of this month, will invite famous opera singers to broadcast Peking opera programs at Youlian Radio Station, and will donate a portion of the proceeds to the Zhendan Orphanage.

### Letter to the Editor

To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao,

I am writing to you regarding a news item in your local news column entitled "Our Home Robbed, Losses Amounting to Over Three Thousand Gold" which does not fully align with the facts. According to the check on the number of robberies yesterday, in addition to the five hundred yuan of cash, the jewelry and other items were approximately one thousand yuan. The damage suffered was not as large as reported in your newspaper. My family is not rich and is rather in outward show only. Anyone who knows us knows that we aren't really wealthy. The robbery took almost all the cash we had. The quote from your paper where "robbers fled out the door, while the owner followed and reported to the Chinese police" is also not in accord with the facts. Four robbers stormed in and searched every drawer for over an hour and a half before fleeing when the police passed by. The police were aware of the robbers' suspicious flight and attempted to arrest them, but they were shot at. One of the robbers was shot dead. Please amend this statement.

Respectfully, Jie Meisheng. 28th November, 29th year.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 pm yesterday stated that the weather in Shandong, this area, and the Chinese coast was cloudy and clear, colder, with strong northwesterly to northeasterly winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 pm yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 54.9 degrees and the lowest was 48.2 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 44.6 degrees and the lowest was 29.1 degrees.

Women

### My Mother is a Singer

— Hua Ping

Before saying anything else, let me introduce myself.

I am someone who has lived for fourteen years without a father. My father abandoned my mother and me when I was four years old, leaving my mother with no property, only the daughter he loved.

My mother is a very ambitious and capable woman. She didn't want to see the cold stares of my uncles, and she didn't want to beg for help from relatives. Finally, she took me to Shanghai to start her struggle. She struggled with the environment everywhere, seeking survival in the struggle.

Imagine a helpless weak woman, with a four-year-old child, in an unfamiliar place with no relatives, how could she live? But I have lived for fourteen years and have been able to receive a high school education. I tell you, I tell you with tears, now I am the daughter of a singer, I have been the daughter of a singer for fourteen years.

But I don't think this is a disgrace, I don't think this is a shameful thing. For the sake of survival, for the sake of preserving the only relic my father left my mother, my mother did this. Late at night, my mother often cried and told me about her pain! She said she was sorry to my father! She said she was sorry to me, for making me bear the unclean shame of the family. We always cried facing each other, until I fell asleep. The next morning, I would find traces of tears beside my pillow, and sometimes I would wake up crying in my dream.

Now I am grown up, my mother's fourteen years of hard work have been rewarded. My mother's sacrifice has been worthwhile. Like my mother, my face and body are quite upright. Whenever guests praised me in front of my mother, or when people in the crowd cast a glance of envy, my mother gave a satisfied smile.

This year I am eighteen years old, and I have formed a mature girl in all aspects, but I lack a girl's heart. I have no youth, I have no friends, I have no lovers. How can I bring my friends to my "home"? How can I tell them that I am the daughter of a singer? Although I know this is not a disgrace, this is not an unspeakable scandal, how can the ruthless society understand? Whenever female classmates look at me jealously, and male classmates look at me greedily, my heart beats non-stop, as if they have discovered my secret. Letters of pursuit are often found in my desk, and I always tear them up mercilessly. Although I can't be called "as beautiful as peach blossoms", I am truly "as cold as frost", although my heart contains the youthful passion that all girls have.

Oh my god, I have been regarded as a perverted neurotic. Who knows that my heart is clearer than anyone else? I want to expose myself frankly, but how can I endure the public opinion of society? I love friends, I like groups, but I encounter the most lonely life!

I am eighteen years old, I am not a freak, but I have not enjoyed the rights that "people" should enjoy.

### "What a Coincidence!"

— Zhen

I am confident that my desire for knowledge is not weak. When I have nothing to do, reading is beneficial. However, there are still many things that I cannot see through or identify accurately. For example, why is the world situation so miserable and chaotic? I really have no way to find a simple and clear satisfactory answer. Once, an old friend, leaning on a cane, came to my humble abode. After chatting about the world, he suddenly sat upright, sighed deeply, and said: Human beings are extravagant and licentious, and should suffer a great catastrophe. Therefore, the heavens sent down demons to disturb all living beings. He also cited several well-known world heroes, pointing them out as constellations; he asserted that great chaos and great killing were the destiny of heaven. Of course, this is not the answer I expected.

The day before yesterday, I couldn't help but exclaim in surprise. I casually opened a recently published magazine and found a piece of flowery writing entitled "What a Coincidence!" written by Mr. M.L. Mayfux and translated by Mr. Fang Xiaomeng. After reading it, almost all the hair on my body stood on end. I felt that it was not heaven, not fate, that could be so coincidental! Now, let me copy it below:

Too coincidental! I think it would be too weak and irresponsible to simply dismiss it with the word "coincidence". If we were to "trace the cause", I really wouldn't understand. Are these four powerful and wealthy people truly created by heaven and endowed with heavenly destiny? My first thought was that if this were applied to China, there would be a basis in the heavenly stems and earthly branches, with the five elements generating and overcoming each other, and the science of astrology would have some truth to it. My second thought was that Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek's achievements were no less than theirs. So I looked up Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek's origins, and to my surprise, I found that:

It really stunned me! What else can I say, what else can I explain, except to attribute it to fate! But then came a third thought. For forty years, I have served in the press and have prided myself as an uncrowned king; perhaps the uncrowned king's natural pattern is no less than that of the aforementioned dignitaries. So, I secretly tried to arrange it myself, but I knew that it was better not to arrange it, because after arranging it, I laughed out loud and almost vomited blood and died. It turned out that my:

Dear readers! It is not my intention to deliberately curry favor. What I have arranged is the truth! Compared to the famous officials, it is exactly the same. Where can I allow myself to belittle myself? Looking in the mirror, I am truly proud, but reflecting on myself, I am ashamed. Thinking about it, I can't help but have wild ambitions. Looking forward and backward, I can't help but feel lost; I have been sleepless for several nights until today. My youngest son came back from school, and he actually saw that I was restless, so I happily boasted to him. Unexpectedly, he frowned and said that this was M.L. Mayfux's deliberate cunning, designed to attract people. Adding the birth year to the age will of course equal the same year. Adding the year of ascension to the number of years in power will also equal this year. Dividing the two this years by two will still be this year. Using this method, everyone is the same.

Hawthorne Case

### The Ballerina's Fate

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 12 Report and Explanation

He said: "This old man is not only suffering, but he is probably going to die. But this is also the reward he deserves. He unfolded the two pieces of paper he was holding again. Mr. Jinshou, Songquan's report is completely correct. Those two guys are really fruitless. Li Zhifan has sent the money he got from exchanging the jade bracelet, diamond hairpin, and milk bead earrings to his son by express mail. Here is an express mail receipt and a money order receipt, amounting to 4,560 yuan." He handed the two unfolded papers to Ni Jinshou to look at.

I got these two pieces of paper from Li Zhifan's pocket at the corner of Qingpu Road and Datong Road. He told me about the two receipts at the time, but I didn't expect it to be like this. Ni Yushou waved to Songquan and told him to go out, then turned to speak to Hawthorne.

He said: "Mr. Hawthorne, can you tell me Li Zhifan's motive now?"

Hawthorne replied: "His motive is very simple. Money is the only theme, and there is also a partial associated effect, which I may as well make a temporary assumption. If I say something wrong, it would be good to have Li Shouqi correct it.

"I have told Bao Langer that Li Zhifan is a person with insufficient cultivation. He is used to a simple rural life. Once he stepped into the dazzling urban society, his heart was uncertain. He saw Wang Lilai squander and waste money like this, and his heart couldn't help but stir. He was Lilai's uncle-in-law, and she was also his unmarried daughter-in-law. The best thing would naturally be for Lilai to be willing to go back with them, but in fact, Lilai has also been completely changed by the environment, and their wishes are of course impossible to realize.

"This time, Shouqi came to Shanghai, clearly to resolve their marriage contract. I guess Shouqi's intention is still not to give up Lilai, hoping to complete this impossible marriage. Of course, Lilai would not agree, and may have promised to give him some money to dissolve this marriage contract. I certainly can't guess exactly what the father and son are thinking, but I expect that Lilai's suggestion may be approved by Li Zhifan, but Li Shouqi is wishful thinking, trying to get both money and people. But judging from Li Shouqi's shameless attempt on the seventeenth night the day before yesterday, it was finally resolved by his old man, which shows that Zhifan's feelings for Lilai have not yet been broken. Therefore, on the morning of the eighteenth yesterday, although Shouqi returned to Suzhou unhappy, Zhifan was still able to stay here. (181)

Entertainment Circle

### Hollywood's "Seven Flowers"

— Luo Cun

Peony Flower Bette Davis——Her figure and posture meet the conditions of "beauty of the times"; especially her pair of emotional eyes, which contain an unspeakable lure. On the screen, in addition to being able to play moving tragedies, she can also ride horses and shoot, drive cars, and ride motorcycles. Her attitude is very generous, and she speaks very easily, just like a peony flower in a garden.

Rose Flower Dorothy Lamour——She is born with full curves and an alluring charm. In "The Hurricane", she is dissolute, while in "Algiers", she is charming. Because she can be both dissolute and charming, she is like a "rose flower", although delicate and fragrant, but still be careful of its thorns, which will prick your hand.

Night-blooming Cereus Greta Garbo——She is a famous "mysterious woman". Her sharp and high nose is the biggest feature on her face. A pair of quick eyes and a contoured face are the representatives of her tragic master. In "Camille", she has an incredible "charm", which can indeed be compared to a night-blooming cereus, with green leaves and white flowers, full of mysterious melancholy.

Plum Flower Deanna Durbin——Her simple and elegant dress shows off her petite and exquisite appearance, and her beautiful face. She has a natural and beautiful singing voice, and she has won the elegant title of queen of song after "One Hundred Men and a Girl". The ability to achieve honorable harvests in "It's a Date" is all due to her ability to delicately depict the poignant and charming details. She can be compared to a poetic plum blossom.

Rose Bud Judy Garland——She is lively and cheerful on the silver screen, and she is indeed a "star of the times". She became even more popular after performing in "Meet Me in St. Louis". Her future is boundless! So I compare her to a rose bud that has not yet bloomed.

Begonia Flower Jeanette MacDonald——She has a natural loud and melodious singing voice and a light and agile posture. She has a large audience at MGM, and she has also won the praise of many audiences in her new work "Bittersweet". With her lightness and cheerfulness, she can be compared to a begonia flower.

Lotus Flower Merle Oberon——A plump and pleasing "oval face", coupled with two thin and long crescent eyebrows, a graceful figure, and a dashing and energetic attitude, she is as delicate as a lotus flower emerging from the water, so I compare her to a lotus flower.

### Famous Young Actor Yu Zhenfei to Participate in an Amateur Performance of "The Lion's Roar"

— Hua

Kunqu Opera, with its high art and small audience, is almost extinct except for the members of the Xiannixue Society. Mr. Yu Zhenfei comes from a prominent family in Wuzhong. His respected father, Mr. Suliu, was proficient in opera rhyme and was known as the "King of Opera". Mr. Yu inherited the family tradition from a young age. During his cradle years, he was familiar with the "Three Drunkennesses, One Success" and "Red Embroidered Shoes", which were no different from popular lullabies. At the age of seven, he learned posture from the old senior Shen Yuequan. At the age of fifteen, he made his first stage appearance at Lu Shunxiang's No. 1 Scholar's Residence in Suzhou, singing "Looking Home". Later, his father performed several times at the Yale Peake Theater in Shanghai to raise funds for the Kunqu Opera Training Institute. Since then, he has occasionally appeared on the red carpet. When Mr. Suliu passed away, Cheng Yanqiu was preparing to go to France to perform and lacked a young male actor. He strongly urged Yu to join him, and Yu agreed on the condition that Cheng would introduce him to Cheng Jixian as his teacher. He was exceptionally admitted and went to Beiping. The plan to go abroad was abandoned, so he stayed to study art. At the age of thirty, he practiced leg lifts, but his bones were already hard and he felt it was difficult to achieve success. Two years later, he switched to studying literary dramas and researching facial expressions, making rapid progress. Later, he returned to Shanghai and served as a professor of opera phonology at Jinan University for three years. At that time, Cheng Yanqiu made an appointment to go abroad again, so he went to Beiping again. Everything was ready, but the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, and the trip to France became a distant dream. In the year, he came to Shanghai with Xin Yanqiu and collaborated on performances at Gengxin. This autumn, he was hired by Huang Jin. The contract expired on the 21st. He originally planned to return to Beiping to join the troupe, but Mr. Ni Gaofeng's mother's sixtieth birthday celebration was held by his friends at Jingtu Nunnery in Guling. Mr. Wang Chuansong invited all the members of Xiannixue to participate in the performance. Mr. Yu and Zhu Fuming and Zheng Chuanjian will co-star in the finale "The Lion's Roar".

### Portraits of Female Artists

— Tang

(8) Zhou Lianxia

If we are to write biographies for female artists, then we should not omit Miss Zhou Lianxia. Miss Zhou is a famous female painter, female poet, and a master of the hairpin-style script. Her paintings are usually self-painted and self-inscribed, making her a triple threat in painting, poetry, and calligraphy. This truly makes Miss Zhou worthy of the title. Not only that, but Miss Zhou is also eloquent. In crowded gatherings, her arguments often flow freely, displaying her unconventional artistic demeanor. Once, I was at the residence of a certain master where I discussed the labor and inspiration of poetry with Miss Zhou. Miss Zhou expressed many valuable opinions on this issue; in terms of artistic achievement, she is truly admirable.

Miss Lianxia, courtesy name Ziyi, is originally from Ji'an, Jiangxi. Her respected father, Mr. Henian, served as the Prefect of Changsha during the late Qing Dynasty, so Miss Lianxia was actually born in Changsha. During his lifetime, Mr. Henian was very knowledgeable about epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting. Miss Lianxia received a family education from a young age, and was very intelligent since she was little. At the age of twelve, she began to write on fans for others and occasionally composed small poems, which were also quite remarkable. After moving to Shanghai, she studied painting with the old Huzhou calligraphy master Zheng Husu, and national studies with the Yixing scholar Jiang Meisheng. This finally gave her excellent talent the opportunity to be tempered, thereby reaching the realm of success. In her paintings, she is skilled in landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, insects and fish. Recently, the Chinese Women's Painting Association held its seventh exhibition. She participated in the exhibition with "Early Court of the Golden Palace", "Celestial Music in the Guanghan Palace", "Longevity Chart", and several flower screens. Every brushstroke was exquisite, especially the vibrant colors, which made the paintings appear particularly charming and brilliant. Among them, the "Longevity Chart" was appreciated by Yu Qiaqing, who ordered it for a price of one hundred and ten yuan. In addition, there were several lady fan surfaces, adorned with small regular script, shaped like fan bones, which were novel and pleasing to the eye, and were also all ordered. This exhibition lasted for five days, and as a result, Miss Lianxia's ordered works ranked first, accounting for more than one-seventh of the entire exhibition, which shows how much her artistic skills are valued.

Besides immersing herself in artistic endeavors, Miss Lianxia's only hobby is collecting photographs. Her boudoir contains more than a dozen albums filled with all kinds of photographs, many of which are valuable photos. Miss Lianxia regards it as a kind of artistic asset. In addition, she also loves to dance and watch movies, but when she is at home, she is proficient in cooking and sewing. She is truly a versatile and multi-talented modern woman.

Black First

The seventh-rank cannon against the elephant pawn formation. The method of play is listed below: pawn 3 advances 1, horse 2 advances 3, chariot 1 moves to the center 2, chariot 2 retreats 1, cannon 8 moves to the center 3, cannon 5 advances 4, chariot 2 moves to the center 4, pawn 9 advances 1, cannon 8 moves to the center 7, horse 8 advances 9, horse 8 advances 9, pawn 3 moves to the center 2, chariot 2 advances 5, scholar 4 advances 5, horse 6 advances 5, elephant 1 retreats 3, cannon 2 moves to the center 5, chariot 1 moves to the center 2, elephant 3 advances 1, horse 9 advances 7, horse 9 retreats 8, minister 7 advances 5, elephant 7 advances 5, pawn 9 advances 1, cannon 2 moves to the center 5, chariot 9 moves to the center 8, pawn 7 advances - pawn 2 advances 1, horse 7 advances 6, horse 8 advances 7, pawn 3 advances 1, pawn 1 advances 1, horse 2 advances 3, chariot 2 advances 6, pawn 3 advances 1, cannon 7 advances 5, cannon 3 advances 1, cannon 5 retreats 2, chariot 4 advances 6, chariot 9 advances 5, horse 7 advances 5, cannon 5 advances 1. The explanation is that in this game, the black side advances pawns first, then cannons, so the red side also adds a central cannon to counter its attack. If the red side responds with a horse or elephant head, it is difficult to gain the upper hand. The red chariot advancing 6 is a preemptive move, preventing the black cannon from advancing 6 first, so pawn 7 advances 1, and chariot 2 retreats 1, and horse 9 advances 7, are all preemptive moves. The black chariot moving to the center 4, forcing the horse to exchange cannons, is also a stable move. At this point, the forces on both sides are balanced.
