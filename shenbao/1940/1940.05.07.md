Shashi: Japanese troops who raided northward from Zhongxiang and Yangzi were divided into separate forces. One force was severely attacked by the Chinese army near Changshou Town, suffering heavy casualties. The Japanese reinforced their attack, retreating to Shahe Town (northwest of Changshou Town) and Majiaji (north of Changshou Town), where they were again ambushed by the Chinese army from both sides, resulting in a disastrous retreat. The Chinese army is currently in pursuit. Another force retreated from Zhongxiang to the vicinity of Fengle River and was ambushed by the Chinese army. After a day and night of bloody fighting, countless enemies were annihilated. Combat continues. Another force retreated from Dongqiao north, once capturing Zhangjiaji. On the morning of the fifth, a powerful Chinese unit launched a fierce attack from the side, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops fled in disarray, and Zhangjiaji was immediately recaptured. The unit has now advanced to the rear of the Beijing-Zhongxiang Road, completely cutting off the road. Another Chinese unit has been pursuing the Japanese army for several days with great success. On the second, near Yangjiaji, southeast of Jiukou, the unit successively defeated the Japanese troops who had raided from Tianjia Yuan, Linjiaji, and Jiukou strongholds, killing over five hundred Japanese soldiers. The Chinese army is expanding its victories while advancing north across the Hanyi Road, reaching the southern side of the eastern section of the Beijing-Zhongxiang Road by the night of the fourth, joining forces with the Chinese troops moving south, achieving the goal of cutting off the Japanese army's rear. The Japanese troops in Zhongxiang and Yangzi are now heavily besieged by the Chinese army. (Sixth dispatch)

On the fourth, the Japanese force attacking near Xiaolin Town (east of Tongbai) increased to over ten thousand. The Chinese army, utilizing the mountainous terrain, intercepted and killed the Japanese, causing great chaos. The battle lasted until the fifth, with over two thousand Japanese soldiers annihilated. The large Chinese army that advanced behind the Japanese has recaptured the Xishuanghe stronghold (west of Xinyang), establishing contact with the Chinese armies east and west of the Pinghan Railway. The Chinese army continued to advance fiercely towards Xinyang, again cutting off the Japanese army's retreat route. (Sixth dispatch)

The Chinese army is closely pursuing and annihilating them and is using its main force to completely encircle the Japanese along the Pinghan Railway. At the same time, a Chinese military commander took the lead and attacked Shigunghe (east of Biyang), posing a great threat to the Japanese. The military's morale has been boosted.

Bai Chongxi also pointed out the Japanese attempt to build a railway between Qinzhou and Nanning. Bai Chongxi continued, stating that the Japanese are now using pro-Japanese Chinese to develop their economic exploitation in China and to destroy Chinese legal tender. Therefore, the Chinese people should also launch a counteroffensive from the economic front. (Sixth United Press dispatch)

Editorial

### Italy and the European War

Civilized people unanimously hope that the European war will not be prolonged or expanded, but trends indicate that the hope of non-prolongation is gone, and the hope of non-expansion is nearly gone.

As far as the current situation is concerned, the possible direction of expansion is in the Mediterranean, and the critical juncture for expansion is in Italy. The Pope fervently prayed yesterday: "May God protect Italy from the scourge of war." It is said that he was tearful when praying. The Pope's prayer evokes great sympathy in anyone and makes anyone more deeply aware that Italy is about to participate in the war. We do not know how God will rule? We do not know how Prime Minister Mussolini, who rules Italy, will decide!

Three weeks ago, Mr. Ansaldo, the manager of the newspaper "Electrical News" and an organ of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, broadcasted a speech to the Italian army, saying that "Italy should prepare for war to break out within one or two weeks." This newspaper then speculated that "it can be regarded as the victory or defeat of the Nordic war situation will be decided within one or two weeks." Indeed, we observed Italy's attitude, which must take the victory or defeat of the Nordic war situation as a turning point. Now, the Allied forces of Britain and France have unfortunately been defeated in Northern Europe. As a result, the Mediterranean Sea is turbulent, and Italy is preparing for war. In recent days, Italy has both announced an additional military expenditure of 800 million lira and declared that 800,000 Italian troops are standing by and 340 Italian ships are ready to take action when the war extends to the Mediterranean. All these gestures can be seen as Italy is about to take action, at least in response to Britain and France's increased defense in Alexandria. It can also be seen that this wanting to but not acting is Italy's way of coercing Britain and France. Originally, Italy called itself a "have-not" country, so it has always been full of complaints about the "have" countries of Britain and France. It hopes to take the opportunity to extort them in order to satisfy its economic interests and territorial desires. It was in tune with Germany before the war, and it maintains its close relationship during the war. The difference is that Germany uses force to achieve its goals, while Italy waits for Germany's victory to achieve its goals from it. Gaida, the spokesperson of the Italian Fascist Party, once pointed out that Italy's needs are nothing more than two: one is the need for free and abundant space for the development of the Italian people, so that they can work peacefully within the territory of Italy, and the other is the need for the Italian nation to live and act freely, and there should be a system that eliminates all foreign control. The former refers to the interests on both sides of the Mediterranean, and the latter refers to the rights of the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. In the superficial attitude, it shows that Italy has the power to fight for these two needs. It has repeatedly said that it is ready to participate in the war, which is the meaning of this. In other words, it also means that if Britain and France can satisfy what it needs, then Italy can live by peaceful work from now on, that is, it will not participate in the war. But what about Britain and France?

Britain and France's current move of their fleet to the Mediterranean cannot be regarded as Britain and France's response to Italy's demands, nor can it be regarded as Britain and France's threat to Italy. Originally, France under Daladier followed Britain's Chamberlain in everything, and compromise with Italy was Chamberlain's consistent policy. It was first seen in the recognition of the Italian Empire, and then in the compromise in the Spanish incident. Recent news from The Hague also said that Britain is seeking contact with Italy in order to obtain understanding, and it is willing to consider Italy's position in the Mediterranean and the shipping in the Suez Canal. However, Britain and France do not have the best credibility with Italy, so the concern expressed by Britain cannot win Italy's trust. Moreover, the so-called concern cannot be interpreted as giving Italy satisfaction. And US President Roosevelt's efforts for peace and his expression of unwillingness to expand the war to the Mediterranean can of course make Mussolini think more, but in terms of weight, it is not enough to prompt Mussolini to change his mind!

According to British and French propaganda, Germany has recently strengthened its pressure on Italy, making Italy more inclined to Germany. This kind of statement is either a lie or an irrelevant statement. Italy will never accept oppression in the middle of this European war, and the great powers will not support the oppressed in their time of need. The most likely attitude is to add flowers to the brocade and participate in the work of oppression! If the British and French had the absolute advantage in the Nordic war situation a few days ago, we firmly believe that the Mediterranean would still be calm. Unfortunately, the Nordic war situation is not as small as Britain and France wished, and fortunately Britain and France have not completely lost in Northern Europe, but only suffered a setback, so whether the war will expand to the Mediterranean is still left with some room for hesitation. What is worrying is that the facts do not allow for such hesitation to last long. As for how it will develop and how it will tend, I don't want to discuss it too much, but that Britain and France will have to make more difficult sacrifices can be asserted in the middle of this European war.

### Sino-Japanese War Will Form a War of Attrition; American Newspaper Says Chinese Military Strength Is Great; The Current Situation Seems To Be the Prelude to a Major War

New York: The New York National Voice Forum newspaper recently published an editorial saying that the Sino-Japanese War will form a war of attrition. The newspaper said that although the war may be prolonged and endless, the current situation seems to be the prelude to a major war that will soon occur. China now has a strong and powerful army. This army is sufficient to be self-sufficient and has a large number of small arms. However, because the Chinese army cannot obtain the heavy weapons necessary for large-scale warfare, its operations are often hampered. It seems that both sides in the war want to wage a war of attrition, hoping that the other side will lose its fighting power. China hopes that the Japanese army will divert its attention to all aspects, while Japan hopes that the people will return to the "Nanjing government" and that the National Government in Chongqing will disintegrate. However, the newspaper also said that according to Foreign Minister Arita's speech on Saturday, Japan seems to have felt that the achievements of the "Nanjing government" are very slim. In that case, the Japanese army will continue to fight, and its victory is still far away. (Sixth United Press Dispatch)

### Japanese Economic Situation Is Turbulent and Unstable; Resource Mobilization Plan Is Difficult to Draft

Tokyo: The draft of this year's resource mobilization plan was approved by the Planning Agency on the first of this month and will be submitted to the Cabinet meeting for discussion. According to news published in the local newspapers, it is very difficult to draft a full-year plan due to the turbulent domestic and international economic situation. Therefore, this draft is limited to the first quarter of this fiscal year, that is, from April to June of this year. According to last year's plan, rice was the main crop, but this year, in addition to rice, it also includes important necessities, such as firewood and sugar. In addition, the price determination committee is currently studying restrictions on purchases and may also include fresh fish and vegetables.

### Tianjin Silver Problem Has Not Yet Been Resolved; Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Talks

(Fifth Havas Dispatch) When a reporter asked the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman in Tokyo today about a report that Japanese Foreign Minister Koya Masayuki and British Ambassador Craig had met on Saturday and Sunday and had completely compromised on the Tianjin silver problem, the spokesman replied that there had been some progress, but that he could not say for sure when the problem would be resolved, because some minor issues had not yet been resolved. When asked if the Japanese government would take any action on the continued decline of Chinese legal tender, the spokesman replied that the depreciation of legal tender was a very serious problem, but that the Japanese government was not considering any action, but that he had heard that bankers in Shanghai and Hong Kong had held talks to take joint action.

### Japanese Merchants Raise Large Sums to Operate Tobacco in China

Small-Scale Textile Companies Will Also Be Moved to the Fallen Areas of China

Tokyo: Three well-known Japanese tobacco companies have decided to organize a trust to operate tobacco business in China. The capital is set at 127 million Japanese yen.

Tokyo: The Japan Cotton Textile Industry Association plans to move the smaller textile companies under its jurisdiction to the fallen areas of China. The Japanese military authorities in Central China have already given their support. The Asahi Shimbun reported that due to the shortage of cotton, the output of cotton textiles of Japanese textile companies in Tianjin has decreased by 60%, and the output of Japanese companies in Qingdao has also decreased by 50%. However, because the selling price of cotton textiles is higher, the business of each company can still maintain a good state. (Fifth Havas Dispatch)

### Japanese Naval Ministry Holds Meeting to Discuss Warship Issues

### Japanese Foreign Minister Arita Admits That Difficulties Are Overwhelming; Reprimands the Foolish Excesses of Frivolous Elements; Striving to Adjust Relations with the United States and the Soviet Union

Tokyo: Foreign Minister Arita spoke at the Japan International Association, discussing Japan's neutral position in the European war and the foolish excesses of frivolous elements. He said that after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the political phenomena in our relations with third countries were roughly the same as after the September 18th Incident. At that time, some Japanese advocated occupying China, and now we have occupied Manchuria. After Stimson made his statement, these people, out of momentary anger, sang the high-pitched tune of punishing the United States. Today, we hear this again. This kind of foolish excess cannot be allowed to spread for even a moment. It is important to know that Japan's foreign policy at that time was focused on resolving the Soviet-Japanese dispute and adjusting Japan's relations with Britain and the United States. The spread of the Sino-Japanese War caused friction between Japan and second countries. As a result, the voices of chaos filled the ears again. First, it was to start a war with the Soviet Union, and then it was to punish Britain and the United States. This kind of reckless suggestion cannot be part of foreign policy at all. When Japan is promoting its policy at home, it must adjust relations with other great powers. The Soviet Union is currently implementing a program of production expansion, so it advocates peace abroad, knowing that it is disadvantageous to engage in war until its strength is strong. We also hold the same attitude and intend to adjust relations with the Soviet Union. What is especially important is the relationship with the United States. Although the American people's feelings towards Japan are very bad, we must not anger them. As for Japan's neutrality when it is at war with its neighboring countries, it has no experience, so the people lack the training of neutrality. For this reason, when incidents like the Asama Maru occur, there is an uproar. In the current European war, the belligerent countries will inevitably infringe on the rights of neutral countries. Japan finds it difficult to preserve the rights of its neutral countries. At this time, the people must understand the true nature of the overall situation and calmly deal with all the difficulties.

### Amidst Tense Mediterranean Situation, The Pope Tries Hard To Stop Italy From Joining The War. The Pope Met With The Italian Crown Prince Yesterday To Discuss The General Situation. The British Ambassador To Italy Has Departed To Return To His Post. Balkan Governments Have Exchanged Opinions For Days.

Vatican. The Italian Crown Prince and his Princess saw the Pope today, and they talked for thirty-five minutes. Then they went to see Vatican State Secretary Archbishop Maglione, and talked for a moment. After that, they went to St. Peter's Basilica to pray. When they left the Basilica, the crowds gathered outside cheered enthusiastically. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

Rome. While Italian newspapers and radio stations were fiercely attacking Britain and France, the Pope of Rome made great efforts to fight against this war mood. In order to prevent Italy from joining the war, the Pope of Rome met yesterday with Italian Prince Umberto and Princess Marie-José, to discuss it, and said that Italy should remain neutral. (6th Universal News Agency Dispatch)

Rome. According to reliable sources from the Vatican today, Pope Pius believes that Italy's recent entry into the war is beyond doubt. It is reported that the Pope is deeply pessimistic about Italy's future policy and its possible consequences. Yesterday, a priest who heard the Pope speak in the Nive Church said that the Pope was in tears when he prayed to God "to protect Italy from the ravages of war." (6th United Press Dispatch)

London. British Ambassador to Italy Sir Roland is scheduled to return to Rome today to resume diplomatic talks. Diplomatic sources here recently stated that the recent attacks on Britain and France by Italian newspapers have intensified, so the mission of Ambassador Roland's trip is very difficult. It is reported that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano met with Counselor Charles of the British Embassy in Italy a few days ago and expressed surprise at the preventive measures taken by Britain in the Mediterranean, and said that Italy's attitude remained the same, and Britain did not need to take these measures. Later, Britain and France took other preventive measures, especially sending a fleet to Alexandria, Egypt. The Italian diplomatic authorities re-submitted their inquiries to Britain, asking for the truth, but Britain and France decided not to change their policies before the tone of Italian newspapers and the so-called "people's" demonstrations were improved. Observers believe that Italy's actions are two-pronged: on the one hand, providing guarantees to appease people's hearts, and on the other hand, adding threats to the negotiating countries. For this reason, although the government has provided guarantees to Yugoslavia that it will not infringe on its territory, the Yugoslav government and Britain and France still expressed doubts. In short, although the current crisis is not imminent, it is necessary to take the maximum preventive measures. Even if this crisis cannot be eliminated in one fell swoop, it can at least delay its onset. In addition, the general public is satisfied with Turkey's adherence to the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey, believing that Turkey is worthy of being the mainstay of Southeast Europe.

Istanbul, Turkey. The "Yeni Sabah Newspaper" here recently published a report that it is rumored that 50,000 Italian troops are now concentrated on the Italian-owned Dodecanese Islands in the Mediterranean, ready to land on the Turkish coast at any time.

### British Ambassador to Turkey Visits Bulgarian Government, Rumored to Make Three Suggestions

Sofia. British Ambassador to Turkey Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen is visiting here. Yesterday, he and the country's Minister to Bulgaria, Ryle, went to the suburbs for a tour. The content of the talks between Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen and King Boris the day before is being kept secret here.

Istanbul, Turkey. The Turkish Republican Newspaper carried this morning that Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen made three suggestions to the Bulgarian government on behalf of the British government, as the price for Bulgaria to participate in the Balkan anti-German united front: (1) Expand trade between Britain and Bulgaria; (2) Britain grants Bulgaria credit loans; (3) Britain will come forward to mediate in order to resolve the various disputes between Bulgaria and its neighbors. After the last World War, Bulgaria was forced to sign the Treaty of Neuilly, losing a lot of territory, while neighboring countries expanded a lot of land. In contrast, Bulgaria repeatedly complained, using the slogan of restoring lost territory. Britain knows this, so British Ambassador to Turkey Knatchbull-Hugessen informed the Bulgarian government of Britain's suggestions and stated that the Turkish government is also prepared to assist Bulgaria.

### British Public Opinion Demands Improvement of Government Institutions. There Will Be a Great Debate in the House of Commons Today.

London. The attention of the local newspapers is still focused on the future debate in Parliament on the Norwegian war. Some commentators believe that before the government has the opportunity to explain its handling and answer many complex questions, it should not draw conclusions for the time being. The Times expresses its deep admiration for Prime Minister Chamberlain's energy and courage, but said that in terms of personnel, certain improvements should be made. In the wartime cabinet, greater concentration and driving force are needed, and more time is needed for forward-looking thinking. The newspaper also said that the concept that the wartime cabinet is completely separated from the views of various officials is no longer supported by most people. The most important figures in the cabinet should each have their own representatives, such as the recent example of the chiefs of staff of the three services (Army, Navy, and Air Force) each having a representative. These representatives can slightly reduce the pressure on the work of some cabinet members. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

London. A Reuters reporter stationed in the Parliament lounge claimed that no one is prepared to predict what will happen in tomorrow's House of Commons debate. The situation of the debate depends on the content of Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech and its impact on the entire House. It is expected that the three ministers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force will all speak. The natural way would be for either Army Secretary Stanley or Air Secretary Hoare to end the debate on Tuesday, and for Navy Secretary Churchill to end the debate on Wednesday. However, if a severe attack is triggered tomorrow, Churchill may come forward to intervene on the first day. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

London. The "Daily Mail" here recently published in a prominent position a letter from a certain anonymous but well-known member of the House of Commons. The letter also lists a hypothetical list of cabinet members. The list includes Lloyd George, who served as Prime Minister during the previous European War, and all major positions are given to Labor Party members. The list has Halifax as Prime Minister, Churchill, Lloyd George, and Eden as ministers without portfolio, Morrison as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Attlee as Foreign Secretary, Sinclair as Navy Secretary, Hudson as Air Secretary, Moore-Brabazon as Army Secretary, and Woolton as Minister of Economic Warfare. Well-informed sources believe that at the time of the British army's withdrawal from Norway, it is extremely important for the prestigious Lloyd George to take the stage. Even the conservative newspaper "The Times," which usually criticizes the Labor Party, also believes that this kind of important government reorganization plan that can consolidate the entire foundation of the government and represent the entire strength of the country has already become the general public's psychology in the past few days.

However, they at least know now that what they are doing is a real war, and all wars cannot be won by waiting quietly. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

Dissatisfaction in Canada over British War Actions

Many people feel that this not only shows Britain's failure, but also reflects Canada's own war efforts. Many non-official Canadians are too worried and uneasy about Britain's failure, so they complain. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

### Distribution of Food in Britain

Food Minister Lord Woolton announced today that, in view of the suspension of supplies from Denmark, the public must prepare for the possibility that the per capita ration of butter will soon be reduced to the previous amount.

### Anglo-French-Norwegian Allied Forces Encircle Narvik, German Planes Aid in Northern Norway with Over a Hundred Sorties, British Admiralty Announces Destroyer Sunk

Berlin: Today's German military communique stated that the enemy has transported more artillery pieces from the north, but there were no major military operations in the Narvik area yesterday. German military aircraft were active near Narvik, dropping a heavy bomb that hit an enemy warship, and also bombed enemy camps and ammunition depots. One ammunition depot was hit and exploded. German troops advanced northward from Grong, south-southeast of Namsos. Central and southern Norway are now quiet. The fortress built on Mount Hegra has been captured by German forces. Two British airships were attacked and damaged by German military aircraft near the northern coast of Norway. A British submarine was captured by German forces in the Kattegat Strait. The captain of the submarine was arrested. It was found that the submarine was severely damaged by a mine. Subsequently, a German patrol boat towed it into the harbor. In the area of Terschelling, German forces shot down two British Bristol Blenheim military aircraft. There were no particularly important events on the Western Front. (Reuter telegram, 6th)

London: A Reuters military correspondent stated that the Allied forces are now carrying out a well-planned offensive against Narvik. Before carrying out the bombardment, the Allied forces warned civilians. Although this is tantamount to notifying the German forces of the Allied forces' intentions, after the evacuation of the residents in the city is completed, the Allied naval commander will have a wider scope of operations. The German forces have built a continuous series of concrete machine-gun nests, which must be cleared one by one, so the progress is quite slow. The outskirts are not suitable for armored vehicles. German bombers will not be able to gain an advantage. The situation is similar to Trondheim, because the Allied anti-aircraft guns are already in place, and the German air bases are relatively far away. (Reuters telegram, 6th)

Stockholm: German forces are now trying to gain air superiority in the Narvik area. It is reported that no fewer than one hundred German planes flew north in one day. News of isolated resistance in central Norway continues to arrive. However, the only organized Norwegian army is said to be the division commanded by General Fleischer in the Narvik area, totaling 25,000 men. Except for a portion of 2,000 men who have been transferred to the Trondheim area to fight, the rest are said to be intact. It is reported that the Norwegian army has entered the Gratangen Valley and eliminated 1,000 German soldiers. According to news from Oslo, German forces have captured 10,000 Norwegians and are said to be using them for agricultural and industrial work in Norway. London estimates that the German forces besieged in Narvik number between 3,000 and 4,000. According to official sources, military operations in that area are still ongoing, but the adverse weather makes it difficult to predict a swift result. (Reuters telegram, 6th)

London: The War Office recently released a communique stating, "The war in the Narvik port area in northern Norway is still ongoing. There has been no major development except for some activity by the enemy air force." (Havas telegram, 5th)

According to news from Sweden, Norwegian troops have repelled 3,000 German soldiers in the Rofotnas area. The town of Aas is still burning after being bombed by German planes.

Stockholm: According to reliable sources, one hundred German planes flew to Narvik port in northern Norway this morning. It is generally believed that the German forces intend to launch a surprise offensive on the front line of the port, but it is widely held that the Norwegian 7th Division has been stationed near the port for a long time, and its strength has always been intact. At the same time, the number of Anglo-French Allied forces stationed near the port is also very large, so it is unlikely that the German offensive will be advantageous. (Havas telegram, 6th)

Stockholm: It is reported that fierce fighting took place around Narvik yesterday. The Allied land, sea, and air forces bombarded German positions in heavy snow. According to the Norwegian Telegraph Agency, a German giant bomber flew to Kirkenes on Saturday and Sunday and dropped bombs, but there was little damage on the ground and no casualties. People here believe that the plane's purpose was to scout the Kirkenes area to see if there were any Allied forces from Namsos and Åndalsnes. (Reuters telegram, 6th)

Stockholm: According to reports in local newspapers, about 300 German soldiers occupied Snåsa, about 50 kilometers northeast of Steinkjer, this morning. The German troops were well-equipped and moved quickly, occupying all public institutions within a few hours. Norwegian soldiers and civilians did not resist. It is said that the German troops seized military supplies and hundreds of vehicles abandoned by the Allied forces. (Haitong News Agency telegram, 6th)

Berlin: German military experts and a correspondent from the Haitong News Agency discussed the current situation of the war in Norway this afternoon.

The Norwegian Telegraph Agency stated that after the Allied forces withdrew from the south, the Norwegian army received orders to retreat to the north. Initially, they were quite disappointed, but they were later excited when they heard the official announcement that fighting would continue in the north. The Norwegian military headquarters is now located in the north. The Norwegian mobilization is still ongoing. The Norwegian positions south of Røros have not changed after the ceasefire order. In a recent battle, 120 Norwegian soldiers defeated three days of German troops. The German side suffered 35 casualties, while the Norwegian side only suffered 5 casualties. From now on, the Norwegian troops in southern Norway will only engage in guerrilla warfare. The Norwegian troops in the rugged Glomma River valley are determined to resist.

It is said that after the Allied forces withdrew from Namsos, British warships and the destroyer HMS Afridi (Captain Vian) were among those escorting the retreat to protect against enemy aircraft and submarine attacks. At dawn, enemy aircraft launched successive attacks in batches, but the anti-aircraft fire from the escorting ships was very effective. The ships transporting troops suffered no damage. HMS Afridi was hit by a bomb at that time and soon sank. All crew members have been notified. At that time, a total of two enemy planes were shot down. It is noted that Captain Vian was awarded a medal in April for rescuing 299 British sailors imprisoned on the German ship Altmark. (Reuters telegram, 6th)

If Norway accepts Germany's demands, it will be reduced to a German dependency. After the events in Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, Norway no longer trusts Germany's new promises. Germany has failed morally to the extreme, and no one believes its words anymore. Norway today reiterates the declaration of 1814, that the Norwegian people do not want to be slaves. Germany's attack on Norway was pre-arranged. Koht also mentioned that Britain and France aided Poland and sent 4,000 troops, saying that the Western countries have made a promise to liberate Norway. (Reuters telegram, 6th)

London: Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht conferred with the country's Minister to Britain, Colban, for a long time this morning, and it was decided that he would meet with Prime Minister Chamberlain today together with Colonel Ljungberg, the country's Minister of Defense. (Havas telegram, 6th)

### Renowned British Reporter Observes German and Italian Strategy: Italy to Invade the South, Germany Prepares a General Offensive

London: Renowned reporter Price recently published an article in the Daily Mail, stating that although Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will not declare war on Britain and France to aid Germany, he will seize considerable territory in the Mediterranean when the time is ripe. If the outcome of the war is a victory for Germany, Italy will permanently occupy this territory. If Britain and France win, it will be used as a basis for bargaining during the peace conference. It is generally believed that Italy wants to seize the Dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia. The leader of the Croatian opposition, Ante Pavelić, has been living in exile in Italy since King Alexander of Yugoslavia was assassinated in Marseille. Although the French authorities have requested extradition, Mussolini has always refused and may use him if necessary in the future. A senior Italian official said last month that the country would take action within 60 days. The date may be the 24th of this month, the 25th anniversary of the country's participation in the previous European war. In that country, people generally say that Hitler's concern is that the war will be prolonged until this winter and that US President Roosevelt will be re-elected in November of this year, so he hopes to launch a general offensive on the Western Front this summer. However, it is not impossible for Hitler to use a feint to the east and a swift attack on the Balkan Peninsula. In addition, Mussolini is now planning to borrow submarines and air bases from Spain.

Among the five human relationships, the mother-child relationship is innate, while the husband-wife relationship is the most emotional. However, although there are many loving couples, there are also many unhappy couples. The reason for the disharmony between husband and wife is due to the husband's declining energy, resulting from masturbation in early years and excessive indulgence after marriage. These youths often experience impotence, premature ejaculation, and frequent nocturnal emissions after marriage, and the sexual experience lacks joy and satisfaction. The wife's interest wanes, and it is difficult to have a harmonious love life. The treatment lies in increasing sperm and nourishing the blood, abstaining from masturbation, strictly prohibiting excessive indulgence, and then taking "Buti Kang," a German testicular essence tonic for men, to completely cure the problem. "Buti Kang" was invented by the German physiologist Dr. Mehlen. Its ingredients are entirely derived from the testicles of apes and are mixed with brain-nourishing phosphorus, blood-nourishing iron, and bone-nourishing calcium, and made using scientific methods. After hundreds of clinical experiments by Chinese and Western doctors, its effectiveness has been proven to be accurate, and it has been released to the public. Therefore, its treatment of nocturnal emissions, premature ejaculation, impotence, neurasthenia, stunted development, back pain, etc., is many times higher than similar preparations on the market. The female "Buti Kang" is derived from the endocrine of the ovaries of apes and animals, with the function of regulating menstruation and promoting conception, treating anemia and premature ejaculation, stunted development, and infertility after marriage, with miraculous effects. Couples who feel physically weak after marriage and suffer from the above symptoms will experience rejuvenating effects after taking "Buti Kang." However, those with nocturnal emissions should also take Ners Nocturnal Emission Pills.

Furthermore, the American United Petroleum Company has established an agreement with the Mexican government, tantamount to recognizing the nationalization of oil mines as legal. (Havas Dispatch, 5th)

Washington. After the Mexican government rejected the United States' suggestion to submit the nationalization of American oil mines in Mexico to international arbitration, Senator Townsend of the Republican Party proposed a bill (i.e., prohibiting the purchase of silver from foreign countries) to increase pressure. Townsend expressed this intention in an interview with a Havas reporter. It is also generally believed among members of Congress that although the United States government has no intention of retaliation, the Mexican government's decision is sufficient to cause adverse effects and only benefits the Townsend bill.

### American Educator Arrives in Shanghai, Speaks of China's Resistance to the End, The Stage of Japanese Negotiations Has Passed, Morale in the Interior is High and Belief is Firm

According to reports, a certain internationally renowned American educator recently arrived in Shanghai after touring various provinces in western China. He stated that the stage for Japan to negotiate peace with China has now passed. Chairman Chiang has formulated a plan to promote China's heavy industry, which within three years will enable China to independently produce all military equipment needed for the war of resistance. "The people within Free China are all optimistic and confident, and fully support the government's war policy." This educator has met with dozens of important figures including Chairman Chiang, H.H. Kung, T.V. Soong, Neng Yun, Dr. Jing Hwai-lin, Deputy Minister of Propaganda Dong Xian-guang, and leaders of the Communist Party.

Resist to the End, No Compromise

When interviewing Chairman Chiang, he inquired about the possibility of China manufacturing its own airplanes and cannons. Chairman Chiang replied that the Chinese government will implement this plan according to a set procedure. Furthermore, according to senior officials, Japan had asked a confidant of Chairman Chiang to convey a message, attempting to contact Chairman Chiang for negotiations. Chairman Chiang ignored the Japanese proposal. The Japanese attempt has failed. Government officials frankly admit that China has suffered significant losses as a result of the war. However, there is currently a common view among the Chinese government and the public, which can be summarized as "No compromise with the enemy, resolutely carry out resistance to the end, to seek national rejuvenation."

Economic Institutions Becoming More Stable. Government officials admit that China's final victory depends on four key elements: (1) money, (2) military supplies, (3) manpower, and (4) automobile transportation. The most serious of these is the issue of money, which encompasses the entire national economic organization. However, officials firmly believe that the economic situation in "Free China" can be readjusted through control measures. The large-scale relocation of factories and people to southwestern China has caused drastic changes in social institutions, presenting the government with many difficulties. However, the situation is now gradually improving, and given time, economic and social order can be restored, and the overall situation will become more stable.

Training Elite Troops Facilitates Transportation. There is absolutely no problem with manpower. There are currently four million well-trained soldiers, and new recruits are being trained every month. Regarding the issue of automobile transportation, there are large fleets of trucks in the north, but most drivers lack sufficient mechanical knowledge, resulting in negligence. Under the effective management of Minister of Communications Chang Chia-ao, the number of trucks has increased sharply. Chang stated that the main problem lies in training a large number of truck drivers with mechanical knowledge, who know how to repair and properly maintain the vehicles to prevent unnecessary waste. Regarding this point, Chang has ordered the establishment of repair workshops along important highways.

Chairman Chiang is the Supreme Leader

The American educator went on to say that regarding the political situation in "Free China," rumors of friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should be refuted. According to reports, such rumors are often heard by Chinese people outside "Free China," but they are completely unfounded. He had frank discussions with responsible leaders of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and knew that no one understood their common mission of defeating and driving out the enemy better than them. They are cooperating sincerely and striving together in various ways to accomplish this mission. Chairman Chiang has rapidly risen to the position of supreme leader of the country. He believes that Chairman Chiang, due to his position in the government, has placed himself above party or factional views, and has become the "cement" that unites the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

National Morale and Military Morale are Equally High

It is heard that the number of military supplies provided by the Soviet Union to China is very large, but the official information on the exact amount is not available. In his opinion, as the war continues, military medical care will become a serious problem. Private hospitals and independent medical teams have done their best to remedy the alarming situation caused by the shortage of medicines. The Red Cross is now formulating a plan to provide effective medical services at the lowest cost. What is more important than all the wartime activities in "Free China" is that everyone has the spirit of enduring hardship and seeking a bright future. National morale and military morale are equally high, because they embrace belief and optimism and do not hesitate to sacrifice. There is absolutely no talk of peace in "Free China" today. Everyone is united, carrying out the war as completely as possible. The war may last for several years, but he firmly believes that the Chinese government and people, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, will not end the war of resistance until China has completely gained independence and freedom.

### Today, All Circles Commemorate the May Seventh National Humiliation

Today is the anniversary of the May Seventh National Humiliation. Various circles in the Japanese city do not plan to have any ceremonies to express their feelings, but only to mentally encourage themselves, commemorate this painful day, and focus on practice, working hard in their respective positions.

### Run on Deposits Subsides, Financial Stability Increases, Foreign Exchange Stabilizes after Support, Ministry of Finance Plans Measures to Crack Down on Speculation

Reuters, Hong Kong, 6th. A leading Chinese banking figure told a Reuters reporter today that although the authorities withdrew support for the legal tender foreign exchange control in the Shanghai exchange market on Thursday, there is no reason to doubt the legal tender. This doubt comes from the activities of speculators, whose irresponsible actions will be condemned by the world. The Chinese authorities intend to continue to support the legal tender, and the recent withdrawal of support is only temporary. The existing silver reserves available to the stabilization fund have increased slightly, so the authorities are confident that they can handle the exchange situation.

Since the Chinese government declared its determination to maintain the monetary system and stabilize foreign exchange, and the bankers' and money changers' guilds truthfully denied restricting withdrawals, the market stabilized slightly yesterday, and people's hearts gradually calmed down. However, rumors have not completely subsided. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency specifically interviewed the secretary of the Bankers' Association and a member of the Money Changers' Association yesterday. According to them, the member banks and firms have been preparing everything since rumors spread in the market that withdrawals would be restricted again. Although the current environment is difficult, fortunately the strength of the banking and money changing industries is sufficient, so they can cope with it easily. The rumor that the banking and money changing industries held an emergency meeting on Sunday is false. It is hoped that all circles will not easily believe rumors, so as not to fall into the conspiracy of villains.

Shanghai's Capital Still Needs to Be Dispersed

A reporter from the New Voice News Agency met with a leader in the banking industry yesterday. According to him, the order and safety of the Shanghai concessions can be maintained to a considerable extent, so refugees from all over the country regard Shanghai as a haven of peace during the war. For two and a half years, more and more people have gathered, and the capital has increased accordingly, so the capital in Shanghai is becoming more and more abundant. Although the theory of transferring capital to the southwest has been very popular in recent years, although many in the banking and money changing industries have implemented it, large-scale transfer may not be achievable in one step, so how to coordinate and take care of dispersing Shanghai's capital and make it run on the right track still requires further efforts. The financial community should set an example, so that finance can gradually get on the right track, so as not to fail the government's expectations.

The Financial Community Should Set an Example. He also said that Shanghai's economic prosperity is contrary to the wartime national policy. The financial community did not examine it carefully, but only took its own superficial interests as a prerequisite, and provided as much assistance as possible, or used other convenient methods, to promote the abnormal development of the economy in the occupied areas. As a result, it violated the proper strategy of the wartime national policy, and some in the financial community even bought and sold foreign exchange and gold, hoarding daily necessities, in order to make profits. This kind of situation is a violation of government prohibitions, so it is hoped that the financial community should remember the government's difficulty in supporting wartime finance and the century-old plan of national life, and have a sense of their due responsibility, and promptly stop engaging in improper business, so as not to encourage speculation and affect people's livelihood.

Foreign Exchange Loosens, Gold Still Rises

Previously, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee restricted the supply of foreign exchange on the Shanghai black market, causing the market exchange rate to shrink sharply, and speculators rushed in. Yesterday morning, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation announced its listed prices: British exchange was three pence one two five longer one two five, and US exchange was four yuan five jiao, longer one eight seven five. Legitimate needs of various industries have been supplied. At the same time, the market believes that the Hong Kong Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has come out to maintain it, so the actual transaction market is higher than the HSBC listing price. However, the gold market rose against foreign exchange due to speculators' collection. The morning closing price was six thousand nine hundred and sixty-five yuan, and the afternoon closing price was seven thousand and ten yuan. The legal foreign exchange listing price of the Central Bank remains the same, without any change.

Withdrawals Subside, Finance Tends to Stabilize

Yesterday (Monday), after the banks and firms opened at 9:00 a.m., general depositors did not withdraw much money from the banks and firms because they confirmed that the rumors of restricting withdrawals were unreliable. At the same time, the financial market has stabilized due to the maintenance of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee and the interbank lending of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Agricultural Bank, and Bank of Communications, as well as the adjustment of the bankers' and money changers' guilds. It is also heard that the Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to the Shanghai black market foreign exchange and has jointly planned remedies with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Those who speculate in foreign exchange and hoard daily necessities will be investigated and punished, and illegal trading in the gold black market will be strictly cracked down on in order to relieve people's difficulties and maintain security.

The Court is Ordered to Strictly Crack Down. It was also learned yesterday that since the drastic changes in the black market foreign exchange last week, the courts of the First Special Zone and the Second Special Zone of this port have received instructions from Chongqing, ordering them to strictly crack down on speculation, manipulation, and hoarding. Those who have obtained solid evidence may be sentenced to long-term imprisonment or at least five years of imprisonment by the court.

### Soaring Prices, Drastic Reduction in Purchasing Power, The Apparent Prosperity of the Commercial Market is Exhausted

Shanghai's price threat is serious, and the apparent prosperity of the commercial market is increasingly exposed. According to a leader in the cloth industry yesterday, Shanghai's prices have reached an unprecedented peak, and people's livelihood is extremely difficult. The commercial market of various industries has also been deeply affected. Now, except for daily necessities such as rice, coal, and flour, which can be saved, the rest lack purchasing power. Taking cloth as an example, it is also a kind of daily necessity, but the selling price of cotton yarn has repeatedly risen sharply. Ordinary cloth has risen to the price of silk in the past. Citizens cannot afford three meals a day, so how can they have the surplus to add clothes? Therefore, the turnover of various industries has decreased significantly. The same is true for other department stores. If this continues, the commercial market will be depressed, and factories will reduce work, which is a major hidden worry for the future of industry and commerce. At this time when the authorities are about to implement additional donations, it is hoped that the municipal authorities will stand up and seek ways to save the situation, cultivate tax sources, and maintain the market.

The Attitude of the Authorities. According to reliable sources, the authorities of the two concessions will take considerable measures to curb the speculation and manipulation of merchants due to the soaring prices in recent days. The plans are (1) to establish a food production and marketing cooperative to handle production and sales, (2) to issue notices to inform citizens. According to the authorities of the French Concession Police Department, from April 15 to May 1, 23 out of 80 stores were found to be in violation of regulations and were fined 200 yuan.

Use of Law. Currently, the authorities of the French Concession are making every effort to place the market under their jurisdiction, so that citizens from all walks of life pay close attention to it, because the prices in the market are often lower than those in the stores, so if citizens can pay attention to this and criticize it closely, prices may fall accordingly. According to Mr. Ge Bo, Assistant Secretary of the Public Works Department, the restrictions on prices by the authorities of the two concessions in the past can be said to have failed, so it is believed that it is necessary to use the law. This means that it is necessary to legislate to restrict prices, if the black exchange continues to tighten.

Food Problem

The authorities of the two concessions are now paying the most attention to food and flour. According to investigations, there are still 780,000 bags of rice in stock in this city, which is enough to supply the citizens of this city for six months. The highest rice price set last winter was 40 yuan, but now the rice price has soared to 54 yuan. The Price Stabilization Committee of the Public Concession and the French Concession of this port has scheduled a joint meeting this week to discuss this matter. The rice industry believes that the main reasons for the failure of rice price limits in the past were the scarcity of sources and the restrictions imposed by the Japanese in the suburbs of Shanghai, so it is hoped that the establishment of a production and marketing cooperation mechanism can enable both parties to the transaction in this port to gather together and trade at the lowest prices under the supervision of the authorities of the concessions. However, this matter is still in the preparatory stage.

Selling Coal Balls at a Reduced Price

Since the black exchange in this city fluctuated a few days ago, coal ball merchants took the opportunity to raise market prices, and each load rose to nearly 10 yuan, which generally threatened civilians. Guohua and Dongfang Coal Ball Factories have now decided to hold a sale of coal balls at a reduced price from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. every day, with the price set at 8 yuan and 5 jiao per load (100 city catties). However, for the sake of popularity, each household is limited to one load. The method is to pay for the goods first, and then pick them up the next day. There are no cartage fees, but telephone orders will not be accepted. The locations of the two factories' sales are listed below.

Guohua Factory Sales: 6 locations, 394 Route Tenant de la Tour, 625 Connaught Road, 195 Avenue du Roi Albert, 111 West Gate Road, 819 Sinza Road, 269 Seymour Road.

Dongfang Factory Sales: 10 locations, Dongfang Coal Ball Factory Branch, 29 Langbing Road, and 203 Muirhead Road, and Yuanyuan Coal Ball Company Service Station, 155 Route Tenant de la Tour, 114 Maichiqi Road, 13 Annan Road, 467 Avenue Road, 117 Jessfield Road, 151 Rue Bourgeat, 199 Chihli Road, Edward Avenue Edward Market.

The Coal and Firewood Association of this city is experiencing difficulties in its business due to the high wholesale price of coal balls, which is as high as 170 yuan. In order to maintain the business of the industry, it has held a district registration to investigate the actual situation of various industries, so as to request improvement of the business from the large coal companies. It is heard that the French Concession is divided into three districts, and the Public Concession is divided into four districts. Once the registration work is completed, a meeting will be convened to discuss various improvement issues.

### Tea Exports Surge, Benefiting the National Treasury

At Times, the National Treasury Benefits.

Tea is a special product of China, and the annual exports are always in the tens of millions of yuan. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the National Government vigorously promoted special products and encouraged exports, with great success. In the first quarter of this year, the national tea exports totaled 164,270 quintals, with a value of 43,569,392 yuan. In terms of value, it is several times higher than the same period last year. Green tea accounts for the majority. Although important cities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have been occupied, the vast tea-producing areas in the interior are still guarded by the National Army, so tea production has not been greatly affected. According to Ningbo Customs statistics, tea exports in March alone reached 48,000 quintals, with a value of 16 million yuan. From January to March, the total was 95,028 quintals, with a value of 30,138,895 yuan, accounting for three-quarters of the total national tea exports. They are all purchased by the government's trade agencies and transported to Hong Kong for resale to Europe, America, and the Soviet Union. Exports through customs such as Shanghai in the occupied areas are less than a quarter of the total, so the government's wartime finances are improving.

### Under the Shadow of High Prices, Strive to Relieve the Poor, Various Charitable Groups Continue to Operate, Wealthy Merchants and Giants Should Donate and Assist

The Pi Han Suo (Shelter from the Cold) at Yan's Residence on Difeng Road in this city was established by the Joint Disaster Relief Association of charitable organizations last winter after borrowing vacant land from the Public Works Department of the Public Works Department. Since it began to take in poor people on the street on February 1 of this year, it has greatly benefited them. As of the end of April, it has taken in a total of 876 people. Now that the weather is turning warm, it was originally intended to end the operation, but in view of the fact that these people are the poorest citizens, once they are disbanded, they will still be reduced to the streets, which is closely related to social security. It has now been decided to abandon the name Pi Han Suo and reorganize it into a Vagrant Reformatory, hoping to give them time to reform them, provide education, and teach them production technology, so that they can become something in the future. The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry and Pharmaceutical Industry Association held a sale of plain rice at the Gion Dharma Assembly. Now that many poor people are buying it, it has increased to 7,000 catties per day. The plain rice sale at Moore Church and the porridge distribution at the Buddhist Association are also still ongoing. Since high prices make it difficult to stop the work of relieving the poor.

### Shanghai Rotary Club Celebrates Mother's Day

The president of the club is Qian Xing.

The Shanghai Rotary Club will celebrate Mother's Day at 12:15 p.m. on Thursday (the 9th) at the Cathay Hotel. At that time, Mr. R. Buck, conductor of the Shanghai Municipal Council Music Band, will be invited as a guest of honor. Mr. William H. Hastspan will also give a speech entitled "Mother's Day and Its Views." Several women have also been invited to participate. It is also heard that in addition to celebrating Mother's Day, the association will also hold a farewell party for the outgoing president Wang Fu and former president Hagenson. The association has now issued a notice urging all members to register the names of those they have invited.

### After the Increase in Public Bus Fares, Income Has Increased Compared to Before

The British Public Bus Company issued 35,000 yuan in substitute tokens and 160,000 yuan in substitute coins due to the lack of subsidiary currency in this city. Now that the panic of subsidiary currency has been resolved, the substitute currency has been gradually recovered. Two-thirds of the paper tokens have been recovered, and it is expected that it will not be difficult to recover them all within this month. As for the substitute coins, because they are easy to carry, they are mostly stored by passengers, so the recovery is still small. Since the bus fare increased in the middle of last month, the number of passengers has decreased by a quarter every day compared to the past, but due to the increase in price, although the number of passengers has decreased, the daily income has increased by more than 6,000 yuan, because in the past, the daily fare was about 220,000 yuan, but recently it has increased to more than 260,000 yuan. Regarding the resumption of driving in the northern district, the company authorities said that it is still impossible at present.

### North China Mailing Parcels, Japanese and Puppet Also Implement Control

Dazhong News Agency said that since the North China Organization implemented foreign exchange settlement for exports last year, all luggage parcels and goods under 100 yuan are exempt from foreign exchange settlement. Recently, the control has been tightened, and the value of personal parcels sent from North China to Central China and South China must be approved by the "Joint Reserve Bank" before they can be transshipped.

### After the New Exchange Transfer is Strengthened, There is No Need to Issue Exchange Transfer Certificates, and it is Feared that After the Issuance, the Public Will Hoard Them, so it Has Become a Prepared but Unused Item

Since the Bankers' and Money Changers' Guild implemented the new exchange transfer in July 28, strengthening the exchange transfer payment reserve, its preparation has been sufficient and has won the trust of various industries, and some foreign banks that refused to accept exchange transfers after August 13 have accepted them because of this. At that time, the banking and money changing industries had considered issuing exchange transfer certificates by the Bank United Preparation Committee in order to facilitate the daily acceptance of merchants due to the time limit of the bills. In addition to the fact that each firm could use the exchange transfer within its original limit, the Preparation Committee could pay the money of the drawer with the most connected industry exchange transfer bill with exchange transfer certificates. However, (1) since the industry preparation has been strengthened, it is expected that the exchange transfer certificate will be popular. If the general public trusts the exchange transfer certificate as much as they trust the legal tender, and they hoard them, the property deposited by various firms will be likely to be shelved, (2) at the beginning of the preparation of the exchange transfer certificate, rumors of circulating banknotes occurred on the market. Although the truth was clarified and the rumors stopped, it was appropriate to be cautious on the day when people were uneasy, so the exchange transfer certificate has not been used yet. Therefore, there is no need to issue it in the future.

### Western Countries Work Together with China, Japan's Reaction to Closing the Door to China, Ahlers Criticizes Japan's Plundering Policy

English Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that English Greater Shanghai Evening Post financial editor Ahlers, with the support of the Chongqing Diplomatic Association, recently wrote a book entitled "Japan Closes the Open Door to China," published by Kelly & Walsh. The book details Japan's economic occupation in the occupied areas of China and Japan's plundering and exclusion of third countries, which are not allowed to engage in normal trade in China.

Presenting Definite Evidence

The first chapter of the book discusses "Why the West Should Care about China's Economy." The main idea is that after the end of the European War, China's great economic importance has attracted worldwide attention. Considering China's potential, China's past and current economic status is not enough. From 1937 to 1939, the foreign trade in western and southwestern China was extremely prosperous. If the Japanese had not imposed air raids and naval blockades, China's foreign trade volume would have been even larger. The second chapter discusses "The Meaning of the Open Door," saying that this kind of meaning is clear, practical and to the point.

However, the Japanese are determined to expand in China, and the economic system, policies, and objectives implemented in the occupied areas are the same everywhere, gradually excluding Westerners and oppressing the Chinese. The "Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation" that the Japanese have been promoting for a long time is by no means mutually beneficial, but is entirely a one-sided "cooperation." It is only a pretext for the Japanese to plunder China's national and private property, in fact, forcing the Chinese to use their property to help the Japanese profit.

The remaining chapters of the book discuss China's shipping, railways, commerce, and trade, etc. One section states that Western countries are in the same boat, and even extreme friendly countries such as Germany and Italy have gained very little profit from their friendship with Japan.

### Fierce Gunfire in Western Shanghai

Audible Last Night, Shaking Windows

English Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that foreign residents in the Hongqiao district claimed today (6th) that they heard fierce gunfire near Hongqiao district early this morning, and the windows shook. It is probably that a striking team is active in the area again. The gunfire started at 2:00 a.m. and stopped half an hour later.

### Japanese Residents in Hongkou Formulate Punishment Rules

Illegitimate Profits Will Be Handled Appropriately

According to the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, the Japanese Consul General, Garrison, and Naval Special Marine Corps agreed on several punishment rules for Japanese residents at the Japanese Club on Pong Road last Saturday. Anyone who commits one of the following will be punished according to law: (1) Renting a house and subletting it to others in order to seek illegitimate profits, (2) Drinking excessively and making noise everywhere, (3) Suddenly acquiring illegitimate property in a short period of time, (4) Secretly selling opium, (5) Transporting various drugs to other ports.

### Six American Ships to Sail the Far East

The Shanghai American Foreign Trade Shipping Company, a subsidiary of the United States Westward Shipping Company, officially announced yesterday that, starting from August 1939, the company has purchased ships from the United States Maritime Commission for voyages through the Strait of Georgia and the Far East. Six of these ships have been assigned specific schedules. Their routes will traverse the Pacific Ocean, traveling to and from the Far East. The names of the six ships are "Cape Cleare," "Cape Fairweather," "Cape Corinth," "Cape Meares," "Cape Sebastian," and "Cape Seppings." The ships' routes will start from the Strait of Georgia, passing through Japan, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and the Philippines. It is also learned that the first of the company's ships to arrive in Shanghai will be the "Cape Corinth," scheduled to sail from the Strait of Georgia on the 10th of this month. The company also hopes to increase the number of ships in the near future.

### Carrying Gold and Silver to Shanghai Often Confiscated

It's Best to Transfer it to the Mainland, Don't Transport it to Shanghai to Support the Japanese

According to the Dazhong News Agency, when people carry gold and silver from the interior to Shanghai, they are often confiscated by the Japanese military along the way. On the 5th, a Mr. Zhou arrived in Shanghai from Changzhou by train. He claimed that Japanese military police in the train car inspected passengers for concealed gold and silver, checking everything from felt hats and collars to waistbands, sewn pockets, inner linings, socks, and shoe soles. Anything found was confiscated. It goes without saying that luggage, baskets, and crates were also routinely searched. Last month, a friend from northern Jiangsu Province who came to Shanghai also witnessed the strict search for gold and silver at the ports. If found, all would be confiscated, and any argument could lead to unexpected danger. The letter also included a few words: "Given the soaring gold prices and the Japanese facing financial difficulties, it is hoped that those who have gold and silver will find a way to transfer it to the interior and hand it over to the national bank for purchase. Do not violate national laws (as private transportation of gold and silver is prohibited by the government) by privately transporting it to Shanghai to support the Japanese, allowing them to exchange it for foreign currency to purchase military supplies to kill our people."

### Foreign Warships Gather in the Huangpu River

Nine American and British Ships, Six Japanese Ships

Recently, warships from various countries have gathered in the Huangpu River, their flags flying, creating a colorful scene. According to inquiries by the Datong News Agency reporter, the current ships berthed in the Huangpu River include five American ships: USS Augusta, USS Isabel, USS Luzon, USS Panay; four British ships: HMS Cricket, HMS Mantis, etc.; two French ships: La Grandière, Jarnac, etc.; two Italian ships: Lepanto, Carlotto, etc.; and six Japanese ships, including the transport ship Tokyo Maru and the repair ship Asahi. Among them, the American flagship USS Augusta, the largest, is particularly noticeable, anchored in the middle of the Huangpu River.

### Japanese Small Aircraft Carrier Moves to Mitsubishi Wharf

A Japanese naval small aircraft carrier arrived in Shanghai at approximately 2:00 PM on the 1st of this month, berthing at buoys 11 and 12 on the Yangshupu River. At approximately 9:00 AM yesterday, it suddenly left the buoys and sailed south, arriving at the Mitsubishi Wharf (i.e., the Toyo Company Wharf) north of the Hongkou Waibaidu Bridge and north of the Japanese Consulate at approximately 11:00 AM, where it docked.

### British Ships Traveling Between Europe and Asia Detour Around the Cape of Good Hope - The Mediterranean Situation Creates an Invisible Tension to Prevent Changes to the Suez Canal Navigation

Since the expansion of the European war and Italy's expression of its intentions, the Mediterranean situation has suddenly become tense. In addition to taking precautionary measures in the Mediterranean region, the British authorities have also instructed British ships that previously passed through the Suez Canal to detour around the Cape of Good Hope and enter the Indian Ocean. It has been learned that, although relations between Britain and Italy are unlikely to completely break down, all British ships sailing between Europe and Asia are now following the aforementioned instructions to prevent danger. The British ship "Shantung," which is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Scandinavia on the 13th of this month, will also detour around the Cape of Good Hope to sail to Shanghai.

French and Italian Ship Routes Remain Unchanged

France and Britain are allies, and tensions between Britain and Italy are bound to cause tensions between France and Italy. However, according to reliable sources, French ships sailing between Europe and Asia have not yet received detour orders from their home country, claiming that they have "taken certain measures" to adapt to changes in the situation at any time. It is also said that a French ship will depart from Shanghai via the Mediterranean Sea and return to its home country on the 8th of this month. As for Italian ships, they are still operating as usual, with no changes. The Conte Rosso mail ship, which is coming to China from Europe this time, has already passed Singapore and is in Hong Kong. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai around Thursday (the 9th) of this week and will return to Genoa from Shanghai on the 12th.

### Female Boss of a Guiding Agency Kidnapped - A Dispute Over Recruiting Female Guides Leads to Kidnapping as Revenge - Now Held on Yuyuan Road

The Yong'an Guiding Agency is located in the rear厢房 on the upper floor of No. 11 Jingqingfang, Guangxi Road. It employs more than 20 female guides internally and is a small guiding agency. It was opened by Gu Xiujin, a middle-aged woman from Pudong (commonly called "Big Sister Gu," 39 years old), and has been in operation for more than half a year. Wang Yiqiu and Ni Adi are also employed as accountants and perform their respective duties. At around 12:30 PM yesterday, Gu Xiujin and Ni Adi were suddenly kidnapped, forced into a car, and sped off towards western Shanghai. They are now being held at a certain location on Yuyuan Road. Details of the situation have been learned and recorded below.

Sudden Appearance of Strange Men

At approximately 12:30 PM yesterday, while Gu and the accountant Ni Adi and the tea boy Zhang Maosheng (19 years old), etc., were having lunch at the agency, three strange men suddenly broke into the room. They immediately drew handguns and forbade anyone from making a sound. They then took out handcuffs and handcuffed Gu Xiujin and Ni Adi, both male and female, forcing them to go downstairs, walk out to the road at the entrance of the alley, and forced them into a waiting car with license plate number 17906, which turned south into North Sea Road and drove straight west. Afterwards, the agency reported the incident to the Laozha Police Station, which sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and inquire about the kidnapping.

No Payment Given

On the day before yesterday (the 4th), at approximately 7:00 PM, the agency received a phone call from a Mr. Wang in Room 4 of the Dahonglai Restaurant on Four Horses Road, requesting two female guides to serve drinks. The agency sent Wang Yaqing and Zhao Yuexian to respond to the request. After the drinking became less lively, they accompanied the guests to Room 404 of the Dadong Hotel at 9:00 PM, staying for about an hour, and then went to the Xindu Theater on Yu Qiaqing Road to watch a play. Soon after, they went together to Room 618 of the Jielu Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. A plan to indulge in lust was unsuccessful, causing dissatisfaction from the two guests. At dawn the next morning, at approximately 5:00 AM, they called the two female guides back to the agency, but they did not give them any payment. At that time, the time was calculated, Zhao Yuexian for eleven hours and Wang Yaqing for ten hours, and the cost of services should have been 21 yuan.

Outburst of Roaring

Wang and Zhao, the two women, suffered this blow, so they used the telephone to report to the agency. The agency owner Gu Xiujin, along with the accountant Ni Adi and Wang Yiqiu, rushed to reason with them. Unexpectedly, the two guests had already called seven or eight people from other places. When Gu and the others arrived, they quickly closed the three doors of the room and slapped Ni Adi several times. Fortunately, Wang Yiqiu was alert and took the opportunity to escape, calling two street patrol officers from 1803 and 1756. The two parties were brought to the police station. After a preliminary hearing by the police chief, it was ordered that 21 yuan be paid on the spot, and they were reprimanded before they left. At 2:00 PM, after a certain colleague came out to mediate, the other party insisted that Yong'an pay 30 yuan to settle the matter. As a result, because the conditions were harsh and difficult to comply with, unexpectedly at 6:00 or 7:00 PM, they gathered 40 or 50 hooligans to cause trouble, making a scene. Fortunately, no major incident occurred.

Negotiations with the Police Station

Unexpectedly, yesterday at noon, three strange men suddenly came. Two of them held handguns, and one held a box cannon. They broke into the agency and handcuffed Gu Xiujin and Ni Adi, both male and female, forcing them into a car and sped off towards western Shanghai. Afterwards, it was learned that the car with license plate number 17906 belonged to the Xiangxing Automobile Company. The driver, named Yin Guoliang, was a local, 34 years old, and his driver number was 340. He has already reported the incident to the Laozha Police Station. He said that at approximately 12:10 PM, three customers came to the Xiangsheng Company branch near Zhaofeng Garden at the end of Yuyuan Road. The accountant ordered him to drive. When they reached the entrance of Jingqingfang on Guangxi Road, he was instructed to stop the car. The three men then walked into the alley. Before long, a man and a woman were escorted into the car and forced him to drive to western Shanghai. They are now being held at a certain location on 　　Road. The police have been notified and have ordered a Japanese police officer to go and negotiate and demand extradition. It is said that the other party has not yet agreed.

### Bloodshed at the Cosmopolitan Dance Hall - Xie Ziting Shot Dead - Shot and Killed Leaving the Dance Hall and Entering a Car at 11:00 PM Last Night

An assassination occurred at the entrance of the Cosmopolitan Garden Dance Hall on Gordon Road at approximately 10:55 PM last night. The victim was Xie Ziting, a local, over 50 years old. He was shot four times and died instantly. The perpetrators were two men who escaped without a trace. Details of the situation have been learned and are provided below.

Brief History of the Deceased

Xie Ziting, a local, whose style name was Qingmo, was formerly the manager of the Zhongfu Bank. He used to reside in Gouyu Lane in Xiaonanmen, Nanshi, and had a good reputation. Later, he moved to Fan Garden on Haig Road. He once held an important position in the former municipal government and currently works for the fake consolidated tax bureau. He moved to a certain residence on Dunxin Road on Great Western Road. At approximately 10:00 PM last night, Xie took a black-plated car with license plate number 9107 to the Cosmopolitan Dance Hall on Gordon Road and danced with the dance hall's star, Chen Mingming.

Murdered After Dancing

At approximately 10:55 PM, when the dancing became less lively, he walked out of the establishment and hired a silver car (license plate number 18270) to return to his residence. When the car arrived in front of the gate, just as he was stepping into the car, unexpectedly, two perpetrators suddenly emerged from Maibian Road nearby, one wearing a Paisley suit and the other a black long gown, and rushed to the side of the car. The man in the suit forcibly dragged Xie out of the car, turned his body around, and fired four shots in a row, all of which hit their mark: one shot in the right arm, one in the left armpit, one in the back, and one in the back of the neck. Xie fell to the ground in response and died on the spot. The murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled without a trace. Afterwards, the dance hall reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and transported the body to Baolong Hospital. The police station is currently investigating the cause of the shooting.

Eccentric Personality

When the reporter rushed to the scene of the incident to investigate, he saw bloodstains all over the entrance, which was chilling. It is reported that Xie went to the dance hall to dance every night at 9:00 or 10:00 PM and had an inextricable bond with the dance hall star Chen Mingming, which has lasted for more than four months. Every day, he signed a "bill," the English writing of which was "C.D.H.ia." At the end of the month, he would go to the dance hall's accounting room to settle the accounts himself. Chen Mingming later told people that Xie came here every night, and when asked about his family history, he looked sad and unhappy, and changed the subject. Moreover, he had an eccentric personality and was taciturn. General speculation is that his sudden shooting may be related to politics. When Xie was killed, he was wearing a light blue striped suit, a black silk handkerchief with white flowers, and yellow leather shoes. His hair was combed back, and he looked like a dignified upper-class figure. Although he was over 50 years old, he looked like a middle-aged man.

### Father-in-Law Accuses Son-in-Law of Embezzling Wood Planks - Defendant Released on Bail and Rearrested

Hong Xinghua, the owner of Hong Shenji Timber Company at No. 　, Anrenli, Shanhai Pass Road, is a local, 25 years old. Several years ago, through a matchmaker, he married the daughter of Zhang Jusheng, the manager of Yongtai Shenji Timber Company at No. 208, Luban Road, French Concession, who is from Wuxing. Recently, Zhang Jusheng suddenly hired lawyer Qian and accused his son-in-law Hong Xinghua to the Xinzha Police Station of embezzling fir planks worth 15,000 yuan. Yesterday, Chinese detective Sun Guihua and Western detective Litt arrested Hong and took him to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin briefly described the case, saying that the plaintiff and defendant were related as father-in-law and son-in-law. In February of this year, the plaintiff entrusted the defendant to handle 400 pieces of pine planks and 500 pieces of fir planks in Fuzhou, totaling 8,200 yuan. The money has been paid and receipts are held. Later, the plaintiff only received 400 pieces of pine planks, and the remaining 500 pieces of fir planks, worth 15,000 yuan at the current market price, were not received. The plaintiff later found out that the fir planks had been transported to Shanghai and pledged by the defendant to Ye Chuansheng. This batch of goods is still in the customs broker's office. Therefore, he is prosecuting based on Article 336, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, the defendant hired lawyers Wang Yaoting and Wu Zhiping to appear in court, arguing that the case was entirely a civil matter and that the plaintiff was acting out of spite to make the defendant subject to criminal punishment because the defendant had recently had a dispute with his wife in order to protect her mother. In March of this year, the defendant was entrusted by the plaintiff to handle one-inch and four-and-a-half-inch pine planks and box planks, and received 16,000 ocean dollars in Shanghai and another 7,000 yuan in Fuzhou. The goods have been prepared and are being loaded. Unexpectedly, because of a dispute between the defendant and his wife, the plaintiff automatically instructed Fuzhou to stop loading the goods and reported it to the police station. The goods that have arrived in Shanghai are another batch of seven-point fir planks, which were ordered by Yichengchang Timber Company. Now, Yichengchang Timber Company has also hired lawyer Zhao Chuanding to appear in court, which can prove this. Furthermore, the defendant was arrested once on April 30. At that time, the plaintiff forced the defendant to write a note. The defendant had no way to resist and had to obey. However, after being released, the defendant, out of anger, entrusted lawyer Wu Zhiping to publish a statement in the newspaper denying the validity of the note, stating that the two notes were not from the defendant's true intentions. As a result, the plaintiff reported the case to the police station again, and the defendant was detained for the second time. Now, he is requesting permission to post bail. The judge announced that the evidence submitted by the plaintiff was mostly inconsistent. The defendant was ordered to post bail of 15,000 yuan, and the hearing was rescheduled for the 15th.

### Ningbo Road Robbery - Origin of Handgun Ascertained - It Was a Chinese Constable in the French Concession Who Was Robbed - Investigation Underway to Determine if There Were Other Crimes

According to the Shanghai Times, at the west end of Ningbo Road and Henan Road on the afternoon of the 4th of this month, three armed bandits robbed Sheng Yinghua, an employee of Tianjin Hongji Cotton Cloth Company, of 4,000 yuan that he had just withdrawn from the bank, and shot and killed Sheng and Wang Shousen, the clerk of the Money Trade Association. The detectives arrived after hearing the alert. In desperation, one bandit abandoned his gun at No. 178 Tianjin Road, but broke into Lihua Silk Cloth Shop at No. 166, rushed to the bedroom on the second floor, changed clothes, and attempted to escape. He was captured on the spot by a Western detective, and the handgun was also seized. The Firearms Section of the Police Department has verified that the gun is a .32 caliber and was the gun that was robbed from a Chinese constable in the French Concession at the intersection of Avenue des Soeurs and Route Cardinal Mercier on the night of April 17. The Verification Section of the Public Concession Police Department is currently investigating whether the gun was used by bandits to commit other crimes between April 17 and the 4th of this month. The captured bandit is named Zhang Yaorong (transliteration), from Huzhou, 21 years old, and is said to reside at No. 1106 Huanlong Road. He is believed to be one of the three bandits who robbed the gun on April 17. The bandit is currently being treated at the police hospital because he was slightly injured in the lower part of his body by a shot fired by the deceased clerk during the robbery on the 4th of this month. As for the 4,000 yuan that was robbed, the police have recovered 1,375 yuan and are currently tracking down the other two bandits.

### Chinese Constable Abuses Authority - Relying on Strength to Ferociously Assault and Injure Someone - Official Orders to Request the Police Department to Investigate and Handle the Case

Mao Yunlong, the owner of Fuan Automobile Company at No. 60 Route Remi, French Concession, is 37 years old this year. Recently, he entrusted lawyer Tao Ran to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Chinese constable No. 1072 of the French Concession Police Station of abusing his authority and using an iron-core wooden stick to assault him, causing severe injuries, and requesting that the case be summoned for investigation and prosecution according to law, and reserving the right to file a civil suit for compensation. According to the complaint, at 10:00 PM on April 12, when Lou Zhigen, a truck driver, was adding oil to a truck in front of the company's door, the defendant, Chinese constable No. 1072, saw this and took the opportunity to pick a quarrel. The driver was having dinner, and the plaintiff heard the sound and came downstairs to explain in good faith that the truck could be driven away once the oil was added. Unexpectedly, the defendant became uncontrollably angry and struck the plaintiff on the head with the iron-core wooden stick he was carrying, causing a 　 hole and blood to gush out, and he fainted on the ground. The family telegraphed the Route Tenant de la Tour Police Station, which transferred him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The defendant used illegal and brutal actions to harm the victim's body. In addition to submitting a report to the Procuratorate of the Court on the 13th, he is filing a self-accusation according to law, requesting an investigation. The medical expenses incurred are considerable, and it is also worrying whether he will become disabled in the future. The plaintiff requests to reserve the right to file a civil lawsuit for medical expenses and other damages for the time being. After receiving the complaint, the court issued a summons for a hearing by Judge Huang Yan yesterday morning. The defendant did not appear. Only the plaintiff and his attorney were present to present the case. After verifying the evidence in court, the judge announced that the defendant had not arrived, the case was suspended, and the plaintiff was ordered to request the Police Department to investigate and handle the case.

### Financial News - Foreign Exchange and Hong Kong Dollars Supplied - HSBC's Listed Prices Rise - Chinese Merchants Also Come to Resell

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation saw HSBC's listed prices rising across the board. The exchange rate for British pounds was changed to three pence and one-eighth, and the exchange rate for U.S. dollars was changed to four and a half yuan. As for the domestic market situation, it was neither tight nor loose, and seemed to be entering a stable state. This was because the Hong Kong Telegraph's opening prices of three pence and fifteen sixty-two five per shilling and four yuan and fifty-six sixty-two five per U.S. dollar were maintained as much as possible, making it difficult for speculators to use their skills. Many of them sold into the market, causing the market to become quite rigid for a time. At one point, the hardest British pound was three pence and three seventy-five, and the U.S. dollar reached four yuan and eight seventy-five. However, because the Bank of England, HSBC, and stomach were very good, Chinese merchants and speculators also turned to plugging, causing a softening to appear. The afternoon was even stronger. In the early afternoon, the softening continued to the maintained supply price of Hong Kong. Speculators suddenly changed from plugging back to digging, and the foreign banks' limited appetite and heavy weighting reappeared, turning loose again. In the end, the spot and forward prices of British and American currencies tended to loosen, spot prices were particularly hard, and the swap spread opened up even more. It was heard that at noon, Chinese banks and a certain American bank were willing to sell spot and swap May contracts, posting a U.S. dollar spread of three corners and seventy-five points, with the interest rate reaching more than eight points. However, because cash was exhausted, it was difficult for arbitrageurs to be active.

The Situation Already Shows Loosening

At the beginning of the morning, the exchange rates of British pounds against U.S. dollars, Shanghai dollars, and French francs were all flat. The U.S. dollar fell three seventy-five against the British pound, five points against the Shanghai dollar, and half a point against the French franc. The central listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks' opening spot selling prices in the morning were three pence and fifteen sixty-two five per British pound and four yuan and fifty-six sixty-two five per U.S. dollar, which were harder by 〇thirty-one sixty-two five and looser by 〇sixty-two five, respectively, compared to the close last Saturday. The opening prices of the period were also slightly longer by 〇thirty-one sixty-two five and 〇sixty-two five. After the opening, the situation was stable. The Hong Kong Telegraph seemed to have the intention to maintain the opening price. It was estimated that Chinese merchants and speculators would sell May U.S. dollars to HSBC for four yuan and three seventy-five. HSBC's listed prices were announced, and they were all slightly longer. The exchange rate for British pounds was changed to three pence and one-eighth, and the exchange rate for U.S. dollars was listed at four and a half yuan. The announcement of the silver balance tax showed no increase or decrease. After this, speculators continued to come to plug and sell, and the market became looser. At that time, foreign firms absorbed spot U.S. dollars from speculators at four yuan and eighty-one sixty-two five, and it was heard that the hardest reached four yuan and eighty-seven sixty-two five. Soon after, because speculators suddenly turned to digging, there were more buyers. Fortunately, HSBC and others' supply intentions were not bad, but the price gradually turned softer. Speculators entered HSBC's May U.S. dollars, returning to four yuan and a half to three seventy-five. The momentum was still good until noon. As a result, the closing price was three pence and two eighty-one sixty-two five per British pound and four yuan and sixty-eight sixty-two five per U.S. dollar, with the May British pound at three pence and nine thirty-seven five and the U.S. dollar at four yuan and three seventy-five, both harder by 〇one twenty-five compared to the morning's opening spot prices.

Arbitrage Above Eight Points

The initial opening in the afternoon was tight again, with the British pound at three pence and two fifty and the U.S. dollar at four yuan and sixty-two fifty. However, because this price was close to Hong Kong Telegraph's maintained limit price of three pence and fifteen sixty-two five, speculators saw the scene and turned from buying to selling, and the softening trend was able to be contained. It was estimated that speculators sold May British pounds at three pence and ten ninety-three seventy-five and twelve twenty-five, and U.S. dollars in the same month at four yuan and forty-three seventy-five. After entering, the buyers' appetite was sluggish, and the closing price was still hard, with the British pound at two pence and two eighty-one sixty-two five and the U.S. dollar at four yuan and seventy-five, with the May British pound at three pence and nine thirty-seven five and the U.S. dollar at four yuan and forty-three seventy-five, both longer by one fifty-six twenty-five and looser by two fifty, respectively, compared to the closing spot prices last Saturday. The British and American currencies in this month are both 〇nine thirty-seven five and 〇one twenty-five.

### First Press, Then Lift: Extreme Anxiety in the Gold Market; Peak Reaches 7250 Yuan, Fluctuating 540 Yuan

Yesterday, the cash gold market was volatile, rising more than it fell, but people were uneasy and lacked firm buying and selling intentions. Therefore, it was expected that prices above 7,000 yuan might experience some consolidation. In the early morning, due to the sudden easing of the exchange rate, the price dropped from the opening of 6,800 yuan to 6,710 yuan. Gold shops were reportedly selling, but as the foreign exchange rate softened, the trend reversed. Banks and gold shops successively bought in, and by noon, the price had reached 6,970 yuan. Although a gold shop pushed down the price at the close of the morning session, news of favorable rumors concerning the European war spread, and gold shops aggressively raised prices, exceeding 7,000 yuan to reach 7,030 yuan. Later, as the foreign exchange market reported tighter conditions, the opening price was 7,100 yuan, and soon a new unprecedented peak of 7,250 yuan was reached. One gold shop took the lead in aggressively raising prices, but later a securities firm and another gold shop began selling, and the exchange rate slightly recovered, causing the price to gradually fall back to the 7,000 yuan level. The closing price was 7,010 yuan, 100 yuan higher than the previous weekend. The total trading volume for the day was over 4,000 taels. Silver jewelry prices fluctuated, ultimately increasing by 20 yuan. Customs gold prices remained unchanged.

Gold Bullion Still Up 100 Yuan

Since the morning, each tael (ten taels) initially reported a loose exchange market, and people's hearts were slightly frustrated. The market opened 110 yuan lower, with gold shops selling 20 taels to banks at 6,800 yuan. Subsequently, due to strong selling by gold shops, the price fell again by 90 yuan, reaching a low of 6,710 yuan. However, the trading volume was very small. The banks' buying gradually strengthened, and the market turned upward. Soon, the price returned to the 6,800 yuan level. Later, the foreign exchange market suddenly reported softening, boosting morale further, and securities firms rushed to buy, raising the price by several tens of yuan. Banks traded with each other at 6,900 yuan per tael. Afterwards, as speculators took the opportunity to sell, and buyers gradually decreased, the price fell back by 100 yuan. Speculators sold 30 taels to banks at 6,800 yuan. However, gold shops later bought in, and banks also competed to buy, and as the foreign exchange market continued to report tightening, the price jumped by 170 yuan. Gold shops bought several tens of taels from gold shops and banks, all at 6,970 yuan. Near the close, a gold shop disregarded the market price and pushed the price down by selling, closing at 6,965 yuan. After the close, another gold shop aggressively raised prices, reportedly due to favorable news from Europe, causing sellers to hesitate and raising the price to 7,030 yuan. The trading volume was extremely small. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange market reported tighter conditions, boosting morale further. The opening price jumped to 7,100 yuan, and then, with gold shops and retail investors rushing to buy, the price soared again by 150 yuan. Gold shops bought 30 taels from banks at an unprecedented high price of 7,250 yuan. Shortly after, the number of buyers decreased, and selling pressure intensified, gradually falling back to 7,200 yuan. The market became quiet for a time, with slight consolidation. Later, as the foreign exchange market hardened, selling increased, and gold shops and securities firms competed to sell, soon dropping by nearly 200 yuan. Gold shops sold 20 taels to securities firms at 7,000 yuan. At that time, speculators and scalpers frequently bought in, pushing the price up to 7,080 yuan. However, eventually, due to further selling by gold shops, and retail investors stopping buying, the price fell back by nearly 70 yuan. Securities firms sold 20 taels to gold shops, closing at 7,010 yuan. As a result, the price was 100 yuan higher than the previous Saturday, with a total fluctuation of 540 yuan throughout the day.

Silver Jewelry Up 20 Yuan

The initial price for silver jewelry sold by large silver shops was 700 yuan per tael. At 9:30 AM, the price increased by 10 yuan, at 11:30 AM it increased again by 10 yuan, at 12:00 PM it increased by another 10 yuan, at 12:10 PM it increased by another 10 yuan, and at 2:00 PM it increased again by 10 yuan.

New silver shops had the same price as before, and the purchase price decreased by about 30 yuan.

### Securities: Active Foreign Shares, Increased Trading

Yesterday's securities market was characterized by the fact that although the bulls were struggling, they were still unable to raise their heads. Rumors were rampant, changing rapidly, and people's hearts were shaken and restless. Cautious people mostly held back, and those forced by financial constraints mostly sold. There were few short covering, and even fewer bulls. The monthly interest rate on loans was as high as 40 to 50 percent, so the market price of government bonds was weak, and trading decreased significantly. In the morning, more Tungsun shares were sold, and more Lianhe and Tiansheng shares were also sold. Changji and Tung Yu bought slightly. In the afternoon, more Tungsih shares were sold, and Lianhe also continued to sell. Xinfu and Hongda bulls settled slightly, and Yuankang, Suifu, and retail investors bought. The market still turned from high to low. The result was mixed, with a difference of only 5 cents to 2.5 cents per share. The trading volume was only around 500,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below.

200 shares of Hanyeping shares were traded at a price of 4.25 yuan. The Shanghai Chinese General Chamber of Commerce stock market opened vigorously, and trading increased gradually. The price was much higher than the closing price on the previous Friday. There were no major disturbances that day, and the trend was firm, with no sign of turning back for a while.

British & Foreign shares once again occupied the top spot among industrial shares. 52,100 shares were traded, and the price also increased the most compared to the previous week's close. It once reached 75 yuan, and the closing price was 73 yuan with buyers. The other popular shares were International and Jardine Matheson, etc.

The trading volume of Yeguang shares was large, but the price change was very small. After seeing a high price of 17.4 yuan, it returned to 17.2 yuan at the close. The shares that were sold were the easiest to absorb.

From yesterday onwards, all prices of Wheelock Marden shares were marked with the words "ex-rights." The "new share rights" were traded separately. This complicated relationship initially caused hesitation among the general public, resulting in a long delay in trading. Operators needed to think carefully to determine the connection value between the two, so that they could compare them with the closing price of "speed rights" shares from the previous week. After a while, ex-rights shares were traded at 130 yuan, and new share rights were traded at 100 yuan. At the close, the former was 131 yuan and the latter was 98 yuan. Purchasers of new share rights had to pay 25 yuan per share to the company, so the total capital of each new share was 123 yuan. However, the interest on this new share would be calculated from April 1st onwards, and the company's operating profit before that would not be included. Although the exact amount of the old share is unknown, it is believed that there is still a final dividend to be paid. Purchasers should not ignore this, and the difference between the two share prices can be regarded as the market's imagined final dividend of the old share.

Rubber shares were in great demand, and the trend of each share was very active. However, the prices of each share did not rise in the same proportion. The following several types were particularly obvious.

British & Foreign Java closed at 56 yuan the previous day and 60 yuan yesterday. British & Foreign Kotah closed at 29 yuan the previous day and 31.5 yuan yesterday. Langkat closed at 39 yuan the previous day and 47 yuan yesterday. Rubber Trust closed at 37.25 yuan the previous day and 39.25 yuan yesterday. All the above rubber companies are located in the Dutch East Indies, so the only reason they are popular is undoubtedly that these companies are not subject to the foreign exchange restriction regulations, unlike many other British Malayan companies.

### Grains: Exchange Rate Slightly Eases, Foreign Rice Dumped, Demand Surges

The rice market, due to the unexpected surge in gold prices, initially seemed difficult to contain. However, the market is volatile, and as the gold market and exchange rate stabilized, a downward trend was seen. The initial opening in the morning saw limited activity, and the market was relatively stable. Then, news spread of falling gold prices and a looser exchange rate, causing changes to occur. Calls for sales spread throughout the market, with tight capital and everyone rushing to dump their holdings, resulting in chaos and a loss of market benchmarks. Price declines were inconsistent. Siaochiao rose three levels, while Saigon depreciated nine yards. This is because Siaochiao has recently been entirely controlled by speculation and is most active. Although there are fluctuations, it is mainly a rise with small declines. Yesterday, the lowest price was still 48.8 yuan, and by the close, it still reached 49.5 yuan, only depreciating by half a yuan compared to the previous week's closing price of 50 yuan. The situation for other goods was completely different, with actual sales being slow and fathers being neglected by the mind, leading to a small movement of inventory, deviating from the norm, and falling by two or three yuan. In the past, Niangti rice was priced three or four yuan, or one or two yuan higher than Siaochiao, but now its sales price is almost equal to Siaochiao. The closing price for Saigon No. 1 was only 50 yuan, Saigon No. 2 was around 49 yuan, Siam and fire milled rice were 49.5 yuan, and Siam No. 2 was even cheaper, shorter than Siaochiao by more than one yuan, opening at only 48.3-48.4 yuan. This kind of abnormal development is truly the result of the speculation transaction, which has been rarely seen in the past. Fortunately, the market for broken rice and rice bran was not large, so it was able to maintain its own identity without much fluctuation. High quality rice still sold for 45.5 to 45 yuan, and special broken rice ranged from 43.2 to 40 yuan.

The source of japonica rice from the mainland has become increasingly scarce due to transportation issues. Although the demand from the sales market seems to be strong, it is also constrained by foreign rice and is falling by about one yuan. Special grade Wuxi japonica rice is 51-52 yuan, powdered japonica rice is 50 yuan, Changkun japonica rice is 51-50 yuan, Zhongsu japonica rice is 47-48 yuan, and Qing Si special grade thin rice is 50-48.5 yuan. Nangang early rice rose from 49.5 yuan to 48 yuan.

Glutinous rice was originally slow to move, but it is now even more weak and lacking in spirit. Therefore, Jinli rice, originally 43.5-43 yuan, has been lowered to 41-42 yuan, while the worst quality sold for 39.5 yuan, which is more than one yuan lower than the previous trading session.

Yesterday, the foreign rice market had leveled off, as the previous days' soaring prices were entirely created by speculators. In reality, official transactions were observing. Yesterday's market transactions were still driven by speculation, so the market price rose and fell rapidly, changing in an instant. However, with the exchange rate loosening, the price of rice slightly recovered a few cents. Currently, Siaochiao rice is the most popular, with fluctuating prices. The opening price in the morning was 50.3 yuan, rising to 50.5 yuan, and then immediately falling to 48.7 yuan. After rising once in the afternoon, the final price was 49.4 yuan, with no buyers. The prices of other types of rice all showed fluctuations. The returned Saigon No. 2 opened at 59 yuan and closed at 59.7 yuan in the afternoon. The weakness of Xing rice has reached 58.35-58.4 yuan per original package with small grain. The total volume of spot rice traded was 8-9 thousand bags, and the returned original packages totaled more than 600 tons.

Also, foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday, totaling 5,172 bags, shipped from Hong Kong by Jardine Matheson's Yüsheng vessel.

### Flour Market Firm, -- Wheat Still Holding Strong --

Yesterday, the plate price of the No. 2 Flour Mill remained at 14 yuan. All mills had already raised prices twice in the previous week, and would not raise them further. However, there was a shortage of returned goods, and holders still regarded them as rare commodities, unwilling to release them easily, bidding three or four cents higher than the mill's price. There was no formal agreement on the unified market transaction. In addition to the 5-6 thousand bags directly approved by the mill, only the inland flour had some transactions. It is said that it is more convenient to report inland flour to Shanghai, so the sales to local customers are also more active. The Shunfeng brand produced by the Wuxi mill opened at 14.3 yuan, and later 2-3 thousand bags were traded at 14.25-14.2 yuan. The market is gradually becoming firm.

In addition, a large batch of flour is being shipped north. Today, Jardine Matheson's Chongqing shipped 10,000 bags of flour from Shanghai to Yantai and 6,500 bags to Qingdao. It is said that they are all mill goods, and there are also 3,000 bags of foreign corn shipped to Yantai.

The buying and selling of wheat yesterday was still holding strong, and the market had not much change.

### Yarn and Cotton: Actual Sales Slow, Yarn Market Returns to Looseness, Double Horse Falls 30 Yuan

The yarn market had been soaring for days, but yesterday, the foreign exchange rate turned to ease, and people's minds stabilized. The market returned to looseness. However, due to the ongoing European war and the tense situation in the Mediterranean, some people did not give up their bullish outlook, but actual sales were very sluggish.

In the morning, the spot yarn market opened with weakness in the US exchange rate and a lack of buyers in the market, and the market turned to decline. The futures price for 20-count Double Horse was 1740 yuan, and immediately rose to 1770 yuan. The spot price for Double Horse was 1720 yuan. Upon hearing that the price of gold had fallen, actual sales were sluggish, and the price fell again to 1660 yuan. The closing price recovered slightly. It was found that the total transaction volume in the morning was 1,595 packages. The market price for 10-count Double Horse fell 30 yuan. The amounts purchased by each group are listed below.

Trade: 1,100 Hong Kong: 485

Mainland: 10 Total: 1,599

### After Exchange Tightens, Some Cotton Merchants Stop Loading Fixed Loans

The transaction of local cotton is not active, but the trend is very tight. This is because the inventory is dwindling, and people's hearts are firm and bullish, so the selling price is advancing slowly. The details of the spot cotton transactions are listed below.

Huocao: 244.00: Trade in 1,135 bales

Also: 247.00: Also 300 bales

Durilla: 293.00: Also 200 pieces

Pingguoer: 228.00: Also 100 pieces

Mitelin: 330.00: Also 100 pieces

Langgong: 292.00: Also 100 pieces

Kangjiang: 290.00: Also 100 pieces

Also, the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market, was relatively quiet. A portion of overseas cotton merchants and short covering resulted in the closing price falling one to two pounds for the near term and rising three to five pounds for the long term. The Indian cotton market fell more than two rupees yesterday along with the forecast. The Egyptian market was closed.

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai was relatively quiet due to the extreme tightness of money. However, because there was very little spot on the market, the selling price was still firm and bullish. But calculated according to the current exchange rate, it is still cheap by more than 15%. Due to the tightening of the exchange rate, some traders stopped loading from overseas or slightly covered the losses and bought back from foreign firms, totaling about a thousand bales. According to general opinion, regardless of whether the exchange rate tightens or loosens in the future, the selling price of cotton will rise steadily. The factory price converted at the US exchange rate of 4.5 yuan yesterday is as follows.

20 count: US Mitelin: 87.95

20 count: Also: lower grade 372.80

32 count: Also: 403.60

32 count: Also: lower grade 390.00

42 count: Also: 418.30

42 count: Also: lower grade 406.50

1050 pieces of Indian cotton, loaded on the British company's Hilula, arrived in Shanghai from Mumbai and berthed at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong the day before yesterday to unload.

### Piece Goods: Speculation Active, Market Price Rises Again in the Afternoon

Domestic Cloth: Yesterday, the actual transaction of the cloth market was still undeveloped, and speculators were very busy. The market price fluctuated frequently with the rise and fall of the price of gold. The opening price of each commodity was stable in the morning, and the market trend was relatively firm in the afternoon. As a result, white goods, coarse cloth, and coarse twill rose by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece. The factory price for autumn blue cloth was very high, while the price of light-colored goods was unable to rise due to seasonal reasons. More than 700 pieces were traded in the street. Guangdong and Fujian traders entered more than 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill, and the Zhejiang and Jiangxi traders also processed more than 100 pieces. It was found that there were 37 pieces of piece goods shipped to Hong Kong today.

Dongbu: The market atmosphere was very sharp in the morning. Longtou fine cloth was 55.25 yuan, but due to the lack of actual sales, it immediately fell. The lowest price was 52.25 yuan. Later, as the price of gold continued to rise, the industry's intention to enter the market improved, and the price gradually recovered. Therefore, the closing price of Longtou fine cloth was 54.25 yuan, 56.5 yuan this month, and Drill current sales increased to 1.5425 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Bean Cakes Sell Well, Soybeans Rise Again

Yesterday, the soybean market, although the oil market was weak, the sales of bean cakes were active (the price rose sharply by 30-40 cents. 20,000 pieces were processed and went to Shantou, Quanzhou, Fuhua, etc.) Therefore, the foundation was consolidated and the market price continued to rise by 40-50 cents. The Nanyang help oil factories and Hong Kong, etc., traded more than 650 bags of Anqing soybeans, more than 670 bags of Wuhu soybeans, two carts of Nanjing soybeans, 140 bags of Taicang soybeans, one cart of Yangzhou Shanhuang soybeans, two carts of Bengbu soybeans, more than 400 bags of Dingjiazhou soybeans, 140 bags of Zhangyan Du soybeans, and 70 bags of Dalian Jiaqing soybeans. The prices are detailed in the market price column. 3,100 bags of soybeans and 1,800 tons of bean cakes were shipped to Hong Kong on the 7th.

### Sugar Market: Zhang Diaoqing Must Be Applied for at 70 Yuan

According to the Dutch telegram yesterday, the price of coarse sand was slightly lower by one point and two and a half points. C.I.F.&.K.G. was 8.425 in Dutch currency. The club plate in this city was loosened by two or three corners, the current price of 24 rough white in this warehouse was seventy-six yuan four corners to seven yuan, and the new arrivals in other warehouses were seventy-six yuan three corners. The afternoon transaction was more vigorous, so it rose to seventy-seven yuan and two corners, the old goods were seventy-six yuan, and seventy-six yuan and a half in the afternoon, re-export sixty yuan, Taikoo car white continued to be tight, B mark west warehouse eighty-seven yuan, calculated to rise seven corners, HY K eighty-five yuan and a half, H mark red new goods sixty-three yuan, old goods sixty-two yuan and a half, Dutch old sixty-seven yuan, calculated to rise one yuan, re-export fifty-five yuan and a half, local factory snow white seventy-six yuan and a half, local ice ninety yuan and a half, Jingming ice ninety-two yuan, national sugar Zhang Diaoqing according to the production report in the past week, the price per dan in Zhangzhou has risen by more than twenty yuan, the price per dan in Xiamen has risen by more than ten yuan, there is still a shortage of goods, so the application must be seventy yuan. Five hundred bags of sugar will be shipped to Tianjin today (7th).

### Hardware: Tianjin and Qingdao Traders Purchase Slightly

Yesterday, hardware prices stabilized due to the stable foreign exchange rate, and the upward trend leveled off. The actual sales of the industry were still light. Only Tianjin and Qingdao traders made some purchases, and the local can factories, toy factories, printing factories, and thermos factories were slightly active. The city had nearly a thousand loads of transactions. Those who handled it included flat white iron, native factory nails, bamboo steel bars, black iron billets, 26-gauge large tinplate, 90-pound and 100-pound small tinplate, new plate yuan, square light strips, white iron plate white lead wire, new lead wire, foreign yuan head, and 180-pound double-linked Italian tinplate.

### Tumultuous Controversy in the American Education Community: Dr. Russell Ruled by the Court Not to Teach at New York College

The renowned British philosopher and mathematician Dr. Russell, formerly a British Earl, abandoned his noble status, preferring to live as a commoner. He is currently a philosophy professor at the University of California. On February 26th of this year, the City College of New York hired him to be a philosophy professor from February next year, with an annual remuneration of $8,000. A Mrs. Kai, whose two children have reached school age, petitioned the New York City Board of Higher Education on March 19th in her capacity as a taxpayer. She argued that Russell advocated "immoral and obscene free love doctrines" as a reason to terminate his employment. On March 30th, Justice McCook of the New York State Supreme Court ruled that hiring Russell as a professor at the City College was not only "a stain on academic integrity" but also "an insult to the residents of New York City," and ordered the City Board of Higher Education to terminate Russell's employment.

The judgment document is seventeen pages long and states that according to the New York State Education Law, Russell, not having obtained American citizenship, cannot teach in the state. The New York City Board of Higher Education's approval of Russell's employment without examination procedures also violated the New York State Constitution. "Most unconscionable" was that such employment would "endanger the public health, safety, and morals of the people."

After the verdict was announced, Mrs. Kai called it "a victory for every parent in New York City and a victory for justice and purity." Professor Russell, from the University of California in Los Angeles, cabled that "he did not want to comment at this stage and was seeking legal advice." It is also unknown whether the Board of Higher Education will appeal. The American Civil Liberties Union has cabled Russell, expressing its willingness to provide support. Bishop Manning, who first attacked Russell in an open letter to the newspaper on March 1st, "does not want to comment at this time."

Dr. Hotchkiss, Vice President of the University of California, said that the school had no criticism of Russell's scholarship and teaching methods. His decision to leave the school this spring was entirely voluntary. Payne, editor of the California student publication, expressed his opinion, saying, "This matter is a tragedy for American education. The New York State Court's ruling that Russell is not qualified to teach in the state is nonsensical. No professor I have studied with surpasses Russell. His students must be outraged by this verdict. If the University of California can find a way to retain Russell, the entire faculty and student body would welcome it. I took two courses taught by Russell and never heard him mention any moral issues."

Russell's third wife, Patricia, said, "We are guests in a foreign land and do not know the legal procedures. How to proceed will be handled by lawyers in New York. Although we do not want to cause trouble, we have no choice. The crux of this case is an issue of civil rights and academic freedom, concerning countless intellectuals. We cannot remain silent at this point." Russell's students are petitioning the University of California authorities to retain him, and many of his colleagues have also risen to defend him. Dr. Reichenbach, a philosophy professor at California, said, "We all know that Professor Russell is a great philosopher of our time. This verdict by the New York court is outrageous." Russell's student, Betty, said, "It is a rare privilege to hear Dr. Russell lecture. He is indeed a noble scholar, and my morals have never been corrupted by him."

When Justice McCook distributed the judgment to reporters, he said that he had studied Russell's works late into the night before making this judgment. The first six pages of the judgment explained the issues of citizenship and examination, while the remaining eleven pages denounced Russell's views on sexual behavior, citing the theories in four of Russell's books as the basis. The judgment concluded, "Teachers have more power to influence students' thoughts than various terms. Assuming Russell were allowed to teach at the City College for two years without promoting his views, it would still violate the academic regulations mentioned above. Russell's philosophy and behavior directly contradict New York State criminal law. Academic freedom, a right, should never be used as a pretext to mislead young people and violate criminal law." (Translated from the March 31st New York Herald Tribune)

### Harvard University Declares Russell's Appointment Still Valid

The New York Times reported that Harvard University officials stated that the university had already hired Professor Russell as a lecturer in philosophy and semantic evolution for half a semester. Although the New York Supreme Court has ruled that Russell is not allowed to teach at the City College of New York, Harvard University's appointment is not affected. The university has always advocated that all teachers should enjoy "academic freedom." According to reports, when Harvard University announced the appointment of Russell as a lecturer two years ago, Massachusetts State Representative Dooling also protested, citing the same reasons as those listed in New York. Before the New York City Board of Higher Education's decision, there was a great dispute in the church and education communities regarding the issue of hiring Russell. Therefore, a special meeting was held to discuss it, and by a vote of eleven to seven, the motion to reconsider Russell's employment was defeated. Russell is 67 years old and has been divorced twice. He is now married for the third time.

### Spring Welcoming Ceremony

Although welcoming spring is an ancient custom, the ceremonial arrangements are the same everywhere. This year's spring welcoming ceremony in Hangzhou is more elaborate than in previous years, also a sign of peace and prosperity. On the 13th day of the first month, the weather was clear and fine. Spectators filled the area from Qingchun Gate to the intersection of Puan Street, as well as Henghe Bridge and Shipailou, a distance of three or four li, with hardly any space to stand. On that day, the three prefectural officials and the officials of the two counties under its jurisdiction, all dressed in their official robes and hats, arranged a full set of ceremonial items. They went to the Governor's office to offer spring greetings, then took warm sedan chairs out of Qingchun Gate to Shangxin Temple. First, they performed the spring plowing ceremony, then respectfully welcomed the God of Spring into the city. The officials then changed to ornate sedan chairs and returned to their offices. The God of Spring was then paraded around to the various government offices. The next day, he was taken to the Wushan Tai Sui Temple to be enshrined, restoring him to his former position. When welcoming the spring, around noon, the sound of gongs and drums vibrated, and the sound of Sheng and Guan harmonized. First, there were several decorated pavilions, each with vases and other items. Next, there were dozens of pairs of gold-lettered plaques, all with phrases such as "Good weather for the crops," "Five grains abundant," and so on. Then there were four raised platforms, each with two people dressed as the Eight Immortals. Following them was a paper ox, carried on poles, with the same colors as depicted in the Spring Ox Diagram. Behind it was a person leading a live ox slowly, as it was the ox that the Tai Sui would plow with. People seeing it would scramble to pull out its hair, believing it would bring good luck. In the afternoon, there was usually a spring official, who often mingled in the crowd, making it impossible to identify him. This was because the people of Hangzhou would scramble to beat the spring official, calling it "Beating the Spring." The ceremony will be continued tomorrow.

### Being a World Citizen (3)

What should we do? Science is valuable and must be preserved. So, let's eliminate narrow-mindedness. But how do we eliminate it? Honestly, we all have this narrow-minded tendency. We are narrow, selfish, and cruel, but to varying degrees. Are we going to eliminate humanity to eradicate it? That won't work. We have to settle for the next best thing: transforming narrow-minded people into broad-minded people, short people into giants, and narrow-minded people into godly beings. Therefore, people today need the following three things: (1) A world-mindedness: A person's mind should be broad, not just deep. Narrow-minded people have narrow minds, while godly people have broad minds. If you want to know how broad-minded someone is, just look at what they pray for. For example, if someone only prays four times for us and then stops, you know how narrow-minded they are. Most people pray like this: "God, watch over my child at school, Jane in the office, Mom in the kitchen, and Dad in the factory, Amen." But don't they know that there are more people than just these who need our prayers? That's why Jesus taught us to pray, "Our Father," "Our daily bread," "Our sins." The word "our" includes everyone. A new magazine in the United States called "World Affairs" discusses all issues from a global perspective. If we read this magazine, our minds will become world-minded. When we pray, we won't limit ourselves to our own families. We'll include black, white, red, yellow, and people of all colors in our prayers. This is one of the greatest needs. (2) A world-conscience: Everyone has a conscience. However, some people have narrow consciences. They have a conscience in certain places or about certain things, but not in others. For example, someone may not want to steal from their mother, but they will take the opportunity to rob their neighbors. Such a conscience is a threat to social security.

### On the Physique of the Chinese Nation from an Anthropological Perspective

— Nan Jun

In this day of bloody strife, the law of the jungle seems to have become the common rule of evolution. The fact that our great Chinese nation is being trampled upon by others is undeniable. The external pressure and urgency of national subjugation and racial extinction are recognized by everyone as having reached the most critical point. We must grit our teeth, exert our greatest strength in resistance, and embark on a bright path to seek human freedom and equality. However, some patriots often think of the question of racial inferiority, that is, "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Chinese nation?" Indeed, the rise and fall of a nation and the prosperity and decline of a race involve various complex factors. But from the perspective of the nation itself, it occupies an important position among these factors. We will temporarily set aside the facts of spiritual culture and, from an anthropological viewpoint, analyze the physique of the nation to understand our own physical condition in the world. This is also a meaningful thing.

Based on known materials, the physique of the Chinese nation can be analyzed according to the criteria of human classification to obtain the following results. These contributions from anthropologists are indeed common knowledge that ordinary people should know to understand themselves. For the sake of clarity, they are described as follows:

Height: The height of Chinese people varies from north to south. The average height of people in Hebei is 1690 mm, while the average height of people in Guangdong is 1618 mm, a difference of 72 mm. The other provinces are in between these two extremes. From this, it can be seen that the height of Chinese people can be classified into three categories: tallest, tall, and medium. At the same time, it can be said that the height of Chinese people is directly proportional to geographical latitude. Compared with the world's population, we are in the "medium" category.

Head Shape: Head shape is the most important standard for human classification, generally divided into three types, according to the cephalic index. Long-headed people account for 14.41% of Chinese people, medium-headed people account for 42.14%, and broad-headed people account for 43.47%. In terms of geographical distribution, long-headed people are more common in the north, called the Yellow River type; medium-headed people are more common in the central region, called the Yangtze River type; and broad-headed people are more common in the south, called the Pearl River type. The size of the head shape is closely related to brain capacity. From an evolutionary perspective, the degree of evolution of broad-headed and medium-headed people is higher.

Hair: The hair of Chinese people is a coarse, long, straight hair, rarely curly or wavy. The cross-section under a microscope is round or nearly round, and usually black. According to anatomical studies, wavy hair is closest to apes, followed by straight hair, and woolly hair is the highest. From the perspective of human evolutionary history, because our body hair is sparse, we seem to be far above Caucasians. Furthermore, according to the law of heredity, black hair is superior in color. Therefore, our hair is indeed in the highest position in the evolution of the world's population.

Skin Color: The superiority of skin color in the evolutionary process does not involve aesthetic considerations. From the facts of disease resistance, it is known that black skin is the strongest, followed by yellow skin, and white skin is the weakest. Yellow people are easily adaptable to both cold and hot zones, so Chinese people can live no matter where they emigrate, and rarely suffer from illness due to acclimatization. This advantage is a natural characteristic of yellow skin.

Lips: The thickness of the lips is also an important piece of evidence in human evolution. According to animal morphology, the lips of Caucasians are the thinnest, which seems to be closer to apes, followed by yellow people, and black people are indeed the most "humanized".

Facial Angle: A straight line from the forehead to the tip of the nose, and another line from the nose to the ear, the angle formed by the intersection of the two lines is called the facial angle. According to the inference of evolutionary theory, the greater the facial verticality, that is, the smaller the facial angle, the lower his intelligence; conversely, it is higher. The facial angle of Chinese people is between that of black and white people. If intelligence is indeed closely related to the size of the facial angle, then their natural intelligence belongs to the middle level, not inferior.

Eyes: The eye color of Chinese people is usually dark brown, not black. The degree of opening is medium, and there is often a layer called the "Mongolian fold" at the inner corner near the nose, but its function is unknown. The shape of the eyes is slightly slanted, called almond eyes, that is, the outer corner is slightly higher than the inner corner.

Nose: In the evolutionary process, the nose shape of Caucasians is high and narrow, occupying the most superior position. Most Chinese people have medium noses, and the form of broad noses is especially prominent in southern people, perhaps due to climate reasons. In this respect, Chinese people seem to be lower.

The above-mentioned points are the criteria used in racial taxonomy. Upon close examination, it is known that the physical structure of Chinese people is not in an inferior position. Compared with other races in the world, it shows many advantages, and shows the fact of "medium" everywhere. Thinking from the standpoint of biological evolution, "medium" may be the result of eliminating inferiority and retaining superiority. With this kind of scientific analysis, it can greatly break our self-doubting concepts. From this, it can be seen that today's being invaded by others is definitely not based on the problem of racial inferiority. Of course, there are other complex factors, such as social organization, political system, popular knowledge, and patriotic thought, which are very important factors.

We don't need to despise each other, and we should unite the entire nation as one. "Know yourself first, and then proceed with your work" is a commendable motto. Indeed, ancient nations inevitably decline, but new stimuli, pressures, and trampling may also be the greatest driving force for regeneration. A glorious future will be opened up from this.

### The Entertainment of Heads of State

— Song Jinglian

According to recent news from Cairo, the capital of Egypt, the eighteen-year-old King Farouk of Egypt is preparing to take a pilot test in order to obtain a pilot's license. In fact, this news is not surprising to those who know the king, because King Farouk is exceptionally healthy and is already very fond of various outdoor sports.

Since the tragedies of King Albert of Belgium falling to his death while mountaineering in 1934 and the Queen of Belgium dying in a car accident in 1935, heads of state around the world still take dangerous sports (such as flying and driving) as their leisure activities, just as King Farouk of Egypt is dedicated to driving airplanes.

However, the life of a head of state is very important, so the British House of Commons has intervened in this matter. The House of Commons requested King George V to order the then heir to the throne, the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII, now the Duke of Windsor), not to ride horses excessively. George V himself was also very fond of horseback riding. He would ride a horse to Hyde Park every day and was also good at yachting and a skilled helmsman. The boldest was former King Alfonso XIII of Spain. He was a good horse rider and car driver. When he was traveling in Bordeaux, France, he was stopped by a traffic police officer for speeding.

King Carol of Romania now only plays with his son by riding horses and skating. Before he ascended the throne, he loved flying and took an airplane to regain the throne.

King Boris of Bulgaria likes to drive cars and trucks at high speed on the rugged roads of Bulgaria. He also likes to drive trains and has obtained a license from Bulgarian railway technicians and is honored to be elected as the honorary president of the Railway Workers' Union.

As for the entertainment of the Emperor of Sweden, I think everyone knows that he is a tennis master.

Prince Olav of Norway likes to ride motorcycles.

The elderly King Christian of Denmark likes to travel by bicycle.

Hitler does not like outdoor sports. As for his brother in difficulty, Mussolini, it is the opposite. Whether it is airplanes, cars, motorcycles, horseback riding, swimming, race walking... he has a share in everything. Mussolini is indeed versatile and can also speak several languages!

French President Lebrun likes to ride horses and stroll in the Rambouillet forest.

The entertainment of the following heads of state is very different from the above, and is in the field of art: King Carlos I of Portugal, who was assassinated in 1908, was a famous painter and won gold medals twice at the French Salon exhibition and the Paris Exposition in 1900.

Queen Mother Elizabeth of Romania, who came from the British royal family, is a prolific writer. In history, Queen Victoria was good at painting, especially depicting rural scenery, and always had a small sketchbook in her luggage. The unparalleled beauty Queen Marie Antoinette liked to carve scenes of Paris on buttons. Napoleon III's mother was good at watercolor painting and portraiture.

Now let's talk about Hitler. Although he is not good at sports, he is a painter. A few years ago, the editor-in-chief of the Berliner Morgenpost published a collection of watercolors, which included the works of a corporal during the European War, signed Adolf Hitler.

### Do Not Abuse Your Spirit

— Chen Shichao

I often see many patients who become weak due to overwork, and then catch a cold and are bedridden. Those who are stubborn insist on persevering, but greater hidden damage breaks out, forcing them to fall into bed. The period for seeing a doctor is one week for the former, and even two or three years for the latter. The medical expenses are of course considerable, and the loss of business for a week or two or three years is even greater. The working time in a day is eight hours. When you work for ten hours and think you are diligent enough, you don't know that you have lost a portion of your spirit that must be preserved. After a month or two, you will gradually feel unsustainable. If you continue to do this, you will need to rest for a longer period. Then, your business will stop, your savings will be depleted, and time will slowly pass.

If you have to work so hard because of the heavy burden of life, please pay attention to the following points: go to bed early, sleep more, be silent, worry less, and avoid wild thoughts. As for playing cards, making trouble, and drinking excessive alcohol, these are not games that benefit the body and mind. Normal entertainment, such as music and walking, are free and may be increased appropriately.

### Film Workers' Guide: The Functions and Responsibilities of Cinematography

— De

There are good film criticisms in the newspapers, but there are also bad ones. He would blame the actors for the director's mistakes; he would attribute the director's strengths to the cinematographer. Here I briefly explain the six major functions and responsibilities of film art, hoping that the general audience and film critics will use a more advanced perspective to examine the merits and demerits of a film:

Screenwriter

His responsibility is to make the theme of a movie upright, the content rich, and in line with the times. He must avoid unclear themes, empty content, banality, absurdity, nonsense, no social significance, and no artistic value, etc.

Director

He wants to use film techniques to concretely put the script handed down by the screenwriter on the screen. He has to manage the rhythm of the whole play. Where can he be understated? Where should important arrangements be made? How to grasp the key moment of the play? How to prevent the audience's mood from relaxing? He also has to clearly distinguish the personalities of each character in the play, and do not make an actor suddenly reveal different personalities in the same play. He should mobilize other collaborators, such as musicians, sound engineers, and cinematographers, to help the progress of his play, and how to control his actors from acting like a civilized drama.

Actor

Whether he personally does well, does well. He should carefully study the role he plays. Personality, action, tone, attitude, demeanor, how a certain scene should be expressed, and how a certain scene should reveal his true feelings. If he is underdone or overdone, and his movements and attitudes are not enough of an artist's status, then it is his mistake.

Set Designer

He should arrange to create a "environment" suitable for the plot, and whether the atmosphere of the scene is sufficient is also worth investigating.

Cinematographer

Lighting is his important mission. The light money for each scene should be completely unified. Strong scenes should use hard lines and lighting. Beautiful and lyrical scenes should use soft and light tones. Happy scenes should use bright tones, and so on.

Sound Engineer

His responsibility is to adjust the language and sound. The pitch and intensity of the sound should be suitable for the development of the plot. However, the crudeness of the machinery and other insufficient material conditions are not his fault.

The reporter of this newspaper said the following words at the end of his communication: "The citizens of Chongqing and several other larger cities in inland China, such as Chengdu, are the same. They now crave high-end music as much as other living conditions, so they are very welcome to singing groups from various places to come and perform."

### After Watching Selling Unicorn (Part 2)

— Wei Wo

Because in that play, the faces of "poverty and wealth", "snobbery", "good and evil", "cause and effect", "natural disasters" and "man-made disasters" are thoroughly revealed. Especially the fact that the rich man with ten thousand guans of wealth may immediately become a poor man, as well as the two points of doing good and getting blessings and knowing how to repay kindness, can be said to contain sufficient stimulation in today's world.

The playwright has put a lot of thought into the arrangement, and many humorous dialogues are really to the point, making people laugh and cry. In this satisfactory arrangement, there are many new contributions. Several scenes completely borrow car dialogues and are absolutely dramatized. For example, when there is a flood, the water god is not used to pass the scene, but the crowd shouts "The flood is coming" behind the curtain, which is also a reform worthy of praise. The several plays recently written by Yanqiu do have small reforms that make people's ears and eyes refreshed, and this play is even more progressive.

Speaking of technology, Yanqiu's work has always been admired, especially in acting sad plays. Xue Xiangling in the first part is a daughter of a thousand gold, and Yanqiu still has an extraordinary performance, depicting Xiangling's pampered and extravagant beauty, with graceful and dignified manners. When watching the dowry, the water sleeves have two wonderful postures. Speaking of singing, this play can be said to let the audience enjoy the drama to the fullest. The most important are two segments of erliu, one segment of erhuang, and one segment of xipi. The first segment of erliu is the scene of sheltering from the rain in the Spring and Autumn Pavilion. After this segment of erliu, it turns into a allegro. There is a good tune in the fourth sentence of the blank mouth "Presumably it is a newlywed couple crossing the Magpie Bridge", and there is a good tune in the three words "Crossing the Magpie Bridge". It turns to Allegro later, and there are even better tunes, especially the last sentence of each paragraph, and the closing tune is never the same, which is not easy. Among the lyrics, there are sentences with seven characters and sentences with six characters, which are even more novel. When Ban Tianlin travels to Aunt's place, he sings erhuang slow board, and finally sings a large section of erliu with a crying head. There are many new tunes in total, but due to space limitations, it is not convenient to list them one by one. In short, Yanqiu's tune is not easy to learn in the first place, and the tune used in this play makes people feel that "it sounds good to listen to, but it is difficult to learn." As for the supporting roles, the distribution seems to be slightly inappropriate. Furongcao should play Zhao Shuzhen, and Zhang Chunyan should play Lu Han. It is said that this play by Yanqiu is still being rehearsed for the first time, and for the convenience of future performances, Wu Fuqin is assigned to play Zhao Shuzhen, then the role of Meixiang is quite important. Why not assign Cao Ergeng, but assign Liu Binkun. The performance results show that Liu Binkun's Meixiang is the best. Binkun plays an ugly girl, which is rarely seen, and playing Meixiang in this play is just right. In the same scene as Yanqiu, he has the beauty of setting off the most, and Binkun can not make the audience laugh with his big voice and strange strength. He completely wins with his acting skills and small movements, which is worth applauding. Furongcao's Gu Yunsu's play is not much, and there is no room for his talents. Cao Ergeng's ugly girl and Li Xiaolong's Hu Jie are extremely funny. Wu Fuqin's Zhao Shuzhen and Zhang Chunyan's Xue Liang are both competent. Sun Futing, Li Siguan, Cishaoquan are mediocre. There are many actors in this play, and the entire Huangquan troupe is almost completely dispatched. Judging from the performance results, this play is still worth watching.

### The Recording of a Choir's Performance in Chongqing

— Xin Fang

In the past month, a newspaper in Boston, USA, published a Chongqing communication. The content described the recent performance of a choir jointly composed of Chinese and Western followers of Jesus in the local area. Now the original text is excerpted and translated as follows:

The leader of the group is a Canadian named Gada Anniu. There are a total of 58 members, including foreign missionaries and students from the five major universities in Chengdu. A total of three performances were given in Chongqing, and the venue was借借國泰大戲院 (illegible characters). The state of crowding was unbelievable at each performance. As for the songs sung, they can be divided into two types; one is simply irrelevant to the War of Resistance, and the other is absolutely capable of influencing the War of Resistance. The former includes famous songs such as "The Night of the Danube", and the latter includes "Resistance Song" "Song of Resisteuce" compiled by Huang Jun, etc. In addition, a Buddhist hymn was also sung; it is really a strange thing in the world for a choir composed of Jesus's followers to sing a Buddhist hymn. The group has identified 7,000 yuan of the performance income to donate to Chinese war orphans.

Speaking of the activities of the group besides the three performances on stage, it was to accept the welcoming parties from various local parties; and broadcast several times. When Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi often arrived in Chongqing, he specially set up a banquet to wash away the dust.

### Jin Suqin and Hua Huilin — Will Perform in Hong Kong

— Sea

Since Jin Suqin's performance at the Lee Theatre did not materialize, she has been enjoying a leisurely life there. She is not preparing to return to Shanghai for the time being. Recently, she asked a friend who came to Shanghai from Hong Kong to get the script and head ornaments of "The Hatred of Life and Death" from her younger sister Suwen, as if she is about to be active again.

The reporter recently received a letter from a friend in Hong Kong, saying that Rui Qingrong is said to be forming a troupe there, preparing to have Jin Suqin and Hua Huilin as the backbone, and is in contact with the Lee Theatre and the Taiping Theatre. Regarding this news, Suwen was asked about it, and she also admitted that there was such a thing. In that case, Suqin's getting the script and head ornaments is a preparation for performing, and not just a coincidence.
