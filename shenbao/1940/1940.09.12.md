### Japanese Troops to Advance Toward Vietnam Tomorrow from Ningming – Fierce Fighting Between Japanese and Chinese Forces at Zhennanguan – France and Japan Conclude Agreement Regarding Vietnam Issue – Hekou Railway Bridge on Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Has Been Blown Up by China

Chongqing: According to sources from Liuzhou, 2,000 Japanese troops are currently engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese troops southeast of Zhennanguan in Guangxi Province, near the Vietnamese border.

Chongqing: The situation in Vietnam has been extremely chaotic recently, and we are struggling to obtain accurate information. Suddenly, news has arrived that the Chinese side has destroyed the border railway bridge. Considering the importance of this matter, this reporter visited the spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission, who replied as follows: "The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is an important international transportation route through Vietnam. However, since June of this year, when Japan continued its aggression against China, the Vietnamese authorities have, at Japan's request, prohibited all transportation on the railway. This is a violation of international law and the Sino-French Treaty, which the Chinese government has repeatedly and sternly pointed out. Recently, Japan and the Vichy government of Vietnam have been discussing the issue of using the railway to invade China, and the discussions have become very concrete, including landing points, times, and so on. The Vietnamese side has been making concessions at every turn and is about to put them into practice. China cannot sit idly by and watch the Japanese use this railway to attack Chinese territory. At the same time, destroying the road used by the Japanese is not only a necessary measure for China, but also eliminates the Japanese excuse to use the road and exposes their attempt to invade Vietnam. Based on the above reasons, China's destruction of the Hekou Railway Bridge is the most legitimate defensive measure. In fact, not only has the bridge been destroyed, but the entire railway has also been destroyed by China to prevent the Japanese from using it." The reporter then asked what attitude China would take if the Japanese still invaded Vietnam despite the destruction of the railway. The spokesperson replied that if Japanese armed forces invaded Vietnam, China would take self-defense measures in Vietnam, as had already been formally declared by the Chinese diplomatic authorities. This policy has not changed. (Dispatch on the 11th)

Hanoi: According to reliable sources here this morning, the international bridge over the Red River in Lao Cai was destroyed by the Chinese at 4:00 PM yesterday. It is reported that the bridge has been completely destroyed. It is said that explosives were planted on the bridge before the 20th. The destruction caused panic in Lao Cai within hours, and some residents have left the country, fearing an attack. (Havas Dispatch on the 11th)

Hanoi: According to news received here, the Chinese authorities blew up the international bridge at the Yunnan-Vietnam border at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The motive is still unknown. It may be due to lower-level officials being swayed by rumors. (Havas Dispatch on the 11th)

Berlin: The German official news agency reported that, according to well-informed sources in Vichy, France and Japan signed an agreement on Vietnam yesterday. An official statement on this Japanese demand regarding Vietnam will be issued today. (Havas Dispatch on the 11th)

Singapore: According to reliable sources, tensions in Vietnam are quite high. A well-informed traveler who arrived here from Saigon today told a Reuters reporter that Governor General Decoux had sent three telegrams to President Roosevelt. The content of the telegrams is unknown, but it is believed that they pointed out the serious situation in Vietnam. It is reported that the Japanese side made three demands yesterday afternoon: (1) the right to establish three air bases in Tokyo, each with 8,000 personnel; (2) the use of the French naval base in Cam Ranh Bay (transliteration); and (3) the passage of 60,000 troops to transport to China. The locations of the airfields were not specified. It is claimed that Decoux has allowed the Japanese to occupy three airfields, stationing 1,000 personnel at each, and the passage of 20,000 troops. It is currently believed that two Japanese divisions have been surrounded by strong Chinese forces within Chinese territory. Saigon electoral groups will meet on Saturday and Sunday to discuss the situation and express strong opposition to any compromise with Japan. According to reliable sources, Decoux has declared that no agreement has been reached, but that he has received instructions to conduct discussions and grant some facilities within the limits indicated by Vichy. It is said that Decoux has told people that even within these limits, he will not allow any facilities. It is likely that the current discussions will be prolonged until the general situation in the Pacific develops favorably for Vietnam, as Decoux hopes. According to the traveler, although Vichy is exerting pressure, it is said that Decoux will likely resist it. It is also reported that General Martin, commander of the army in Vietnam, has requested to leave if the Japanese demands are indeed accepted. The traveler further stated that Vietnam believes that the Japanese, while demanding the passage of troops, also desire to seize the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Currently, the border area is full of Chinese troops. Even if a small number of Japanese troops are allowed to pass through Vietnam, these Chinese troops will take action. It is rumored that the Japanese troops besieged by the Chinese forces attempted to break out through Vietnam, but were fired upon by French troops, resulting in nearly a hundred casualties. The traveler denied that American bombers had flown to Vietnam and said that 95% of the Vietnamese people support General Tagore's doctrine, but are unable to take action due to the situation with Japan. (Reuters Dispatch on the 11th)

Chongqing: According to today's Ta Kung Pao, the Vietnamese authorities blew up the railway bridge on the "Vietnam-Guangxi" border yesterday (at Shuikou, 25 miles from Longzhou). The Guilin authorities said that the Japanese army has been significantly reinforcing the border from Longzhou. It is claimed that 4,000 Japanese troops have left Longzhou to open the border. At the same time, 5,000 volunteer students from "senior schools" recruited from Taiwan are now concentrated in Qinzhou. Sources say that the Japanese army is strengthening defenses in border cities along the Vietnam-Guangxi border, preparing to attack French territory. At the same time, the French Consul in Kunming officially denied the rumor that the French government had allowed the Japanese army to pass through Vietnam. The Consul stated that Governor General Decoux had assured him, strongly denying the rumors that Vietnam had allowed the Japanese army to pass through. According to information arriving here from Hanoi, the Franco-Japanese negotiations there have broken down. (United Press Dispatch on the 11th)

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent claimed that well-informed sources here believe that the reports from Chinese sources in Hong Kong that 12,000 Japanese troops have entered Vietnam are not very reliable and believe that the information comes from German sources. In recent days, the German side has been claiming that Tokyo and Vichy have reached a compromise to allow Japanese troops to enter Vietnam. In fact, negotiations between the Vietnamese and Japanese authorities had broken down some days ago, after two small-scale incursions by Japanese troops into Vietnamese territory near Dong Dang. (Reuters Dispatch on the 11th)

London: A Reuters political correspondent learned from authoritative sources that the impression that Franco-Japanese negotiations on Vietnam were proceeding smoothly is not supported by facts. The German and Japanese sides seem eager to make the world believe that the negotiations are still proceeding in a very friendly manner, but as far as is currently known, local talks in Vietnam have recently been broken off by the Vietnamese authorities because Japanese troops temporarily violated the border. Whether this is true has not been confirmed, but it seems that the French ambassador in Tokyo and the Japanese government are still engaged in continuous discussions. As for the claim that Chinese troops violated the Vietnamese border, this has not been confirmed, and the Chongqing government has denied it. (Reuters Dispatch on the 11th)

Tokyo: Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma stated today that the Japanese authorities stationed in Vietnam are still negotiating with the local French authorities regarding the situation in Vietnam. There have been no changes since Monday. He also said, "I hope to be able to make some announcements on this matter soon. My current position makes it inconvenient to speak." The spokesman also said that the official report from the Japanese authorities has not confirmed reports of clashes between Chinese and French troops on the Vietnamese border.

Kunming: The rumor that the Chinese army has cut off the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway near the Vietnamese border has been denied by well-informed sources here this afternoon. (Reuters Dispatch on the 11th)

Editorial

### Japan Appoints Tatekawa as Envoy to Soviet Union

Upon Fumimaro Konoe’s renewed formation of a cabinet, the adoption of Yosuke Matsuoka as Foreign Minister has largely been viewed as signaling a massive shift in Japanese diplomacy. Japanese reformists, similarly, are widely hopeful of the “startling measures” they expect of Matsuoka. And yet, since the August 1st announcement of the cabinet’s basic policy, its diplomatic dimensions, apart from trite political rhetoric, have only consisted of empty words, as Matsuoka’s statements have only served to declare a desire for further southward expansion. As for its position between the world’s two great adversarial camps, and its ambitions to break free of diplomatic isolation, there has been no indication of them in nearly two months. As such, Japan’s dispatch of Yoshitsugu Tatekawa as envoy to the Soviet Union is, truly, a fresh page in the present cabinet’s diplomatic machinations, and is the first active step since the recall of a large number of envoys and consuls in late August.

Yosuke Matsuoka’s realignment of Japan’s diplomatic ranks, along with the joint recall of the Soviet envoy Togo, even included that of the American envoy Grew, yet assessment of potential successors to the post of American envoy remains silent and unknown to this day, while the dispatch of Tatekawa as envoy to the Soviets has already spread far and wide, even being lauded as the selection of talented civilian manpower, and further accompanied by the Eurasian Bureau Director of the Foreign Ministry, Nishiharushige Gun. All of this is indicative of the importance placed upon this undertaking. This matter is, in nature, much the same as how Uagki and Nomura formerly occupied outward postings as military men of the army and navy, and the likely pivot of Matsuoka’s foreign policy in favor of the Soviets is broadly comparable to how Ugaki and Nomura’s gaze rested on England and America.

Japan, previously renowned for its anti-communist and anti-Soviet stance, has suddenly shifted and now harbors grand expectations of a relationship with the Soviet Union. This transformation suitably illustrates the rocking and wavering of Japan’s diplomatic direction, as well as its panic to resolve this diplomatic deadlock. However, this transformation, from different perspectives, is in reality not at all sudden. First, with the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, the Anti-Comintern Pact had, in essence, disintegrated, and Ribbentrop was inclined to pull the Soviets and Japanese together, although the Japanese court and the public were deeply entrenched in the German attitude of “treachery,” and there were no signs to indicate a change of hostility into friendship between the Soviets and Japanese. However, figures like Takamasa Sakai, Yoshitsugu Tatekawa, and Shiratori Toshio already harbored a sense of desire for the Soviets, and regarded pro-Sovietism as Japan’s only diplomatic outlet. Second, in terms of strategy, Japan has always been wary of fighting a two-front war, and in its development of the Northward Advance, it would always attempt to curry favor with other powers through its “anti-communism,” but the current effort for a Southward Advance will necessarily seek friendship with the Soviets to alleviate the threat in its Northern territory, and even hopes to draw up defenses from the Northeastern front with the Soviets for the Southward Advance, or for the continued invasion of China. Third, severing the external support to China has been considered an important task in Japan’s invasion of China, and with England and France successively submitting to Japan, it is not beyond possibility that Japanese authorities may harbor those same delusions regarding the Soviet Union. Fourth, and most importantly, it is that, since last winter, the Soviet Union has repeatedly expressed its desire to realign relations with Japan, and due to the unrest in the four territories of the Soviets in recent years, as well as the intimate-yet-detached relations with England and America, it too certainly hopes to live alongside Japan in peace to ensure the security of its Eastern territories. As such, as early as the era of Abe Nobuyuki, the Japanese had already harbored desires for the Soviets, and the recent Japanese efforts to develop the Southward Advance has added even more possibility of drawing the Soviets and Japanese closer. As such, in terms of the expression of a desire for the realignment of relations, the Soviets precede the Japanese, and in terms of the wishes harbored between both countries, the Japanese exceed the Soviets. In the present, even if problems of principle are easily resolved, negotiations of real and practical problems may not be entirely compliant with the wishes of most Japanese, as exemplified by the yearlong commercial treaty negotiations and territorial demarcations.

In the past, there have been rumors of a Soviet-German-Italian-Japanese alliance in the international community, and in this current moment in which Japan is attempting to better relations with the Soviets, there is a chance for those baseless claims to reemerge, and the momentum of those in various countries with an obsession in fearing the Soviets may surge even further. If these phenomena truly occur, then that would be precisely what would assist Japan’s goals and accelerate the decay of the Far East. It must be understood that the Soviets have their limitations in realigning relations with Japan, and the pro-Soviet movement of the Japanese is not without existing obstacles. In the past Anti-Comintern Pact, Germany, Italy, and Japan made anti-communism their banner, but within Japan, the anti-communist sentiment is definitely deeply present, especially among the conglomerates and the landed class, who have a deep fear of communism, and must put forth more effort to prevent the radicalization of thought among the people after years of impoverishment of the people and exhaustion of assets. Over the years, even though the Soviets have repeatedly feigned a friendly tone to the Japanese, the Japanese side has always lacked a good response, due to nothing more than fears that dangerous thoughts would rise alongside a pro-Soviet attitude. This psychological fear cannot be wiped away due to a shift in the government’s diplomatic policies, and instead appropriately forms a treacherous undercurrent of the future of Soviet-Japanese relations. On the other hand, what the Soviets wish of the Japanese is nothing more than peaceful coexistence, and to cut off the dangers of grasping at chestnuts from the fire in the Far East, and certainly not to bestow benevolence upon Japan or even to embolden its ambitions of aggression. On August 1st, Molotov’s address, on one hand declaring the progress of Soviet-Japanese relations, and on the other hand pointing out the ambiguity of the Japanese domestic and foreign policies, makes it clear that there is a lack of sufficient confidence in the Japanese. And the Soviets would not sacrifice their friendship with the Chinese to satisfy the wishes of the Japanese, and this can also be easily identified within that address.

A few days ago, news had spread that the Americans and Soviets were proceeding with diplomatic negotiations, but the Japanese side abruptly began a pro-Soviet step, which, although could be said to be a previously determined diplomatic procedure, had undoubtedly been stimulated by the aforementioned news, and was preparing to compete with the American-Soviet negotiations. China’s war of resistance will not be affected by the degree of intimacy between the Soviets and Japanese, and as for the future of the overall situation in the Far East, it must mainly be viewed based on whose Soviet diplomacy, between the Americans and Japanese, manages to achieve a visible effect.

### Chinese Army in Guinan Recaptures Shangsi City Again – Fozipingfu Also Recovered – Japanese Troops Retreat Toward Suilu

Liuzhou: The Chinese army launched a fierce assault on the Japanese strongholds in Shangsi, killing and capturing many. On the morning of the 4th, Shangsi city was recaptured.

### Japanese Troops in Southern Guangdong Increased to 20,000

Hong Kong: According to reports, the number of Japanese troops in Shenzhen has increased from 5,000 to more than 10,000. Chinese sources even say that the Japanese troop strength has increased to more than 20,000. The reason for the Japanese troop concentration is unknown, but it has caused general concern and is a major threat to Hong Kong's security. As a result, more than 2,000 British women and children have evacuated to Macau. One explanation for the increase in Japanese troops is that the Japanese want to cut off the transportation line from Shayuchong to the interior. This road is still open, and ships between Hong Kong and Shayuchong are still constantly travelling. The Japanese Consul General in Hong Kong told reporters that British police officers are searching all sailing ships and steamers arriving in Shayuchong to prevent the smuggling of munitions, gasoline, and other war materials to the interior. If smuggling is discovered, a fine of HK$500 will be imposed. A certain military unit of 1,500 men stationed on the southern border of Guangdong suddenly mutinied and defected to the command of General Xiang Hanping, the Dongjiang District Garrison Commander. The commander of the uprising was Colonel Long Jinting (transliteration). Zhongshan County also rose up in response, and 2,000 men with military supplies came to join the Chinese army. In a declaration of defection to the International News Service, Commander Long stated that he was a graduate of the sixth class of the Whampoa Military Academy in 1927. When Guangzhou fell on October 21, 1938, he joined the Japanese army, but he never stopped thinking about defecting. It is said that Long's defection was greatly appreciated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Long's unit is currently stationed in a certain area north of Shenzhen.

### Japanese Newspaper Again Advocates Improving Relations with Soviet Union - So That Japan Can Free Itself to Advance South - Tatekawa's Mission to the Soviet Union Aims Thereof

Tokyo: Japanese newspapers yesterday urged the government to improve relations with the Soviet Union, so that Japan's campaign in China could proceed smoothly, and at the same time enable Japan to free itself to advance south.

The newspaper also said, "Without the Soviet Union's consent, the New East Asia Idea will not be established."

### British Air Force Launches Fierce Counterattack, Attacks Central Berlin Area, Many Bombs Fall Near Government Offices, Famous Landmarks and Important Buildings Damaged

Berlin, Several British bombers crossed the fire net of anti-aircraft guns early this morning and carried out an aerial blitz on Berlin, dropping dozens of bombs and incendiary bombs on the center of the German capital's government seat. Before the bombing, the British planes first dropped several flares, making the capital area as bright as day, and then suddenly flew low from an altitude of 18,000 feet to bomb. The roof of the German Parliament was blown off, and the famous Brandenburg Gate (an architectural structure similar to the French Arc de Triomphe) was also damaged. Many incendiary bombs fell on the famous Pariser Platz. This British air raid was the most intense attack on Berlin so far. This British move was clearly in retaliation for the German planes' brutal bombing of London. The British planes' bombing this time was carried out by a fleet divided into four large squadrons, which suddenly broke through the fierce fire net of anti-aircraft guns and soared over Berlin, concentrating their attacks on the main areas of the capital, sometimes even flying low at an altitude of 5,000 feet and carrying out dense machine-gun strafing. Although the British planes engaged in this risky bombing for two hours, the losses caused by the bombs were not significant. An incendiary bomb fell on the right side of the front of the American Embassy, but the bomb only burned itself out, and even the doors and windows of the American Embassy were not damaged in the slightest.

According to German radio, five people were killed and three were injured. Although famous buildings and scenic areas were slightly damaged, most of the people in the streets of Berlin had been evacuated and therefore did not suffer any major harm. The air raid alert lasted from 11:55 PM to 1:47 AM (9:47 AM Shanghai time). Although the roof of the German Parliament was pierced by an incendiary bomb, it did not cause significant damage because dozens of firefighters immediately extinguished the fire. Another incendiary bomb struck the Brandenburg Gate, piercing a small hole in the top of the gate. This historical building was also not damaged. The Academy of Fine Arts near the Brandenburg Gate was also hit by an incendiary bomb, but suffered only minor damage. According to German Air Force officials, the most significant loss caused by the British planes this time was no more than £1,000. The street surface 400 yards west of the Brandenburg Gate was blown into a huge crater, five feet deep. In Dorotheenstraße, very close to Wilhelmstraße (where the German Foreign Office is located), three high-explosive bombs destroyed the roof of a government office and an apartment building, and the road surface was also blown into a hole. According to eyewitnesses, the explosions were very intense near the government offices, but there were no casualties because the residents of the buildings had all taken shelter in the basements beforehand. A United Press reporter picked up a piece of the casing of an incendiary bomb, on which was engraved, "Nova Device, 1938." An Air Force official accompanied foreign reporters to inspect the bombed areas. According to him, the British planes that participated in this air raid numbered about 15 to 20, divided into four groups flying from the west. The first group flew at an altitude of 18,000 feet, and the other groups flew lower than the first group, with the last group flying at about 5,000 feet. The British planes dropped a large number of flares, which proves that the British planes were very careful and intended to concentrate their attacks on the government area. (United Press Dispatch, 11th)

Berlin, British bombers intruded into northern Germany last night, and several of them entered the airspace of Berlin, dropping many bombs in commercial and residential areas, hitting several buildings that were not only "national" but also of "international importance," such as the world-renowned "German Engineering Association Building," which was also set on fire by the bombing. The "Academy of Arts" near the American Embassy was also hit by the bombing, and the "Hedwig Hospital" in the city was also hit by incendiary bombs. The "German Engineering Association Building" has been the venue for several international scientific conferences, and the Academy of Arts contains countless masterpieces by famous domestic and foreign artists. (Haitong Dispatch, 11th)

London, The British Air Ministry announced today that, in retaliation, British planes have also carried out attacks of equal destruction on the German side. It is reported that British bombers flew over thousands of miles of Europe and launched heavy bombing raids on more than 20 cities and German-occupied areas on the German side. Large formations of British planes took off from various bases, crossed the European continent, and went deep into Germany, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, inflicting heavy damage on German airfields and ship concentration areas on the French and Dutch coasts. Berlin and the important German port of Hamburg were heavily bombed. The announcement stated that only three British planes were lost in this large-scale air raid. (International Dispatch, 11th)

Berlin, This afternoon, the German military report stated that several enemy planes dropped bombs in northern France, Belgium, and northern Germany last night, with very little damage. Enemy planes flew to Berlin to drop bombs, and fires broke out in several places in residential and commercial areas. Two buildings in hospitals were also hit by bombs. A bomb landed on the Parliament building, and another bomb landed on the Academy of Fine Arts. Several civilians were killed or injured, with five deaths.

### Britain Uses New Air Combat Weapon, Drops Spontaneous Combustion Discs Causing Forest Fires

London, According to news released today, the British side has dropped thousands of "spontaneous combustion discs." These bombs can self-ignite at normal temperatures after several hours. Hundreds of fires have been ignited in German forests and fields. One British plane dropped more than 200,000 of these "spontaneous combustion discs." (International Dispatch, 11th) According to official announcements, Britain began using "ignition pills" after the 11th of last month to burn down farmhouses and forests in many places. These pills are tightly attached to the center of a simulated ivory disc with a diameter of five inches, along with cotton. These pills can burn when exposed to air, with flames about one meter long. These pills cannot destroy military targets, but many farmhouses and forests have been destroyed. We can touch these pills or put them in a bag, and they can burn. It is reported that British planes have dropped millions of these pills in Germany, with about 250 pills dropped by one plane. (Haitong Dispatch, 11th)

London, The Air Ministry stated that the British Air Force launched a fierce aerial counterattack against German territory and military targets in the occupied areas of the Netherlands, Belgium, and France yesterday morning, heavily attacking the Berlin power plant, the Bremen and Hamburg shipyards, the Kiel-Wilhelmshaven and Wismar docks, warehouses in Brussels, factories in Essen, railway lines, and several airfields. The German gun positions at Gris-Nez in France and the ships concentrated at Ostend, Calais, and Boulogne harbor were also bombed. Only three British planes did not return. The Air Ministry's information office published a statement from a British coastal airfield pilot describing the results of their bombing of Boulogne. The attack on the port was carried out by Blenheim aircraft, which found the target in dense clouds. The main pier buildings were hit and caught fire. Due to the heavy floating clouds, the flames could not be seen clearly, but the edges of the clouds were brightly illuminated. Twenty minutes later, the ground became clearer when viewed from above. Other Blenheim aircraft followed and dropped bombs inside and around the artillery factory. The enemy's stored ammunition then exploded, and the red light shot straight through the clouds. Other British coastal aircraft and naval aviation units attacked ships in Calais, Ostend, and Flessingue harbor, dropping nine tons of bombs. The enemy's coastal artillery and escort ships offered resistance, but the British planes still achieved significant results.

The targets attacked in Berlin included the important Dökel gas plant in the suburbs. The British planes began a fierce attack on the target around midnight, braving intense anti-aircraft fire, and saw the bombs hit the target and explode with a roar. The area that was most heavily attacked by British planes last night was the naval shipyard in Hamburg, which was continuously bombed for half an hour, dropping many high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs. The warehouses in Bagenhafen were bombed, and fires broke out in many places. The airfields in Dievels, Hoyas, Seel, Cuxhaven, and Shibell were also attacked. Ships in Calais harbor were repeatedly dive-bombed by British planes for more than an hour. (Reuters Dispatch, 11th)

### British Naval Power Greatly Enhanced, British Naval Chief Expresses Gratitude for US Ship Transfer

Alexander stated, "We welcome all transfers to the strength of this Navy, but none more than the welcome of these destroyers. Therefore, I say to the US Navy, 'Thank you for your gift.' Our naval power is increasing every week, so there is more than enough to resist enemy submarines." Alexander's speech came shortly after the air raid alert yesterday afternoon. He said, "The enemy will soon get the price they are giving us at sea and on land. Seeing the recent courage of the British people in the face of disaster, we are increasingly confident that we can persevere to the end." (United Press Dispatch, 11th)

British searchlights searched the sky, while a net of anti-aircraft fire from the ground made it difficult for German planes to cross. However, the German planes made a fierce effort and finally found a gap after midnight, allowing all the bombers to rush in. The invading German planes made terrible noises. Witnesses said that the number of planes was no less than the German planes that raided London on Monday and Tuesday. Initially, seeing that their attempt to break into London could not be realized, the German planes followed the instructions issued by the radio and flew to the industrial areas of Scotland, Wales, and the Midlands, carrying out several brutal bombing raids. An official announcement stated that a hospital in a city on the southeast coast was destroyed, and all the patients were killed. (International Dispatch, 11th)

London, London issued its fifth air raid alert at 8:12 PM yesterday afternoon (4:12 AM Shanghai summer time). At the same time, the British authorities are studying a recent report stating that Germany is preparing for a possible trans-Channel attack on the British Isles. It is now believed that Germany's intensified bombing of Britain may be a prelude to the invasion of the British Isles. Experts point out that before launching an invasion, Germany must first destroy London's important military ports, cut off transportation hubs, and disperse the strength of the Royal Air Force along the coastlines. According to reports from British engineers, the German army has already been stationed in front of the Channel.

### Large Group of German Planes Attacks London Yesterday Afternoon Unsuccessfully

London, Unprecedentedly large anti-aircraft fire and effective fire-breathing aircraft attacks completely prevented a large group of German planes, including 50 that were bombing the Thames area, from entering London this afternoon. The city issued an alert at 3:19 PM and lifted it at 3:55 PM (11:55 PM Shanghai time). In the fierce air battle, five German planes were shot down.

### Germany Launches Retaliatory Air Raids to Force Britain to Surrender

Berlin, Large formations of German planes continued to roar over London yesterday, carrying out "retaliatory" bombing. The Germans said that this bombing will not stop until the main military and industrial targets of England are reduced to ashes, the main force of the British Air Force is destroyed, and the British are discouraged and prepared to accept Germany's peace terms. According to neutral observers, the so-called "peace terms" are the same as the previous examples of Poland, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, that is, unconditional surrender. German officials are very tight-lipped about the "peace terms," but well-informed sources have long believed that Britain's surrender is only "a matter of weeks." These people openly declared that peace will be unimaginable "until the poisonous British forces are driven out of Europe and the danger of restoring the old British multi-headed imperialism is eliminated." (United Press Dispatch, 11th)

### Italian Planes Run Rampant, Bombing Holy Land, Hundreds of Civilians Killed or Injured

Cairo, It was announced here today that 50 civilians were killed by bombs when Italian military aircraft bombed a Jewish church near Jerusalem on Sunday afternoon. Since Italy joined the war, its air force has been running rampant and bombing indiscriminately, causing many houses to be hit and set on fire. However, the fires were extinguished early and the damage was not extensive. The Italian Air Force's goal seems to be to bomb the most densely populated cities in the Holy Land. The city originally had 5,000 residents, which has increased to 150,000 in the past 20 years. There are no military targets in the area, and the bodies of the people killed in the bombing were still being excavated as of last night. (United Press Dispatch, 11th)

At the same time, the number of German transports gathering at sea in the area is also increasing daily. It is believed that the German military's strength is sufficient to blockade the Channel military ports and launch a blitzkrieg against Britain. At the same time, it is also believed that the German army has concentrated equal forces at various points in the North Sea. Neutral parties believe that once Germany launches an invasion of Britain, German air squadrons must first try to prevent the Royal Air Force from taking off, or fight them to the death, so that large groups of soldiers can land elsewhere.

A reporter spoke with several people who were saying goodbye to their wives and said that the war was already at the gates of London and it was more of a burden to keep their children at home. Blank, a famous general from the European War, was also saying goodbye to his wife, saying, "Rather than putting the family in an air-raid shelter to suffer the shock of bombs, it is better to separate today." Blank's words can summarize the emotions of everyone. The reporter also saw a young woman bidding farewell to her husband, saying, "Perhaps when I mail a letter, the address will be 'No. 4 Bombed Street, Southwest London, addressless house.'" It was extremely witty. (United Press Dispatch, 11th)

New Jersey Beaches – Defense Works Should be Built

Atlantic City, New Jersey – Toth, a commissioner of the state's Aviation Committee, recently expressed his opinion, strongly advocating the establishment of strong defense works on the state's flat beaches, as this area is an ideal landing site for enemy invasions. He said, "Historically, these smooth beaches have attracted pirates, been used for landings by British forces during the Revolutionary War, and been exploited by smugglers. These beaches are not only ideal landing sites for flat-bottomed boats, but also natural airfields, with good roads leading directly to important industrial centers, crossing the Delaware River, across which are Philadelphia and Wilmington. Therefore, coastal defense works must be built quickly, with both land and air forces being considered." (International News Service Dispatch, 11th)

### European War Talks (5) – The Day Paris Fell

This article is divided into two parts: The first part describes the negotiations between the German military envoys and the representatives of the Paris garrison commander regarding the unconditional surrender of Paris. It is based on the records of a German orderly officer, one of the military envoys, by Dr. Wilhelm Ritter von Schramm. The original text was published in a special issue of the Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung on July 25th; the second part describes the entry of German troops into Paris, as recorded by Louis P. Lochner, a Berlin-based correspondent for United Press. He has been the director of the United Press Berlin branch for twelve years. Since the beginning of the war, he has reported on the war news from the German side, and has always been known for his accuracy. These are translated separately as follows:

At dawn on June 13th of this year, our German troops forcibly crossed the Oise River. By this time, the outskirts of Paris had been breached. Although the French troops were already exhausted, they did not flee, but were using strong rear-guard fire to cover the slow retreat of large units. Their artillery had previously bombarded our army fiercely.

Since capturing Chantilly, the world-famous racetrack and scenic spot, everything seen has become more and more Parisian. Gardens, villas, and villages are all scenes of the suburbs of Paris, but at the same time, they have also entered the range of French artillery. It was still unpredictable at this time whether the French army would lay down its arms from now on and no longer resist, or would fight to the death behind the city walls to settle the matter.

At noon that day, the situation suddenly became tense. Major H, the Chief of Staff of our Army Corps, told me that in the evening, military envoys would be sent to Paris to demand surrender, and I was also selected as one of them. This was decided by General Köchler, the division commander. He personally went to the front line in the morning to inspect and believed that the time had come. So, on the one hand, he drafted an outline of the armistice terms and requested approval from the highest military authorities. On the other hand, he sent a public telegram to the Paris garrison commander by radio, stating:

German military envoys are scheduled to arrive north of Saint-Denis between 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM, at the intersection of the Paris-Dunkirk and Calais national highways, to negotiate the terms of the armistice in the Paris area with French representatives.

Our group of military envoys was led by Major H as the head of the delegation, Captain H as the translator, and I as the orderly officer. In addition, there were two drivers and a corporal, traveling in two cars. At that time, it was raining heavily. Soon, we reached the front line of our army. Apart from occasional artillery fire, there was no gunfire at all, indicating that the enemy troops were retreating. The front line of our army was only ten kilometers away from the enemy's first line of defense, the artillery forts in the mountains. If we advanced further, the enemy troops could fire densely at us from the forests and villages. But we ignored everything and continued to advance. In a few minutes, we reached the artillery positions of our army's front-line machine guns and tanks. We asked them where our army's outposts were stationed, but they could not answer because they did not know their own location. At that time, several shells flew from the left in front of us and landed on the roadside. When we saw that the situation was not right and that there were many dangers ahead, we had to take a bugler with us, because taking another step forward would be "no man's land." On both sides of us were fields, gardens, and scattered villages, clearly indicating that we had set foot in the suburban residential area of Paris.

At this time, it was probably around 7:00 PM, the sky was dim, and after the thunderstorm, a black mist still had not cleared above our heads. The surrounding environment was very disturbing. Where exactly were the French troops? We did not know at all. It was certain that they had not completely retreated. The current silence without firing was only temporary. We did not know whether they had received the telegram sent by our army headquarters. Everyone thought about it and became uneasy. We had to squat in the car silently, not daring to speak loudly. For safety's sake, we also got a top-notch bugler from the outpost station to prepare to move forward blowing the trumpet if necessary. The white flag originally hung on the car was too small to be displayed freely.

The car drove down the hillside, the speed was slow at first, and then it accelerated again. Suddenly, near the French artillery fort, a column of thick smoke shot straight into the sky, followed by another one. Perhaps they were already burning their own oil depots? I saw that the situation was getting worse and worse, so I had to tell the bugler to stand in front of the car and blow the military bugle of "truce" three times with all his might, but there was no response. We had to bite the bullet and continue to advance, but we still did not see the French military envoys waiting for us. It was quiet all around, with only a few shells occasionally flying from the left. On the right, the oil depot was still burning, with black smoke and flames soaring into the sky.

In an instant, obstacles were found on the road ahead, preventing the car from moving forward. The car had to slow down. I also told the bugler to blow another round with force. We had reached the intersection of the Paris national road, and French military envoys should be waiting for us. I told the car to drive very, very slowly, and got out of the car to walk. I could see shadows moving quickly in the dark next to the road. No sooner said than done, bullets had flown from the side of the road. We shouted "Stop! Stop!" and waved the white flag, but the more we shouted, the denser the bullets came, like crazy, and the machine guns in the distance were also echoing and opening fire.

In this awkward environment, we could not advance and could not retreat. The car had been hit by many bullets. If we revealed ourselves any further, even if we held a white flag, we would surely die. This place was five kilometers away from the German front line and only two hundred meters away from the French defense line. There was almost no way out except to take another road. But the most urgent thing was to deal with the situation at hand. Major H gathered all six of us under the wall in front of the garden. Except for eight bullets, the other three were empty-handed. The air around us was particularly tense, and enemy shells were bombarding both sides of the road.

We dodged and hid, fearing that the bullets would hit us. Looking at the nearby situation, it was evident that French soldiers were still stationed there, and it was difficult to advance. Major H took the lead and had already slipped away to find a way out. We also ran and dashed forward to the left and right. Those with guns acted as vanguards, ready to counterattack in an emergency. We finally managed to pass through a village, and when we looked up, we saw several sentries from our own team coming to help. This was a pleasant surprise! It turned out that they had heard the sound of gunfire and artillery in the road and were afraid that something might have gone wrong with us, so they came to rescue us.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Slightly Tight

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed prices. The black market for British and American exchange rebounded and tightened, but British gold was quite stable. Only speculators in American exchange suddenly thought of buying in, and their positions were slightly insufficient. In the middle of the day, there were rumors that the Chinese army had entered Vietnam and that the railway bridge at the Sino-Vietnamese border had been destroyed. People were speculating, and it was difficult to distinguish whether the news was bullish or bearish. However, some speculators tended to buy in. In the morning, the US dollar first loosened to $5.375, but by the afternoon close, it had narrowed to $5.28125, tighter by .0625 compared to the previous day. British gold remained at 3 ½ pence, unchanged from the previous day. The trend of futures was similar to that of spot.

Japanese Bank Quite Willing to Sell

In the morning, London telegraphic transfers for near-term delivery rose .0625, and those for forward delivery rose .1875. New York silver prices remained flat, and London spot gold was stable. The exchange rate of British pounds against US dollars was unchanged, and against Shanghai it was also flat. The US dollar was unchanged against the British pound, rose slightly against Shanghai by .05, and there was no market against the French franc. The central bank's listed exchange rates for various currencies remained the same. In the morning, banks opened with spot selling prices of 3 shillings 5.15625 pence for British gold and $5.34375 for the US dollar, slightly higher by .015625 pence for British gold and stable for the US dollar compared to the previous day's evening close. After the opening, there was a lack of buyers, so foreign banks appeared to loosen the US dollar to $5.375. HSBC's listed prices were announced, still unchanged. The silver balancing tax was increased by .25%. After this, there was a slight bullish atmosphere, and speculators came to the market to settle, absorbing Hua Bank's September US dollar at $5.34375. Subsequently, foreign banks and American banks entered with a similar US dollar price softening to $5.3125. Then, they purchased October US dollar futures at a price of $5.28125. Suddenly, the Japanese bank came to sell, with the Japanese Bank of Korea selling US dollars at $5.3125 for this month. However, near noon, sellers did not advance, and demand was quite enthusiastic, so the underlying trend ultimately softened. The closing price in the afternoon was 3 ½ pence for British gold and $5.28125 for the US dollar. The price for this month was the same as the spot price. October British gold was 3 shillings 4.84375 pence and the US dollar was $5.25, compared to the previous day's British gold unchanged and the US dollar tighter by .0625. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

Hong Kong US Dollar Tightens

Hong Kong, 11th (Wednesday) – This morning's exchange market opened flat. British exchange for both spot and futures was unchanged. US dollar spot tightened by .0625 to $22.8125. Shanghai exchange spot fell by $1 to $424. Japanese exchange spot, HSBC's listed price was unchanged, still standing at $96.5. The Bank of Japan listed at $105.5. At 9:30, it was flat. Shanghai exchange spot rose by $1 to $425. At 9:55, the US dollar tightened again, narrowing by .0625, with spot at $22.75. At 10:05, Shanghai exchange spot continued to rise by $1 to $426. At 11:50, British was flat and the US was slightly tighter. US dollar spot tightened again by .0625 to $22.6875. Shanghai exchange spot rose again by $1 to $427. The rest was unchanged. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

Tianjin British Loosens, US is Flat

Tianjin, 11th (Wednesday) – This morning's exchange market opened flat. British exchange spot loosened by .03125 to 3 shillings 3.34375 pence. US dollar spot still stood at $5.0625. Shanghai exchange rose by half a yuan to $106. "Lianchao" (Joint Currency) black market soared by $1.75 to $90.

### Vietnam Tense, Gold Market Flourishes

Yesterday, the cash gold black market rebounded sharply, and people were universally optimistic. The reason was the softening of the exchange market and the various confusing news from Vietnam. Although operators did not understand the facts, many were eager to buy slightly, so the buying trend at the low price in the morning could be described as fierce. Soon, it went out of the customs at $6,200, with a very slight pullback in the middle. By the close, it had reached $6,230, a large increase of $87 compared to the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. The off-market was flat, and half-day trading was still active, about 3,000 taels. Gold jewelry shops ultimately raised the price by $10, and customs gold etc. remained flat.

Gold Rose $87

The morning opened flat, slightly raising by $2. Gold shops entered money exchange for 20 taels at $6,145. Subsequently, due to the exchange market loosening slightly, the trend softened, and silver shops helped to sell. Moreover, there were very few buyers at the time, and it was once pressed to a low of $6,130. Then, the foreign exchange turned tight, and gold shops helped to compete to buy in. In addition, a certain silver shop also tracked and vigorously entered. Although a certain money exchange shop supplied in the middle, because many households had strong bullish sentiments, positions ultimately felt that demand exceeded supply, rising to $6,205. After this, the buying trend once subsided, and money exchange shops continued to sell, and another silver shop even turned from long to short, estimating that it sold thousands of taels, so it once slightly retreated to $6,185. Unexpectedly, before long, bullish rumors suddenly spread in the market, and the people's hearts revived for a time. Silver shops, money exchange shops, etc. searched incessantly, and sellers decreased, so it rose to $6,230. At noon, a certain gold shop made a profit and sold again, falling to $6,225. However, the result ultimately rose back to a closing price of $6,230 due to strong public sentiment, an increase of $87 compared to the previous day. There was a fluctuation of $100 in half a day. The selling price of spot gold in gold shops was tens of dollars higher than the cash gold, and the buying price was reduced by $30. The current standard gold was more than $50 lower than the listed gold, and there was little opening.

Jewelry Gold was Listed at $10 More Yesterday

The selling price of gold jewelry in silver shops was initially $630 per tael by Tai Tung Hang. By noon, it had been listed at $10 more, with Tai Tung Hang changing the listing to $640. The new counterparts were similar to the previous price, and the buying price was reduced by about $30.

### Demand for US Dollars is Again Eager

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw cash gold suddenly rise sharply again. British and American gold pounds also rose by $2.50 each. British gold notes rose and then returned to flat, with the evening market still standing at the original price of $55.50. US dollar notes were in high demand again due to the black market US dollar trending tight and strong again, reaching $18.82 in the evening, an increase of $0.26 compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes rose and then returned to flat, with the evening market still standing at the original price of $4.32. The supply of Japanese gold notes was relatively strong, and the market price was slightly weak, at $1.54 in the evening. Korean notes were in high demand again, reaching $1.11 in the evening.

### New Two-Cent Banknote from the Farmers Bank of China

Because of the prior shortage of one-yuan and one-cent banknotes in this city, measures have been taken to transport them to Shanghai one after another. The new one-cent and two-cent banknotes of the Bank of China have already been reported in this newspaper. Now, the Joint Reserve Committee of the banking industry has transported a batch of cent notes, among which is the two-cent note printed in the 26th year of the Republic (1937) by the Farmers Bank of China. The front is green, and the back is a mixture of three colors. It was printed by China General Enterprise Co. A special plate is made below.

### Food: Rice Prices Slightly Rebound, Rumors of a Slight Drop of One or Two Yuan, Arrival of Japonica Rice Is Not Small

The off-exchange trading of foreign rice remains volatile, and there is no way to stop it. However, due to the continuous soaring prices, reaching the peak, and concerns about the high prices, some speculators are quite troubled. Moreover, with substantial profits already in hand, some have returned to the market yesterday. A large increase followed by a small drop is a normal occurrence in the market. Furthermore, after verification by public opinion, although there are problems in Vietnam, Siam and Burma can still transport rice. In addition, yesterday's actual sales were slow, transshipment was suspended, and those who followed the trend could not help but wait and see. The actual sales in this street were sluggish, so the total daily transaction was only nearly 4,000 bags. The price of Yinghua Company's original package of rice, which was previously 77 yuan, fell to 75 yuan yesterday, but there were few buyers. Therefore, the market price has fallen by 2 yuan, and the transaction price of current rice has also fallen by 1 or 2 yuan. However, only the mills are entering and leaving the market; others are still trading off-exchange in the black market. It is rumored that No. 1 Saigon rice has fallen to 68 or 69 yuan, "fire pattern" rice to 66 or 67 yuan, No. 2 Saigon rice to around 64 yuan, No. 2 Siamese "small pattern" rice to 62.5 yuan or 62 yuan, Tokyo "polished tip" rice to 58 or 59 yuan, "rice mung bean" to 54 or 55 yuan, and inferior rice to 52 yuan.

Regardless of the official or unofficial market, japonica and domestic glutinous rice are consistently firm. Merchants feel it is not easy to promote sales, and their interest in purchasing is weakening. At the same time, sellers know that it is difficult to raise prices further, so the asking prices are flat and show no profit or loss. Although the initial price of "Cha Chang" broken japonica rice was shouted to over 80 yuan, it was not realized due to the extremely high price. Only ordinary goods were offered at 78 or 79 yuan, "Wu Chang Su Kun" broken japonica rice at around 78 yuan, inferior rice at 75 or 76 yuan, "Qing Jiao thin broken" at 76 yuan, "Nan Gang" original package of early broken rice at 74 yuan, and bulk broken rice at 71 or 72 yuan. Although the arrival of new japonica rice and new "Yang tip" rice is limited, the sales are not good, and supply and demand are similar, so prices are maintained. New Zhoupu japonica rice is still offered at 72.5 yuan, and "tidal soft" rice at 71.5 yuan. The original package of "Taicang Yang tip" rice is 64 or 65 yuan, and bulk rice is around 63 yuan. As for glutinous rice, domestic goods are stable due to scarcity. "Jin Li Te Yuan" is still 71.5 yuan or 71 yuan. However, the price of foreign glutinous rice has slightly fallen by half a yuan due to the decline in foreign rice prices, and it is on par with domestic goods. Yesterday, the first batch of seasonal delicacies, six stones of Kunshan fragrant japonica rice, arrived. Due to its fragrant and delicious taste, it was well-received and quickly sold out at a price of 77 yuan. A total of 1,100 to 1,200 bags of new and old japonica and glutinous rice arrived.

### Futures Flour Loosen, Wheat Transactions Mutually Reject

Flour: Yesterday, the spot market was firm, but the futures market was weak. The stock of No. 2 flour mill was still 15.5 yuan, only for retail sales in this street. The supply from the two mills was only 5,000 to 6,000 bags. Due to the current shortage of raw materials and the lack of arrival of foreign wheat, the spot flour is becoming increasingly scarce. The Phoenix brand of Japanese flour also needs 15.4 yuan, an increase of 5 cents from before. However, the prices of September lower and October futures fell due to the small decline in rice prices and the exit of bulls. The price of September lower fell from 15.48 yuan to 15.37 yuan, and the price of October fell from 15.82 yuan to 15.74 yuan, both lower by 10 to 15 cents compared to the previous day, showing a trend of firm spot and weak futures. The sales of foreign flour continued to fluctuate, mostly for direct transshipment. The market price was still 17.3 or 17.4 yuan.

Wheat: Yesterday's transactions were quiet again. Because the Japanese firms re-emphasized buying, the price was limited to only 21 yuan. Although Chinese factories are willing to lower prices to buy, there is no goods to buy. In contrast, the market participants held on to their positions, and no transactions were heard throughout the day.

### Securities: Profit-Taking Emerges, Domestic Debt Reverses and Plummets

The off-exchange securities market underwent a sudden change yesterday, with prices falling by several jiao to more than one yuan. This is also the inevitable result of the previous price manipulation. The magnitude of the price increase was unexpected by anyone. The continuous outflow of physical goods led to the decline. Although some bulls exited the market, many spot goods also flowed out. Heng Kang, Lian He, Lian Yi, Yong Chang, Ju Xu, Ji Ji, No. 4, and No. 16 all sought to sell. The number of short covering or long positions was limited. Tong Kang had more buying than selling. Yi Tai, Heng Fu, Chang Ji, Ren Chang, and Sheng Da all bought to cover positions. With the decline already underway, it may not be easy to reverse the trend for a while. As a result, the market price fell uniformly by 7 jiao to 1.2 yuan, with a turnover of about 1.8 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

In stock trading, 500 shares of Chinese Merchants Electric Company were traded at a price of 5.8 yuan.

Furthermore, the Public Industry Association reported that the news had improved and the stock market had rebounded. The previous day's declines had all been recovered. The rise in reclamation stocks was particularly alarming, opening at only 24 yuan and then rising to a high of 27.25 yuan. The closing price slightly fell to 26.5 yuan for buying and 26.75 yuan for selling. The reasons for the stock's rise are difficult to ascertain. It was only heard that a good report on the company's operations would be released soon. Although rubber stocks were stable, they were ignored.

London, October 10 (Tuesday) Cable: Today's stock market listings for Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British companies. Bank stocks showed renewed vitality. Mercantile Bank shares rose 3 pence to £6 10s. HSBC London registered shares rose half a pound to £66, and Hong Kong registered shares rose one pound to £72. The rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: Sales Channels Narrow, Yarn Market Struggles to Rebound

The yarn market, which fell sharply the previous day, showed signs of hovering yesterday. Actual sales by merchant groups remained sluggish. This is because traffic obstructions have narrowed the sales channels for yarn, so the situation is particularly weak. Most speculators are in long positions, and the general public's goal is to sell high and buy low. As a result, the market price fluctuates from time to time. The fundamental problem is the large inventory of yarn. Unless there is a significant increase in the consumption of cotton yarn itself, the market is unlikely to rise significantly.

The opening price of spot yarn in the morning was flat. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn opened at 975 yuan, and soon fell to 967 yuan. Then, due to the quiet exchange rate and short covering, some bulls came to buy a few bales, and those who rushed to buy followed suit. The market situation suddenly tightened. It was also said that gold had risen, and the buying trend was slightly stronger, rising directly to 984 yuan. At this time, the bulls sold out, and the price fell by several yuan again. Around 11 o'clock, the price rebounded to 989 yuan due to short covering. The price slightly weakened after the close. According to statistics, 3,150 bales were traded in half a day. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 5 yuan. Today, there were 1,980 pieces of cotton yarn and 380 pieces of cotton cloth shipped to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each gang is listed below:

Tong Xing: 2,880, Hong Kong: 260, Xiamen: 10, Total: 3,150

### No Transactions in Spot Cotton

The spot cotton market was extremely sluggish. Because the yarn market was not doing well, the factories had no interest. Therefore, people were watching and not moving. No spot cotton transaction was made.

Another report: The foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, slightly weakened in the early morning due to the funds cashed out by southern groups, and then rebounded due to purchases by colleagues and Wall Street. As a result, the closing price was flat for the near term and up 2 points for the far term compared to the previous day. The Indian market was closed. The forecast is for the price to rise.

The transaction of Shanghai foreign cotton has been very quiet in recent days. Because there are many things happening in Vietnam, the yarn price could not be boosted, and the factories are taking a wait-and-see attitude. There were also very few transactions between colleagues.

### Oilseed Cake: Arrival Continues to Increase, Oil Market Slightly Declines

Yesterday's crude soybean oil market declined slightly in the morning due to the continued increase in arrivals and market nervousness. In the afternoon, it was resisted by speculators, so both soybean oil and crude oil showed some rebound. However, the overall situation may not escape the environment of oversupply. According to statistics, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou crude oil were traded at a price of 63.5 yuan, 300 pieces for delivery in three or four days at a price of 63 yuan, 300 pieces for delivery in September at a price of 63 yuan, 300 pieces for delivery in October at a price of 64 yuan, 250 pieces for delivery in the afternoon in October at a price of 64.5 yuan, and 250 pieces for delivery in October at a price of 64.5 yuan in the afternoon at a price of 65 yuan, 50 barrels of Qingdao crude oil at a price of 90 yuan, and 20 barrels of Dalian soybean oil at a price of 100 yuan, 50 pieces of soybean oil from Da You Yu Factory at a low price of 75 yuan, according to Lao Zhan Dan.

Also, 1,150 cans of crude oil arrived from Yantai yesterday, and 3,840 cans arrived from Qingdao.

Today, 2,040 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Mediocre

Yesterday's sugar market association set the price of new No. 24 coarse white sugar at 78.5 yuan, Dutch cotton white BS mark at 74 yuan, KD mark at 73.8 yuan, Dutch at 63 yuan, road goods at 62.5 yuan, Taikoo B mark opened at 77 yuan, and then at 76.5 yuan. DY mark at 73.3 yuan, HX mark at 73.2 yuan, up 2 jiao, Dongxiang red slightly oily price at 59 yuan, traded more than 50 bags.

Also, 650 bags of sugar were shipped from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Coal: Kai Ping Culm Uniquely Expensive

Kai Ping coal culm, recently, the price has invisibly risen due to the expensive Japanese gold, and the goods in Shanghai are few. The market is gradually tense. It is estimated that the first-class culm of Kai Ping is 160 yuan per ton, and the second-class layer is 136 yuan, which is 10 yuan higher than the previous week. However, the above is the price between colleagues. The handling fee of the warehouse is added separately.

### Medicinal Materials: Ga-liang Ginger Turns to Rise

Recently, because the arrival of Ga-liang ginger has not continued, the market stock is declared lacking, and Da-liang is especially rare. Therefore, the previous price of 42 yuan has now risen to 45 yuan, a good rise of 3 yuan, and so on.

### North-South Goods: New Peach Kernels Offered

Recently, new peach kernels have arrived one after another, totaling more than 200 pieces. The initial small number arrived at 210 yuan, but yesterday it has loosened, opening at 205 yuan to 203 yuan, down 5 yuan to 7 yuan.

### Buddha's Hand Fruit Production Price is Expensive

Long-shaped Buddha's Hand white fruit, produced in Dongting Mountain of Suzhou, has a very poor harvest this year, so the production price is extremely expensive, increasing by more than two times compared to last year, and the market price is also 20 to 30 yuan higher. It will soon arrive in central China to be offered as a new product.

### Seafood: Yantai Abalone Arrival is Rare

Recently, a small number of Yantai abalone have been shipped in, and they are sold immediately. It is estimated that four boxes of high-quality dried abalone from Jin were priced at 366 yuan, and ten boxes of slightly moist abalone were priced at 345 yuan. The situation is very brisk.

### Idle Talk: "Small Money Shops"

— Mo Fei

A Paradise for Speculators

Shanghai is full of gold, and it can be picked up everywhere. I often hear people say that a certain celebrity came to Shanghai in a green cloth gown and, through hard work, finally became a wealthy man. Another person started as a pauper and accumulated a fortune of 1 to 2 million. Shanghai has long been a paradise for adventurers. Until now, everything has become the object of speculation. It is "always like this, and even more so now."

There are many "ways to make money." Here, let's talk about the "small money shops," those "small money shops" that buy and sell foreign currencies on behalf of customers, with Sichuan Road and Jiangxi Road as their main base. (There are also those that rent office buildings.) Many of their shareholders and clerks used to work in the gold exchange before the war, but some are "halfway converts." They can be roughly divided into Zhenjiang gangs, Shaoxing gangs, Ningbo gangs, etc.

Not long ago, those "small money shops" bought and sold foreign currencies on behalf of customers on a cash basis, earning only commissions, so the business was not outstanding.

The Popularization of Speculation

Later, some companies started trading futures, only trading US dollar notes, which became the only darling of speculators when the war began. With only 200 to 300 yuan of margin, customers could buy or sell US dollar notes for 100 US dollars. The "small money shops" earned extra profits in addition to interest, and their positions were also ample. For customers, getting rich seemed to have opened up a shortcut, and more people wanted to get rich by betting small amounts. Many "small money shops" came into being in response. Recently, even small-amount US dollar note transactions have been created: with 30 yuan of national currency as margin, you can buy and sell 10 yuan of US dollar notes. It can truly be called "popularization."

Some "small money shops" have specially arranged exquisite "parlor"-style or "bar"-style rooms. Some also straightforwardly hang a blackboard on the wall in the center, and place long benches on three sides, like a classroom, for customers who come to buy and sell.

From 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., the "small money shops" are "crowded!" In those "parlors," "bars," and "classrooms," people of all kinds are packed: teachers, wealthy people from the countryside, university students, low-paid clerks, unemployed people, and ladies. Among them, university students want to earn some money for dancing girls, clerks want to earn some subsidies, and the unemployed want to earn a day's living expenses. However, the most eye-catching are those beautiful ladies. They run out of their homes and kitchens, or because mahjong no longer interests them, they carry full white wallets and ask, "What's the price of US dollar notes?"

Most Skilled at Eating, Scaring, and Cheating

Customers sit in the "parlors," "bars," and "classrooms." The clerks and accountants sit at the desks lying across the center of the room. (Those in the "bar" style sit inside the counter.) There are at least seven or eight telephones on the counter, one of which is directly connected to the "Association." The clerks listen to the phone and report the market conditions, and then start trading.

Many clerks in small money shops take the opportunity to eat, scare, and cheat. (Or say, "business experience." The one listening to the phone is "bright," and the one sitting on the chair is blind.) "Eating the plate" is commonplace. The more harmful thing is scaring: creating bullish or bearish "news" to stir up trouble and reap the benefits. There is also cheating, which only outsiders will fall for. A clerk in a small money shop said, "We especially welcome university students. Many university students can't even figure out the interest!"

However, some small money shops also try to maintain their reputation. Of course, these money shops focus on protecting their own credibility and are unwilling to do those three things. However, "greasing the palm" (running in and out) is still unavoidable.

### How to Purchase Woolen Suits

— Runan

When purchasing woolen fabrics, you must first determine your purpose. First determine whether it is for single-layer cotton clothes, long robes, short shirts, or vests and trousers. Then choose the fabric. Otherwise, when purchasing, the shop assistant will talk non-stop and embellish the fabric. You will be easily misled and still be cheated, even if you think you are smart. When purchasing goods, avoid doing so at night, because the color under the electric light is completely different from the color in the sunlight. When entering a woolen shop, it is best to observe all the goods in the showcase first (because all the new colors are mostly displayed in the window first). If you see something you like, you can ask the shop assistant to take it to the counter one by one, and then carefully evaluate and select it. Test the wool and yarn to see if it is good or bad. The method of testing yarn and wool has been mentioned before. Good and bad, those that are firm, shiny, soft, and glutinous are good, and vice versa, those that are loose, rough, and hard are bad. When buying woolen fabrics on Chessboard Street, it is greedy to have many shops and a wide variety of colors. Compare each other across the street. Before the war, 70% to 80% could be bargained. After the war, most have changed to fixed sizes without bargaining. However, clever customers should not rush to buy, spend more time, and not be afraid of trouble. Visit and compare each shop, and inquire about prices. As the saying goes, "Shop around before you buy." The price per yard is slightly cheaper than the price per foot.

To tailor a suit, naturally go to a tailor shop. The best tailors in this city are in the Jing'an Temple Road and Nanjing Road area, followed by Sichuan Road, then Xiafei Road, and the worst is Dajin Street. Most can be bargained, especially in the Dajin Street area, where there is the most exaggeration. The asking price is 180 yuan per set, and the price can be bargained down to 120 yuan. The same is true for buying women's overcoats on Fourth Avenue. Those who are not good at bargaining are often cheated and suffer a lot. Smart customers should first look at the samples in the dismantled goods store, secretly remember the store number, telephone number, and the sample's item number. Make an appointment to measure the size and pay the deposit the next day. After leaving, call directly to inquire about the discount (because tailors have to exaggerate the discount and material cost). Those who want to buy cheap dig the materials themselves. (A set of ordinary suits usually requires 2.8 yards of material.) Then ask the tailor to do it. The workmanship (including all linings and buttons) is generally about 35 yuan per set. Those with exquisite and high-end products cost 50 to 60 yuan or more. Also, when customizing, you must ask for a wider head space. As for the trousers, the crotch should not be spliced. The rolled feet should be original pieces. The second layer should not be on the collar. The long gown should be straight and flat on the shoulders. The overcoat should be wide and not spliced. Otherwise, honest fools will not only be cheated and suffer losses, but also be called "Ah Mu Lin" behind their backs by the store.

### Special Police Regulations to Be Promulgated, Large-Scale Alert Implemented, Unprecedented Precautions Taken for September 18th, All Armed Personnel in Concessions Mobilized

According to a reporter from the local police authorities yesterday, Shanghai will see unprecedented large-scale alert measures this year on September 18th, the ninth anniversary of the so-called Pan Yang Incident, the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. The situation at that time is like comparing a small witch to a big witch compared to the alert seen since the 3rd of this month. According to senior officials of the police department, the police department will issue a special police regulation tomorrow, and a proclamation may be published in the newspaper shortly thereafter. Authoritative sources said that the alert at that time will be carried out by the British and French concession police authorities and the Japanese in full cooperation.

Additional Patrols Will Be Added Everywhere

It is said that the local authorities will not only cancel the leave of general staff at that time, but also request the dispatch of all foreign defense forces. At the same time, the International Settlement Volunteer Corps will also cooperate with the police department to implement patrols and searches. Currently, the barbed wire obstacles that have been erected on the main streets of the British and French concessions will continue to be maintained until after the September 18th anniversary. The number of patrolling officers at the junctions of the British and French concessions and the areas outside the concessions will be greatly increased. At the same time, armored vehicles will patrol the streets.

Japanese Begin Alert in Western Shanghai

As for Western Shanghai, the Japanese military police have apparently begun to prepare. Yesterday, in Yuyuan Road alone, Japanese military police were stationed in three places, stopping and searching vehicles. However, outside of Yuyuan Road, such as Bailinan Road and Wujiao Chang, no Japanese military police were seen. The barracks next to Zhaofeng Park Road, which were previously used by the British army, are still empty.

The French Concession's Lightning Blockade

Since the 3rd, the French Concession Police Department has closed all roads along Avenue Edward VII, except for Dong Xin Ju, Min Ti Ni Yin Road, Beile Road, Foch Road, Notre Dame Road, and Albert Road. The area has been quiet for many days, achieving considerable results. It is learned that the French authorities have now decided to adopt a lightning-style blockade, moving from the Bund to Foch Road at any time, opening and closing uncertainly, making it impossible to grasp, making it easier to search and arrest those who commit crimes. This lightning blockade strategy was implemented yesterday. Because Songshan Road on Avenue Edward VII, which had been closed for many days, was opened by the French authorities yesterday, dividing it into left and right passages for vehicles and pedestrians to enter and exit.

This is the first time in many months. This is all due to the special precautions taken by the police.

### Legal Matters of the French Municipal Council, Superintendent Dismissed and Leaves Shanghai

The superintendent of the French Concession Municipal Council, Mr. Bérigny, left Shanghai for the United States yesterday (the 11th), and will transfer to a ship back to France. Mr. Bérigny has resided in the Far East for thirteen years, and has not had time to return home in the past seven years. Recently, due to health and family matters, he submitted a request to the Municipal Council's board of directors to terminate his employment contract so that he could return home to recuperate. Mr. Bérigny's family has been greatly affected by the German-French war, so he also needs to handle matters personally. He plans to serve in France in the future and will not return to Shanghai. In recent years, the French Concession has become crowded and the environment is difficult. Fortunately, Mr. Bérigny has been good at governing, and everything has been orderly. The financial situation is also quite good. The board of directors recently awarded Mr. Bérigny a gold medal to reward him for his hard work. Mr. Bérigny is currently 57 years old. When the last European war broke out, he joined the artillery and participated in the war. He was also proficient in aviation and repeatedly led teams to participate in air battles, and was repeatedly commended by the military. After the war, he switched to the engineering and banking industries, holding important positions. On February 8, 1935, Mr. Bérigny was appointed Chief Engineer of the French Concession Municipal Council. On July 18, 1938, he was promoted to Superintendent of the Municipal Council. Last year, when France and Germany declared war, he and other French expatriates in Shanghai requested permission from their superiors to take leave and return home to participate in the war, but it was not approved.

### Jardine's Three Ships Complete Their Mission

It was previously reported that Jardine's ships, Ewo Sang, Tuck Wo Sang, and Teh Sang, which evacuated British troops from Shanghai, have arrived in Shanghai on schedule.

The Ewo Sang is scheduled to depart directly from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the 19th of this month. The Teh Sang is scheduled to load Saigon rice in Shanghai before the 25th of this month and is scheduled to return to Hong Kong from Saigon on the 18th. According to news from the shipping industry, the Hong Kong head office has telegraphed the Shanghai-based crew members of the Teh Sang to go to Hong Kong to assist in managing shipping affairs. It is also heard that a large quantity of貢米 (tribute rice) is being carried, in a considerable amount. The Tai Sang is scheduled to sail from Yantai and Tianjin to Shanghai on the 16th and is scheduled to sail to Hong Kong's coastal defense on the 18th.

### Suppressing the Black Market in Rice, Discussing a Long-Term Agreement

In addition to holding its seventh standing committee meeting yesterday to assess and set the maximum price for imported rice in the market, the Rice Price Evaluation Committee announced this morning that it will strictly enforce it in the market. In order to crack down on the black market and stabilize the rice market, it has also scheduled to hold its eighth standing committee meeting at 3:00 PM tomorrow at 15 Avenue Edward VII. At that time, the suppression of the black market will be discussed at length in order to stabilize the entire food supply in Shanghai. In order to continue to supervise the collective purchase of imported rice by the industry, the committee yesterday sent letters to French company D'Affoux, British company Jardine Matheson, and Swiss company Focar, requesting reports on the latest production prices of imported rice, so as to initiate another collective purchase of rice by the industry. It was learned from the rice industry yesterday that the source of domestic rice has not been controlled and there is no risk of interruption. It can still be transported continuously by land and water. Once a batch of rice is traded, each merchant can immediately obtain a "transport permit" from the local area. Once the "transport permit" is obtained, the rice can be shipped to Shanghai. Therefore, the rumors in the rice market are completely unfounded and unreliable. It is hoped that the authorities of the two concessions will facilitate the procedures for purchasing and transporting domestic rice to Shanghai, and crack down on price increases and resale in the market. Even if the source of imported rice is blocked, it will not matter.

### Courts in Both Concessions Receive Threatening Letters, Members of Both Courts Firm in Their Stance, Authorities Tighten Security to Prevent Accidents

The Shanghai First Special District Court has an international character and has been maintained safely and without incident through the efforts of various countries and the Public Works Department. Then, the assassination of Mr. Yu Hua, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the Second Branch of the High Court, and Mr. Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, occurred. The purpose is obviously to warn the authorities of the court to change their attitude through the fact of terror. However, the members of the Second Branch of the High Court and the First Special Court still maintain their previous attitude, unyielding. Then, a certain despicable act was discovered. Recently, all the judges of the First Special Court suddenly received the same type of letter, the language of which was obviously aimed at enticement and intimidation. It should be known that this kind of action is really not worth the laughter of those who know. The court authorities have their own firm stance, which will not be changed by any action. Currently, the court authorities and the Public Works Department are not only stepping up security but also strictly preventing the recurrence of unfortunate events. It is heard that the court in the French Concession has also received similar letters, limiting the time to declare their attitude. All members just laugh it off.

### Hongkou Japanese Business Public Buses Repeatedly Cause Accidents

Depressing the Exchange Rate of Legal Tender, Small Vendors Abnormally Operating

The North-China Daily News reports that since the Japanese business public buses began operating in the area north of the Suzhou Creek, for two years, due to the lack of experience of the drivers, accidents have repeatedly occurred, and pedestrians are often injured. It is estimated that various accidents occur almost every day. The most important of these is the peddling of Japanese military scrip by small vendors near each bus stop. From the Bund on Nanjing Road to the Waibaidu Bridge, the total number of men, women, old, and young peddlers reaches hundreds. Because the Hongkou Japanese business China Urban Public Bus Company refuses to accept legal tender at the stipulated exchange rate, this has led to the abnormal development of this exchange business. The company forcibly suppresses the exchange rate of legal tender, stipulating that two yuan of legal tender can be exchanged for one Japanese yen, while in reality, one Japanese yen is only equivalent to one yuan and three jiao of legal tender. The peddlers exchange one Japanese yen for one yuan and five jiao of legal tender. Currently, peddlers are arrested and detained by the police, and the banknotes they carry are confiscated and confiscated to curb this business of trying to make huge profits. However, after being released, they peddle again on various streets, trying to make profits.

### Promoting National Construction Through Thrift and Economy, Savings Group Established

Actively Proceeding Before Double Ten Festival, Simultaneously Held in All Sectors of Shanghai

In order to promote national thrift, encourage savings, and start national construction, the National Government promulgated the Regulations on Thrift and National Construction Savings and Implementation Rules. The Central Trust Bureau, the China Communications Farmers Bank, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau have all been approved to issue savings bonds. In order to promote rapid effectiveness, the Thrift and National Construction Savings Group has been established, limiting all provinces and cities across the country to complete the savings group before September 15, and actively launching the Thrift and National Construction Savings Movement during the period from September 18 to the Double Ten Festival. Moreover, thrift and national construction savings are an effective way to absorb idle funds and stabilize prices, and require each citizen to save a minimum of one to five yuan per month. Shanghai is actively promoting this in this special environment.

Methods for Purchasing and Redeeming Savings Bonds

Savings bonds are divided into two types, A and B. Type A savings bonds are purchased at face value, and interest and dividends are paid separately upon maturity. Type B savings bonds are calculated with interest at the time of purchase, and the bond amount is paid upon maturity. Types A and B savings bonds are divided into six types: five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, one hundred yuan, five hundred yuan, and one thousand yuan. Type A is a registered type and can be redeemed with signature, seal, or fingerprint. Type B is an unregistered type, and the bondholder can freely transfer or gift it. The redemption period for Type A is a minimum of six months and a maximum of ten years, calculated from the date of purchase. After six months, you can request to redeem part or all of the amount at any time. The redemption period for Type B is from one year to ten years. Savers cannot request redemption midway after purchasing the bond, and can only redeem the entire face value of the bond upon maturity.

Restrictions on the Use of Savings Funds

For the savings funds received from the issuance of savings bonds, except for retaining a portion as a redemption reserve for Type A savings bonds after six months, the remainder should be used in accordance with the scope of business specified in the Regulations on Thrift and National Construction Savings Funds, and reported to the Ministry of Finance for approval. The redemption reserve should not exceed 15% of the total amount of savings received in the previous six months. The areas of business for the use of savings funds include: (1) Investment in land reclamation, water conservancy construction, and agricultural development; (2) Investment in national defense production; (3) Investment in mining development; (4) Investment in transportation; (5) Other investments related to economic undertakings; (6) Investment in joint production and sales undertakings. However, each investment must be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval in advance. The issuing branch should handle the assets and liabilities of the savings bond issuance business with independent accounting.

National Government Guarantees the Safety of Principal and Interest

Regarding the postal remittance bureau and official and commercial banks collecting thrift and national construction savings, depositors can deposit in national currency of one yuan or more at any time. However, depositors must wait five years from the date of deposit before they can withdraw the principal. The receiving institution will give interest that is better than ordinary savings, and should maintain independent accounting, and not mix with the profits and losses of the bank's business. In addition to the receiving banks being directly responsible to the depositors, the government guarantees the safety of the principal and interest. If savings are deposited in foreign currency, the principal and interest will still be repaid in foreign currency upon maturity. Those who store in gold and silver will also follow the Ministry of Finance's method of exchanging legal tender and the method of exchanging legal tender for gold, and add handling fees to be calculated into the principal. When civil servants are required to pay a security deposit, savings deposit books can be used as a substitute.

### Wartime Monopoly of Daily Necessities Punished According to Military Law; Those Who Manipulate Monopolies in Concession Areas Will Still Be Allowed to Report and Prosecute According to Law After the War

The National Government authorities are extremely concerned about the people's livelihood during wartime, and are deeply concerned that wartime transportation is inconvenient and that unscrupulous merchants monopolize daily necessities. They have promulgated strict laws prohibiting hoarding and speculating, and have ordered various places to establish evaluation organizations to regulate them. It is learned that the Executive Yuan recently resolved that those who monopolize daily necessities during wartime for private gain, and are found to have factual evidence, will be charged with obstructing the war of resistance. This has been communicated to the whole country for compliance, and ordered transportation agencies to give priority to the transportation of daily necessities in the same way as military affairs. Local price stabilization committees should recruit as many local impartial people as possible to participate, and earnestly implement the price evaluation work, without making it a mere formality. In addition, those who rely on special environments in occupied areas or concession areas to manipulate daily necessities for self-enrichment will still be allowed to report and prosecute according to the law after the end of the war of resistance.

### After the Strike of the French Concession Night Soil Carriers, the Contracting Office Awaits Negotiation. Excrement is Temporarily Cleared by Garbage Collectors. The Workers Have Yet to Put Forward Any Demands.

Regarding the strike of the night soil cart pullers in the French Concession, there was no new development yesterday, nor was any news received regarding when work would resume. What is strange is that the workers have yet to put forward any demands, so the authorities also find it difficult to start mediation. However, cleanliness is a major political necessity. Since the night soil carriers went on strike, the excrement of over a million residents in the French Concession has suddenly become a problem. Residents, unable to dispose of it, mostly dump it arbitrarily in the alleys and roadside ditches, which not only affects the appearance of the city but also hinders sanitation. The French Concession Sanitation Department, in desperation, temporarily tasked the garbage collectors with the responsibility of clearing it, starting yesterday. Therefore, yesterday, large numbers of garbage collectors were seen cleaning up fecal filth on the streets and in the alleys.

The Contracting Office is Willing to Negotiate Peacefully

The strike of the night soil carriers in the French Concession has lasted for several days, and the citizens feel deeply distressed. Yesterday, reporters inquired from various sources. It is said that the Contracting Office is prepared to accept peaceful negotiations and has not suppressed the workers. However, the night soil workers have not sent anyone to negotiate, so it is impossible to approach them. According to investigations, the cause of this disturbance is that three or five night soil workers, relying on their power, exclusively operate private night soil sales, affecting the losses of the Contracting Office too much, and the office wanted to stop this. As a result, the majority of the workers were used by others, leading to the disturbance. The claim that six yuan per person was deducted from their wages in August is not true. Previously, a document from a certain organization was forwarded to the Contracting Office.

Demands Were Previously Made

The night soil workers put forward the following ten demands: (1) In case of wind and rain, if the lamp goes out, the old rule was a fine of 5 jiao, but now the patrol imposes a fine of 3 yuan. Please follow the previously agreed fine regulations. (2) Before August 13th, they left the factory at 2:00 AM and returned at 11:00 AM the next morning. Now, the new schedule is to leave the factory at 11:00 PM and return at 8:00 AM the next morning. This is when residents are still asleep and waiting to wake up, so work cannot be carried out on time. Please follow the previous regulations. (3) After 4:00 AM, they cannot directly reach the main roads and Avenue Joffre but must go around and rush across the side roads. Otherwise, they will be whipped and flogged if caught. The cleaning work takes several more hours. Please allow them to directly reach these two roads without obstruction. (4) During working hours, if workers are retrieving dirty objects in the alleys and the cart is parked on the side of the road with the cart door not closed, they will be fined 5 yuan. If they shout in the alleys and are heard by the police, they will be fined 9 yuan. They demand the cancellation of these regulations. (5) If vehicles or ironware are damaged, the employer should repair them. If woodwork is damaged, the workers will compensate according to the old regulations, but this does not apply to accidental damage or old and rotten items. (6) The employer should purchase raincoats, as workers' health is harmed by working in the rain. (7) The employer should establish a workers' hospital so that workers can avoid seeking medical treatment at their own expense when they are sick. (8) The employer should subsidize the labor union with 400 yuan per month for its operations. (9) The dismissal and appointment of workers must be approved by the labor union. (10) Increase the monthly salary by 5 yuan per person. (11) Request a salary increase for both the regular shift and the "wild chicken" shift. The Contracting Office replied on the next day (the 7th), roughly as follows: The Municipal Council can only make polite inquiries. Regarding the fines, they have already requested the Industry and Commerce Bureau to reduce them. In July, the total was over 800 yuan. In September, after requesting a reduction, it was only 9 yuan. Regarding wages, several yuan have already been added since the previous month. As for hospital and labor union subsidies, due to the nature of the contract, which changes with each annual bid, it is difficult to comply with these demands. Finally, they stated that they are willing to have both sides discuss the matter openly.

Considerable Revenue from Night Soil Carts

Unexpectedly, a riot occurred late the next night. It is said that in addition to injuring people, all night soil carts, telephones, etc., were destroyed. Recently, because the night soil workers have stopped negotiating, the situation has become deadlocked. According to investigations, there are a total of 483 night soil carts in the French Concession. After August 13th, about 430 carts are in use. All night soil workers are divided into regular shifts and "wild chicken" shifts, each accounting for half. The regular shifts receive a monthly salary of over ten yuan. The value of each "wild chicken" cart is calculated, and the average difference is negligible. As for the work areas of the night soil workers, they are regarded as assets and divided very clearly, and absolute chaos is not allowed. Therefore, the contractor changes every year with the bidding, while the night soil workers are inherited from generation to generation and are not easily changed. Although this kind of life is hard, the benefits are quite good. The average monthly income for one cart is about 200 yuan or more. Among them, some individuals own three to five carts and hire others to do the work, becoming wealthy. Therefore, according to established practice, night soil carts can be transferred to each other, and the market price for each cart is not easily obtained for less than 1,000 yuan. The contractor previously paid over 5,000 yuan per month, but since July of this year, it has been over 10,000 yuan. The income all depends on the night soil, and ships come to purchase it every day. The market price of night soil is determined by the number of ships. The lowest price is 6 jiao. On July 21st, it suddenly rose to 1.5 yuan. Now it has fallen back. In order to encourage the night soil workers, the Contracting Office added 5 fen of support for each cart when the price rose sharply. Recently, due to the price falling back, the support has been canceled. A small number of powerful figures among the night soil workers often use special forces to privately sell night soil. It is said that this is the cause of the recent disturbance. It is hoped that both sides will negotiate openly as soon as possible to avoid suffering for the citizens.

### National Construction Thrift Stamps - No News of Issue Yet

According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Directorate General of Posts responded to a request from the National Construction Thrift Savings Association to print National Construction Thrift Stamps, scheduled for issue on Double Ten Day. Since the above news was published, the public has flocked to the philately department of the Shanghai Postal Administration to inquire, showing the public's emphasis on National Construction Thrift Savings. However, the Shanghai Post Office has not received any telegram from the Directorate General regarding this matter, nor has it received news of the immediate issue of these stamps, making it difficult to give a definite answer to the public. Therefore, yesterday, a telegram was sent to the Kunming Directorate General of Posts to inquire about the truth, and a reply is expected within a few days.

They threatened and robbed the passenger of everything he had. A patrol officer from the Jiaxing Road Police Station discovered the incident and knew that the robbers were heading west on Hailar Road. He chased after them and only arrested one of them.

### The Jai Alai Stadium Suddenly Announces Closure; Rumors of Players' Strike Due to Unsuccessful Wage Increase Demands; Stadium Claims Closure Due to Player Illnesses

The Jai Alai Stadium on Avenue Paul Henry in this city is one of the most famous entertainment venues in this port. Its business is usually very prosperous. The stadium's competition times, except for the evening session at 8:00 PM from Monday to Friday, also include the afternoon session at 2:00 PM on Saturdays and Sundays. Last Sunday (the 8th), just after the afternoon session ended, a crowd of fans gathered, waiting for the evening session to begin, when the stadium authorities suddenly announced a temporary closure, leaving nearly a thousand fans at a loss. They all left in high spirits but returned disappointed. The stadium has been closed for four days now, and there is still no news of reopening. Yesterday, reporters went to inquire, and the stadium authorities stated that the reason for the closure was that the players suddenly fell ill after returning from their summer vacation in Japan, resulting in an insufficient number of players and an inability to start the competition. However, according to another source, the reason for the closure was actually that the stadium players, due to the recent increase in the cost of living, demanded a wage increase that was not granted, resulting in a strike.

### Tobacco Merchant Sued by Concubine on Charges of Assault and Defamation; Both Sides Argued in Court Yesterday; The Court Ordered a Postponement and Advised Both Parties to Reconcile

Zhao Zhongtao, a tobacco magnate, is 54 years old this year, from Nanchang, Jiangxi. He currently resides at No. 265, Rue Cardinal Fesch, French Concession, and possesses considerable wealth. He has six wives and concubines, and his family members reside in Hankou for most of the time. After the Shanghai battle began, Zhao took his wives and concubines to Shanghai to escape, and the main wife lived on Rue Cardinal Fesch. Zhao also rented houses at No. 6, Jing Village, Route Tenant de la Tour, No. 2, 3rd Floor, No. 341, Avenue Albert Premier, and Gao Pei Apartments on Avenue Joffre as residences for his concubines. He also owned a car with Concession Permit No. 11105 for transportation. A woman from Wuxi named Qian Jinxia, 31 years old this year, was seduced by Zhao in February 1927 at the New Hotel and the World Hotel in Hankou, where they lived together for about three months. Qian was only 18 years old at the time, and because she was pregnant, she had no choice but to marry Zhao as a concubine. She has since given birth to one son and one daughter, and the son is already 13 years old. Qian was very favored by Zhao in her youth, but in recent years, because her beauty has faded, Zhao has favored other concubines and often mistreated Qian. On the night of the 20th of last month, Zhao, at No. 3, 3rd Floor, No. 341, Avenue Albert Premier, where Zhao and Qian lived together, had a quarrel with a maid and took his anger out on Qian, beating her and forcing her to leave. Qian had no choice but to take her children and leave, temporarily residing with relatives and friends. Later, Zhao accused Qian in the newspapers of being restless and secretly stealing clothing. Therefore, Qian recently hired lawyers Wu Chuliang and Xie Jusan and filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Zhao of assault and defamation. According to the complaint, the court summoned the plaintiff Zhao Qian Jinxia and the defendant Zhao Zhongtao to the Second Criminal Court for trial yesterday by Judge Qiu Huanying. Both the plaintiff Zhao Qian Jinxia and the defendant Zhao Zhongtao arrived on time with their lawyers to await trial. First, the plaintiff Zhao Qian Jinxia stated the intention of her complaint, accusing the defendant Zhao Zhongtao of having no husband-and-wife affection for her, beating her and driving her out for no reason, and wantonly defaming her in the newspapers, forcing her to file a lawsuit. The court questioned the defendant Zhao Zhongtao.

According to Zhao's statement, on the 20th of last month, because he dismissed a maid, the maid gathered a crowd to make trouble for the defendant, saying that she was hired by the "madam" (referring to Qian Jinxia) and that the defendant could not dismiss her, so there was an argument, but he did not harm Qian. He now hopes that (referring to Qian) will bring the children back home to live together. The court verified the words and gently persuaded both parties to reconcile. Both parties agreed to go out and conduct a reconciliation. The court immediately ordered the case to be postponed to September 20 for further trial, hoping that both parties would reach a settlement and withdraw the lawsuit during the postponement. The court adjourned after the discussion.

Four robbers wearing suits first broke into the Defu (Tongji) Shop at No. 429 to rob it. Each held a wooden-shell gun and pistol, threatening to silence the people and forcing the cashier to hand over the keys. The robbers searched and robbed inside for a long time, taking away 22 gold bars, 1,800 US dollars, and 40,000 yuan in miscellaneous banknotes, for a total loss of over 230,000 yuan, which is a rare major robbery case. During the search, one employee attempted to resist slightly and was beaten by the robbers with fists and feet. Another person from the shop returned from outside, and one of the robbers guarding the door twisted his collar, imprisoned him in the room, and gave him two slaps. After about 20 minutes, the robbers carried the stolen goods and left, placing a hand grenade at the main entrance and fleeing on the elevator. Afterwards, the shop issued a loss report and reported it to the police for investigation. After receiving the report, the police authorities urgently dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. The hand grenade was taken into the police station.

### Dragon

The dragon as a creature has not been generally seen since the Three Dynasties. Qin Shi Huang was considered the Ancestral Dragon, Han Gaozu the Red Dragon, and Xiang Yu of Chu the White Dragon. Since then, it has been compared to emperors and kings, which was unheard of before. Liu Lei raised dragons and became an official because of it, indicating that before the Three Dynasties, dragons were also commonly raised animals. Before Liu Lei, there were those who used dragons to record official positions. After Liu Lei, there was Yu, who drove them away and released them in the marshes. Dragons are often said to have the power to bring rain, so events are attached to this, and it is often pointed out that the direct injection from the clouds above is dragons taking water. But since dragons cannot be seen, how can one believe that it is necessarily true? It is only because the Qian symbol in the Book of Changes has the phrase "clouds move and rain is distributed", and Confucius's commentary says "clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger", that people base their arguments on this and transmit rumors without change. Think about the dragon hiding in the swamp, riding the wind and clouds to rise up; even the dragon borrows the power of clouds and rain, so what is the point of saying that it waits to enter the sea to take water to bring rain to the sky? The sky is inherently clear, and dragons live in secret places. Some say they have dense scales and sharp claws, which is self-deception. The patterns of clouds, even as dark as ink, can be observed and pointed out. In addition, in the middle of a rain shower, the lightning shines, and is there not something that is dazzlingly golden and jade-like? But to vaguely consider it as dragon scales, then on a silent autumn night, there are fragments that pile up like scales, are they not also arrows? Westerners say that tornadoes pick up seawater, resembling dragons. Is it true or not? In short: there are no dragon-raising clans in the world, so why must people speak so definitely about it?

### Wartime London Miscellany

— Xiong Shiyi

(Sent by Airmail from London)

Before the outbreak of this war, many British people believed that one day, when the war broke out, London, Berlin, Paris, and other important cities of the warring countries would be devastated by air raids. Mr. H.G. Wells, the author of the famous "The Outline of History," predicted in another book, "The Shape of Things to Come," that within a few days of the outbreak of World War II, all European cities would be turned into ruins and rubble.

London is the world's largest city, with a population of more than eight million. To protect these people, the government has issued gas masks. London businesses have built air-raid shelters. On the day the Munich Agreement was signed, I was invited to give a lecture in Swansea, South Wales. I was almost late for the meeting because the station and the train were crowded with evacuated elementary school students from London. I had to wait for the second train.

That morning, the atmosphere was like that of Chinese New Year's Eve; everyone was extremely excited, trying to quickly finish their business, and people were rushing back and forth on the streets. When I arrived in Swansea, Mr. Chamberlain had obtained the news of peace from Hitler, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief. Although many people said that this was not real peace, the general public was happy with this policy and satisfied. The year 1938 finally avoided the calamity of war. When the issue of Danzig and the Polish Corridor arose last year, the public atmosphere became tense again. At that time, London's air defense was more prepared than before. A systematic network of anti-aircraft balloons provided further protection to the densely populated areas of Greater London. They looked like silver fish in the sky, set against the blue sky, shimmering in the sunlight, forming a beautiful artistic landscape. Another wartime scene that I found lovely was the streets of London during the blackout. Walking on the bustling streets of London in such darkness was a risky and refreshing experience. The scene of the prosperous streets gave a sense of peace and comfort, unlike the previous dazzling lights on all sides.

Apart from these appearances, wartime London was not much different from peacetime, except that you did not see as many children on the streets as before. Many schoolchildren had been evacuated to safer places. This plan can be said to be successful. The government only gave each family that housed these children a subsidy of ten shillings per week, and everyone had no complaints. Even wealthy single men or women volunteered to take in children; they were all willing to sacrifice their own happiness for the country.

Education cannot be stopped for even a day. Therefore, the school staff followed the children during the evacuation and moved to villages and rural areas. It was often not easy to find empty houses for the children to use as classrooms. Therefore, at the original school sites, the schools that moved from London borrowed the school sites and shared the lecture halls with the local schools. The time in the morning and evening was fully utilized, and classes were also held on Saturdays, so the time lost was made up for.

In short, the war did not change London much. All kinds of businesses were operating according to the old saying "business as usual." People have become accustomed to the war. Although the news is tense, people's minds are always calm. No matter how the situation is, they believe that they will achieve final victory.

Family

### Mother

— Yu Ge

I haven't seen my mother for two years!

In the autumn of the year before last, because of the unrest in the countryside, she wanted me to come to Shanghai to take refuge, but she herself refused to come because there were many things at home that she had to take care of herself, so we were separated! Before parting, she repeatedly told me: take care of your health, be careful with hot and cold food. But since I came to Shanghai, that hateful illness seems to deliberately make things difficult for me! In the loneliness of illness, it is easy to make me think of my mother. If she were still by my side, how comfortable it would be! At the same time, I have to think of her aging years, which makes me often miss her health.

Some time ago, my father had no business for a long time, and there was no savings at home. The pressure of life made her work hard. My older brother and sister were all raised by my mother alone, which caused her strong body to become weak, and her plump face gradually withered! She herself often said: I am old! Indeed, my mother seems particularly older than most people. The wrinkled forehead, the pointed small mouth, and the lifeless eyes, all these imprints of life can be found on her.

She regards these as her destiny!

In recent years, although my family situation has been much better than before! But my father married another woman into the family, which undoubtedly cut a painful wound in her heart.

Although she is a fatalist, how can she not be angry when so many facts are placed before her eyes and irritate her?

She often said to me: Ge! When you grow up in the future, you must win some respect for me! Even if I die underground, I will smile!

But what can I win some respect for? I really have no nostalgia for this collapsing feudal family! Although my mother always loves me and cares about me!

I have prepared to dedicate everything I have to my motherland!

What I can comfort you with is only that little bit, Mother! Smile!

Here I wish you good health!

Education

### The Atmosphere of Reading

— Lin Xiang

I don't know about the situation in other professional circles, but the atmosphere of reading in our higher education institutions is really not strong. Everyone's interest seems to be focused on grades. This view is wrong. However, it is the education system that fosters this topsy-turvy view.

I believe that reading is for practical use, so the more the better. If you only know how to recite textbooks and lecture notes and don't know how to do extensive reading and further research, to be honest, this kind of person will not have any future.

Perhaps there is a lack of professors in Shanghai universities who are willing to sincerely guide students. However, I will say a famous saying: what is important now is to strive for independence, not to rely on others. We can also start research and discuss together. Although it is an isolated island, in terms of material conditions, Shanghai is still better than other parts of the country. I believe that if we can't produce any results, it would be too much to say.

Therefore, I believe that it is necessary to cultivate an atmosphere of reading in Shanghai universities. This is not rote learning, but active reading. It is not reading for grades, but really reading something. Books are something you read yourself. Although this is a cliché, can you say it's wrong? The idea of deceiving oneself and others with grade-ism should be cleared up.

It's time for school to start again. I respectfully offer this opinion to the students in Shanghai. I also hope that starting from this semester, an atmosphere of reading will permeate Shanghai universities, and a free research movement will be launched.

(I also hope that the university authorities can pay attention to this issue and resolutely support it.)

### Insect Life

— Qian

The speed at which silkworms spin silk is about six inches per minute on average. It takes about three days to form a cocoon, and the silk that we reel, excluding the tangled silk, can yield about 1,000 feet of pure silk per cocoon.

Each pound of honey collected by a pair of bees requires as many as 40,000 to 50,000 round trips. If the average distance of each trip is one to one and a half miles, then the distance required for each bee to collect one pound of honey is at least two circumferences of the Earth.

If a female aphid is allowed to reproduce parthenogenetically for one year, the length of its offspring connected end to end can circle the Earth's surface.

Most insects can move objects that are 10 to 20 times heavier than themselves. A housefly can drag a matchstick, which is equivalent to a human being able to move a log that is 35 feet high and has a diameter equal to the length of the human body.

### Destiny

— Yong

Tyne Edwards tells us: "Thought causes purpose; purpose causes action; action creates habit; habit fixes character; and character determines our destiny."

From this, we can know that destiny is created by our thoughts, purposes, actions, habits, and character. Friends! From today onwards, stop believing that destiny is predestined by heaven. As long as we pay attention to our thoughts, purposes, actions, habits, and character, we will naturally grasp our destiny.

The Hawthorne Case

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 7 "Take Him Away"

Next to his sofa was a Western-style low tea table. On the tea table, besides that full cup of tea that would not touch his lips, was an ashtray containing a matchbox. I leaned over, took out a match, and vigorously struck the match on the side of the matchbox. I lit it and brought it to my cigarette, deliberately blowing out the match. So I re-struck the second match. Lu Jiansheng glanced at me when I struck the first match. When I struck the second match, his gaze returned to Hawthorne's face, preparing to continue the conversation. Taking him by surprise, I took the teacup and tilted it towards his leather shoes, casually dropping the cup on the floor, pretending to spill it unintentionally. With a bang, Ni Jinshou and Lu Jiansheng stood up. Lu Jiansheng hurriedly stepped forward with his two tea-soaked feet, moving away from the spilled tea.

I hurriedly smiled and said, "I'm very sorry."

Lu Jiansheng did not show any anger, and said humbly, "It's nothing." He walked to the other sofa on the other side of the tea table and sat down. But his leather shoes had left a very clear print on the floor.

At this time, Hawthorne continued to ask: "Okay, now you continue. After she followed you, she lived in that house on Qingpu Road. Until now, she no longer works as a dance hostess. Is that right?"

Lu Jiansheng said: "Yes, but although she doesn't work as a dancer, she doesn't completely disappear from the dance hall. She often accompanies me to the dance hall."

I took advantage of the opportunity when they were answering, turned my body around, quietly took out a soft ruler, walked to the footprint left by Lu Jiansheng, squatted down, and pretended to tie my shoelaces. I measured the shoeprint with the tape measure, and it was exactly 11.6 inches, the same as the A print we found at the door of the morgue!

Hawthorne asked again, "So, of course the expenses are provided by you. About how much do you provide her each month?"

Lu Jiansheng said, "Yes. I don't have an exact number, probably a few hundred dollars, at most less than a thousand."

Hawthorne turned around and looked at me. I had already taken out a small piece of paper and wrote the words "11.6 inches, round head, same as A print" in pencil. As I walked past him, I quietly handed it to him. (104)

Showbiz

### Hollywood's Dreamers

— Hua Zhi

People who indulge in fantasy are not of much value in general, but they often have considerable achievements in the creation of film art. Hollywood has always had a "Fantasy Club," recruiting resourceful screenwriters, producers, big directors, etc., to engage in imaginative research to add plots to films. Since its establishment, it has come up with many things.

The members of the Fantasy Club all possess broad knowledge and experience. On the one hand, they must create unheard-of and unseen things, and on the other hand, they must make these things close to human feelings, so as not to violate the bans of the authorities or lose the feeling of personal observation. These two elements are very contradictory, and a little carelessness will lead to "infantile paralysis" and fruitless labor. Therefore, the members of the department go through meticulous discussions on a fantasy situation to make it scientific before it is possible. In the past, famous blockbusters of various film companies, such as "King Kong" and "The New World After Fifty Years," were all masterpieces of dreamers. Other films such as Karloff's "Zombie" and Weissmuller's "Tarzan, the Ape Man" also benefited from their guidance.

Following the decline of the period of monster and beast films, the dreamers have been almost idle for years, but recently there has been a resurgence. For example, MGM has decided to adopt the ideal of the department and produce "Descendants," which tells the love story of a pair of men and women on Earth before there were humans, starring the pillar Nauma Shearer. Because Nauma Shearer's performance in a fantasy film is a first, all the dreamers are doubly active in order to achieve perfection.

### New Couplets for Mid-Autumn Festival Film Titles

— A Yin

Recently, as the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, various cinemas have been showing new films one after another to decorate the occasion. During my brothers' and sisters' spare time from school, we jokingly used the titles of the films recently shown in the newspapers by various cinemas to make couplets, which we found quite interesting. I recorded them to elicit a smile:

Thirteen Couplets with Four Characters Each

(1) Golden Bridge Chick Phoenix  Iron Man Petite Girl

(2) Queen of Song of a Generation  Teacher Model for All Generations

(3) Heaven and Earth  Underwater Electric Kingdom

(4) Merry Widow  Dragon and Phoenix New Match

(5) Holy Knight Returns  Outlaw's Last Road

(6) Country Girl  Foolish Soldier

(7) Xiaoxiang Autumn Rain  Frontier Spring Dawn

(8) Su San's Amorous History  Jigong Living Buddha

(9) Tarzan Gets Treasure  Love Saint Dies for the Country

(10) Queen of the Beast Kingdom  Hero of Troubled Times

(11) Yin Zhen Spring and Autumn  Xuan Palace Amorous History

(12) Queen for One Night  Three Errors Good Time

(13) Strange Case of Treasure Island  Spring Colors of the Austrian Palace

Four Couplets with Three Characters Each

(1) Mirror of Retribution  Night Bright Pearl

(2) Little Angel  Female Emperor

(3) Li Xiangjun  Wen Suochen

(4) Pipa Record  Biography of Martyrs

In addition, there are only two films with two-character titles, "Rain Comes" and "Yue Fei." If the character "Yue" is interpreted as the "Yue" of "mountains," it can also be勉强be matched. As for film titles with five characters, such as "The Earl of Chicago," "The Adventures of Pinocchio," "Bright Moon Shines on Three Stars," "Qianlong Travels to Jiangnan," and "Burning the Red Lotus Temple," it is difficult to quickly tie them into pairs, so I have to stop writing.

### Sun Jinglu Will Star in "Thunderstorm"

— A Han

When we discover a new person with true talent suddenly rising, it is as comforting as a spring flowing out of the barren desert. Sun Jinglu's reputation in the film and drama circles is currently in this situation.

One early autumn evening, the sky was sparkling with crescent moons and stars. On this poetic evening, I began a conversation with Miss Sun Jinglu, as if reliving her life.

Although she speaks fluent Mandarin, she is actually from Pudong, Shanghai. However, she went to Beiping with her family when she was young, so both her speech and body have a strong northern tone.

Later, at the age of twelve, she went to Yixun Girls' Middle School in Hankou. After about three years of studying, the all-out war of resistance broke out, and a passionate emotion surged in her girlish heart. She felt that all nationals should do their best to serve the country. At the same time, she felt a great interest in drama, thinking it was quite interesting cultural work. Therefore, when the China Travel Troupe went to Hankou to perform, she resolutely joined.

Because of her young age, she only played roles such as Sifeng in "Thunderstorm" and the little nun in "Ah Q," to cater to her little girl style.

At the end of last year, the China Travel Troupe reopened in Shanghai. Sun Jinglu had reached a mature age for a girl, and because of her many years of drama experience, her consummate acting skills were generally recognized as the second person after Tang Ruoqing. Starring in "New Merlot Fragrance," "Ah Q," "Two Worlds," "Heavenly Net and Earthly Weft," and "Wilderness," each drama was indeed more progressive than the last.

This time, the China Travel Troupe is preparing to present the world's stage play "Thunderstorm" before the Mid-Autumn Festival, and she has been invited to star in the role of the heroine Kataryn. The success of the future performance can be predicted.

As for her film life, she had a supporting role in Cai Chusheng's "Isolated Island Paradise" in Hong Kong. Last year, Xinhua filmed "Xi Shi," and she was also invited by Zhang Shankun to play a role, but she did not sign a contract at the time. This time, she starred as A Jin in Jin Xing's "The Family of Qinhuai," and although she has only filmed six scenes, Zhang Shichuan already believes that the results are very satisfactory. Especially her brisk and consummate Mandarin is unparalleled in the current film industry, which proves the brilliance of her talent.

### The Rise of Fashion Films

— Ling Bai

The trend of folk tale films has passed, and everyone is now leaning towards the production of fashion films. Of course, this is a good phenomenon. Now, Guohua is filming "Li Amao and the Zombie," starring You Guangzhao and Gong Jianong. Jin Xing Company is also starting to film "The Family of Qinhuai," and has invited stage actors Sun Jinglu, Xia Xia, Murong Wan'er, etc. to star, which should win new evaluations in the future.

When Yihua invited Li Qinian, it was agreed to produce two films, one ancient costume and one fashion. As a result, they shot "The Female Emperor" and "Liang Hongyu," one ancient costume film, at the same time. However, the fashion film is still to be produced. The big one currently scheduled to be filmed is "New Camille." However, this film was previously filmed by Guangming Company, starring Yuan Meiyun, Liu Qiong, and Ying Yinzhong, so whether it will be realized is still unpredictable.

As for Guolian, in addition to "Country Girl," directed by Wang Yin and starring Yuan Meiyun, which is about to be completed and will be the opening film for the Guolian Grand Theater, "The True Story of Ah Q" is also in preparation. At the same time, the Guolian authorities are also preparing to fully produce two fashion films, one is "Golden Jade Hall" and the other is "Beautiful Island." It is planned to invite Chen Yunshang to star in "Golden Jade Hall," and to fully develop her lively and brisk style in the script, unlike the youthful woman type character in the initial "Cloud Dress Fairy." "Beautiful Island" is planned to invite Chen Yanyan to star. In this way, Guolian's three major female stars (Gu Lan Jun has already been self-funding the production of the fashion film "Money and Love.") will all shed their ancient costumes, which is a new message worth reporting to readers.

### A Scene from Xinhua's Fashion Film "Country Girl"
