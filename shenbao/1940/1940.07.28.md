The Chinese army waited until the Japanese approached, then met them head-on with concentrated firepower, killing many Japanese soldiers. The Chinese forces then lured the Japanese into favorable terrain for an ambush. After fierce fighting until 3:00 PM, both groups of Japanese soldiers were unable to withstand the attack, leaving behind hundreds of corpses and retreating to their ships to escape.

### Ambassador to France Gu Weijun Willing to Discuss Peace China Now Adopts an Offensive Posture Against Japan Will Never End the War Unless Japan Abandons Aggression Hopes the United States Will Ban Raw Materials and Military Supplies to Japan

Vichy: Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun told a United Press reporter yesterday that as a result of the closure of the Burma Road and the Vietnamese Railway, China is now using 20,000 camels to transport food and military supplies from the Soviet Union through Turkestan to China. Dr. Gu had previously been on a mission to Lisbon for the government and arrived here yesterday. Dr. Gu stated that China has no intention of surrendering to Japan and is now adopting an offensive posture against Japan. China will never end the war for independence until Japan abandons its policy of aggression. The British government's closure of the Burma Road is indeed a severe blow to China, but China will not surrender because of it. Fortunately, with the foresight of Chairman Chiang, China now has sufficient war materials to maintain a strong international situation that is more favorable to China. The development of military industries in the interior of China is extremely rapid. The ammunition and some of the light weapons used by the army are now made in China. The morale of the Chinese army has recently been greatly boosted. The recent courageous defense of Hangzhou Bay is sufficient proof. The British government has already made concessions to Japan, but British politicians are still making deceptive statements in repeated declarations, saying that Britain is standing on the principles of law and order and that Britain is fighting not only for its own security but also for the freedom of other countries. It should be known that the closure of the Burma Road has caused great disappointment to all those who sympathize with Britain's actions in Europe, because there is no crime of aggression in the world more obvious than Japan's aggression against China. The standards of justice and righteousness in Europe are by no means different from the standards of justice and righteousness in Asia; there are absolutely no two standards. We must not regard the Suez Canal as the boundary dividing the moral standards of two kinds of international life, Europe and Asia. Britain's capitulation to Japan on the issue of transporting military supplies to China via Burma may temporarily alleviate Britain's difficulties in the Far East, but this situation cannot last long. Japanese soldiers will certainly not abandon their southward policy simply because Britain has surrendered. If Britain cannot win in Europe, what is the point of making concessions to Japan on important issues? Japan is now planning to take advantage of Britain's failure to seize the land of the broken Far Eastern empire. If Britain wins the European war, even if it is attacked by Japan (the Japanese must have hesitated for a long time before taking this action), it will not be difficult for Britain to rebuild its position in the Far East. China will still completely rely on the United States, because the United States' position has never wavered and it is rich in moral and material resources. China understands and respects the desire of the American people not to participate in the European and Asian wars, so China does not hope that the United States will send troops to maintain its integrity. It is hoped that the United States will ban the transportation of military supplies and key raw materials to Japan, because if Japan does not have the supply of these military supplies and raw materials, it will inevitably abandon its attempt to conquer China. The least the United States can do is to ban the export of oil and iron to Japan. This action by the United States will only sacrifice very meager interests, but it can greatly restrict Japan and greatly benefit China's struggle for independence.

Not only should the concept of foreign policy be changed, but the senior officials in charge of diplomacy should also be changed.

Editorial

### The Implementation of the United States' Firm Policy

U.S. President Roosevelt announced the day before yesterday that four types of military oil and iron must be exported only after a special permit is issued by the State Department; at the same time, the Maritime Commission is not allowed to allow U.S. oil tankers to join the Japanese route. American commentators have said that the three Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy will be most affected, or that the United States has now begun to wield its economic weapons, or that the United States has now extended its economic fist to Japan. The Japanese side also admitted that it would be greatly affected and regarded this as a very important matter for Japan. What day was the day before yesterday? July 25th, exactly the first anniversary of the United States' announcement of the termination of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, and exactly half a year from the actual expiration of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty. Following this time, we can see how rhythmic the steps of the United States' Far East policy are!

The strength of the United States' Far East policy lies in its firm grip, and its weakness lies in its slow application. Those around the world who benefit from the U.S. Far East policy may be worried and disappointed due to its slowness, while those who are restrained by it may despise its slowness and hope to get lucky; these are all failures to observe the firmness of its policy, all mistakes. Originally, the Far East dispute was one part of the Pacific problem. The total national strength of the United States in the Pacific is indeed superior to any other country; with the current national strength of the United States, the expansion of a huge navy is something that no other country can catch up with; given more time, after the United States has achieved tangible results from the Pan-American Conference, its power will certainly be unmatched, and its policy will inevitably be the decisive factor in everything. This is nothing else. A policy based on fairness and freedom is inherently destined to succeed in the end, and the strength of the United States is sufficient to implement its policy.

The policy of the United States is like that, and Japan's aggression is like this. The depth and sharpness of the opposition between them is self-evident. What is not yet clear is that it cannot be regarded as a short-term confrontation. Tracing back to the abandonment of the commercial treaty last year, to the current prohibition of the export of four types of military oil and iron, this method is the gradual advancement of the United States in implementing its policy, and this nature is the gradual entry of the United States in implementing its policy into a stage where it is bound to be effective. Therefore, even in the near future, what kind of noteworthy response will be triggered is very possible. However, the long night will eventually dawn, so it is not permissible to expect it too quickly. Japan obtains 90 percent of the scrap iron needed for combat from the United States, and the gasoline purchased from the United States is worth about US$10 million per year. Various precision oils used for aviation motors must be obtained from the United States: now that the United States has banned exports, causing Japan to suffer extremely great impact, this is something that the Japanese side also acknowledges and does not deny. From then on, Japan will inevitably have a day when its armaments cannot be replenished, and the Japanese air force will inevitably have a day when it cannot take off; that is to say, Japan will eventually be restrained by the economic sanctions under the United States' Far East policy and will no longer be able to maintain its aggression. However, as of now, how much iron does Japan have in stock, and how much oil does it have in stock? From today until the day when the iron and oil are exhausted, how much iron and oil can be supplemented at home and abroad? Although it is said that the quantity is bound to be limited, it cannot be estimated too low. Therefore, it is a natural observation that Japan can still maintain its military aggression for a considerable period of time after the United States bans the export of oil and iron. What cannot be known is whether Japan will wait until its resources are exhausted, until the last drop of blood and the last inch of iron, before abandoning its aggression? Or will it still struggle in various ways, regardless of what new situation it will create? Or will it wake up in time and change its course? These three possibilities are for Japan to choose for itself; if it does not choose for itself, then between the United States' firm policy and China's determination to resist, there will naturally be a last resort that Japan will have to take. Shinzo Abe's recent re-election as prime minister shows a certain self-restraint, and the fragments of his political views that have been published leave room for maneuver. However, in our observation, it is easy for the cabinet to leave room for maneuver in its policies, but it is only for the cabinet to consider itself; it is difficult for the country to plan for its ability to release and recover, and this is really related to the country's destiny. Since Japan's invasion of China, its concerns about the United States have deepened day by day; at first, it regarded the interests of the United States as nothing and ignored the protests made by the United States at the end of 1938; after the United States announced the abandonment of the commercial treaty, it still believed that it could make the United States change its attitude and hoped to renew the commercial treaty; when U.S. Ambassador Grew gave sincere advice in a speech, the commercial treaty was put into effect shortly afterward, and he realized the firmness of the U.S. policy; however, a few days ago, he still hoped that the United States would not take new actions, thinking that he could do whatever he wanted before the U.S. presidential election; we have already discussed this before, knowing that it is not so, and now it has actually implemented the ban on oil and iron. The United States is slow, but Japan does not know how to make good use of the opportunity given by the delay; this is not the foolishness of the Japanese, but the power and courage of those in power cannot control the country's major plans, so they clearly know that they must change course and abandon aggression, but they still hesitate and do not know what to do; sitting and waiting in this way, they will inevitably be restrained by the firm policy of the United States one day and will not be able to maintain their dignity. This is also very regrettable.

### Reuters Correspondent in Tokyo, Cox, Arrested in Japan Rumor Has It Arrest Was for "Military Reasons" British Embassy Is Negotiating

Local news: Last night, people in the local press were eagerly awaiting news from Tokyo to explain the arrest of Cox, Reuters correspondent in Tokyo. According to private news from Shanghai, Cox was arrested yesterday by the Japanese military police for allegedly violating one of Japan's many military regulations. Local rumors say Cox is being held at the Tokyo Military Police Headquarters for "military reasons." The British Embassy is currently conducting an investigation. Cox's arrest is quite puzzling, and no details have been released from Tokyo. The government has also not issued any announcements. It is said that the Japanese authorities have banned newspapers from publishing anything about this matter. As far as we know here, no news agency in Tokyo has been able to obtain any detailed information. No direct news has come from Tokyo so far. It is expected that the Japanese authorities in Tokyo will issue an official announcement tonight. People in the local press all know that Cox is a senior correspondent, so they regard the news of his misunderstanding with the Japanese military police as a very big concern. Because of Cox's personality, he is quiet and cautious in his actions. His writings have always adopted a prudent and conservative policy, especially when it comes to political events that the Japanese are currently sensitive to. Although Cox has always been known for being frank and daring to speak out, he is by no means an imprudent news correspondent who sometimes uses sensational words carelessly. Cox has been in his current position in Japan for six years and knows the Japanese very well. As soon as many reporters in Shanghai received news of Cox's detention, the illusion of another Young case could not help but appear in their minds. Although the crime Cox is accused of is still unknown, people here all believe that it is related to his journalistic work, or that Cox had written something that the Japanese authorities considered defamatory or unfriendly. Some people also believe that Cox's arrest has nothing to do with his journalistic activities. Cox has a wide range of social connections in Shanghai and has joined the Shanghai Club and the Race Club as a member. He is one of the senior foreign correspondents in Tokyo. Since 1934, he has served as the chief Reuters correspondent in Japan. After joining Reuters in London in 1901, he was transferred to Mumbai for five years. In 1909, he was promoted to manager of Reuters in Columbus. In 1912, he was transferred to manager of Reuters in Shanghai. He resigned in 1918. From 1922 to 1925, he served as manager of Reuters in Hong Kong. In 1930, he came to Shanghai again and served as manager of Reuters' Far East News Department. He was transferred to his current position in 1934. Cox is currently 55 years old and was born in Rightwell, Kent, England. (Reuters)

Local news: It is reported that when British Ambassador to Japan Craig met with Japan's new Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke this afternoon, he discussed the detention of Reuters correspondent in Tokyo Cox, but the announcement issued by the Japanese Foreign Ministry regarding this meeting did not mention this matter at all. According to private news, Cox was arrested at 8:00 AM yesterday at his summer resort on the coast 30 miles outside of Tokyo. (Reuters)

### Sichuan and Hunan Provinces Expect Good Harvests

Chongqing: It is appropriately declared here from relevant sources that the rice and wheat harvest in the non-occupied areas this year is expected to be "very satisfactory," so there is no fear of food shortage. The Sichuan Province has recently had several days of sweet rain. Before the rain, agricultural experts estimated that the autumn harvest this year would be no more than 30 percent at most. Now that it has rained heavily for several days in a row, this year's harvest should be around 70 percent, which is roughly the same as last year. As for the so-called 100 percent harvest, it is purely a theory, and in fact it has never been achieved. In addition to Sichuan, there is no worry about poor harvests in other provinces. For example, Yunnan and Guizhou, which often have poor harvests, are also expected to have good harvests this year. The harvests in Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi are expected to be good. Even the northwest provinces are said to be doing well. Therefore, people are generally celebrating, thinking that this phenomenon is tantamount to a major victory in the military.

### North China Foreign Commerce Set to Stagnate

Peiping - Due to the Japanese issuance of new import and export regulations, foreign commerce in North China is poised to stagnate. There is widespread fear that the commercial fate of American, British, and other foreign businesses in North China will mirror that of the once-prosperous foreign trade in "Manchuria." American and other import/export merchants in this area and in Tianjin are viewing this situation with grave concern and holding little hope for the future. There is a consensus that without government intervention, foreign commerce in this area under the control of the Japanese-led "North China Political Affairs Commission" will inevitably decline. The foreign chambers of commerce in Tianjin and Peiping are currently striving to find a way out of this rapidly deteriorating situation. Although the aforementioned new import and export regulations were promulgated a month ago, the merchants and bankers affected by them still find the interpretation of these regulations difficult to understand. Even the staff of the Joint Reserve Bank, currently tasked with implementing these new regulations, appear to have only a vague understanding when explaining the procedures for obtaining special permits to merchants. The readily apparent consequence is the complete stagnation of foreign commerce. The key points of the new regulations are as follows: (1) Any foreign goods intended for import from countries other than Japan and "Manchukuo" must first obtain a special permit from the Joint Reserve Bank. However, imports of flour, wheat, rice, corn, sorghum, and brown rice are exempt from the special permit requirement. (2) The Joint Reserve Bank will not provide foreign exchange without the aforementioned permits. (3) Those seeking foreign exchange for importing foodstuffs should apply to the Joint Reserve Bank and obtain permission to purchase foreign exchange issued by approved banks. (United Press, 27th)

### Evacuation of Women and Children from Hong Kong - Heavily Criticized

Manila - According to news received here from Hong Kong, members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council have expressed strong dissatisfaction with the evacuation of women and children from Hong Kong, demanding that the Hong Kong government conduct an investigation and asserting that since the British government ordered the evacuation, it should bear all expenses. One councilor stated that forcing women to leave the territory is contrary to the principles for which we are fighting for freedom and justice, and that certain major evacuation costs appear to be taken from Hong Kong taxpayers. The evacuation also apparently distinguishes between races, which is shameful. A councilor stated that this measure by the government has lost the trust of society. It is reported that Hong Kong society is greatly angered by the forced evacuation. (Haitong Telegraph, 27th)

Hong Kong - People in Hong Kong are now preparing a petition demanding that the Governor of Hong Kong abolish the evacuation plan and allow the wives of Hong Kong citizens who wish to return to Hong Kong to do so. The petition will be signed by the public today. After the petition is signed, it will be submitted to the Governor by Mr. Pollock, a non-official member of the Legislative Council. The petition asserts that the evacuation is disrupting people's livelihoods and that those who are evacuated are experiencing various hardships. (United Press, 27th)

Hong Kong - The Legislative Council held a meeting on Thursday and resolved that citizens should petition the government to cancel the plan to evacuate women and children and allow those who have been evacuated to return to Hong Kong. Those who agree with this proposal can sign their names at various newspaper offices in the city today. The petition will be submitted to the government next Monday by Sir Pollock, the oldest of the non-official members of the Legislative Council. (Reuters, 27th)

### US Controls Oil and Iron Exports - Effective August 1st - Horiuchi Inquires of Welles - Formal Report Submitted to Japanese Foreign Ministry

Washington - Roosevelt yesterday explained that the order he issued on Thursday placing American oil and scrap iron under a licensing system would henceforth include petroleum products, tetraethyl lead, iron, steel, and scrap iron under export control. The explanation of prohibited items is as follows: 1. Aviation motor oil, all high-grade gasoline, light hydrocarbon mixtures, and any products that, after commercial refining, can produce 3% or more gasoline or light hydrocarbon mixtures are included. 2. Aviation lubricating oil. 3. Tetraethyl lead, all pure tetraethyl lead and dialkyl lead oils are included. 4. Iron, steel, and scrap iron, that is, heavy, high-melting-point scrap iron. The order states that the export licensing system announced on July 2nd of last year now applies to aviation motor fuel, tetraethyl lead, and aviation lubricating oil. President Roosevelt said that this licensing system will take effect on August 1st and that this measure is intended for the benefit of national defense. Officials said that this measure is intended to conserve American raw materials to facilitate self-defense programs. The countries most affected by this order will be Japan, Germany, and Italy, as this measure is tantamount to an embargo on them. Japan is the leading purchaser of American scrap iron and purchases large quantities of American petroleum products from the US annually. (United Press, 27th)

Washington - President Roosevelt issued a special order yesterday stating that the new regulations for oil export controls are limited to aviation gasoline, lubricating oil, and tetraethyl oil. It was previously known that the last type of oil could be used to refine all petroleum products. Regarding the export permit method for scrap iron, it is said that it is currently limited to number one melting block iron. Even with this restriction, Japan will still be able to obtain large amounts of crude oil, but its air force may feel the pain of lacking high-octane gasoline. (Telegraph, 27th)

Washington - Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horiuchi visited Acting Secretary of State Welles, reportedly discussing the U.S. control of oil and scrap iron exports. When President Roosevelt received reporters yesterday, he stated that this was not a ban but only a matter of national defense. (Reuters, 27th)

Tokyo - The Japanese Foreign Ministry received an official report yesterday from its ambassador to the United States regarding the U.S. government's embargo on oil and iron. It is expected that the main purpose of this action is to deal with Germany and Italy, but Japan will also be affected. As for Britain, it can still obtain supplies of American oil and iron from Canada. (Haitong Telegraph, 27th)

Embargo Weakens Japan's War-Making Ability - Reveals a New Spirit of Diplomatic Policy

New York - American radio commentators are very interested in the measure requiring export licenses for American oil and scrap iron. It is believed that this is actually a step to prohibit these exports to Japan and Spain. The famous commentator Swine said that the President's action avoided direct hostility towards Japan, thereby eliminating the need for Japan to try to save face, but the effect is the same, as this ban weakens Japan's war-making power. This action is not direct aid to China but represents a new spirit in American foreign policy. Hitler's reliance on mixed oil supplies cannot solve his oil supply problems. Germany does not have enough oil for a long-term war, and its oil reserves will gradually dry up. Another commentator said that the American ban is clear evidence of the cooperation between the US and Britain in blockading the Axis powers. The New York Bulletin reported that Germany and Japan would not welcome this action by the United States but still do not have the ability to retaliate. The listing of oil and scrap iron as prohibited items, along with the blocking of two American oil tankers from sailing to Spain, has revealed that democratic countries can act with a realistic spirit to protect all their interests in the world. (Reuters, 27th)

New York - Since the U.S. abolished the trade treaty on July 26th of last year, the U.S. has inflicted its most significant economic blow on Japan, as scrap iron and iron blocks are under export controls. Production organizations throughout Japan are worried about the impact of this statement, as they will find it difficult to satisfy the insatiable desires of the Japanese military for all the scrap iron and scrap steel. Japan has been apprehensive for months about the U.S. embargo, as these important items are very important for supporting the war against China. All sectors in Japan acknowledge that the U.S. needs to conserve its resources in the current crisis but also feel that the U.S. action is intended to supply more raw materials to Britain and for the U.S.'s own defense needs. It is reported that Japan recently seized 300,000 tons of scrap iron as a blitz tactic in anticipation of the embargo. Last year, Japan took more than half of the total raw materials of scrap iron and scrap steel from the United States, which caused prices to soar and made American industry uneasy. Prices of all items in the U.S. are rising, and there are 14 countries supplying scrap iron to Japan, with the United States supplying nearly 90% of the total, making the situation even more serious. With the outbreak of the European war, ships from Australia, all British territories in the South Pacific, Canada, and India to Japan were interrupted, so Japan had no choice but to rely on supplies from the United States. Authoritative sources say that Japan has not been able to find iron ore and raw materials in China, and neither Japan nor Manchuria has top quality products. It is reported that Japan may turn its attention to the Philippines, but it ultimately lacks a good way to compensate for the loss of exports from the United States.

Granting the Soviet Union a License to Lease Oil Tankers - Makes Japanese in the US Even More Anxious

Washington - American foreign policy, especially its Far Eastern policy, has suddenly changed direction, making Japan think today about whether it can still obtain gasoline, lead, iron, and steel from the United States, which are needed for the war against China. Japanese people here are very bewildered by the President's issuance of the export license order and also by the knowledge that the U.S. government has granted a Soviet company a license to transport oil across the Pacific Ocean on American oil tankers while rejecting the request of a Japanese company. However, President Roosevelt has consistently said that export restrictions are not a blockade but are for maintaining key raw materials for U.S. national defense. Many diplomats believe that the new export restrictions on special raw materials in Europe and Asia may be implemented at any time. The Japanese need a large amount of aviation gasoline in addition to a large amount of military metals. Once these new regulations are implemented, Japan may take testing measures. If metals and gasoline are banned or restricted, Japan will recognize this export restriction order as a blockade. It is believed that U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Welles and Japanese Ambassador to the United States Kenkichi Horiuchi must have discussed the export restrictions and the refusal of the Maritime Commission to allow Japan to use four U.S. oil tankers and two U.S. transport ships for export, but the two sides have not yet discussed the topics they want to discuss. The Maritime Commission, while rejecting the applications of Japanese and Spanish companies, approved the application of a Soviet company to transport goods on U.S. oil tankers less than 24 hours after President Roosevelt took action to place oil and iron under strict license control. The Maritime Commission did not mention a word in the announcement approving the Soviet company's application about the content of the previous notifications rejecting the applications of Japanese and Spanish companies. The Maritime Commission's notifications rejecting the applications of Japan and Spain stated that reserving U.S. oil tankers for trade in the Western Hemisphere was U.S. policy. There is much non-official speculation as to whether this U.S. action is leaning towards a policy of opposing the aggressor countries and helping the Soviet Union by providing more supplies. However, administrative officials have publicly denied these speculations. President Roosevelt only stated during a meeting with reporters that the U.S. announced that placing oil and iron under strict export restriction orders was to maintain the nutrients needed for U.S. national defense. The Maritime Commission said in a statement commenting on the approval of the Soviet application that each application is judged based on the merits and demerits of the case. The fact that the Maritime Commission rejected the Japanese application on July 20th and is now taking action on the Soviet company's application is even more intriguing. The New York World-Telegram reported that the Maritime Commission had rejected the shipment of kerosene to Spain before President Roosevelt issued the order, probably because the kerosene could be transshipped to Germany. The newspaper reported that the Maritime Commission took this action immediately after learning that a Spanish company was using a large number of American oil tankers and was planning to sail to various Spanish ports. A certain Spanish company used seven oil tankers between May 4th and June 8th. (United Press, 27th)

### Soviet-Finnish Agreement Signed - Demarcates the Aland Islands as a Demilitarized Zone - Allows Soviet Troops to Pass Through Finnish Territory to Hanko Port - Finland Ratifies Soviet-Finnish Trade Agreement

Moscow - The Soviet-Finnish agreement on three issues was signed here on July 23rd by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Finnish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Paasikivi. Regarding the Aland Islands, both sides agreed that they should be a demilitarized zone. The fortifications built during the Russo-Finnish conflict must be demolished, and Finland must not cede the islands to a third country. Soviet Russia may send personnel to inspect the islands from time to time to see if they have been demilitarized. Although Soviet Russia had a second proposal regarding the island issue, namely that Soviet Russia should cooperate in continuing to build fortifications, Finland did not agree. The second agreement is to allow Soviet Russian troops and military supplies to pass through Finland to the Hanko naval base. The third agreement is to return to Finland Soviet Russian machinery and factory equipment moved from the ceded areas. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)

### Territories in the Western Hemisphere - Cannot Be Violated - Pan-American Conference Adopts the "Havana Declaration"

Havana - The Pan-American Conference today adopted a "Havana Declaration" stating that the future of European territories in the Americas will be managed. The Pan-American representatives unanimously agreed to the declaration. The declaration solemnly affirms that the Western Hemisphere remains isolated from the wars in Europe and the Far East and that the economic aggression of the Communist, Fascist, and Nazi parties cannot be tolerated. The declaration is a compromise between the US proposal for collective custody of European territories in the Western Hemisphere and Argentina's "wait-and-see" attitude, as Argentina believes that it is best not to take any action unless the territories are actually threatened. This compromise was reached at a meeting of the Peace Preservation Council last night, chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Hull. Therefore, the decision of this declaration must be attributed to Hull. The Colonial Affairs Subcommittee met at Hull's residence at 8:00 a.m. today to begin drafting a fair plan regarding the colonies. The representatives appear to be very optimistic about the outcome of the issue of European colonies in the Western Hemisphere. (United Press, 27th)

### American Journalists in Shanghai - Petition Telegraph - President Roosevelt Announces - Handed Over to Japanese Correspondents' Association

Washington - President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that he would hand over the telegram sent to him this week by American journalists in Shanghai to the White House Correspondents' Association. The telegram from Shanghai asked the U.S. government to demand that the Japanese government take responsibility for the safety of American residents in the Japanese-occupied areas of China and to implement the embargo against Japan as announced by Roosevelt on Thursday. The White House Correspondents' Association is a private and non-official organization and has no real authority to intervene in this matter. Therefore, it is believed that the President handed this matter over to the Association in order to brush it aside, but at the same time, others believe that the Association can draw great public attention to this matter. These observers said that the President's remarks to reporters were actually a formal receipt of the telegram sent to him from Shanghai, and that he would no longer make an official announcement on the matter, so that the U.S. and Japan could seek a local solution on the matter. Acting Secretary of State Welles said that he also hoped that the matter could be resolved locally. The White House Correspondents' Association usually has the power to control foreign reporters' attendance at White House press conferences, but at this time, the officials of the Association do not intend to refuse Japanese reporters from continuing to participate in the press conferences as a retaliatory measure. Officials of the White House Correspondents' Association declined to comment on the President's remarks after receiving the telegram. (United Press, 27th)

### Soviet Parachute Experts - Technicians - Red Star Newspaper Praises Them in an Article

Moscow - Soviet parachute expert Romayek recently published an article in the Red Star newspaper on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Soviet parachute movement, stating that "The Soviet parachute movement began on July 26, 1930. Since then, the Soviet Union has trained a large number of parachute experts who are known worldwide for their skills. Yeyetenko Timofeyev opened his parachute only after falling 600 meters from the air. His artistry is unparalleled. Due to the invention of automatic machines, the Soviet Union's parachute altitude is unmatched in the world. The jump from 7,445 meters by Kosuyev on July 8, 1935, has been officially recognized as a world record. In addition, Katunov's record is 11,037 meters (August 24, 1937), Kalekonov's record is 12,443 meters (July 23, 1940), and Kostov's record is 7,750 meters (evening of July 24, 1940). Such excellent records are unique in the world." (TASS, 27th)

The Foreign Minister replied that Japan's foreign policy and other national policies are currently under careful consideration. (Reuters, 27th)

### Roosevelt States America is Willing to Exert Utmost Effort to Help Transport British Children, But Ships Must Be Guaranteed Safe Passage; House Foreign Affairs Committee Also Passes the Bill

Washington – President Roosevelt, at yesterday's press conference, hinted at the possibility of requesting safe passage for ships transporting British refugee children to the United States or Canada, stating that the United States is deeply willing to exert its utmost effort to assist in transporting British children. He can request reasonable guarantees that the refugee children will arrive safely in the Americas. The first step in this matter is to issue passports to approximately ten thousand children; the second step is to ascertain what actions the British government can take regarding the shipment of children to the Americas on British ships; the third step is for the United States to request reasonable guarantees that American ships going to Europe to transport children will not be attacked. A reporter asked for the President's opinion on the American ship transporting British children bill currently under consideration in Congress. President Roosevelt replied that there are three aspects to this issue: first, the attitude of the British government; second, the voluntary effort of the Americas; and third, the safety of the children, with the third item being the most important. Without reasonable guarantees of safe passage, ships flying the American flag and carrying children will bear a heavy responsibility. The sinking of the French ship "Meknes" serves as a warning. A reporter informed the President of a rumor circulating here that the United States, due to British blockade activities, might have to extend its war zone, from which American ships are prohibited, to the coast of Spain. President Roosevelt replied that this is the last open line of communication, and it should be maintained as long as possible. (Reuters, 27th)

Washington – The US House Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously passed a bill yesterday authorizing the use of American ships to transport European children out of war zones. The bill stipulates that ships used for this purpose must obtain security guarantees from all belligerent nations. (Reuters, 27th)

### US Aircraft Production to Meet Great Demand; British Request to the Defense Council; Factory Establishment Expenses Being Estimated

Washington – Knudsen, a leading production expert on the Defense Council, recently stated that according to the plan announced by Lord Beaverbrook, the British Minister of Aircraft Production, for the United States to supply Britain with three thousand aircraft per month, the United States is currently building 38 new factories. It is estimated that this production rate cannot be achieved before June or July 1942. The British Purchasing Commission has requested the US Defense Council to estimate the funds required to establish manufacturing plants at a rate of three thousand units per month. This estimate will be available this week. It is hoped that American production of various types of aircraft, excluding smaller commercial planes, will reach a total of 895 in August, and will increase significantly by October. The aircraft produced in the following months will include military aircraft for Britain (236 units) and the United States (396 units). The Wright Aircraft Company has borrowed $92 million from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to build a new aircraft engine factory, to increase the company's engine manufacturing capacity to approximately one thousand units per month. (Reuters, 27th)

Salzburg - Romanian dignitaries, after a brief stay in this city, will travel by special train to Rome to meet with Mussolini and Ciano to discuss Southeast European issues. (Haitong Telegraph, 27th)

Rome - The official Italian news agency announced that Romanian Prime Minister Manolescu, after meeting with Hitler in Berchtesgaden yesterday, arrived here this morning. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, representing Mussolini, greeted him at the station. The two traveled to the hotel, receiving a warm welcome from the public. Mussolini will soon grant him an audience. (Reuters, 27th)

Rome - Romanian Prime Minister Gigurtu and Foreign Minister Manolescu are scheduled to be received by the Italian King at 4:40 PM today, then lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at the Palazzo Venezia at 6:00 PM, and attend a banquet at the Romanian Embassy at 8:45 PM.

Goal of German-Romanian Talks: To Build a New Order in Southeast Europe

Salzburg - The talks between the Romanian ministers and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at the Fuschl Castle lasted for one hour. Führer Hitler then received the Romanian dignitaries at 4:15 PM, and the talks ended at 6:00 PM. In addition to German-Romanian issues, the question of a new order in Southeast Europe was also discussed. Allied sources claim that Germany's new order in Southeast Europe is based on the welfare of all nations and a solid commercial structure. The first step is to seek cooperation among all countries through peaceful means, and then protect the countries with German power, while promoting the welfare of the entire region. The talks between German and Southeast European politicians in the coming days will all be based on this goal. (Haitong Telegraph, 27th)

Berlin - Representatives from Poland and Romania are currently in Germany for negotiations. The journal "Berlin-Rome-Tokyo," edited by Dr. Schmidt of the German Foreign Office's Information Department, published an article titled "The Balkan Dispute," which reflects Germany's attitude toward the Balkan issue. Although the author's name was not published, it is generally believed to be a senior official of the German Foreign Office. The article states that Germany and Italy will not use new force or pressure to build a new order in Southeast Europe, but will allow the countries concerned to resolve territorial and ethnic issues with common sense. Germany and Italy's interest in peace and progress in the Balkans, for economic reasons, is the same as the efforts of the countries concerned to build an order that guarantees lasting peace. This goal cannot be achieved by diplomatic trickery, but must take into account the realities of future Europe. (Haitong Telegraph, 27th)

Germany Hopes to Establish Compromise Solution on Dispute Involving Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria

Stockholm - German Führer Hitler is currently busy resolving the Balkan issue, having separately approached Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria in the hope of establishing a compromise solution. Anxious to maintain Germany's position in Southeast Europe, he is proceeding with caution, fearing that other countries might take the lead. However, observers here believe that Hitler has already encountered some difficulties. Regarding the dispute between Hungary and Romania, the issue is simpler, requiring only advising Romania to cede a portion of the Sylvanian province to Hungary. This may be easier to achieve. However, regarding the dispute between Poland and Romania, forcing Romania to willingly cede the entire Dobruja region is not permissible under the circumstances, and persuading Poland to remain silent is also not easy in reality. Moreover, both the Soviet Union and Britain are prepared to support Poland, with Poland being particularly pro-Soviet. If Hitler fails to satisfy that country, it would be sufficient to drive it into the arms of the Soviet Union. In this situation, it is certainly not easy for Hitler to find a solution to the Balkan issue that will satisfy all the countries concerned. (Havas, 27th)

London - It is widely believed that after being forced to cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union, Romania will lose more territory. It is generally speculated that the result of yesterday's meeting between Hitler and Romanian Prime Minister Gigurtu and Foreign Minister Manolescu in Berchtesgaden will be that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will force the Romanian side to cede a narrow strip of western Sylvania to Hungary. The only question to be decided is how wide the strip will be. Semi-official Hungarian sources express the view that Hungary will not be satisfied with a half-hearted solution and that the Sylvanian city of Cluj must be handed over. Some observers say that Hungary will receive its gains in two batches in August and September. Moscow's attitude continues to attract very close attention in Budapest, and Hungary's friendship with Germany is now fully expressed, as Budapest police are currently strictly searching for those who distribute anti-German leaflets and taking action against a group suspected of distributing such leaflets. (Reuters, 27th)

Romanian Government Firmly States It Will Not Give Up National Sovereignty

Bucharest - A semi-official communiqué released here states that Prime Minister Gigurtu, accompanied by the Foreign Minister, visited Germany and Italy, expressing Romania's desire to make an effective contribution to the common life of the countries of the Danube and Balkan Peninsula and the maintenance of peace in Southern Europe. They will establish the necessary arrangements in this sense, and will never give up national sovereignty. All claims that Romania is prepared to relinquish its sovereignty are baseless. Romania pursues a policy of peace and is confident that its good relations with its neighbors and major powers will further improve. The entire nation holds a firm determination not to allow national interests to be violated and is determined to protect these interests, and will not hesitate to resort to arms if necessary. The Romanian government is currently fulfilling its peaceful mission with the united assistance of the military and the people. (Reuters, 27th)

### Rumors Abound That Germany Has Prepared Everything; Offensive Against Britain Not Expected to Be Far Off; Anticipated to Peak in Mid-August

Ankara - According to information received by Turkish diplomatic circles, after lengthy discussions led by General Göring, Hitler's confidant, Germany's offensive against Britain is expected to peak around mid-August. During this period, there will be group air raids on British shipping, along with some necessary preparations. It is also rumored that Hitler expects heavy casualties in the large-scale offensive and has established hospitals in western Germany, with nurses and doctors to be sent from Italy. However, this information must be treated with reservation. Germans are currently discussing their Führer's planned astounding strategy, with various incidents and attempts to spread misinformation likely to occur at the start of the offensive to divert attention and cause confusion. Meanwhile, Turkish opinion remains highly skeptical of Hitler's chances of success, believing that the risky plan he is about to undertake is contrary to the carefully considered judgment of many senior German officers. Some commentators here suggest that Hitler may change his mind, at least for the time being, and decide against the offensive. If so, in order to avoid losing prestige among the German people, he may instead launch a concentrated offensive against Egypt. (Reuters, 27th)

### Germany Launches Group Air Raids on British Convoys; Torpedo Boats Also Active in the Channel; Many British Armed Merchant Ships Damaged

London - As Germany has intensified its air raids on British ships and cities, the English Channel has become a scene of terrible battles involving merchant ships, warships, and aircraft over the past 48 hours. At least thirty German planes have been shot down in the area, five British small ships and one fishing boat have been sunk, and two British destroyers and several German motor torpedo boats have been damaged. Most of the damage occurred on Thursday when over a hundred German planes launched the most intense attacks on British ships. The German planes, divided into groups of thirty, repeatedly bombed twenty-one coastal ships, resulting in the sinking of five small ships escorted by fishing boats, totaling 5,104 tons, and damaging five ships totaling 5,133 tons. One coastal ship weighing 554 tons was forced to run aground on the beach after being damaged. The news of the above losses was revealed by officials here today to refute the German communiqué's claims of sinking eleven British ships totaling 43,000 tons and severely damaging ships totaling 12,000 tons. Shortly after the German air raids on the convoys, nine German motor torpedo boats came to attack. Two British destroyers and two motor torpedo boats immediately sailed out to intercept them. Upon seeing the British ships, the German boats immediately released smoke screens and retreated. The British ships pursued them, exchanging fire for fifteen minutes, but due to the heavy smoke, the extent of the damage to the German boats could not be determined. Upon returning, the British ships were twice subjected to fierce attacks by German dive bombers, both suffering minor damage, with some casualties among the crew. Subsequently, British planes took to the air and launched a fierce attack. Most of the twenty-eight German planes shot down that day were shot down in this battle. The British fishing boat "Fleming" was sunk by four German planes. When the planes appeared, the "Fleming" was traveling with another fishing boat, the "White Bales". As the "Fleming" sank, the "White Bales" opened fire with its anti-aircraft guns, hitting the German plane's bomb rack, causing the German plane to explode into pieces in mid-air. Another German plane was also hit by the "White Bales" and severely damaged, likely unable to return to base. The survivors of the "Fleming" were rescued by the fishing boat "Corina". Neither the "White Bales" nor the "Corina" suffered any casualties. (Reuters, 27th)

### British Planes Fly Over Germany and Successfully Bomb

London - British Air Force bombers flew over Germany and German-occupied areas last night, launching successful attacks and causing serious damage to German air power. According to an Air Ministry communiqué, the main targets of the British planes were oil depots and aircraft factories in Bremen and other places, as well as fourteen airfields in Germany and the Netherlands. Military targets such as freight yards in the Ruhr were also bombed. A German fighter attempting to intercept a British bomber was shot down. Five British planes did not return. (Reuters, 27th)

London - The British government has denied the New York report that Hitler has asked the King of Sweden to propose peace to Britain. Well-informed sources say that it would be absurd to suggest that Britain could consider the peace terms published by the New York Daily News, as the contents of the terms are as follows: (1) The British Empire should be located outside of mainland Europe; (2) Germany obtains Cameroon and former German East Africa, while former German Southwest Africa remains with the Union of South Africa; (3) Germany obtains Belgian Congo; (4) Germany guarantees the British Empire from the "Yellow Peril"; (5) Norway becomes a German province; (6) Belgium is a German protectorate; (7) Germany continues to occupy French territory outside of Paris in German-occupied areas; (8) The Netherlands is a German protectorate; (9) Italy has free movement in Spain and Greece, and obtains land along the Adriatic Sea.

### The German Police Autocrat, Himmler

The British government has long believed that dissatisfaction and revolution would arise within Germany to overthrow Hitler's autocratic rule. Furthermore, some believed that the peoples of the countries suppressed by Hitler's military force would revolt. Therefore, Germany's long-term war would dissipate the morale of its people, eventually causing Hitler to repeat the mistakes of Wilhelm II.

These fantasies have already been disappointed in the past and will likely be difficult to realize in the future, because there is a man of outstanding intelligence and cruel nature in Germany. This man is Heinrich Himmler, who exclusively controls the police power and commands the party army. The scale of the police force he created is unprecedented. This type of police once helped Hitler rise to power, foiled various conspiracies, and in Hitler's recent war of conquest in Europe, advanced with the army to suppress the resistance of the local people with violence.

Himmler concurrently holds the positions of Supreme Commander of the National Socialist Party's Protective Squadron, Chief of the German Police, and Director-General of the Political Police (Gestapo). His role for Hitler is the same as that of French Police Minister Fouché for Napoleon 150 years ago, but Himmler's ruthlessness and effectiveness far exceed those of 150 years ago.

Among Hitler's aides, Himmler is the least noticeable. He is 40 years old and looks like the principal of a German provincial school. He is of medium height, wears spectacles, and is not suitable for wearing a steel helmet and uniform. He is slow to speak, and only gives speeches when absolutely necessary. Key figures in Berlin value socializing, but Himmler feels embarrassed when he enters a social setting.

Hitler, Göring, and Goebbels have all built mansions, but Himmler still lives with his wife and daughter in a simple small house in the suburbs of Berlin. His wife is a Bavarian farm girl who does not like to order servants around. She mostly does the cooking and housework herself. Himmler works for ten hours every day, and when he has free time, he always amuses himself with his ten-year-old daughter, Gertrud.

I still remember fifteen years ago, when key members of the National Socialist Party were sitting around a table in a Munich beer hall. Hitler was in prison at the time, and party affairs were presided over by Hitler's confidant, Schleicher. Himmler was also present. When Schleicher was lecturing on National Socialism, he put his hand on Himmler's shoulder and said, "Take my secretary—the gentle Himmler—as an example. He handles matters thoroughly. He has an amazing brain for calculating numbers and organizing. However, he will not advance in the revolutionary movement. He is too gentle, and his thoughts and appearance are like an accountant." That gentle Himmler rolled his eyes, smiled, and did not say a word.

However, on a certain night in June 1934, Schleicher and hundreds of old party members were shot dead by the party army commanded by Himmler, which proved that they had misjudged Himmler. In fact, it can be said that all the people of Germany had misjudged him. The gentle Himmler actually harbored an iron will, and his power was second only to Hitler's.

The National Socialist Party's Protective Squadron, commanded by Himmler, consists of 450,000 outstanding young Germans, well-trained and fully mechanized. This Protective Squadron was originally an elite unit of the party army, responsible for guarding Hitler and other important figures, guarding concentration camps, and suppressing internal unrest. Himmler has reorganized it into a regular army, equipped with tanks, artillery, and air force. This type of army served as the vanguard in the offensives against Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium.

This army is also responsible for "consolidating" the occupied areas of the army through massacres and forced relocation unparalleled in European history. Himmler has served as Director-General of the Political Police for seven years, obeying only Hitler. He can arrest anyone without going through ordinary legal procedures, send them to concentration camps, or sentence them to death. The 2,500 special agents under his command have all been trained in political work in special schools. His assistant, Reinhard Heydrich, has a hideous face and dark complexion, and is known for his cunning and brutality. A large-scale network of spies is deployed in stores, offices, factories, hotels, restaurants, universities, and the army, navy, and air force throughout Germany, engaging in reconnaissance at all times.

The local political police stations receive a lot of information, and the relevant ones are forwarded to the headquarters in Berlin. There are 200 clerks specializing in sorting and classifying work. This type of political police is equipped with special telephones to eavesdrop on news. When major events occur, they conduct investigations, and their power is almost unlimited, but the Protective Squadrons are responsible for carrying out the arrests.

In the past seven years, about one million Germans have been interrogated by the political police and sent to concentration camps, and countless people have died instantly.

Himmler also created concentration camps, which are specifically used to detain Jews and Communists. However, since their establishment, many National Socialist Party members have also been detained for making careless remarks.

What Himmler is most proud of is the Political Police Bureau's foreign affairs division. The 5,000 special agents in this division monitor the relationship between German emigrants abroad and the outside world, and conspire to subvert foreign governments. Several months before Germany annexed Austria and Czechoslovakia, this division of special agents was secretly working in German embassies, consulates, and "travel agencies." Within 24 hours after the overthrow of the Austrian and Czech governments, many important anti-National Socialist figures in those countries were arrested, which was done by these people. They sabotaged transportation lines in Poland and almost kidnapped King Haakon in Norway. The "fifth column" valued by the German army was arranged by them.

Another important task of Himmler is to protect Hitler's own safety. Hitler's bodyguard is an organization of 3,000 tall, absolutely obedient Protective Squadron members. These 3,000 people have all received formal military training. Their black uniforms are exquisitely made and are perhaps the most magnificent team in the world. When Hitler resides in the Berghof in Berchtesgaden, 300 people are responsible for protection. In Berlin, 100 people guard around the Chancellery, and the remaining 2,600 people are stationed in the luxurious barracks in the nearby Lichterfelde district, ready to be summoned at any time. Every time Hitler goes to Austria and Czechoslovakia, they must ensure that the roads he passes are safe. When Hitler appears in public, they must surround him closely. All the movements around Hitler cannot escape the sharp eyes of these teams.

Himmler has the political police as his eyes and ears, and the Protective Squadron as his claws and teeth. His political power is naturally extremely great. The weaknesses and misdeeds of the highest-ranking members of the National Socialist Party have also fallen into Himmler's hands. From Röhm to General von Fritsch, all important figures were killed for opposing him. Himmler has overthrown one army minister and two chiefs of staff. Eight of Hitler's cabinet members wear Protective Squadron uniforms. Göring, Goebbels, and others are cautious in everything before Himmler. Even Hitler must rely on his power.

Himmler was born in a quiet small village called Lindau on the shores of beautiful Lake Constance in the Bavarian Alps. His father was a respected school inspector and devout Catholic who hoped that Himmler would succeed him in his career. This hope was dashed by the last World War. At the age of seventeen, Himmler joined the Bavarian infantry, but he was assigned to clerical work. After the war, Himmler made every effort to oppose the Communists who ruled Bavaria at the time. He joined the National Socialist Party in Munich and was intoxicated by Hitler's words and thoughts.

At that time, when National Socialist Party members gathered, they were often scattered by Communists throwing stones. Hitler thought of organizing a special Protective Squadron, each holding wooden sticks, to drive away troublemakers. This was the origin of the Protective Squadron. Himmler soon joined this Protective Squadron, and by 1927, he was promoted to deputy commander-in-chief, and by his unique thorough methods, he finally trained the disorganized brutes into the most rigorous organization.

By 1929, when Himmler was promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Protective Squadron, there were more than 100,000 well-trained and well-equipped members.

At the same time, another unit in the party army called the Stormtroopers had also expanded to 1.2 million people. Most of the members were from humble backgrounds, had no discipline at all, were unreliable, and were not easy to command. Commander Röhm was very ambitious. Hitler then discussed with Röhm's backstage old boss, the Rhine industrialists, and army generals, and discussed with Himmler and Göring the method to solve him. The Protective Squadron was dispatched on the night of June 30, 1934, and by dawn, the important figures of the Stormtroopers were caught in one fell swoop.

Röhm died immediately, the Stormtroopers disintegrated, and the Protective Squadron and the Political Police became the pillars of Hitler's regime. Hitler also made Göring give up his post as Chief of the Prussian Police, and Himmler was appointed as the dictator of the entire German police. (Excerpt from Current History)

The strictness of the procedures can be seen. The atmosphere in the examination hall was also extremely quiet. The students were all calmly thinking, hoping to achieve the purpose of entering school. It was found that there were about 20 absentees this time, but there were no cases of late arrival or violation of regulations, so the situation was very good.

### School News

Lixin Accounting College The Lixin Accounting College held its first new student entrance examination for the 29th year on July 19 and 20. The number of applicants was very enthusiastic. The results of each item have been evaluated and announced.

It is heard that there is still a balance, and it is planned to continue recruiting new students on August 23 and 24.

China Institute of Technology The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Alumni Association of this port founded the China Institute of Technology, adopting the school-factory cooperation system, which has achieved remarkable results in the American industrial education community. The shortcoming of ordinary schools is that the teaching materials in the school are not enough to meet the actual needs of the society. The advantage of the cooperation system is to clearly understand how to train the talents required by the industrial community, instill the required knowledge in the school, and cultivate the necessary skills in the factory. The electrical service department, cotton textile engineering department, and automobile engineering department of the China Institute of Technology have all signed cooperation methods with the factories founded or presided over by the alumni of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in this port. Continental Swimming School at No. 580 Jing'an Temple Road Continental Swimming Pool, in order to promote sports, a swimming school has been specially established, teaching basic exercises such as treading water, freestyle, and breaststroke in the shortest possible time.

### Grain Prices
Difficult Times for the People's Food: Rice Prices Plummet Like a Bursting Dam; Over 500,000 Bags in Stock, Over 200,000 En Route; 15,000 Newly Arrived, and Incoming Amounts Still Considerable

The decline in foreign rice prices became even more intense yesterday, plummeting all the way down like a torrent from a burst dam. This is truly a welcome event amidst difficult times for the people's food. Statistics show that prices have continued to fall by as much as two or three yuan. Except for high-grade foreign rice, which is still at 50 yuan, all other mid- to low-grade goods have fallen below the major price threshold. This is due to abundant stockpiles in warehouses, not less than 500,000 bags, and also because 200,000 bags are en route and will arrive in succession. Buyers are not buying, and sellers cannot sell, so transactions are rare. The market prices for all goods have fallen repeatedly without any signs of life. For example, No. 1 old Saigon rice closed at only 52.5 yuan, and No. 2 Saigon rice fell as low as 46 yuan. No. 2 Siam rice opened at 48.3 yuan but also fell as low as 46 yuan, showing extreme weakness. This is because the large batches of orders arriving now are mostly No. 2 Saigon and Siam rice. Compared to the highest price of 65 or 66 yuan at the beginning of the month, this is a drastic drop of 20 or 19 yuan. Other rice types have also fallen by more than 15 yuan. This decline not only exceeds the rice merchants' pricing but also differs by 5 or 6 yuan to 7 or 8 yuan compared to current production prices. This rice price reversal and drop has truly exceeded general expectations. There are still two ships of Siam rice en route. The combined total of arrived and arriving shipments is about 200,000 bags, with a value estimated at tens of millions of yuan. Furthermore, new arrivals require payment upon delivery. Therefore, goods en route are more likely to be soft compared to goods already in stock. The goods loaded on the 26th of last month opened at 58 yuan, immediately falling by one yuan. Then they gradually declined, falling to 56.5 yuan. Ultimately, even at 56 yuan, there were no buyers, so it fell by 3 yuan but still couldn’t stabilize. Previously arrived original packages opened at 56.7 yuan, but no one inquired again. However, about 500 to 600 tons were transacted for back-and-forth trading. Only 4,000 bags are currently available.

Foreign rice continues to arrive. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Qingyuan vessel shipped 10,826 bags to Shanghai from Hong Kong, docking at the company's pier in Pudong for unloading. Also, Jardine Matheson's Fusheng vessel arrived yesterday morning, carrying 4,340 bags from Hong Kong, docking at the Roosevelt Pier for unloading. Additionally, there were 110 bags originally destined for Yantai. Furthermore, 328 bags were loaded in the city to be transported to Yantai. Large quantities of foreign rice are expected to arrive in port in the coming days. (Zu)

Although deliveries of domestic japonica and glutinous rice have been sparse, the overall market situation has deteriorated, and foreign rice is being sold off sharply. The unofficial trading prices have also declined in unison. The quoted prices are more than two yuan lower than before. Changbang Qinggeng Fresh Special is 65.5 yuan or 65 yuan, Wuxi Qinggeng is 64 yuan, Changzhou Su Kun japonica is 62-63 yuan, and inferior grades are around 58 yuan. Early Bo Dao rice has not yet been released, and early Nangang He is 56-57 yuan. Glutinous rice Jinli goods are around 61 yuan, and Changdan goods are 58-59 yuan. Hong Kong white rice has not yet been quoted.

### Flour and Wheat Transactions Holding Back
Ultimately, Prices Are Too High

Flour: Transactions were quite sluggish yesterday. Because it was the weekend, both local and out-of-town buyers were hesitant. On Mok Street, although the factory price had been revised to 5 jiao, it was still considered too high. Local sales were further weakened by the dumping of cheap Japanese flour, causing demand to stagnate further. Therefore, the buyers' price for Grade 2 Zhengpai flour fell to below 17 yuan but still lacked buyers. The wholesale price on this street remained at 15.5 yuan. If the harvest of wheat on Mok Street increases in the future, there is a possibility of further decline. Other Japanese factory flours, such as the Phoenix brand, have attracted the attention of re-export buyers after days of price reductions and sales. It is said that there is an intention to raise prices for recycled goods. The market is currently holding steady.

Wheat: Yesterday, because inland production prices were reported to be down by one yuan for several days, the amount stored and arriving in Shanghai gradually increased. Factories took advantage of this to frequently reduce prices. However, cargo owners, having acquired their goods earlier at high cost, were unwilling to devalue them further. Moreover, with it being the weekend, both buyers and sellers were in a state of resistance. However, with rice and flour prices falling, it is feared that the market will ultimately have difficulty standing its ground. In the end, the Hua Factory only purchased about 1,000 bags of Su Kun wheat at a price of 21.5 yuan each.

### Finance
Foreign Exchange Futures
More Active Buying

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial markets for British and American currencies showed a slight weakening in a quiet environment. This was due to active buying interest from foreign firms, and the supply of chips was slightly less than demand, causing prices to tighten slightly. However, the environment still did not show significant changes, and it was difficult to generate momentum. Speculators were very active in purchasing forward contracts, so the trend was easier to tighten. Today, the spot USD rate was quoted at 6.09375 after 9:45, and the initial rate for the pound sterling was 3 shillings 8.875 pence. However, the noon close remained flat, ultimately closing at 3 shillings 8.90625 pence for the pound sterling and 6.09375 for the USD, a decrease of 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively compared to the previous close. Futures were similar.

British and American Currencies Slightly Tightened

In the early morning, the London long rate increased by 0.1875 and the forward rate increased by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained flat, and London gold remained stable. The British-American exchange rate remained unchanged, and there was no market for French currency. The USD increased by 1.5 points against the pound, decreased by 3 points against Shanghai currency, and there was no market for French currency. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning at 3 shillings 8.90625 pence for British currency and 6.125 yuan for the USD, with the USD flat and British currency tightening by 0.015625 compared to the previous day's closing price. This was due to a slight rebound in the exchange rate. Initially, foreign firms came to sell, but both foreign and domestic firms were keen to absorb them, so the initial situation was flat. The USD rate for this month was 6.125. The HSBC listing was revealed to be unchanged, and the silver balance tax was revealed to have increased by 1.25%. Although American firms also came to sell, the buying interest from foreign firms was quite strong, so prices weakened slightly. The American firms sold this month's USD to foreign firms, retreating to 6.09375. However, there was no change in forward contracts. Chinese speculators purchased August USD at 6.0625 from British bank McCallie, and foreign firm Sassoon also purchased August USD at 6.0625 from the same bank. It was heard that the softest spot rate for the pound sterling was 3 shillings 8.875 pence, but the closing price returned to flat. The USD was also very stable. The British currency closed at 3 shillings 8.90625 pence, the USD at 6.09375, the August British currency at 3 shillings 8.875 pence, and the USD at 6.03125. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Slight Fluctuation in the Weekly Foreign Exchange Market

The range of fluctuation in this week's foreign exchange market has become smaller. The British currency is 0.0625 and the American currency is 0.09375. Changes in the British exchange rate have always been slower. As in the previous week, it was only 3/32. The American exchange rate has changed more rapidly due to changes in the British-American exchange rate. For example, in the previous week, it was still 15/32. The overall trend of foreign exchange this week is that the British exchange rate has risen slightly. The highest price for the USD, except for the closing price on Saturday, was 6 and 5/32. The closing price was 6 and 3/32. The difference between the spot rate and the July forward rate and the August rate is 1/64 for the British exchange rate and 1/16 for the American exchange rate for the entire week.

Little Change in Hong Kong Exchange Rates

Hong Kong, 27th (Saturday telegram): The foreign exchange market opened quietly this morning. There were no changes in the British, American, and Japanese exchange rates. (Yesterday's USD closing price still contracted to 23.5 yuan.) The Shanghai currency spot rate decreased slightly by 0.5 yuan to 382 yuan. At 10:15, the Shanghai currency spot rate rebounded by 0.5 yuan to 382.5 yuan. At 11:30, it was flat. There were no gains or losses in any exchange rates. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

The Tianjin Market is Also Stagnant

Tianjin, 27th (Saturday) telegram: The agricultural market opened flat this morning. There were no increases or decreases in the British, American, or Shanghai exchange rates. Only the "Joint Note" unofficial price rose by 1.25 yuan to 93.5 yuan.

### Gold Market Rises Very Slightly

Yesterday's cash gold unofficial market saw fluctuations between 5,300 yuan and 350 yuan. Sentiment can be said to be firm, with rises and advances, and interest is strong. Moreover, the foreign exchange market slightly reported weakening, and selling pressure was significantly reduced. The initial opening was only 5,320 yuan, and the Qian Dui industry gold shop took the lead in selling, pushing it down another 20 yuan to a low of 5,300 yuan. Subsequently, the two sides suddenly changed hands and advanced again, and the price returned to 5,350 yuan. As a result, they closed with a surplus settled at a high price, retreating to 5,332 yuan as the closing price, an increase of 4 yuan compared to the previous day.

Red Gold Up Four Yuan

Since the morning, the exchange rate reported an increase per bar (ten taels), and sentiment was slightly tired. When it opened, the Qian Dui industry first sold, and it was immediately pushed down by 8 yuan. The Qian Dui industry issued 30 taels to the securities group, at 5,320 yuan. As more sellers gradually emerged, the gold shop group also followed suit and sold, so it gradually fell to 20 yuan. The Qian Dui industry issued dozens of taels from the silver shop, yielding 5,300 yuan. However, at that time, the buying households were quite strong, and the decline was immediately stopped. Moreover, soon the silver shop group suddenly came to frantically drag, coupled with the Qian Dui industry stopping selling and switching to buying, because the foreign exchange was slightly tight, and before long it rose by 50 yuan. The silver shop advanced 30 taels to the gold shop, at 5,350 yuan. Unexpectedly, after this, the number of buyers decreased, and the price fell again. Moreover, the Tianjin group and the surplus all had sales, and it had retreated to 5,323 yuan near noon. Later, the foreign exchange market reported weakening, and the silver shop group came back to search and enter again, and then raised it by several yuan again. The silver shop advanced 20 taels to the same industry, at 5,332 yuan, as the noon closing price. As a result, it was 4 yuan higher than the previous day. There were 50 yuan fluctuations in half a day.

### Yarn and Cotton
Bullish Action
Yarn Prices Rebound
Double Horse Reaches 956 Yuan

The yarn market, which had been hovering for many days, showed a significant turnaround and improved yesterday. This is because there were again bullish rumors in the market. Generally, the bulls, seeing the market inactive for a long time, took action. At the same time, although there was no large-scale development in actual transactions in Hong Kong, there were still many scattered purchases. Therefore, everyone bought a few packs, and the surface slightly tightened, and the market rebounded. In short, the market has been hovering for a long time and has a tendency to move after a long period of stillness. Because inventories are still sufficient, there is no fear of soaring prices in the future.

The morning opening for current yarn showed a slightly stable trend in the market atmosphere. However, the majority of scalpers have mediocre thoughts, so transactions were not strong. The opening price was 940 yuan. Unexpectedly, few sellers offered at this price. A certain Feng brand came to purchase again.

### Cotton Market Remains Quiet
5,200 Bales of Indian Cotton Arrive

Spot transactions were slightly more active, but factory acquisitions have not yet developed. However, sentiment is slightly inclined to be firm because the foreign cotton market is also hovering.

At the same time, the yarn market has risen, and raw cotton has stabilized accordingly. 300 bales of fire machine cotton were transacted among the same trade at a price of 153 yuan. 300 pieces of Indian cotton at 205 yuan were transacted in warehouse delivery.

According to another source, the foreign cotton market in New York initially declined due to a lack of significant buyers and improved reports on the cotton area climate. In addition, due to reduced spot demand, the closing price fell by 3-5 points compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market rose by 10 rupees due to speculation, along with predictions of price increases.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market was quiet throughout the day. All parties maintained a wait-and-see attitude. Only one or two factories slightly purchased a small amount of missing cotton, but the amount was extremely small. The market inventory is not abundant, and those with long fibers are the most abundant. Japanese manufacturers are quiet. It is generally expected that transactions will take place next month.

A large batch of Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai. The Yaja Company's Hirila vessel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, carrying 5,200 bales from Calcutta, docking at the Qichang warehouse in Pudong for unloading.

### Securities
Class A is the Most Popular

The securities unofficial market turned firmer again yesterday. Customers gradually found interest in buying goods, although the number was not large, but this was enough to encourage people on the narrow surface. The price of Class A stocks was the most popular, exceeding 3 yuan again yesterday, only a little bit away from the highest price on the 16th. Other types differed more from the recent high prices, so the market price with interest during the period was not easy to fall. Yesterday morning, Renchang and Tongkang absorbed more. No. 35 and Hengfu Lianyi both absorbed. Lemao sold some. Hongda sold Class B and bought Class C. Datong, Runli, and Jiufeng all had sales, but the market price was still very firm. In the afternoon, Lianhe bought a lot of Class A. Dakangcheng specialized in buying Class E. Others, such as Defu, Gongmao, and Shuntai, all had considerable interest. Therefore, even in the sales of Yichang, Shengda, Lianyi, and Jiufeng, the market price continued to advance. The market situation is gradually improving.

### Financial Commentary

— Sheng

— To July 27th —

The exchange rate of the British pound, since August 1939, due to the British declaration of war against Germany, the market price has rapidly declined. At the closing price on the London market, it fell from about 4.68 on August 24 to about 4.48 on the 25th, fell to 4.19 on September 2, and fell further to 4.02 on the 5th. Therefore, on September 14, the British government stipulated a legal price to sell U.S. dollars at 4.02 and buy U.S. dollars at 4.04. From then on, the London pound exchange rate became stable. It rose to 4.025 on January 6, 1940, and has not changed since. However, on the New York market, the pound exchange rate fell very quickly. At the closing market price, it fell from 4.68125 to 3.85 in the five months from August to December in 1939. Therefore, a free pound came into being on the foreign financial market. After the Foreign Exchange Control Ordinance was implemented on March 25, 1940, the decline in the free pound market price became even more rapid. It was seen at 3.15 yuan in April. On June 8, the foreign exchange rule was strengthened, and the free pound market price slightly improved. The market price statistics from 1939 to July 26, 1940 are recorded below:

1939

August 4.68 4.29

September 4.26 3.82

October 4.06 3.96

November 4.00 3.85

December 3.96 3.90

1940

January 4.00 3.93

February 3.99 3.93

March 3.94 3.53

April 3.58 3.46

May 3.50 3.15

June 3.87 3.19

July 3.91 3.66

Although British wartime foreign exchange has been tightened three times, it has still been unable to prevent the decline in the free pound. According to estimates by the London "Economist" magazine, the amount of free pounds used accounts for only 5% to 10% of Britain's total foreign public and private income and expenditure. Therefore, there are two opinions on the existence of free pounds: those who support the existence of free pounds say that the trend of the pound market price in the informal market does not need to be interfered with and should be allowed to find its own equilibrium level. If there is an excessive decline, it will promote British exports, encourage the repayment of debts owed by foreigners, and as a result, it can correct the excessive decline. However, those who oppose the existence of free pounds believe that the decline in the pound is detrimental to Britain's financial and political reputation, and the harm to British international trade is even greater, because the decline in the free pound now cannot have the same effect on promoting exports as in normal times. The quantity of wartime exports depends on how much surplus there is after domestic needs, and the relationship between the high and low exchange rate is lighter. As for foreigners purchasing pounds to repay debts, if the free pound trend is unstable, debtors will instead wait and see and wait for a more favorable free pound market price in the future to purchase pounds for debt repayment. Therefore, some people suggest that if you want to ban free pounds, you can only find ways to reduce their source. As a result, there are strict foreign exchange control measures on June 8.

### US Bans Scrap Iron and Gasoline Exports
Taking Action Instead of Warnings
The Export Licensing System Has Broad Significance
People of Insight Should Not Ignore This Move
(Woodhead's Insightful Remarks)

The English-language "Great American Evening Post" carried an article yesterday by Woodhead discussing the de facto embargo on scrap iron and gasoline by the United States, stating that Washington's announcement that exports of scrap iron and gasoline would require special licenses has broad significance. This movement has been vigorously promoted by powerful figures in the past few months, mainly as a gesture against Japan. American sympathizers of China have urged the government to implement an embargo, saying that the United States' protests against Japan's indiscriminate bombing of China, especially endangering the lives and property of Americans in China, is contradictory while the United States continues to supply the Japanese government with scrap iron and gasoline.

Tension between the US and Japan Creates the Situation

It is now understood that the US is implementing an embargo, not only to limit such goods from falling into the hands of Japan, but also to prevent them from being transferred to the Axis countries through Spain. Therefore, the export licensing system is about to be implemented, and it cannot be seen as anything other than the result of the increasingly tense and serious relationship between the US and Japan. This is not only due to the continuous incidents in Shanghai arousing widespread anger in the United States, but also to the trade restrictions implemented by the Japanese in North China, causing foreign import and export trade to suffer the equivalent of an embargo. Japan protested against the US's moral embargo on limiting important war supplies, while at the same time excluding American commerce in North China. The illogicality is self-evident.

Oil Tankers to Japan Denied Licenses

The US government has already refused to issue permits to oil tankers heading to Japan, which is just another step in refusing to ship oil to Japan and Japanese-occupied areas. The Japanese Konoe Cabinet is now seeking to completely reform the country's foreign policy. The content is still to be announced, but it is generally believed that it will likely involve joining the Axis powers and expressing a tough attitude towards Anglo-Saxon nations. Some Japanese extremists are openly advocating challenging the US, but it remains questionable whether Konoe and his foreign minister are inclined to this view. However, it cannot be denied that some Japanese in China are openly taking dangerous actions that are detrimental to the United States.

Effective Warning, Unable to Sit Back and Watch

Although a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy claimed that Japan had not adopted an anti-American attitude, the facts cannot be denied. Japanese troops in Hangzhou participated in the distribution of leaflets "demanding that the United States withdraw from East Asia" and threatened that "after the new Japanese cabinet is formed, it will take other steps to deal with [the United States]." How can it be denied that the anti-American movement has official support? The US President's decision to take action and extend his embargo powers to US oil and iron exports is a warning that sensible people in Japan cannot ignore. This matter clearly demonstrates the official anger over the recent incidents in Shanghai and other parts of China that have affected Americans. Nanjing actually demanded the expulsion of six American expatriates, placing the situation in an extremely dangerous situation. The violence and anti-American movements committed by Nanjing in Shanghai are in line with the widespread flood of anger in the United States.

### Negotiations on the Resumption of Navigation of German Ships in Zhejiang Waters
No Results Yet
According to Lulin & Co., Results May Be Seen by the End of the Month

The Shanghai-Zhejiang shipping line, which has been blocked for nearly half a month, has had more than 20 foreign ships stop because of the unsuccessful negotiations by the relevant foreign parties. Since the German shipping companies in Shanghai submitted a request to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with Japan, as of yesterday afternoon, according to the news from the shipping department of Lihe & Co., there were still no results from the negotiations, so the hope of resuming navigation for ships such as Mofu Hai Fu was very small. However, according to German Lulin & Co., the negotiations may be expected to yield results by the 30th of this month, so whether the company's Gaodeng vessel will go to Likang Port and whether the Feikang vessel, which recently returned to Shanghai from Wenzhou, will sail to Wenzhou again may be announced by the 30th of this month. As for the British-owned Shenfu vessel of Yilong Co., which left Shanghai for Fujian ten days ago, there is still no news.

Customs Clearance Difficult to Approve

Because the Jianghai Customs received a notice from the Japanese Navy that foreign ships are prohibited from completing customs clearance for ports blocked in Zhejiang and Fujian. According to senior customs officials of Western nationality, since the Japanese Navy has imposed a blockade there, unexpected events may still occur even if the customs release the ships. Therefore, for the safety of passengers and cargo traveling to the coastal ports of Zhejiang and Fujian, the ban on stopping customs clearance cannot be lifted until the notice of lifting the blockade from the Japanese Navy is received.

Haimen Navigation Affairs

Haimen in Zhejiang is also subject to the ban on navigation. Moreover, it is not a fallen area, so Japanese commercial ships cannot navigate there. The report that the Huadong vessel of the Huadong Shipping Bureau sailed to Haimen is actually a misreport.

### The Municipal Administration of the Eastern District is Decaying; Foreigners Protest; Police and Sanitation are Ineffective; Foreigners Agree Not to Pay Taxes

A certain newspaper reports: Several foreigners residing in Lane 609, Ward Road East, in the mountainous area, recently told a reporter that if the authorities do not provide adequate police protection and sanitation services, and remove the corpses exposed in the lane, they are determined not to pay municipal taxes. One of the foreigners reportedly said that beggars die every night in the neighborhood around them, and no one collects the bodies. He had been robbed twice recently and had not seen any patrolmen. Moreover, garbage trucks do not come regularly, and they never come when it rains. They have repeatedly protested to the local police station, but to no avail. Therefore, they will not pay a penny in taxes until the situation improves. However, a group of houses there is inhabited by German refugees who have recently arrived in Shanghai and dare not take any action, so they are still paying taxes on time. A Western woman also said that she was recently robbed of her handbag by bandits in broad daylight in the middle of the road, and there were no patrolmen around, so she could not call for help. There are more and more beggars' corpses exposed in the lanes, and swarms of flies gather, which is a serious threat to the health of the residents of the district.

### The Gas Company's Labor Strike; No Negotiations; Rumor Has It That Various Parties are Mediating; The Company Has Not Heard of It

The spokesperson of the British Gas Company issued a statement yesterday, saying that the company is currently training a new batch of employees to replace the old employees who sympathized with the workers and went on strike together. All employees are now being reorganized and foreign employees are being placed among them to prevent the same situation from happening in the future.

In addition, the cost of temporary Russian and Jewish workers is 3,000 yuan per day. The strike of Chinese employees has caused the company to hire another 160 people to replace them.

### Tong Shiheng, Manager of Zhufeng Enamel Factory, Was Kidnapped Yesterday; Bandits Ambushed in Front of the Factory Gate on Binlang Road; Seized Tong and the Car When He Came Out

At the gate of the Zhufeng Enamel Factory on Binlang Road, Shanghai West, at 10:43 AM yesterday, a kidnapping case suddenly occurred. The kidnapped person was Tong Shiheng, the manager of the factory. As a result, three bandits jumped into Tong's car No. 6369 one after another and drove west towards the Chinese area. The details of the investigation are as follows:

Just Stepped into the Car; Bandits Emerged

Tong Shiheng, styled Jitong, is from Jiading, 57 years old, and resides at No. 24, Jingucun, Aimeiyu Road, Jin Shenfu Road, French Concession. He is the manager of Zhufeng Enamel Factory. As usual, Tong took car No. 6369 to the factory on Binlang Road to work at about 5:00 AM every day. At about 10:43 AM yesterday morning, Tong finished his work in the factory and planned to return to his residence to rest. When he was about to leave the factory gate, Chen Kecheng (50 years old, from Nantong), the gatekeeper of the factory, saw ×× leave and opened the car door. Tong stepped into the car. Just as he was closing the car door, three bandits suddenly emerged from the side, all dressed in short clothes and holding guns. They rushed up. The car driver, Jiang Jintai (over 30 years old, from Yancheng) pretended to step on the engine immediately and drove west. Jiang witnessed the situation and knew that things were not good. Although he was under duress, his movements were deliberately slow, which caused the bandits to be dissatisfied and drag Jiang down.

Bandits Drove the Car; Speeding West

Another bandit stepped into the car and drove it himself. Because the engine was not easy to start from time to time, the other two bandits helped push the car body and forced several pedestrians to help push the car. After about four or five minutes, the car started to move slowly and sped away to the west. At this time, the gatekeeper Chen Acheng ran back to the factory and shouted, "The manager has been kidnapped!" He immediately reported to the Gordon Road Patrol Station by telephone. When the police officers arrived, the bandits were gone. They investigated everything at the scene and then took the car driver Jiang Jintai and the main gatekeeper Chen Acheng to the patrol station to strictly interrogate the situation of their master being kidnapped and the appearance and clothing of the bandits, so as to find clues to apprehend the bandits.

The Reason for the Kidnapping; Under Investigation

According to the reporter's investigation, the distribution office of the factory is located at No. 228 Aiduya Road (i.e., the intersection of Sanyangjing Bridge and Jiangxi Road). Tong is good at drawing Chinese maps and is famous in the education field. He used to work in the Commercial Press and was in charge of drawing maps. He once served as a director of the Pudong Electric Company. The car No. 6369 that Tong usually rides is not his own car, but the official car of the Pudong Electric Company. Because Pudong fell after the war, the car was temporarily borrowed and has been used for three years. The factory was originally located in Gujiawan, Zhabei. After the two wars of "January 28" and "August 13", the losses were quite heavy. It then moved to its current address on Binlang Road. Recently, due to soaring raw material prices and sluggish sales, the factory's business has been hit hard. As for the reason for Tong's kidnapping, whether it is a simple kidnapping for ransom or related to political kidnapping, the patrol station is investigating.

### The Russian Team of the Merchant Corps is Being Merged; Deployment is Still Pending; After the Merger, the Team's Mission is Similar to the White Russian Team in the French Concession

The *Shanghai Times* reports that the Municipal Council's Economic Committee's interim report recommending the merger of the Russian Team of the Merchant Corps into the Police Department has been approved by the Council. However, according to senior officials of the Police Department, it is still unknown what the maintenance plan or funding of the Russian Team will be after it is merged into the Police Department. According to an official of the Municipal Council, the details of what kind of mission the Russian Team will undertake, what uniform it will wear, and whether it will continue to have rifles and bayonets on duty,

or be equipped with pistols

and other details have not been agreed upon. However, he believes that the main purpose of the Economic Committee's recommendation is to improve the efficiency of the Russian Team and the internal security of the International Settlement. On the one hand, it seeks movement, building a prison barracks on Xiamen Road, estimated to cost about 175,000 yuan. It will be at least four or five months before the new barracks are completed and the Russian Team moves from its current rented houses on the Bund and Jiujiang Road to the new barracks before it is merged into the Police Department. Regarding the uniform, there is no definite information, but it is believed that the members of the Russian Team will temporarily wear

the original military uniform

because it would cost a lot to make new uniforms for 300 people, which is not in line with the exchange policy. It is heard that after the Russian Team is merged into the Police Department, it will undertake a mission similar to that of the White Russian Auxiliary Team of the Police Department in the French Concession, and its salary will be the same as the amount it currently receives in the Merchant Corps. The complete plan for the future work of the Russian Team will be formulated by Police Commissioner Colonel Bao Wen after he returns to Shanghai from a short vacation. The Economic Committee's report states that members of the Russian Team will still have the same opportunity to be transferred to the Reserve Team in the future, and will be gradually trained and promoted. The police training work of the Russian Team will be the responsibility of Deputy Police Commissioner Robertson, who is in charge of the Reserve Team. The current officers of the Team will remain in their original positions.

### More Than 100 US Marines; Come to Shanghai to Relieve Troops; The Chaumont Sails to Beidaihe

The US Manpower Transport Ship Chaumont, which left the US San Diego Naval Base at the beginning of this month for its last Far East voyage, entered the port at 3:30 PM the day before yesterday and berthed at the US Navy pontoon in the Huangpu River. It also carried more than 100 US Marines to Shanghai to relieve the troops. They disembarked and boarded military vehicles to the US military camp for stationing that night. After mooring in Shanghai for one night, the ship set sail for Beidaihe in North China. On the 15th of next month, it will come again to carry the US Marines who have completed their service in Shanghai back to the United States.

### Mr. Chapalain, Director of the Shanghai Post Office; Departs to Return to Shanghai; The Mail Inspection in the French Concession; The Situation Will be Clear When Mr. Chapalain Arrives in Shanghai

Whether the incident of the Japanese side requesting to inspect mail at the post office branch in the French Concession can be resolved will be clear after Mr. Chapalain returns to Shanghai. According to the reporter of Datong News Agency, the Japanese side recently suddenly attempted to send inspectors to the Masnan Road Post Office branch in the French Concession for inspection, and it was scheduled that two Japanese inspectors would be accompanied by the bureau's patrolmen on the 23rd to inspect the residence of the Masnan Road Post Office. However, there was no result. Whether this matter will be implemented will be clear after Post Office Director Chapalain returns to Shanghai, and Mr. Chapalain has also departed from Hong Kong on the Taikoo Company's Yusheng Wheel yesterday and is expected to arrive around the 30th of this month. It is speculated that the Japanese side's motive for inspecting the mail at the Masnan Road Post Office is obviously to check the mail delivered by the branch itself within its area, because this mail does not go through the Administration Bureau but is delivered by the bureau itself. At the same time, the area delivered by the Masnan Road Post Office is much wider than other branches in the French Concession.

### Hong Kong's Preparedness is Still Strict; Overseas Chinese Form Self-Defense Corps; Guns Will be Issued to 5,000 People Nationwide; The Protection of Telecommunications Institutions in Hong Kong is Strict

The situation in Hong Kong has temporarily eased, but the authorities' preparedness has not been relaxed. According to a person from Hong Kong who spoke to a reporter from Pingming News Agency yesterday, the area is still in a state of war. Most of the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong have been evacuated. The interests of the Chinese are the most closely related, so they have agreed with the Hong Kong authorities to form a self-defense corps. The funding is raised by enthusiastic people. The entire corps has 5,000 members, all of whom are Chinese, and the Hong Kong authorities will issue self-defense guns to help maintain local law and order in emergency situations to make up for the shortage of police force. The organization is currently being prepared by leaders from all walks of life in Hong Kong.

(Protecting the Telegraph Bureau)

In addition, in order to prevent bad elements from breaking into the telecommunications institutions and attempting to sabotage them, the Hong Kong authorities have taken precautions for the Ministry of Communications, Great Eastern, and Great Northern Telegraph Bureaus. No outsiders are allowed to enter. Even those who go to send telegrams can only contact at the door and cannot directly enter the bureau as in the past.

(Intensifying Air Defense)

As for the authorities' air defense equipment, they are making active efforts. In addition to establishing an air defense class, where Chinese people and students from various schools go for training to meet the needs, the consulates of various countries and the important military and political institutions, as well as the large and small buildings concentrated on the mountains of Hong Kong, are all disguised with grass-green paint.

### A Large Gang of Bandits; Organize a Gun-Robbing Party; The Main Nest is Located in Caojiadu; Many Patrolmen's Guns Have Been Robbed

The English-language *China Press* reports that it has been heard that there are 80 to 100 bandits in the city who have formed a gang specializing in robbing patrolmen of their official guns for the purpose of robbing residents in the Western District. The Police Department of the International Settlement is aware of the existence of this bandit gang and believes that the bandits have a main nest near Caojiadu, off Jessfield Road. It has been investigated that in the past five months, no less than ten official guns of patrolmen on duty in Jessfield and its vicinity have been robbed, which is probably done by this bandit gang. Its main purpose is to confront the patrolmen of the International Settlement. The price of the robbed guns can be sold for more than 500 yuan, and the bandits can also keep the guns for their own use because there is a shortage of guns in Shanghai at the moment. It is believed that the various robbery cases that have occurred in the Jessfield area recently were committed by this bandit gang using the robbed official guns. In the past five months, the Jessfield bandits have only failed in one gun-robbing incident. This case occurred on Wednesday, when a Chinese patrolman was forced into ×× by bandits and his gun was robbed. Fortunately, the patrolman was alert, snatched back the gun, and injured a bandit. It is heard that the police authorities will officially commend the patrolman's bravery.

### Shooting Incident in Shanghai West; British Army Issues a Statement; Major Aishmore Checks the Soldiers' Guns and Ammunition; Proves on the Spot That Not a Single Bullet is Missing

The *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reports that just after 10:00 PM last night (the 26th), British military officers, police officers of the International Settlement Police Department, members of the Japanese Brigade, and important members of the "Municipal Police Bureau" arrived at the corner of Yidingpan Road and Da Xi Road to investigate an incident in which a "Municipal Police" officer on duty at the location claimed that a British sentry had fired four shots. The British military authorities last night

(Issued a Statement)

stated that according to the investigation conducted on the spot, none of the British soldiers on duty at the two posts there fired a gun. It can be seen that the "Municipal Police's" statement is completely groundless. This has satisfied both the Japanese Brigade and the officials of the "Municipal Police" Bureau. Previously, a "Municipal Police" officer on duty at the location pointed out that a British sentry had fired a gun. Several other "Municipal Police" officers echoed this. The commander of the British sentry team at the location

(Reported Immediately)

to the headquarters. Major Aishmore and several other British military officers, along with the Japanese Brigade of the Police Department and officials of the "Municipal Police" Bureau, arrived at the scene. It was pointed out that the British army at the location was not equipped with guns. Major Aishmore also checked the soldiers' guns and ammunition and saw that not a single bullet was missing. After the investigation was completed, the Japanese Brigade and officials of the "Municipal Police" Bureau expressed their belief that the British army had not fired a gun. According to people in the vicinity of the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Da Xi Road at about 10:00 PM last night, several gunshots were heard at the time, but it was believed that the shooting location was far from the intersection of the two roads.

### Xu Guansheng; Sued for Seduction; Ma Nangeng Also Sued for Forced Signing; Defendant Claims That the Plaintiff is a "Goddess"

Zhang Chen, a 61-year-old woman from Hangzhou, residing at No. 10 Haining Road, recently sued Xu Guansheng (35 years old, from South Zhao, residing at No. 44, Lane 383, Latour Road, currently the manager of South ×× Tobacco Company) and Ma Nangeng (31 years old, from Danyang, lawyer, No. 13, Bei Yongji Lane, Wangzhi Road) in the Criminal Court of the Special Court of the French Concession, accusing them of conspiring together to

(Abandon a Helpless Woman)

and attached a civil suit demanding 48,000 yuan in alimony. According to the complaint, Judge Tian Liweishan of the court opened a criminal court for trial yesterday afternoon. According to Zhang Chen, my niece Tang Wenying (20 years old this year) has died of her parents and is under my guardianship. Unexpectedly, she was seduced by Xu Guansheng and lost her chastity, and they cohabited. As a result, Xu falsely claimed to have signed a marriage certificate and tricked Wenying to Ma Nangeng's office, forcing her to sign a divorce paper. Therefore, I am suing the two defendants, requesting legal action. Then, according to Tang Wenying, in the 27th year of the Republic of China, I came to Hong Kong

to make a living

and happened to go shopping at the New World Company. I met Xu and was tricked into opening a room and lost my chastity. About a week later, we rented a house and cohabited. Recently, he made a new love and abandoned me. Therefore, my aunt came forward to file a lawsuit. Xu Guansheng confessed, In the spring of the 27th year of the Republic of China, I opened the Dajiang Hotel on Tianjin Road. A waiter introduced a business runner, Tang Wenying, to me and I stayed with her.

(Paid for the Night)

The next day, we parted ways. However, in June of that year, we met at the Wing On Company and rekindled our old relationship. She asked me to rent a house with her and we cohabited in various places such as No. 87, Shanjia Garden, Baker Road, and No. 7, Taichen Road Lane, Xiafei Road. I paid her more than 100 yuan per month for living expenses. On May 6 of this year, both parties voluntarily separated, so we signed a document at Lawyer Ma's office and I paid 600 yuan to settle the matter. The waiter of the Dajiang Hotel at that time and the second landlord of No. 87, Shanjia Garden, can prove that Wenying

(is indeed a goddess)

Finally, according to Ma Nangeng, this matter has nothing to do with me. Both parties voluntarily separated from their cohabitation relationship, so they asked me to make a contract and sign it in duplicate. There was no coercion. The court verified the words and decided to reschedule the hearing and summon ××.

### Rickshaw Puller Beats Passenger to Death; Puller Tries to Evade Responsibility

Han Lanqing, a 44-year-old Shanghai resident living at No. 5, Huai'an Fang, Pudong Road, Xujiahui, Shanghai West, hired Jiangbei native Tao Awu (35 years old, residing at No. 18, Shimin Village, Hongqiao Road) at the iron gate at the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Haige Road at 9:00 AM on the 26th. He hired Tao to pull his rickshaw to the Xujiahui Road tram station in Xujiahui Town for some business. Unexpectedly, Tao mistakenly thought that Han was going to take the tram to Shanghai, so he took a shortcut out of laziness, pulling the rickshaw through the iron gate and east along Route des Soeurs to the Yao Bishop Road tram station. From start to finish, the journey was only about thirty storefronts long. Han then argued with Tao, leading to a quarrel, which then escalated into a physical altercation. Tao punched Han once in the chest, causing internal injuries. Han collapsed to the ground. The police arrived and arrested Tao. Han was sent to Guangci Hospital but died before he could be treated. The body was sent to the Tongren Zhuan Yuan Mortuary for an autopsy. Yesterday, Prosecutor Zhao from the Special No. 2 Court was notified to examine the body, which confirmed that the death was caused by injuries sustained from the beating. Tao Awu confessed during the interrogation, saying, "The deceased slapped me in the face, and I raised my hand to block it, and he immediately fell down. I didn't hit him back." However, no family members of the deceased have come forward. The authorities have ordered the Benevolent Hall to handle the burial of the body. The defendant has been handed over by the police to be dealt with.

He reported it to Chinese Detective Chief Fan Defu, who, along with detectives Yang Zhaoxia and Cheng Renkun, arrested kidnappers Qin Guanxing, Wang Fu, and Lu Daoquan from Pudong on Avenue Edward VII. Another accomplice, Xie Yongsheng, fled into the sixth floor of the Pudong Fellow Association, changed his clothes, and attempted to blend in, but was still arrested by the detectives. After questioning, the location of the

Hidden Kidnapped Child

was found. Together with the detectives from the French Concession Police, they went to Room 26 of the Dongchang Hotel and rescued the kidnapped child Zhou Hongquan. They also arrested Sun Ada, a Wuxi native who was guarding the child, and brought them all to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Division of the Special No. 1 Court. Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the police station presented the case and requested permission for detention. Judge Feng ordered the five, including Xie Yongsheng, to be detained for further questioning in seven days.

### Russian Empress Ship to Arrive Tomorrow

The Russian Empress postal ship of the Changxing Company, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning, as reported in yesterday's newspaper, the company received a telegram yesterday stating that the ship departed from Vancouver, passing through Honolulu, Yokohama, and Kobe to Shanghai.

### Xiangmao Soap Factory Robbed; Employee Bravely Captures Thief; Follows Closely and Seizes Opportunity to Tackle Thief; Thief Fires One Shot, Fortunately Missing

At 3:40 PM yesterday, four robbers suddenly arrived at the office of the Chinese Xiangmao Soap Factory, No. 6, Hongren Lane, Tianjin Road. They broke in through the back door, threatened the factory employees with guns, forbidding them from making any noise, and locked them in a room, guarded by one robber with a gun. Another robber forced the employees to hand over the key to the cash box, opened it, and robbed more than 700 yuan in legal tender before fleeing. One of the employees, being quite resourceful, secretly followed the robbers. When they reached No. 505 and the entrance of the Jin Building near Xianbo Road on Henan Road, the employee bravely stepped forward and tackled one of the robbers. The robber pulled out a Mauser pistol and fired one shot, fortunately missing. At this critical moment, the employee bravely knocked the gun out of the robber's hand. The two then engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The employee's face was bitten by the robber, covered in blood, but he still held on firmly, shouting for help. When the nearby patrol officer heard the commotion and arrived, they immediately captured the robber alive, along with the Mauser pistol, and brought them to the police station for investigation.

### Letter

Dear Sir, I was surprised to read the news in your newspaper on July 27th about the alleged embezzlement by the assistant manager of the Tianquan Machinery Engineering Company. The company was dissolved as early as the first of this year. Mr. Geng, out of jealousy that Wen Jiang formed another company, has repeatedly tried to obstruct and hinder him, and has repeatedly reported the case to the police alleging encroachment. However, after Wen Jiang provided strong evidence, the police thoroughly investigated the false accusation and refused to accept it. Now, he has fabricated another incident and made a false accusation to the court. As for the statement in your newspaper that "the evidence submitted by the defendant in court was found to be untrue," it is not in accordance with the facts. The allegations made by the plaintiff and the evidence provided by the defendant are sufficient to prove that the plaintiff knew that the allegations were false and untrue, and had the suspicion of deliberately framing the defendant, so it is necessary to summon witnesses to prove the case. Right and wrong will be determined by the court. This matter is of great importance to my business and reputation, so I am writing this letter to request a correction in your newspaper.

Sincerely,

Sun Wenjiang

July 27, 1940

### The American Summer

— Translated from the New York Times by Bo Ming

People all over the world undoubtedly consider the power and resources of the United States to be second to none. However, they cannot help but have some doubts about the nerves of Americans. The American in their minds is simply someone who, all day long, does nothing but "make money," without a moment's rest, like a headless fly, flying around everywhere.

In fact, these impressions are completely superficial and come either from newspapers or books, or from fleeting glimpses during travels to the United States, seeing only the extremely tense emotions of Americans in a few big cities. As for worshipping money and seeking wealth, it is human nature, but after the American Civil War, the idea of "getting rich quick" became stronger among Americans. At that time, many "adventurers" built fortunes from scratch, becoming millionaires. Europeans, after reading their autobiographies, biographies, or anecdotes, naturally felt that these people were just money-grubbing, reckless types.

In reality, the leisurely enjoyment and natural ease of Americans have been gradually improving over the past five or six decades, and there has been a significant transformation in their social life. Just considering their summer life, it has changed from a change in climate to a change in psychology.

Economic development and educational advancement are two factors that have caused major changes in American summer life. Since the evolution of summer hotels and summer clubs, the activity increases almost every summer. Over the years, American society has become increasingly prosperous, and most people can afford a car, transforming it from a luxury item for a few to a necessity for the masses. As a result, the most important travel tool has become a common possession in every household. Mountains and watersides, as long as there are scenic spots, can be reached from morning to night, almost without limit. Those who used to view travel as a nuisance can now do as they please and never tire of it.

Travel can increase knowledge, change the environment, and is the only way to absorb various new materials. As a result, many people use this long summer vacation to catch up on their studies and increase their knowledge, especially students and university professors, who use the good environment and extra time to engage in education and academic cultivation.

The American summer is quite long. From the end of June to the beginning of September, three months of summer vacation can be used for traveling, relaxing in the mountains, by the water, or in small rural villages. As long as you have a car and some money, you are qualified to move to the countryside. Because of social prosperity and industrial development, the increase in personal assets and leisure time has led middle-class Americans to start having two homes to adapt to their annual lifestyle. Surprisingly, during the economic downturn from 1929 to 1932, this comfortable lifestyle was not affected. On the contrary, tens of millions of unemployed people spent most of the year living in rural areas or cabins in the forests, which actually saved on expenses.

Summer life is diverse, ranging from individuals to groups, each differing according to environmental conditions. There are families where the head of the household works at a university. Frugal families, during the summer months when school is out, and the husband has nothing to do, will get a flat-bottomed boat, load it with daily necessities, hoist a sail, and slowly cruise on the inner lake, all the way to a secluded island to spend the summer. Only when the autumn wind blows, and the frost falls on the leaves, do they return to the city. There is also a lady who works for a publishing company. Her actual vacation time in the summer is very short, only about two weeks. Every Saturday afternoon and any day she is free, she parks her car in front of the door and drives away, going wherever she pleases, until dusk, when she finds lodging in an inn. Ladies and women who are accustomed to social life, who used to frequent dazzling and extravagant places from 10:00 PM to 12:00 AM, are also idle in the summer. They are often found in the kitchens of village houses or in mountain gardens, doing gardening work.

There are two special features of American summer life that go hand in hand with cars, property, and leisure time, becoming a unique situation in summer life anywhere in the world. The first is children's summer camps, which have a long history and have become a national industry. If you include the number of Boy Scouts camping, at least two million American children participate in this kind of summer camp life every year. According to a 1933 survey, there are no fewer than 3,485 such organizations nationwide. Their locations are either by the water or in the forest, lasting from six to eight weeks. Originally, these beautiful environments and good facilities, such as lakeside and mountainside huts, and the leisurely life of fishing yachts, were only enjoyed by the wealthy children whose fathers and brothers were rich. Now, middle-class families can also enjoy this blessing by paying a small fee. On the one hand, after parents send their children to summer camps, experts will manage them, without them having to worry about it themselves. On the other hand, the couple can spend a few happy weeks in the countryside or faraway villages without any burdens.

The rapid increase in children's summer camps is certainly related to the growth of the social economy, but it is not simply due to the pursuit of leisure and enjoyment. In recent years, many middle-class families have moved from the countryside to the cities to make a living. In the summer, the children are still stuck in high-rise buildings of twenty or thirty stories or running around in the streets and alleys, and neither their bodies nor minds benefit. As a result, the summer camp business has sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain.

The second feature is summer schools. The scope of these summer schools is very wide, ranging from formal university courses to writing or dance schools set up on mountaintops or in pine forests. All kinds of education are available, too numerous to mention. Now, more and more young children are going to university, so they certainly cannot let this good summer pass in vain. They must take advantage of the opportunity to get their children more education. On the one hand, because the social and economic situation has improved, sixteen-year-old youths of school age no longer need to do odd jobs in the summer to subsidize their tuition. As a result, the need for summer schools is more developed than in previous years. As for adults, many people who have no free time throughout the year can take advantage of this opportunity to use the beautiful environment to catch up on their favorite or needed subjects. Therefore, in essence, the so-called summer school is just a collective that combines rest, education, work, and society into one.

American summer life occupies a very important position psychologically. As Europeans have witnessed, any American city is filled with tense and urgent emotions, all kinds of noises, constantly intertwined telephones and telegrams, middle-aged women's busy social lives, young mothers' painstaking efforts to find everything beneficial for their children, the tense situation of door-to-door salesmen, the sharp cries of newspaper vendors, and the stimulating scenes in movies—how can such a life not make people's heads swell and their nerves extremely tense? However, Americans have their own plans. When they are busy, they really cannot breathe, but the pursuit of leisurely summer vacations and reclusive lives is also superior to others. Out of the twelve months of the year, they actually only work hard for nine months, and the remaining three months are this leisurely summer life. Most middle-class people, especially urban residents, after nine months of long-term struggle, have more than twenty weeks of rest. The fact that Americans' nerves can be kept normal is certainly largely due to this summer life.

In the nineteenth century, European writers and Americans themselves agreed that Americans' nerves were extremely tense and becoming weak. Just look at the appearance of Uncle Sam, with his long face and pointed chin—this is a sign of neurasthenia. But today's Americans have changed from that dry and tense long face to a rosy and round face. The thin faces of women have also become much broader and fuller. Although there are still many advertisements for medicines on the market to treat colic and constipation, these diseases are no longer a concern for Americans.

Europeans who travel to the United States rarely stay for a long time in the summer, so they only see the tense emotions of Americans, but they do not get to experience the wonderful summer life. The leisure of summer really has some poetry in it. Even taking driving as an example, driving through the fields in the summer, going up and down a hillside slowly, with white clouds overhead, and the countryside full of fun, when he stops, he can fully appreciate the wind and scenery between the fields and forests. Even for women, during this season, because heavy makeup is too hot, they naturally wear some light clothes. They don't play cards or listen to lectures, they just do some comfortable and natural daily life.

The most prosperous New York originally had no so-called vacation, but when summer comes, the scene also changes greatly, like a woman who is in love, her clothes, appearance, and demeanor, there is no place that is not changed. At midday, the streets already have a leisurely look. Cars on the elevated Park Avenue are only quiet and peaceful, and they do not roar. Children on the sidewalk are alone and grand, as if they were the owners of the place. Doormen are only wearing undershirts, sitting on the stones along the street to rest. Clerks in department stores are too lazy to even sort out their clothes. Most women are leaning on the window, listless.

When summer comes, Americans become the most carefree and natural people. Without fatigue, without aging, restoring vitality, maintaining youth, and dispelling the tense emotions of winter, they are preparing to welcome the new world of early autumn. As long as they see a red maple leaf and hear a cricket chirping, the energy that Americans have restored and stored in the long summer will begin to move forward on the path of endless life.

### German Tanks and Their Tactics

The second weapon of the new German tactics, namely the concentrated attack of tanks, is, like the development of its air force, also a product of recent years. General Velpry, former Director of Armored Forces in France, once said, "There has been no progress in tanks and their use for fifteen years! This is because Germany has no such weapon."

Although this statement may be an overstatement for the German military authorities, it only reveals a portion of the truth. Because the German army was not allowed to use tanks for fifteen years, during which only a few prototypes were built, this also meant that they were not bound by traditional tactics. Once the time was right, they could do as they pleased. By 1933, they were able to develop the various powers of tanks according to a completely innovative plan.

The armies of other countries, especially the French army, still view tanks as auxiliary weapons for infantry, so they continue to be bound by the pace of infantry, and tank units are evenly distributed to the army. The new German army is different. From the beginning, it decided to remove the shackles on tanks, break them away from auxiliary weapons, and make them independent weapons, forming powerful divisions, purely with concentrated and rapid special power, breaking through enemy lines and turning the entire battle into a mobile war.

In the first few years of German military restructuring, they concentrated on the mass production of light tanks, following the precedents of the Soviet Union and Italy. These tanks weighed six tons, were equipped with two machine guns, had armor less than six-tenths of an inch thick, and had a speed of 35 miles per hour.

These tanks, in the Spanish Civil War, encountered the government army's weak anti-tank guns and slightly heavier Soviet tanks, and the results were very poor. The Germans learned from this lesson and completely changed their strategy. The result was seen on April 20, 1938, at Hitler's birthday parade, when new light tanks weighing eight or ten tons had been created. In addition to machine guns, they were also equipped with an eight-millimeter cannon. Another type of medium tank weighed 18 to 25 tons and was equipped with a 1.5-inch or 1-inch cannon, with five soldiers per vehicle.

At the same time, the German Krupp factory was also testing a giant tank weighing 100 tons, equipped with one 4-inch cannon and two 3-inch cannons, 12 to 15 machine guns, 19 soldiers, and armor about 4 inches thick. The two giant tanks created by the Germans in 1918 can be compared. These tanks weighed 150 tons, were equipped with four 3-inch cannons, two machine guns, 22 soldiers, and armor less than 2 inches thick, and were never used by the Germans.

Currently, German war teams are based on the above three types. In 1935, three divisions were formed. By the end of 1938, this had expanded to five heavy mechanized divisions, each division with two tank regiments, each with 200 tanks, supplemented by motorized infantry, artillery, engineers, signalmen, and supply troops. By the time of the Polish War, the number had increased to at least six divisions. Currently, it has increased to 12 divisions, with a total of about 5,000 tanks, including 500 heavy tanks, 2,000 medium tanks, and 2,500 light tanks. In addition, there are so-called "fast divisions," the number of which is unknown, each with 100 light tanks, supplemented by armored vehicles, motorcycles, motorized artillery vehicles, and motorized infantry. These "fast divisions" are used to replace the cavalry of the past.

The victory of the German tank units in Poland and France was partly due to the power of the giant heavy tanks, but the main reason was the special training of the German army in extremely sensitive tactics, which were developed by the army into concentrated attacks and large-scale tactics. This kind of tactics can only be used freely by a large standing army that has received systematic training in peacetime, and can never be carried out by independent tank units and auxiliary teams combined?

Tanks must not only destroy machine guns, as they did in the last war, but also destroy anti-tank guns and other anti-tank weapons, such as mines and obstacles. Therefore, the formation of tanks during an attack is quite complicated and must be divided into several successive batches, each with special tasks and objectives. The first batch is the heaviest tanks, used to break through the enemy's important gaps and positions. The second batch is medium tanks, which are the main force of the attack. Their special task is to destroy the enemy's anti-tank guns, and they must use the terrain to drive forward quickly, and if possible, also use pincers to attack from both sides or the front and rear. The third batch is mostly light tanks, mixed with a small number of medium tanks. Their main task is to destroy the enemy's machine guns, so that infantry and special motorized artillery teams and other troops can follow.

Although this tactic focuses on speed and surprise, its purpose is not only to rush through the enemy's formation, but its most important thing is to break the enemy's resistance with superior firepower. When German tanks clash with enemy tanks, their tactics focus on the most important point, that is, first aim and fire at the enemy tanks. According to the experience of the last war, this point has been proven to determine victory or defeat. After German tanks successfully attack enemy tanks with firepower, they begin to advance. In other words, they use firepower control, action adjustment, and use all their strength to pounce on the enemy's weaknesses, seize local advantages, and try to defeat the enemy.

Tanks are mainly based on concentrated attacks, and other various troops are in an auxiliary position and must be used selectively and at the right time. However, the cooperation of aircraft is very important. Aircraft can assist tank commanders in reconnaissance of the terrain from the air, and bombard and strafe the enemy army to assist the first batch of tanks in combat, and can also deal with enemy air counterattacks and assist tanks in pursuit.

This kind of mobile warfare has a great impact on the individual tactics and strategies of the German army. On the one hand, German infantry is different from that of France and the Soviet Union. The other countries have received strict training, and they can use their own heavy weapons without the assistance of tanks, so that tanks can concentrate their attacks. On the other hand, this kind of concentrated attack, that is, the main force of the attack with heavy tank teams attached to motorized infantry, is definitely different from the main force attack with infantry alone. The German army's sweeping advance in the Western Front this time is clear evidence of this.

### Old News Re-copied Sixty-Seven Years Ago (458) (See Original Newspaper from the Twelfth Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Desolate Qing Dynasty)

A Song of Encouraging Relief

Natural disasters occur, in every dynasty and country. The states of Lu, Wei, Yan, and Qi occasionally reported famine. It breaks my heart to see the people of Jin suffer, why must Heaven burden them alone? The drought is severe, and the good harvests have been long gone. The fields are without green grass, and nine out of ten homes are empty. People have faces like cranes, and the fields are as barren as tortoise shells. Gold is like dirt, yet it's hard to exchange for even a little grain. Who weeps in the rooms? Young children and old men. Who weeps on the roads? Maidens and widows. Husbands cannot protect their wives, and children are separated from their mothers. Empty stomachs lead to collapse, and hunger gnaws at the intestines. People eat human flesh to stave off hunger, and plaster their mouths with stone powder. Starved corpses line the roads, one doesn't know how to handle it. And it is reported that this year, whether rain will come is unknown. Spring planting is all withered, and the autumn harvest cannot be relied upon. Looking back at the regions of Jiang and Han, accumulated rice forms mountains. In years of prosperity, everyone is joyous, grains are abundant. But few good people are afraid of lagging behind in disaster relief. Don't delay, quickly prepare grain and dried provisions. Performing good deeds brings blessings, this theory is not flawed. Burying a snake and saving an ant, one can gain fame. The Sui pearl and jade rings, their rewards can be seen. Burning bonds and buying righteousness, tying grass to repel invaders. These examples are recorded in history books, countless and clear. How much more so for the disaster-stricken people, the merit lies in saving them. In June, frost flies, and there is no rain for three years. I urge the governing officials, making righting wrongs your priority. The Golden Valley is turned to ruins, and the Copper Mountain remains only as earth. I urge those with wealth, what difficulty is there in opening your purse? The benevolence of a gentleman, it extends for five generations. Human life is only a hundred years, who can be like Peng Zu? Looking back at your descendants, they may be like dogs or tigers. Only blessings can be planted, only virtue can be established. Secret blessings bring good fortune, and the gods will surely compensate. Don't imitate the money-grubbers, who only know how to hoard. Just look at natural disasters, how can much gold cure them? It breaks my heart to see the people of Jin, hundreds of thousands of households. Saving from disaster is an urgent matter, do not sneer at the foolish and simple.

Calligraphy: Good Friends Help Each Other

Advanced Level

Composition: Hometown

Calligraphy: Be a Dignified Chinese Person

Composition Topic Guidance

My Teacher: There is more than one teacher, so be sure to write the teacher's name and the subjects they teach. The most important thing is to clearly describe the teacher's personality, and to write your feelings about them sincerely, but do not criticize them. As for the order of arrangement, you can choose freely, but the entire article should have a few concluding remarks, either general first then specific, or specific first then general, either way is fine. If you particularly admire a certain teacher, you can focus on that one, with the others as supporting characters. This kind of writing is more difficult.

Hometown: This topic is best to expand on. In addition to writing the location, name, and local customs, you can make a comparison between before and after the war. If you haven't been back, you can inquire from relatives and friends, and then write your feelings. Your hometown is where you were born, so the relationship is very close, and the feelings you write will surely be moving.

### Overcoming the Darkness

Children, hurry up and go to sleep! It's getting late. "Mom, I'm scared." Every night, countless children are saying, "Mom? I'm scared." Afraid of what? Afraid of the darkness. So children who are innocent and carefree during the day, when they go to sleep at night, or when they need to get something, they have to be accompanied, and are unwilling to go alone. Children, why do you have such a mysterious and unpredictable attitude towards darkness? Why is the fear of darkness even more severe than the harsh words of teachers or the beatings of parents? What exactly is the reason? I will now divide it into two points: First, in childhood, things are fun, and children often don't want to go to sleep. Even if they are forced to go to bed, they toss and turn and refuse to close their eyes. So the mother or maid scares you by saying, "If you don't sleep, the tiger will come." Or other things you are usually afraid of. You immediately believe it to be true, and are forced to fall asleep. After this happens once or twice, a terrible shadow is etched in the child's small mind. Because these frightening words are all said at bedtime, so every time you lie in bed and can't sleep, you think of tigers! Terrible people! The more you think about it, the more scared you become, looking around, all is pitch black, and you can't help but feel your hair stand on end, gradually developing a timid mentality. Second, in the evening, the family members are all free, so they chat about everything, especially liking to talk about demons and ghosts. Children who hear this become suspicious and fearful. Because in the darkness they cannot clearly see the outlines of objects, occasionally hearing a sound or mistaking an object, they mistakenly think it is a ghost. Parents also think that being afraid of the dark is a child's nature, and without waiting for the child to ask, they accompany them early on, constantly suggesting the terribleness of the darkness, without even realizing it themselves. This feeling of being afraid of the dark is deeply rooted in the minds of young children, and is not removed until they are fourteen or fifteen years old. By the time they are around twenty years old, they still don't dare to go alone to empty places. The creation of this fear weakens the courage of children and buries the spirit of independence.

Children! How can we overcome the darkness, how can we drive out the shadows in our minds? The most effective method is to ask grandmothers and mothers to stop telling ghost stories to avoid harming younger siblings. The proactive method is to personally observe the things that we find suspicious. For example, in the darkness, it seems that we see something white. At that time, you don't have to run away, turn on the light and go to that place to look, and you will know that what is hanging there is a white piece of clothing or a piece of cloth. Your doubts will immediately disappear. After a long time, you don't need to turn on the light. As soon as you hear a sound, you will guess that it is a mouse gnawing on something, and you will no longer be suspicious and fearful.

The latter method is very difficult at first, so you may want to ask someone to accompany you to observe. After your own experience increases, you will know that ghosts don't exist, your doubts will disappear, your courage will be strengthened, and you won't be afraid of anything. Children who are afraid of the dark, try this method!

### Two Teapots

— Jin Zhen

It's so hot! As soon as they finished breakfast, Ah Hui's mother took him and his brother, Ah Ming, to visit relatives, because the morning was relatively cooler. If they went out in the afternoon, the sun would be as scary as a man-eating tiger. After a short stay at the relative's house, they planned to start their journey home.

His mother conveniently bought a teapot for making tea on the way, which caused a debate between the Ah Hui brothers.

The thing is this: They stepped into the pottery shop and saw at a glance that various teapots were placed in the corner of the display window, and two of them were of the same width, but one was tall and one was short, but their spouts were the same height. After all, which teapot can hold more water? This question became the starting point of their argument.

"Undoubtedly, the taller teapot can definitely hold more water. If you don't believe me, go call the boss in the store and ask him which one is more expensive? The taller one must be more expensive, because it can hold more water." Ah Hui said incessantly, seemingly very reasonable, and the boss's reply made Ah Hui's claim even more solid, truly adding fuel to the fire, so the reason could be established, and Ah Hui's victory was determined.

"No need to argue strongly, let's use facts to prove whether I'm right or you're right?" Ah Ming also refused to give in, and he already had a plan in mind. He put the two teapots flat on the table and asked the boss to bring a basin of water. He also took a teacup, filled it with water, and poured it into the two teapots. He first poured water into the lower one, and as the water gradually filled, he continued to pour it into the taller one. Just as the water was about to reach the mouth of the teapot, Ah Hui saw the water overflowing from the spout, so he poured the water out of the two teapots, and the result truly made Ah Hui dumbfounded.

"The fact is like this. Next time, you can't just make such careless remarks without thinking and think you're very certain. Now you know why it doesn't match your ideal? When you pour water into the taller teapot, you can only pour it to the limit of the teapot's spout. If you pour in more, the water will overflow from the spout, because the spouts of the two teapots are the same height. So the lower teapot is indeed the same height as the spout, and a teapot that is any larger can hold the same amount of water. Whether in the teapot or in the spout, the water is always on the same level. If the spout is only this high, then no matter how tall the body of the teapot is, you can't fill the body with water, because once it's full, the water will overflow from the spout, so the water capacity of a teapot only depends on how high its spout is. This is completely a matter of level."

### Shirley Temple's Autobiography (12)

Gokan, let me tell you about my work in the Education Film Corporation short films. The first film was "So Glorious," which was filmed in the summer of 1932. I was only three years old then. Mother took me to the studio. She wasn't as excited as she was at my first screen test, but she was very happy in her heart. Although she was calm on the surface and didn't show anything, I knew that she had always hoped that I would enter the film industry. Now that her wish had been fulfilled, how could she not be happy? And I guessed that when she was a little girl, she herself would have liked to enter the film industry.

In this first film, I had very few lines, only about twelve lines, and half of them were in French. All I did was a song and dance, shaking my shoulders to the rhythm of the music, and rolling my eyes as if making flirtatious glances. My body was also like the female star Doris Lee Elio, who wore a short mesh shirt in "So Glorious" and exposed one shoulder.

But do you know what I did in the film? I actually kissed two boys, something I had never done before in my life. And not just one, but two boys! So you can't say I didn't have any lovers. Those two boys, one named Erqi En Bader, and the other named George Smith, were both around four years old. Although they were still wearing diapers, they were both very handsome. They both wanted to marry me, and I immediately agreed after kissing them. But I don't know what they are doing now, because we haven't met since we parted in that film.

Since that film, I have also performed many love scenes. As soon as I saw Miss Denon, I fell in love with him. I played the main role in the great film "Stand Up and Cheer," and he was also in it. As soon as he saw me, he also fell in love with me. According to him, he loved me more than any other woman in the world. I believe him, do you believe him too? One day, in front of my mother, he picked me up and kissed me!

Next was Mr. Leon Barrymore, whom I also loved. He played an old soldier in my film "The Little Colonel." Actually, he himself wasn't that old, so he wore a snow-white wig. Although I liked him in my heart, I didn't dare to say it out loud, for fear that the old man would frown at me. I asked my mother what I should do. My mother said it didn't matter. If he heard that I liked him, he might be very happy. So I waited for an opportunity to explain it to him.

Anecdotes of the Peking Opera World

### Two Anecdotes about Tan Xinpei Zhongheyuan Angrily Beats Prince Qing Entertaining the Court, Teasing Lang Deshan

In the late Guangxu period of the desolate Qing Dynasty, Tan Xinpei, the owner of Yingshutang, established the Tongqing troupe in the Zhongheyuan inside Qianmenwai Liangliangdian, and its business was booming, becoming the champion of various gardens. One day, Prince Qing, accompanied by his family, went to Zhongheyuan to watch a play. It happened that the garden was extremely popular that day, and when the prince arrived, all the seats in the upper floors had been reserved. Even a small box was impossible to find. The prince was very disgruntled and forcibly occupied the box of another guest and sat down. The staff argued with him, but he refused to listen and ordered his soldiers to beat them severely. At this time, Tan was putting on makeup backstage, and he became furious when he heard the news. He refused to show weakness and led the crowd to fight back, injuring the soldiers and Prince Qing. Knowing that he was no match for the crowd, the prince staggered back to his mansion. He was still angry and immediately issued an order to seal Zhongheyuan without permission to vent his anger. The next day, Empress Dowager Cixi summoned Tan to perform in the palace. Tan refused to go, which shocked the Empress Dowager. She quickly ordered an official to inquire at Tan's house. Tan told him about the events of last night. The official truthfully reported back to the Empress Dowager. The Empress Dowager said, "How can the Prince be so unreasonable?" She then ordered a courtier to summon the Prince and reprimanded him. On the other hand, she sent someone to comfort Tan and sent Han Dalaoye, the commander of the Nine Gates, to personally unseal Zhongheyuan at two o'clock that evening with lanterns lighting the way. Only then did Tan dress up and enter the palace to thank the Empress Dowager. When the Empress Dowager saw Tan, she comforted him with gentle words and criticized the Prince's actions. From then on, Tan Beile's prestige spread throughout the nine cities and became unmatched. Chen Shitou personally told me about this incident before he died.

At that time, the Jing performer Lang Deshan was like a newly unsheathed blade, shining brightly and very famous. One day, he was paired with Tan Xinpei in the inner court to perform "Catching and Releasing Cao," and his skills were evenly matched, and his reputation was excellent. Tan was quick-witted and knew that Lang was a Muslim, so he suddenly changed "Killing a Pig to Sell Wine" to "Killing an Ox to Sell Wine." Empress Dowager Cixi was very surprised. After the play was over, she summoned Tan to inquire. Tan replied, "Lang is a Hui person and does not eat pork, so I replaced it with beef." The Empress Dowager was very pleased to hear this and praised him greatly. That day's main performance was Tan's "Stealing the Soul Bell." Before going on stage, Tan said to the crowd, "Please all of you sing with me in this play, so we can receive rewards from the Empress Dowager later." All the famous actors gladly agreed and played the role of Pigsy, and Lang was no exception. When Pigsy ordered the little pigs to cry out, the others all made pig noises, but Lang made a goat bleating sound. Tan shouted, "My little pig can bleat like a goat." The Empress Dowager was greatly amused and rewarded them generously. This is also one of the anecdotes of Yingshu's offering to the inner court.

### The Cast of Meng Lijun

A Mr. from Guohua Company said: "Meng Lijun" may have Spring Bright's production first, but our efforts and resources invested in this film exceed any Guohua production before. When it is released, it should have excellent returns. For example, the cast includes Zhou Xuan, Shu Shi, Xu Feng, Ji Jianong, You Guangzhao, Yuan Shaomei, Zhou Qi, etc., which is also unprecedented in Guohua productions. Therefore, when this film is released, it should be refreshing. (The picture above is one of the scenes in the film)

### Fei Mu and Ying Yin Oppose Joining the China United Film Factory to Make Movies

Ying Yin has been in Shanghai for half a year, and recently she seems to have become silent. It is said that the greatest expectation of Hezhong for Ying Yin is to star in "Empress Dowager Cixi," but the script has not been completely finished. Hezhong is unwilling to let Ying Yin be revealed before discovering a script more moving than "Empress Dowager Cixi." It is said that Fei Mu had already been hired as the director of the film, but Fei Mu said that he was unwilling to join the China United Stone Factory to work. Therefore, once "Empress Dowager Cixi" starts filming, if a new location is not found, the director cannot be easily changed. It is generally believed that this is a loss for Ying Yin's future.

### Li Qinian's Activities

Li Qinian has been in Shanghai for many days. Because she needs to rest after the tonsillectomy, she is temporarily staying at the Jinmen Hotel and has not yet gone to the studio to work. According to her, she has only seen "The Old House of Suspicion" at the Grand Theater since arriving in Shanghai. She plans to see "Gone with the Wind" next week. Although this film was continuously shown in Singapore for a month, it had just finished showing when she arrived there from Hong Kong to perform in a charity performance, so she never saw it. She has also scheduled to go to the Xuangong Theater next Tuesday night to see the stage play "Li Xiangjun." It is said that Yihua Company has reserved a row of seats that night to watch Tang Ruoqing's play. Qinian and Ruoqing are still good friends.

Hawthorn Case

### The Dancer's Ending

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Four: Several Guesses

Ni Jinshou suddenly interjected as if he had thought of something, "But after the case, the window and curtains were open."

"Yes, maybe she opened it after the guests left, or even if the guests didn't leave, she knew that Lao Mao was asleep and there was no danger, so she pushed the window open. Because she had been in this room for a while, and I guess the nature of their conversation must have been very brain-intensive, so it would be natural for her to open the window to let in some air. I also know that this guest stayed in this room for a considerable amount of time, so the footprints he left when he went out are very minimal."

I also interjected, "Yes, the footprints of this person are what we identified as 'B'. There are also two clear rows that we identified as 'A'. Judging from the level of the prints, the time that the 'B' prints entered was indeed before the 'A' prints. Although these 'B' prints overlapped with the 'A' prints when entering, I found a few complete ones, but I only found one complete 'B' print when going out, and it was very faint."

Ni Jinshou nodded and said, "Yes, but the entry and exit of the 'A' prints are very clear. Are you saying that after the person with the 'B' prints left, a second person with 'A' prints came in?"

Hawthorn suddenly frowned and replied, "Yes, but there is a prerequisite problem here. Was this 'A' print guest also someone the deceased had an appointment with? Or was his arrival unexpected? And one more thing, since the person with the 'B' prints stayed in this room for a long time, and Wang Yaolan seemed to be very flattering to him, then why didn't she see him out when he left? Furthermore, even if she didn't see him off and it was inconvenient to disturb Lao Mao, she should have gone out to lock the door herself. But her shoe prints clearly tell us that she never walked out again after entering this room last night. Why? Is it because she was really waiting for a second 'A' print guest after letting the 'B' print guest leave, so there was no need to rush out to lock the door? Or did the 'A' print guest happen to come in just as the 'B' print guest was leaving, so she no longer needed to go out?"

I interjected, "Maybe the 'B' print guest was the murderer. She couldn't see him off because she was already dead when he left."

Hawthorn didn't answer, but looked at the carpet, frowning tightly, appearing to be lost in thought. Ni Jinshou also looked the same way. After a while, he also suggested, "Maybe this 'A' print guest was the murderer. He shot Wang Lilan as soon as he came in, and then took her jewelry and ran out. Mr. Hawthorn, do you think this conjecture is possible?" (58)
