Editorial

### Eliminating Black Market Trading in Rice

The rice market is faltering as if stricken by apoplexy. Recently, the high points of seventy yuan for foreign rice and eighty yuan for japonica rice have been reached, representing a five-fold increase over pre-war prices. An investigation of the city's rice reserves, excluding those held by rice shops and households, reveals that warehouses alone hold a substantial 635,000 bags. Furthermore, the autumn harvest in various regions is good, and new grains are arriving at the port in a continuous stream of large and small ships. Yet, such unprecedentedly high prices have been created. If this is not due to unscrupulous merchants hoarding and manipulating the market, what else could it be?

Originally, the intention was to stabilize rice prices and prevent manipulation by the black market. The solution was thought to be centralized buying and selling, public pricing, and market management, which would bring stability to rice prices. However, the pricing method has been accommodating and lax, while centralized management has remained largely symbolic. Even when rice prices have fallen repeatedly, the official prices have remained stubbornly high. And as rice prices have risen again and again, the official prices have been repeatedly adjusted upward. Although at times, under the pressure of public opinion, there have been proclamations of maintaining the original pricing, the black market has been allowed to exceed the official price by eight or nine yuan without any intervention. This makes it clear that the official pricing is knowingly allowing manipulation. Truly, seeking price stabilization with unscrupulous merchants is like seeking the skin of a tiger. If the law were strictly enforced without leniency, would those who commit illegal acts not know that they would be punished for violating the law? It is only because the authorities are accommodating and lenient, and because the common interests of the industry are shared, that no one is willing to break the code of silence or report truthfully and enforce the law impartially. Sharing profits and colluding in wrongdoing have become an open secret. The so-called supervisory and corrective responsibilities, the so-called power to discipline, are all but smoke screens to deceive the public, allowing unscrupulous merchants to act with impunity and commit their crimes.

The greatest failure of the current pricing scheme is that it follows the same path as the price controls on japonica rice. At that time, there were price controls on japonica rice but not on foreign rice. When the price of foreign rice skyrocketed, the wall of restrictions on japonica rice collapsed without a single attack. Rice merchants must have used a threatening rhetoric, arguing that uniform price restrictions would deter those purchasing foreign rice, further depleting supplies and intensifying panic. Therefore, they insisted on a double standard, with leniency on one side and strictness on the other, to avoid shortages. As a result, only japonica rice was restricted, while foreign rice was left unregulated. Little did they know that any "exceptions" in the regulatory measures would lead to a proliferation of abuses. The eventual demise of japonica rice price controls was precisely due to the discriminatory nature of the price control measures. Today, the pricing scheme is again limited to foreign rice, neglecting japonica and domestic rice, and ignoring the black market as if it were non-existent. Are they unaware that the Shanghai Municipal Council's announcement of japonica rice price controls has not been explicitly revoked? Exploiting loopholes and manipulating the law, they operate within the system while pretending not to intentionally undermine the authority of the authorities. As for their own selfish and self-serving pricing, they seem to adhere to it and adapt it as needed. They openly and brazenly engage in black market trading without any restraint. How could it have come to this? The pricing method is not inherently flawed in principle, but it is not implemented effectively.

I believe that the authorities, for the sake of the millions of residents in the city, for the sake of the overall market, and for the sake of security, should investigate hidden loyalties, make a firm decision, and engage in eliminating the black market, stabilizing rice prices, and regulating the food supply. They should understand that this cannot be achieved by holding a few meetings and making a few speeches. What is needed is a policy, a plan, the appointment of capable individuals, the granting of real power, the encouragement of action, and the assignment of responsibility. A systematic organization should be created to coordinate the overall interests. If efforts are made piecemeal, or are inconsistent, or follow old routines and are perfunctory and irresponsible, then the dire consequences will not be far off, and it will be more than just a hidden danger.

### Negotiations on the Issue of Passage Through Vietnam are Deadlocked; US States Japan Will Encounter Difficulties; Germany Also Does Not Approve

Hong Kong. The Chongqing Ta Kung Pao today quoted a diplomatic source as saying that the Vichy government has agreed to the Japanese request to allow Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam. The newspaper reported that the French government instructed Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux to conduct detailed consultations with Japanese Major General Nishihara. The condition for Japanese troops passing through Vietnam is that they not exceed half of the French troops. However, Tokyo is requesting that 60,000 Japanese troops be allowed to pass through, as well as the hiring of local labor and the use of Vietnamese airfields. Governor-General Decoux rejected the Japanese demands, and negotiations are continuing in deadlock. At the same time, the Ta Kung Pao stated that Vietnam remains extremely friendly to the Chongqing government and would welcome Chinese troops if the Japanese attack Vietnam. (Dispatch of the 13th, International News Service)

Washington. Today's report from Hanoi that the French-Japanese conference has been suspended indefinitely is consistent with the view held here that Japanese troops invading China via Vietnam will encounter significant resistance. Although, the possibility of a French-Japanese agreement, whether formal or tacit, has not been completely ruled out by diplomatic circles. As for the Japanese attempting to carry out significant military operations via Vietnam, this is not surprising here. However, it is widely believed that the Japanese will face many difficulties in practice, as the roads are rugged and the railways are limited. As a result, they will inevitably encounter Chinese resistance. Secretary of State Hull has stated that the United States is very concerned about this, not only because of its diplomatic stance, but also because the United States obtains significant raw materials from Vietnam or transships them through Vietnam. For example, Chinese tung oil, tungsten ore, etc., were transshipped through Vietnam before the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the Burma Road were blockaded. Moreover, the diplomatic obstacles encountered by the Japanese are not only the opposition of China, France, and the Soviet Union, but also the disapproval of Germany. According to unofficial reports, the view held by senior German officials is that Germany's war strategy is not for Japan or any other non-Axis countries, but only for the benefit of the German-Italian Axis. Although this news has not been confirmed, it has excited people, who believe that it at least means that Germany is helping France refuse some of Japan's demands.

Tokyo. Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma told reporters today that we have received a telegram from Japanese officials in Vietnam and that we believe that the negotiations between the Japanese and French authorities have made some progress. Reporters urged him to state definitively whether the negotiations had made good progress without interruption, or whether the negotiations were proceeding smoothly. The spokesman replied that we understand that Japanese officials in the area are currently working hard to make progress in the negotiations. He could not use any adjectives to describe the situation of the negotiations. Reporters also asked whether it was true that Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux had sent three telegrams to President Roosevelt, asking the United States to assist in the French-Japanese negotiations. The spokesman replied that he had not received any official confirmation of this. (Dispatch of the 13th, Reuters)

Hanoi. According to eyewitnesses in Lao Cai, the bridge on the Chinese side of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway on the Vietnamese border, which was previously destroyed by Chinese forces, will take months for the Japanese army to repair. Train passengers must transfer to boats when crossing the bridge. The French authorities here appear to be engaged in very careful preparations, and a full mobilization has been implemented. Merchants in uniform hold morning exercises every morning, and armed soldiers guard the main government offices. Furthermore, veterans of the previous French war held a meeting this afternoon to discuss current events. (Dispatch of the 13th, United Press)

### Four Waves of Japanese Aircraft Attack Chongqing; German Embassy Bombed; Methodist Church School Also Destroyed; Jialing Apartments Uninhabitable

Chongqing. Four waves of Japanese aircraft have again carried out bombing raids over Chongqing. The German embassy was directly hit and destroyed. In the same area, the dormitories of the Methodist Church Middle School were also destroyed this afternoon. The Jialing Apartments, which are run by the government and intended for foreign residents, are no longer habitable due to the extensive damage sustained over the past two days. There were no deaths or injuries when the German embassy was destroyed, as the embassy staff reside and work in a location on the south bank of the Yangtze River. However, German embassy officials said that although the embassy has a temporary office on the south bank of the Yangtze River, the destroyed building was the official facility. The bombs fell directly on the embassy roof, where the swastika flag was erected. After the bombing, the swastika flag was still standing upright, but the embassy building had been reduced to ashes. A major fire broke out in the bombed area today and took an hour to extinguish. The area on the south bank of the Yangtze River is mostly foreign-owned property, and most of the residents are foreigners. It was also bombed today. The air raid alarm lasted for four hours and was lifted at 2:00 PM. (Dispatch of the 13th, United Press)

Chongqing. Yesterday at noon and at 7:10 PM, one hundred Japanese aircraft flew into the wartime capital again in two successive waves, dropping countless bombs on the lower city and residential areas, but there were no casualties. In this raid on Chongqing, the Japanese aircraft imitated the Germans and began using low-flying bombers during the noon raid. New architectural areas on the south bank of the Yangtze River and on the outskirts of the capital were bombed at noon. The editorial office of the Shih-shih Hsin-pao was also destroyed. The second wave consisted of five teams of Japanese aircraft, apparently from the Yichang airfield, which invaded the area in the bright moonlight. However, they encountered intense anti-aircraft fire. During this time, cities near Chongqing were also bombed. It is reported that in the first air raid, the Chinese shot down one Japanese low-flying aircraft. (Dispatch of the 13th, United Press)

Chongqing. Thirty-six Japanese aircraft bombed the western suburbs of Chongqing this afternoon, causing a major fire in one location. The air raids of the past two days suggest that these bombings are not targeting any specific objectives but are merely for harassment. It is reported that a total of forty-six Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing yesterday, dropping bombs on the south bank of the Yangtze River and the western suburbs. Six of the Japanese aircraft were light dive bombers that carried out a dive-bombing attack for the first time. Several bombs fell near the British Ambassador's residence. The Shih-shih Hsin-pao building has been destroyed, and the Jialing Mansion has also been affected. Yesterday afternoon, three Japanese aircraft raided Chongqing, dropping many bombs in the lower city area. (Dispatch of the 13th, Reuters)

### Japanese Envoy Meets with Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies; Matsuoka Delivers Speech

Tokyo. Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma stated today that we hope that Envoy Kobayashi, who is traveling to the Dutch East Indies, can begin negotiations with the Dutch authorities there as soon as possible. Kobayashi arrived in Batavia at 8:00 AM yesterday and paid a visit to Governor-General Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer at 6:00 PM, along with Japanese Consul General Saito, for a one-hour meeting.

The spokesman also requested that the Dutch East Indies government appoint representatives for future meetings, including Economic Affairs Minister Moke, Justice Minister Ansovinn, and Commercial Affairs Bureau Chief Hoogstraaten of the Department of Economic Affairs. (Dispatch of the 13th, Reuters)

Singapore. The Singapore Japanese Daily, which is run by the Japanese, recently published a commentary on the visit of the Japanese delegation to the Dutch East Indies, arguing that Japan should seek a supply of oil from the Dutch East Indies, and that oil from the oil wells in the Dutch East Indies is one of Japan's main necessities. At a time when war has broken out in Europe and the United States is reserving more of its war materials for the European war, Japan should seek its main supplies from various sources. Malaya has already supplied Japan with rubber and tin, but Japan also relies heavily on the Dutch East Indies for its greater needs. (Dispatch of the 13th, Taiwanese Press)

Tokyo. Foreign Minister Matsuoka recently stated in a speech at the Japan Trade Association that Japan's "Greater East Asia" construction program is currently focused on obtaining raw materials and planning the sources of supply. Commerce and Industry Minister Kobayashi's trip to the Dutch East Indies is related to the objectives of Japan's current policy. "In order to build Greater East Asia and the common prosperity within the scope of this Greater East Asia, it is necessary to cooperate with countries that have the same requirements and at the same time eliminate all the obstacles that have been discovered or have not yet been discovered." Matsuoka believes that the European war has greatly reduced Japan's export trade and that the days when Japanese goods were sold in the world market due to their good quality and low price have passed. "Due to the recent war tensions and the deterioration of our relations with the United States, the problem of obtaining mainly goods has become increasingly difficult." Matsuoka also said that creating prosperity in Asia and bringing peace to the world is the mission of the Japanese nation and all East Asian nations. (Dispatch of the 13th, United Press)

Moscow. Recent reports from the German Secret Service and radio broadcasts have appeared in various foreign newspapers, stating that the German government will convene a conference of experts in Vienna to discuss the international problems of the Danube River in order to change the current international status of the river. Regarding this matter, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky met with German Ambassador Schulenburg on the 10th and stated to Schulenburg that since the Soviet Union is a country bordering the Danube River, it cannot ignore the river's navigation system.

### British Efforts to Promote Anglo-Soviet Relations

London: According to reliable sources, Britain has proposed to Moscow a resolution of the dispute between them arising from the Soviet annexation of the Baltic states. It is claimed that Britain has suggested that Moscow's claim to the Baltic banks' gold reserves of £4 million held in London be offset against Britain's claim to investments of £5.5 million in the Baltic states. It is also reported that Britain has suggested that the respective claims could be dealt with flexibly, pending further discussion after the war ends. Reliable sources also say that Britain has expressed its willingness to charter thirty or forty Latvian or Estonian ships for use in British territorial waters. However, political circles believe that Moscow will reject this proposal, since Britain's attitude is rather arrogant, and acceptance of the proposal would mean that the gold reserves and ships of the Baltic states claimed by the Soviet Union would fall into British hands, and the Soviet Union has no strong interest in such a "dishonorable proposal."

### General von Brauchitsch Inspects Troops in France; Large-Scale Attack on England Expected Soon; Small Fleet Assembled Off French Coast Awaiting Orders; Autumn Tides Favorable for German Operations

London: London expects Germany to attack England today. Well-informed sources generally believe that since Hitler began his "inferior victory" political career, those who have studied him believe that this "Nazi Caesar" will never directly attack England, but will attack the southeastern coast of England at the narrowest point in the Dover Strait. It is rumored that a small fleet off the French coast is preparing to sail. Reliable sources believe that the greatest pain currently felt by Londoners is the distraction of British attention due to preparations for a German invasion. The British Air Force has inflicted severe blows on the enemy fleet, but it is generally believed that this is not enough to cope with a large-scale German offensive. British authorities believe that the German leader will launch an attack within the next ten days, but it is said that his major offensive will be delayed until next spring. (International News Service, 13th)

Stockholm: According to newspapers, the German invasion of Britain began at 9:00 PM on the 11th when German planes launched a fierce attack on Britain. Londoners already know that Germany is preparing ships to sail to the British coast under the cover of coastal batteries when the invasion begins. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)

Berlin: General von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, inspected the German troops stationed in France over the past two days and visited the ports along the Atlantic coast. These ports are the base for the German Navy's operations against England. Von Brauchitsch toured the ports by motorboat and encountered many submarines and minesweepers along the way. Sailors on warships in each port lined up on the deck to welcome the Commander-in-Chief. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)

Berlin: German sources claim that General von Brauchitsch is "currently inspecting troops in northern France." From this, it can be seen that the British claim that Germany will invade England soon is accurate as the German side concentrates its troop transport ships, seemingly preparing for a quick crossing of the short 20-mile channel to land in England. (International News Service, 13th)

New York: According to the local weather bureau yesterday, the tides along the southeast coasts of England are quite favorable for Germany. If Germany invades the British Isles in the next few days, the tides may provide some assistance. (United Press, 13th)

### London Suffers Two Air Raids in One Day; Buckingham Palace Bombed Again; King and Queen Safe in Air Raid Shelter; Downing Street Also Bombed, No Damage Caused

London: Buckingham Palace, which had been slightly damaged by a delayed-action bomb a few days ago, sustained further damage from several bombs dropped during today's longest daytime air raid on London. Fortunately, the King and Queen were both unharmed. It was observed that a German twin-engine bomber dived down from the clouds over the palace, and the pilot seemed to reduce speed. Immediately afterwards, the sound of bombs falling and exploding followed in succession. The King and Queen both took refuge in an air raid shelter inside the palace. One of the bombs completely destroyed the Royal Chapel, and two bombs landed in the lawn, creating huge craters. The main water pipe was broken, and many doors and windows were shattered. Three palace staff members sustained minor injuries because the air raid shelter they took refuge in was too close to the destroyed chapel. Troops and police from the Wellington Barracks and others rushed to the site of the bombing upon hearing the sound and extinguished the fires caused by incendiary bombs near the palace. Several incendiary bombs also fell on Downing Street, but caused no damage. The air raid began at 8:40 AM this morning and lasted for about four hours. Regent Street, Berkeley Square, Cannon Street, and Watling Street were also bombed. As far as is currently known, the offices of the "Daily Herald" and the "Evening Standard" were hit by bombs, and a cinema attached to Madame Tussaud's famous wax museum was also struck. According to the Air Ministry, in yesterday's air battles, Germany lost a total of 56 heavy bombers and 22 fighter-bombers, and at least 250 airmen were killed. (Reuters, 13th)

London: The War Cabinet today sent congratulations to the King and Queen for their escape from the air raid. The King replied to the Prime Minister by telegram, saying, "The Queen and I are grateful for the War Cabinet's congratulations. We have now, like so many other people, gained first-hand experience of the barbarity of the Germans. This behavior of the Germans can only strengthen our determination to fight to final victory."

### London's Air Raid Alarms Frequent Yesterday; New Defense Measures Prove Effective

London: London issued its second daytime air raid alarm at 8:40 AM this morning. Following the first alarm at 6:37 AM, anti-aircraft batteries in the southwest area opened fire on German planes. The German planes were using low clouds as cover. Although the alarm was sounding, a large number of citizens continued to work as usual. The bridges over the Thames River were crowded with pedestrians, and most buses continued to run. The first alarm was lifted at 7:32 AM. London's new defense method for repelling night-time enemy aircraft, which involves creating a formidable network of fire with anti-aircraft guns without the aid of searchlights, seemed less continuous last night than the night before, but the concentration of firepower was perhaps even greater whenever the sound of German planes was heard. According to a joint communiqué from the Air Ministry and the Home Security Department, although the enemy air raid last night was small in scale, many areas of the British enclave were affected. Single or small groups of enemy aircraft were fiercely intercepted by British defenses in many places. Although the enemy aircraft dropped many high-explosive and incendiary bombs in and around the City of London and caused several fires, the damage was far less than the previous night. Detailed reports of casualties are not yet available, but as far as is currently known, casualties in the London area were very light. Some houses were destroyed and there were minor casualties in two towns in Lancashire and a town in the east suburbs of London. The Midlands suffered an unprecedentedly long period of strafing, but the damage was very slight apart from property damage, and casualties were also few. A Catholic church west of London was hit by a bomb and burned down last night, leaving only the four walls standing. (Reuters, 13th)

London: The third air raid alarm of the day sounded in the London area at 2:55 PM this afternoon. A few minutes later, the sound of machine guns could be heard in the air. The alarm was lifted at 3:13 PM. (Reuters, 13th)

### Sixth Day of German Night Air Raids; British Release Casualty Report

London: German bombers soared over London at 9:10 PM yesterday. This was the sixth day of continuous German night raids on London. Ground batteries immediately opened fire fiercely, and a few searchlights were seen flashing. The alarm had not been lifted by 11:30 PM, but the gunfire was sparse. Details of the attack are not yet known. It is reported that during the recent attacks on London, bombs fell near several important buildings, such as the Bank of England, Mansion House, and St. Paul's Cathedral, and delayed-action bombs were discovered. The offices of the "Daily Herald" and "Evening Standard" newspapers were hit by bombs, and a cinema attached to Madame Tussaud's famous wax museum was also bombed. On the 12th, the first air raid alarm in London sounded at nearly 4:00 PM. The drone of aircraft engines could be heard in the distance, but there was no gunfire, indicating that the attacking enemy aircraft had been blocked far away, as there was no development in the London area. The alarm was lifted at 4:40 PM. The Air Ministry's Information Office stated that yesterday afternoon, 150 German bombers, escorted by fighters, launched an attack. Two squadrons of Hurricane fighters successfully intercepted them head-on, protecting London from the attack. Eighteen of the enemy aircraft flying towards London were confirmed to have been shot down, and many other enemy aircraft may not have been able to return to their original defenses. Some enemy aircraft were chased to the coast and escaped across the Channel. A few other small teams of weak enemy aircraft attempted to infiltrate London but were also shot down by British aircraft. The remaining aircraft dropped bombs in the woods and then fled back. (Reuters, 13th)

London: Last night's German attack lasted for eight and a half hours and was not completely lifted until 4:55 AM this morning. It is not known what damage was caused in the center of London during this attack. Yesterday, the total casualties from air raids in the London area were 165 dead and 420 injured. The afternoon bombing killed 125 and injured 250, while the night bombing killed 40 and injured 170. (Reuters, 13th)

### London Under Attack Like a City of the Dead; Thames River Banks Severely Damaged

London: London was like a city of the dead on Wednesday night, as thousands of refugees in the city took shelter in underground chambers and tunnels 75 feet below ground all night to avoid air raids. The shaking of windows, the burst of shrapnel during explosions, the sound of shattering glass, the sound of airplane engines, and the rumbling of guns and cannons were mixed together and did not stop all night. Although no searchlights were used that night, the bright light from the anti-aircraft fire made the houses along the streets as bright as pictures. People considered even short distances of a few feet on the street to be dangerous areas and dared not walk across them. Many famous hotels near the bridges over the Thames River were included, as an unexploded bomb had fallen there. (United Press, 13th)

Berlin: Photos taken by German reconnaissance planes of London yesterday clearly show that some areas in the suburbs and city of London are completely unrecognizable. There are still 33 fires burning, one of which has a diameter of at least 500 meters. The destructive power of German bombs has caused unbelievable devastation to the oil pools in Victoria Harbour, the factories, warehouses, and cold storage facilities on both banks of the Thames River. Without consulting a map, it is impossible to recognize the docks in Silvertown, downstream on the Thames River. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)

### Many Time Bombs Explode; Reuters Headquarters Unharmed

London: Several time bombs exploded in central London at dusk yesterday, destroying a four-story building and piercing its basement, but there were no deaths or injuries because all the people in the area had been evacuated.

Dublin: Foreign rumors that the Reuters news agency building was also hit by a bomb during a recent air raid on London. We have now received a telegram denying this rumor, and stating that the German aircraft's attacks last night were greatly hampered by unprecedentedly fierce anti-aircraft fire and low clouds, and only dropped a few bombs in the London area during the first few hours of the attack. (Reuters, 13th)

Berlin: According to German reconnaissance aircraft, the British Woolwich Arsenal has been on fire since it was bombed by German aircraft on the 11th, and the fire has not yet been extinguished as of yesterday. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)

### British Air Force Flies Across the Channel; Intensifies Offensive Against Germany; Continues Extensive Attacks to Deter Aggression; Berlin Airport and Train Stations Bombed

The British Air Force bombed the large-scale transport tools of the German side along the Channel coast while also bombing important targets in Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen, Wilhelmshaven, and other German cities, aiming to achieve a pincer effect. The destructive air battle between Britain and Germany was so fierce that it can be described as unprecedented. According to the British side, Berlin's famous Tempelhof Airport, Anhalter and Potsdamer stations, and anti-aircraft positions in the Tiergarten district were all destroyed on Thursday. (International News Service, 13th)

### Germany Claims British Air Force Spreads Pests

New York: Today, German official radio stations denounced the British for spreading pests to damage German potato fields. It is claimed that the British Air Force dropped countless pests on German potato fields. Bags of pestilence have also been found in western Germany, northern Luxembourg, and Belgium. Professor Darlington of Harvard University said that it is very easy for the British to spread such pests, but in Germany, such pests have been a problem for many years.

### Italy Divides Troops into Three Routes; Prepares to Attack Egypt; To Coordinate with German Military Operations; Italian Troops in Libya Busy Moving

London: Responsible sources in London say that Italian troop movements have recently been detected near Gaps in northern Libya, but the Italian troops have not yet invaded the Egyptian border. It is rumored that the Italian side is currently forming three armies to attack Egypt in separate routes: one route will proceed along the coast past Solum; the second route will head northwest from Kassala to Faddia; the third route will advance along the Sudanese-Egyptian border from its base near Tachida. However, this route of Italian troops must travel directly through 400 miles of waterless desert before it can reach Faddia and coordinate with the second army departing from Kassala. According to experienced military experts here, a sudden Italian attack is possible, but the claim that a large number of troops are advancing from this direction cannot be easily believed. As far as is currently known, there are no German troops assisting the Italian troops in Libya. (Reuters, 13th)

New York: Italy's advance from Egypt towards the Suez Canal and the intensified air raids between Germany and Britain show yesterday that the European war has gradually reached a new climax. Unconfirmed reports from Rome claim that Italy's three-pronged invasion of British positions in Egypt has already begun, and hinted that this attack will be launched at the same time as the climax of the war with Britain and the German army's landing in England. Two main forces of the Italian army are reportedly advancing from Libya along the Mediterranean coast towards Egypt, with the ultimate goal of cutting off Britain's "lifeline." The mutual air raids between the Italian and British fleets in North Africa on Wednesday were the prelude to this offensive. At the same time, Germany is showing increasing signs of preparing to invade England. (United Press, 13th)

Cairo: British sentries in Kenya have made contact with Italian troops on the 200-mile-long northern border in that area and inflicted damage on the Italian troops. (United Press, 13th)

### US Embargo on Scrap Iron Exports Planned; Roosevelt Considering; US-Japan Relations Worsen

Washington: Scrap iron experts today recommended to the National Defense Committee that scrap iron exports be banned. The committee will forward the report to the White House. Yesterday, several representatives from the Scrap Iron Research Association held consultations with Maxwell, Director of Export Administration, but no decision was reached. A spokesman announced to the public that the research association had discussed the matter of scrap iron exports with the National Defense Committee and that it was rumored that a stronger ban on exports had been drafted. As for news from the National Defense Committee, the report has indeed been submitted to the White House, but officials have not yet indicated whether President Roosevelt will strengthen the ban on exports in the near future. (United Press, 13th)

Washington: It is widely rumored here that the United States will soon expand its export ban to prohibit military supplies from being shipped to Japan. However, these rumors have not yet been confirmed. (Reuters, 13th)

Washington: California Democratic Representative Henry Ellenbogen claimed yesterday that relations between the United States and Japan "may be on the verge of rupture." If the situation becomes serious, "we should isolate ourselves to cope with it." Ellenbogen also inserted an article written by Japanese journalist Kawakami into the Congressional Record. According to the article, Japan deeply understands that trying to maintain friendly relations with the United States has been ineffective, so it has no choice but to change its policy or lean towards joining hands with Britain, as it is easier to cooperate with them in the Far East. The article was published in "Foreign Affairs Magazine." Ellenbogen believes that the article must have been approved by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs before it was published. Furthermore, the objectives of Britain and the United States in the Far East seem to lack coordination, and under certain policies, the two countries are clearly in a position of conflict. Ellenbogen commented, "Judging from various facts, as well as the international situation and the activities of our government, a rift between us and Japan is inevitable. However, once we are indeed in a rupture, it is necessary for us to isolate ourselves to cope with it. It is impossible to see the outcome of the final situation in the shortest period of time. Even after a long period of stalemate, neither side will see any benefit. In short, this issue depends on how both sides decide to act." (United Press, 13th)

New York: The "New York Post" recently published an article advocating a complete ban on scrap iron exports to Japan and fortifying Wake Island and Midway Island. The newspaper said that the United States is facing dangers in both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, and that the United States' two-ocean navy may not be fully completed before 1946.

### US Powder Factory Explosion in New Jersey; Over Three Hundred Dead and Injured

Dover, New Jersey: The Hercules powder factory near Kenvil, New Jersey, experienced a mysterious explosion yesterday. The blast resounded like thunder, and the factory was destroyed. At least fifty people are dead and three hundred are injured. Everyone suspects that this may have been the work of saboteurs. A very large powder magazine narrowly escaped being affected. If it had also exploded, the entire village would have been destroyed. This disaster is a new record in the history of American powder explosions. President Roosevelt has specifically ordered the Red Cross and the Army Department to quickly prepare relief efforts. Almost all of the buildings on the 1,800-acre factory site have been destroyed, and all residents of the area have been ordered to evacuate. It was also heard just now that another powder magazine spewed out huge flames late last night. The magazine stored 250,000 pounds of gunpowder, which was manufactured under secret orders for use by the United States and Britain. (International Telegram, 13th)

Washington: The Director of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, J. Edgar Hoover, today took responsibility on behalf of the government for thoroughly investigating the explosion at the Hercules powder factory in Kenvil, New Jersey.

### Romanian Army Provocative Actions Against the Soviet Union Again; The Soviet Union Lodges Another Protest

Moscow: The Deputy Commissar of the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs met with the Romanian Minister to Moscow, Gafencu, yesterday and made the following statement: "At 1:00 PM on September 11, in the Balos Hill area (34 kilometers southeast of Zhichinowetz), Romanian troops suddenly opened machine gun and rifle fire on Soviet sentries. When another team of Soviet border guards moved towards the firing point, they were also shot at. The Soviet border guards were forced to retaliate. The Soviet government protested the provocative behavior of the Romanian army on August 29, but has not yet received a response. At the same time, the Romanian army resumed its provocative behavior on the 11th. The Soviet government hereby requests the Romanian government to pay attention to this kind of behavior again, which is by no means tolerable by the Soviet side." The Romanian Minister replied immediately that he would forward the Romanian government's reply to the Soviet government's protest on August 29 to the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs on the 13th.

### Italy Sends Note: Pétain Government Asked to Demobilize North African French Forces, Rejected by France

New York - According to reliable sources, the Pétain government received a note from Italy demanding the full demobilization of the North African French forces. They also received a note from Germany demanding the surrender of 58% of the livestock in the unoccupied French territory. It is reported that the French government rejected both demands. Italy's request is based on the reasoning that the 200,000 North African French troops might join General de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French in London, greatly increasing the strength of British forces in the Mediterranean. Italy now sees the Mediterranean as a major threat to its invasion of Egypt. Well-informed circles in Washington believe that France's current rejection of the Axis powers' demands may result in the Pétain government being overthrown, or the German and Italian troops occupying all of France or a larger portion than they do now.

### European War Talks (5): The Day Paris Fell

Paris, renowned worldwide for its prosperity, a city of indulgence and pleasure, often called the "City of Light," became a ghost town when it fell on June 14th of this year. This article is a record by Otto D. Tolischus, the Berlin bureau chief of the United Press, who personally witnessed the German army's entry into Paris in the evening. The original article was published in the July 8th issue of the American illustrated weekly "Life." It is translated as follows:

Since the German army launched its general offensive in the west on May 10th, I have passed through many cities in Belgium and northern France that have become ruins and deserted. However, the impression I received on June 14th, when I followed the vanguard of the German army into Paris, the capital of France, was the most unforgettable. Although I was there, I could hardly believe that such a prosperous and bustling metropolis had turned into a ghost town. Yet, the city was indeed deathly silent. It also seemed unbelievable that Paris had fallen into the hands of the German army, but it was indeed the German army that occupied the French capital.

Apart from the Paris city police still standing guard at street corners, not a single person could be found in this metropolis of four million residents. The residents had long since fled under the irresistible offensive of the German army. Seventy percent had fled to nearby towns, and thirty percent remained indoors.

Anyone who has been to Paris can imagine what it was like: the Place de la Concorde, which was always bustling with traffic, honking cars, shouting newspaper vendors, police directing traffic, and people chatting - all of this was now gone. Only occasionally would a car carrying German officers, honking its horn, break the silence and head towards the German headquarters hastily set up in the most luxurious Hotel Crillon. The swastika flag flew on the roof of the hotel. In 1919, American President Wilson was cheered by the French people on the balcony of this hotel, and the star-spangled American flag also flew on the roof.

The desolate scene at the Place de la Concorde was the same everywhere else. The boulevards were lined with cafes, where people used to sit and sip aperitifs, full of life; now, they were deserted, with a ghostly feeling. We saw one cafe still open on the Champs-Élysées. None of the luxurious hotels in the famous hotel district of Paris were not tightly shuttered. We saw the swastika flag replacing the red, white, and blue tricolor flag on the Eiffel Tower, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the City Hall, waving in the wind. The most striking of these was the German flag on the Arc de Triomphe.

Finally, around ten o'clock in the evening, we saw a German officer coming through the Opera Avenue, and we asked him if there was a hotel where we could spend the night. He replied, "The Hotel Scribe has been requisitioned by our army. You might try your luck there." A group of us, because we had been living in the trenches, our clothes unironed and wrinkled, tired and weary, covered in dust, dragged our feet towards the Hotel Scribe. The polite manager of the hotel was taken aback when he saw this unkempt group of people. He hurriedly said, "I'm very sorry, but the headquarters has requisitioned all 160 rooms here for senior German officers."

There were nine foreign journalists in our group (three of whom were American), along with representatives from the Ministry of the Army, the Propaganda Department, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a total of thirty people. The leader, a major, after hearing the manager's words, said firmly, "I order you to find rooms for our group."

We were starving, but the hotel manager insisted that there was nothing to eat. However, he said, "He knew that some German officers had eaten breakfast and dinner at the Hotel Ritz, so you might want to try your luck there." Our group of journalists who couldn't be seen by anyone marched to the Hotel Ritz. The manager of the Hotel Ritz was already a little unsteady on his feet, and almost fainted when he saw this large group of people. He muttered that the kitchen was already "closed" and that the cooks and waiters had gone home. Our valiant major was not deceived. He gave an order to the drivers: "Drivers, attention." They immediately lined up, their heels clicking together.

"Who among you knows how to cook?" A round-faced, chubby man among the drivers immediately replied, "Sir, I can cook, at your command." Our leader said to them, "You all go to the kitchen to help."

Five minutes later, two drivers wearing long boots, their footsteps loud, led us towards the basement. Holding their breath, they carried a box of champagne. Of course, there were no wine glasses or dishes, so they took the whole bottle of champagne out of the box and handed it to us. No one found it strange.

Suddenly, four waiters appeared in evening dress, impeccably clean. We don't know how the hotel manager found them. Perhaps he thought that in such a luxurious hotel, it would be a bit impolite to the hotel for the rough soldiers to clumsily serve food like on the battlefield. Strangely enough, delicious ham, soft cheese, and perfectly cooked fried eggs were served one after another. This was the delicacy we tasted on our first night in Paris.

On the first night I entered Paris with the German army, I had an unforgettable impression. It was dusk, and we were slowly touring the city center. The first thing that caught my eye was the historical Arc de Triomphe, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of the European War, and the "Eternal Flame." Many refugees were gathered here. The scene was too tragic to bear. Widows and young women were distraught, children were tugging at their clothes, crying. Old men with white hair were also shedding tears down their cheeks.

The accompanying officer whispered in my ear: "We have no complaints about the French soldiers who fought bravely. We are only dissatisfied with those politicians who have misled the country." Several others told me that they truly understood how tragic the French soldiers would feel when they imagined standing in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on Unter den Linden Avenue in Berlin. German officers and soldiers saluted the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier as they passed through the Arc de Triomphe. The day after entering Paris, they also prepared a large wreath made of red, white, and blue flowers, decorated with black ribbons, and placed it in front of the tomb.

At this tomb, I also gained another profound impression. What was a sorrow for France was a joy for Germany. It was Sunday, June 16th. The Iron Army led by General von Brauchitsch marched through the Champs-Élysées, through the Arc de Triomphe, to the Avenue Foch. To the French, this was clearly a humiliation; to the Germans, this was the common wish of every citizen since the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. Hitler also had a deep meaning in choosing this army to enter Paris. General von Brauchitsch's troops had achieved glorious victories in the Battle of Kutno in Poland. General von Brauchitsch personally told me, "They have fought in more than fifty battles. Every one of them is made of iron and steel. Their eyes are as bright when they go to the battlefield as they are when they march here." (End of this article)

### Rumors Disappear, Gold Market Flat

Yesterday's cash spot black market fluctuated around 6,150 yuan. The repercussions of the rumors have subsided, but the competition between bulls and bears is still fierce. When the price fell, Qian Dui Ye and others continued to add to their positions. Generally speaking from the psychology of retail investors, the weak trend may reappear. Because the foreign exchange rate is weak and flat, there is no encouragement for buyers. It is fortunate that the closing result today rose by 15 yuan, and the operators were all overjoyed. It once dropped to 6,130 yuan in the early morning, and the highest reached 6,185 yuan. The noon closing was stable. The subsequent market trend was similar to the morning.

The silver shop traded 20 taels, retreating to 6,130 yuan. Qian Dui Ye's appetite gradually increased, and a certain silver shop suddenly came to search, and the gold shop turned from selling to buying, and the price rose to 6,185 yuan for the second time. However, the buying trend gradually dissipated after that. Securities firms and retail investors sold one after another, and the price fell back to 6,150 yuan before closing. Fortunately, Qian Dui Ye was still willing to maintain the price at closing, and the closing price was 6,164 yuan. The market opened 11 yuan higher in the afternoon. The gold shop traded 20 taels at 6,175 yuan. Later, because there were slightly more sellers, it immediately dropped by 10 yuan. However, Qian Dui Ye's bull position added to the absorption, and it once rose to 6,185 yuan. However, gold shops, securities firms, etc. sold at high prices, and retail investors followed suit for a while, and the trend turned soft. It was once as low as 6,145 yuan. After entering, buyers took the opportunity to buy again at low prices. At the same time, the number of sellers suddenly decreased, and the result was a closing price of 6,170 yuan, which was 15 yuan higher than the previous day's rise. The whole day fluctuated by 55 yuan. The selling price of cash gold shops was more than 10 yuan higher than the spot market price. The purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan, and the current spot gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. Both were rarely traded.

Jewelry Gold Exchange Price Unchanged

The exchange price of silver jewelry per tael did not change throughout the day. Da Tonghang still hung 630 yuan. The price of Xin Tonghang was similar to the above price. The purchase price was reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Food: Foreign Rice Still Expensive, New Rice Arrivals Quite Strong

The foreign rice market is still living its black market life in the dark market, and it is being used as a bargaining chip by speculative groups. The market has long deviated from the right track, and it is swayed by people's hearts and rumors. In the early morning, the source of domestic rice arrivals increased, and there were also thousands of bags of Anhui new indica rice arriving via the Yangtze River. However, actual sales were reduced due to "yielding to the festival," and there were no changes in the domestic and foreign situation sufficient to manipulate the market as an excuse. The market price suddenly plummeted by more than one yuan as many profiteers took profits. However, after the price stabilized, it was favored by new hoarding. Large households and firms held on as before, and actual sales also slightly increased. The market gradually recovered by 70 to 80 cents to nearly one yuan. Formal transactions in the market are still only for red tip, polished tip, foreign yuan rice, and other goods that are not restricted. Other rice, such as Saigon and Siam rice, are all traded in the dark market like Du Geng. The total daily transaction volume is still 5,000 to 6,000 bags. It is reported that No. 1 aged Saigon rice is still 69 yuan, fired twist is 68 yuan, No. 2 Saigon is 65 yuan, No. 2 Siam and small twist are 63.5 yuan, 63 yuan, Tokyo stone tip is 60 yuan, 59 yuan, rice tea is high at 56 yuan, and secondary is 54 yuan.

Geng (rice) and domestic rice, 600 to 700 bags arrived yesterday. Both open and dark transactions, because it was initially rumored that foreign rice was weakening, and they turned lax. The sellers persisted, and they also stood firm, without much change. All were equivalent to the previous disk.

The source of new Geng tips is quite strong, but most of the Geng goods are accounted for, and the tips are only limited. It is estimated that more than 50 piculs of new Geng from Zhoupu, 28 dan of new Yang tips from Taicang and Jiading, and 6 dan of newly arrived Jiao Li new Du tips have been delivered, resulting in a dull sales field. Because the body is soft and difficult to maintain, its new Geng is difficult to stand, and the market is exclusively depreciated by 1.5 yuan. Opening at 73 yuan and 72.5 yuan, the new Yang tips are balanced between arrival and sales, and the original packaged goods from Taicang and Jiading are still 66.5 yuan, 66 yuan, and 64.5 yuan per peck. The Jiao Li new Du tips, first because they are fresh when they arrive, and second because there are only 6 dan, so the opening price is more elegant than the Yang tips, reaching 67.5 yuan, 67 yuan.

### Hoarding Wind Not Checked, Japanese Flour Re-emerges

Flour, yesterday's spot flour market, was quite persistent. The Chinese flour factory's disk was still 15.5 yuan. The number of batches released by the two factories was not large. At present, the stock of inland flour is deficient. The demand for factory flour on this street is not weak, and there is often a shortage of supply. Because of the news that a certain party is not allowed to be transported into the concession, the Phoenix brand spot flour is looking forward to a good, holding a lack of opening. However, the Phoenix brand futures flour, which is emphasized by the speculative community, is even more elated, and the hoarding has not declined. The opening in October is still flat, and the price is only 15.65 yuan. Then, because the rice price is firm and stable, the hoarder absorbs it, and it gradually rises to 15.8 yuan, which is 0.13 yuan higher than the previous day. September rose from 15.35 yuan to 2.8 yuan, which is also 0.08 yuan higher than the previous day. The total number of transactions in September was only 4,000 bags, and the total number of transactions in October was 20,000 bags. The spot factory flour transaction volume in this street for retail transactions is more than 6,000 bags, and the foreign flour and inland flour transactions are all quiet. However, it is reported that the Northern Ocean Gang has added thousands of bags of leftover flour, and the price is 15.8 yuan. Also, there are 1,500 bags of flour going to Weihaiwei today.

Wheat, yesterday's market situation was still dull. Inland goods were suspended due to the transportation stop, and transportation was blocked. The Chinese factory did not have a good appetite because it was scheduled for foreign wheat to arrive. Japanese factories specialize in choosing cleverness. It is heard that the goods sent to the factory are 2,000 to 3,000 bags every day, all of which are received by the Sanxin factory, and the price is still around 21 yuan. Chinese factories need to add more than 3 yuan to the purchase price, and only receive 200 to 300 bags of goods.

### Securities: News Confusing, Bond Market Rises and Falls Sharply

Yesterday's securities dark market trend was like rabbits rising and hawks falling, with sudden rises caused by rumors of the successful new loan, and sudden falls because the news was not believed by a part of the people, resulting in bulls still coming out. The so-called events have reasons, and the investigation has no basis. However, regarding this news, the opinion of the financial community is that the events do have reasons, but the factual basis does not seem to be mature, and is probably still brewing. Therefore, public bonds are not greatly stimulated, and most of the market is still optimistic. The sudden rise and fall is still a part of the floating profit settlement, so the market price is not seen to be small. Because of the special relationship with customers, Dingzhong must sell, so it can only suppress the price to sell. This has nothing to do with the overall trend of public bonds. Once the loan is confirmed, the rise will be even greater than before. This level should not be ignored. Yesterday's experience, the morning rise was very strong, and C-type once reached 6.3 yuan, which was 1 yuan higher than the next day. This is related to the general trust in the loan. Later, because the gold market was quiet as usual, there was no counter-evidence of a sharp drop, which caused many parties to doubt, and the floating profit fell back with the market. The market trend was in rotation in the afternoon, and people's minds were different. There were still many spills in the afternoon, and the market price of Dingzhong was only 3 yuan, with 50,000 transactions, and it was immediately sold off, which shows that the market appetite and digestion ability are still very strong. Although the future looks like a rotation, the number of people who are still bullish is still in the majority. As a result of the market price, except for the C and E types that did not have a high or low, the A and B types still rose by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, and the Ding type fell sharply by 0.7 yuan, which should be an exception. The total number of transactions was about 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock trading, 50 shares of Zhongxing Coal Mine Company were traded at a price of 113 yuan.

Also, the Public Industry Association reported that the stock market trend is very unstable, and the selling wind is expanding at any time. Fortunately, most of them were absorbed by the people who made up the short position. When the price was too low, there were still investors who took the opportunity to collect cheap. Although the weekend holiday is very long, the transaction volume is extremely large, indicating that the market's confidence is not lacking. If the news does not deteriorate, this belief will be more fully expressed. Rubber stocks fell sharply, while industrial stocks changed little.

### Yarn and Cotton: Futures Yarn Has Selling Short

The yarn market is still in a revolving environment. This is because the sales are not smooth and the foreign exchange is also calm. Therefore, although the bulls are looking at the rise, the environment does not allow it. According to this, the market should have a downward trend. However, households with general economic sufficiency are tightening and still do not give up. For a while, the chips are closed and not loosened. However, some futures are inclined to sell short, because the inventory is increasing day by day, and the sales channels are becoming narrower, so there are quite a few people who sell at high prices. The spot yarn is opened in the morning, and the popularity is still good, because the news is slightly better, and 20 count, Horse price is 973 yuan, and it immediately fell to 965 yuan. Later, the general scalpers re-activated and dragged them in one after another. The market was filled with buying, but in fact, there were not many actual buyers, and most of them were making a comeback. It rose to 979 yuan, but it was tight and expensive after the closing. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 2,943 packages were traded. The 20 count Double Horse market fell by 4 yuan. Today, 260 pieces of cotton yarn are shipped to Siam. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left,

### New Cotton from Jiangsu and Zhejiang is Good, But How Can It Be Shipped Out?

The situation of spot cotton is very stagnant. The new cotton from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is in good condition, but the procedures for obtaining and transporting the certificate are very difficult, and it cannot be shipped out. Cotton merchants have to sit idly by. The foreign cotton purchased in the past is still sufficient, but the factory is reluctant to purchase raw materials because of the future of the yarn market, which is not very hopeful. Therefore, it has also created an awkward situation.

According to another report, the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market is calm. Later, due to the good demand for spot goods, and the partial short covering, the closing price was higher than the previous day by 1 or 2 pound notes. The Indian market situation is flat, and the forecast is up by half a rupee.

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very quiet in recent days. All parties are holding a wait-and-see attitude because the political news is unpredictable. However, the market inventory is not abundant, and the cotton price will not fall again, because the same industry buys new cotton, and the foreign firms need to pay first and then load, and the risk is huge, so there are very few orders, so the existing inventory is planned to wait for a good price to sell in the future.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Slightly Decreases

Yesterday, the sugar market turned soft. The association divided the plate, and the local storage goods for two or four rough white sugars were 78 yuan, the new foreign storage goods were 78.6 yuan, small 0.2 yuan, and June arrival was 78 yuan. The old goods in April were slightly oily, 76 yuan, and the transit goods were 62.8 yuan. Dutch cotton white KD 74 yuan, 唛 63 yuan, 唛 were all 62 yuan. Taitoo B唛 16.8 yuan, and later 76.5 yuan, 0.4 yuan less than the previous day DY 73.5 yuan, unchanged, HX 73.5 yuan, the road goods are 73.25 yuan,

### Seafood: A New Batch of Siamese Light Sea Cucumber Arrives

Siamese light sea cucumber, due to the scarcity of arrivals, the market has gradually felt a lack. It has been a long time since the large size of goods was out of stock. Only a new batch arrived the day before yesterday, and it has already been sold, and the price is 205 yuan. Medium light is still 190 yuan, and the trend is very strong.

### North and South Goods New Peach Meat Bumper Harvest, Prices Plummet by Forty Yuan

Recently, new peach meat has been arriving continuously. This year's harvest is relatively abundant, so the opening price has gradually decreased. It is noted that the previous price had dropped to 235 yuan, but yesterday it plummeted by more than 20 yuan, settling at 180 yuan per lot. The total price decrease has reached 40 yuan.

### Coal White Coal Dust Sells Well

Although new shipments of Hongji white coal dust have been arriving continuously recently, shops and coal briquette factories in this street are actively procuring, searching everywhere. The market has a trend of selling goods as soon as they arrive. The market price for Hongji No. 1 dust has already been quoted at 118 yuan in unofficial transactions, and there is still demand. Transferring goods at the dock is 3 yuan cheaper per lot, with water transportation and rickshaw expenses to be borne by the customer.

### Medicinal Materials Fennel Production Price Exceeds Shanghai Market by 30-40 Yuan

Recently, due to the increased cost of Hong Kong exchange affecting fennel, according to a recent letter, the quoted price must exceed the Shanghai market by 30-40 yuan. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to agree on a price, resulting in a lack of arrivals. The quoted price is around 120 yuan, but no transactions have been made yet.

### Grains Broad Beans Rise Sharply Influenced by High Rice and Grain Prices, Leading to Speculators' Appetite

Yesterday, the soybean market was weak due to slightly fewer sources, and demand was not strong. However, broad beans suddenly rose sharply. This rising trend is entirely influenced by the soaring rice and grain prices, stimulating speculators' appetite, resulting in a prosperous situation for goods with low arrivals and inventory. Yesterday, Wu Jiang picked broad beans opened at 24 yuan, with one cart traded, and two carts of common goods were priced at 21.8 to 22 yuan. Over 140 bags of Qing broad beans from Maojia City in Beigang were priced at 11 yuan. Over 100 bags of Qing broad beans from Minhang in Nangang were priced at 19.75 yuan. 300-400 bags of Jiading white broad beans were priced at 21.4 yuan. Over 300 bags of Chongming sand broad beans were priced at 18.5 to 19 yuan. 500 bags of small-grain white broad beans from Wuhu were priced at 17.7 to 18 yuan.

Today, there are four cans of raw oil being shipped to Little Luzon, and another 500 bags of corn being shipped to Weihaiwei.

### Hardware Tinplate Continues to Rise

Due to the egg factories' ineffective procurement, some merchants from the north have been searching for tinplate recently. Some factories in this street have also been buying in small quantities. The inventory of this product in this port is not abundant, and the overseas supply is insufficient (because foreign pricing is higher than Shanghai market prices). Therefore, holders of the goods are thinking of increasing the standard trading price. It is noted that the market quotation yesterday was 210 yuan per box (containing 112 sheets) for 108-pound Italian goods, 240 yuan for American goods, 240 yuan for 200-pound Italian goods, and 280 yuan for 200-pound standard American goods.

### Maintaining Judicial Dignity, Making a Pure Statement, Lawful Officials Enforce Fixed Laws, Impartial Judgment Without Political Bias, Judge of the First Special Court Speaks with Western Reporter Yesterday

Regarding the incident of officials and translators of the First Special District Court receiving threatening letters, a responsible official of the First Special Court clarified the position to a reporter from the English-language "Da Mei Evening News" yesterday morning (September 13th), stating that they were appointed as officials of the Special Court by the legal Chinese government recognized by the signatory countries of the 1927 Court Agreement, responsible for enforcing the fixed laws of Chinese criminal law and not other laws.

Handling Cases, Striving for Fairness

Regarding all suspects and criminals, we will try our best not to show bias. We will never change the laws formulated by the Chinese government, nor do we intend to do so. Regarding the threatening letters, there is nothing to say, because we ourselves are enforcers of the laws formulated by the legal government.

Newly Promulgated Laws are Generally Invalid

The government of any country is subject to change. If there is a change in the Chinese government, there is no difference in its legal execution history of criminal law. However, it is completely different if the new government has not been recognized as the legal organ representing the people. The new laws it promulgates are generally invalid, and the legally appointed executive will never implement these new laws.

Continuing to Follow the National Government's Laws

We are appointed as court officials by the Chongqing National Government to maintain law and order in the Shanghai Special District. Our duty is to follow the laws formulated by the legal Chinese government recognized by all. This is what we are determined to continue to implement. We will not ask about laws set by other parties.

Threats and Intimidation are Not a Concern

If any appointed official disagrees with this view, it is due to their personal viewpoint. However, the legal government will never recognize it. Therefore, those with this point of view will be dismissed immediately. The responsibility of each judge is to implement the laws in the Chinese criminal law formulated by the legal government. We should ignore all the threats we have received in the past and present.

No Political Bias

Because we judge according to the law, we have no political bias, and it is our responsibility to judge criminals fairly and impartially. Each judge holds this belief, so they should continue to carry out the work we believe is fair. It is reported that every morning, when the judges go to the court, the Public Works Department Police Department dispatches special cars for pick-up and drop-off, and there are police officers with submachine guns and pistols accompanying the car for strict defense.

Japanese Judicial Officers Visit the Court

Yesterday afternoon, eight or nine Japanese people, riding in three cars, arrived one after another at the gate of the First Special District Local Court of Jiangsu Seven Seas at 870 Weihaiwei Road. At the same time, Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department's Legal Group, also rushed to the scene by car. He then got out of the car and led the group of Japanese into the court. The gate guards and detectives of the patrol room, seeing that the group of Japanese was led by lawyer Li, did not stop them. The group of Japanese, led by lawyer Li, visited the first, second, and third civil courts before leaving by car. The group of Japanese were Japanese prosecutors and other judicial personnel. With the prior consent of the Public Works Department, lawyer Li accompanied them on the visit. When the Japanese judicial personnel visited the Special Court, the Jing'an Temple Patrol Room heard the news and immediately sent senior police officers to the court to inquire about the truth before driving away.

### Miura Yoshiaki Scheduled to Leave Shanghai

After the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai was replaced by Kanegoro Horiuchi, Director of the East Asia Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the current Consul General, Yoshiaki Miura, was also announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 12th to be transferred to the position of Minister to Mexico. After receiving the order, Miura has scheduled to leave Shanghai for Japan by ship on the 26th of this month. After a short stay, he will go to Mexico to take office. He has been busy handling handover matters these days.

The Story of Fu and Horiuchi Changing to Ambassadors

Also, Horiuchi Kanegoro, who was recently sent to Shanghai as Consul, is a well-known China expert. He graduated from the Shanghai Tongwen College and returned to China to improve his university and study law. He originally served as the Director of the East Asia Section of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After Konoe Shigeru revisited his old tricks and made major changes to diplomatic personnel, he was sent to Shanghai as Consul General and Counselor of the Embassy. Recently, it was heard that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made a third change in personnel, specially appointing Horiuchi Kanegoro as Minister Plenipotentiary. From this, it can be seen that Japan's diplomatic policy is uncertain.

### Cosme Has No Preparation to Leave Shanghai Yet

There have been rumors that French Ambassador Cosme will soon leave Shanghai for Chongqing.

However, French Consul General Auchi is determined to leave Shanghai before the French Ambassador leaves.

### Schedule for Foreign Vessels to Sail for Defense

The requisition of Jardine Matheson's four ships, Yisheng, Yongsheng, Desheng, and Haosheng, when British troops withdrew from China has been completed in Singapore. They have successively returned to Hong Kong for resumption of sailing. The details have been reported. Now, the Yongsheng ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai today and is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Hong Kong for defense on the 19th. The Yisheng ship is expected to arrive on the 16th, and the sailing schedule has not yet been announced. The Taisheng ship will also return to Shanghai from Tianjin and Yantai on the 16th and is expected to sail from Shanghai for defense and to Hong Kong Bay on the 18th. It is heard that the Desheng ship will sail directly from Singapore to Saigon to transport rice to Shanghai before coming to Shanghai. The Haosheng ship is still on its way back to Shanghai, and news is scarce.

Rice Transport is Smooth

The Taikoo Steam Navigation Company's Ninghai ship completed loading at the Bund Wharf in the French Concession yesterday and is scheduled to set sail for Siam to transfer to Little Luzon this morning. The Jiaying ship is scheduled to sail on the 22nd. The company's Xinjiang ship is scheduled to sail to Saigon and other places on the 19th. The French Shipping Company's Xijiang ship will return to Shanghai in the middle of next month. The ships sailing to Saigon and Siam will carry large quantities of rice to Shanghai. Ships sailing to Haiphong also carry foreign rice to Shanghai. Therefore, there should be no problem with the source of foreign rice in this port.

### Unsuccessful in Suppressing Rice Prices, Evaluation Committee Accepts Blame, The Question of Whether the Committee Should Exist, Please Ask the Concession Authorities for Instructions, Two Members of the Evaluation Committee Have Sent Letters of Resignation

Previously, various rice industry groups in this city, following the instructions of the two Concession authorities and adapting to the factual needs, organized a Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee. Based on the production price of foreign rice, plus the reasonable profits of rice merchants, the committee would evaluate the highest price of foreign rice every Tuesday and Friday to prevent market manipulation and speculation. The committee has been established for more than two months. Recently, due to the tense situation in Vietnam, speculators are manipulating the market price. Although the committee held meetings on schedule as usual to discuss ways to suppress rice prices, it was difficult to achieve effective results, and the black market prevailed, making the price limit a mere formality. Yesterday, the committee held its eighth regular meeting. All the committee members and representatives from the two Concession municipal chambers of commerce attended the meeting. After a long discussion, it was still difficult to obtain concrete and effective measures to crack down on the black market and suppress rice prices. Under this bad environment, it was generally believed that it was necessary to send a letter to the Concession authorities asking for instructions.

Resolution Situation

The resolution stated, "This committee, considering the livelihoods of the common people, firmly maintains the evaluated price of the 3rd of this month. However, the black market has been prevailing in recent days, and the evaluation is tantamount to a mere formality. This committee has exhausted its efforts, and after repeated deliberations, there is no proper solution. Under these circumstances, whether this committee should continue to exist has actually become a problem. We have no choice but to report the difficulties and the production prices reported by various foreign firms in a letter to the two Concession authorities to ask for instructions so as to comply with them." It is also heard that the next meeting will not be held until the authorities have instructed them. Then, the responsibility of the authorities is even more significant, and there may be a day when the authorities will enforce rice prices and open the warehouses publicly. It is heard that at yesterday's meeting, Chairman Zhu Zixiang suggested two points to the conference: (1) Send a letter to the two Concession authorities to ask them to transfer the foreign rice of 100,000 bags that Yu Qiaqing has ordered to be transported to Shanghai for the purpose of cheap rice sales to Ningbo, and temporarily supply it to the market in order to stabilize people's hearts and increase spot goods in the market. (2) Send another letter to the Bean and Rice Grain Guild, urging member businesses to continue to subscribe for foreign rice at this time of food panic to ensure sufficient food for the people and to maintain a sufficient reserve.

Consultation on Collective Purchase

The Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee convened its sixth meeting of evaluation committee members on the 7th of this month. It was generally believed that in order to suppress rice prices, it was first necessary to increase the reserve of rice and grain and to crack down on the black market. As a result of the discussion, letters were sent to the two Concession authorities and the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, inviting representatives of various industries to advise and encourage the purchase of foreign rice on a specific date. The letters were delivered by a special messenger from the committee the next day. Now, a reply has been received from the authorities stating that they strongly agree with the collective ordering of foreign rice and have decided to invite representatives from various industries to consult on specific methods to promote its realization. They also stated that they will strictly enforce their powers to the best of their ability to crack down on the black market and assist in stabilizing the entire rice market. It is also learned that the rice industry is actively engaged in collective rice purchases. Zhang Nianxuan and Qu Zhenhua have sent letters of resignation from the Evaluation Committee.

### Shanghai West Police Power Agreement Expected to be Established by the End of the Month, The Public Works Department's Reply Documents Can Be Issued Within Days

A senior official told a Western reporter yesterday morning (September 13th) that the final agreement on the "Joint Police Power" issue in the road-building area beyond the boundary between the Public Works Department and Fu Xiaoan is about to be established. The Public Works Department's reply to Fu Xiaoan can be issued soon. It is generally expected that the problem can be completely resolved before the end of this month.

According to another source, Major Bowman, Chief Inspector of the Public Works Department Police Department, told a Western reporter yesterday that although there is a possibility that the "Joint Police Power" issue in the road-building area beyond the boundary will be resolved before the end of this month, it is feared that this will not be the case. Bowman said that all the work on the issue may not be completed within six weeks, let alone one week. But he said that the final agreement may be established by the beginning of November. It is heard that the Public Works Department's reply to Fu Xiaoan is expected to be issued within the next week.

### US Flagship Augusta to Sail to Shanghai Within Days

Luzon Leaves Shanghai to the West

The US Yangtze River Command Ship Luzon suddenly sailed out of the Wusongkou from Shanghai on the 12th. It returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. It is generally believed that it sailed to Wuhu in the Yangtze River Basin. All the US ships docked in Shanghai have left. However, the Asian Fleet Minesweeper Oriole arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao yesterday morning. It is heard that Admiral Hepburn's flagship Augusta will also come to Shanghai from North China before next Monday.

### Rewarding the Internal Transfer of Floating Capital, The National Government Guarantees Interest

In order to encourage the outflow of floating capital from Shanghai, the Ministry of Finance ordered the silver and money industry to absorb deposits in Shanghai and give them generous interest. And transfer its funds to the mainland, and the interest obtained will be specially allowed to be withdrawn in Shanghai, and organize a silver group to gather capital and directly invest in profitable industries in the mainland. If there are losses or the dividends are insufficient to cover the official interest, the government will compensate. The details have been seen in previous reports. At present, the reason why floating capital in Shanghai is unwilling to flow inward is actually because the speculative profits are particularly high. Now, watching the changes in the speculative market in Shanghai confirms the unreliability of "speculative safety". Speculators have made it clear that there is a risk of stirring up trouble. Moreover, the world situation is changing unpredictably, and all countries have the possibility of getting involved in the vortex of war. The trend of speculation will inevitably gradually subside in the future. Holders of capital have already taken the level of interest as the only standard for placing funds.

### Major Real Estate: Exports Surge, Reaching 60 Million Yuan Annually; Northwest Freight Smooth

Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Nationalist Government has been making every effort to encourage the export of various major domestic products to earn foreign exchange and replenish war funds. According to statistics released by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, major domestic products sold overseas under government control, such as silk, tea, tung oil, bristles, pig iron, antimony, and tin, have reached 60 million yuan annually. Although freight in Vietnam has been obstructed recently, exports via the Northwest international route are still very smooth. This shows that the government's policy of encouraging the export of domestic products has achieved significant results and is expected to continue to progress. According to a report from the Chinese Maritime Customs, the total value of exports in the first six months of this year has more than doubled compared to the same period last year. The export value for the same period last year was 411,610,262 yuan, while the first six months of this year have increased to 934,585,151 yuan, which also proves the increasing export of various major domestic products.

### Advocating Savings on Mid-Autumn Festival Feast Expenses; Donating to Price Stabilization

Mr. Huang Yuzhai, the manager of the Huizhong Bank in this city, recently, in view of the widespread famine and cries for food, and the fact that the small citizens of Shanghai cannot support themselves, although price stabilization associations and civil food regulation associations have been established, the future is long and the rice shortage has not ended. The more funds for price stabilization, the better. Therefore, he saved 100 yuan from the Mid-Autumn Festival feast expenses of the Huizhong Bank's head office and branches and donated it to price stabilization. He also asked the old leaders of the two places to promote this. As soon as the call is made, everyone will respond. Briefly, at this time when natural disasters and man-made calamities are coming one after another, I grieve for our people, whose faces are all pale.

Autumn gives way to Winter in a flash.

The north wind is biting, and the padded clothing is not warm. Millions of civilians in this city are about to cry out in hunger and cold, with no way to call for help. We, under the protection of Heaven, are spared the worry of freezing and starvation. We should encourage ourselves, save on clothing and food, to seek peace of mind. It is a question of round heads and square feet, of the same race and culture. The rich enjoy delicacies and do not bother to eat them, and have light furs and warm hats and still complain that they are not warm enough. The poor have empty stomachs, clutching their bellies and picking at their hearts, wearing tattered clothes and crying in the streets. Is there such a disparity in the injustices of Heaven? Now, the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching,

Reunion and Moon Viewing.

Customs are passed down and unbreakable. Public offices and shops indulge in extravagance, and a feast costs hundreds of gold. The cost of a mooncake is several tens. As the saying goes, "A rich family's feast is a poor man's food for half a year." I ask, on this night of joy, when the wine is warm and the ears are hot, do you also think of the white bones along the road and the compatriots with dark faces and withered appearances? Those with even a little heart will surely stop drinking and weep bitterly, covering their faces and shedding tears. What joy is there to speak of? Yuzhai is falsely listed as a member of the price stabilization association and should

Lead by Example.

Therefore, I saved 100 yuan from the Huizhong Mid-Autumn Festival feast expenses and donated it to price stabilization funds. I know that the well is deep and the rope is short, and my ability is clumsy but my heart is long. This small amount may be ridiculed by the rich, but I hope everyone will think the same and every family will see the same. Then, there are tens of thousands of wealthy families and prosperous shops in this city. If everyone can use this as a starting point, then accumulating little makes a lot, and the results will be considerable. This will not disappoint Yuzhai's painstaking efforts to advocate.

### Roosevelt Wharf: Dredging Project Begins

The Weisfu Wharf on the Bund of the French Concession has been in disrepair for many years, and the accumulation of silt has greatly hindered the berthing of ships. The Weilihan Company has leased a small dredger to carry out dredging work at the wharf, which began yesterday and is expected to be completed within a month. The dredger can dig 100 cubic meters of silt per day. It is reported that the berthing of ships will not be hindered during the dredging period.

### Settlement of Labor Dispute of French Concession Night Soil Workers: Five Conditions

After many days of stalemate in the labor dispute of the night soil workers in the French Concession, both labor and management reached a satisfactory conclusion through negotiation. All 700 workers resumed work at 3 a.m. the day before yesterday, and the accumulated night soil in the alleys was cleared. A reporter learned from Ma Hongji on Malang Road yesterday that the conditions agreed upon by both parties are as follows: (1) All workers will receive a uniform raise of 4.5 yuan per month. (2) The employer must provide each night soil worker with a rain hat every year. (3) If a night soil worker becomes ill and seeks medical treatment at the French Concession Health Bureau, they will be exempt from the registration fee to reduce the burden. (4) If a night soil worker sells night soil privately, they will be immediately dismissed. (5) These conditions are temporary in nature and shall not be permanently valid. The labor's request for the employer to issue a subsidy of 400 yuan to the union each year was not established.

### Family Bread Price: Up 3 Cents Per Pound

The authorities of the two concessions, in order to improve the people's food problem, agreed with various bread companies to bake a kind of "family bread," with a retail price of 38 cents per pound. It has been sold for several months. Recently, the bread companies believe that the exchange rate is falling, and the cost of various materials has increased. Therefore, they requested to raise the selling price of the bread to 41 cents per pound, which has been tentatively approved by the authorities of the two concessions. However, once the market improves, the regulations will be revised.

### Defense Zone Issue: Not Resolved by Shanghai; Will Be Decided by U.S. and Japanese Governments in Consultation; Shanghai and U.S. Authorities Held Meeting the Day Before Yesterday

Although the U.S. official in this port denied holding a meeting yesterday morning (13th), it is learned that the commander of the U.S. Navy Yangtze River Fleet, Glassford, the U.S. Acting Consul General, Butler, and the commander of the U.S. Marine 4th Regiment, Colonel Baker, did hold a meeting at the U.S. Consulate General for an hour and a half on the morning of the day before yesterday (12th) at 10 a.m. According to the last time the Commander of the U.S. Navy Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Hurd, visited Shanghai, he held several meetings. Although the details of the previous meetings have not been published to this day, it is generally believed that the content of the talks is mostly about the defense zone issue caused by the British troops withdrawing from this port. Local officials still believe that the final solution to the issue of the defense zone previously managed by the British troops is being studied by the U.S. and Japanese authorities. The final decision will be made by the governments of the two countries, not by the local authorities here.

### North China Visitor Recounts: Foreigners Suffer Great Hardship; Foreign Goods Effectively Prohibited; North China People's Spirit is Resilient and Extraordinary

A gentleman who recently arrived in Shanghai from North China told a Western newspaper reporter that although foreigners in Peiping (Beijing) have been subjected to heavy restrictions and disturbances by the Japanese in North China, and it is clear that the Japanese are forcing foreign nationals to cease business in order to monopolize all commerce there, the foreigners are still making every effort to maintain their trade.

Restrictions on Foreign Businesses: Increasingly Strict

Peiping, the ancient capital, has seen a sharp decline in commerce since being controlled by the Japanese. Restrictions on foreign businesses have intensified, leading to near-shutdown of operations. For example, the Japanese side has recently imposed a restriction on foreign trade, prohibiting foreign firms from importing goods worth more than 50 yuan from the three northeastern provinces (Manchuria), and limiting exports to 200 yuan.

Foreign Goods Effectively Prohibited

Moreover, the recently promulgated currency regulations have effectively prohibited the import of foreign goods. Peiping's main business, the antique trade, has also declined. Furthermore, imports of overseas-made automobiles have recently stopped. However, foreign tobacco companies have not been severely affected, and American and British cigarettes are still sold. In recent times, many Germans have arrived in Peiping. However, their trade with Italian expatriates is also hampered by restrictions. The arrival of a large number of Germans in Peiping has prompted questions as to why they are going there, but no one can answer it.

The People of Peiping: Striving for Self-Improvement

The people of Peiping endure various difficulties and are quite capable of striving for self-improvement. Even during the famine, they can endure hardship and resentment. They seem to turn a deaf ear to Japanese propaganda. However, they therefore know little about the situation in Europe and China. All residents of Peiping are monitored by the Japanese military police, and are constantly summoned to the headquarters to be closely questioned about their activities and relationships with other Chinese. The Chinese are not allowed to listen to any broadcasts other than those that are purely Japanese propaganda.

Chinese Guerrillas: Fully Active

Throughout the Peiping area, guerrillas are constantly active. Some people feel that the strength of the guerrillas in the area is so strong that it would not be difficult for the Eighth Route Army to seize Peiping. The Japanese propaganda that the guerrillas are undisciplined "bandits" is sheer slander. The guerrillas are well-organized and have repeatedly inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese army and transportation.

Train Wrecks: Abandoned Beside the Railroad

Only a few Japanese soldiers are posted around Peiping during the day. At night, there are no traces of Japanese sentries, for fear of being captured by guerrillas at night. Fortifications have been built around the stations of the Peiping-Tientsin (Tianjin) Railway to prevent attacks by the Chinese army. There are many trains that have been destroyed, and their wreckage is often seen abandoned beside the railroad.

Anti-Foreign Movement: Bound to Fail

The Japanese are trying to incite the Chinese to carry out an anti-foreign movement, but the people are not interested in this. The so-called "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" is bound to fail in North China. It cannot be denied that the Japanese army in North China has deep trenches and high walls, and is well protected. The guerrillas alone cannot drive them out of the country.

### Xiangshan, Yongjia, and Ningbo: Bombed One After Another

The Shanghai Association of Zhejiang Province natives yesterday received a telegram from eastern Zhejiang as follows: At 12:25 noon on the 11th, two Japanese planes were spotted over Guanhaiwei. The Ningbo air defense post issued an air raid alert. Subsequently, the Japanese planes passed Longshan, invaded the airspace over Xiangshan through Chuanshan in Zhenhai, and dropped a bomb, which landed in the city, destroying ten houses, seriously injuring two civilians, and slightly injuring four others. After the planes wreaked havoc, they entered the airspace over Haimen through Shipu and circled, and then flew to Yongjia, dropping ten bombs, including two incendiary bombs. The city immediately burst into flames. After dropping bombs in Yongjia, they then rushed to Ruian and dropped three bombs. Afterwards, they passed through Huangyan, Ninghai, Fenghua, passed Zhenhai, Longshan, and fled out to sea. The alarm was lifted at 1:46 p.m. At 4:03 p.m., Ningbo issued another alert. Two Japanese planes were spotted in Haimen. At 4:15 p.m., the Japanese planes appeared to be attacking Ningbo, so an emergency alert was issued. Subsequently, the Japanese planes did invade the airspace over Ningbo city and circled twice, dropping 100-pound and 200-pound bombs, which landed in the rice paddies of the Sixth Bao of Yongnan Township, Mo × Zhuang. Fortunately, there were no casualties or losses. After dropping the bombs, they fled towards Longshan. The alarm was lifted at 4:40 p.m. Also, at 6:10 a.m. on the 12th, a Japanese warship on the waters of Shipu suddenly fired four shells towards the coast. The shells landed in the mud, and fortunately there were no losses.

### Shanghai British Community Relief for London Victims

Allocating 2,500 Pounds; All Remittances Sent to England, Including Donations

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the Shanghai British Community Central War Fund Committee, in view of the repeated bombings of London and the fact that there must be many citizens displaced and suffering, began fundraising this morning (13th) to be delivered to the Lord Mayor of London's Fund for relief purposes, and decided to first allocate 2,500 pounds from its existing deposits, together with all the funds raised from the 10th to the 30th of this month, to be remitted to the Lord Mayor of London's Fund. Red Cross boxes have been placed in the halls of major British hotels in this city, and the donations received have been considerable.

### Wang Songfen Donates Feast Expenses to Aid

Mr. Wang Songfen, manager of the Wang Dasheng store at the intersection of Xiaodongmen and Minguo Road, is donating 400 yuan from his 80th birthday feast expenses to aid refugees, to bring benefits to his relatives and friends, divided among the Relief Association, the Epidemic Hospital, the Pushan Villa, and the Jingjiang Guildhall. However, the funds for Jingjiang will be used solely for Jianbi Township, as it is Wang's hometown.

### Farewell Ceremony for Mr. Ge Bo by Staff of the Shanghai Municipal Council for his Return to His Country to Join the Army; Praising Ge Bo as Highly Respected by Colleagues

The "North China Daily News" reported that Mr. Fei Hepu, Director-General and CEO of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the staff of the Director-General's office, gathered in the Council's meeting room yesterday morning (12th) to bid farewell to Mr. Ge Bo, the Deputy Director-General of the Council, who resigned to join the army, and presented him with a silver gift on behalf of the Director-General's office. Several people raised their glasses to toast and bless Ge Bo, praising his high respect among colleagues, and expressing their deep regret for his imminent departure. Ge Bo replied, expressing his hope to return to Shanghai one day and reunite with his old friends. According to reports, Ge Bo has served in the Shanghai Municipal Council for four years and has recently resigned. He is scheduled to complete the handover on the 14th and then go to Malaya to join the British army.

### Saving Mid-Autumn Festival Expenses; Offering Funds to Relieve Distress; Promoting the Country's Future; Respecting the Lives of Refugees

As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, residents everywhere, in accordance with past customs, will celebrate the "Festival" in a grand manner on this day. The amount consumed each year is considerable. In view of this, the Festival Saving Movement Committee of this city specially appealed to all sectors yesterday to recognize the times and empathize with the country's difficulties. In the past peaceful times, it was permissible to decorate the season. However, at this time when the country's steps are difficult, and millions of soldiers are fighting bloody battles, and Japanese planes are wreaking havoc, and tens of millions of refugees are crying for food, continuing to hold celebrations as usual is tantamount to abandoning the duties of a citizen. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that all enthusiastic compatriots will completely transfer the unnecessary consumption of the Mid-Autumn Festival to the National Government to be used as consolation funds, or donate to refugees to meet their needs for living materials. The country's future and the lives of refugees all depend on it. It is reported that the Refugee Relief Association Citizen Group Fundraising Committee and the Refugee Children's Home have also issued proclamations, urging all sectors to save on festival expenses and donate to relieve refugees and refugee children.

### Gatekeeper Conspires with Kidnappers; Kidnaps Zipper Factory Owner; Li Wenbin Escapes from the Bandit's Den and Reports to the Police; Eight Accomplices Arrested; Confessions Obtained Pending Judgment

Li Wenbin, the owner of the Huaxing Zipper Factory on Kaifeng Road and a native of Shaoxing, lives at No. 48, Duofu Lane, Fuxu Road, and has many concubines. At 11:30 p.m. on the 29th of last month, Li was returning home in his private car from No. 111, Limei Road, the residence of his fourth concubine, when he was abducted by several kidnappers just as he arrived at the entrance of the lane. He was held for ransom behind the Zhaofeng Garden at the end of Yuyuan Road, guarded by a Mr. Zhu. Li persuaded Zhu with his eloquent tongue, and Zhu and Li escaped together on the 9th of this month. Li immediately reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station. After questioning Zhu, the detectives learned that during a joint meeting of the kidnappers, a long-legged, hunchbacked man with a northern accent participated. The man said that Li had hundreds of thousands of assets, and that after Li was kidnapped, he had agreed to a ransom of 20,000 yuan. However, the man said that Li was really rich and that they had to get 100,000 or 80,000 yuan from him. He also said that a Mr. Yu living in the same lane was also quite wealthy and that they planned to kidnap him as well. After careful consideration, Li realized that the description of the man given by Zhu was the same as that of Wei Yushan, a Tianjin native and gatekeeper of Duofu Lane, badge number 2459. The police detectives then arrested Wei and found a yellow uniform. The number on the epaulette was 2495, with the last two digits deliberately reversed. Zhu then pointed out Wei in the police station from among eight people, saying that he had seen him at the meeting and on the 3rd of this month. However, Wei firmly denied it, saying that he had worn the yellow uniform to gamble at the Lisheng gambling table on September 3rd. However, after investigation by the detectives, the Lisheng gambling table had been closed before September 3rd, which was obviously inconsistent with Wei's statement. Therefore, the police lawyer Li Zhishan filed a lawsuit against him for the crime of kidnapping and extortion. Liu Yugui, the judge, opened the second criminal court yesterday morning for interrogation. The plaintiff, Li Wenbin, stated that he had been robbed of 270 yuan in legal tender and a one-and-a-half carat diamond ring worth 3,000 yuan when he was kidnapped, so he retained lawyer Wu Peng to file a civil lawsuit as well. After Judge Liu questioned the defendant, he still firmly denied it. Subsequently, the court appointed lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend the defendant. The court then declared the debate closed and scheduled sentencing for Friday morning next week.

### Employees of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank Arrested

At around 3 p.m. yesterday, one or two Japanese suddenly went to the Zhejiang Industrial Bank at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Beijing Road, accompanied by police detectives, and arrested three employees. They are currently being held at the police station's political department.

### Young Woman Wearing Diamond Ring Robbed and Shot

At around 9 p.m. last night, a fashionable young woman wearing a diamond ring was walking along Kangnao Road and Yanping Road when she was suddenly confronted by three robbers who threatened her with guns. One of the robbers tried to rob her of the diamond ring on her hand. The woman resisted and shouted for the police, which angered the robbers, who shot the woman in the head. The bullet hit her temple, and she died on the spot. After investigation, it was learned that the young woman was Dai Qiao, the daughter-in-law of Dai Buxiang, the manager of the Dachina Hotel, and was 23 years old.

### Young Girl and Elder Sister Commit Suicide by Poison One After Another

A young girl surnamed Zeng from Liaoning, 16 years old, who lives at No. 84, Yugu Village, Yuyuan Road, in western Shanghai, and studies at Peicheng Girls' School on Xiaoshadu Road, took a liquid poison to commit suicide behind her back at around 9 p.m. last night for unknown reasons. Her family discovered her at around 10 p.m. and rushed her to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment. It is said that she was severely poisoned and her life may be in danger. Zeng's family discovered her elder sister, Huang Xiaohong (a 20-year-old native of Liaoning), also swallowed the same poison to commit suicide at 12 a.m. that night, and sent her to the Red Cross Hospital. It is said that she was lightly poisoned.

### Heartless Brothel Owner; Abandons Corpse

A brothel owner named Lu Chen runs a clandestine prostitution business in room 222 of the Jisheng Inn at No. 10, Lane 195, Fujian Road. She adopted an eight-year-old girl named Lu Yuxian, who suddenly died on the 8th of this month. The owner did not prepare a coffin for her burial, and instead conspired with Shi Wenxue (45 years old, from Yangzhou), a tea server at the inn, and Lu Miaosheng (51 years old, from Pudong), a police officer, to abandon the corpse at the intersection of Fujian Road and Fuzhou Road at 8 a.m. one morning, leaving it exposed. After being discovered by a patrol officer, the Old Gate Police Station was reported. The Western police chief Fang Te'er, Hua Liang, Zhang Xingyan, and Hua Erdao Tou, after a lengthy investigation, finally learned the whole story. The child's body was covered with scars, indicating that she had been abused to death. The police went to arrest Lu Chen, but she had already fled without a trace. Since Shi and Lu, in their official capacities, should have reported the discovery of the body in the inn to the police, but instead helped to abandon the corpse, the detectives arrested the two and sent them to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu requested a temporary detention because the case still needed to be investigated and Lu Chen was being pursued. After questioning by Judge Xiao Xiefei, he ordered them to be detained pending further questioning at a later date.

### Epidemic Hospital Report

In August, as it was the autumn season, the weather changed frequently, and dysentery was quite rampant. According to a report from the Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital yesterday, the hospital's diagnostic statistics for August have been completed. A. General Hospital (Wenjianshi Road) (1) Cholera: 40 people, (2) Dysentery: 142 people, (3) Appendicitis: 53 people, (4) Amoebic dysentery: None, Total: 257 people, 13 deaths. B. Branch Hospital (Haige Road) (1) Cholera: 1 person, (2) Dysentery: 25 people, (3) Appendicitis: 64 people, (4) Amoebic dysentery: None, Total: 147 people, 2 deaths. According to the hospital's doctors, Tong Zhiqing and Miao Qi, who spoke to reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday, the above diseases are mostly caused by careless eating. It is said that illness enters through the mouth, and disaster comes from the mouth, so it is hoped that citizens will pay attention to food hygiene. It is learned that the term will expire at the end of this month, but for the benefit of the poor and sick, if sufficient funds are raised, the clinic will continue to be provided. It is hoped that major merchants and philanthropists will generously donate to support this good cause.

### Exhibition of Qu Weng's Posthumous Works; Public Memorial Ceremony Held at the Gongdelin Vegetarian Restaurant

Mr. Ma Quweng (also known as Sui Liang), the respected father of Mr. Ma Junshuo, a famous lawyer and doctor of jurisprudence in Shanghai, was an official in Pingjin in his youth, and his political achievements were honest and upright. Afterwards, he established a political and legal training institute and served as the director of the Nantong Nursing Home. Mr. Ma was not only enthusiastic about education and charity, but also his epigraphy and calligraphy were admired by the world. Today is the first anniversary of Mr. Ma's death. The Chinese Epigraphy and Painting Association and the Nantong Shanghai Fellow Association and other groups have decided to hold a public memorial ceremony at Gongdelin Vegetarian Restaurant on Parker Road at 12 noon today (summer time), and exhibit Mr. Quweng's posthumous works to show their admiration and commemoration.

### News from the Xinsheng Women's Handicraft Cooperative

The Xinsheng Women's Handicraft Cooperative, established by the China Women's Temperance Union at No. 66, Xieqiao Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, in this city, specializes in making various clothes, knitting various coats and children's clothing, and manufacturing toys and paper flowers. The employees are all refugee women. Because the products are of excellent quality and the fees are low, the number of orders from all walks of life is increasing day by day, so the original employees are not enough. Now, more female workers need to be recruited. If there are refugee unemployed women who believe they can handle needlework, they can contact the cooperative. The cooperative also employs teachers to teach the latest knitting methods of various needlework arts and other handicrafts. Every night after work, they can also enroll in the Xinsheng Night School for free, which is a rare opportunity.

### Tram Company Cracks Down on Ticket Scalping; Ticket Seller Beats Ticket Inspector; One Ticket Seller Arrested; Currently Held in Police Station for Investigation

Recently, ticket scalping by the Public Concession and French Concession tram companies has been escalating. In order to prevent ticket scalping, a strict inspection method has been jointly implemented, and many Chinese and Russian ticket inspectors have been hired to conduct inspections separately, causing the ticket sellers to feel quite restricted. As a result, there has been much friction between the ticket buyers and ticket inspectors. It even came to blows at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Fuzhou Road the day before yesterday, and both sides were taken to the police station. A tram on Route 17 was thus stopped on the side of the road. Unexpectedly, at around 11 p.m. the night before last, a trolleybus on Route 17 of the Public Concession was traveling from the Public Concession to the intersection of Kangti Road and Saposai Road in the French Concession. Wu Caichun (19 years old, native of Jiangbei, residing at No. 44 Qingdao Road), the ticket seller number 422 on the bus, was caught scalping tickets by Feng Yimin (29 years old, residing at No. 2, Lane 154, Dagu Road), a French Concession ticket inspector number 38. Wu resisted and argued, and when the bus arrived at the terminal station, Dapu Bridge, Wu ganged up with two other ticket sellers and beat Feng, causing injuries. The patrol police arrived on the scene and arrested Wu, and sent Feng to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is now known that Wu is still being held at the French Police Station for investigation, pending being sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution.

### Charitable Basketball Challenge Receives Enthusiastic Support from All Sides

The charitable basketball challenge initiated by the Shanghai Philanthropic Center and basketball enthusiasts is becoming a reality, thanks to strong promotion by the media and enthusiastic support from all sides. To date, six teams have challenged Paramount, including Huqing, Huxing, Youlian, Liangxi, Qunyi, and the Guoguang Alumni Association. Almost all of Shanghai's top basketball teams are participating, with all the famous players present. Since these six games are individual in nature, the organizing committee needs to prepare six sets of prizes and game balls. An open call for donations was made to all sectors of society the other day. As soon as the news was released, responses flooded in. Xiexing Sports Goods Company at 1000 Avenue Edward VII, through the introduction of Mr. Qian Xucang, generously donated three top-quality brand basketballs, which are quite valuable. Mr. Li Xiangxu, a prominent businessman, also donated two silver cups, the larger one to be awarded to the winning team and the smaller one to the defeated team as a souvenir.

However, it is known that Mr. Wu Yiyun, General Manager of Shunlihang on Jiujiang Road, purchased 20 tickets alone and donated 100 yuan on behalf of Shunlihang colleagues as a donation to the refugee children's education fund.

### Water Leeches Swindle People

Outside the West Gate of Anqing, near the Daxing Bridge area, there are some unemployed vagrants who have trained since childhood to be able to stay underwater for three or four hours without drowning. Therefore, whenever merchant ships arrive at the shore, or when they see fabrics and other valuable goods, they invite several people to board the ship to buy them. Holding the goods in their hands, they deliberately crowd around to examine and assess them, and then suddenly fall into the water, causing both the person and the goods to disappear. Their accomplices then threaten the merchants, claiming that human life is paramount and that the family of the deceased must be notified and the county authorities informed to search for the body. Fearing trouble, the merchants often secretly pay money to settle the matter and sail away. In reality, the person who fell into the water has already come ashore at a secluded place half a mile away, and the stolen goods and extorted money are divided among the group. This practice was once rare, but recently it has become increasingly common and is even seen as a business. The locals call these people "water leeches" and look at them with disdain, so one can imagine how despised they are.

### Strange Birth

A woman named Li in Fengqiao Town, Suzhou, had been pregnant for three years. On the 23rd of last month, she gave birth to a son with regular features and a loud voice, truly a joyous event. The delivery was no different from normal, but the pregnancy lasted for three years before birth, so the alleyways were filled with rumors. The "Difficult Classic," the "Gynecology Department," and various other books mention that a pregnancy lasting thirty-six months is called a "dragon birth." Even consulting historical records, there are many similar cases, so there is no need to make it sound mysterious.

### The Forgiving Spirit of Jesus Christ (III)

(III) Everyone Needs God's Forgiveness: We all have sins, and we all have the possibility of re-crucifying Jesus on the cross (Hebrews 6:6), and we all need such forgiveness. Since we need God's forgiveness, we should also forgive others. Because Jesus once said, "For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins" (Matthew 6:14/15).

Each of us has several people who do not have good intentions towards us, and sometimes we cannot avoid suffering losses from them. If we do not learn from Jesus' example and forgive them, we will not receive forgiveness from our Heavenly Father. May we all emulate Jesus' forgiveness and reconcile with our enemies. If we have offended someone, we should ask for forgiveness. If others have displeased us, we should learn from Jesus' example and forgive them. Everyone has moments of confusion and cannot understand the other person's heart. Because of this lack of understanding, misunderstandings arise, and all the misunderstandings in the world are caused by "not knowing." Because of misunderstandings, "resentment lingers in the heart, and fairness is lost in the eyes," and people often seek opportunities for revenge, hate each other, and lose harmony.

"Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." This prayer of Jesus is truly an excellent example for us. He did not "only talk the talk but not walk the walk." Rather, he "matched his words with his actions and his actions with his words." He practiced what he preached and can truly be called a model of perfection. Therefore, we should accept his call to "follow me," rectify ourselves before rectifying others, forgive others at all times and in all things, and at the same time, ask our Heavenly Father to forgive our own sins and emulate Jesus' forgiving spirit of praying for our enemies and forgiving those who offend us. "Do not do to others what you would not want them to do to you." This is the principle of forgiveness taught by our idols, but Jesus' teaching is even more proactive: "Do to others as you would have them do to you." Since you know that you cannot always please everyone and hope for others' forgiveness, you should forgive others first.

Readers who want to know more details should write to the Literary Evangelism Society at 351 Love and Righteousness Road, Shanghai, and they will receive a detailed reply.

### Savior of Epilepsy Patients

— Moming

Nineteen years ago, a four-year-old boy named Eugene from the state of Indiana in the United States fell on the stairs of the cellar and suffered a concussion, fainting for a few minutes. Two years later, one day, he suddenly suffered a very severe epileptic seizure. He then had minor seizures every three days and major seizures every five days, even several seizures a day or lasting for several days. He spent seventeen years of his precious life in a state of almost constant unconsciousness.

Since ancient times, epilepsy has been a mysterious disease because its onset is too sudden. Ancient people regarded it as demonic possession or divine punishment, so the treatment methods were extremely foolish, absurd, tragic, and cruel. Even in the 20th century, with the extreme advancement of medicine, epilepsy remained a disease that humans could not control. Eugene's life was destined to be buried in this way for a long time. But thanks to a newly invented specific drug for epilepsy—"Dilantin"—this young man was finally saved. At the meeting of the American Psychiatric Association this summer, the famous Dr. Farring led this twenty-three-year-old young man, who showed no signs of illness, and proudly reported on this amazing treatment process.

Eugene began treatment last November. Dr. Farring gave him a daily trial dose of 7.5 centigrams of "Dilantin" tablets. In just three days, his epileptic seizures stopped completely and never recurred. The stubborn disease that had been deeply rooted for seventeen years was unexpectedly so vulnerable.

But Eugene, who was now clear-headed, was still not a normal person. He seemed to have had a big dream for seventeen years. In the dream, he had not learned anything at all, and his intelligence had not developed at all with the passage of time and the growth of his body. After waking up from the dream, the twenty-three-year-old still retained the innocence and ignorance of a six-year-old. Therefore, the educational rehabilitation of this big child became the most urgent problem after the successful drug treatment. Dr. Farring transferred this heavy burden to the famous psychologist Ellen and specially hired the experienced Mrs. Fariman to serve as the nanny for this big child.

The results of the enlightenment were unexpectedly satisfying. Under patient guidance, his nature and intelligence developed rapidly like blooming flowers. At the beginning of treatment, his mental age was measured to be 6.7 years old. Now, after retesting, it has increased to 10.2 years old. This means that in five months, his intellectual level has improved by almost four years. This proves that long-term epilepsy did not cause as much damage to the patient's brain as generally thought.

The reborn Eugene is now advancing towards adulthood. He finished the first textbook in three weeks and learned addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division arithmetic. He learned how to play cards and various ball games. He can also pick up a one-year-old baby and tease it in a game, as gentle and kind as any adult can play. Recently, he has even been able to dress himself elegantly and appear in formal social situations with grace. Obviously, he will no longer be a useless waste. The miraculous new drug has resurrected him and turned him into a promising young man.

He still takes "Dilantin" every day, and may need to do so for the rest of his life. But this drug does not cause him any slight pain. "Dilantin" has only been around for two years as a new drug. It is the culmination of three years of dedicated research by Dr. Merritt of Harvard University and Dr. Putnam, Director of the New York Neurological Institute. Before its invention, it underwent countless meticulous tests. After its invention, it was further put into clinical practice by doctors around the world, and "Dilantin" won the honor of "Savior of Epilepsy Patients." In the past two years, thousands of people have been freed from suffering because of it. It is no wonder that all American doctors unanimously regard it as an epoch-making contribution to the treatment of mental illness.

Epilepsy is undoubtedly quite common in our country, and the tragic fate of patients is probably even worse than that in foreign countries. Therefore, the arrival of this savior is undoubtedly what millions of patients are looking forward to. Recently, I heard that the Shanghai Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Factory has successfully manufactured this drug first. This is naturally good news for patients and doctors. I am happy to introduce it together here and also bless the epileptic patients all over the country.

### Unemployment

— Ding Liu

Dragging my exhausted body back to my apartment, I was immediately overcome by an uncontrollable wave of pain and sorrow. Like a small bird with broken wings, falling dreadfully from the sky, I really dare not imagine the terrible scene to come. I heavily walked into the room, closed the door, and sat blankly on the stool by the window, contemplation completely robbing me of my ability to think, and the air in the room also solidified.

The sky outside the window also had a grayish-white, heavy face, and the heat tightly surrounded my whole body, with turbid sounds constantly coming in from outside the window.

Filling my mind was the face of our principal, the face I will always hate. Buried behind a superficial, hypocritical smile, was such ferocity and cruelty.

"I'm sorry, Mr. Wang, please find a better position, because..." He smiled slyly, offering me a cigarette.

I stood there stunned, as a terrible shadow began to envelop me. I barely supported myself, calmed down, hoping to use three years of diligent work to overturn his prejudice. But this attempt was a complete failure.

A burst of children's playful laughter shook my nerves, and I suddenly returned to myself from contemplation, and I felt the threat to my survival...

Many chaotic thoughts rushed into my mind all at once, gnawing at me like small insects, and I really dare not imagine how to live.

I thought of a novel called "Unemployment," which described the sadness and bitterness after losing a job, and I couldn't help but force a bitter smile.

The steaming sunlight crawled past my window and gradually set in the west. I could no longer endure the heart that was about to be tormented into pieces. The surrounding air became even more stuffy, and I longed for distant lightning and thunder.

I rushed out the door and onto the street. I vaguely quickened my pace, with resentment and hot tears intertwined.

At night, I had a terrible nightmare... In the darkness, many ghosts surrounded me all at once, and huge stones pressed down on my body...

I woke up, and darkness was endlessly surrounding me. I did not cry, because I knew that the life of a young person is originally the most arduous tempering, and also, I knew that the darkness was rapidly receding, and dawn was coming soon.

Hawthorne Detective Cases

### The Dancer's Fate

— By Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 6 "Take Him Away"

Lu Jiansheng replied with a stern face, "Yes, but I'm not a fool after all, of course I wouldn't believe it. Later, I indeed got another piece of evidence—alas, bad luck!"

"What bad luck? Her actions were originally free, and you had no right to interfere with her legally."

"Yes, but I can't help but hate her. On the morning of the 17th, I called her house, and she didn't return home all night, spending the night outside—"

"Well, actually, this isn't a big deal. If you were in your wife's position, think carefully, then you wouldn't be so narrow-minded... What happened afterwards?"

"I rushed over immediately, but she hadn't returned yet. But soon she came home, and upon meeting, she clearly told a bunch of lies. She said she gambled all night in a gambling house and won five hundred yuan, and because she was afraid I would scold her, she told the servants to keep it a secret. Mr. Hawthorne, you don't know how good she is with words, I even believed her at the time. Later, I thought back and forth, and realized I had been deceived again. Sigh, I really hate her!"

Hawthorne looked at his face and said slowly, "Hating her is naturally a very natural result. But you can't seek legal help; if you abandon her, you'll have to pay alimony, and it would also be very embarrassing on the face; the best way to vent your anger is to simply beat her to death. Isn't it?"

Lu Jiansheng suddenly opened his eyes wide and shook his head, saying, "No, I didn't beat her to death. I do know who killed her."

As soon as Ni Jinshou heard this, he suddenly turned his face to look at the banker. "What, Mr. Lu, do you know who the murderer is? Why didn't you tell us earlier?"

Lu Jiansheng stammered, "This is what detectives are supposed to do. You should find it out yourselves—"

Hawthorne glanced at Ni Jinshou. "Jinshou, don't interrupt... Who is the murderer?"

Lu Jiansheng replied, "It's that guy surnamed Zhao!"

Hawthorne did not seem surprised by this emphatic report. He still asked faintly, "What evidence is there?"

Lu Jiansheng said, "Yesterday evening, Lilan and I were eating dinner at the Baimei Restaurant. We were sitting in a private room, just the two of us. About halfway through the meal, the two flexible half-doors suddenly opened slightly, and Lilan's body suddenly shook, almost screaming. I was of course also startled. Although I didn't see the face of the person in the crack of the door, there was clearly a man wearing a dark gray suit under the half-door. I quickly stood up, wanting to chase out to see who it was. But Lilan held me back. Of course I asked her who she saw. She said, 'It's an unfamiliar person, probably went to the wrong room, it's nothing.' Because the tone of her voice, and that unnatural forced smile, both revealed her secret thoughts. I knew this person was surnamed Zhao."

### Chaplin's Angel: Paulette Goddard's Success Story

— Qinghui

Several years ago, Charlie Chaplin traveled around the world, passing through Shanghai. I remember he brought a girlfriend, young, lively, and beautiful, who was Paulette Goddard. Later, he returned home tired of traveling. Immediately, rumors of their secret marriage spread, but Chaplin was eccentric by nature, and Ms. Goddard was also a mysterious woman, so whether they were officially married is still a mystery. Let's leave this aside for now and talk about Paulette Goddard's success story.

A Girl Next Door

She was born in Long Island, USA. She came from a modest family. Initially, she studied in a small town nearby. She refused to study hard and was always fooling around. One day, she performed on stage at a school entertainment event, and she discovered her interest in acting, which ignited her ambition to enter the stage. When she was fifteen years old, her parents allowed her to play a supporting role in "Rio Rita," but this did not achieve any special success.

Instant Fame

However, it caught the attention of Charlie Chaplin, and they formed a deep friendship, frequenting nightclubs together. At the same time, he trained her day and night, polished her skills, and put her on the silver screen, giving her the leading role in "Modern Times," thus achieving instant fame. From then on, she wore elaborate makeup and glamorous attire, with graceful manners and a wide circle of friends. At that time, she was the most enviable woman in Hollywood, satisfied in every way.

Value Emotion and Gratitude

However, Ms. Goddard is a woman who does not forget loyalty and repays kindness. Although the words "repay kindness" are an unprecedented virtue in Hollywood, Goddard is indeed a person who values emotion and is grateful. She is not only grateful to Chaplin for promoting her to the silver screen, but also grateful for the kindness Chaplin showed her on a daily basis. Therefore, remembering the source when drinking water, she had no choice but to be deeply grateful to Chaplin.

A Collection of Works

Although Goddard has been in Hollywood for nine years, she has had few opportunities to appear on the screen. Since "Modern Times," she has been silent for four years. Until last year, she gritted her teeth and worked hard to strive for a bright future. She first co-starred with Janet Gaynor in "Dramatic School" and with Luise Rainer in "Dramatic School," and with Norma Shearer in "The Women". In addition to "The Great Dictator," which she co-starred with Chaplin again, her recent new works include "North West Mounted Police", a great masterpiece directed by Cecil B. DeMille, originally planned to be starred by Vivien Leigh or Marlene Dietrich, but this opportunity was obtained by this long-buried talented actress. Indeed, Ms. Goddard's future is truly limitless!

### Text and Illustration of Martial Arts Scented Ball

— Zheng Yaozu

Every week I read Mr. Dong Yunxiu and Mr. Yanyan's joint work, "Twenty Kinds of Storytelling," and it has a unique flavor. Especially that illustration with crisp, bold, and tight lines fully reveals the faces and scenes of talented scholars and beautiful ladies in a vivid way. Compared to the comic books in street libraries—small book stalls, it is simply worlds apart.

Martial Arts Scented Ball is the last of the twenty kinds. The illustration is a "One Horse, Two Burdens" picture of Long Guanbao and Zhang Guiying. Although I am a young boy, I also like to listen to storytelling. I remember listening to Zhou Yuquan's Martial Arts Scented Ball at the Oriental Bookstore until Zhang Guiying rescued Long Guanbao, and when they rode "One Horse, Two Burdens," Zhou Yuquan said that Long Guanbao was riding backwards on the horse at that time. And he was tied back-to-back with Zhang Guiying with a rope. According to him, this was because Long Guanbao was a weak scholar and could not withstand the bumps and shocks of the horse running and jumping, preventing him from falling off the horse; and secondly, Zhang Guiying was afraid that Long Guanbao would take improper actions with his hands on the horse's back after escaping with his life. It is not unreasonable to say so, but it needs to be verified. Mr. Yanyan, do you also think it has reference value?

### The Power of Film Propaganda

— Ming

Since the outbreak of the European War, the belligerent countries have tried their best to use films as a propaganda tool. Germany, in order to encourage the people in the western part of Poland it occupied to move to central Poland, has made a propaganda film, which has recently been completed. The content described, of course, is the joyful situation of the people in western Poland moving to central Poland. In fact, it is not difficult to imagine the inner pain of these poor Poles, supporting the old and carrying the young, leaving their ancestral homes inherited from generation to generation, and trekking long distances to the unfamiliar central region. It is said that the actors who played "Polish farmers" in this film were only greedy for the generous rewards.

Opening Method, Game 69, Black Moves First

Cannon 2 to 5, Horse 2 advances to 3, Horse 2 advances to 3, Horse 8 advances to 9, Pawn 5 advances 1 (Variation)

Elephant 3 advances 1, Pawn 5 advances 1, Soldier 5 advances 1, Rook 1 moves to 2, Rook 9 moves to 8

Rook 2 advances 5, Advisor 4 advances 5, Rook 2 moves to 5, Cannon 2 moves to 1, Horse 8 advances to 7

Rook 1 moves to 2, Cannon 8 moves to 9, Rook 2 advances 6, Rook 9 moves to 8, Rook 2 moves to 3

Horse 7 advances 5 (Variation), Rook 3 retreats 2, Rook 5 moves to 7, Soldier 3 advances 1, Rook 8 advances 7

Explanation: This game is a single horse defense against a central cannon formation. At this point in the diagram, Black has a significant first-mover advantage. Red must defend well, otherwise they will be taken advantage of. Traditionally, Red's Elephant 3 advancing 1 seems like a standard move, but Black uses a central attack, and if the response is not careful, it will be difficult to equalize the situation. Red's Rook 3 retreating 2, if they move Cannon 1 advances 4, then Black's Horse 5 advances 6, Rook 3 retreats 2, Horse 6 advances 7, Cannon 8 moves to 3, Rook 5 moves to 7, then Black wins. Also, Pawn 5 advances 1 is a variation. To be continued in the next issue.
