### Negotiations with Japan Continue; Vietnamese Authorities Gradually Conceding; Most of Japan's Demands Have Been Agreed to by the Governor-General; Executive Yuan Meeting Discusses How to Deal with the Situation in Vietnam

Chungking: According to recent news received regarding the situation in Vietnam, it is hinted that although the French-Japanese negotiations are still continuing in Hanoi, Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam has expressed agreement with most of Japan's demands. Only one or two points are still under discussion. According to intelligence received here, it is generally believed that Decoux will eventually accept the remaining points, and it is thought that Decoux may have adopted a firm stance some time ago, but after Vichy pressured him to accept Japan's demands, there are now signs of gradual concessions. As for the claim that Decoux may refuse Vichy's instructions, most people here do not believe it. It is said that Decoux and the Pétain government may have different opinions on certain points, but the opportunity to openly resist Vichy's orders seems still very distant. It is also disbelieved here that American bombers have flown to Vietnam. Although the situation in Vietnam appears calm on the surface, the Chinese continue to closely monitor its development.

Chungking: This morning's Executive Yuan meeting discussed the Vietnam issue in great detail and decided on measures to deal with it. (10th dispatch)

Hong Kong: According to reliable sources, negotiations between the French authorities in Vietnam and Major General Nishihara, the leader of the Japanese inspection team, are currently ongoing. It is heard that Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam has proposed a counter-proposal regarding Japan's demand to pass troops through Vietnam to the Chinese border, which was then sent to Tokyo by Nishihara for instructions. It is said that the Governor-General's counter-proposal seeks to restrict and designate the landing points for Japanese troops, the areas where Japanese troops can engage in military operations, and the locations to be used as air force bases. Chinese sources commented on this news, saying that they firmly believe that the Chinese military authorities have completed meticulous preparations to deal with all contingencies. However, if Vietnam allows Japanese troops to land, no matter how the areas of activity are technically stipulated, it will gradually become impossible to restrict the Japanese military's actions. As a result, Vietnam's independence seems to be under serious threat. (10th Reuters dispatch)

Chungking: Reliable foreign sources claim that, according to direct news from Vietnam, Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam has a firm attitude in negotiations with Japan and is prepared to resist the landing of Japanese troops. However, Vichy, apparently under German influence, is said to be exerting strong pressure on Decoux to accept Japan's demands. (10th Reuters dispatch)

Kunming: The claim that France has accepted Japan's demand to pass troops through Vietnam has not yet been confirmed here. French officials here have received a telegram signed by Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam, stating that there is no news regarding this compromise. Chinese officials have also not received information from Vietnam on this matter. It is said that they have received news stating that a small team of Japanese troops intruded into French territory near Dong Dang twice last week. The first time, the French side issued a warning. The second time, on September 7, more than a dozen armed Japanese soldiers crossed the border. The French side disarmed them and escorted them out of the country. It is heard that Nishihara, the leader of the Japanese inspection team, formally apologized to the French authorities for this accidental incident. (10th Reuters dispatch)

Hanoi: French-Japanese negotiations here were suspended on Saturday morning, but it is expected that they will resume today. The resumption of negotiations will depend on the orders from Tokyo. Tokyo's attitude may change depending on the impact of Germany's actions in Europe on the Far East. (10th United Press dispatch)

Geneva: Regarding the situation in Annam, the "Petit Parisien" newspaper yesterday published an official statement saying, "Regarding the various contradictory rumors circulating about the French-Japanese negotiations in Annam, the French authorities neither deny nor confirm them, only stating that although these rumors are close to the truth, they often contain prejudice. The more accurate fact is that the establishment of the Franco-German armistice will have some impact on the situation in the Far East. We can still remember that the British withdrew their garrison from Tianjin and Shanghai and went on to start friendly negotiations with Japan. The attitude of the United States can be understood from the recent statement by the US Secretary of State, which expressed a desire to maintain the status quo in the Far East. As far as France is concerned, it has always maintained friendly relations with Japan, so its purpose is to find a permanent basis to prevent the Sino-Japanese war from spreading to Annam. The negotiations in Tokyo between the French Ambassador to Japan, Henri, and the Japanese Foreign Minister, Matsuoka, started from this point. At the same time, negotiations between Lieutenant General Decoux and General Nishihara are also being held in Annam. The negotiations in Hanoi aim to find possible ways to implement the discussions in Tokyo. The negotiations in Hanoi often provoke erroneous comments. In fact, the negotiations between the two sides have never been interrupted, and they are now striving for a solution that satisfies both sides. It can now be assumed that Japan's interests are in line with France's interests. In accordance with the provisions of the armistice, France's task is to manage its interests." (10th Reuter dispatch)

Hanoi: After the new French Colonial Minister, Rear Admiral Platon, took office, Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam sent a telegram of respect today, expressing that all the monarchs and people of Vietnam are united in their loyalty to France. The message stated, "On behalf of the monarchs of all protectorates and the people of Vietnam, and in my personal name, I assure you that all of Vietnam is completely loyal to France. Although the current general situation is unstable, Vietnam will be able to maintain calmness, unity, and discipline." Colonial Minister Platon replied with a telegram of thanks, which stated, "I am very pleased to receive your telegram. Vietnam's loyalty to France is particularly important in the current circumstances. The government and Marshal Pétain have complete trust in you. I am very happy to hear that the people of Vietnam are calm as usual and united under your leadership." In addition, Lieutenant General Decoux hosted a banquet at noon today to entertain the chief Japanese representative, General Nishihara, and invited many important French and Japanese figures to attend.

Chungking: Authoritative Chinese sources say that ninety Japanese warships and one hundred and fifty Japanese aircraft have been concentrated in the Hainan Island area.

### The Glorious Achievements of the Eighth Route Army Attacking Japanese Troops in North China; Mobilized One Hundred and Fifty Regiments; Recovered Forty-Six Strongholds

Chungking: According to Chinese sources, the Eighth Route Army mobilized the strength of 105 regiments this time and launched an attack on the Japanese army in various parts of North China, and has captured 46 large and small strongholds. The motive for this offensive was that the Japanese army transferred some troops from within the country and outside the customs to cooperate with the troops currently fighting in China, and concentrated them in southern Shanxi, Hankou, and Hainan Island respectively, in an attempt to carry out a strategic general offensive in order to end the war. Therefore, the Eighth Route Army preemptively launched a counter-attack to contain them. Because the autumn harvest is imminent, in order to prevent the Japanese army from destroying crops, an offensive was adopted to protect the harvest. (9th Havas dispatch)

### Chinghsing Coal Mine Machinery Damaged

Chungking: According to military sources, after the Chinese army in North China captured the Chinghsing coal mining area, it completely destroyed all the machinery, electrical equipment, railways, and houses of the new mine in Dongwangsher, and diverted water to flood the mine shafts to a depth of more than twenty feet. The old and new mine shafts of Kangling were connected, so the old mine was also submerged at the same time. All the coal stored in the mining area was doused with kerosene and set ablaze. The raging flames soared into the sky and have not yet been extinguished. It is heard that the destroyed machinery was all made in Germany and was worth 30 million yuan according to pre-war prices. The installation process also takes half a year. The Chinghsing coal mine is one of the famous mining areas in North China, covering an area of 400 square li and producing more than 6,000 tons of coal per day. (10th Havas dispatch)

### Reviewing the Basis of U.S.-Soviet Cooperation

In recent days, news of U.S.-Soviet cooperation negotiations in the Far East has been circulating, but there has been no positive confirmation. Up to now, there has been no formal denial by the TASS news agency authorized by the Moscow authorities, as in the case of previous rumors of British-Soviet negotiations, Soviet-Japanese negotiations, etc. If we infer from this that what is being spread is true, then the international event of U.S.-Soviet cooperation, which the world is eagerly awaiting, may be realized before long and be witnessed by all.

Since the outbreak of the European war last September, following the war in the Far East, the camps to which most countries in the world have tended and the various relationships between them have generally become quite clear. The most unclear of these is the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. Because of the uncertainty of U.S.-Soviet relations, the following major questions cannot be confidently inferred: Is it possible for British-Soviet relations to improve? How long will the existing Soviet-German friendship continue, and to what extent will it evolve? Even rumors of Soviet-Japanese rapprochement, which are obvious at a glance, are almost impossible to judge. On the other hand, what will be the future relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union? Will it be further cooperation, or ordinary friendship, or continued coldness, or even friction and turning against each other and even open hostility? The future fate of the world will be greatly affected by whether it is one way or the other.

We earnestly hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will put aside their prejudices and cooperate harmoniously for the happiness of the world to save mankind from even more cruel disasters. However, we dare not make optimistic observations lightly. Setting aside optimism or pessimism, and trying to make an objective analysis, there are some things that can be said: that is, the United States, known as the leader of capitalist countries, and the Soviet Union, based on socialism, have inherent hostile factors in their systems and essence. From this point alone, if the two countries want to establish a cooperative relationship that is more advanced than ordinary friendship, they must have other solid foundations. From an objective review, are there any factors that can serve as a foundation to promote cooperation between the two countries?

First, let's look at whether there is a need. Since the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact by Germany, Italy, and Japan, until the eve of the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact last year, the Soviet Union urgently needed to cooperate with Britain and the United States in order to protect its own security. However, the so-called international anti-aggression front that it launched has been met with cold treatment from the United States from beginning to end. Britain happened to have narrow-minded and short-sighted stubborn elements in power, and even dreamed of brewing a "four-power pact" of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy to squeeze out the Soviet Union. The Munich Conference was its blatant beginning. Therefore, the Soviet Union was forced to make a big move and conclude a deal with Germany in one fell swoop, fundamentally destroying the international anti-Soviet front. Now that Germany and Italy in the West are doing their best to fight against Britain, and Japan in the East is tied down by the bloody war in China, the threats that the Soviet Union originally felt from both East and West have at least been eased for now. If the two war situations in Europe and Asia are prolonged for a long time without resolution, then during this period, the Soviet Union actually does not need to form alliances with other countries to form any kind of front. However, how long can the two war situations possibly be delayed? How will the war end in a way that benefits the Soviet Union? How will it end in a way that poses a great new threat to the Soviet Union? These are major issues that the Soviet authorities must have already considered. Not only consider, but also need to plan ahead and compete for the lead. With this analysis, I firmly believe that the contradictions in the system and essence of the United States and the Soviet Union are not enough to offset the need for close cooperation between the two countries!

Second, let's look at the broad attempts. The factual examples, such as Japan's coercion of Vietnam, have three meanings: (1) The economic significance lies in seizing Vietnamese resources, (2) The international significance lies in oppressing Britain to curry favor with Germany and Italy, and (3) The superficial significance lies in intensifying the aggression against China. In fact, only the first two items are a smokescreen. Looking further afield, if Japan's invasion of Vietnam is as desired, and if it progresses smoothly, then there is absolutely no doubt that there will be two other prospects: one is a basis for competing with the United States for hegemony in the Pacific, and the other is the revival of the Anti-Comintern Pact against the Soviet Union. These are the possible trends in the future, but they are the roots of deterioration in the near future. The United States and the Soviet Union certainly understand this, but up to now, there are still long-standing estrangements and suspicions between the two countries. That is, the United States suspects that the Soviet Union has no political ambitions in the Far East, and that it will not continue its anti-British and anti-American attempts in Europe. The Soviet Union suspects that the United States has no intention of seizing the interests of defeated European countries in Asia for itself, and that it has no intention of encouraging stubborn elements in Britain. These suspicions are the source of past estrangements between the United States and the Soviet Union, and they are also the obstacles to future cooperation between the two countries. Assuming that the two countries do not try to eliminate these suspicions, they will fail to eliminate various estrangements, and thus will not be able to establish cooperative relations. Not only that, but the existence of estrangements and suspicions, inwardly, will cause impulses, and outwardly, will instigate, which may lead to developments that are contrary to cooperation. If it develops unfortunately, either the two countries will isolate themselves at the same time and each be seriously threatened, or the two countries will be drawn into the vortex and form an even greater world war. Therefore, the elimination of estrangements and the elimination of suspicions are the crossroads of cooperation and hostility. We have no way of knowing how the United States and the Soviet Union will actually choose at this crossroads, but we feel deeply that the two countries have reasons to be frank with each other and work together wholeheartedly.

The above two points are to trace back from the common future encounters and destinations of the United States and the Soviet Union to seek the basis for current cooperation. From these two bases, to speculate on the speed of its progress and cooperation, it is inversely proportional to the views of the United States and the Soviet Union, or one of the two countries, on how long the two war situations in Europe and Asia will last. That is, the more they believe that the war situation will last for a long time, the slower the progress of cooperation. If they believe that the war situation may take a turn for the worse, then the realization of cooperation should not be far away.

### US Navy Department Announces Construction of 201 Ships; Costs $3.8 Billion; To Be Completed in Four Years; Contract Signing Opens a New Chapter in Naval History

Washington: After President Roosevelt signed the $5,251,000,000 bill last night to fund the two-ocean navy and a 2 million-man army, the Navy immediately announced that it had ordered the construction of 201 new warships, totaling $3,861,000,000, to establish a two-ocean navy larger than the combined navies of Japan, Italy, Germany, and the Soviet Union. This is the largest number of new ships ordered at one time in US naval history. According to naval sources, the orders include 7 battleships, 8 aircraft carriers, 27 cruisers, 115 destroyers, 43 submarines, and 1 repair ship. The Navy Department also stated that it is currently signing contracts to expand naval equipment, requiring an additional $31,653,000 in funding, and is negotiating the purchase of 2,400 aircraft. When various negotiations are completed in the future, the Navy Department will use a total of $4,000,706,000. According to the announcement in Congress last night, the seven new battleships each have a displacement of 45,000 tons. There are now a total of twelve American battleships under construction or on order. (10th Reuters dispatch)

Washington: The contract for the US Navy to order 201 new ships was signed yesterday. After these 201 warships are built, the United States will have a two-ocean fleet with a total tonnage twice the size of the current largest fleet. The decision to make this deal was only three hours later than President Roosevelt's signing of the supplementary national defense funding bill. Because Europe and Asia are in danger of falling entirely into the sphere of influence of totalitarian countries, it has to be dealt with quickly. According to the allocation of the above-mentioned new bill, the shipbuilding cost is nearly 4 billion US dollars, and the rest is used to manufacture 18,000 aircraft and to establish and equip an army of 1.2 million men. It will take four or five years for such a huge fleet to be completed, but small ships can start shipping in one or one and a half years. By the end of 1944, the entire US Navy will have 658 warships with a total tonnage of about 7 million. (10th International News Agency dispatch)

### The First Batch of US Ships Transferred to Britain

Canada: The first batch of American destroyers that arrived at a certain port in eastern Canada were handed over to the British here yesterday. After the American crew lowered the American flag, the British Marines lined up and boarded the ship. The British flag was then hoisted high on the bow, the British naval flag was raised on the stern, and the flag officer's flag was hoisted on the mainmast. All these are signs that the destroyers have now joined the British naval mission. (10th Reuters dispatch)

A certain port in eastern Canada: The first batch of 50 obsolete destroyers used by the United States to exchange for British military bases was officially handed over to British sailors here yesterday afternoon. The number of destroyers was not published, and local authorities did not allow journalists to attend the "Lower the American Flag and Raise the British Flag" ceremony. It is generally believed that the destroyers received here yesterday were all intact, because the ships had recently been assigned to serve in the US Navy. (10th United Press dispatch)

### Lieutenant General Tatekawa Appointed as the New Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union; Japan Seeks to Break the Diplomatic Impasse and Improve Relations Between the Soviet Union and Japan

Hong Kong: Tokyo News: The personnel changes in the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs are now being implemented one after another. In the third change of diplomats, Tatekawa, the ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kurihara, the ambassador to Turkey, and Yoshizawa, the minister to Canada, are at the center. At this point, one-third of the personnel changes scheduled by Matsuoka have been completed. Lieutenant General Tatekawa's appointment as ambassador to the Soviet Union is the beginning of Japan's selection of ambassadors from the private sector. (10th dispatch)

Tokyo: The new Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Lieutenant General Tatekawa Yoshitsugu, recently told reporters that he will have a heartfelt conversation with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on improving Japanese-Soviet relations. Although he does not like communism, he loves the frankness and honesty of the Russians. He has spent a total of thirteen years overseas, including six years in the United Kingdom. He firmly believes that he can get along very well with the Soviet Union. This military diplomat served as the captain of the cavalry during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 and made great achievements in battle. The first time he went to Moscow was in 1911 when he was passing through the city on his way to London. He has since been to Moscow four more times, but each time he only stayed for two days due to his duties. When he was the director of the General Staff Headquarters, he made friends with Soviet military attachés such as Primakov, but these Soviet officers were all executed in the Tukhachevsky case, so he has no old acquaintances in the Soviet Union at present. Tatekawa firmly supports the government's foreign policy. (10th Reuters dispatch)

Tokyo: The government's selection of retired Lieutenant General Tatekawa Yoshitsugu as ambassador to the Soviet Union has been approved by newspapers in the capital. The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" stated that the officer had represented the New East Asia Federation and requested a revision of foreign policy, so it was most appropriate to appoint him as ambassador to the Soviet Union at this time. The "Asahi Shimbun" mentioned that Molotov recently stated at the Supreme Committee meeting that the Soviet Union was willing to ally with Japan, so the selection of Lieutenant General Tatekawa as ambassador to the Soviet Union was of great importance. The newspaper hoped that the Konoe Cabinet would select new members to fill the vacancies left by the recent recall of diplomatic representatives, and then proceed with its diplomatic offensive. The "Kokumin Shimbun" stated that the development of the situation between Japan and the Soviet Union was worthy of careful attention. Lieutenant General Tatekawa was the leader of the New East Asia Federation, was extremely pro-Soviet, and would also have Nishihara Takehiko as his assistant. Nishihara had previously served as a counselor at the Moscow Embassy and was familiar with the situation regarding the fisheries and oil concession disputes, so he would definitely be able to fulfill the mission happily. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that the government's redetermination of its diplomatic position was aimed at replacing the pro-British and pro-American elements in the old school with experienced and unyielding diplomats who embraced reformism.

### Kong Xiangxi Urges Provinces and Cities to Establish Savings Corps by a Deadline, to be Completed Before the 15th of This Month, with Provincial Governors and Mayors Serving as Corps Leaders

Chongqing: Vice President Kong telegraphed the provincial governors and mayors in the morning, urging them to complete the establishment of savings corps by the 15th of this month. The thrift and savings movement for national reconstruction, under the personal leadership of Chairman Chiang, has been smoothly launched. The Thrift and Savings Corps for National Reconstruction was established on the 6th of this month. Now, in order to accelerate progress and achieve rapid results, Kong, the Chief Corps Leader, telegraphed the provincial governors and mayors on the 9th, requesting that they complete the establishment of savings corps by September 15th. The original telegram is excerpted below: (Titles omitted). "I have received a handwritten instruction from the Chairman on the 2nd, instructing that from (September 18th) to the Double Tenth Festival, an active thrift and savings movement for national reconstruction should be launched. During this period, savings corps should be universally established in all provinces, cities, and counties across the country, with the mandatory goal of each citizen saving a minimum of one to five yuan per month. Furthermore, (he) instructed to consider competition methods, and to detail award methods for groups or individuals with particularly large savings amounts." "The National Thrift and Savings Promotion Committee for National Reconstruction, recently established by the Four Banks Joint Treasury, in order to expand the promotion of savings, jointly initiated the organization of the Thrift and Savings Corps for National Reconstruction with the National Thrift and Savings Movement Committee for National Reconstruction established by the Central Propaganda Department, with the Chairman personally serving as Honorary Chief Corps Leader, and your brother (Kong) serving as Chief Corps Leader. Chu Cang, Jingzhi, Yuejun, Cixiu, Xueting, Wenbo, and other brothers serve as Deputy Chief Corps Leaders. Leaders of various ministries and commissions of the Central Government, various provincial governments, and various military units are invited to serve as corps leaders and organize savings corps. You are invited to serve as the corps leader for your province. The invitation letter and detailed regulations have been mailed. Now, following the Chairman's handwritten instructions to expedite the process, please quickly organize savings corps, and instruct all departments, bureaus, cities, counties, and groups to widely establish branch corps, ensuring that all are completed by September 15th, so that savings competitions can be carried out as scheduled in accordance with the instructions. It is also hoped that you will instruct them to consult with local four banks and postal savings and remittance bureaus at any time. Furthermore, thrift and savings are effective methods for absorbing idle funds and stabilizing prices. The Chairman pays extraordinary attention to this, so it is hoped that you will do your utmost to supervise the implementation, promote it widely, and report the progress of the promotion by telegram at any time. Your brother, Kong Xiangxi." Also, in Chongqing, the Savings Corps is expected to be established within days after continuous negotiations since the establishment of the savings promotion sub-committee. It is said that a meticulous plan has been formulated to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate. In recent days, various ministries and commissions of the Central Government have dispatched cadres from the thrift movement association and the savings promotion committee to explain the key points of widely establishing branch corps and assist in the process, which is also extremely active. Furthermore, they have all stated that although the staff of the party, government, and military are extremely poor, they should still do their best to advocate and set an example for society. The Naval Headquarters has specially sent Director Luo to the savings promotion committee to discuss the process, which shows the united efforts and cooperation of the party, government, military, and all sectors of society in this movement, and the expected results are very promising.

### Central London Continues to Be Heavily Bombed by German Aircraft: The Tower of London and Several Large Buildings Destroyed; Civilian Areas in the East End Turned into Rubble Fields

London: Yesterday afternoon and evening, the Germans continued to heavily attack London. German bomber squadrons dropped many 500-pound bombs on the center of London. London issued air raid alarms twice yesterday. The second one lasted for nine hours and twenty minutes, from 8:30 PM last night until 5:40 AM this morning when it was lifted. At least fifty-two German aircraft were shot down yesterday, and thirteen British aircraft are missing. However, it is now known that three pilots previously reported missing have safely escaped. In the air battles on Saturday and Sunday, a total of 103 German aircraft were shot down. A joint communique issued by the Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Internal Security stated that the Germans have now removed the pretense that bombing is limited to military targets. According to reports received last night, German aircraft indiscriminately dropped bombs over London without any purpose. Many bombs fell within the city and caused fires. Some fell near St. Paul's Cathedral and Guildhall, but it is reported that the cathedral was not damaged. A large maternity hospital was bombed, but fortunately, all patients were evacuated fifteen minutes before the hospital was hit, so there were no casualties. Densely populated areas in the east of London were repeatedly heavily bombed. Several of the city's largest buildings, including several houses on Fleet Street, were cracked and damaged. Residential areas in other parts of Britain were also hit by many bombs last night. Material damage in the shipyard areas was very significant, and many fires that started on Saturday night were reignited on Sunday night. The number of casualties in London last night has not yet been determined. The number of casualties from the German air raid on Sunday night was 286 dead and approximately 1,400 seriously injured.

London: Exhausted Londoners, after nine hours and twenty minutes of continuous bombing by German aircraft, bravely went to work this morning amidst an environment of water gushing from burst water pipes, destroyed tram tracks, and shards of broken glass scattered all over the ground, and streets and alleys filled with smoke. Hundreds of thousands of Londoners were forced to work. With every step they took, they uttered words of hatred for the Germans. According to the Ministry of Aviation, although German bombs fell on London like rain, they did not damage any military equipment. Piles of rubble and collapsed walls are everywhere in London, a scene of devastation, which is evidence of the barbarous actions of German aircraft this morning and tonight, and the most urgent air raid since the beginning of the war. The severity of the casualties is heartbreaking. The famous St. Paul's Cathedral and the area near the Guildhall were heavily on fire. A large maternity hospital was targeted by German aircraft, resulting in countless deaths and injuries. In addition to dropping heavy bombs, German aircraft also dropped "Molotov breadbasket" bombs, causing the capital's streets to be riddled with holes. Water pipes were also bombed, and water sprayed from the broken pipes into the streets. Tram tracks on the streets were also destroyed, and the streets were filled with potholes, causing traffic congestion. (10th United Press)

London: A British official wireless broadcast declared that informed observers believe that this month is the most critical autumn of the war. London and other densely populated areas must still endure night raids. British experts are now working hard to intercept German night raiders flying at speeds of up to 300 miles per hour, but this problem has not yet reached a satisfactory solution. The Daily Mail today carried a message stating that the British Ministry of Aviation believes that the outcome of the war will be seen in the middle of this month. It is expected that the German air raids on Britain will reach their peak within two weeks. If Hitler fails to win the air war by October 1st, the British Air Force believes that his invasion may be delayed or even abandoned. (10th International Telegraph)

New York: A report received here this morning stated that the world-famous Tower of London has been half-destroyed and half-burning. (10th Huitong News Agency)

German aircraft started bombing at 8:38 PM last night and did not issue an all-clear signal until 5:40 AM this morning. (10th Reuters dispatch)

### Bomb Falls Next to Large Hotel in London Air Raid Yesterday Afternoon

London: Between 11:54 AM and 12:18 PM today, London experienced its first air raid. Due to low cloud cover, the air battle could not be seen from the ground, but the sound of machine guns could be heard clearly. A bomb fell thirty yards from one of London's largest hotels, shattering the doors and windows of its dining room, but the building was undamaged. The passengers and staff, who took refuge in an air-raid shelter twenty feet below ground, were safe and sound and only heard faint explosions and did not feel any tremors. London issued a second alarm at 3:01 PM, which lasted only fifteen minutes, and the all-clear was given at 3:16 PM. (10th Reuters dispatch)

### Large Guns on Both Sides of the English Channel Exchange Fire

London: German long-range guns on the French coast, after two weeks of silence, suddenly roared yesterday, and shells flew to the Dover area. At the same time, London sounded its second air-raid alarm for the day. British heavy guns immediately retaliated, creating the largest cross-Channel artillery battle since the war began. British bombers also flew to enemy gun positions during the heavy shelling and attacked them. The severity of the tremors caused by the British bombs hitting the German gun positions shook the English Channel, twenty-five miles away, incessantly. However, the German guns continued to roar. After the new air raid over London stopped, the German shelling of Dover continued for an hour. (10th International Telegraph) London: German artillery positions on the French coast fired on the southeast coast of England today, luring away a large portion of the British Air Force that was previously defending London, making London's air defenses even weaker. During the 57th air raid on London by German aircraft this morning, which lasted nine hours, the German long-range guns also fired more and more fiercely. British artillery positions around Dover and other important strongholds on the British coast retaliated fiercely, temporarily silencing the German guns, but at dawn, shells flew from across the Channel to Britain again. Dover's artillery roared in response. The British Air Force and ground searchlights searched for German aircraft indicating targets for the artillery, non-stop from last night until this morning. (10th International Telegraph)

London: This morning, long-range guns on both sides of the Dover Strait continued to fire. German artillery positions opened fire first, and three shells shook the Dover area. The British responded by searching with searchlights for German aircraft spotting targets for the German artillery, and by firing long-range guns in retaliation. (10th Reuters dispatch)

### Fierce Battles Between British and German Aircraft Over the Houses of Parliament

London: A Ministry of Aviation communiqué stated that, according to reports received up to 9:00 PM last night, a total of forty-seven enemy aircraft were shot down on the 9th, including forty-five shot down by British fighter planes and two shot down by ground artillery. Thirteen British fighter planes were also lost, but the pilots of three of them were safe and sound. Last night, large numbers of enemy aircraft again approached the London area. The British retaliated fiercely. Although a small number of enemy aircraft sneaked to the north bank of the Thames, the damage there was minor. Bombs were scattered and fell south of London, mostly in the suburbs, and there did not appear to be any major damage. Detailed reports have not yet been received, but casualties are not expected to be heavy. A town in the Canterbury area was bombed yesterday, destroying several houses and killing several people. Dover was shelled last night, and British heavy guns retaliated. Several places in London were attacked last night. Many high-explosive and incendiary bombs fell in the western suburbs, and several fires broke out but were quickly extinguished by air-raid wardens and firefighters. Residents in west London saw a German aircraft emerge from the clouds and be pursued by a British fighter. It hastily dropped its bombs, then caught fire and crashed in the distance. Shortly afterwards, another German bomber was seen flying high over the Thames, and soon after, four explosions were heard. It is said that enemy aircraft also flew to the northeast and the Midlands. In a fierce air battle in the southeast yesterday afternoon, eight enemy aircraft were shot down. The air battle seemed to be directly over the Houses of Parliament. Londoners watching the battle saw a giant bomber, possibly a four-engine aircraft, hit by anti-aircraft fire and crash to the ground. One crew member parachuted to safety. It is widely believed that three enemy aircraft were also shot down in the air battle in southwest London. Two bombs hit a square in London, destroying part of a church. The church was built two hundred years ago. Several theaters in and around London have been ordered to close temporarily. London police are working hard due to the air raids, and no leave is allowed. Two bombs hit a museum in London, and the hall caught fire, and the roof collapsed. The fire was quickly extinguished, and it is reported that the museum did not suffer irreparable damage, and the valuables had been moved out several weeks ago. (10th Reuters dispatch)

### British Aircraft Groups Braving Adverse Weather Bomb German Ships; Berlin and Coastal Ports Attacked

London: Yesterday, large groups of British Air Force bombers, braving the adverse weather over the continental coastline, fiercely bombed ships in German territory and German-occupied ports, as well as the ports of Hamburg, Bremen, Emden, Ostend, Calais, and Boulogne. According to the Ministry of Aviation, oil depots and ammunition depots were bombed, and many fires broke out, causing heavy damage. Eight British aircraft attacking did not return. British aircraft were particularly fierce in bombing German ships in various ports along the French and Belgian coast. The Germans have recently erected many anti-aircraft guns along the coast, indicating their desire to protect these assembled ships from being spotted and bombed by British aircraft. When British aircraft attacked last night, they flew to their destinations through intense gunfire. Ostend was repeatedly attacked from before 9:00 PM until 4:30 AM this morning. According to one pilot, British aircraft braved rain, snow, lightning, and thunder to fly to drop bombs, and saw explosions occurring inside and outside the Leopold Basin, followed by large fires. A barge in the dock was detected by another team of British aircraft, and they dropped large bombs, causing fires in many places. Another basin was attacked near 10:00 PM, and the basin was bombed again and set on fire within five hours. It is estimated that a fire in one of the Ostend docks spread over an area of 10,000 square yards. Ships moored at the pier were bombed and exploded violently. British aircraft at an altitude of 11,000 feet also felt the tremors. Shortly after 5:00 PM on the 8th, British aircraft flew to Boulogne to bomb ships with considerable success. Soon after, another group of British aircraft avoided barrage balloons and gunfire and flew over Boulogne. One aircraft dropped flares, illuminating the port as if it were daylight, and then dropped large bombs, hitting the outer harbor and the adjacent pier. Three bombs also hit the inner harbor. One British aircraft was initially unable to find its target due to the bad weather. At dawn yesterday, Calais was also bombed. The Ministry of Aviation also stated that British aircraft encountered German fighters several times. One Messerschmitt Bf 109 German aircraft pursued a British bomber that had already dropped its bombs. The British aircraft flew out to sea, and when the German aircraft approached, the rear gunner suddenly opened fire with two rows of shots, firing fiercely, and the German aircraft fled. (10th Reuters dispatch)

### "Molotov Breadbasket," a Soviet-Style Giant Bomb, Used in the London Blitz

London: Yesterday afternoon, German aircraft attacked London for the third time. German aircraft flew low to bomb several targets and dropped "Molotov breadbaskets" in densely populated areas of the city. This type of bomb, invented by the Soviet Union, consists of a basket containing countless small bombs. After being dropped, they scatter in the wind like hail. The Soviet Union used them when attacking Finland, so Europeans call them "Molotov breadbaskets." (10th United Press dispatch)

### Romanian Prime Minister Accepts Title of "National Leader"; Iron Guard Leader Announces Political Program

Bucharest: Romanian Prime Minister Ion Antonescu accepted the title of "National Leader" today. Antonescu forbade any military agency or other organization from using the name "King Carol II" in the future, and issued an order removing eleven generals from their positions, because they lacked talent and damaged the prestige of the Romanian army, and these eleven cannot escape responsibility for Romania losing territory, so they were dismissed.

Bucharest: General Antonescu continued yesterday his work in organizing a new totalitarian government. The Prime Minister announced the appointment of four cabinet members: Rioceanu as Minister of the Interior, General Dubaru as Minister of War Production, General Pantazi as Minister of National Defense, and Commander Gennescu as Minister of Air and Sea. The fact that General Antonescu retained key personnel in the Ministry of the Army and appointed ministers who were former military men is considered noteworthy. According to unconfirmed reports from here, Romanian Ambassador to Moscow, Gafencu, fled from Bucharest to Sweden. (10th United Press dispatch)

Bucharest: Romanian Iron Guard leader Professor Horia Sima met with German and Italian journalists yesterday and made a statement, saying that the participation of Iron Guard leaders in the new cabinet is the only way out for Romania. A few expert cabinet members are only assisting the Iron Guard cabinet members. Sima claimed that the Iron Guard and General Antonescu have consistent views, and he intends to begin discussing various political issues with Antonescu. The Iron Guard's political program focuses on material construction. The measures of the previous government were decided by foreign countries, while the Iron Guard movement will be based on the interests of all people of the country. Sima then announced the outline of the Iron Guard's policies: (1) In foreign affairs, absolute cooperation with the German-Italian axis; (2) In domestic affairs, destroying the power of the Jews and securing the freedom of all nationalities in the country. Sima continued to elaborate on his foreign policy, saying that he hopes that Romania and Germany and Italy will not only establish a political relationship of etiquette, but also build a relationship of joint struggle to realize common ideals. Sima mentioned the Iron Guard's attitude towards the royal family, stating that the group is loyal to King Michael. Regarding the attack on the special train of the deposed King Carol and the arrest of former Police Minister Marinescu, Sima claimed that he did not issue these orders. These actions were natural occurrences in the current tense situation in Romania. (10th Huitong dispatch)

### The Truth Behind Carol's Abdication: An Analysis by the Soviet Pravda

Moscow - A correspondent for Pravda reports that, according to a report received by Krestinsky, the truth and background regarding the Romanian army's provocations on the Soviet-Romanian border in late August are now completely clear. According to a statement issued by the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs on August 30th, the Soviet government had twice protested to the Romanian government. Prior to this, King Carol of Romania and his associates had been negotiating the cession of a large part of Outer Transylvania to Hungary and were also discussing guarantees from Germany and Italy regarding Romanian territory. However, in order to convince the Romanian people, the King had to seek excuses abroad to conceal these facts. Therefore, King Carol's faction decided to create a provocation on the Soviet-Romanian border. Those participating in the provocation included not only border troops but also regular army units and aircraft. King Carol knew that if Romanian troops attacked Soviet territory, the Soviet side would retaliate. He used this opportunity to spread baseless rumors that the Soviet Union was preparing to attack Romania and that Romanian military forces would inevitably fail. The only solution, he claimed, was to cede Outer Transylvania to Hungary and obtain territorial guarantees from Germany and Italy. It is clear that the King anticipated that these events would lead to conflict between the Soviet Union and Germany. The statement by the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs on August 30th was published by various foreign newspapers, but it was not mentioned at all in the Romanian press. Clearly, King Carol's associates feared that publishing the document would expose the provocative actions of the Romanian leaders on the border. It is said that the current Romanian government is fully aware of King Carol and his associates' policy of provocation and has taken steps to expel the King and severely punish his associates. These factors are the real reasons for King Carol's abdication. (TASS dispatch from September 9th)

### Discussions on the European War (IV) An Analysis of Germany's General Mobilization Since the July 7th Incident

(3) Forcing the investment of surplus funds in important national enterprises, such as coal-to-oil refining industry, synthetic rubber industry, and domestic unprofitable mining industries.

(4) Controlling all new factories and shops, making them devote themselves to national defense industries. Those unrelated to national defense industries are prohibited from being established or developed.

(5) All industries are under the complete control of the government. The delivery of goods, raw materials, and foreign exchange of factories are all controlled by the government.

(6) All capital markets, banks and insurance companies' financial resources, and company funds are borrowed by the government through various means.

(7) The salaries of company managers and directors are restricted.

Regarding labor: (1) Adjusting the wages that were reduced during the economic panic of 1932 to give workers a fixed wage.

(2) Controlling various occupations, conscripting workers to engage in various industries related to national defense, and prohibiting workers from switching to higher-paying jobs.

(3) Workers have no right to strike, and the establishment of all independent trade unions is prohibited. All workers must join the Labor Front, which is an organ of the National Socialist Party, and its organization includes employers and laborers.

Regarding consumers: (1) Under the slogan "Guns instead of butter," all food and daily necessities have long been subject to rationing. People's living standards have been reduced to a state of malnutrition.

(2) Using direct government distribution and propaganda to promote the consumption of abundant domestically produced food to conserve consumption.

Regarding farmers, fixed prices and controlled markets force farmers to hand over all their produce to special control agencies on a regular basis.

This German system looks very strict, but it is not without benefits. The unemployment problem has been solved. The industrial production index, which was 54 in 1932, had risen to 137 by June 1939. Agricultural production increased from 10,000,000,000 marks in 1932 to 14,000,000,000 marks in 1939. National income increased from 45,000,000,000 marks in 1932 to 100,000,000,000 marks in 1939. The number of employed workers increased from 12,500,000 in January 1932 to 22,000,000 before the outbreak of the war. The number of unemployed, which was more than 6,000,000 in January 1933, has now become so scarce that it is necessary to employ some workers from the conquered nations.

The treatment of German workers has been slightly improved in many ways compared to the past. For example, workers can receive regular pay during vacations. If they are dismissed or insulted, they can sue in the labor court. Workers also have more leisure time. On the other hand, if a factory lacks raw materials or workers, resulting in reduced working hours, the factory owner can obtain industrial assistance funds and partial redundancy payments.

Farmers can also obtain low-interest loans, cheap fertilizers, and other supplies. The prices of agricultural products are also higher than those in the world market. The only drawback is that the food shortage cannot be alleviated.

When Hitler came to power, he not only had to deal with a large number of unemployed workers but also had to fight against the Marxist proletariat. Hitler solved the unemployment problem and also partially realized the psychological transformation of the German people. However, Germany's birth rate, which was 971,000 in 1933, had increased to 1,420,000 last year. In terms of manpower, it can be said to be the first in Europe after the Soviet Union. Hitler still has two major obstacles to overcome: the lack of raw materials and the lack of gold and liquid capital to support his military expansion plans.

Germany's remedies for the shortage of raw materials are nothing more than three:

(1) All foreign trade, especially various imports, is under strict control. Every international trade transaction must be approved by the government. The import of non-essential goods is only permitted in exchange for German exports. This new plan was implemented in July 1934, stipulating that Germany's trade with other countries must be balanced in terms of imports and exports. Therefore, every country that wants to trade with Germany must also purchase goods from Germany, even if there is no need to purchase those goods.

(2) Strict allocation of raw materials according to the urgency of various productions for national needs.

(3) Massively utilizing its domestic raw materials to develop substitutes, such as extracting oil from coal, extracting rubber from coal and lime, and extracting textile fibers from wood. At the same time, regardless of cost, developing domestic mines of poor quality iron sand and other mineral deposits, and trying to save raw materials in all aspects. The main purpose of the "Four-Year Plan" lies in this, which is also the beginning of Germany's attempt to complete a self-sufficient policy as much as possible to avoid being trapped by blockades. The success of Germany's policy can be seen in its arms manufacturing. Germany's arms production exceeded twice that of 1913 at the start of this war.

According to the most favorable statistics for Germany, Germany can obtain two-thirds of the necessary raw materials from domestic resources. What is lacking are a few important basic metals, which must be imported from abroad at any high price.

After the implementation of the Four-Year Plan, the production of various factories has increased. However, the movement to increase agricultural production has not been very successful. Germany is not actually increasing production but reducing consumption, reaching a state of malnutrition. Germany's self-sufficiency in food was 75 percent in 1932 and had increased to 82 percent by the outbreak of the war, but there is still a shortage of more than 50 percent of domestic fats.

In terms of financial problems, the solutions used by Germany are as follows:

(1) Declaring a suspension of the payment of interest on foreign debt in June 1933, which can save 1,200,000,000 marks per year. This measure can prevent domestic money from leaking to foreign countries, while money earned abroad through exports, shipping, and other businesses can be retained for purchasing foreign raw materials. In this way, Germany can not only purchase large amounts of devalued German stocks, which can be purchased for only a few cents per dollar, but also subsidize export goods. Furthermore, because German debtors pay foreign debts in non-circulating marks, the German government has a large amount of cash at its direct disposal. Creditor countries have also implemented currency devaluation to cope with this unfavorable situation.

(2) Germany also used its unique fundraising methods to issue securities and raise funds through various means. The loans of German provinces, cities, and agencies totaled 24,300,000,000 marks in 1933 and have now increased to more than 80,000,000,000 marks. According to some estimates, it is more than this number, and it is believed that German public debt has reached more than 100,000,000,000 marks, which is almost the same as the 160,000,000,000 marks accumulated during the four years of the last war.

However, the amount of banknotes in circulation in Germany has also tripled since 1933, with an additional 10,000,000,000 marks in banknotes and several trillion in public debt. Germany's domestic gold reserves are extremely scarce, amounting to only one percent. Therefore, although the German mark remains stable domestically due to the fixed price, it is practically worthless abroad.

(3) The economic prosperity created by the large-scale military expansion plan also allows the government to recover part of the money spent through a strict tax system. National tax revenue accounted for 25 percent of total income in 1932 and has now increased to about 47 percent. Various exorbitant taxes and levies totaled 14,131,000,000 marks in 1932 and have increased to 31,000,000,000 marks this year.

Germany's entire wartime machine, whether in the industrial or military field, has exhausted its resources. How long can this situation continue without collapsing is a question. But from the perspective of Germany's replenishment capabilities, Germany has placed the resources of the entire Europe under its control. If Britain blockades the entire European continent, waiting for Germany to starve to death or for a revolution to overthrow the National Socialist government, then German newspapers have already stated that it is not Germany that will suffer.

In short, the war has now become a confrontation between the two major forces of continental control and continental blockade. How the outcome will be is not yet possible to foresee. (End of this article)

### Ministry of Education Designates Universities to Increase Engineering Classes

(Chongqing News) The Ministry of Education has paid close attention to promoting science and engineering disciplines since the 21st year of the Republic [1932].
