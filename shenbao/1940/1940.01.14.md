### Situation of Soldiers and Civilians on the Hunan-Hubei Front

Changsha: During the New Year, this reporter traveled throughout the front lines of northern Hunan and southern Hubei, witnessing the joyful and enthusiastic atmosphere of the soldiers and civilians celebrating the New Year in a calm and composed manner. This year will be a year of victory for China and a year of destruction for Japan. The various activities of the soldiers and civilians on the front lines increasingly convince people of this: First, since the great victory in northern Hunan during last year's National Day, the Japanese troops in northern Hunan and southern Hubei have not dared to cross the Lei River one step and have been constantly subjected to Chinese attacks. The Chinese troops on the front line are still located in the areas of ×× to ××, covering a distance of ×× kilometers, which is an advance compared to the winter of the previous year with no retreats. Not only has the Japanese attempt to repeatedly strengthen the outer defense line of Wuhan been completely thwarted, but it also fully demonstrates that the Chinese army has entered a new stage of turning retreat into advance and turning defeat into victory. Second, under the command of Generals ××, the soldiers on the front line are able to conduct both combat and education simultaneously, creating an ideal environment where the battlefield is the classroom and the classroom is the battlefield. This spirit of continuous progress in combat is creating an important factor for inevitable success. Third, after the great victory, the people not only show no signs of arrogance but are also able to strengthen preparations and expand production in the midst of hardship. Farmers have begun plowing the fields and are competing to prepare for spring planting. This calm and optimistic spirit is an early sign of victory within reach. (Telegraph from the 12th)

### American Fortification of Guam and Japan

Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations of the United States Navy, recently stated to the House of Representatives that there is an urgent need to establish naval and air bases on Guam in the Pacific and requested an appropriation of $4 million to improve the island's defense facilities. A spokesman for the Japanese Navy Ministry, upon hearing the report, angrily criticized it, saying that the move was a very "unbecoming" attitude on the part of the United States. At the same time, Japanese newspapers also opposed it, believing that the United States intended to control Japanese territorial waters, which was tantamount to intentional provocation.

According to the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, there were provisions prohibiting the fortification of Guam, which was a diplomatic victory for Japan at the time. However, the Washington Naval Treaty and the Nine-Power Treaty had an inseparable relationship. The reason why the United States was willing to give up naval superiority to accommodate Japan was solely to maintain the Open Door policy in the Far East, especially the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty, as a condition of exchange. Now that Japan has openly acted to tear up the Nine-Power Treaty on the one hand, and secretly built ships with all its might after withdrawing from the London Naval Conference on the other hand, the United States is no longer obligated to abide by the naval treaty. The Guam fortification bill was submitted to the Seventy-sixth Congress by the U.S. Navy Department on January 3 last year, and it was really triggered by Japan.

At that time, Vice Admiral Hepburn, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy, also submitted a report to Congress, explaining that there were two reasons for the fortification of Guam: (1) Guam is located in the center of Japan's mandated islands and is only 1,500 miles from the Japanese mainland. It is the closest point to Japan among all U.S. territories. If a strong air force and submarine force can be concentrated on the island, the Japanese Navy, which is developing to the south and west, can be encircled. (2) When the U.S. Navy withdraws from the Philippines in the future, Guam will become the most advanced base in the Pacific, which will be sufficient to accommodate most of the U.S. fleet and facilitate the defense of Hawaii and the U.S. Pacific coast. Unfortunately, at that time, the U.S. Congressmen had different opinions on this case. Some people believed from the perspective of national strength that this move would extend the U.S. defense zone too far, which was not the most prudent method; some people were misled by Japanese propaganda, fooled by Japanese intimidation, and believed that this move would arouse Japanese hostility, and even lead to Japan declaring war on the United States; for these reasons, this plan was rejected. Until now, the old story has been brought up again; and it is said that senior officials of the U.S. Navy Department are determined to carry out their proposals. As for whether this case can be passed in this session? No matter whether it is passed or not, how will Japan react? This can be regarded as a test of the intensity of the confrontation between the United States and Japan, and also as the rise and fall of the barometer in the Pacific.

The so-called Guam fortification problem is originally just one link in the U.S. Navy's expansion plan. The United States currently has two goals for expanding its navy: (1) Geographically, to implement an independent fleet system for the East and West Oceans. Although the hub of the two-ocean fleets is still the Panama Canal, it is necessary to establish a formation that can simultaneously meet enemy ships from the east and west. If it is a single-sided confrontation, it will be even easier. The two-ocean fleets can be combined and concentrated in one area. Its strength is more than twice that of any country's navy, maintaining an offensive force of 10,000 nautical miles everywhere, and controlling the absolute odds of winning. (2) In terms of the international situation, because the European war broke out, the premise of borrowing the British Navy as a barrier to the Atlantic Ocean was abandoned, and it was assumed that countries such as Japan and Germany might jointly attack the United States and the Americas. It is necessary to prepare for contingencies. According to the U.S. Navy Department's prediction, if the united front of Germany and Germany is indeed established, and the U.S. military expansion plan can be successfully completed, then in terms of main battleships and aircraft carriers. In the case of giant cruisers, the United States still has a relative advantage; but in the case of light cruisers and submarines, it will inevitably be inferior. Therefore, within the Navy Department, those who advocate changing the shipbuilding policy and immediately changing the giant ship-centered plan to the light ship-centered plan are quite powerful; observing the experience of European naval battles in recent months, such as the Panama Canal Zone, Saint Diego Port, Elmeida Bay, the Alaska Peninsula, West Dejia Island, Kodiak Island, and the Pearl Harbor of the Hawaiian Islands in the central Pacific, the Philippines and other bases are all actively strengthening their defenses. Guam is the closest to Japan, and Japan is the most dangerous, and Japan's invasion of China has indirectly caused a serious threat to the United States. Therefore, in order to maintain Guam, to respond to the Philippines, to make complete plans for the entire United States, and to stabilize the Pacific, Guam cannot be ignored in the national defense plan!

What's more, the U.S.-Japan trade treaty is about to expire soon, and Japan does not seem to fully understand the determination and strength of the United States to maintain the overall situation in the Far East; and there have been repeated rumors from Washington that the U.S. government is considering the issue of banning the export of military supplies and raw materials to Japan after the expiration of the trade treaty; the combination of several aspects has made Guam's weight in the Pacific surge, and the valuation has soared. Recalling the beginning of October last year, the U.S. Navy Department sent 45 warships to Hawaii, clearly stating that they were used to organize a security patrol team. If American security is not threatened, why is it necessary to establish a patrol team? At that time, tens of thousands of people speculated that the intention was to prepare to implement an "embargo" plan against Japan, or even to imply the meaning of implementing a blockade. We are now observing the Guam fortification plan and the overall trend of U.S.-Japan relations, and comprehensively observing that this move is enough to make Japan's crazy self-esteem and arrogance self-examine itself, which is a possible function. Japan's relationship with the United States has long been in a stalemate. How will it cope with the dual difficulties of "abolishing the treaty" and "expanding the military" in the future, which is enough to be noticed by people all over the world; to promote Japan's pleasant ambition, the best thing is to plunder China, take it as a commodity market for exclusive dominance, and rely on it as an endless imperial resource, blockade it as a forbidden place, and as a warehouse; thus gathering China's gold and silver, buying American steel, expanding the military at the highest speed, creating an advantage over the United States, so that Americans who are pampered and superior from now on can only lower their heads and be humbled, only respect Japan and no longer respect themselves. The Pacific Ocean will become Japan's lake! Japan's education is like this, but China's war of resistance and the United States' increase in defense have made Japan re-examine itself.

### U.S. Naval Expansion Plan Requires $1.3 Billion, Navy Plans to Build Cruisers Above 10,000 Tons and Aircraft Carriers of 23,400 Tons

Washington: Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, recently delivered a speech to the House Naval Affairs Committee, explaining that the naval expansion plan proposed by the Navy Department requires a total of $1.3 billion, and said that the department may also ask Congress to allow it to build cruisers of more than 10,000 tons (according to the 1936 Anglo-French-American Naval Treaty, the construction of cruisers of 10,000 tons is prohibited). According to political figures, the expansion plan proposed by the Navy Department is due to the determination to make the strength of the U.S. Navy equal to the most powerful navy in the world under any circumstances. (Havas telegraph from the 12th)

Washington: According to sources familiar with Congress, the Navy Department is currently planning to build battleships of more than 20,000 tons. Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, said that the current countries' navies have exceeded the original proportional limit, so the U.S. Navy does not need to comply with this any longer. The Naval Affairs Committee may limit the caliber of the cannon to 12 inches, while the limitation on the arms reduction treaty is 8 inches (United Press telegraph from the 13th)

Washington: Admiral Stark, Director of Naval Tactics, told the House Naval Affairs Committee yesterday that the U.S. Navy will ask Congress to allow it to build cruisers of more than 10,000 tons. The U.S. Navy feels that the existing legislation restricts the tonnage of cruisers to not exceed the treaty's provisions. This issue is being studied. If the Navy feels that it is necessary to formulate special legislation, it will ask Congress to do so. The Navy is also planning to increase the type of aircraft carriers from 20,000 tons to 23,000 or 24,000 tons according to the proposed expansion program. Representative Renkes of the Republican Party said that the currently proposed naval expansion program does not list enough submarines. The Soviet Union, Germany, and Italy have 366 submarines, while the United States only has 46. Stark replied that the U.S. Navy currently has 65 submarines, although half of them are overage, they are all in good condition and can stay away from their bases for a long time at sea. According to naval personnel, the new program will allow the addition of 28 submarines, and according to the existing legislation, 14 more submarines can be built. (Reuters telegraph from the 13th)

Washington: The U.S. Navy Department is scheduled to start construction of two main battleships, two aircraft carriers, two cruisers, two destroyers, and five submarines and five auxiliary ships in 1940-41. After the announcement of this shipbuilding plan, the Japanese side was extremely dissatisfied and was recently commented on by the Star Evening News here, saying that the United States has no ambition for any country in the Far East or other countries, so it can openly announce its naval shipbuilding plan to the world, while the Japanese Navy Ministry is carrying out construction in secret, which is a better strategy. At present, the United States can only speculate on the strength of the Japanese Navy without knowing for sure. If the U.S. government intends to expand its navy to compete with an "unknown quantity," is it not absurd? In short, the U.S. Navy is not built for aggression, but it can be regarded as a threat to any country that harbors aggressive intentions. (Havas telegraph from the 12th)

Tokyo: Japanese newspapers yesterday issued a warning to the United States regarding the U.S. Navy's construction plan. The Tokyo "Daily News" stated, "The basic policy of the Japanese Navy is not to threaten or invade. The Japanese Navy will not allow foreign fleets to invade Japanese territorial waters, but there are no provisions in the Japanese Navy's plan for military operations across the Pacific. The United States ignores this basic peaceful procedure and tries to maintain an unfair advantage over Japan. Japan will obviously be forced to increase its fleet strength enough to cope with the threat from the United States." (United Press telegraph from the 13th)

Washington: Former U.S. Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Leahy, told a reporter from the U.S. United Press today that the fortification of Guam is necessary for U.S. national defense, because this can enable the United States to resist attacks from both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Because after Guam forms a naval outpost, it can contain attacks from the other side of the Pacific, so the fortification of Guam is in fact entirely defensive. Admiral Leahy does not attach much importance to the discussion of building an ultra-battleship, believing that there is no need for the United States to build battleships of more than 45,000 tons at present. In short, if the United States can arm Guam, and at the same time, the various battleships under construction are completed, then the United States can cope with attacks from Japan, Italy, and Germany, but this is only the case in the arena where the country has not become a maritime hegemon.

### US House Passes Emergency National Defense Funds of $267 Million

Washington - The US House of Representatives yesterday passed by a large majority an emergency national defense appropriation bill for $267,000,000 for the use of the Navy, Army, and Coast Guard.

### Japan-US Commercial Treaty Negotiations Cannot Proceed Due to Impact of Japanese Cabinet Turmoil

Tokyo - The "Tokyo Nichi-Nichi Shimbun" stated today that the current Japanese cabinet crisis makes it impossible to negotiate temporary trade measures with the United States to replace the 1911 Japan-US Commercial Treaty expiring on January 26th. The treaty cannot be continued, and the future relationship between Japan and the United States will be entirely determined by the United States. The newspaper stated that before the expiration of the Japan-US Commercial Treaty on January 26th, Japan cannot negotiate a temporary treaty with the United States. "Not only is it impossible to hope for a temporary commercial treaty, but negotiations cannot even proceed. The Washington government has the right to act freely and can unilaterally decide whether to grant Japan the treatment it previously enjoyed. After January 26th, there will be no treaty restraints between Japan and the United States, and the United States can take any restrictive measures to deal with Japan. Therefore, it is generally advocated that Japan's policy toward the United States must be re-examined and prepared to start from scratch." (United Press, 13th)

Tokyo - According to an editorial in today's Kokumin Shimbun, a state of no treaty between Japan and the United States is virtually unavoidable. Although US Secretary of State Hull has assured Japan that the United States will not take discriminatory measures against Japan after the expiration of the US-Japan commercial treaty, this assurance does not mean that the United States intends to conclude a new commercial treaty or temporary agreement with Japan. Therefore, the trade relationship between Japan and the United States will inevitably fall into a state of no treaty. During this period, the relationship between Japan and the United States will be harmed by irresponsible warmongers who advocate severing trade relations with Japan and greatly expanding the navy. Therefore, it is still difficult to say whether a major crisis will occur in the future in the relationship between Japan and the United States. (United Press, 13th)

Tokyo - The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun today summarized US-Japan relations as follows: "If we cannot have both the New Order in East Asia and a new treaty with the United States, then we must abandon the latter." Miyako Shimbun also predicted that the new cabinet following Abe will adopt a more hard-line attitude toward the United States. The newspaper said that there are strong demands for rebuilding the diplomatic front. According to Miyako Shimbun's speculation, the new cabinet will (1) continue to support the Wang Jingwei regime, (2) adopt a more resolute attitude toward the United States based on the current sentiments of the Japanese people, (3) actively conduct negotiations with the Soviet Union on border and commercial treaties in order to create a more friendly atmosphere between Japan and the Soviet Union, (4) implement strong commercial diplomacy, and (5) appoint a career diplomat as the new Foreign Minister.

### Saionji Urges Konoe to Form a Cabinet, Konoe Firmly Declines, New Cabinet Faces Difficult Birth, Abe Resigns Today

Tokyo - Yuasa dispatched Chief Secretary Matsudaira to Okitsu this morning to visit Saionji, reporting on the political situation and Konoe's opinions, and soliciting Saionji's views on the current situation. He returned to Tokyo by express train at 12:30 pm to report back. (Domei, 13th)

Tokyo - Regarding the policy for resolving the political situation after Prime Minister Abe expressed his determination to resign, Internal Minister Yuasa and senior statesmen, based on the wishes of the military, political parties, and financial circles, urged Privy Councilor Konoe to come forward. After the formal meeting of the Privy Council on the 13th, Prime Minister Abe met with Privy Councilor Konoe in the palace, and Army Minister Hata also participated. Furthermore, Internal Minister Yuasa also met with Konoe afterward, earnestly requesting Konoe to come forward. However, Konoe's intention remains unchanged. Therefore, senior statesmen seem to have no choice but to consider the next best option. Even within the Army, discussions are emerging about considering secondary solutions. However, General Araki, who is considered a strong candidate, is not favored by a portion of the Army. Therefore, the outcome remains uncertain. Furthermore, senior statesmen have a strong preference for Shigeyoshi Ikeda, but the Army adopts a negative attitude. As for General Shunroku Hata, military and civilian officials believe that he is capable of realizing the integration of military, political, and financial affairs, and they attach great importance to him. Although the Army opposes active-duty generals taking charge of the political situation, some argue that he may be placed on the reserve list to meet the expectations of senior statesmen. However, another faction still opposes him due to his position as a cabinet member of the current cabinet. Therefore, in this situation, General Sugiyama seems to be the most likely candidate. In summary, the intentions of the military and senior statesmen are not yet aligned. As a result of Chief Secretary Matsudaira's visit to Prince Saionji on behalf of Internal Minister Yuasa, Prince Saionji favored Konoe. In conclusion, it goes without saying that Konoe's emergence is necessary, and if not, the successor to the cabinet may not be decided by the 14th. (Domei, 13th)

Tokyo - Chief Secretary Matsudaira of the Ministry of the Interior, who visited Prince Saionji in Okitsu on the 13th, returned to Beijing by train at 3:25 pm and immediately met with Internal Minister Yuasa to report in detail on the results of the meeting with Prince Saionji and conducted various consultations. According to Chief Secretary Matsudaira, after Prince Saionji inquired in detail about the intentions of the military, political parties, financial circles, and other parties regarding the successor cabinet, he cautiously stated that he intended to sincerely express his views on recommending talents to handle the current situation when he meets with Internal Minister Yuasa within three days. At the same time, Prince Saionji also hinted that if all parties considered Prince Konoe the most suitable candidate for the head of the successor cabinet, he would also do his best to recommend Prince Konoe to come forward in order to ensure everything is perfect. Therefore, all sectors are paying close attention to Prince Saionji's words. (Domei, 13th)

Tokyo - Prince Konoe, after meeting with Prime Minister Abe and Army Minister Hata again on the evening of the 13th, stated the reasons for refusing to come forward at the Kazoku Kaikan as follows: (1) In view of the nature of this change of government, he believes that he has no economic knowledge, so his conscience does not allow him to take charge of the current situation. (2) The future political situation should not rely solely on prestige or lineage, this is already a proven experience. (3) Although the wishes of all parties to come forward are unanimous, they have different intentions on political ideology, and it is necessary to pay attention to them. (Domei, 13th)

Tokyo - Army authorities, including Army Minister Hata, Vice Chief of Staff Sawada, and Military Affairs Bureau Chief Muto, visited Prince Konoe again at the Tokyo Club at 3:30 pm on the 13th to convey the wishes of the Ministry of the Army and hoped that he would agree to take on the role of Prime Minister. Prime Minister Abe also met with Prince Konoe today, earnestly hoping that he would come forward. (Domei, 13th)

Tokyo - The Abe Cabinet is scheduled to hold the final cabinet meeting at 9:00 am tomorrow (the 14th) at the Prime Minister's official residence to settle the political situation within three months since its formation. After Prime Minister Abe conducted various consultations with Internal Minister Yuasa and Privy Councilor Konoe after the formal meeting of the Privy Council this morning, all preparatory work has come to an end. Therefore, it was decided that Prime Minister Abe would express the following determination at the temporary cabinet meeting on the 14th: "Japan's basic policy for establishing a new central government in China has been established. Therefore, in order to improve the handling of the Incident, it is the best policy for the current cabinet to seek a new look under new ideas." All cabinet members also understood and agreed with the Prime Minister's intention. Therefore, the cabinet meeting will be temporarily adjourned, and the government will issue a major statement in the form of a Prime Minister's talk after the cabinet meeting is adjourned. (Domei, 13th)

Tokyo - Army Minister Hata met with Prince Konoe after the formal meeting of the Privy Council on the morning of the 13th. Prime Minister Abe also participated and exchanged important views on resolving the political situation. From 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm, he consulted with Vice Chief of Staff Sawada and Military Affairs Bureau Chief Muto and decided to make a final effort by the Army to persuade Konoe to accept. Army Minister Hata then met with Konoe again at the Tokyo Club at 3:00 pm to convey the views of the entire Army and urged Konoe to make a decision. (Domei, 13th)

Tokyo - This morning, all newspapers stated that there was a lack of suitable candidates to succeed the Prime Minister. Key figures who have been called upon to form a cabinet, such as former Governor of the Bank of Japan Shigeyoshi Ikeda and former Minister Hirota, have not aroused any excitement. Only Konoe is more in line with public expectations. He may eventually agree to take on this position again due to the repeated persuasion of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Yuasa. If Konoe does not take office, more promising candidates include former Army Minister Araki. Some newspapers advise military and civilian officials to carefully select a new prime minister, as the weakness and various failures of Abe, who was previously recommended, have created a bad impression on the country. Miyako Shimbun openly stated that the appointment of a military officer as prime minister has created a difficult situation. (Reuters, 13th)

Tokyo - Chugai Shogyo Shimpo stated today that Japan's current economic difficulties require a basic plan to curb inflation. Specifically, the source of the trouble can be seen in the drafting of the huge budget, which seems impossible to implement. The budget should be drastically reduced, and various measures to prevent rising prices should be thoroughly implemented. Nichi-Nichi Shimbun said that no one is deeply concerned about the future resolution of the current situation. The people of the country want to have a strong cabinet with full power to achieve true national unity, which can only be achieved after the complete unity of the Army, Navy, political parties, and bureaucrats. (Reuters, 13th)

Tokyo - The Japanese government held the third five-party leaders' meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 3:05 pm on the 13th. Attendees included Prime Minister Abe, Foreign Minister Nomura, Finance Minister Aoki, and Vice Minister Anan, representing Army Minister Hata. Prime Minister Abe explained to the leaders of the five parties, including Machida of the Minseito Party, Kuhara of the Seiyukai, Nakaajima of the Seiyukai Orthodox faction, Adachi of the Kokumin Domei, and Abe of the Shakai Taishu-to, the outline of the basic policy for assisting China in establishing a new central government, which was decided at the Asia Development Board meeting on the 6th and the temporary cabinet meeting on the 7th, stating the gist that the handling of the Incident had entered the first stage, in order to seek the understanding of the five party leaders. The five party leaders then raised various inquiries, which were answered one by one by Prime Minister Abe and Vice Minister Anan.

(Domei, 13th)

### Roosevelt Considers New Loan to China Meets with Oil Tycoon

Washington - President Roosevelt met yesterday with Wofford B. Camp, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Oil Company, to discuss the issue of a new loan to China. Camp subsequently stated that he and the President discussed not only the loan issue but also other undertakings in China and the current state of the war. The Chinese government had already obtained a substantial loan of US$25 million from the semi-official Export-Import Bank of the United States in 1938 and is still working hard to reach a figure of US$100 million. Although the Chinese government is at war, its external credit is extremely high. However, Camp stated that the expansion of Japanese military operations may affect China's exports in the future, which is also uncertain. (United Press, 13th)

Advisor Ishii then raised a question, "Although it is noted in the wooden protocol that a formal treaty should be concluded within this year, I believe that this is being implemented depending on whether the other party has sincerity. Does the government have the certainty of concluding a formal treaty?" Foreign Minister Nomura replied, "The Soviet side has also agreed to the conclusion of a formal treaty, so the conclusion should be possible. We will engage in negotiations in the future." The government then approved the original plan with questions, and the meeting adjourned at 10:50 am.

### Hitler Hopes for Early Restoration of Peace Between Soviet Union and Finland May Publicly Suggest Appointing Himself as Mediator to Avoid Expanding Scope of European War

Amsterdam - According to recent indications, Hitler now wants to see the end of the Finnish war more than before. The main reason seems to be the fear that assistance from other countries to Finland may expand the war in Eastern Europe and concern that the Soviet Union's adventurous actions in Finland will hinder negotiations on German-Soviet trade. The German "Kölnische Zeitung" today carried a dispatch from the Swedish capital, mentioning mediation of the Finnish war to seek reconciliation. It is stated that "Responsible figures in Denmark, Sweden, and even Finland are now eagerly pointing out that now is the appropriate time to resume Finnish-Soviet negotiations under the mediation of neighboring countries. If this opportunity is lost, it may not be available in the future." Although the news did not mention the attitude that the Soviet Union will take, the fact that the German newspaper under strict control actually published this news clearly reflects Germany's hope for peace in Finland. This news also confirms the rumors that Hitler may publicly suggest appointing himself as a mediator between Finland and the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 13th)

London - According to news from the Finnish capital, the Soviet government is planning to agree to a ceasefire with Finland and conduct peace talks, but Soviet personnel here firmly deny this, insisting that the country is determined to continue using troops against Finland regardless of the consequences. Diplomatic circles here also expressed skepticism about this news and believe that if the Soviet Union makes peace with Finland after failing in the war, it would lose credibility, so it would rather prolong the war than show weakness to others. Political figures in the United Kingdom hope that countries other than the United Kingdom, France, and Sweden will be able to assist Finland in the short term. According to news from the United States, the US government plans to provide loans to Sweden and Finland, which is gratifying, but it is hoped that the legislative procedures will not be too delayed, so as to avoid the feeling of being too late to help, because although the Finnish army has repeatedly won victories recently, the Red Army still has the upper hand because it can continuously assemble new troops and transport large quantities of military supplies. Military experts predict that the Red Army will launch another attack on Finland in the short term. Therefore, it is urgent for all countries to step up assistance to Finland, so that the country is not only strong enough to resist, but also able to take advantage of the victory to counterattack. (Havas, 12th)

### US Government Studies Assistance to Finland Roosevelt Tells Congressional Leaders Not to Make This an Object of Partisan Strife

Washington - President Roosevelt recently issued a statement to the newspapers, saying that he has asked congressional leaders to start studying the issue of assisting Finland. The government has not yet made any decisions, but "Finland is attacked by the Soviet Union, most of the people are displaced and in urgent need of relief, and the country's independence must also be maintained. This issue should not become an object of partisan strife." But I am not in a position to initiate anything at this time. I will wait for the Democratic and Republican parties in Congress to reach a compromise on the method of assistance before submitting a message to Congress. Congressional figures are currently discussing a plan to lend Finland a loan of US$50 million to US$60 million and allow it to use it to purchase arms from the United States. (Havas, 12th)

### International Confederation of Trade Unions Passes Resolution to Provide Effective Assistance to Finland

Paris - The International Confederation of Trade Unions met here yesterday. Leaders of the French trade union movement, Shi Wu and Secretary-General of the British Trades Union Congress, Citrine, co-chaired the meeting and passed a resolution calling on all trade unions to provide effective assistance to Finland and expressed sympathy and support for the heroic Finnish people who fought against Stalin's imperialist aggression. (Reuters, 13th)

### British Aircraft Flew to Germany for Reconnaissance and Returned Safely to Base

London - The Ministry of Aviation has announced that last night our aircraft flew to various places in northwestern Germany and the provinces of Austria and Bohemia for reconnaissance flights. In addition, our aircraft regularly flew over the German seaplane base of Heligoland for safety patrols. All of these aircraft safely returned to base after completing their missions. According to well-informed sources, one British aircraft flew to northwestern Germany, and another flew to the provinces of Austria and Bohemia, the farthest range since the outbreak of the European War. (Havas, 13th)

Berlin - According to a communiqué from the High Command here, eight British bombers attacked German destroyers off Heligoland, one of which has been shot down, and another is said to have been damaged. The remaining six were driven back by the destroyers' anti-aircraft guns. However, the communiqué did not mention the date. (Reuters, 13th)

### Two British Merchant Ships Sunk by German Aircraft

Amsterdam - The British armed merchant ship "Thames" of 1,700 tons was sunk by German aircraft off the east coast of England. The crew has landed near a British port. The British government vessel "Crosston" sank off the east coast of England after hitting a mine. Nine crew members were rescued. The British armed merchant ship "Bitterness" of 932 tons was hit by a bomb from a German aircraft and caught fire. The crew jumped ship one after another to escape. (Haitong, 13th)

### Soviet Forces Concentrated in Salla Region, Preparing for Major Offensive, Apparently to Cut Off Finland's North-South Links, Air Force Continues Planned Bombing

Stockholm - Military observers who returned from the Finnish front believe that the Finnish army has the mentality of waiting for the enemy's large-scale offensive to fight to the death. Soviet forces seem to have concentrated 40,000 people in the Salla region, preparing for a major offensive. The target of the attack seems to be the Gulf of Bothnia, apparently with the intention of splitting Finland into two parts. Yesterday, about 100 Soviet bombers carried out planned bombing of Finland's railways, shipyards, and telephone communications. The Finnish long-wave radio station in Lahti was also bombed once. (Haitong, 13th)

Stockholm - According to news from the Finnish capital, the General Staff of the country issued a war report last night, stating that 40,000 Red Army soldiers are surrounded in the northern Salla region and are now attempting to break through to avoid being annihilated. The strategy adopted by the Finnish army is the same as that used in the battle of Suomussalmi. In other words, ski troops are used to penetrate deep into the Red Army's rear to cut off supply lines. The Soviet Murmansk railway line was therefore destroyed, and the Red Army had to use aircraft to transport supplies, and even reinforcements were transported by aircraft. In addition, according to Swedish newspapers, the Soviet radio station broadcast news that if the Finnish army did not surrender to the Soviet Union within 48 hours, German troops would take action against the country. (Havas, 13th)

The Hague - According to news from the Finnish capital, 30 Soviet aircraft flew to the country's industrial center of Abo today to drop bombs, causing many civilian casualties. (Havas, 12th)

Moscow - According to a communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, reconnaissance teams were still active in the Ukhtua and Repola areas on the 12th. At the same time, there were continued clashes between the two sides' infantry in the Petrozavodsk area. Artillery fire was not heavy in the Karelian Isthmus, but reconnaissance teams on both sides were quite active. The Soviet Air Force conducted reconnaissance flights. (TASS, 13th)

### United Kingdom Improves Air Defense Equipment Testing of Barrage Balloons Proves Effective

London - In order to improve air defenses, British military authorities previously tested barrage balloons over major cities and proved that they were effective. Therefore, a few weeks ago, they widely deployed this type of balloon along the coast, especially at the mouths of rivers, using long ropes tied to wooden boats and scattered along the coast. If German aircraft were to attack in the future and touch the rope tied to the balloon, an explosion would occur and they would crash. They would have to fly at high altitude, and therefore, they would not be able to arbitrarily bomb British river mouths or place magnetic mines on the sea surface along the coast. Thus, it can be seen that the effectiveness of barrage balloons is great and far beyond what most people imagine. (Havas, 13th)

### Polish Army Ready for Deployment in France Preparing to Go to the Front Line to Participate in Combat Only Reconnaissance Teams Active on Western Front

Paris - The Polish army has been reorganized in France. General Sikorski, Prime Minister and Minister of Military Affairs of the country, recently sent a telegram to General Gamelin, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces of the United Kingdom and France, saying, "Our army is now ready for deployment and will go to the front line to fight alongside the great Allied Forces of the United Kingdom and France. We firmly believe that we will be able to overcome any difficulties. From now on, our army will definitely achieve complete victory, and our country will be restored to freedom." (Havas, 12th)

Paris - The weather on the Western Front is still severely cold, and the fierce north wind is unbearable. Therefore, aerial activity on both sides is less than in previous days. However, reconnaissance aircraft, protected by fighter aircraft, repeatedly flew over the front line. In one encounter, a German reconnaissance aircraft was shot down about 20 miles behind the French lines. German aircraft made long-range reconnaissance flights, twice flying to the Air Force base in Elros in northeastern France for raids. The air pressure at the front line was quite low, so patrol activity was less. The German side only fired some artillery in the east and west of the Vosges, but the artillery fire was not heavy and there were no special targets. The French communiqué stated that there was local reconnaissance team activity on the front line yesterday. (Reuters, 13th)

### British Chancellor of the Exchequer Pleads with the Nation for Significant Sacrifices: Eliminate Waste, Promote Savings, Strictly Punish Speculation and Profiteering, and Prevent Inflation from Recurring Today

London – Members of the wartime cabinet are now successively giving speeches. The first was Prime Minister Chamberlain’s speech last Sunday, and the second was Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon’s speech today in Glasgow. He appealed to the people of the entire nation to quickly adopt emergency measures to prevent the recurrence of currency inflation and wild price drops that occurred after the last World War. Because there will be smarter actions this time, it is hoped that the impact of post-war price declines can be avoided, or that ways can be found to reduce it. We must not think that we can achieve the ultimate goal of the war without making significant sacrifices. Those who believe that victory can be achieved without the full contribution of the entire population hold a false and dangerous opinion. It is appropriate for us to truthfully tell them of the sacrifices they must endure. Once they thoroughly understand, they will willingly make all kinds of sacrifices. The Chancellor of the Exchequer continued, saying that the purpose of the budget he proposed in September was not only to raise the maximum possible funds to cover the first year of war expenses, but also to encourage the people of the country not to engage in unnecessary waste. As for those in all income brackets who pay income tax, they must temporarily make real reductions in their standard of living. The Chancellor of the Exchequer further warned the nation that, in addition to increasing taxes and promoting savings, other methods will be adopted to restrict consumption and raise funds for the war. Although this measure may seem overly strict and unpleasant, it is important to know that if the hidden dangers it prevents were to occur, the unpleasantness would inevitably be even greater. The outcome of this war will show whether the self-discipline of a free democratic life is inferior to the mechanized training of an omnipotent state, which is merely a tool. We now hold the world’s greatest goal, which is freedom. The entire nation is prepared to spare no necessary sacrifices and strive to move towards this goal. The Chancellor of the Exchequer also mentioned his previous appeal to small investors, which resulted in the acquisition of more than 50 million pounds in seven weeks. He was deeply moved by the various contributions made by the poorest people, disregarding their personal sacrifices. The Chancellor of the Exchequer also said that some people criticized the Prime Minister’s speech on Sunday, saying that the government had not fulfilled its responsibilities to prevent prices from rising. This criticism is unreasonable. The government has already purchased large quantities of all major food and raw materials at affordable prices, so that the price increase is reduced to a minimum. Various control measures have also prevented these items from falling into the hands of profiteers. At the same time, laws have been used to punish any behavior that exploits the public regarding retail prices. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### Belisha's Resignation: German Propaganda Not Worth a Laugh

London – German sources claim that Belisha’s resignation as Secretary of War was due to Prime Minister Chamberlain’s inspection tour of the British Expeditionary Force in France, where he felt that the British army’s equipment and discipline were inadequate, leading to dissatisfaction. The British War Office issued a statement today denying this claim, calling it a complete fabrication by German propagandists, not worth a laugh. It is noted that before the Prime Minister departed the war zone to return home, he published an article stating that he was deeply moved after reviewing the organization of the army and air force, as their progress was surprisingly rapid. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### Finnish Civilians Killed in Air Raids: 234 Dead, 480 Wounded

### Severe Cold Wave Sweeping Across Europe: Rivers Frozen, Navigation Blocked; Adriatic Coast Hit by Disasters

Paris – In recent days, the weather has been severely cold throughout Europe, especially in Central Europe. The people of Germany are suffering greatly due to the lack of coal. In the Netherlands, rivers in various places have frozen, as have flooded areas. Experts claim that this has no impact on national defense, because if anything happens in the country, this ice layer can be destroyed with artillery or explosives. It is inconvenient for land forces from other countries to attack on ice, and what’s more, it will soon snow. Marching in snow and ice will definitely be extremely difficult. In addition, the Danube River basin in Hungary has also frozen, and it is extremely cold throughout the country. The climate in Yugoslavia is bitterly cold, and railway traffic throughout the country has been blocked by wind and snow. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 12th)

### Norway's New Budget: Military Spending Increases Sharply, Accounting for 20% of the Total; Tax Increases to Make Up for Deficit

Oslo – When Norwegian Finance Minister Duurssen submitted the budget proposal for 1940 to Parliament, he proposed a tax increase bill. The trade tax was increased from 1% to 2%, and the 10% income tax that began to be levied last year was also doubled to compensate for the special military expenses to guarantee Norway's neutrality. The total amount of these military expenses is 150,000,000 kroner, accounting for about 20% of the total budget expenditure of 826,000,000 kroner. The deficit in the 1940 budget is about 84,000,000 kroner. In order to compensate for this year's deficit of 200,000,000 kroner, it is expected that the "special national defense tax" levied on income and capital will collect 80,000,000 kroner, and the remaining 120,000,000 kroner will be made up by issuing additional public bonds.

### Hu Shih Gives Speech in the United States on the Sino-Japanese War: China Will Continue to Fight and Obtain Honorary Position

Philadelphia, United States – Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Hu Shih, gave a speech last night at the annual meeting of the Association of American Universities, briefly stating that the current Sino-Japanese War is part of a new world war. This new world war began when Japan invaded the Northeast, and then spread to Abyssinia, Spain, and Czechoslovakia, until today’s European war and the Soviet-Finnish war. In these eight years, all conflicts have been the destruction of world peace and order by aggressors. China does not wish to follow in the footsteps of Abyssinia, Austria, or Albania, and will continue to fight for freedom and independence. The current situation in Europe is very similar to the situation in China, as both are resistance by democratic countries against aggressors. This similarity can enable people around the world to have a deeper understanding of China’s heroic resistance in the past thirty months, which is actually part of the current world war. It is difficult to predict the future development. (United Press dispatch, 13th)

Washington – The Chinese Embassy in the United States announced last night that Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Hu Shih, was appointed yesterday as the honorary president of the Union Specialized School in Schenectady, New York in 1940.

### Chinese Army in Northern Jiangsu Recovers Siyang: Japanese Army Suffers Heavy Losses, Remnants Flee Through the North Gate

Northern Jiangsu Dispatch: Siyang is a key town in northern Jiangsu. The Grand Canal is close to its east, and the Qingsu Highway runs through the county. Geographically, it has long been regarded as "Huaiyin's Strategic Position." In the spring of 1939, the Japanese army invaded south from Xuzhou. Although the defending troops made efforts to resist, they were eventually forced to abandon Siyang County on February 27th due to the fierce Japanese artillery fire. However, they continued to operate in the surrounding villages, attempting to attack the Japanese army. On December 2nd, the Chinese army decided to launch a general counter-offensive on the county with superior tactics, and formally recovered Siyang County. This battle is truly a glorious page in the history of the anti-Japanese war in northern Jiangsu. The details of the battle are described as follows:

State of War: The regular X Brigade and the county's regular regiment of the Chinese army repeatedly launched counter-attacks. The Japanese garrison stationed in the area felt greatly constrained and threatened. As a result, the garrison was frequently changed. After the arrival of the Chida Unit, the Chinese army intensified its counter-attacks, first cutting off all supplies to the Japanese army. As a result, the Japanese puppet troops went out to loot for their needs, but were intercepted by the Chinese army each time. The Japanese army gained nothing, but suffered considerable setbacks. Furthermore, they were unable to support Zhongxing and other areas, and had to prepare to concentrate their forces at one point to hold their ground, hoping to prolong their remaining life.

Chinese Army Deployment:

The Japanese forces entrenched in the city included the Chida Unit with over one hundred soldiers, and about seventy or eighty puppet self-defense troops commanded by the traitor Ge Xueqin. They lacked weapons and were composed of the old and weak. Their combat strength was weak and their fighting will was extremely lacking. The Chinese forces participating in the attack were the entire X Battalion of the county's regular force, one detachment of Fan's unit from the X District, over a hundred civilian rifles, and a part of Ma's battalion from the XX Regiment. They were all elite troops. In terms of deployment, the Chinese side seemed to have the upper hand.

Course of the Siege:

On December 30th, the Chinese army's siege units concentrated in the Likouzhen area. The district's regular detachment and the civilian rifles from Renhe, Likou, Longmen, Nanyuan and other towns were under the command of District Chief Fan, responsible for attacking the eastern gate front. The XX companies of the X Battalion were under the command of Company Commander Jiang, responsible for attacking the front east of the south gate. The X Company and two platoons of Ma's battalion from the XX Regiment were under the command of Platoon Leader Wang as a reserve force, positioned at Lizhuang on the Donghetan, monitoring the Japanese army in Zhongxing and preventing them from launching an attack. After the Chinese army's deployment was completed, they began to advance around one o'clock, occupying Xiaonan Street and engaging in fierce street fighting with the Japanese army. After an hour of stalemate, the Japanese army was unable to withstand the attack and retreated into the city, using light and heavy machine guns to strafe the Chinese army and firing over forty shells. The artillery fire was dense and there was no gap to take advantage of, so they were unable to break in in one go. After fighting fiercely until three o'clock, the Chinese army units withdrew to Longmenxi Township and Donghetan, preparing to launch another counter-attack. At around five o'clock in the afternoon, it was reported that the Japanese army in the city was transporting all the supplies to Zhongxing, and the Japanese army was providing strict protection. The Chinese army was greatly encouraged upon hearing the news, and continued to attack the county along the original front line, unstoppable. The streets outside the city were immediately occupied. The remaining Japanese puppet troops still resisted with all their strength, attempting to put up a last-ditch fight. However, the Chinese army soldiers charged forward, fighting bloody battles and occupying the eastern gate. At this time, twelve people from the puppet self-defense force, including Zhang Xiaopangzi, acted as insiders and took the opportunity to defect. The order in the city was in chaos. The Japanese puppet troops fled in panic through the north gate. The Chinese army sent troops to search in different directions and burned down the bunkers built by the Japanese army on the city wall. After the Japanese puppet troops retreated through the north gate, they used the river embankment and artillery to bombard the city. The Japanese army in Zhongxing also fired artillery in support. Fires broke out in several places in the city, and bullets fell like rain. It was difficult for the Chinese army units to hold on, so they withdrew to Nanyuan Township and Donghetan at dawn on the 2nd, and launched a flanking attack on the Japanese army with reinforcements. All the Japanese puppet troops fled to Zhongxing and refused to come out. As a result, Siyang County, which had been occupied for nearly ten months, was completely recovered by the Chinese army.

Glorious Victory:

In the battle of Siyang, although the Japanese army initially resisted and engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army, they suffered heavy casualties and consumed a great deal of force. In the end, they were forced to flee north by the fierce offensive of the Chinese army, in a state of utter disarray. After the Chinese army entered the city, the spoils of war seized included twelve wooden-handled hand grenades, seventy-four 7.9mm rifle bullets, three raincoats, four cotton coats, six water bottles, one cowhide backpack, and one saddle.

### Fierce Battle at Liuliyan, Haiyan County

Haiyan Dispatch: After Haiyan County was recovered by the Chinese side, the provincial government appointed the new County Magistrate Zhong Jiazhou to go to the city to comfort the wounded and the dead and handle the aftermath. The County Magistrate divided the county's original six districts into three districts: Tonggan, Yushan Shen, and County City. The district chiefs have also been appointed, and all administrative work is gradually on track. At the end of last year, the Japanese army in Ganpu mistakenly believed the false report of the puppet governor Wang that the Haiyan County Magistrate was often in Liuliyan, so they sent a shallow-water warship. When they arrived there, it was already midnight, and they were surrounded by the Chinese army's mobile unit. The two sides engaged in street fighting in the town. Most of the residents of the town were awakened from their sleep and fled in panic. Afterwards, most of the town's hundreds of shops were burned and turned to rubble.

### Active Chinese Army in Hangzhou

Hangzhou Dispatch: After the Chinese army on the south bank of the Qiantang River advanced to the north bank, fierce battles took place at Liuhe Pagoda and Gongbu. Recently, the Chinese army also broke into Qibao. The Japanese Ito unit was attacked and routed, suffering more than half casualties. Commander Lieutenant Suizu was seriously injured and died on the way. It is reported that the Chinese army is now distributed in the XXXXXXXXXX area, facing the Japanese army in Xinqiao and Gaoqiao. The Yama Ben unit, a powerful elite force of the Japanese army, has also been attacked by the Chinese army one after another. Small scattered teams of about thirty or forty people have been annihilated.

### Jiashan Station Attacked

Jiashan Dispatch: Over eight hundred newly arrived Chinese soldiers in the suburbs of Jiashan have successively drawn and trained the mobile units in the surrounding villages. At midnight on December 28th, the Chinese army took advantage of the Japanese railway garrison's unpreparedness and attacked Jiashan Station. The Japanese garrison was caught off guard and fled in panic. The Chinese army seized the opportunity to attack the east gate along the road. The Japanese army in the city, alerted, stubbornly resisted at the exit. The two sides fought fiercely until dawn, and the Chinese army retreated after reorganizing. The Japanese army suffered more than twenty casualties. Now, outside the isolated city, half of the grain and all agricultural products have been intercepted by the Chinese army and cannot be transported to the city. As a result, rice prices in the city have risen sharply. White rice costs twenty-five yuan per stone. Fuel, vegetables and daily necessities are all unusually expensive. In addition to the city and along the railway, there are gangs of bandits committing robbery cases almost every night. The occurrence of kidnapping cases near the city is almost daily. The farmers' plowing cattle in the surrounding villages have all been robbed and slaughtered, and spring plowing will inevitably become a problem.

### Student Relief Association Continues to Assist Impoverished Students with Expenses; Registration Starts on January 22nd

The Student Relief Association, organized by the Chinese YMCA and YWCA of this city, previously provided financial assistance to students from impoverished families in this city in order to encourage young people to study hard, and achieved remarkable results. Now that the schools are about to end the semester and the next semester is about to begin, the association will continue to provide financial assistance to outstanding students from impoverished families. It has been decided that registration will be handled from January 20th to 28th at the YWCA, No. 999 Jing'an Temple Road. Admission tickets will be collected on February 5th, the examination date is February 7th, results will be announced on the 14th, oral examinations will be held on the 16th, and funds can be collected on the 19th.

After the review work is completed, they can receive the admission ticket and take the examination as scheduled. The examination subjects are the same as last semester, only the general knowledge test. The subsidy is about 30 to 50 yuan per student, with a quota of 200 students.

### General Situation of Promoting Compulsory Education in China (7)

Promoting compulsory education and raising funds are closely related. According to the provisions of the original outline of measures and implementing rules, the principle of compulsory education funding is that the local government bears the burden, but the central government may subsidize remote and impoverished provinces and other provinces and cities with special circumstances. Therefore, the methods of raising compulsory education funds have long been clearly stipulated. The amount of central government subsidies was originally planned to be increased year by year, with the first year being 2.4 million yuan, the second year being 4.8 million yuan, the third year being 7.2 million yuan, the fourth year being 9.6 million yuan, and the fifth year being 12 million yuan. However, in fact, due to the impact of the war, the amount in the 28th year was only 4.3 million yuan, which is quite different from the original plan. As for the amount raised by various provinces, counties, and cities, although it exceeded three times the amount raised by the central government in the first two years, it has decreased greatly since the third year. Even if it could be raised according to the proportion of the first two years, it would still be far from sufficient. Therefore, if compulsory education is to be promoted in the future, it will be difficult to talk about universal education unless there are practical, reliable, and easy-to-promote specific measures for local fundraising.

D. In terms of the implementation plan, according to the outline of measures and implementing rules for implementing compulsory education, at least 80% of the total number of school-age children nationwide should be enrolled from August 1935 to July 1940. At that time, this plan was calculated based on a national population of 450 million. If school-age children accounted for one-tenth of the population, then there should be 45 million school-age children nationwide. According to the statistics in 1934, there were already 13,128,635 children enrolled nationwide, accounting for more than 29% of the total number of school-age children. If the number of enrolled children increased by 4.4 million each year, then 22 million children could be enrolled within five years. Adding the original number of more than 13 million enrolled children, the total number could reach more than 35 million, accounting for more than 80% of all school-age children. However, since the implementation, in the first year (i.e., 1935), according to the reports from various provinces, the total number of newly enrolled children was 3,838,930. In the second year (i.e., 1936), the total number of newly enrolled children was 4,409,729, which is still far from the original planned number. Furthermore, judging from the national primary education statistics report, the number of enrolled children in 1935 was 15,559,848, accounting for more than 35% of the total number. The number of enrolled children in 1936 was 18,285,129, accounting for more than 41% of the total number. The number of enrolled children in 1937 was 19,416,978, accounting for more than 44% of the total number. According to this calculation, if the goal is to reach more than 80%, then the number of enrolled children is still more than 15 million short. Although this plan has only been implemented for three years, and it has been affected by the War of Resistance midway, it is easy to achieve the predetermined standard, but the results of the first two years of implementation were also not in line with the original plan. Therefore, regardless of the provinces in the rear or the provinces and cities throughout the country after the end of the war, if the goal is to reach this predetermined standard, it is still necessary to make redoubled efforts and find ways to carry it out in order to complete this fundamental task of universalizing national education.

### Preliminary Cup: Joyful and Sundan Secure Final Spots, Achieving Chinese Supremacy

In this year's Preliminary Cup Football Championship, contested by thirteen Chinese and Western teams, the semi-final week concluded yesterday with two matches. The Chinese teams reported frequent victories. Joyful defeated the Army Medical Team by a large margin of five to one, with Joyful leading by two goals in the first half and the Army Medical Team scoring none. In the other match, Sundan soundly defeated Hacoah by six to two, with Sundan also taking the lead in the first half by four to one. Both matches resulted in lopsided scores, demonstrating the strength of the Chinese teams. Now that Joyful and Sundan have both secured their spots in the final, the Silver Cup, held by Lidu last year, will remain in Chinese hands. The details of the two matches are as follows:

Joyful Club Overwhelms Army Medical Team

The match between Joyful Club and the Army Medical Team took place at 2:00 PM at Aurora University, with Wu Shouheng as the referee. Joyful had previously won the cup in 1932-1934 and 1935-1936. This year, they revitalized their efforts, determined to win. The Army Medical Team, on the other hand, had mediocre skills and lacked fighting spirit. Therefore, the outcome was clear from the start. Joyful's Ge Xizuo scored the first goal with his initial attempt. Yuan Kun's and Tian Fu's inspiration also led to accomplishments. In the first half, Joyful scored two goals, while the Army Medical Team remained scoreless. In the second half, the Army Medical Team showed no improvement, while Joyful became even more active. Cao Qinfang first registered a goal, and Mao Hongfa then scored from a penalty kick. Soon after, Hongfa scored again, completing a five-to-zero victory. In the end, the Army Medical Team launched a desperate attack, earning a free kick opportunity. Left-wing Lu Yiqi took the shot, aiming directly at the goal and successfully netting the ball. Time ran out, and Joyful eliminated the Army Medical Team by a score of five to one.

Joyful Club: Wang Cai, Gao Chen, Xiaoping Wang, Zhangbao Zhou, Qilin Hu, Youcheng Han, Longhai Ge, Xizuo Yuan, Kun Tian, Sun Hupei, Cao Qinfang, Mao Hongfa

Army Medical Team: Wilkes, Ieremoth, Herzog, Bowden, Sha, Heng, Rossel, Collins, Chequemen, Lu Yiqi, Polenberg, Gan, Walter, Dun

Sundan Team Thrashes Hacoah

The match between Sundan and Hacoah took place at 2:30 PM at Jiaozhou Park, with Lu Shunde as the referee. After being demoted from Group A to Group C this year, Sundan's performance has been excellent. Hacoah had previously lost to Mengcheng by zero to three in the league. Therefore, Sundan did not consider them a threat. After the game began, Sundan launched an immediate attack. Hacoah's goalkeeper became the target of the onslaught. Wang Xingen repeatedly reported good news, and Xu Kehong also scored twice, with two goals. Within ten minutes, Sundan scored four goals in a row, demonstrating astonishing speed. At thirty minutes, Yang Lianjun handled the ball in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick. Hacoah's center-back, Remydi, took the kick and scored a goal. At the end of the first half, Sundan led by four to one. As the second half began, Sundan, confident in their victory, responded calmly. Gu Xingxiang rose from the middle, firing a shot into the net. Hacoah's left-wing, Braca, secretly advanced, scoring a goal, equaling the scores for both sides. As the final five minutes approached, Xu Kehong, single-handedly, scored another goal. The game ended with Sundan thrashing Hacoah by a score of six to two.

### Ministry of Finance Notifies Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: Issuance of New Subsidiary Coins – Maintain Circulation, Prevent Illegal Profits – Adjust Fineness and Weight to Facilitate Circulation

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified the various trade associations, stating: "To Whom It May Concern, on the 12th of this month, we received a 30th-year directive No. 21371 from the Ministry of Finance stating that subsidiary coins are essential as a medium for small transactions, and the public demand is high. In recent years, the prices of major raw materials for coinage have been rising steadily. With the resurgence of the European war, the market prices of metals have increased even further, leading to a situation where the actual value of subsidiary coins has exceeded their legal value by a factor of one. The trend of hoarding and melting for profit cannot be suppressed, and there is even smuggling to supply Japan. In order to maintain the circulation of subsidiary coins and prevent unscrupulous individuals from seeking illegal profits, it is necessary to revise the subsidiary coin regulations and adjust the fineness and weight of various subsidiary coins to facilitate circulation.

Minting Two-Cent Coins

A plan has been drafted to revise the fineness and weight of one-cent, five-cent, and ten-cent subsidiary coins, and to add a two-cent subsidiary coin. This plan was submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting and then forwarded to the Supreme National Defense Council for deliberation and resolution: 'Passed to the Legislative Yuan for review.' The Ministry has been informed. As the revised subsidiary coin regulations have been approved by the Supreme National Defense Council, the principle has already been decided, and minting and issuing should be expedited to facilitate turnover. In addition to ordering the Central Mint to start minting immediately and scheduling the issuance for New Year's Day of the 29th year, and submitting a report to the Executive Yuan for record, and separately implementing it, we are sending you the articles 1, 3, and 5 of the revised subsidiary coin regulations and request that you inform all associations, merchants, and the public. Attached is a copy of the revised articles of the subsidiary coin regulations."

Fineness of New Coins

Article 2: The types of subsidiary coins are as follows: (1) Ten-cent subsidiary coin: total weight 3 grams, fineness: nickel 18, copper 55, zinc 27. (2) Five-cent subsidiary coin: total weight 2 grams, fineness: nickel 18, copper 55, zinc 27. (3) Two-cent subsidiary coin: total weight 2 grams, fineness: copper 65, zinc 35. (4) One-cent subsidiary coin: total weight 1.5 grams, fineness: copper 65, zinc 35. Article 3: Subsidiary coins are calculated in the decimal system. The number of coins equivalent to one legal yuan is as follows: (1) Ten ten-cent subsidiary coins. (2) Twenty five-cent subsidiary coins. (3) Fifty two-cent subsidiary coins. (4) One hundred one-cent subsidiary coins.

Number of Transactions

Article 5: The number of subsidiary coins accepted in transactions is limited to 20 legal yuan for ten-cent and five-cent subsidiary coins per transaction, and 5 legal yuan for two-cent and one-cent subsidiary coins per transaction. However, the collection of taxes and the exchange by the Central Bank are not subject to this restriction. Furthermore, according to inquiries from the New Voice News reporters to the banking sector, after receiving the Ministry's order, the Central Mint has started minting new subsidiary coins of one-cent, two-cent, five-cent, and ten-cent denominations with new fineness and weight, and has stopped minting old subsidiary coins of half-cent and twenty-cent denominations. The issuance of new subsidiary coins will be handled exclusively by the Central Bank. The old copper coins of half-cent and one-cent denominations, and the old nickel coins of ten-cent and twenty-cent denominations, which have been minted, issued, and circulated in the market, will continue to be valid."

### Western Constable Krangler in Good Condition

According to news received last night, Western Constable Krangler's condition has improved, and he received a blood transfusion from the hospital on the evening of the 12th.

### U.S. Ambassador Johnson Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai from Peiping on the 17th for a Two-Week Stay

U.S. Ambassador to China, Dr. Johnson, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the evening of November 20th last year and then transferred back. In addition to celebrating his daughter, Linni's, fourth birthday in Peiping, he also visited Tianjin once. The ambassador's life in Peiping is leisurely. It was widely rumored in Shanghai that the ambassador would come to Shanghai in the New Year, but it was delayed. According to news from the U.S. Embassy, the ambassador will indeed arrive in Shanghai on the 17th of this month aboard the U.S. transport ship Henderson (which was originally scheduled to arrive on the 18th), moving the scheduled itinerary forward by one day. While in Shanghai, the ambassador will meet with Consul General Gauss, who is about to take up his new post in Australia, to discuss recent developments. He will stay in Shanghai for about two weeks, and then leave Shanghai for Hong Kong and fly to Chongqing. According to news from the U.S. Embassy, after arriving in Shanghai, the ambassador may still take the Henderson, which is sailing to Hong Kong at the end of the month, although this has not been decided. The embassy has already made arrangements at the Hua Lian Hotel for the ambassador to stay.

The Continental Daily reports that, according to news from the U.S. Consulate, U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson will travel from Beiping to Qinhuangdao and take the U.S. transport ship Henderson south, arriving in Shanghai on the 17th of this month for a stay of about two weeks, and then leave Shanghai via Xianggang to Chongqing.

### Japanese Embassy Spokesman Denies Ultimatum to France: Tokyo Cable Reports Ultimatum to French Authorities Demanding Suspension of Arms Transport Within Two Weeks

The Japanese government has reportedly issued an ultimatum to the French government, demanding that it stop the transport of arms on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway within two weeks. According to reports, if the French side does not stop the transport of arms to Chongqing on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, Japanese aircraft will bomb every bridge on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway from Kunming to the Yunnan-Vietnam border. This news has been reported by Tokyo telegrams. However, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai denied the Japanese ultimatum to France. According to the spokesman, the Japanese side is considering the protest note sent by the French side to the Japanese government on January 5th. When answering this question, the spokesman said that the goal of the Japanese bombing of the railway is to prevent the transportation of wartime supplies.

### Japanese Officer Visits U.S. Consul General to Discuss Assault on American Woman Case

The Continental Daily reports that Mrs. Donaldson, an American citizen, was allegedly assaulted by a Japanese sentry on the North Sichuan Road Bridge on December 20th of last year. A Japanese naval spokesman said last night, "The allegations made by Mrs. Donaldson are completely untrue." However, according to a U.S. consul who spoke to a reporter last night, the U.S. Consul General does not agree with the Japanese spokesman's statement that no assault occurred. Yesterday afternoon, a Japanese naval officer visited U.S. Consul General Gauss to continue discussing the matter, and Mrs. Donaldson was also present.

### Six Arrested Chinese Not Yet Released: No One in Contact with British Army

The North China Daily News reports that the Central Army stationed in Shanghai arrested six Chinese men on the 4th of last month, four of whom were carrying weapons. They have been detained for more than five weeks. According to investigations and interrogations, four of them belong to the Caohejing "Police Bureau." The British Army has allowed them to communicate with the responsible party, and the six men have repeatedly requested rescue, but no action has been taken. To date, no one has gone to the Central Army headquarters to discuss their release.

### Shanghai Vegetable Supply to be Controlled: Rumor of Provisional Central Market Being Established

In an attempt to control the vegetable and local produce business, the Japanese have occupied the site of the former Four Banks Warehouse on the north bank of Suzhou Creek to establish a puppet "Central Market." It is understood that the renovation of the buildings has been completed, and the "opening" will be announced tomorrow. All inland cargo ships arriving in Shanghai will be notified that they must move to the "market" for trading. Four batches of glass sheds have been built behind the Four Banks Warehouse. According to inquiries made by a Da Guang News reporter, with the exception of a portion of the outer perimeter that has not yet been completed, the remaining work has been finished, and the "opening" will be announced tomorrow. It is reported that most of the various vegetables and local produce in the city, with the exception of a portion brought in by farmers from Pudong and western Shanghai, come from Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places, and are transported to Shanghai by inland cargo ships. In the past, they were mostly concentrated at the Old Gate Bridge and the Toutaba Wharf, where traders conducted business. Now, in order to implement control, the Japanese have established a "Central Market" and notified all cargo ships that they must move to the "market" for trading starting on the 15th. This move is clearly intended to impose exorbitant taxes and commissions, which will not only completely exploit the interests of the industry, but also affect vegetable prices in Shanghai. Therefore, all members of the industry have decided to refuse to cooperate. It is also reported that the Japanese plan to control the production of chicken and duck eggs in Pudong and organize a Chinese-foreign company, with purchasing agencies in Gaomiao, Gaoqiao, Yangjing, Dongchang Road, Tangqiao, and other places. All egg vendors passing through these areas will be subject to "official purchases." To prevent eggs from being hidden, inspections will be conducted at all ferry crossings.

### Promoting the Petroleum Industry

The China Petroleum Industry Promotion Association held a founders' meeting at the Bank of Communications building yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM. It was decided that the formal establishment meeting would be held after the Lunar New Year to step up the promotion of association affairs. It is understood that the association's work plan focuses first on research and exploration, recruiting petroleum technical personnel, and investigating the location of domestically produced oil. The second step will be to submit a request to the government to raise funds to engage in exploration and support industrial construction to benefit the people's livelihood.

### Cili Association Starts Relieving Hidden Poverty: Rice Tickets Distributed Starting from 15th, Cotton Clothing and Pants Available for Collection

The Shanghai Charity Federation, in view of the current high cost of rice in Shanghai, and the difficulty of life for middle and lower class families due to the large number of family members, is determined to provide relief to these hidden poor from the 15th of this month. The reason is to protect their dignity, they would rather pawn their belongings and borrow money than beg, their mental state is more distressed than the truly impoverished.

Many Who Report Directly or Indirectly

According to a Datong News reporter, the relief methods also start from secrecy. The hidden poor can report through relatives, or report to the association anonymously. After receiving the above reports, the association will conduct secret investigations to determine the degree of difficulty in their family life, and then determine the relief standard. In recent days, many hidden poor have reported to the association directly or indirectly.

Relief Method: Distribute Rice Tickets

The association has decided to secretly provide them with rice tickets starting from the 15th of this month. Each rice ticket can be used to claim two Sheng (a unit of dry measure) of rice from the association's special relief center. The association purchased 300 bags of Wuhu Xian rice yesterday morning, each bag containing 1.25 市斗 (Shi Dou, a unit of dry measure). After this batch of Xian rice is distributed, the association will continue to purchase more until the end of the old lunar year.

Cotton Clothing and Flannel Pants, Come to Collect

In addition, 5,000 sets of cotton wool cloth clothing and pants are prepared for the needs of the hidden poor. In addition to sending staff to secretly distribute them to the hidden poor, they can also come to the association to collect clothing for warmth. It is said that the above relief is the most practical need, but the association's funding is insufficient, and it hopes that charitable people in society will continue to donate funds for relief.

### Far East Bound French Ships Ordered to Add Armed Equipment: Mail Ships Above 5,000 Tons Equipped with Two Cannons, Do Not Fly Flags En Route

Since the outbreak of the European War, British ships have been equipped with armed equipment to avoid attacks by belligerent countries. It is now learned that French mail ships sailing in the Far East have also been ordered by the French government to add armed equipment to protect the safety of navigation. The level of equipment depends on the size of the tonnage and the needs of the sailing location. It is reported that mail ships with a load capacity of more than 5,000 tons have been equipped with a cannon position at the bow and stern for protection. At the same time, all glass windows on the ship are painted blue, and no flags are flown en route. Only when the ship arrives at the dock will the national flag be hung at the bow, so it is not easy to identify the nationality of the ship en route.

### 工部局一九三九年　重要行政概述（續）

The Shanghai Municipal Council's 1939 Important Administrative Overview (Continued)

Bund Wharf Usage Time

The measures for using the Bund wharves, which were established the year before last, continued to be implemented last year. The wharves in the Hongkou and Yangshupu districts have not yet been opened. However, the Bund wharves have been used by the shipping industry as much as possible, adding an item of income to the Council. Some residents near the Bund were disturbed by the loud noises of loading and unloading cargo at night and requested a ban. The Council then decided that, starting from January 1, 1940, loading and unloading of cargo would not be allowed from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning, except with special permission.

Holding a Safety First Campaign

To promote public awareness of road safety, the Police Department of the Council held a "Safety First" campaign publicity week from June 18th to 24th last year. A special committee was organized beforehand to formulate detailed publicity outlines, including advertisements, movies, written publicity, and the posting of leaflets and banners, etc. Public utility companies and transportation companies, owners of private and rented cars, bicycle shops, and rickshaw shops all participated in cooperation. During the week of the publicity campaign, traffic accidents decreased by 22% compared to the previous week, and the June accident record was also significantly lower than in other months of the year.

Postponement of Pharmacy Grading

The Council had thoroughly discussed the plan to implement control over various medicines, poisons, and the issuance of pharmacy licenses. Although this plan had been considered before, it was not put into practice. The result of this renewed discussion was that the issuance of licenses was still considered obstructive at present. The reasons are that the political situation in this port is complex, and the Council does not have the huge funds to implement any appropriate control measures regarding the above plan. Representatives of Chinese pharmacies and Chinese pharmaceutical factories in this port have put forward many opinions, all of which believe that the pharmacy business has complied with Chinese laws and all regulations promulgated by the Chinese government and should be subject to the jurisdiction of Chinese courts. If the Council adds control, it is superfluous. As for the Council's opinion, it is considered that the implementation of this plan involves the entire city and cannot be done without the cooperation of all relevant administrative authorities. At present, this port and its suburbs are in a state of emergency, and cooperation is difficult to achieve. Then the control plan will inevitably fail. Based on various reasons, the above-mentioned control point has been decided to be postponed temporarily. It will be reconsidered when the environment in this port returns to normal.

Increased Tuition Fees in Council Schools

Last year, the expenses required for establishing various schools by the Council increased significantly. The budget for Western children's schools and Chinese children's schools in 1940 increased by 43.7% and 38.5% respectively compared to 1938. In view of this, the Council decided in October to levy additional fees to make up for the deficit. The method is that Western children's schools will increase tuition fees by 25% starting from November 1st last year, and Chinese children's schools will increase tuition fees by 15% starting from the spring of this year. This additional fee can collect approximately 100,000 yuan per year.

Revised Prices for Park Tickets

Last year, the number of visitors to Jessfield Park increased sharply, and various facilities in the park were often damaged. Valuable plants were often stolen. Therefore, the Council decided to revise the prices of park tickets starting from June 1st last year as follows: (1) General annual tickets for all parks are 3 yuan per year; (2) General annual tickets for all parks except Jessfield Park are 1 yuan per year. The temporary tickets are still sold at 10 cents each. At the same time, the Council tried to persuade visitors to respect public morals in order to maintain the appearance. On the one hand, it discussed with the public bus company to add new routes to attract tourists to Jiaozhou Park.

Homing Merchant Association Investigates Rent

Between July and August last year, the national currency depreciated, and landlords increased rents one after another or requested payment in gold coins, which caused disputes. The Council had no right to interfere with the management or restriction of rent increases. The Homing Merchant Association then organized a Rent Adjustment Committee. Regarding rent disputes, applications can be made to the committee for arbitration.

Industrial Section Statistics on Living Expenses

Starting last year, the Industrial Section of the Council began to cooperate with the "Chinese Statistical Society" to collect statistical materials on the living expenses, wages, and working hours of Chinese people, which are published in the gazette every month for reference by the industrial and commercial sectors. The results are good. In addition, the Council also held statistics on the living expenses of foreigners.

Mediation of Disputes and Protection of Children

The Industrial Section spares no effort in mediating labor-management disputes within the district, hoping that strikes can be resolved as soon as possible to avoid losses for both labor and management. In December of the year before last, the Council decided to add a small-scale "Child Protection Section" to supervise maids who are employed and separated from the care of close relatives as one of its functions. However, there are countless children and youths in society who are bound and trampled by others, such as child beggars led by female beggar leaders, apprentices completely bound by employers, female workers controlled by foremen, and young girls who have entered brothels. The section pays attention to them at any time based on reports from various sources. (To be continued)

### Prohibition of Shipping Shanghai Factory Products: Concerns of Manufacturers; Municipal Chamber of Commerce Has Telegraphed the Ministry for Instructions

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received an order from the Ministry of Economic Affairs to prepare a unified form for the list of certificates of domestic goods, which was immediately complied with and reported. It has now been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs again yesterday, saying, "Respectfully to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, received and understood the Gongzi No. 40813 telegraph. Will follow the style and print, and supervise the person in charge to handle it carefully. The purpose of this certificate is mainly for industrial products in the two special districts. Recently, according to reports here, starting this year, finished products made by domestic factories in the Shanghai Concession are generally prohibited from being transported to the mainland. Telegrams have been sent to the governors of various provinces and customs, etc. Compared with the two, it may be a rumor, but the merchants and factories are already panicked and have elected representatives to petition. Please report it first. If it is not true, please announce it quickly. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wen."

### Peien Apartments Sold to Chinese for 2.5 Million

Peien Apartments (Bearn Apartment) near Avenue Joffre and Rue Lupan were originally owned by foreigners. According to news the night before last, the apartments have been sold to a Chinese person surnamed in Hong Kong for a price of 2.5 million. It is said that the transaction was completed ten days ago. Who the winner is remains a secret.

### Mail Ship Schedule: Athos Returns to France Today, Empress of Asia Comes to Shanghai from Hong Kong

### A Record of Wang Jiyuan's Painting Exhibition

— Ze

Among Shanghai painters, those who work the hardest are unanimously recommended as Mr. Wang Jiyuan. Those who travel to famous mountains and rivers all over the world most diligently are also unanimously recommended as Mr. Wang Jiyuan. After the war started, among the painters overseas, the one who held the most exhibitions for disaster relief and donated the most money is also known as Mr. Wang Jiyuan.

Because Mr. Wang is diligent and has traveled widely, his works have an imposing spirit. The viewers are dazzled and admire them endlessly. However, people in Shanghai have not been able to see his works for more than two years. Now Mr. Wang, at the request of his friends, is exhibiting his works at the Great World Department Store, which has already opened yesterday, greatly satisfying the longing of the people of Shanghai.

Because of the differences between Chinese and Western painting in terms of external form, some people suppress Western painting and promote Chinese painting, or suppress Chinese painting and promote Western painting. Some even take the dregs of Chinese and Western painting and create the so-called eclectic school. In fact, painting, whether Chinese or Western, does not differ in its essence. Chinese painting emphasizes lines, while Western painting emphasizes colors. Because of the emphasis on lines, perspective and shading are relatively neglected. The lines of Western painting are hidden within the colors. The difference between Chinese and Western painting is only the different techniques and tools used. Mr. Wang is proficient in both Chinese and Western painting and can deeply study the principles of painting. Therefore, he does not make superficial remarks about Chinese and Western painting but devotes himself to his works. Chinese painting has its own characteristics, and Western painting has its own characteristics. In this exhibition, Mr. Wang juxtaposes his Chinese and Western paintings, allowing people to see his profound attainments in both Chinese and Western painting. It also shows that the essence of Chinese and Western painting is not unique.

In the past two years, Mr. Wang has devoted himself to painting bamboo. The different states of sunshine, rain, dew, wind, and snow all have different postures, but their elegance is the same. Painting bamboo to this extent can be called a success. Mr. Wang has also completed the first collection of "Jiyuan's Bamboo Paintings," which is widely circulated in Nanyang. Those who attend this exhibition should not neglect the bamboo painted by Mr. Wang.

Why does Mr. Wang not paint willows that fall with the wind but only paints bamboo? It is because he takes the firmness and unyieldingness of bamboo as a symbol of the loyalty of a gentleman. Looking at his inscriptions, most of them express this meaning, and the hard work of Mr. Wang can also be known from this.

In the Soviet Union's Chinese painting exhibition, Mr. Wang's work was a pine tree center hall, which was greatly appreciated by the people of that country. The inscription said: "When the strong wind rises, only the pine stands alone, towering into the sky, shaking in all directions. In the cold winter, it is delicate, long-lived, and healthy, friendly and neighboring, the light of friendship between countries." This is attached to Mr. Wang's painting exhibition.

### The Mahler Ship Sinks a Coal Boat; Coal Pounds Fall into the River, Barge Returns to Stability

The North China Daily News said that the Elsie Mahler yacht of the Mahler Company, when sailing into the middle of the Huangpu River from the Bund of the French Concession on Thursday afternoon, a barge full of coal pounds was traveling downstream and failed to avoid it, causing it to hit the propeller of the Mahler ship. The barge was small and immediately capsized. Coal pounds and boatmen fell into the river. After the coal pounds fell into the river, the barge returned to stability. The boatmen also climbed back onto the boat in the water. A dredging boat arrived a few hours later to remove the coal pounds from the bottom of the river.

### Silver Shops Fail to Hand in Gold: Hindrance to National Policy; Shanghai Silver Shop Business Runs Counter to Pre-War

The Shanghai silver shop industry has seen a boom after the war due to the sharp increase in population and the abnormal development of the market. This is because people seeking refuge are forced to sell gold and silver ornaments to make a living. After the foreign exchange control, the wealthy have anxieties and have purchased and stored gold. Therefore, the incoming and outgoing transactions are more prosperous than in the past. As a result, newly established silver shops or gold and silver stores with similar properties are like bamboo shoots after spring rain. However, their business is completely contrary to that before the war. Before the war, it was mainly to supply ornaments, such as manufacturing locks, bracelets, rings, hairpins, and other decorative items. Now, it is mostly active in the gold market. Because gold prices are rising and dark markets are fluctuating, huge profits can be obtained at any time. Moreover, due to the high gold prices, gold hidden by the people in the mainland is also being brought to Shanghai for sale one after another. This is another reason for the prosperity of the business. According to the order of national gold ownership, the gold stored in silver shops should be handed over to the government in full. However, due to the special environment in Shanghai, the silver shop industry has not yet complied with the order, which is contrary to the national economic policy. It is heard that all relevant parties in this city are studying methods to maintain the national policy.

### US Ship Marblehead Returned to Shanghai Yesterday; Two Gunboats Sailed to Hankou

The Guam will arrive in Shanghai on February 6.

### Japanese Ships Prowling Outside Wenzhou Port: Yonghua Wheel Blocked

After the successful trial voyages of foreign merchant ships navigating between Shanghai and Wenzhou, shipping has been frequent in the past week, so freight transportation has gradually become smoother. According to industry news yesterday, Japanese ships still prowl outside the mouth of the Ou River from time to time. Recently, the British Yonghua and Yongfeng wheels sailing to Wenzhou were inspected by Japanese ships after arriving outside the mouth of Wenzhou. After the Yonghua wheel was inspected by the Japanese ships, the Japanese side prevented it from importing. It is heard that as of yesterday, it had not yet been imported. The Yongfeng wheel has arrived in Wenzhou. The British ship New Annet arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The ship is scheduled to continue loading cargo in Shanghai and sail to Wenzhou on the 15th.

### Tang Ship Fails to Export

The Tang Lu, Tang Sai, Tang Qiao, and Tang Bei wheels, which were represented by the American-owned China-American Shipping Corporation in this city, have been illegally occupied by the Japanese. The Tang Bei wheel (renamed the Fourth Far East) has been sailing to Dinghai. The Tang Sai wheel (renamed the Second Far East) was originally scheduled to sail for the first time to the ports on the Xiaochang River line yesterday. It has been found out that the Tang Sai wheel was suddenly blocked by the Japanese side yesterday, so it failed to leave. It is related to the fact that the rent has not been paid, so it must be postponed to today or tomorrow. In addition, the Tang Lu wheel (renamed the First Far East) was opened to ports by the Japanese side on the 7th and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. There is also Tang Qiao (renamed the Third Far East), which also set off yesterday morning, but returned to port again in the afternoon. The truth is unknown.

### Failure to Extort Usual Fees: Conspiracy to Kill a Korean Woman Selling Drugs; Helping Gangs Commit Murder During Layoffs; Two Criminals Are on the Run, Three Criminals Are Arrested Awaiting Investigation

A Korean woman named Luo Quexin, 45 years old, who lived at No. 43 Laoshifu Road in the French Concession, was broken into and searched by thieves on the afternoon of November 27 last year, causing her to be strangled to death. The thieves carried the loot and fled. After the case occurred, the corpse was reported to the French Police Department. Until recently, the investigation led to the capture of four thieves, Gao Changfu, Shen Bingrong, Li San, and the suspected woman Ma Guo, all from Jiangbei, and it was found that there were two accomplices, Shao Changrong, who were on the run. The police department sent the captured criminals to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention for further investigation. It is now heard that in the investigation, all learned that the deceased was

Selling drugs

Morphine, and Gao Changfu was helping at her home. After being laid off, on the day of the incident, Gao gathered the captured Shen and Li and the escaped Shao and Cai to Luo Quexin's home, demanding usual fees but failing. They immediately decided to bind Luo's hands and feet and stuff cotton into her mouth. They began to search and obtained cash, gold watches, and other ornaments worth about 200 yuan. Gao then thought that he knew the woman. To silence her, he strangled Luo to death in order to destroy the traces. Yesterday morning, the Second Special Court continued to try the case in the first criminal division of Judge Fan. The police department's lawyer, Chen Ming, stated the case and filed a public prosecution based on the charges of

Robbery and Murder.

Ma Guo was found to have no relationship to the case and was not prosecuted. The plaintiff, Luo Shunde, the son of the deceased, arrived in court to state how his mother was killed and discovered. When asked, Ma Changfu confessed that he only led Shen and others there and waited outside, and did not enter to participate in the theft or murder. Shen and Li also confessed that although they went together, it was Shao Changrong who was on the run who bound the deceased's hands and feet, and Cai Er stuffed cotton into her mouth, etc. After verifying the confession in court, the hearing was adjourned to the 27th for further questioning. The three defendants, Ma, Shen, and Li, were remanded in custody. Ma Guo was not prosecuted by the police department and should be released.

### Shanghai Long Sunny Days Get Rain; Observatory Records 3.9 mm of Rain; Extremely Bad Weather Due to Persistent Low Pressure

This port has been cloudy since yesterday due to the influence of a forming low pressure over the Yangtze River Basin. It started to rain last night. Although it did not last long, it stopped soon. It is of great benefit during this long drought and dry season. According to the records of the Xujiahui Observatory, the rainfall time yesterday was between 8:00 and 11:00, and the rainfall was 2.9 cm. It was found that this port last rained on November 26 last year, and the weather has been sunny ever since. It has been more than forty days since it was moistened by rainwater. However, due to the low pressure, the temperature is quite high, as if in the spring. Recently, the climate can tend to be cold and snowy.

### Impersonating Government Officials to Intimidate and Deceive; Three Criminals Each Sentenced to Six Months of Imprisonment as a Warning

Sheng Jinqing, the owner of the Shengfaxing Cotton Cloth Store at No. 462 Beijing Road, is from this county. Because he was infatuated with Tang Ying, a dancer in the Paramount Ballroom, he

Impersonated Zhang Fengyi, a staff member of the "Shanghai Municipal Government Land Bureau," and colluded with Che Xin Dingsheng and Ji Duan Sheng to abandon Tang Ying after messing with her. Using intimidation, they attempted to extort 20,000 yuan from Sheng. At noon on the 24th of last month, at the Daxin Restaurant on Rue de Consulat, they beat Yu and his wife Ren severely and threatened to go to the headquarters of a certain commander. After the detectives arrived, they arrested Zhang Xin Xu for three years. The police department's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, prosecuted them for attempted extortion and fraud. The trial has been concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened the first criminal division and sentenced Zhang, Xin, and Xu to six months of imprisonment each for jointly intimidating and attempting to defraud as a warning. Xu's lawyer Shen Xingyi, Xin's lawyer Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, and Zhang Fukang requested bail. The court ruled after hearing the arguments that it would be reviewed again.

### Driver Causes Accident: Rickshaw Driver Punished; Principal Compensates for Losses

Wu Dongchu, the owner of the Guanghua Clothing Factory at No. 233 Nanjing Road, is from Suzhou. At 1:10 PM on the 5th of this month, a private car No. 2250 driven by Xu Fenghao from Tongzhou was traveling east on Huade Road in Yangshupu and went the wrong way, knocking Jiang Xiaodi (17 years old), a fellow from Tongzhou who was working at the Dakang Food Company, off his delivery bicycle, injuring his head and cracking his skull. He died shortly after. Detective Ji Peijin and West Constable Walker arrived at the scene after hearing the alarm and took the car driver Xu Fenghao to the Lishan Police Station for detention. The next morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court to apply for arrest. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng examined the case in the third criminal division of the Fan Xing Court. The police department's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, filed a public prosecution for negligent business negligence leading to death and requested strict punishment. Jiang Shouyan, the father of the deceased, is 58 years old and is supported by the deceased for his livelihood. Therefore, the lawyer for the deceased attached a civil suit to the defendant's principal, Wu Dongchu, requesting compensation for the funeral expenses of his son and his pension of 4,200 yuan. Judge Huang asked both defendants for clarification and sentenced Xu Fenghao to eight months of imprisonment as a warning.

### Huang Jiegang Accused of Bigamy: Married Two Women One After Another

Huang Jiegang, a 26-year-old man from Chongming, works in the catering department of a certain hotel. On May 18, 1938, he married a fellow villager Zhu (27 years old this year) through a matchmaker. After the marriage in the countryside, they lived together for only three days before Huang came to Shanghai, leaving his wife in the countryside. Unexpectedly, on December 12 of last year, Huang married Zhang Min (23 years old this year), a woman from Wuxi, at the Zhongshe Auditorium on Weihaiwei Road and lived together at No. 18 Changxingli, Beile Road, French Concession. The day before yesterday, Huang Zhu, Huang's first wife (now residing at No. 283 Annakin Road), hired lawyer Zhang Shibian to report her husband to the French police station for

Requesting Detention.

Investigation. The detectives accompanied her and arrested Huang and Zhang Min and brought them to the case. After questioning, Huang was taken into custody, and Zhang Min was asked to leave to await verification. Yesterday afternoon, the police department sent the case to the first criminal division of the Special District Court. After Judge Miao Qingbang's trial, the police department's lawyer Yuan Jiahong said that the defendant requested a postponement for further investigation and questioning due to the bigamy case. He also asked the plaintiff Huang Zhu and her agent, lawyer Zhang Shibian, to arrive in court to testify about the marriage in the countryside and present the marriage certificate as evidence. Because the notice was sent in the countryside, he only found out that they were married. He rushed to the Zhongshe that day to reason with them, but Huang and Zhang had already completed the marriage. Seeing us go, they ran away, so we only obtained their

Marriage Certificate

And other words to question Huang denied that he had married Zhu. It was arranged by his parents since he was a child. He opposed it at the age of twenty and asked to terminate the contract. They wanted me to pay 500 yuan to settle the matter. I only paid 300 yuan, so it was not resolved. He has been in love with Zhang for four years and hired lawyer Ma Nangeng to defend him and requested bail. The court held that the defendant had not terminated the marriage contract, which was not in compliance with the law, and that the case had jurisdiction issues. It was decided to postpone the hearing to the 18th. The defendant was taken into custody.

### Youth Zhou Lin Arrested for Fraudulently Obtaining Passport Fees by Impersonating the National Government

Zhou Lin, a local youth who lived at No. 20 Auliffe Road in the French Concession, is 22 years old this year. He lost his job after the war and was extremely poor. He impersonated the Chongqing National Government to recruit male and female youths for work-study programs for training. He defrauded each person of 15 yuan for passport fees on the grounds that they would be employed as lieutenants after graduation. Zhou issued a receipt with the seal of Chen Guofu, chairman of the admissions committee, as evidence. For a time, 50 to 60 young men and women students went to register. After Zhou obtained the passport fees, he avoided meeting people and indulged in the Shanghai West gambling den, causing doubts among the students. A representative was elected to report to the French Concession Police Department, and a detective was dispatched to arrest Zhou Lin. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the eighth criminal division of the Second Court for trial by Judge Li Weishan. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he was unemployed and had no way to make a living, so he did this fraud. He asked the presiding judge to consider him young and give him a lighter sentence. The court ruled that the investigation by the police department was not completed and postponed the hearing to the 19th.

### Salary Increase for Court Employees in the Second Special District Was Satisfactory

The details have been reported in the previous newspaper. It is now learned that this matter was approved by the President of the Third Branch, Yang Peng, and Chen Xian of the Second Special Court out of consideration for the lower circumstances. It was approved that starting this month, each person will be temporarily given a subsidy of 5 yuan per month. On the one hand, other methods will be found.

### Detective Jiang Zhendong and Others Conspire to Extort: Awaiting Trial in Special Court

Bao Ming, an unemployed youth from Ningbo, colluded with Detective Jiang Zhendong No. 537 of the French Police Department and a Westerner on the run at 10:00 AM on the 5th of this month, and went to Yuancheng Cotton Cloth Store at No. 50 Longquan Garden, Tianjin Road, to search for opium as a pretext and extorted 500 yuan from Yu Zhixin but failed.

Business News

### Grain: Flour Now Selling for 9.80 Yuan; Australian Wheat Fixed at Over 7,000 Tons, More Expensive Than Previous Orders

The flour market is experiencing rising prices. The wholesale price in the city has risen sharply by 30 cents since the New Year, reaching the 9 yuan mark. It then continued to rise by 40 cents, followed by another 20 cents the day before yesterday, and another 20 cents yesterday. The official price of No. 2 flour has been changed to 9.80 yuan in cash. The price increases are remarkably rapid. In the past, rumors of factories ordering large quantities of imported wheat led people to believe that imported wheat was cheaper than local wheat. Since raw materials could be obtained from imported wheat, it was thought that the price of flour would not rise again. Unexpectedly, imported wheat is scarce due to a shortage of shipping space. Except for the Fufeng Factory, which actually ordered a ship, the rest were just rumors. The price increases in the flour market continued one after another, which was quite unexpected. At the same time, wheat prices also repeatedly reached new records. Until yesterday, the Fuxin Factory ordered a ship of Australian wheat, estimated at over 7,000 tons, at a price of 23.60 yuan, which is 3.50 yuan higher than the first batch ordered by the Fufeng Factory. With the high price of raw materials for flour production, the cost is naturally higher. Therefore, the price increases in the flour market are unlikely to subside. The future situation will depend on the future of the wheat market. Yesterday, retail transactions in the city were still active, but customer purchases were restricted by the factories, and there was no official market temporarily. It is said that North and South Sea merchants, seeing that the price of flour has exceeded 10 yuan, while imported flours such as "Warship Brand" are only 20 cents higher, are purchasing imported flour. Several thousand bags were sold. The spot price of the Japanese "Phoenix Brand" flour has also risen from 9.70 yuan to over 10 yuan. Futures trading is not open. The settlement price for January is 9.70 yuan, and the settlement price for February is 10 yuan. Yesterday, 7,000 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong.

The wheat market is quite brisk. After the selling price of Changzhou-Wuxi local wheat reached a high point of 17 yuan, hoarding increased. Therefore, the market became more and more expensive. Yesterday, the asking price for extra-grade wheat was 17.56 yuan, but it was not an official price. It is said that the factories are temporarily holding back and there are no official transactions. The market had about three or four cars of Zhongguan wheat trading, with the price still at 17 yuan.

### Rice Prices Remain Firm; Imported Rice Arrives

After rice prices rebounded yesterday, the supply from the Hongkou district was still limited yesterday. Merchants were also holding on, intending to buy. Therefore, the situation in the morning was tight. Except for early rice, where the market supply was still abundant and there was not much change, the market supply of thick and thin japonica rice was limited, and the asking price was quite high. However, local shops, also with heavy capital, except for meeting some retail demand, did not dare to buy much. As a result, the market only improved by 20 to 30 cents. Only white yuan rice, which had been heavily discounted in the past two days, rose by half a yuan as soon as there was demand. The sales of various imported rice were still smooth. From morning to noon, they were active. No. 1 Saigon rice was offered at 37.23 yuan, No. 2 Saigon rice was sold at 36.50 yuan to 36.25 yuan, broken rice was 33 yuan, and Tokyo pearl rice was 34 yuan to 33.80 yuan. Although the prices were similar to the day before yesterday, they were 30 to 40 cents higher than the mid-market price. The total transaction volume was about 7,000 to 8,000 bags.

Imported rice shops are transferring orders to Hong Kong. Because import prices are not decreasing, importers are holding back and not selling freely. Therefore, people's confidence is increasing, and spot prices are being raised uniformly. A small number of original bags of No. 1 rice were sold, and the price was also raised to 44 yuan.

Imported rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Jia Ying ship brought 5,060 bags from Saigon and 3,558 bags from Hong Kong, totaling 8,618 bags. It was imported yesterday morning and docked at the French Concession's Bank of China wharf. The unloading has already been completed.

### Securities: Bond Market Firm

The securities gray market was almost identical to the day before yesterday. Although selling pressure was strong, it failed to overwhelm the bullish forces. Short covering and profit-taking occurred simultaneously. However, the 20th of the month saw a larger volume, so the bullish side prevailed in the end. The future is still uncertain. Trading was extremely sparse yesterday morning. Selling pressure was slightly stronger, and prices were slightly weak. There was more short covering at noon. The 20th suddenly joined the bullish side, and the Da Sheng buying appetite was also strong, so the market rebounded slightly. As a result, except for Type D, which did not change, the rest rose by 5 cents to 1.5 cents. The transaction volume was about 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Type  | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
Type A | 62.00 | 61.85 | 61.90 | Up 0.10
Type B | 52.90 | 52.65 | 52.80 | Up 0.15
Type D | 50.55 | 50.30 | 50.50 | Up 0.10
Type C | 48.95 | 48.80 | 48.90 | Flat
Type E | 50.10 | 49.90 | 50.05 | Up 0.05

Stock trading: 30 shares of Zhen Tai Spinning Factory were traded at a price of 70 yuan.

Yesterday, the stock market of the Public Industry Association opened with a weaker trend in rubber stocks due to the decline in international spot prices. Later, because buyers followed one another, the market rebounded at the close, and the prices of many excellent stocks were particularly strong. In the industrial stock sector, Shanghai Silver Company shares made further progress, but Ewo Cotton Mill shares remained the leader. At the close, there were buyers at a price of 35 yuan.

London, 10th: Today, the listed prices of Far East companies' stocks on the London Stock Exchange rose again. HSBC Bank's UK-registered shares rose by £1 to £86.5. Hong Kong-registered shares rose by £1.5 to £88. Kulac Lim Bang rubber shares rose by 7.5 pence to 23 shillings 1.5 pence. However, Macquarie Bank shares fell by 2 shillings 6 pence to £8 15 shillings. The rest remained unchanged.

London, 10th: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable. Only the Rehabilitation Loan (issued in the UK) fell by £1 to £44. The rest remained flat.

### Yarn and Cotton: After Several Days of Decline, the Yarn Market Rebounds Suddenly; Double Horse Returns to 720 Yuan

The yarn market first weakened and then strengthened, showing a slightly positive trend. This was because Hong Kong merchants made some purchases. In addition, after many days of weak transportation, speculators, seeing that the decline was slowing, became active and pushed prices up. Therefore, the market rebounded sharply from low to high. However, the amount of yarn in storage is increasing daily. There is still no hope for large-scale development in the spot market. However, after falling for many days, this rebound was expected and not surprising.

The opening momentum in the spot market this morning was still flat and weak. Because the three major cotton markets overseas continued to decline and there was no major change in foreign exchange rates, sentiment remained weak. However, some people, because prices had fallen for several days, adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, the opening price of 20-count Double Horse was 705 yuan. Later, scalpers, seeing that the situation had stabilized, suddenly came in to buy, and the price gradually rebounded to 720 yuan at the close. However, actual transactions were still as sluggish as ever. Statistics show that various merchants bought a total of 2,235 bales in the first half of the day. The price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 10 yuan, Heavenly Maiden rose by 10 yuan, and Double Globe rose by 8 yuan.

### Cotton Market Extremely Quiet

The cotton trade remains quiet. Factory demand is also sluggish and not rising. Transactions between merchants are also quiet. In addition, with the Lunar New Year approaching, everyone is preparing to close their books and celebrate, so there is a lack of enthusiasm for business. As for prices, they are also in a quiet state. Bulls have no intention of selling, so the market is extremely stable. However, overseas cotton markets are trending downwards. If they continue to fall and there is no change in foreign exchange rates, the cotton market will naturally be weak. 2,645 bales of Nantong cotton from northern Jiangsu arrived, 236 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 1,480 bales of northern sand cotton. The situation of spot cotton is as follows:

Dazhongji | 210.00 | Same Trade | 110 bales

Middling | 140.00 | Shenxin | 500 pieces

Fire Machine Bales | 169.00 | Same Trade | 200 pieces

Fire Grass Bales | 16.00 | Also | 180 bales

Grass Bales | 158.50 | Also | 200 bales

Fire Wooden Frames | 16.00 | Also | 160 bales

Nantong Cotton | 170.00 | Also | 190 bales

In addition, the price of foreign cotton is: The New York cotton market has been weak recently. Initially, it was due to sales by overseas merchants, and later due to profit-taking by bulls, it was extremely weak. The decline in the cotton market was due to the low stock market. As a result, the closing price fell by 5, 6 to over 10 points compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rebounded by more than 4 rupees. Egyptian cotton rose by more than 10 points. Liverpool fell by 8 pence.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trade is very quiet. Everyone is very apprehensive about the unpredictable changes in exchange rates and the decline in US cotton prices. Unless the price is particularly cheap, there is no intention to buy. Japanese manufacturers also have no buying appetite due to the poor performance of yarn prices. The prices to factories, converted at a US exchange rate of 7.9375 yuan, are as follows:

20-count | US Middling | 227.20

Also | Lower Grade | 123.95

32-count | US Middling | 239.50

Also | Lower Grade | 132.70

42-count | US Middling | 144.20

Also | Lower Grade | 235.95

### Finance: Quiet Exchange Market

Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's listing had no changes. The gray market for British and American exchanges was even more sluggish due to the weekend. Although Li & Fung and others were buying in the middle, Hong Kong was selling, resulting in no major changes. Large operators have not taken any action this week, so future changes depend on the opening of next Monday. Because of the continued rise in British and American exchange rates this morning, the market opened with a picture of British parity and American weakness. It was quiet for a while, but after 10 o'clock, foreign banks and Li & Fung suddenly entered the market to buy, and the supply from domestic banks was poor, softening to 4 shillings 8.125 pence and 7.9375 yuan.

Few January to February swaps were opened. A certain Chinese bank was paying in American dollars 0.125, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 1.56 percent (excluding commission).

Later, it was suddenly heard that swaps were opened. It is estimated that Chinese banks Guangdong were buying in the current month and selling out in February, paying in American dollars 0.125, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 1.56 percent (excluding commission).

It opened stably in the morning, still at 4,085 yuan. Subsequently, gold dealers and securities firms sold each other, and it fell sharply to 4,079 yuan. Because the exchange market was slightly tight and a certain money changer came to push in, it stabilized slightly for a while.

Securities firms sold 10 taels to money changers for 4,079 yuan. Subsequently, the exchange market softened and a certain money changer came to buy cheaply, so it recovered 2 yuan.

The Flying Qilin label is 48 yuan, the Renqiang 46 yuan, the Sanx 46 yuan, the KG 46 yuan, and the Shuang A 39 yuan.

### Oil Market: Soybean oil in stalemate

The soybean oil market is brewing but not changing. Although the source is not surging, more than 5,000 barrels of crude oil detained in Dalian have made people think that once it is released, a setback is inevitable. Therefore, buyers are watching for major changes. Sellers are holding back on other oils, due to the difficulty of transportation and the high cost, most are unwilling to sell lightly, so the buying and selling stalemate has been going on for three days without a market.

Yesterday, 1,800 cans of raw oil came from Yantai, and 1,320 cans came from Qingdao. Today, 1,220 bags of soybeans, 2,190 bags of raw peanuts, and 1,130 cans of raw oil are being shipped to Hong Kong.

### Silk and Tea: Japan-US relations affect the silk market

The overseas silk market has fallen more and more sharply. New York Sino-Japanese raw silk fell 90 cents to over 30 cents. Both the near and far terms fell by 25 cents. Yokohama stopped shooting due to the fall, and the silk market could not find a standard for a while. Observers said that the current drop in silk prices is related to the Japanese tide and the US Far East policy. Based on the current New York price of silk, yesterday's market record has fallen by 70 cents compared to the end of the previous month. The local silk market is in a state of distress and there have been no transactions. Today, there are three pieces of silk and fifty pieces of tea being shipped to Hong Kong.

### Observing the Silk Market from New York Raw Silk Statistics: Prosperity Without a Real Foundation

The New York and Yokohama silk markets in December of last year rose sharply. It can be called unprecedented, which led to speculative frenzy in Shanghai and participation in the selling and buying short on the New York Stock Exchange. The silk price record, New York recently rose from 3.34 yuan to 4.255 yuan, Yokohama spot rose from 1,850 yuan to 2,370 yuan, a difference of 520 yuan. At that time, the market news said that the reasons for the decline in Japanese silk shipments to the United States and the high consumption in New York, etc. However, a test of the facts is not entirely true. According to the Reuters New York raw silk statistics, the general situation of New York raw silk inventory and sales in December was in the shrinking and the inventory increased by 13,683 units. Where is the reason? The reporter's opinion, (1) The general index of New York increased due to the concentration of European hot money for hoarding and the prosperity of the US military industry, which increased the general purchasing power. The silk price is no exception. (2) The Sino-US trade agreement is uncertain, and raw silk is most popular in the market. (3) Domestic prices in Japan are soaring, and the main reason for the increase in silk prices in December should not be the above three points. According to the above statistics, the increase and decrease of New York raw silk, compared with the previous month and the same month of the previous year, is shrinking in the three items of import, consumption, and inventory. Therefore, the increase in silk prices and the prosperity of the silk market have no reliable actual basis. The New York raw silk statistics for December are listed below.

Silk Category | Import units | Sales units | Inventory units
---|---|---|---
Japanese silk | 26,265 | 16,598 | 43,097
European silk | 599 | 271 | 1,249
Guangdong silk | 1,379 | 437 | 2,668
Shanghai silk | 6,568 | 3,822 | 8,596
Total this month | 34,82 | 3,38 | 55,610
Total last month | 38,233 | 32,241 | 41,927
Total last year | 42,266 | 35,204 | 53,278

### Metals: Native Nails and Steel Bars Remain Firm and Expensive, but Actual Sales are Very Sluggish

Recently, the purchasing power of the hardware merchant community has visibly weakened, the market situation is bleak, and actual sales have dried up. Yesterday's market was slightly better, but the volume was very small. About two hundred barrels of native nails were purchased, and twenty to thirty tons of bamboo steel bars were purchased. However, due to the European war, the source of hardware has not been smooth. People are optimistic, and both insiders and outsiders have the idea of ​​hoarding for profit, waiting for a good price in the future market. Therefore, the current market price also has a tendency to rise and not fall. For example, each barrel of Bei Shi brand nails is 48 yuan, and steel bars such as three-tenths and four-tenths are sold for 820 yuan per ton, from five-tenths to one inch are sold for 760 yuan per ton, all of which are 10 to 20 yuan higher than before. In addition, plain white iron is sold for 7 yuan and 9 jiao per eleven pounds, 9 yuan and 3 jiao per fourteen pounds, 190 yuan for double-jointed tinplate, 150 yuan for Company iron, 85 yuan for new lead wire, 40 yuan for white lead wire, 900 yuan for original bundles of 2,000 pounds of black iron billets, 85 yuan per box of 200 pounds of goods, and about 700 yuan per barrel of white lead skin, all slightly higher than before. However, we only hear the asking price, and there is no actual transaction to be seen.

### Points to Note Before and After Exams

— Yong

The mid-term exams for elementary and middle schools in this city have been rescheduled to begin on January 15th, with three days of major exams. (See the Education News column of this newspaper on the 6th) Therefore, these days, all the children are definitely not interested in playing anymore. After school, they open their schoolbags and review all kinds of homework, hoping to get good grades in the exams. Here, let me write something about the things that should be paid attention to before and after the exam.

There are two things that should be noted most before the exam: First, review everything early and thoroughly. Don't wait until the night before the exam to cram. The so-called "temporary embrace of Buddha's feet" is the most stupid and ineffective way to study, which is harmful to the body; on the other hand, the future results will definitely not be better than others. Second, before the exam, you should first organize the things you need to use, so as not to lack this and that at the time of the exam, which will affect the exam time.

As for the matters that should be paid attention to during the exam, there are too many to mention. Here are some of the important ones: First, when you get the test paper, you must not panic; do the easy ones first. I have seen many children who are well prepared before the exam, but when it comes to the exam, they can't write a word. This is because they have not calmed their inner heart. Second, absolutely do not cheat. If you can't do it yourself, don't do it. If you secretly look, you will not only be punished by the teacher, but you will also feel ashamed in your heart. In some schools in the United States, during exams, the teacher hands out the test papers and then runs out of the classroom, but everyone does not cheat. Third, you must have a spirit of cleanliness. Many children often make a test paper dirty, writing here and there, which makes people feel disgusted when they see it. Therefore, the words should be neat and the paper should be clean, which is also one of the things to pay attention to during the exam.

Finally, regarding the exam that has already ended, I also have a few words to offer to everyone; those who do well should not think that they are satisfied and no longer want to seek further gains. Those who do badly should not be discouraged. If they can continue to work hard, they can also become outstanding in the future.

The above is just some platitudes; however, as long as you can put it into practice and "do" it, that's good.

### Another Record of the Orphanage

— Yingdai

The Shanghai Refugee Children's Home held a ceremony for the completion of the new house on New Year's Day of the current year; at the same time, it exhibited calligraphy and paintings for five days. Details have been seen in various newspapers. Here are some other things to tell the children who care about the refugee children.

A Glimpse of the New House The Shanghai Refugee Children's Home is located at No. 99, Lane 258, Wuding Road. There are a total of 27 buildings, all built with money donated by major philanthropists. Walking into a narrow alley, after a short distance, is the seventeen new houses of the Refugee Children's Home. All of them are buildings, arranged in a long row, with a long corridor that can lead to each room. Downstairs are classrooms and offices. The rooms upstairs are similar to the rooms downstairs. There is also a long corridor, but most of it is occupied by the dormitories of the refugee children. All the classrooms and bedrooms are very clean. There is a narrow courtyard in front. In addition to classrooms and bedrooms, there are kitchens, toilets, bathrooms, dining halls, large auditoriums, and movie rooms. The facilities can be said to be quite perfect. On the side facing Kang Nao Tuo Road, there is also a field for the refugee children to rest. In short, the children who have suffered can be nurtured in such a place, which is fortunate enough. At the same time, we also express considerable admiration for the philanthropists and service personnel who are enthusiastic about rescuing refugee children!

Slogans Wording This time, when we went in to attend the ceremony for the completion of the new house, we saw the slogans posted on the walls. I am afraid that everyone will involuntarily express great sympathy for the general refugee children. It is okay to copy them below; (1) Look at the suffering of the refugee children, think about your own life, (2) The refugee children did not do evil, but they are unfortunate, (3) The gentlemen and ladies who care about this hospital are the saviors of the refugee children. (4) Educating and nurturing refugee children is to reserve talents for the country. (5) Doing good and giving alms is sowing good fruits. (6) Mutual assistance and fraternity are the virtues of mankind. (7) Helping refugee children is better than burning incense and eating vegetarian food. (8) Giving money to help refugee children is really a penny that does not fall into the void; (9) Loving other people's children is loving your own children; (10) Those who have enough food and clothing should plan for the homeless refugee children; (11) Save your candy expenses and your makeup expenses, and you can support several refugee children; (12) For a bowl of porridge and a meal, always think about where it comes from; (13) Encountering difficulties and being trapped can temper your body and mind; (14) Hard work and perseverance can shoulder heavy responsibilities.

Life of Refugee Children The Shanghai Refugee Children's Home was established in May of the 27th year of the Republic of China, so it has only a short year and a half of history. However, the number of refugee children admitted has increased from 16 to 517. Therefore, it is very inconvenient to have no spacious houses to educate and nurture them. Now that the new house has been completed, this problem has been solved. The daily life of the refugee children in the orphanage is disciplined. Going to class during the day, eating meals, turning off the lights at night, and going to bed are all on time. Everyone wears blue cotton jackets and trousers, and blue cotton overcoats. Every day, they eat coarse tea and simple meals. The meals are only one soup and one dish per meal. They have not tasted the taste of fish and meat at all. Inside the bedroom, all are double-decker beds, with two people sharing one quilt. In addition to reading, there is also a considerable amount of exercise every day. Moreover, attention is also paid to industrial guidance and practice, so that they can not only read and write in the future, but also have a skill. When we went in, we saw that every refugee child was very energetic, and we felt that although these five hundred children are now suffering, they will all be useful talents in the future!

### Talking About the Dragon in the Year of the Dragon

— Dazhai

The Lunar New Year has been over for more than ten days. This year is the year of the Dragon. There is a Yunnan folk tale about the Dragon Ball, which is quite interesting. Let me tell it to the children.

There was a child named Ming'er. His father died early in his childhood. His mother worked hard to raise Ming'er. His mother wove cloth to make a living every day. When Ming'er was eight or nine years old, he went up the mountain to cut grass. He sold the cut grass at the market and exchanged it for rice to take home. The mother and son helped each other in this way, living a life of mutual dependence. One day, Ming'er reached the top of the mountain and found a green grassland more than a foot high. He quickly started working. In no time, he happily cut a large load of grass.

The second day, he went to the mountain again. When he reached the green grassland he had cut yesterday, he was very surprised. He never expected that the green grass he had cut yesterday would grow more than a foot high overnight. He cut these grasses again. For several days in a row, he went to that grassland to cut grass. New grass grew every day, cutting after growing, and growing after cutting. Later, curiosity drove him. He thought to himself, maybe there is something in the grassland!

Therefore, he brought a shovel to cut the grass. After cutting the grass, he used the shovel to dig into the ground. The deeper he dug, the deeper he dug. Finally, he found a small bead, shining with a glittering light, very beautiful. He took it home and said to his mother that it must be a treasure. But his mother said that it was just an ordinary and beautiful bead, and she didn't value it very much. Who knew that in the evening, the house was not lit, but it was as bright as the sun. It turned out that the bead on the table was shining, and then she felt that it was really a treasure. When she went to bed, she put it in the cabinet with only a little rice left to treasure it.

The next morning, the mother prepared to cook rice. When she opened the lid of the rice cabinet, it turned into two cabinets of white rice. The mother was surprised and said it was terrible. She ordered Ming'er that it was indeed a good treasure and that he must not tell others. But Ming'er was straightforward and told people, so it spread throughout the village, and everyone in the village knew about it.

In the end, Ming'er was asked by the villagers to see what the bead looked like. Ming'er honestly took it out. The people with bad intentions wanted to rob him of the bead, causing a disturbance. He took the bead and ran away in a hurry. Many people chased after him. He was so anxious that he had no choice but to put the bead in his mouth. Carelessly, he swallowed it. After the people dispersed, he had no choice but to go home. He was extremely thirsty and drank all the water in the jar, but he was still not thirsty. He took the bucket to the river to fetch water and drank many buckets in a row, but he was still not thirsty. So he opened his mouth and drank the water in the river. He looked at his reflection in the river and saw that two horns had grown on his head. Finally, his clothes fell off, and scales grew all over his body. He wanted to speak but could not make a sound, and he wanted to cry but could not cry.

When his mother went to the river to look for him, he had already turned into a little dragon in the water, nodding to her. The mother cried and shouted. He kept looking at his mother and nodding, reluctant to leave, but he could not help himself and swam along the river. The mother and son separated from then on.

### Black Brothers (1)

— Yimu

In ancient Styria, in a mountainous and secluded place, there was a valley where the land was very fertile. It was surrounded by mountains of varying heights. High peaks stood in mid-air, often covered with white snow. The water in the mountain streams poured down and turned into many waterfalls. One of the waterfalls poured down towards the west, spilling onto a mountain rock. At sunset, everything below was dark, and the afterglow of the setting sun shone on the waterfall, making it look like a shower of gold was falling there. The nearby people therefore gave it a nickname, called the Golden River. Strangely enough, the Golden River did not pour into the valley below, but poured into the other side of the mountain, flowing through a vast plain and many populous cities. But the snow-capped mountains often had clouds gathering there, and they covered the foot of the mountains. Therefore, in the dry and hot season, although the wilderness was scorching hot as if it were about to burn, the valley often had light rain; everything was particularly abundant, the grass was tall, the apples were red, the grapes were purple, and the honey was sweet. Everyone was happy and surprised when they saw it. Therefore, they gave the valley another name, called the White Treasure Valley.

The entire valley was the property of three brothers. The eldest was named Xi Hua, the second was named Han Shi, and the youngest was named Ge Le. Xi Hua and Han Shi were both ugly men. Under their thick and heavy eyebrows, there were two pairs of dull little eyes, often half-open and half-closed, so you could hardly see their eyes, and you wouldn't feel that they were looking at you.

The brothers relied on cultivating Baishi Valley for a living, and they were all good farmers. All birds and animals that came to steal their crops were killed alive by them. They often shot dead mountain birds because they pecked at their fruits; they had to kill hedgehogs when they saw them, fearing that they would suck the milk of the cows; crickets ate crumbs of bread in the kitchen, so they tried to poison them one by one; even the cicadas that chirped on the linden trees all summer could not escape their poisonous hands, because they were too noisy.

The hired workers they employed were never paid wages. When the workers refused to work, they took advantage of the quarrel and drove them out without paying a penny. They had such a good farm and used such harsh means. Therefore, they became richer day by day. After each harvest of grain, they hoarded it and refused to sell it, and had to wait for the market price to rise twice as high before selling it; their land was full of money rolling around, but they never gave a penny or a piece of bread to the poor; they never attended Mass in the church; when the government came to collect one-tenth of the tax, they complained and cursed all day long; in short, they were both cruel and stingy, and everyone who did business with them gave them a nickname, called the "Black Brothers."

The youngest of the three brothers, Ge Le, was completely the opposite of his two brothers. Both his appearance and personality were beyond the expectations of the neighbors. He was not yet twelve years old, and he was very handsome, with blue eyes like the sea. Their personalities were also extraordinarily gentle, treating everyone and every creature with the original way. Of course, he didn't get along with his two stingy brothers, and the two brothers also looked down on him.

### The Fourth US Naval Concert Held Every Sunday Morning at the Grand Theater

— Xinliang

This magazine once had an article about music in Shanghai bars, saying that there are too few opportunities to listen to music in Shanghai. Except for a few concerts that are occasionally held, those friends who love music have to run to the bars. Indeed, pure music is not easy to hear in Shanghai. The Municipal Council's string orchestra performs various symphonic pieces at the Lyceum Theater every Sunday, which is very good, but unfortunately you have to buy tickets. Here, let me introduce a free opportunity to listen to music.

We probably all know that in the Grand Theater, there is always a US Naval Worship service held every Sunday morning at 10:00 am. After the worship, there are several musical programs that are very wonderful. (They are not a string orchestra, but a wind band) Several majestic marches will really make you excited and dance with joy, and naturally a surge of uncontrollable heat will rise in your heart.

If you are looking for some entertainment every Sunday morning, you might as well go there to listen to this concert. Tickets are not required. You can comfortably recline on the soft sofa from 10:00 am to 11:30 am and enjoy that noble music.

Sometimes, in addition to the ordinary programs, there are also various special singing programs, including solos and choruses. In short, it is very worthwhile to spend a full hour and a half here.

### Assassinating the Tiger (2)

— Xiaotian

Chen Yunshang's starring film "Fei Zhen'e Assassinating the Tiger" is being screened at the Golden City Theater, and its box office has been strong for more than ten days. Zhang Eyun, the golden pillar, is performing "Fei Zhen'e Assassinating the Tiger" for the first time, and the seats were sold out the day before. It seems that Fei Zhen'e is really having good luck. "Assassinating the Tiger" is originally a scene from the Kun opera "Iron Crown", which is usually performed by Kun opera troupes, from "Farewell to Mother", "Chaos Arrows", "Striking the Bell", "Dividing the Palace", to "Assassinating the Tiger". "Farewell to Mother" and "Chaos Arrows" are called "Ning Wu Pass", which was one of Tan Xinpei's masterpieces in those years. Since Tan passed away, only Shuyan can slightly pass on his mantle. Now that he has stopped performing, this play is not easy to perform anymore. As far as I have seen, Mei Lanfang is the first choice for "Assassinating the Tiger". I once learned this play from Ding Lansun, who was a student of Zhou Fenglin, a famous Kun opera performer. Lanfang has made some changes to the body movements in this play. After singing "Rolling Embroidered Ball", he adds the "Wan Nian Huan" tune, performing various expressions. Under "Da Dao Ling" and "One Night Husband and Wife, Hundred Nights of Grace", he adds a table-turning and seat-reversing body movement. After singing "Yao Pian", he points out the dagger, but does not assassinate the tiger immediately. He adds body movements such as touching the account and listening for the sound of hiding. When assassinating the tiger, he reduces the Acacia somersault. When singing "Chao Tian Zi", he throws away the precious sword. In my opinion, it is better than the old version. Its wonderfulness and beauty cannot be compared by mediocre people.

Cheng Yanqiu's performance of this play was learned from Lanfang, but it starts from "Dividing the Palace", which can be closely followed by "Ning Wu Pass", with a sacrifice scene added in the middle, singing a large section of counter-tune. Zhang Eyun's performance this time is based on Cheng's version, but the scenes before the sacrifice have been slightly altered. She is quite willing to learn Cheng's counter-tune during the sacrifice. The fine sound is good, but the pronunciation is slightly weak. The scene of assassinating the tiger is still sung in Kun opera, which is said to be learned from Zhu Chuanming. The singing is not difficult to listen to, but the body movements and expressions are rarely good. In the "Xiao Liang Zhou" section, when singing the sentence "Tighten the embroidered skirt", she has not yet taken off the phoenix crown, and the dagger has not been inserted in the waist skirt. The body movement of the sentence "Lining the treasure knife in the heart" has no way to make it, but these are all due to clumsiness, and it is not a deep disease.

The film "Assassinating the Tiger" being screened at the Golden City Theater seems to be more tense and moving than the Peking opera in terms of its arrangement and editing. The whole play takes Fei Zhen'e as the main trunk, from the time when the thief falls into Nanyang and Zhen'e escapes, to the assassination of the tiger. In the middle, it inserts Chongzhen's goodness but inability to use it, and evil but inability to remove it, Zhou Kui and others' greed for money and short-sightedness, which misleads the country and harms the people, which can all be thought-provoking. In general, people's feelings are that if you treat me well, I will treat you well; if you abuse me, I will hate you. Therefore, there is a saying that if officials do not harm the people, the people will not rebel. Confucius said, if his body is upright, he will act without being ordered; if his body is not upright, he will not obey even if he is ordered. Chongzhen indulged his father-in-law, which led to bribery becoming a common practice, bandits rising, families having no peace, and people living in misery. Even if he had a patriotic heart, how could he not resign his blame? Chen Yunshang showed several charming attitudes in the bridal chamber, which is enough to reconcile the audience's emotions. Her attitude is indeed charming, but as for the lyrics sung when dancing with the sword, will the composer say that Li Hu has heard them, or has not heard them? It is inevitable that too much emphasis is placed on artistic tendencies.

### "Empress Dowager Cixi" Watching "Empress Dowager Cixi"

— Jin Yuanliang

This year can really be called the "Year of Empress Dowager Cixi", right? In terms of drama, "China Travel", "Green Treasure", and "West Wind" have all competed to announce this play ("Green Treasure's" "Empress Dowager Cixi" is currently being performed). In terms of movies, after the Minhua Company finished filming "Confucius", it also decided to start filming "Empress Dowager Cixi", and very carefully cooperated with the United Company. At the same time, they were not afraid of the long journey and brought Ying Yin over.

After Ying Yin arrived in Shanghai, in addition to finding a house and visiting old friends, she spent her free time collecting and reading books about "Empress Dowager Cixi's" deeds, which showed her hard work. And the Green Real Theater's "Empress Dowager Cixi" happened to be staged at this time. In order to provide reference for the country, it was of course necessary to visit it.

The Green Treasure Theater has been performing "Empress Dowager Cixi" for a week, and the business is so good that it cannot be added. In addition to Ying Yin, Wei Ruhui, the author of "Remnants of the Late Ming Dynasty", also watched the play yesterday. Wei Ruhui is currently writing "Empress Dowager Cixi" for "China Travel". Someone waited for him to finish the play and asked him what his opinions were. He said: "It is very worthy for us to learn from and admire the serious and earnest attitude of the Green Treasure gentlemen in engaging in the performance of this play."

In addition to Wei Ruhui and others, it is said that Fei Mu and Wu Yonggang will also watch the play in the next few days. Fei Mu will direct the "Empress Dowager Cixi" film, and "China Travel's" "Empress Dowager Cixi" is Wu and Yonggang's second collaboration with Wei Ruhui after "Remnants of the Late Ming Dynasty".

In the past, many people regarded Green Treasure's plays as civilized plays and dismissed them. Judging from the popularity and attention of "Empress Dowager Cixi", it has already given people a refreshing impression.

(24) Double Reed

The performance of the double reed is that two actors "make gestures" on the stage, seemingly "speaking and singing", but in fact they never open their mouths; another actor is hidden behind them, following the rhythm of the actions of the one in front "singing at the top of their lungs".

It is clearly the singing of the "behind-the-scenes person", but it looks like it is coming from the one in front. The funny and humorous part of the double reed is this point.

### Outside the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Handsome man Li Xiangyun and Zang Languang

Stage experience is not rich, and the plays he is good at are only half-baked. He felt that he could not obtain the approval of true music lovers in Ping, so he secretly went to the Northeast. He performed several times in Changchun and received a lot of praise. It happened that a certain dignitary there especially favored him and spared no effort to support him. If Zang could cherish his reputation and focus on performing, he could not only earn a lot of money at this time as a foundation for further studies after returning to Ping in the future, but also rely on the power of a certain dignitary to create his own theater and take on the role of manager. If I took his troupe to perform in the major commercial ports of the three provinces in turn, the profit would be even greater. Unexpectedly, he did not restrain himself, but secretly had an affair with a certain dignitary's concubine. The matter was discovered by the dignitary, who was ashamed and angry, and resented his unscrupulousness. So he added the crime of espionage, detained him, and tortured him. His skin was broken and bleeding, and he almost suffered a death. Later, thanks to the rescue of all parties, Zang was able to escape back to his hometown in a mess. Since then, he has disappeared and deeply regretted his actions. It has been several years since I heard of his whereabouts. When I first saw Li Zang, I thought he was a promising talent. At a time when male dan actors are lacking successors, he is indeed a rare talent. I often encouraged them both, but unexpectedly they both only shone for a moment and then withered away. From this, I increasingly feel the sigh of having talent is difficult. (173)

### The Current Stage of the European War: An Anti-Soviet War Is Brewing

— Xiao Zhen

——The German-Polish War Was Its Prelude——

——The Western Front Warfare Is Its Postlude——

——The Soviet-Finnish War Is Its Interlude——

Since the beginning of the German-Polish War, all countries in Europe, large and small, have been living in wartime conditions. However, on the surface, only five countries are actually engaged in warfare: the Anglo-French war against Germany in Western Europe, and the Soviet Union's war against Finland in Northern Europe.

Regarding the war in Western Europe, it has been four months since Britain and France declared war on Germany. Initially, there were some small-scale engagements between the Maginot Line and the Siegfried Line, but now even skirmishes have ceased. During World War I, the German army had already shelled the suburbs of Paris four weeks after the start of the war, but now the two sides have not crossed the line even a single step. Generally speaking, the belligerents in Western Europe have shifted their entire force from the military front to the diplomatic front, especially the economic front.

In these four months, the war continuation on the military front, which can be recorded comparatively, includes: on the naval front, the submarine warfare and mine warfare in the English Channel, and the encounter between the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee and three British cruisers in the South Atlantic; on the air force front, the larger air wars include the German aircraft raids on the British coast, and the two British aircraft raids on the German naval base of Heligoland (in the latter, 34 British aircraft were shot down, while the German loss was 12 aircraft). Generally speaking, the scale of these wars is still very small.

However, the war in Northern Europe is completely different. The outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish War was almost three months later than the Anglo-French war against Germany, but the intensity of the war is obviously unmatched by the Western Front. Because the Soviet Union's military strength is stronger than Finland's, it did not mobilize after the outbreak of the war, and almost entirely deployed the local forces of the Leningrad Military District and Soviet Karelia to combat. Also, because northern Finland is entirely within the Arctic Circle, the climate is very cold, daylight hours are only four or five hours, and the terrain is rugged, with lakes and forests crisscrossing, which is very unfavorable for the offensive, so the development of the war is relatively slow. According to war news, the Soviet Union's advance is divided into three routes: north, south, and central. The southern route is mainly attacking the main buffer of Finland's Mannerheim Line, while the main offensive is in northern and central Finland. Obviously, the Soviet Union is attempting to break into Finland from the center, dividing the entire country into two halves, north and south, in order to cut off the transportation line through Sweden and Norway for Britain, France, and the United States to aid Finland.

Because the Western Front war is quiet, because Britain and France are paying close attention to the Finnish issue and are doing their best to provide spiritual and material assistance to Finland, and because of the League of Nations' expulsion of the Soviet Union and the strong anti-Soviet atmosphere in Europe, many people have this question: Will the war between Britain and France and Germany in Western Europe turn into an anti-Soviet war?

This question is very difficult to answer definitively. Needless to say, Britain and France both have this attempt. The quietness of the Western Front war, and the use of economic blockade as the main mode of combat, may be that the British and French authorities want to buy time to develop her war potential (Warpoential) and at the same time attempt to subdue Hitler with economic pressure, causing him to abandon the attempt to fight Britain and France, thereby turning the 'civil war' of capitalist countries into a unanimous anti-Soviet war. However, although Britain and France both have this attempt, and the anti-Soviet atmosphere in Europe is very tense, the current actual situation is very different from that in 1918 (that is, three and a half years after the outbreak of World War I). First of all, the Soviet Union is no longer the Tsarist Russia of that time. She has a strong national defense force and is not a country that has been consumed for a long time and defeated. Secondly, the internal contradictions of the belligerent countries in Western Europe have not yet been properly resolved, and it is unlikely that all the participating countries (including the Allied countries and the Allied Powers) will unanimously carry out armed intervention against the Soviet Union as in 1918. Third, the class contradictions within the belligerent countries are similar to those after World War I. The anti-war and anti-fascist movements have risen higher than before, and have a deeper root in the masses, making the ruling authorities of various countries dare not openly challenge the Soviet Union before they have thoroughly suppressed them (such as the recent arrest of Communist Party members in France). Finally, the colonial territories of Britain and France in various parts of the world, as well as the Czech Republic, Austria, Poland, and other countries occupied by Germany, may erupt in national independence and liberation movements, and those already in progress, such as the Chinese war of resistance against Japan and the Indian independence movement, are all things that Britain and France must take into account before waging an anti-Soviet war. Therefore, they are currently weakening or destroying these struggles, and when their destructive work is not very effective, this anti-Soviet war will not be easy to achieve for a while.

### Byrd, the Second Columbus in the World, Is Now on His Way to Antarctica

— Chen

Admiral Byrd of the United States Navy, a friend of President Roosevelt, set sail on the North Star from Boston a month ago (November 15th of last year) for his third trip to Antarctica. He arrived in Wellington on December 18th, and it has been more than ten days now. I think he has safely arrived in the icy and snowy land.

Funding for the Third Expedition

The previous two expeditions discovered 450,000 square miles of new land. This second trip to Antarctica has a budget of one million US dollars. In addition to the US government providing him with 340,000 US dollars and the North Star ship with many scientific experts, the rest is raised by Byrd himself. Originally, he was good at speaking. He traveled around lecturing about his previous experiences in Antarctica. From 1935 to 1936, he earned 190,000 US dollars in one year. The income from his books is also considerable. Currently, only five books have been published, and the sales have totaled more than one million US dollars. After deducting the expenses of the assistant editors, Byrd's net income is 130,000 US dollars in royalties. During his first expedition, the New York Times gave him 150,000 US dollars to buy his news reports. During his second expedition, Krapp Nats paid 145,000 US dollars to buy the broadcasting rights of his situation in Antarctica.

Byrd's Family and Biography

Everyone knows a little about the situation in Antarctica. There are nine months of long nights in a year, and the cold is ninety degrees below freezing. People think that an explorer who can endure this extreme climate must be a figure with a strong body and dark skin, but strangely, Byrd is just like our ancient Zhang Liang, with a feminine appearance. Because of this, although his hair is a bit white, he doesn't look very old. He was born in 1888 in Winchester, and his father was a lawyer, who has now passed away. His mother is seventy years old this year. He has three brothers, a wife and five children. He was originally in the Navy. Once, in the Caribbean Sea, which is inhabited by sharks, he rescued a drowning person and received a medal. In 1916, he retired from the military due to a foot injury. In 1917, the United States joined the war, and he put on his military uniform again to serve the country.

The work of exploration is not only terrible because of ice and frostbite, but also because of poverty. People who have explored the North and South Poles in the past have ended up with nothing. Byrd has become a wealthy man, so he has encouraged many future explorers; and hinted to investors that this is also an excellent business. Since the death of Amundsen in 1928, Americans have recognized Byrd as the world's foremost explorer.

### Measurement of Price Fluctuations

— Guan Qing

How do we measure the rise and fall of prices? Then we have to use the "Price Index" (ＩndexＮumberofＰrice). The price index is the average of general price fluctuations. The method of calculating the price index is as follows:

Take the average price of various specified goods in a specified period as the base price, and assume it to be one hundred; then compare the average index of each item thereafter with the index representing the base price, and find the percentage of its rise and fall. For example, last year, rice was two yuan per dou, briquettes were fifty cents per basket, cloth was twenty cents per foot, meat was thirty cents per catty, and vegetables were fifty wen per catty; this year, rice is three yuan per dou, briquettes are one yuan per basket, cloth is thirty cents per foot, meat is fifty cents per catty, and vegetables are eighty wen per catty. If the index of last year is one hundred, then the index of this year is 150 for rice, 200 for briquettes, 150 for cloth, 150 for meat, and 160 for vegetables; if we calculate the index of this year based on the above prices, the formula is:

One hundred and eighty-two is the general price index for this year. Compared with one hundred last year, it is obvious that prices this year have increased by eighty-two percent compared to last year.

The above calculation method treats all kinds of goods as equally important, which we call the "light index". This calculation method is more difficult to see the actual rise and fall of prices and the impact on people's lives. For example, if rice rises by fifty percent and cloth falls by fifty percent, the average of the two is still equal to one hundred, as if there is no rise or fall; but in fact, a fifty percent rise in rice has a great impact on people's lives, and even if cloth falls by fifty percent, it cannot compensate for it. Therefore, countries use the "weighted index" method, and the calculation formula is as follows: (Assuming that the importance of rice and cloth is in the ratio of two and one, and the light index is one; then one rises by seventy-five percent, and one does not rise at all. From this, we can compare the uses of the two methods.

### Working Youth

— Du Yaosheng

The sweet life of childhood has just passed, followed by youth. Youth makes initial contact with the world, and everything feels new, but they feel disappointed by its darkness; because older people have experienced the world and seem to "enter a shop selling abalone, and after a long time, they don't smell its odor." Young people are not like this. Their feelings are particularly keen and rich, so the term "youthful depression" is almost ubiquitous.

Young people have many problems, and working youth have even more problems. For example, students can bury their heads in their books and spend their years leisurely under the guidance of teachers. Working youth must have economic burdens. On the one hand, they still want to seek knowledge. You see, the development of supplementary schools in Shanghai is a clear proof. Under these circumstances where they have to plan for both study and work, working youth are particularly painful. Fortunately, since the War of Resistance, the rear has been in urgent need of talents. In the past, Ban Chao often threw his pen and sighed, "How can a great man spend a long time on writing?" Working youth who read this cannot help but have feelings.

### International Short News

— Ju

Since Litvinov resigned in May 1938, he disappeared for a long time, until November of last year, when his name appeared in the newspaper again. It is said that this was due to Kalinin's intercession. Before being appointed to a new position, Litvinov temporarily assisted Molotov in handling foreign affairs.

Before the war, German Economic Minister Dr. Funk returned to two South American republics to order raw materials worth 20 million gold pounds, but this has now been cancelled because it is impossible to ship them.

The King of Italy has been more active behind the scenes in the political arena recently, and Mussolini has been able to cooperate closely. Mussolini's frictions with the King of Italy in the past have now been reduced.

Two years ago, seven German communists were arrested and convicted for stealing German new-style submarine manufacturing technology for the Russians. Last year, German naval experts automatically sent the design to Soviet Russia. It is said that its engine was invented by the German Karl Lackner in 1937 and can absorb fuel in the water instead of gasoline.

Spain lacks agricultural machinery and will transform wartime tanks to replace them.

Germany and Yugoslavia are discussing the purchase of 50,000 pigs. It has also recently purchased a large amount of grain from Bulgaria to be used as pig feed.

In order to save material resources, Germany will repair unused and rusty small ships and operate them on the Danube River.

### Letter to the Editor

Dear Mr. Reporter: I recently read Mr. Fuyun's manuscript "General Situation of the Beggar Asylum" on January 7th and found that it is slightly inconsistent with the facts. I would like to make the following corrections: Because the newly admitted beggars are unruly, the management should take a slightly disciplined approach. However, it is not true that they are subjected to torture such as eating "fried Qin Hui" and "bamboo shoots roasted with meat." Also, they eat porridge and vegetables every morning and receive salted vegetables or red fermented bean curd once a day, not once every three or four days. I think Mr. Fuyun must have heard rumors and lost the truth. I am writing this letter to make corrections. Sincerely, The Beggar Asylum

### German Women's Marriage Advertisements

— Qing

German newspapers often publish such advertisements: "A young and beautiful woman, with a kind temperament and noble character, sincerely seeks a lifelong partner..." Such marriage advertisements are found in almost every newspaper. Sometimes, in addition to the young and beautiful woman, there are also additional gifts. Under the conditions of noble character and kind temperament, the father also runs a grocery store, and the inheritance can be inherited after the father's death. The mother runs a laundry, and the laundry can be managed after the mother's death. There are also descriptions of the amount of dowry, etc., which can be described as colorful. But one thing is that in the marriage advertisements, there is only a detailed description of the parents' property, but no description of their own profession. Why? Because women with occupations have to return to the mansion immediately after marriage.

Although these advertisements are posted in the advertising column, the effect is still zero. Because German men certainly love young and beautiful women, but they also know the difficulties of life. How will they deal with a wife's future life? Since additional gifts are added, if the father-in-law does not die, the grocery store is still someone else's, and the wife's living expenses must still be borne by themselves. Therefore, German men would rather find mistresses outside than marry a wife.
