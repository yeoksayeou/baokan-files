### Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation (Continued) February 17th to 23rd

Southern Fujian

After we recaptured Dongshan Island, several thousand Japanese and puppet troops landed near Gangwei on the 17th, attempting to invade Chengpu. After being surrounded and attacked by our troops on all sides, they were confined to the seaside without any progress. On the 19th and 20th, more than 3,000 puppet troops, with more than 2,700 guns, led by Regiment Commander Hu Laipu, Chen An□, Zhang Zhenglou, etc., defected and fought against the Japanese in the Dahu Mountain and Gangwei area. Our main force took the opportunity to directly attack their core positions. In recent days, more than a thousand enemies have been killed, and the remaining Japanese forces have been disintegrating. The Japanese attempt to invade Fujian has suffered a fatal blow.

Northern Hubei

Since the 18th, our army has launched a campaign to wipe out the Japanese troops entrenched in the strongholds northeast of the Dahong Mountains. After recovering Pingba, an important stronghold between Anzhong, Anjing, and Xiangyang, they took advantage of the victory to besiege Yujiadian and Luoyangdian. On the 19th, they continued to capture Dushan and Maping, and unexpectedly recovered Pinglin. Another unit of our army launched a fierce attack on Suixian, forcing it to the outskirts of the city. After suffering heavy losses, the Japanese were on the verge of collapse and were attempting to break out and escape.

Shandong Province

The Japanese troops harassing Wendeng and Rongcheng have not yet discovered the location of our main force, and have been trapped in the complex mountain valleys in that area. The Japanese forces are exhausted. Their independent mixed brigade commander, Akiyama Seitaro, was seriously injured and killed in the battle of Zhuwangzhuang. The Japanese forces are demoralized.

Western Hebei

The attack on the key point of Mentougou is still raging in the Xishan area.

Northern Henan

Our army once rushed into Boai on the 17th, killing several hundred Japanese.

Southern Shanxi

The stubborn Japanese troops in various places are still under our fierce attack. Two strongholds on the periphery of Jiang County have been recaptured.

Anhui Border

The Japanese troops who launched attacks in three directions from Wuhu, Wanzhi, and other places on the 19th were bravely blocked between Shuiyang and Langxi, killing many Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese forces have been shaken and are retreating towards Gaochun. All of the above are important battle achievements of the past week and are worthy of special report.

### Weng Wenhao Discusses Economic Resistance

Chongqing – Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao gave a radio address here last night, mainly stating that the anti-Japanese war in the future must be carried out in two aspects: (1) increasing China's production, and (2) strengthening the blockade of the Japanese economy. Weng stated that the most important thing for China at present is to increase the production of military supplies, ammunition, grain, clothing, and other materials needed by the soldiers on the front lines. On the other hand, because China's heavy industry has not established a foundation in the past, China must increase the export of tea, silk, tung oil, bristles, wool, minerals, and other products in order to obtain foreign exchange to purchase military supplies and other raw materials. On the other hand, it is necessary to increase the manufacture of daily necessities in order to stabilize prices in the rear. At the same time, people should also be accustomed to diligence and thrift. All three of these are intended to increase production. In addition to this, the economic blockade of Japan should be strengthened. All goods produced by Japan and its colonies, as well as factories outside the Japanese mainland, and goods seized by the Japanese, are subject to boycott and rejection. Finally, the Chinese should stop supplying raw materials to Japan. Farmers and young people near the Japanese defense lines must refuse to work for the Japanese. (25th United Press Dispatch)

### Government Actively Developing Xinjiang's Rich Resources

Chongqing – Xinjiang and the mainland of China are now connected by new air routes and highways. The central government is now taking strong action to develop the natural resources of this province, which was once almost a forbidden area, and has already invested 750,000 yuan in a certain gold mine in Xinjiang. The mine currently produces 15,000 ounces of gold per year. It is reported that Xinjiang previously only produced 20,000 tons of coal per year, but the central government has already invested 300,000 yuan to develop the coalfields west of Turpan and Kashgar in the province. Xinjiang's true future lies in agriculture and animal husbandry. Therefore, the central government has spent 40 million yuan to establish model agricultural stations. In the field of animal husbandry alone, the government's investment has exceeded 20 million yuan. The Xinjiang Provincial Government spent approximately 500,000 yuan on irrigation and water conservancy projects last year, and will allocate another 500,000 yuan this year. Seven years ago, only 2,000 people in the province had received elementary education. But today, due to the implementation of group education, 200,000 men and women have received education at all levels, and the province's education and culture budget has now increased to more than 4 million yuan per year.

Editorial

### The Unfolding of the Struggle for Neutral Countries

Although the European war is currently superficially in a state of semi-pause, the two sides' struggle to win over neutral countries as allies is extremely active in secret. In this European war, Northern Europe has neutral countries such as Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, Western Europe has two neutral countries, the Netherlands and Belgium, and Central Europe and the Balkans have neutral countries such as Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, Hungary, and Turkey. Regardless of whether these countries nominally maintain neutrality, but are actually more inclined to one side and estranged from the other; regardless of whether both sides of the belligerent countries declare that they will not violate the security of the neutral countries and respect their independence; when the war expands, the belligerent countries will probably only consider the situation of these small countries from a military, diplomatic, and strategic point of view, and will never lightly relax their grip because of their neutral legal principles or their unwillingness to join the war. The lessons of the last war have already proven that so-called neutrality only becomes an initial wish, and is not an unbreakable barrier. Germany's use of Belgium as a transit route in 1914, destroying Belgium's neutrality, is one of the most famous events. However, similar things have also happened on the other side. In 1915, the Allied forces landed in Thessaloniki and occupied Saloniki, as a base for the Allied forces to attack the Macedonian front; and aided Venizelos, overthrowing the Greek government that was unwilling to fight at that time, and Venizelos formed a government and joined the Allied forces in the war. From this, it can be seen that threats and inducements were used to the extreme, which had already created a prominent precedent in the last war. Since the outbreak of this war until today, the time has been short, and the war on the Western Front is not like the last war, where both sides, at the beginning, used rapid steps to seek a quick victory, so events that destroy the neutrality of countries have not been discovered so far. However, the fact that neutral countries' ships have been sunk by German submarines, and that belligerent countries' airplanes have invaded the borders of neutral countries, has been seen repeatedly. Although the neutral countries have protested, the belligerent countries often ignore them in eight or nine out of ten cases; at most, they express apologies, but never guarantee the future. Recently, the British warship's search of the German Altmark, with both forces acting within the territorial waters of a neutral country, Norway, although seriously protested; but the result is probably not that both sides will respect Norway's territorial waters from now on! Viewing Britain's response to Norway's protest, "not wanting to give a reply for the time being," is clear evidence. As the war develops, similar events are bound to become more and more numerous, and their relationship is bound to become more and more important. Beginning with inducement, followed by threats, and finally falling on one side and engaging in armed conflict with the other. From Northern Europe to the Balkans, these countries are still in a state of peace, but this kind of peace can only be regarded as superficial, temporary, and easily broken, because it has no strong guarantee whatsoever. The Netherlands and Belgium in Western Europe, in terms of strength, are not enemies of Germany, and in terms of situation, are between two great powers. Fortunately, these two countries have no territorial disputes in the past, and their relations have always been friendly, and they will not be used by other countries to fight each other. The three Nordic countries, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, are countries of the same race and language, with consistent interests and the same view of peace-loving. If there is an external crisis, the three countries will consult each other and deal with it together, so in their essence and subjectively, they must be like the Netherlands and Belgium, and will not be used by third countries, and have any biased actions. As for the Balkan countries, called neutral, the most complex in terms of ethnicity, the most burdensome in terms of disputes, and also the focus of attention for ambitious international adventurers. After the last war, this area became the battleground for the Versailles system versus the anti-Versailles system, and the grand stage for countries maintaining the status quo versus countries overthrowing the status quo. On the eve of the Second World War, due to the expansion of the National Socialist Party's power and the rapid advance of the eastward policy, the struggle between countries in the Balkans became more and more acute. Britain and France then provided guarantees for the integrity of Greece, Turkey, and Romania, and these three countries were happy to accept the guarantees. Now Romania seems to be showing some signs of wavering, but Greece, Turkey, and Romania will not participate in the war, but if they do, they must be allies of Britain and France. Not only that, but also because the Western Front is quiet, Britain and France currently do not want to break through Germany from the eastern border of France; but because Greece is in the hands of Britain and France, Turkey is closely linked with Britain and France, and Britain and France have stationed heavy troops in the Near East, their intentions can be imagined. Calling it a defense against the southward advance of the Soviet Union is actually unreasonable, because before the Soviet Union conquered Finland, how could the Soviet Union have any reason to advance southward? And Britain and France have repeatedly declared that the Soviet Union has stationed heavy troops in the Caucasus, and declared that Turkey has already mobilized. The trend that this reveals to us is: the development of the war in the future may not be on the Western Front, but will probably unfold from this link and develop towards another link. Once the war is launched, it cannot be stopped, and it cannot be cleaned up as desired. It is like playing with fire, the more you play with it, the more intense it becomes. At that time, wooing neutral countries, coercing neutral countries, and destroying the neutrality of countries will inevitably be like the situation in the last war, and will no longer be considered for any other reason than military strategy!

### The Complete Publication of Secret Documents Regarding the Lansing-Ishii Agreement; The United States Once Suggested Publishing an Open Door Declaration, But Japan Rejected It, Citing Special Interests

Washington – Secret documents regarding the negotiations between U.S. Secretary of State Lansing and Japanese Ambassador to the United States Ishii on the Chinese issue in 1917 have now been published here. The first volume is about the negotiations on the neutralization of China, which was published three days ago. But this suggestion was put forward too late and was rejected by President Wilson. The second volume was published today, which contains the Japanese Ambassador to the United States Ishii's proposal to discuss the Chinese issue with the United States. At that time, U.S. Secretary of State Lansing proposed that the United States and Japan jointly issue a declaration on the Open Door Policy. Ishii looked shocked and uneasy at Lansing's suggestion, and said that Japan has always adhered to the Open Door Policy, so it is considered unnecessary to issue this declaration, and Japan has special interests in China in terms of its position. Therefore, if only a declaration on the Open Door Policy is issued, without an accompanying statement on Japan's special interests, it will inevitably invite criticism and attacks in the country. (26th United Press Dispatch)

Washington – The U.S. Department of State published the documents of former U.S. Secretary of State Lansing yesterday. The second volume, which is also the last volume of Lansing's documents, was published this time. The documents contained in this volume mainly involve the Sino-Japanese negotiations during the previous European War, the U.S. sending troops to Siberia, and the U.S. cooperating with Britain and France in the plan and action to jointly resist Germany from April 1917 to November 1918. Lansing was the U.S. Secretary of State during the previous European War. The Lansing-Ishii Agreement, which was once the focus of world attention, was the agreement signed by Lansing on behalf of the United States and Japanese politician Ishii. (26th Haitong Dispatch)

### A Central Figure in Japanese Politics: Tatsuo Saitō's Brief Biography; "A Short Man with a Loud Voice"

Hong Kong – Tatsuo Saitō, who has become a central figure in Japanese politics, has been referred to as "a short man with a loud voice" by some Japanese newspapers. He is a well-known member of the Minseitō party. On February 2, he gave a speech in the House of Representatives, criticizing the Konoe statement, which is considered sacred throughout the country, shocking the entire audience. His background is worth noting. It is reported that Tatsuo Saitō is 71 years old this year. He is from Kansai and is only five feet tall and weighs less than one hundred pounds. When he spoke to reporters about this incident, he was full of indignation. He likes archery and often sings Japanese songs. He gets up very early every day, browses the newspapers, and then handles daily public and private affairs. He always goes to the Japanese Club for lunch and rarely goes out after evening. Although he is old, he is still as healthy as ever and does not look like a 71-year-old. He usually wears a kimono and often takes walks in the countryside. He knows nothing about Japanese art and has no interest in it. He is never seen in the Japanese opera house. He speaks English, but still prefers to use Japanese in his daily life. He studied in the United States and worked as a lawyer after returning to China. He began his political career in 1912. In 1913, he was the representative of Japan to a certain international conference in the Netherlands. In 1919, he was the representative of a certain international conference in this capital. He has traveled all over Russia, Germany, France, Italy, Britain, and Switzerland. (26th Dispatch)

### The Philippines Expected to Become Independent as Scheduled; Sayre Explains Reasons

Manila – U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre stated today on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Manila Daily Bulletin that he believes that unless there is a drastic change in the international situation, the Philippine Independence Act will be implemented as scheduled. There are two reasons: (1) He does not believe that Americans and Filipinos will make any further changes to this act. (2) Under the current international situation, American taxpayers do not seem likely to support the proposal to build and maintain sufficient defense forces in the Philippines. Regarding the economic difficulties that should arise after the independence of the Philippine Islands, the Filipinos have already been aware of them when they accepted the Tydings–McDuffie Act. A reporter asked whether the Japanese invasion would cause the Filipinos to change their desire for independence. Sayre replied, "Of course, no one can predict what will happen in the future. The world in 1946 may be very different from the world today. What I am saying today may be completely unfounded at that time. But unless there is a major change in the world situation, the Filipinos' desire for independence is unlikely to change much." (26th United Press Dispatch)

Vatican City - Myron Taylor, the personal representative of U.S. President Roosevelt to the Vatican, has arrived in Rome. The Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Maglione, immediately sent two representatives to pay their respects. Taylor is scheduled to meet with Cardinal Maglione tomorrow, at which time the date of his audience with the Pope may be confirmed. Observers here have said that the United States severed diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1867. Taylor's arrival is not a formal resumption of relations, as he is only President Roosevelt's personal representative and not the formal representative of the U.S. head of state. Therefore, his mission is limited. However, the Vatican is treating him as an ambassador and recognizes his diplomatic privileges. People in the Vatican are very satisfied with Taylor's visit, which is the real situation. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)

Rome - According to well-informed Vatican sources, Pope Pius XII will receive Welles on the 28th.

### Details of Japanese Army and Navy Expansion; Diet Unable to Intervene in Funding

### Meeting of Foreign Ministers of Three Nordic Countries; Decide to Maintain Strict Neutrality; Hope for Peaceful Resolution of Soviet-Finnish War; Seriously Protest Anglo-German Naval Warfare Methods

Copenhagen - The foreign ministers of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden recently held a meeting here to review the international situation. Afterwards, a public statement was issued stating that the results of the meeting have been telegraphed to the foreign minister of Finland and the prime minister of Iceland for their information. (Note: Iceland and Denmark are in a personal union). At this meeting, the foreign ministers of the three Scandinavian countries expressed their hope that the war between Finland and the Soviet Union could be resolved peacefully, allowing Finland to maintain complete independence and sovereignty; this is the first point. The three foreign ministers reiterated their neutral policy, denying that their current attitude is due to pressure from any party, and declared that in their foreign relations, they have decided to pursue an independent, autonomous, impartial policy. At the same time, they also decided to demand that the belligerent countries respect the territories and territorial waters of neutral countries in accordance with international law; this is the second point. The neutral countries are eager to maintain necessary and legitimate overseas trade, but current naval warfare has caused significant losses to these countries. The three foreign ministers have decided to lodge a serious protest and seek remedies for naval warfare methods that violate the principles of international law. In this regard, the three governments will support each other when negotiating with the belligerent countries; this is the third point. The three foreign ministers believe that if the current European war is not ended early, it will inevitably lead to greater disasters. Not only will the mutual relations between countries worsen, but it will also be more difficult to find a lasting solution. For this reason, any effort that can promote negotiations between the belligerent countries to establish a fair and lasting peace is welcomed by the three countries; this is the fourth point. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)

Copenhagen - The public statement issued after the meeting of the foreign ministers of the three Scandinavian countries has been commented on by political figures. It is generally said that the three Scandinavian countries deeply hope that Finland and the Soviet Union can find a fair and lasting solution to the current dispute. If Germany can come forward to mediate and maintain Finland's independence, it would be welcomed by the three Scandinavian countries. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)

London - The Daily Express reported that the meeting of the foreign ministers of the three Scandinavian countries has accepted the proposal of Danish Foreign Minister Munch and decided to jointly mediate the war between Finland and the Soviet Union and try to protect Finland's freedom and independence. However, if a basis for mediation cannot be found, they will request Hitler to mediate. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 26th)

Copenhagen - The foreign ministers of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden began their meeting yesterday afternoon. After the three foreign ministers had a small banquet together, they were summoned by Danish King Christian. After that, the advisors of the three foreign ministers began to hold a plenary meeting at Christiansborg Palace. Before attending the meeting, Danish Foreign Minister Munch told people that only a general agenda was prepared and there were no special points. It is expected that Swedish Foreign Minister Gunther and Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht will return to their respective capitals tonight. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)

### French Newspaper Advocates Attacking the Soviet Union

Beijing - The Paris newspaper "Le Temps," a mouthpiece for the French Foreign Ministry, openly advocated attacking the Soviet Union yesterday, with British and French forces attacking the Caucasus border. The newspaper criticized Allied newspapers for reporting on Soviet attacks along that line, saying that the Soviet Union would not attempt such a thing. The newspaper stated that the Allied plan to blockade Germany would fail completely because Germany was using Soviet resources. Finland's resistance against the Soviet Union could make the Allied blockade of Germany more effective. To prevent the transport of Caucasian oil and Ukrainian grain, British and French forces should exploit the Soviet Union's weaknesses and attack in the Black Sea and Caucasus regions.

### Altmark Incident: Norway Replies to British Note; States it has Fulfilled all International Responsibilities; Willing to Submit Disagreements to Arbitration; Britain Denies Sending Aircraft to Search for German Ship

London - Norwegian Minister to Britain Colban visited Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday afternoon and handed him a note regarding the "Altmark" incident, taking the opportunity to answer several questions raised by the Foreign Secretary on the 17th of this month. According to diplomatic sources, the Norwegian note has been carefully studied by the Foreign Office. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)

Oslo - The government has instructed Minister to Britain Colban to deliver a note to British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, which first describes the circumstances of the German auxiliary ship "Altmark" being intercepted in Norwegian territorial waters, and states that although the ship was equipped with several small anti-aircraft guns for self-defense, they had been unloaded before entering Norwegian territorial waters. The captain of the Norwegian torpedo boat asked the German ship's captain if the ship was carrying people from other belligerent countries, and was told no. Furthermore, the ship did not initially enter the port of Bergen, as Prime Minister Chamberlain believed, so the 24-hour limit for berthing did not apply. As for its navigation in Norwegian territorial waters, no treaty or neutrality regulation initially stipulates a 24-hour limit. All of these points are undoubtedly true. Even when the British government sent a letter to the Norwegian government on May 23 last year, it firmly asserted that warships of all countries should have the right to pass through the territorial waters of neutral countries. In short, the Norwegian government has made every effort to fulfill all international responsibilities under any circumstances. As for the British government's eagerness to rescue its prisoners, the Norwegian government understands this, but all actions must be based on the actual provisions of existing treaties, which is something it cannot help. If the British government still insists on its original views, the Norwegian government is willing to submit the differences between the two sides to arbitration, the method of which can be jointly determined by the two governments. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)

Oslo - Regarding the "Altmark" incident, London political figures have indicated that the British government is likely to oppose arbitration and advocate direct negotiations between Britain and Norway. (Haitong dispatch on the 26th)

Oslo - The government has officially announced that British Minister Sir Dormer presented a note to the Foreign Ministry on the 20th of this month, reiterating the statement made by Foreign Secretary Halifax to our Minister to Britain Colban on the 17th of this month, stating that the British government believes that the Norwegian authorities failed to thoroughly inspect the German ship "Altmark," resulting in the failure to discover British prisoners, which was a failure to fulfill the duties of a neutral country. Therefore, all information regarding the inspection process and the various facts after the inspection should be provided by Norway. The government has now instructed Minister Colban to reply to the British government. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)

London - The Air Ministry has issued a public statement stating that foreign sources have reported that three British aircraft flew to Jossingfjord in Norway on the afternoon of this month to search for the German auxiliary ship "Altmark" and other German ships. This statement is completely unfounded. No British aircraft have performed this task. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)

London - Under-Secretary Butler said in the House of Commons today, in response to a question about the extent of Norwegian territorial waters, that due to the special shape of the Norwegian coastline, the delimitation of its territorial waters is now a matter of discussion. This issue cannot be said to have been finally decided. Although the Norwegian government has not abandoned its claim of a four-mile limit, it has informed the British government that it cannot maintain the three-mile neutrality clause beyond the coast in the current war. Butler also answered various supplementary questions, stating that Norwegian territorial waters have been greatly extended due to the existence of islands. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)

The Hague - After arriving in the Netherlands, the German economic delegation began talks with Dutch authorities in The Hague this morning to discuss promoting trade between the two countries. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)

### Britain and France Increase Troops in the Near East; Italy Deeply Troubled; Italian Possessions in Africa Directly Threatened; German Espionage Activities Also Struck

Rome - There are rumors that the Soviet Union is putting pressure on the Iranian government, while Britain and France are conducting military preparations in the Near East. Foreign observers here have said that the Italian authorities are extremely troubled upon hearing this, as Italy is very eager to maintain peace in the Near East. However, if the Soviet Union extends its influence along the Persian Gulf and constantly incites unrest in that area by sending personnel, the danger would be significant; this is the first point. This Soviet plan is actually being encouraged by Germany. If Britain and France want to resist, their power in the Near East will be strengthened accordingly, and the proposal to form a group of Muslim countries under the leadership of Britain and France will also be facilitated. As a result, traffic between Italy and its African possessions will inevitably be controlled by Britain; this is the second point. Regarding this matter, some Italian figures have already expressed their dissatisfaction with Britain's self-proclaimed role as guardian of Muslim countries. They also regard the concentration of troops by Britain and France near Italian Libya in North Africa as a direct threat to Italian possessions, which can be used as a weapon to pressure Italy when necessary, and are therefore even more dissatisfied. Some Italian commentators even believe that Britain and France's strategic position in the Mediterranean has been strengthened daily, which is enough to undermine the balance of power in the Mediterranean. This contradicts the commitment accepted by Britain in the Anglo-Italian Agreement (April 16, 1938), which is even less welcome to Italy. In short, Italian figures are extremely concerned about the situation in the Near East, and their close attention to the activities of the Soviet Union and Britain and France in that area goes without saying. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)

London - According to a special dispatch from here, the Swiss Tribune reported that "German spies are trying to incite the public in the Near East and Middle East against Britain, but without success. The arrival of Australian troops in Egypt is a surprising response to German espionage activities, and another clear confirmation of the error of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and others in predicting the disintegration of British countries." A newspaper in Budapest carried a news item entitled "The Construction Work of the British Empire in Arabia," which described the systematic work of Britain in deploying a network of bases along the Arabian border over the past twenty years, making the movement of the army under the command of General Weygand, commander of the Allied forces in the Near East, very convenient.

### "Breaking the Terrorism of World Financial Groups" is Germany's War Aim; German Newspapers Comment on Hitler's Speech

Berlin - Newspapers here have published the full text of Hitler's speech and issued comments, stating that Hitler has set "breaking the terrorism of world financial groups" as Germany's war aim. Newspapers said that Hitler's speech proved that he has absolute confidence in Germany's final victory. (Haitong dispatch on the 26th)

Berlin - Newspapers here commented on Chamberlain's recent speech, believing that his explanation of the causes and significance of the European war, and Britain's war aims, were all lies. Germany is determined to repel the attacks of British financial groups. The bravery and war aims of the German people are clear and beyond doubt. (Haitong Military dispatch on the 26th)

Rome - Italian newspapers published the speeches of Chamberlain and Hitler without editorial comment. People here now feel that discussions cannot affect the current situation. The most noteworthy thing now is whether neutral countries will be drawn into the war. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)

The Hague - Neutral observers in Berlin believe that Hitler's speech did not change the overall situation. A dispatch from Berlin in the Rotterdam newspaper stated that the main purpose of Hitler's speech was to strengthen the connection between Germany and its people and to maintain the courage of the people. A dispatch from Berlin in the Telegraaf newspaper stated that those hoping to hear words leading to peace would be disappointed by Hitler's speech. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)

London - According to a special dispatch today, the Memphis Commercial Appeal in the United States recently stated that the world should not worry that Germany is changing from Nazism to communism, because this change has already happened. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch stated that there is a rumor in economic circles that the Soviet oil obtained by Germany after the start of the war did not actually come from the Soviet Union's original oil wells, but from Soviet-occupied Poland, whose annual production is only 450,000 tons. The New York Times carried an article by Ms. McCormick stating that the feeling that Germany has been defeated is stronger in eastern Germany than in western Germany. It is strange that the countries most terrified by Germany have the least impression that Germany will win. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)

Swedish Capital - The Swedish Parliament passed the government's plan to control foreign exchange yesterday, which aims to ensure the import of important goods and overseas purchases needed for national defense. Only licensed merchants and special purposes are allowed to buy and sell foreign exchange. This plan is now being implemented immediately. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)

Swedish Capital - When the House of Representatives met this afternoon, Prime Minister Hansson delivered a speech, stating that our country's adoption of a neutral policy is not a sign of weakness. This is because our people have confidence in the government's national defense policy. As for the war between Finland and the Soviet Union, the government and the House of Representatives share the same views, but there are some differences in the views held by public opinion. In short, the government believes that it has protected the country's interests in the best possible way, and has also made every effort to help Finland within its capabilities. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 25th)

### Romanian Oil Supply Issue; British Government Discussing

London - Under-Secretary Butler stated in the House of Commons today that the Romanian oil supply issue is currently being discussed in all aspects. While this discussion is in progress, he will not comment on this issue. However, the British government does not currently want to view the situation as completely unsatisfactory. Labour MP Henderson asked whether it was true that the Romanian government was now motivated by pro-American sentiments. Butler replied that it was indeed the case. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)

### Finnish Foreign Minister's Statement: Ready to Negotiate with the Soviets, but Peace Cannot Compromise Security; Soviet Air Force Extensively Bombs Northern Finland

Helsinki - Finnish Foreign Minister Tanner, in an exclusive interview with the Associated Press yesterday, stated that Finland is ready to negotiate peace with the Soviet Union on an honorable basis. He solemnly declared that Finland's security and independence cannot be compromised for peace. "Finland is always ready to end the war peacefully, and we are still not opposed to friendly mediation, but it cannot jeopardize our security. If Finland had received the assistance a month ago as it does today, the Soviet invasion of Finland might not have made any progress." He expressed disappointment that the United States had not provided aid to Finland, believing that economic aid from the United States would be most appropriate. He solemnly declared that Finland is determined to resist the Soviet Union by force and has not received promises of foreign pressure or foreign aid. (Associated Press dispatch, 26th)

Helsinki - The Commander-in-Chief's military headquarters announced a battle report stating: (1) Yesterday, the Red Army launched attacks on our army's positions in certain areas, all of which failed. Our artillery units shattered several Red Army formations and destroyed seventeen tanks. (2) In the northeastern area of Lake Ladoga, repeated Red Army attacks were repelled, with two tanks, twenty-seven machine guns, twenty light machine guns, and a large number of rifles abandoned. (3) In the Petsamo port area, a ten-man patrol repelled a force of one hundred and eighty Red Army soldiers on skis. (4) Soviet aircraft were quite active yesterday, conducting extensive bombing raids in various parts of our northern region. Military observers further explained that although Viipuri is currently in a critical situation, from a general strategic point of view, the port is not of utmost military importance. This is because the Finnish government has built a railway to the northwest of the port to connect inland transportation. This measure will greatly reduce the advantages the Soviet Union can gain after occupying the port. The Red Army suffered heavy losses in attacking the port. Whether it is worth paying such a heavy price is questionable. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

Viipuri's Barrier Has Been Breached

Helsinki - The latest Finnish war report admits that Finnish troops have abandoned Koivisto Island. It also states that the Finnish artillery units in that area are now shelling Soviet troops in the hinterland of Karelia. The enemy forces launched an attack in Salmenkaita, and after a full day of fighting, the Finnish troops repelled them and destroyed several tanks. Finnish aircraft engaged in reconnaissance and bombed enemy rear areas. Aerial combat was frequent in the battle zone. According to confirmed reports, five enemy aircraft were shot down, and the confirmation of two more is pending. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Helsinki - The city of Viipuri, which the Soviet Union intends to capture, has been almost completely destroyed by bombs and artillery fire. According to a visitor who recently returned from there, Viipuri has become a heap of rubble, and many places in the city are on fire. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Helsinki - After receiving reinforcements, Soviet troops launched a fierce attack on Viipuri last night. All the residents of the city have been evacuated. Soviet artillery units continue to bombard, and tanks are also assisting in the attack. Soviet troops have gradually gained a dominant position. Finnish sources have acknowledged that the fate of Viipuri, a key point on the right flank of the Mannerheim Line, is likely to be its fall. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 26th)

Helsinki - Fierce fighting is taking place in Viipuri today. Soviet troops are continuously shelling Finnish positions with artillery. Soviet aircraft are also dropping paratroopers behind Finnish lines. The paratroopers are equipped with complete armaments. According to received reports, Viipuri is still in Finnish hands, but only the Koivisto fortress has fallen. Near Suomussalmi, the Red Army, which had retreated to the border area several days ago, has launched a new offensive. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 26th)

Moscow - According to a communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, yesterday Soviet troops broke through the enemy's fortified zone in Karelia and immediately occupied twenty-eight fortifications, including eight strong forts. The enemy repeatedly attempted counterattacks, but all were repelled. There were no significant developments in other areas. The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy troops on all fronts with great success. In aerial combat, the Soviet Air Force also shot down ten enemy aircraft. (TASS dispatch, 26th)

Stockholm - The Soviet Union issued a message yesterday, forcefully stating that the Red Army had occupied the fortresses on the islands of Björkö, Illynyari, and Billholmen in the Gulf of Finland. Finnish authorities have firmly denied this, saying that the Red Army forces attacking these islands have been valiantly repelled by Finnish troops. Although Red Army troops landed on Koivisto Island in the Gulf of Finland, they did not capture the Björkö fortress. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

The Situation of the Mannerheim Line Deployment

Moscow Dispatch - The inside details of the Mannerheim Line, which is consuming thousands of Soviet soldiers daily, have recently been described by the "Pravda" magazine in an article by Red Army Regiment Commander Galin. It briefly stated that he read American newspapers and learned that Finland's Mannerheim Line includes three main defense lines: (1) the Karelian Isthmus, (2) the Helsinki area, and (3) the Viipuri area. Near Helsinki and Viipuri, fortresses are built along the coast to control the sea entrances. The defense line on the Karelian Isthmus is further divided into two parts: (1) from the Gulf of Finland to Lake Ladoga, crossing the isthmus, and (2) the central defense line. The first defense line runs parallel to the Soviet-Finnish border, with a depth of twelve kilometers, and is built with barbed wire obstacles, trenches, tank traps, and minefields. This line has a total of thirty-eight fortresses. The second defense line is even stronger and is the main defense line of the Finnish army. The fortresses on this line are all in a trapezoidal formation, with a depth of two kilometers to ten kilometers, and there are a total of one hundred and fifty fortresses, all equipped with multiple machine guns, barbed wire obstacles, and tank traps. The defense line in the Viipuri area includes the fortress line along the Saimaa to Antrea railway, coastal fortresses, and anti-aircraft gun emplacements. Eight fortresses have been built along the railway, with the ground for mounting heavy machine guns and cannons being eighty to one hundred centimeters thick, and its solidity can be imagined. The lakes and marshes of the Karelian Isthmus and the dense forests make it easy for Finnish troops to build fortress positions. From 1922 to 1939, Finland hired military experts from various European countries to assist in the design of this defense line. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 25th)

### German Aircraft Repeatedly Cross the Border; Netherlands Will Lodge a Strong Protest; Aircraft from Both Countries Briefly Engage in Air Combat over Northern Brabant Province, Netherlands

The Hague - The Government Information Bureau announced: "Our patrol aircraft encountered a German Messerschmitt aircraft at an altitude of 8,000 meters over the town of Oss in northern Brabant province this morning. It immediately opened fire with machine guns to drive it away. The German aircraft also returned fire and then flew towards Roussel in Belgium. Our authorities believe that the German aircraft's intrusion into our airspace and shooting at our patrol aircraft is a gross act of recklessness, and we will naturally lodge a strong protest with the German government. Another German aircraft flew over the town of Woerden in the province of Utrecht and was fired upon by local anti-aircraft units before escaping to the southwest. We will also lodge a protest with the German government regarding this matter." (Havas dispatch, 25th)

The people living in the area between the border and this new defense line have been notified that they must be prepared to evacuate within a few hours of receiving a warning if the German military headquarters deems it necessary. Danish political circles believe that the construction of this defense line indicates that the Germans have recognized the current border as a permanent decision. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

### Wartime Social Welfare; Talent Adjustment Association Established; Handling Applications for Job Selection Registration; Promulgating Measures for Travel Expense Loans

Xu Shiying, Chen Lifu, and others, in order to solve the problem of wartime social personnel coordination, so as to achieve the effect of making the best use of people's talents and things, and to strengthen the strength of the War of Resistance and nation-building, specially organized the Wartime Social Welfare Talent Adjustment Association. The general headquarters is located in Chongqing, and work branches are established in various places, hoping to recruit technical talents from all over the country as much as possible to meet the needs of the rear. For those with various talents, from the war zone to the rear, or from the rear to the war zone, who lack travel expenses, the association will provide loans. As for those who have special skills and are currently unemployed, after passing the review, there are unemployment relief loans. For unemployed youths who generally do not have specialized skills, there are also adjustment measures. In addition to passive introductions, they also select the most needed and simpler skills in society and provide short-term training. The following are the application requirements for job selection registration, the measures for travel expense loans, and the measures for talent recruitment:

Job Selection Registration

(1) All citizens of the Republic of China who possess special skills suitable for social needs, are currently unemployed, or intend to change jobs for legitimate reasons may apply to the association and its branches for job selection registration. (2) All applicants for registration should fill out two talent registration forms at the association's work station, submit proof of resume, and two recent 2.5-inch half-length photos. If an applicant cannot personally register at the association's work station due to circumstances, they may register by mail or entrust someone else to register on their behalf. The procedures for filling out the form and submitting documents are still the same as in the previous item. (3) When an applicant for registration performs the registration procedures, the association's work station should send staff to conduct an interview and record the main points for reference in introducing work. If necessary, a corresponding examination and investigation may be conducted. If the applicant has not personally performed the registration procedures, the aforementioned interview or examination may be held before the introduction of work. (4) If the association's work station believes that an applicant for registration needs to be trained, the association may notify them to go to the designated address to receive training. The aforementioned training refers to spiritual and technical training that is beneficial to the applicant's future employment. (5) If the association's work station believes that an applicant for registration does have special skills and is suitable for social needs, the association should immediately select work on its behalf within the possible scope and introduce employment.

### Continuing Warfare Around Kinmen: Chinese Troops Capture Pingtan, Puppet Troops Defect En Masse Awaiting Reorganization

Fuzhou Dispatch: After the recapture of Haitan Island (i.e., Pingtan County) in eastern Fujian by Chinese troops since New Year's Day, the remnants of the pirate Yu A'gao's forces, who had been entrenched on the island, fled to Nan Gan Tang, Dong Xi Yang Islands, still plotting to stir up trouble. Earlier this month, they gathered 700-800 men again, taking advantage of fierce artillery fire from Japanese warships, and forcibly landed on the southeastern coastal areas of the county. The stationed troops lured them deep inside, withdrawing the troops from the city. Part of them disguised as civilians was ambushed among the common people. The pirate gang advanced rapidly, occupying the county town. The troops, coordinating from inside and outside at night, launched a fierce pincer attack. Caught off guard, the pirates suffered heavy casualties and fled in panic, escaping into the sea. Among them, Yu Meihou, Lin Huiru, Yu Yunjuan, Wang Jianmin, Shi Shiqi, and Han Zhengqi, totaling over 500 people, defected due to the unfavorable situation, sailing from Dongyang Island to Pingtan awaiting reorganization. The remaining bandits entrenched in Nan Gan Tang will be suppressed by the troops stationed in Lianjiang County, who dispatched a team in mid-month to attack, killing over 80 men, capturing over 20 men, and seizing over 60 guns. The bandit forces are now exhausted and will soon be completely eliminated.

Chinese Troops Launch Cross-Sea Raid on Kinmen

Kinmen Island in southern Fujian has been occupied for two years. Patriotic people of the county organized the Kinmen Recovery and Save-Homeland Corps. On the evening of February 5th, the corps gathered dozens of brave men and crossed the sea by [redacted] to Kinmen. With swift and mobile tactics, they raided the puppet second district office in Shawei, capturing the former deputy chairman of the Kinmen puppet maintenance association and the current puppet second district chief and head of the Shawei puppet police station, Lang Shouchun, as well as a puppet sentry. They also distributed 2,000 copies of leaflets about the second raid on Kinmen. The Japanese troops in Kinmen were greatly panicked, announcing martial law and cutting off land and water transportation at night.

Puppet Troops Engage in Internal Strife, Resulting in Armed Conflict

Most of the Japanese troops in Xiamen have now been transferred to Guangdong to fight, and pirates from Haitan and Meizhou Islands have been transferred to garrison, reorganized into the "Peace and National Construction Army." One is under the command of Horinouchi, stationed in the old chamber of commerce on Zhongshan Road, and the other is under the command of Sato, stationed in the New World on Xiahe Road. Every day, groups of three to five go out gambling and whoring, entering and leaving civilian homes to intimidate and extort. Due to conflicts of interest, disputes and struggles often occur, accumulating mutual dislike. Chinese personnel took the opportunity to distribute small leaflets in the Fuyu Island and Xiahe Road areas, advising compatriots who were arrested and forced into the puppet army to wake up as soon as possible. The puppet troops stationed in the old chamber of commerce pointed out that these leaflets were distributed by the puppet soldiers stationed in the New World, surrounded the New World, and wanted to confiscate the weapons of Sato's troops. The two sides engaged in armed conflict, attacking each other for several hours, resulting in [number unclear] deaths and injuries. The Japanese side disarmed the [unclear] responsible puppet troops and handed them over to the Japanese Navy for investigation. The turmoil subsided.

Educational News

### Flexible Implementation of New Regulations for Hong Kong School Buildings: Authorities Dispatch Personnel to Investigate Schools, Improving According to New Regulations in Due Course

(Hong Kong Dispatch) The Hong Kong Bureau of Education recently promulgated new education regulations. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Workers Union believed that they were difficult to implement, so they requested the Education Secretary to delay their implementation. Now they have also submitted a memorial to the Governor of Hong Kong, making a strong request. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited Education Secretary Solicitor to inquire about the current steps and attitude of the education authorities in implementing the new regulations. According to Solicitor, the new education regulations promulgated by the Hong Kong government were originally scheduled to be implemented on January 1 this year. The Hong Kong Education Workers Union believed that the implementation of the new regulations would affect both teachers and students, so they sent representatives to see him, requesting amendments to the new regulations. However, he believed that the new regulations had just begun to be implemented, and no one could say before implementation whether they would benefit or harm teachers and students. The Education Bureau has specially approved two measures for flexible implementation of the new regulations: (1) Schools registered with the Bureau before January 1, 1940, will be investigated separately by personnel dispatched by the Bureau to determine the extent to which they meet the standards of the new regulations and ordered to improve according to the new regulations in due course. Investigators have already been dispatched to handle this work, but because there are many schools in Hong Kong, this investigation work will take a long time to complete. He believes that it will be completed within this year. (2) All schools registered with the Bureau after January 1, 1940, must comply with all the new regulations. The reporter then inquired about his personal opinion on the new regulations. He replied that the Hong Kong government's revision of the new education regulations was due to the fact that many of the rules in the education laws were not perfect. In order to improve education in Hong Kong and raise the standard of education, the new education regulations were specially revised. He believes that the most important elements of education are two: (1) the equipment of the school buildings and the hygiene inside the school buildings, and (2) the qualifications of teachers. The standards of Hong Kong schools vary widely, and it is difficult to estimate the number or average number that can meet the standards of the new regulations.

### Proposed Tax Increase by the Public Works Department Arouses Criticism from Chinese and Foreigners, General Facts Listed and Criticized, Citizen's Ability to Bear Not Considered

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that the Public Works Department announced this morning (26th) that it plans to increase the municipal general tax, special property tax, and land tax by 50 percent. Regarding this matter, the reporter recently inquired with general Chinese taxpayers, who believe that "the cost of living has already risen, and there is a tendency to rise even further. How can the Public Works Department expect them to pay even higher taxes?" The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession will not make an official criticism of this issue until a special meeting is held soon to study it closely.

HSBC Agrees to Lend Ten Million

Various parties are deeply concerned about the news that the Public Works Department plans to increase various taxes due to financial exhaustion. Yesterday, Mr. J.W. Morcher, the Finance Director of the Public Works Department, told people that the Public Works Department has obtained the permission of HSBC Bank in Shanghai to borrow money to make up for this budget deficit. This loan will be repaid with tax revenue after the tax increase plan is approved by the Western Taxpayers Annual Meeting. According to informed sources, the amount of HSBC Bank's loan to the Public Works Department is approximately ten million yuan. If this loan can be achieved, all budget deficits will be made up by adding a minimum of 50 percent to various surtaxes. Otherwise, the budget deficit of the Public Works Department will become even larger.

Paying Salaries in Pounds is Extremely Inappropriate

However, a certain leader of Chinese residents claimed that since the Public Works Department's income is all in local currency, it should not have hired so many foreigners who are paid in pounds from the beginning. Some foreigners should have been replaced by qualified Chinese a long time ago. Another major Chinese taxpayer raised the issue of the Public Works Department's orchestra, saying that the Chinese Taxpayers Association has repeatedly opposed maintaining this "luxury." Those who love old music can also be satisfied by listening to gramophone records.

How Can Salary Earners Bear It?

A certain major Chinese claimed that he understands that the Public Works Department's economic burden will be heavy next year, but the department should not forget one thing, that is, most of the taxpayers in Shanghai are Chinese with small salaries. They have already encountered a high cost of living, and now the municipal tax continues to increase, making prices even higher, so they will be unable to bear it. Even if the Public Works Department finds that increasing taxes is inevitable, an increase of 50 percent is still too much. It is better to increase it every six months.

Only Concerned with Income, Ignoring People's Livelihood

Most of the Chinese taxpayers the reporter met criticized the Public Works Department for spending more time discussing their own income and less time discussing taking strict actions to curb hoarding and profiteering. If the department lowers the cost of living, taxpayers will be able to cope with the increase in taxes more easily. Now, residents of the two concessions have been moving out one after another because of lower electricity fees and taxes outside the concessions.

Why Not Reclaim the Japanese-Occupied Areas?

The Public Works Department should adopt a more resolute attitude and demand the return of the Hongkou, Huishan, and Yangshupu areas from the Japanese Bureau, which may increase revenue. The Public Works Department does not collect taxes on certain types of taxes that can be levied, such as the unlimited issuance of permits to the Japanese military by the Shanghai Defense Army. The number of Japanese cars and trucks with defense army permits and those without permits at all is far greater than the total number of permits held by the British, American, and Italian defense armies. Some cars with defense army permits are used by people who have nothing to do with the Japanese defense army.

Foreign Merchants Have Different Opinions

As for the general opinion of major foreign merchants in Shanghai, they believe that the tax increase by the Public Works Department is inevitable and should have been increased several years ago. The Public Works Department and its finance department have taken stupid measures in the past few years. According to a certain foreign merchant, even if the taxes in Shanghai are increased, they may still be lower than those in other cities in the world. For example, property taxes in the UK can be as high as 100 percent, and the lowest is about 40 percent.

Superficial Prosperity, Many Impoverished

He believes that the newspapers in the city should support the Public Works Department. Some Chinese will of course oppose it, but they should understand the protection they receive in the Public Concession. Shanghai is superficially prosperous, surpassing any city in the world. The poor may account for a larger proportion, but there are quite a few who can afford to pay higher taxes.

Orchestra Expenses Can Be Greatly Reduced

Another merchant claimed that the Public Works Department has made major mistakes in its economic arrangements, such as never considering the exchange rate. Now that the department is increasing taxes, residents have no choice but to pay in order to obtain police and fire protection. However, there are one or two major expenses that do not seem absolutely necessary, such as the orchestra, which is the most inappropriate. The orchestra only performs for a small number of residents in a small theater in the French Concession, so he believes that the expenses of the orchestra should be reduced and transferred to the police department, which has a difficult task. The police department has now lost some excellent personnel, who have resigned due to low salaries.

### The Puppet Land Bureau's Enticement to Register Title Deeds Has Failed

The property title certificates of the people in the suburban areas of Shanghai were stored in safe places by the owners after the war. The so-called "Land Bureau" last year hoped to organize the land and entice the owners to submit their property title certificates in order to collect "land tax." After more than a year, because the people were unwilling to easily let go of the legal land practice certificates issued by the former Land Administration Bureau, it proved that the "Land Bureau's" scheme to entice them had failed. Since last winter, the "Bureau" has also attempted to entice foreign merchants to register their British title deeds, which were a type of real estate certificate held by foreign merchants in the former Qing Dynasty and existed in Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and Baoshan. After hearing the news, most foreign merchants ignored it. Although five or six British merchants have sent letters to the puppet "Bureau" declaring that they retain the property rights of their British title deeds, it is only a notification procedure. As of now, not a single foreign company has followed the wishes of the puppet "Bureau" and completed the so-called "reporting procedure." Therefore, the "Bureau's" second scheme, to entice foreign merchants to register their British title deeds and certificates, has also failed.

### Team Leader Xie Continues to Send Condolence Money

Regarding the case of the White Russians attacking citizens without cause in the Lone Army Camp, it is now known that one of the seriously injured citizens, Chen Jinyu, is still in the hospital and has not recovered, especially his head. According to the Lone Army Camp, it has received 40 yuan in consolation money from the Gancheng Academic Research Society, which has been distributed accordingly. In addition to the previous distribution of 10 yuan per person in consolation money, Team Leader Xie has now sent an additional 20 yuan each, as well as daily necessities such as homemade soap, socks, and towels.

### 日方改造蕰藻浜大橋

The Wusong Yunzaobang Bridge is one of the largest bridges on the Shanghai-Wusong route. In the spring of the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), the municipal government allocated 200,000 yuan for its reconstruction. Before its completion, the January 28th Incident occurred, and the 19th Route Army burned the bridge deck. Afterwards, the Public Works Bureau made makeshift repairs, focusing only on resurfacing the bridge. During the August 13th Incident, the bridge was damaged a second time. Recently, the Japanese are converting Yunzaobang into a commercial port, expanding its width to 60 zhang (approximately 200 meters). Therefore, the Japanese have designed a reconstruction style for the bridge similar to the Waibaidu Bridge. The construction is being undertaken by units sent by the Army. The project is quite large and will take more than three years to complete.

### 舉辦健康比賽同鄉組遊藝大會

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Hometown Group Fundraising Committee will hold a variety show at the New World starting March 9th. In addition to adding various performances, a children's health competition and a "Longevity and Happiness" event for the elderly will also be held. The intention is profound. Detailed rules have been established and registration has begun. Children aged two to twelve, regardless of gender, can participate. The entire group of doctors from the Relief Association's health team will be responsible for the examination.

### 法總領昨特聲明謠傳貢米禁運來滬　越督正式否認

French Consul General to Shanghai, Mr. Baudic, specifically stated yesterday that the Governor-General of Annam officially denies the recent rumors in the rice market that the Annam authorities have prohibited the shipment of Saigon rice to China. Since January 1st of this year, 55,000 tons of Saigon rice have been specially permitted to be shipped to Shanghai. Furthermore, the approval is continuing to be issued without obstruction.

米價回跌

Rice prices fall back

Rice speculators spread rumors in the market, falsely claiming that French Annam would ban rice exports, in an attempt to raise rice prices. After French Consul General Baudic's statement was published, the rumors in the market ceased. The rice merchants have no means to implement their tricks. As a result, yesterday's rice market, for both domestic and foreign rice, fell back by one or two yuan. It is also known that a large amount of Saigon foreign rice has already been loaded onto ships on February 1st and will arrive in Shanghai soon.

請給外滙

Please give foreign exchange

The People's Food Regulation Association is carrying out price controls to help the poor. Due to limitations in donations and costs, the goal has not been achieved. The 15th, 36th, and 37th district branches of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Association jointly sent a letter to the People's Food Regulation Association yesterday, stating that the food problem is severe and the situation is worse than before, with crises lurking everywhere. They implore the authorities to follow the previous example and grant a legal foreign exchange rate for the purchase of foreign rice for price controls in the city to alleviate the suffering of the poor and suppress rising prices.

施振擴展

Expand relief efforts

The Charity Federation has been distributing steamed buns and soup since yesterday. A new location has been designated at the open space behind the Jade Buddha Temple at the intersection of Ma Bai Road and Gordon Road. It was distributed simultaneously with Dahua Road starting at 4 pm yesterday. It was found that the area is densely populated with poor people, so the number of people waiting for relief was exceptionally crowded, totaling no less than 5,000 people. In addition, the Buddhist Fellowship of this port has achieved good results since the establishment of issuing porridge tickets. The association has recently printed a large number of porridge tickets for all sectors to distribute, at 20 tickets per yuan, in units of two yuan. The recipients of the tickets distribute them themselves, or they can entrust the association to distribute them on their behalf, which is very effective.

### 日方意向迄未明瞭工部局及各界重視郵政總局大廈　被圈入警戒區

The intention of the Japanese side is still unclear. The Municipal Council and all sectors attach importance to the Post Office Building being encircled in the restricted area.

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Hongkou area has been temporarily administered by the Japanese army. Chinese people entering and exiting must not only have a "pass," but are also subject to searches from time to time. Those wishing to go to the Post Office Administration at the Sichuan Road bridgehead can enter and exit through the side door of the bureau on North Suzhou Road, which is considered convenient. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 24th of this month, the Japanese suddenly set up barbed wire fences on the east side of the North Suzhou Road Waterworks Bridgehead in the name of the "Concession Forces Command," blocking vehicles and erecting a wooden sign stating that it was necessary to enter and exit from the Sichuan Road Bridge and Wenjianshi Road. Although the barbed wire fence on the west side of the Sichuan Road Bridgehead was removed at the same time, the main entrance of the post office has not yet been opened.

進出麻煩

Inconvenient entry and exit

Since then, people from all walks of life who go to the Post Office Administration have to go around, and Japanese soldiers conduct inspections from time to time, which is twice as troublesome. Many have switched to sending and receiving mail through branch offices. The entire staff of the post office is also uneasy. Postmaster Zha Peilin has telegraphed the Kunming Post Office Administration for instructions, as this move actually encircles the Post Office Administration within the Hongkou restricted area, causing great inconvenience to the public.

意向不明

Unclear intention

Zha Peilin inquired with the Municipal Council about the Japanese side's special actions, but the intention of the Japanese side was still unclear. Zha later sent the Japanese Deputy Postmaster Kinzashi Kinichiro to negotiate with the Japanese consulate and relevant parties at 2 pm yesterday, but has not yet received a reply. The Municipal Council also attaches great importance to this matter. A reporter from Datong News Agency visited the bureau at noon yesterday and found that the number of people in the business office on the second floor who were mailing letters and handling other postal matters had decreased significantly. The number of packages waiting to be sent at the parcel delivery office on the first floor was even more sparse. The public is inconvenienced in their travels, which indirectly affects the business of the post office. Therefore, the outside world is very concerned about this incident.

### 加緊宵禁滬西意軍防區

The Italian army defense zone in western Shanghai tightens the curfew.

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council and the puppet government signed the temporary police power agreement for the road construction beyond the boundaries in western Shanghai, the Municipal Council Police Department has especially strengthened the police force in the area. The Italian defense forces under the jurisdiction of the district suddenly tightened the curfew starting the night before last. After 00:30, several patrol teams, each with about 20 people, were dispatched to areas such as Robert Road, Jiaozhou Road, Singapore Road, Caojiadu, Bailinan Road, and Jessfield Road, taking turns patrolling until 9:00 the next morning. Any suspicious pedestrians were taken to the Italian barracks opposite Jiaozhou Park. It is said that this action by the Italian soldiers is nothing more than to curb illegal activities in order to maintain law and order in the defense zone.

### 安南煤屑全從海防運來運費高昂影響煤球成本市商會函工部局　商減煤屑運費

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Municipal Council to discuss reducing the freight of coal dust. All the coal dust from Annam is transported from Haiphong, and the high freight rate affects the cost of coal briquettes.

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly consulted with the Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association to lower the market price of coal briquettes. It has notified all coal briquette factories to produce as much as possible, in the hope that there will be a surplus of coal briquettes and that supply and demand can be balanced. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, for the sake of a fundamental solution, specifically sent a letter to the Public Concession Municipal Council. The original letter stated, "Regarding the rising price of coal briquettes in the city, which has caused panic among residents regarding fuel, this chamber has repeatedly discussed with the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association and requested that they instruct all coal briquette factories to produce as much as possible and lower the selling price. However, the coal dust required for coal briquettes in this city is entirely supplied by French Annam coal mines, about 1,000 tons per day and 30,000 tons per month, all transported from Haiphong. The current high shipping costs affect the production cost of coal briquettes, which is a real obstacle to stabilizing the selling price of coal briquettes. After consultation with the industry, this chamber believes that the only way to solve the problem is to write to your council, requesting that it convene various shipping companies on a regular basis to discuss how to reduce shipping costs so that coal briquette factories can produce as much as possible and sell at a low price. This would be very fortunate. This matter is for the sake of stabilizing the lives of citizens, so please help as much as possible to achieve it. This is addressed to you."

煤業今日集議辦法

Meiye’s collective discussion method today

After the Coal Briquette Industry Association announced that all owners of coal briquette vouchers must clear their goods within ten days, all voucher holders went to various coal briquette factories to pick up their goods. However, the coal briquette factories shirked their responsibilities in every possible way, so the voucher holders could not pick up their goods. They sent representatives the day before yesterday to the Coal Industry Association to request that they contact the Coal Briquette Industry Association and notify all manufacturers to deliver the goods as agreed. The association decided to wait for a meeting to discuss the matter in detail. It is now known that the Coal Industry Association has scheduled a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees for 3 pm today at the association's office on Tianjin Road. It is said that in addition to discussing the above issues at that time, the meeting will also discuss the methods for stabilizing fuel in Shanghai.

廿五煤球廠生產量

Twenty-five coal briquette factory production volumes

Since the Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association began to investigate the production volume of each factory during the fixed price period, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency recorded their production volume on February 25 as follows: (1) Yi Tai Xing 341.40 tons, (2) Nanyang First Factory 117.30 tons, (3) Nanyang Second Factory 189 tons, (4) Guohua 161.625 tons, (5) Dongfang 135.50 tons, (6) Jinghua 59.26 tons, (7) Guanghua 58.125 tons, (8) Yuedong 27.50 tons, (9) Yuanhua 12 tons, (10) Beiyang 14.675 tons, (11) Hu Licheng 15 tons, (12) Huacheng Cuiji 15.50 tons, (13) Nanhua 3 tons, (14) Heji temporarily suspended, (15) Nanfang Changji 16.725 tons, (16) Gongyong 10 tons, (17) Gongping 1.40 tons, (18) Yanyan 3 tons, (19) Wufu temporarily suspended, (20) Xin Ping An Ji 2.5 tons, totaling 1181.51 tons.

### 酒業堅決反對組織酒行市塲　菸酒本有特稅雖無統制之名早有統制之實何必再設市塲

The liquor industry firmly opposes the organization of the liquor market. Although tobacco and alcohol are subject to special taxes and there is no name for control, there is already control in reality. Why set up a market again?

The 43 industry members of the Shanghai Liang Shaojiu Industry Association, in order to oppose the plan to form a liquor market, held a temporary industry meeting at Yile Dog Liang Shaojiu tea house on Nanjing Road at 3 pm the day before yesterday to discuss countermeasures.

Refuse to participate in the market and urge industry members to pay close attention. For the sake of caution, the association specifically issued a "Public Announcement by All Industry Members Opposing the Plan to Form a Liquor Market in an Attempt to Control It." The transcript is as follows: "Recently, someone or other has been using a stamp similar to the liquor industry, stamping blank presentation paper, and taking it to various shops, saying they want to apply for the organization of a liquor market.

Demanding that people stamp as such for control of liquor, or in the future, they will not be able to distribute goods. Threats and enticements, nothing is too extreme. Those who have not been to each shop are also notified by phone. There are two or three who do not understand the situation and are simple-minded, and have been tricked into stamping it. However, our entire 40+ families are not to be influenced by one or two people. Tobacco and alcohol are subject to special taxes, and although there is no name for control, there is already control in reality. Why set up a market again to engage in control? Examining their intentions, it is nothing more than wanting to collect commissions and raise market prices, so as to profit from it. Even selling out the entire industry will not stop them. Moreover, local shaojiu is among the most complex and fragmented of liquors. It is also needed by the lower and middle classes of society. In the past, Shanghai sold more than 100,000 dan per year. Since the Shanghai Incident, transportation has been blocked, and costs and freight have increased, and the selling price has gradually become more expensive. People's purchasing power is weak, so in the past two years, less than 100,000 dan has been sold each year. If control is established again, regardless of how much commission is charged, the goods will be transported to the warehouse, and then distributed to various places from the warehouse. The cost of the car and the labor spent on the road is already considerable, plus the high prices. The result will be to rival imported brandies and whiskeys. I ask, does the lower and middle classes of society have the economic power to buy it? Moreover, the containers of local shaojiu are of different sizes, and the ingredients vary greatly. It is not easy to transport and sell them, and they must be weighed and returned to their original containers. Even if you want to control them, it is not a

fact that one can count on. In general, at this time when everything is expensive, local shaojiu is one of the consumer goods. We should find ways to unblock the source and try to reduce the selling price, so that we can barely maintain it. How can we allow it to be wantonly destroyed and pushed to suicide? For this reason, our entire industry is resolutely opposed to the organization of the liquor market. We will never obey. At the same time, we urge someone or other to quickly get over themselves and stop acting so recklessly and no longer be active, so as to avoid being abandoned by the public, so that the livelihoods of all people can be prolonged. We hope that our humble intentions will be noted.

### 郵員要求津貼　交部電復酌增

Postal workers request allowance increase. Ministry of Communications telegraph reply: discretionary increase.

The Shanghai Postal Administration and all its branch offices' Class A and B postal workers have been ordered to receive 80% of their salary after the war, and this has been the case for more than three years. However, currently, the price of goods in the market has soared and life is difficult. The entire body of postal workers sent a joint letter to the Postal Workers' Union last month, requesting that it telegraph the Minister of Communications Zhang Gongquan, to approve the restoration of their original salary, so as to maintain their meager livelihoods. According to a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency, Zhang has telegraphed to Shanghai, approving a discretionary increase in allowances. However, the amount has not yet been officially announced by the Shanghai Post Office Director Zha Peilin.

### 中賑會　撫輯難民

The Central Relief Committee provides relief to refugees.

頒訂統一救濟辦法滬市善團已奉明電

Unified relief methods have been issued. Shanghai charity groups have received clear telegrams.

The Central Relief Committee believes that as the war zone is expanding, refugees who have no home to return to should be properly assisted. It has specially formulated unified relief methods and instructed relief agencies across the country to comply with them. Charity groups in Shanghai have received the above methods, which are recorded as follows: (1) Refugees, regardless of age, will be issued 2 jiao of national currency per person per day in accordance with regulations. Relief tickets should be filled out. If relief tickets are not available, the refugees should sign, stamp, or fingerprint to acknowledge receipt for verification. (2) Counties may spend relief funds as needed and truthfully, subject to review by the county council and forwarded for reporting, without waiting for orders to use them. (3) Relief funds will be issued by the province as reserve funds. If the reserve funds are insufficient, a telegram will be sent for verification and issuance, and funds may also be advanced from other transferable funds. (4) Each county should immediately mobilize local people with credibility or enthusiasm for relief to organize a refugee handling committee in order to concentrate manpower and participate in the handling of relief. (5) Evacuating refugees should issue refugee certificates in accordance with regulations, filling in the evacuation location, and strictly verifying to prevent spies and Japanese plainclothes teams. Except for those who have special tasks, refugees are generally not allowed to return to the occupied areas. (6) In special circumstances, when parents of children in areas close to the war zone are unable to carry them away, the county should assign special personnel to quickly rescue and concentrate them for care, and find ways to send them to safe areas. All lost and orphaned children should be widely taken in by the county. Relief funds for transporting children should be reported in accordance with the rate of 2 jiao of national currency per person per day for food and transportation costs. After the children are transported to safe areas, a telegram should be sent immediately to await orders for handling.

Their actions are commendable. It is hoped that all sectors will emulate them.

### 義國在滬購地　建義僑中心區　其中將有敎堂醫院學校有華麗總會供社交活動

Italy purchases land in Shanghai to build a center for the Italian community, which will include a church, hospital, school, and a luxurious clubhouse for social activities.

The Zi Lin Bao newspaper said that after the Italian government purchased a piece of land in western Shanghai from the Municipal Council, the Italian community in the city will have its own church, hospital, school, and clubhouse. It is expected that these new buildings will begin construction on the purchased land in two months. It is known that the land is located between Great Western Road, Difeng Road, and Jing'an Temple Road, opposite Hong En Hospital.

呈三角形

Shaped like a triangle

It measures 25 mu and 201, and was purchased by Italian Consul General to Shanghai, Ni Long, on behalf of the Italian government through negotiations with the Municipal Council. The land deed will be transferred at the beginning of this week, but the Municipal Council has several small houses built on the land, which will continue to be occupied until the end of March, after which the land will be handed over to the Italian side and will become the new "center" of the Italian community in Shanghai. According to the Italian people in Shanghai, in addition to the Italian General Assembly, there is no special

Schools and hospitals

The authorities have been considering this kind of need for more than a day. Now that the new land is available, they will build a large number of buildings. Yesterday (the 25th), Ni Long told reporters that, for the sake of convenience, the new buildings will be built together. Undoubtedly, the Italian bridge in this city will recognize the new buildings as their

All activities

The Italian government purchased this land because the Italian community had this need. According to the current Italian community in Shanghai, they all go to various churches in the city to attend worship. On special dates, they go to the Italian church in Shanghai to attend Mass. However, when the new buildings are completed, the Italian community will have its own church and hospital, etc. When the school is completed, it will be able to meet the greatest needs of the Italian community. Because there is no Italian school in the city now,

Children of Italian expatriates

All go to foreign schools for education. As for the social center, a luxurious Italian clubhouse will be built in the new house. However, the sale of the land has not yet been announced. The English-language Great American Evening Post said that Philip, the Director General of the Municipal Council, told reporters today (the 26th) that the reason why the land opposite Hong En Hospital, which has now been sold to the Italian government, was not put up for public auction was because the Municipal Council did not intend to let the land be used for

Commercial development

For this reason, the Municipal Council really has the intention of keeping the land for future development, but the Italian government requested to buy it, and its price was considered reasonable, and it was used to build a center for the Italian community, which is beneficial to the Italian community and has public value, so the Municipal Council allowed the sale, and I am not willing to disclose the price at present, but when the land deed is signed, the Bureau will issue an announcement.

### 老鳳祥銀樓股東拆股未遂　經理接嚇詐信　具名特務隊索詐鉅款研究筆跡郭秀開被捕該樓前晚被盜刦鉅款

Old Phoenix Silver Building shareholders split shares unsuccessfully. The manager receives a threatening letter demanding a large sum of money from a named secret service team. Handwriting expert Guo Xiukai arrested. The building was robbed of a large sum of money the night before last.

Old Phoenix Silver Building at No. 432 Nanjing Road was opened by Fei Zushou, Fei Changnian, Guo Yutang, Xu Busheng and others as partners for many years. Fei Zushou served as the manager and made a good profit. However, since January 28 last year, Guo Yutang suddenly announced that he wanted to split his shares and

Request an audit

As a result of the audit, Guo Yutang believes that the capital and dividends that he should receive for splitting his shares should be more than 190,000 yuan. However, Fei Zushou believes that Guo's settlement method is not realistic. According to a fair settlement, Guo's principal and income are only more than 50,000 yuan. The method and amount of payment are too far apart, so the share split has not been resolved so far. Guo Yutang has repeatedly stated that Fei has engaged in fraudulent behavior and must file a lawsuit, but there has been no action. Until December 25 and 29 of last year, Fei Zushou received two threatening letters from a named special service team. Although the letters did not mention the amount of money being demanded, the wording was extremely threatening. Fei was afraid and entrusted lawyers Jiang Baoli and Jiang Pingfan to report to the Old Gate Patrol Room. After investigation by Western Detective Heerkux and Chinese Detective Xue Youwen, it was considered that Guo Yutang's son Guo Xiukai (Chaozhou native, 23 years old, residing at No. 5, Lane 271, Xiafei Road) was highly suspected. After investigating Guo Xiukai's usual letters and checking the handwriting, the handwriting of the threatening letters was found to be very similar to the handwriting written by Guo. He was again summoned to the patrol room to write numbers for comparison, which was also very similar. His handwriting was also obtained from Guo's school, and Mei Yu, a handwriting expert from the Municipal Council, made a detailed identification, which also determined that the threatening letters were written by Guo Xiukai. The patrol room then reported to the First Special Court and issued an arrest warrant. Guo Xiukai was arrested the day before yesterday and sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Patrol Room lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted him for the crimes of obstructing freedom, threatening fraud, and attempted fraud under Articles 304, 305, and 346 of the Criminal Law. Since this case still needs to be investigated, it was requested that the hearing be postponed. The defendant Guo Xiukai stated that the threatening letters were not written by him. There are many traces of his handwriting left at the Old Phoenix Building, which are very easy to verify. How could he write a threatening letter to the plaintiff in his own handwriting? Therefore, there are obvious doubts in this matter, and he hired lawyer Zou Yu to defend him. Judge Xiao Xiefei verified the confession and ordered Guo Xiukai to be remanded in custody for another hearing in a week. In addition, Old Phoenix Silver Building was suddenly invaded by five bandits at 10:20 the night before last. Three bandits were armed with pistols and first monitored the people inside, and then tried to open the vault, stealing all the gold and silver utensils and cash in the vault, totaling more than 100,000 yuan. Afterwards, the building reported to the Old Gate Patrol Room and ordered detectives to investigate the matter and strictly arrest the thieves for investigation and prosecution.

### 恐嚇詐財　兩犯被捕審結

Two criminals arrested and tried for intimidation and fraud.

Zhou Dasheng, the owner of the Xie Xing Iron Factory in Caojiadu, western Shanghai, lives at No. 51, Lane 831, Qiwupu Road, Hongkou. At 6:30 pm on the 22nd of this month, Zhu Genquan and others from Wuxi suddenly went to Zhou's house, claiming that Zhou was a guerrilla and had to be detained at the Japanese Command. If he could pay 5,000 yuan, they could find a way to get him out. At that time, Zhou happened to be out, so his wife Zhu and his mother Zhang negotiated on his behalf and agreed to talk again the next day. At that time, Lu Fangquan from Jiangxi went to Zhou's house, and Zhou reported him to the Yulin Road Patrol Room, who sent Detective Peng Zhenxuan to arrest Zhu and Lu. Later, Wang Yuzhen from Wuxi was arrested at No. 47, Mingyu Fang, Huade Road, and brought to the patrol room. They were sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Patrol Room lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted them according to law. According to Zhou Dasheng's accusations, the defendants pushed the blame on each other during the interrogation. Judge Xiao verified the confession and ordered the three defendants to be detained for sentencing on March 1.

### Agricultural and Industrial Bank of China, Nanjing Branch - Business Director Embezzlement

Sentenced to Imprisonment for One Year and Six Months

The Nanjing Branch of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank of China retreated to Shanghai after the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle. The head office discovered that Hu Xiaoquan (over forty years old), the business director of the branch and a native of Tianjin, had been continuously engaging in fraud before the war, embezzling more than 10,000 taels of public funds from the bank. The head office reported this to the French Concession police, and on May 7th of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], Hu was arrested by detectives and brought before the Special No. 2 Court. After questioning and detention, due to jurisdictional issues, a request was submitted to the Shanghai branch of the Supreme Court for designation. The Special No. 2 Court accepted the case for trial. The lawyer representing the administrative authorities of the French Concession prosecuted the defendant for embezzlement in business. Later, after auditing the accounts, it was found that the actual amount embezzled by Hu, after offsetting income and expenses, was short by more than 5,000 yuan. This case has been ongoing for more than a year. Judge Sun Pengxian has repeatedly held court hearings for investigation. Hu hired lawyers Wang Yuan and Gu to defend him. After deliberation, the case was concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun announced the verdict, sentencing Hu Xiaoquan to one year and six months of imprisonment for continuous embezzlement. During the appeal period, he was allowed to be released on bail with a surety of 5,000 yuan, ready to appear at any time.

### Claiming to Have Found Lost Banknotes - Cigarette Store Owner Arrested

Liu Wuzhai, a native of Wuxi, 40 years old, residing at No. 285 Baille Road and working for the Sin Feng Foreign Firm, was gambling at the Yiyuan Dog Racing Track at 5:05 PM on the 25th when he lost 100 yuan in banknotes from his suit pocket. Ding Chunzi, a native of Tongzhou who was buying tickets for Lingjiang, saw it. Just as he was about to call out to Liu to pick it up, Ma Chengrong, a native of Ningbo (33 years old) and the owner of the Xin Gong He Xiang cigarette shop at the intersection of Xinxin Street and Avenue Edward VII, was also present. He stepped forward and falsely claimed to have found it, picking up the banknotes. Liu had already noticed and rushed over to claim them, leading to a fierce dispute between Liu and Ma. Police detectives Ke Enqing and Ke Enqi of the French Concession police investigated and took both parties, along with the lost banknotes, to the police station. After questioning by the police chief, it was determined that the banknotes were indeed lost by Liu, and Ma had acted to seize another person's movable property. Ma was detained and will be sent to the court for prosecution.

### Shanghai Children's Hospital - Reception for Child Welfare Organizations

The Shanghai Children's Hospital at No. 65 Rue Molière held a tea party for the child welfare sector at 3:30 PM yesterday (the 26th). Representatives from over sixty organizations, including the Chinese Child Welfare Association, the Chinese Women and Children Relief Society, the Children's Protection Association, the Street Children's Education Association, the Poor Children's Out-of-School Relief Center, the Child Welfare Training Institute, the Gonghua Children's Shelter, the Nursery Department of the Tai Jiabao Relief Home, the Hudong Commune Apprentice Night School, and the Shanghai School for the Blind, attended. First, Hospital Director Fu Wenshou reported on the hospital's operations, stating that the hospital was established in December of the 26th year of the Republic [i.e., 1937] and was originally named the Shanghai Refugee Children's Hospital. It was renamed the Shanghai Children's Hospital in June of the 28th year [i.e., 1939]. The hospital now has a total of 100 beds, of which 75 are free beds, donated by organizations such as the American Relief Association, the China International Famine Relief Commission, the Chinese Women's Association, the Rotary Club of Shanghai, and the German Community Association of Shanghai. The hospital has an X-ray machine, donated by the Li Yunshan family and friends, for examining the physical condition of sick children. The diet is completely controlled by dietetics experts, a first in Shanghai. Clothing is enthusiastically provided by the hospital's women's auxiliary, with donations reaching over 4,000 yuan. All major and minor surgeries are performed by expert physicians, striving to provide the best possible service to sick children. In the future, if any child welfare organizations send sick children, the hospital will do its best to accommodate them, but they must be responsible for taking them back quickly after they recover to avoid occupying beds and hindering other sick children. It is hoped that all child welfare organizations can fully understand and cooperate with each other. After Director Fu's report, representatives from various organizations raised questions and exchanged ideas. Finally, the hospital director led a tour of the various departments and facilities. The meeting adjourned at about 6:00 PM.

The Sixth Medical Team of the New Life Movement Association, organized by doctors and nurses from major hospitals in this city, recently left Shanghai under the leadership of team leader Dr. Mei Xu and team members Wu Xuezhen, Mei Guozhen, and others, a group of more than ten people. They arrived in Jinhua via Ningbo and then transferred to Jiangxi Province to serve. The people along the way were impressed by the fact that the team members were all doctors and nurses from major hospitals in Shanghai, living relatively comfortably, and that they were now leaving the isolated island to participate in rescue work in the interior, enduring the hardships of wartime life. Therefore, they were welcomed and entertained with great enthusiasm.

### Southern City - Thorns Everywhere - Gambling Flourishes, Robbers Run Rampant - Rumors of Increased Taxes on Gambling Dens in Western Shanghai

Since the opening of the Southern City, a gang of gamblers from Western Shanghai has developed towards the Southern City, making it a second breeding ground for criminals. Those that opened before the Lunar New Year include the large gambling dens in Pinhua Lane on Anren Street near the City God Temple and the Tongbaotai at Jiumudi. Those that opened the day before yesterday include the Hengan gambling den in Hengan Lane near Nanyang Bridge, the Dafu Company at the old site of the Guandi Temple's Quanfu Restaurant near Laoximen, the Xingfa Company in Kongjia Lane, and the Xieli gambling den behind the Gonghe Cinema in Wengjia Lane. The Sanxing Company near Xinbeimen is scheduled to open soon. These are purely gambling establishments, offering games such as Twenty-One, Pai Gow, and Yaotan. They even have advertisements posted in front of the doors and hire female attendants and women to roll dice, using brothel-style methods and pornography to lure and extort money. In the past, those who worked as bouncers and were also robbers were rampant in Western Shanghai. Now, this group of criminals has followed the leaders of the gambling gangs into the Southern City, leading to frequent robbery cases. The Southern City has become a place full of thorns. It is also said that the gambling dens in Western Shanghai have jointly contributed 1.6 million yuan for supplies for another six months. Furthermore, it is rumored that the gambling dens in Western Shanghai will be closed at the end of this month. However, whether this will actually happen is attracting attention from both Chinese and foreigners. It is understood that the Japanese method of cracking down on gambling dens is to strictly order all gambling dens to triple the daily license fees they pay. If they cannot afford it, the Japanese will send military police to seal them up. Currently, business in the gambling dens in Western Shanghai is very sluggish. The weaker gambling dens are already showing signs of collapse. It is feared that more than a dozen will close down. It is heard that the gambling dens such as Dasheng Shenji in Xin Kang Lane are preparing to close down.

### Assassination Attempt on Ge Shusen - Gunman Captured After Being Shot - Prosecution for Attempted Murder After Recovery

Ge Shusen, a native of Hubei, 58 years old, formerly worked in the Municipal Police Bureau. Ge resigned after the outbreak of the war and later became the chairman of the Western Shanghai Manufacturers Association. He lived at No. 4, Lane 913, Fuxu Road. At 9:50 AM on December 8th of last year, Ge was walking from his home to the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Fuxu Road, waiting for a public bus when he was suddenly shot. The bullet hit Ge's buttocks. At that time, Western Deputy Police Chief Bryce and Western Third Road Patrolman Conway of the Jing'an Temple Police Station happened to be patrolling nearby. They heard the alert and helped chase after the attacker. The two sides exchanged fire, resulting in the arrest of Wang Sanxiao, a native of Jiangbei, who was the attacker. He was wounded in the neck. He, along with a Mauser rifle, four bullets, and two shell casings, were taken to the police station and sent to the hospital for treatment. Ge Shusen went to the Fumin Hospital for treatment himself. Now that Wang Sanxiao has recovered from his injuries, he was escorted to the First Special Court's Criminal Division No. 2 yesterday morning. The police, based on the fact that Wang resisted arrest at the time and opened fire to harm the Western police officer, prosecuted him for attempted murder in accordance with Article 271, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, Wang Sanxiao admitted that he was ordered by his captain to shoot Ge Shusen, but he only fired one shot because the bullet was jammed, so he did not continue firing. Judge Xiao announced the conclusion of the debate on the case and scheduled the verdict for March 1st.

### Finance - Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand Still Balanced

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed price remained unchanged. The black market for British and American exchange rates was sluggish, which was rare this year. Trading was stagnant. The daily buying and selling opened flat, still at 4 shillings 1.5625 pence and 6.84375 yuan. The market was quiet afterwards. Although Sassoon's Hong Kong telegram and a certain American bank successively sold, foreign firms and Chinese banks bought, offsetting each other, so there was no impact. There was no improvement, and the market hovered until 3:00 PM, when a sudden buying interest from Lever Brothers and Belgian foreign banks caused the market to show a slight softening. By the evening close, British gold was only at 4 shillings 1.40625 pence, and American exchange was only at 6.8125 yuan, resulting in a slight increase of 0.015625 and 0.03125 compared to the end of last week. As the settlement date for February approaches, many speculators are posting bonds, so swap trading is booming. These are all bought by foreign banks such as HSBC. The price of US dollars is 0.09375, which is about 1.18% monthly interest. Among them, some banks once bought US dollars at 0.078125, which is about 1.15% monthly interest.

After the opening, Sassoon first sold spot British gold to Lever at 4 shillings 1.5625 pence, in a stable condition. HSBC's listed price was announced unchanged, and the silver balance tax was also announced with no increase or decrease. Later, Hong Kong telegrams also followed suit, and a certain American bank also intended to sell. However, a certain Chinese bank and foreign firms came to buy, so the supply and demand continued to be balanced, and the market remained unchanged. It is estimated that Hong Kong telegrams provided spot British gold to foreign banks at 4 shillings 1.5625 pence, and a certain American bank sold March American exchange to Chinese banks and foreign firms at 6.78115 and 6.75 yuan. At the same time, foreign firms re-settled spot American exchange to a certain bank at 6.84375 yuan. Afterwards, February swap trading was quite active, while spot transactions were relatively thin. Most of the swap bonds were posted by speculators, about US$0.09375, and were bought by foreign banks such as HSBC. The Sino-Japanese Bank also posted bonds to foreign banks at a price of only 0.078125. The situation was even quieter at noon. The closing price for British gold remained at 4 shillings 1.5625 pence, and American exchange also remained at 6.84375 yuan, with no change compared to the morning opening.

Lever Brothers and Belgian Banks Suddenly Settle

Swap trading continued in the afternoon, with the swap prices for distant months being higher than those for nearby months. Speculators continued to post US$0.09375. However, the spot potential was still quite sluggish at that time. Around 3:00 PM, Lever Brothers and Belgian banks suddenly had buying intentions, absorbing the current month's American exchange from fellow banks at 6.84375 yuan, so the market showed a slight softening. By the evening close, British gold was at 4 shillings 1.40625 pence, and American exchange was at 6.8125 yuan. Next month's British gold was at 4 shillings 0.8375 pence, and American exchange was at 6.71875 yuan.

### Small Changes in the Gold Market

Yesterday, the black market situation for spot gold was small, with little fluctuation. Although the potential was tired in people's hearts, it did not fall. As a result, it rose by one yuan compared to the end of last week. This was due to the purchase by Hong Kong gangs and the securities firms buying after selling. The process of the day: the morning opening was flat and tired at 4,770 yuan, a decrease of 14 yuan, because securities firms sold. Then, a certain silver building bought on behalf of customers, and a certain silver company also bought on behalf of its own gang, rising by 11 yuan. However, securities firms intended to sell, and money changers also sold, falling to a low price of 4,763 yuan. Fortunately, retail investors bought at a low price, and certain securities firms also bought, turning the situation slightly. The noon close was 4,773 yuan. The afternoon was initially stable, but then Hong Kong gangs suddenly bought, and the British securities firms that had sold in the morning also returned, so it was once raised to 4,790 yuan. Buyers gradually lacked, slightly falling back. The evening close was 4,785 yuan. The entire day's trading was slightly weak, about 1,200 to 1,300 taels. The price of gold jewelry in silver buildings first fell and then rose, and finally remained flat. Customs gold was stable.

Spot Gold Only Increased by One Yuan

From the initial flat and tired opening, securities firms first sold, but buyers' appetite was not good, so the opening price was pressed down by 14 yuan. Securities firms sold 20 taels to gold shops for 4,770 yuan. Then, because a certain silver building bought on behalf of customers, and a certain company also bought on behalf of its own gang, the market situation once stabilized, rising by 11 yuan. A certain silver company bought 10 taels from money changers for 4,781 yuan. After that, securities firms, gold shops, and money changers sold again, and the buyers' appetite was full, so it fell again by 18 yuan. Securities firms sold 50 taels to silver building gangs for 4,763 yuan. Then, as there were fewer sellers, a certain money changer took the opportunity to buy low, and another securities firm also followed suit, so it rose again by 15 yuan. Money changers bought 30 taels from silver building gangs for 4,778 yuan. At noon, silver building gangs continued to sell, pressing down by another 5 yuan. Silver building gangs sold 50 taels to securities firms for 4,773 yuan, as the noon closing price. The afternoon opened slightly lower by one yuan, with silver building gangs selling 20 taels to a certain silver company for 4,772 yuan. Then, a certain silver building suddenly bought on behalf of a Hong Kong gang, and securities firms also suddenly returned, so it rose by 18 yuan. Securities firms bought 10 taels from money changers for 4,790 yuan. Afterwards, the buying stopped, and money changers sold, so it fell back by 7 yuan. Money changers sold 30 taels to securities firms for 4,783 yuan. At 3:00 PM, silver building gangs traded 50 taels among themselves for 4,785 yuan as the evening closing price.

At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, it returned to a higher price of five yuan. As a result, it remained flat. The larger transactions were still at the original price of 485 yuan. The new transactions were the same as the higher price. The purchase price was reduced by about 15 yuan. Also, the selling price of sycee silver was increased by five cents at 11:10 AM, to five yuan.

### Grain - Rumors of Imported Rice Fail - Prices Plummet

Yesterday, the rice market fell again sharply because the French Consul announced that the statement by the Annam Governor-General that the port of Haiphong was closed for rice was a rumor. Speculators found it difficult to sell and panicked. Some also sold their stock aggressively to escape. The fall reached as much as one yuan. Upon examination, the initial opening prices in the morning did not show an upward trend. However, sellers tried to hold on and were unwilling to sell easily. Later, hoarders withdrew on a large scale and sold aggressively, so sellers had to follow suit, resulting in a continuous decline. One-grade Saigon, which initially opened at 47.3 yuan, had already fallen by half a yuan and closed at only 46 yuan. Huowen fell from the initial opening of 45.6 yuan to 44 yuan. Other goods, except for mixed broken rice and goods at the bottom of the warehouse, which were slightly held up, fell by about one yuan, to 44.5 yuan and 44 yuan. The rest fell by more than two yuan compared to the previous market. Although the mid-day market for Tokyo rice was as low as 40.05 yuan, there were few transactions. Under these circumstances, the bottom line for glutinous rice was small, and it was difficult to maintain its price, falling by about 1.5 yuan. Jintan goods sold for 41 yuan, and Danyang goods ranged from 40.05 yuan to 39 yuan. Thick-grain, thin-grain, early rice, and late rice all fell. It is said that there were few secret market transactions, and the selling price fell by nearly two yuan. Kunshan rice was only 47-48 yuan, and the worst was only 45-46 yuan. Special thin rice was 46 yuan, and early and late rice were 44-45 yuan. The market was repeatedly weak, and the owners were eager to sell. Many goods were transferred from Hongkou to the concession, no less than 5,000 bags.

Imported Rice Arrives in Shanghai Again - The "Qiahe" ship of the Pacific Orient Line, which came from Haiphong, loaded 6,000 bags of imported rice there and 13,714 bags from Hong Kong, totaling 19,714 bags. The ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 25th) and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf. Since it was a Sunday, the unloading began yesterday. Also, the "Shunda" ship of the Taikoo Company sailed to North China, loaded with 3,000 bags of imported rice, which were transported to Yantai.

### Flour Market Firmly Strong, Wheat Market Turns Steady

Yesterday, the flour market was quietly strong. The quotation for No. 2 flour from the flour mill remained at ten yuan. The Fu and Fu flour mills limited their daily sales to 7,500 bags on this street and were unwilling to sell more. It is said that some of the machinery at the Fufeng Mill is damaged and under repair, so flour production has decreased rather than increased. Yesterday, the demand from the inland and merchant groups was relatively active, and the price of goods from the same place rose again due to favorable conditions. It is said that the old "Car Brand" forwarding orders opened at 14.75 yuan. The asking price for "Green Cannon Car" still requires 16 yuan, but no formal transaction has been made. In the market, rice shops sell No. 4 flour for 9.3 yuan.

Yesterday, the wheat market also stabilized. After a sharp drop last week, sellers were unwilling to sell at lower prices. As a result, five to six carloads of Suzhou wheat were traded at the original price of 25.5 yuan, reportedly bought by Xiexin and other mills.

Yesterday, 25,000 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin, handled by Japanese merchants. Also, 500 bags of corn were shipped to Yantai, 2,100 bags of beans were shipped to Hong Kong, and 200 bags of raw peanuts were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Securities: Speculation in Foreign Stocks Remains Strong, Domestic Stocks Exceptionally Dull

The securities gray market saw a sudden shift to inactivity yesterday. Most firms were taking a wait-and-see approach. The situation improved slightly by one or two cents as short sellers made some cover purchases. The news was dull, and the atmosphere was quiet, but many parties, in view of the short covering, took the opportunity to increase their holdings, making the market relatively firm. With no changes in the environment, it may trend towards consolidation. This is because most large investors have shifted their funds to cotton yarn arbitrage, reportedly earning a monthly interest of more than three percent. The public bond market has become dull. Even yesterday's trading on the two exchanges was extremely limited, and the number of attendees was also sparse. Only the "Yi" and "Nei" bonds saw some trading; the rest had very few inquiries. As a result, prices continued to rise by 1.5 to 2.5 cents, with a total trading volume of no more than 300,000. A concise table is listed below.

In stock trading, 50 shares of the Zhonghua Book Company were traded at a price of 30.05 yuan, an increase of another 0.05 yuan compared to the previous day.

Yesterday, the Shanghai Stock Exchange saw a return to the usual firm and upward trend of Mondays. All stocks that were once highly regarded rose. Jardine Matheson shares fell after rising due to profit-taking, but eventually returned to 110 yuan. Ewo Cotton Mill shares rose strongly, reaching a high of 43 yuan at one point, closing at 42.25 yuan. Due to a drop in the price of raw rubber, demand for rubber shares was not strong, but prices remained stable.

In recent days, this newspaper has received many letters from readers regarding foreign stocks, with varying opinions. However, this newspaper's position is to never be biased. Therefore, whether the intentions of "Xin Wei" and "Xin An" are good or bad, we adopt their reasoning, eliminate their excesses, and allow readers to distinguish right from wrong. Impartial publication is for the sake of fairness. We have always opposed speculation, so we do not want to encourage people to speculate, nor do we want to show people how to speculate or inspire them with a desire to speculate. As for superficial writings, we do not adopt them. Only by not having speculative thoughts can one be truly fair. Therefore, we hope that those without true insights will not waste ink on speculative views. Furthermore, the Shanghai Stock Exchange's news is released by the exchange itself, naturally with the exchange's interests as a priority, so please pay attention to their statements.

### American China Securities Dividend

The American China Securities Company decided at a board meeting yesterday to distribute a cash dividend on March 12 at an annual interest rate of 6%. Part of this dividend is a special dividend. In accordance with the US China Trade Act, part of the common stock dividend should be distributed according to the shareholder register on December 31, 1939, and the other part according to the shareholder register on March 8, 1940.

### Yarn and Cotton: Profit-Taking Emerges, Yarn Prices Fall Slightly

The yarn market has stabilized somewhat, but the actual demand in South China and inland areas is gradually showing signs of growth. However, due to the approach of the end of the month for February futures, profit-takers are actively closing out positions, causing the market to loosen slightly. At the same time, although the exchange rate is firm, there have been no major changes. Gold is slightly weak, and sentiment is mediocre, making the market slightly sluggish. However, the raw cotton situation is extremely strong, making it difficult for factories to reduce costs.

The opening market for current yarn was quiet this morning. At the same time, the exchange rate remained firm. The asking price for 20-count Shuang Ma yarn was 864 yuan, and the price for March futures was 883 yuan. Shortly after, the market turned weak due to an increase in profit-takers and arbitrageurs, and prices fell slightly. The March futures price fell to 875 yuan, and the February price was 858 yuan. However, large investors returned to buy at this price, and the market stabilized. According to half-day transaction statistics, 2,325 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn was down 5.5 yuan. Yesterday, 415 pieces of yarn were shipped to Siam, 16 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 160 pieces were shipped to Xiamen, and 85 pieces were shipped to Tianjin. The amount bought by each merchant group is as follows:

### Cotton Trading: Mostly Among Dealers, Market Remains Strong

Cotton trading remains strong, mostly among dealers buying and selling among themselves. Factories, both Japanese and British, only make occasional purchases. Sentiment is particularly bullish, and the market is firm. Tonghua cotton remains at 203 yuan, and 42-count raw material Metre cotton is priced at 260 yuan. 1,750 bales of Tonghua cotton from Subei have arrived. Yesterday, 60 bales of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong and 10 bales were shipped to Saigon. The current cotton situation is listed on the left.

In other news, the price of foreign cotton is as follows: The New York cotton market opened very strong this morning. Prices rose first due to speculative buying, and then due to buying by dealers and overseas cotton merchants, as well as some short covering. As a result, closing prices were up 5-6 points to more than 10 points compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by more than two rupees, and Egyptian cotton rose by 5-6 points.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market has been quite good recently. However, due to the approach of the end of the month, funds are tighter, so trading is slightly sluggish. Factories have consistently adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The activity of the cotton market relies solely on dealers. The following is the price of US Mer cotton at 6.8125 yuan converted for delivery to the factory:

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Rises by One Yuan, Raw Oil Sales Stagnant and Prices Continue to Fall

Yesterday, the soybean oil market was unremarkable in the morning session due to average sentiment among buyers and sellers. After entering the session, transactions increased, and the market became lively, but its scope was narrow, and there was no opportunity for manipulation. Sentiment was still not excited, so the price was slightly higher than last weekend by one yuan. According to statistics, 150 barrels of Dalian crude oil were traded at a price of 115-116 yuan, 20 barrels of Hankou oil were traded at a price of 114 yuan, 12 barrels of Bengbu oil were traded at a price of 113.5 yuan, 100 dan of Dayou factory oil were traded at a price of 91 yuan, and 50 dan of Pudong Changde factory oil (operated by Japanese merchants) were traded at a price of 88.5 yuan. Peanut oil prices continued to fall because of the lack of activity from merchants in Hong Kong. Only 50 barrels of Qingdao oil were traded at a price of 115 yuan.

### Coal: Processed Coal Also Subject to Monopoly, Gray Market Price Rises Sharply by Sixty Yuan

The price of processed coal usually fluctuates with the price of coal balls. In January, the market price was only 90 yuan, but recently, under the pretext of rising bituminous coal prices and related costs, the price has increased by 60 yuan per ton, driving up the price of coal balls. In reality, this is due to sellers hoarding and speculating, intentionally monopolizing the market and unwilling to sell easily, leading to a surge in the gray market. The asking price for lump coal is 150 yuan per ton, and medium lump coal is 140 yuan per ton, delivered to customers, with an additional handling fee. It is said that a certain processed coal dealer in the city is stockpiling large quantities of coal and unwilling to sell, further driving up the market price.

### Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Prices Rebound

Yesterday, according to Dutch telegraphs, the production price of raw white sugar, according to C.I.F.C.I. standards, was 6.12 Dutch guilders.

The near-term price was 1621 yuan, up 17 yuan, and the far-term price was 1611 yuan, up 20 yuan. The afternoon closing price was 1609 yuan, down 2 yuan. In the local silk market, a white factory sold 10 dan of B-grade Xinfu silk at 4950 yuan, and a Ji Li silk merchant sold 2520 yuan for secondary brands and 20 dan sold by Dachang at 30 yuan less than the previous price. There have been sporadic transactions of user white factory silk recently, as demand for spring silk is already active.

The green tea market remains sluggish. European firms are gradually listing Hong Kong red and green teas. Many tea masters have gone to X to purchase goods, and Shanghai tea prices are high, and the quality is inferior, so sales are very poor. Yesterday, only Anhe Shilong and other firms purchased over 110 boxes of green tea such as Zhenmei and Xizhen. Zhenmei sold for 265 yuan, and Xizhen sold for 98 yuan. Prices were 5-6 to 10 yuan lower than before.

Fujian tea has been arriving for several days. Yesterday, 5,000 pieces were shipped to Dajin, 34 pieces of Ningbo tea were shipped to Xiamen, and 175 pieces of tea were shipped to Hong Kong (annual).

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Spring Sales Are Starting Up Again

Light-colored fine yarn woven products are selling quite well, and the market is firm, as spring sales have begun. However, the cost of natural-colored gray cloth has increased due to dyeing and finishing factories raising their processing fees, making them more expensive than finished goods on the market, so demand is gradually weakening. The selling price has no power to rise. Jardine Matheson's coarse cloth prices continue to rise. 16-pound group cloths are becoming scarce on the market, and the price of each brand has increased by 0.25 yuan. The retail prices of fine cloth and twill are slightly loose due to month-end payments and tight credit. Transactions are most active on this street, with sales to Wenzhou, Guangdong, Hong Kong, northern Anhui, and Nanyang merchants being the most robust, totaling over 1,000 pieces.

Eastern cloth was weak in the morning and strong in the afternoon, trending towards stability. The spot price of white cotton leading fine cloth fell to 16.45 yuan per piece in the morning, but then rose again due to purchases from Qinhuangdao merchants, closing at 26.6 yuan. Four Gentlemen twill is currently priced at 0.7875 yuan per yard, while next month's futures still require 0.8275 yuan.

Exports: Piece goods exports on the 26th included 125 pieces shipped to Tianjin, 199 pieces shipped to Xiamen, and 230 pieces shipped to Siam.

### Yuanzhi Tribute Goods are Rare and Expensive

Yuanqing Tribute flannel is quite scarce in the market, and the sales target is the shoe merchant group. The colors are mostly Huaxin, Chunhe, and Yong. It is difficult to order goods, and the general market price is soaring. Yesterday, the market price for Lihe 10630 was 22 yuan per yard, Lu Lin 1868 sold for 18.5 yuan, 5885 sold for 23 yuan, Hengli 7131 sold for 24 yuan, Yinfeng 201 sold for 19 yuan, Hunter Sheng 2376 sold for 21.5 yuan, Xiexin 3000 sold for 17.5 yuan, Donghuo 10000 sold for 16.5 yuan, and 559 Sima Xiangru sold for 14 yuan.

### Dried and Fresh Goods: Black Melon Seeds Tighten

Due to the thin arrival of black melon seed orders, they have gradually increased since the Hong Kong X. According to the overall market inventory, Dalian seeds are the most numerous, about 10 carloads. The rest are only scattered. The production price of Dalian seeds has risen repeatedly, and the difference between the Shanghai market and the Dalian market is more than 10 yuan. Therefore, the last batch is difficult to come again. As a result, it is particularly tight. Yesterday's market price was 70 yuan for Jikui seeds, 67-65 yuan for Xukui seeds, 65 yuan for Tongcheng seeds, 60 yuan for Mingguang seeds, and 58 yuan for Dalian seeds.

### Hardware: Light Demand for Round Bars

New round bar transactions are most active among nail factories on this street (since they are the raw material for local nails). However, recently, due to weakening sales of local nails, nail factories are less busy, leading to reduced demand for new round bars. The market is stagnant, sentiment is weakening, and prices have fallen by 2 yuan. The current market price is around 49 yuan per dan. Yesterday's market only traded 170-180 dan. Only merchants in Yantai made occasional purchases.

### The Freedom to Starve

— Jia

The other day, a homeless Russian woman, driven by hunger and cold, had a whimsical idea. She ran to the French Concession police station and asked to be imprisoned. The people at the police station refused her request because she had not committed a crime. Helpless, she said she was a heroin addict. The people at the police station didn't believe her and drove her away. She had no choice but to leave in disappointment.

Because the problem of food and housing was not solved, she came up with a clever plan. She chose a bakery and broke the large glass window. As a result, she finally achieved her goal and entered prison with a happy smile.

From the perspective of another society, this is a small, humorous, and sad fact. When readers see this piece of social news, their eyes must be filled with tears, and a faint, heartfelt smile must be on their lips.

After this Russian woman was arrested, I don't know what crime the judge will sentence her for or what punishment he will impose on her. A fine? That would certainly be like trying to climb a tree to catch a fish. Imprisonment? In her eyes, that would be solving the problem of food and lodging, which is exactly what she was seeking. In such cases, the law is merely a formality.

Here, the current society reveals an unhideable major flaw.

"Give me liberty, or give me death!" This famous saying does not seem to apply here. In fact, there is nothing wrong with the saying itself. The Russian woman who asked to be imprisoned was not trying to exchange her freedom for a full stomach. She was escaping another kind of freedom, a terrible freedom—the "freedom to starve" that the current society had given her!

### The Anti-War Movement of American Students

— 

Today, as war is approaching, authorities in various countries, in addition to actively preparing for war, are also intensifying military training for the youth of the country. But despite the enthusiastic efforts of authorities in various countries to prepare for war, the anti-war mentality of students in general is growing, especially among American university students. They have even expanded their aversion to war into large-scale actions.

According to recent surveys, most of the young people detained in American prisons in a year are there because they participated in anti-war demonstrations, and relatively few are there because of personal misconduct.

In the United States, according to the votes of more than 22,600 students from 65 universities, 8,938 votes indicated an absolute refusal to participate in any international war; more than 7,300 votes indicated that they would only be willing to fight in order to defend the territory of the United States; and only a very small number were willing to unconditionally obey the national mobilization order. The motives for students' anti-war sentiment may be due to religious beliefs or support for the League of Nations, but the most dominant factor influencing this anti-war sentiment seems to be "skepticism about war." This can be proven by looking at the anti-war publications or leaflets from American universities in the past few years. They all share the same suspicion: war is a competition for profits among the elderly, and young people are just used as cannon fodder. They also hate aggressors the most and are very sympathetic to the weak.

Various anti-war articles often appear in American student publications, calling out loudly and sharply to awaken the anti-war ideas of students across the country. For example: "Don't hesitate anymore: munitions merchants, along with industrial and economic interests, are preparing for another brutal showdown to decide who will rule the world's markets... Students, what is our answer to this conspiracy? If we are determined, we can stop the war. We should work early. They also made countless banners, writing on them!" "Abolish R.O.T.C!" (Reserve Officers' Training Corps) Refuse to cooperate with the government to participate in any war!"

As for the extent to which the American students' anti-war movement has spread now, it is difficult to say. Judging from the situation in the past few years, broadly speaking, this sentiment is strongest in the eastern United States, with its stronghold often in urban schools. To date, American student anti-war organizations include the following:

(1) Student League for Industrial Democracy (2) National Student League. In addition to "anti-war," the goals of these two also include opposing unequal treatment of black students and other educational issues. The former was established earlier, and now has more than 100 branches in universities and publishes a monthly magazine called "Student Outlook." The latter has been established for eight years and publishes a monthly magazine called "Student Review." (3) American Anti-War and Anti-Fascist League. This organization, along with the above two, forms the left wing of the peace movement in American universities. It publishes a monthly magazine called "The Battle." (4) Green International. This is an international student organization whose members all wear green shirts. Its presence in the United States is not large, but it has branches in universities such as "Wisconsin," "Paris," "Imperial," and "Oxford." Its main goal is to oppose aggressive armament.

### Scientific Predictions

— Zhi Hui

Edison's Predictions

Thirty-two years ago, the great American scientist Edison answered many questions from a New York Times reporter. Those answers became invaluable predictions about the future world at that time.

His predictions were, of course, entirely about science. They were:

1. The golden age of steel-reinforced concrete buildings.
2. The invention of sound films with dialogue.
3. Railway electrification.
4. The invention of electrolytic nitrogen fertilizer.
5. The development of water mill constitutions.
6. The success of the aviation industry, especially the postal aviation industry.
7. Serums have discovered unexpected effects on human health, extending life.
8. There are often discoveries and methods of natural forces, so new things that have never been experienced often appear.
9. The use of coal is greatly expanded.

The above is an outstanding record from the New York Times in 1908. Looking at it today, almost all of Edison's great predictions have been fulfilled. Items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9 are obvious facts. Items 4 and 7 are also not far from completion. As for the eighth item, and the new things created by nature, they are countless. Isn't the Rainbow lamp one of the most wonderful things that makes use of natural action?

Future Predictions

The great Edison has already left the crowd, so what will the scientific progress be like in the next thirty years? Edison can no longer tell us. Now let's listen to the predictions of Professor Farnese (C.C. Farnese) of Yale University in the United States:

1. Three-dimensional buildings will increase.
2. The popularity of residential ventilation equipment (such as heating and air conditioning).
3. The use of radio transmission (also known as television) will increase.
4. The methods of using agricultural products in industry will increase.
5. The textile industry will be greatly changed due to the invention of some new fiber.
6. The use of light metals (such as aluminum and nickel) will be infinitely expanded.
7. The invention of a panacea.
8. The adjustment of food production, that is, to produce in large quantities what is most beneficial to the human body, and reduce the production of secondary products.
9. The progress of human life science and the extension of life.
10. The increased use of plastic materials (such as metal).

If the above ten predictions can be realized one by one, then our world thirty years from now will indeed have a different view.

Cultivation

### Cultivating Interests in Life

— Yang Tongfang

Chinese people are often not good at utilizing their leisure time, lacking hobbies that foster physical and mental development. This is especially true for young working adults who, unable to find suitable pastimes during their time off, feel bored and empty. As for those who are unwilling to be "idle," they pursue highly stimulating sights and sounds, wasting valuable time on unhealthy habits that harm their well-being, which is truly regrettable.

According to psychological research, if a person cannot channel their surplus energy in appropriate directions, their physical and mental health will not develop properly. Utilizing leisure time and cultivating hobbies can not only provide proper balance in our lives, preventing boredom and emptiness, but also strengthen our belief in life, enrich its meaning, and expand our experiences. The achievements of many inventors and artists stem from their skillful use of leisure time and the cultivation of interests; this is certainly not without reason.

Therefore, the "interests in life" discussed here are very broad, encompassing any beneficial physical and mental activities outside of work. We can all cultivate these interests according to our inclinations, such as literature, art, painting, music, sculpture, travel, and sports. The value of these interests should surpass ordinary recreation; they can enlighten personality and cultivate virtue. When we feel that these interests are inseparable from life, we will deeply understand the importance of using leisure time to cultivate them.

The physical health and mental vitality of Westerners fully demonstrate their love for hobbies. They readily participate in activities like travel, swimming, boating, and skating, regarding them as essential interests in life. Even in terms of reading newspapers and magazines, Chinese people would rather abandon this valuable spiritual food and waste time and energy on gambling, which is a clear example of neglecting interests in life.

I hope that those who spend their time in listless and frivolous amusements will wake up early and seek meaningful and valuable interests in life!

### "Package"

— Li Li

When life is mentioned, everyone thinks of walking, a very familiar analogy. But, some people remember they are walking when they take a step, while others forget.

May I ask, where are you going on your vast journey? East? West? South? North? A casual question is enough to leave you bewildered for a while.

The road of life is not a paved road. You cannot wander aimlessly. You should pack your bags, shoulder the package of hope, and pursue your journey.

The heavy little package presses on your back, alerting you and urging you on. Thus, you will no longer lose your way, nor will you be bewildered by having nowhere to return.

Remember to grab a heavy package, not a light one. But, where is your package?

### Hollywood Gleanings

Charlie Chaplin's new film "The Great Dictator," after more than two years of painstaking production, was finally completed last month. It is now learned that the new work to be produced in succession has been decided to be based on the original work "Liberty Bell" by the great British writer, Curt Frick. The story of the film narrates the historical events of the Indian nation's resistance against the British invasion in 1877 and will still be carefully adapted by Loren Full, the screenwriter of "The Great Dictator." However, in order for Mr. Che to understand the actual situation of the country depicted in the play and the human geography of the Indian nation, he has decided to personally conduct an on-site inspection of the country. It is learned that Mr. Zhu has prepared his luggage and is expected to leave for India within a month. In addition to Loren Full, the accompanying team includes several people, including the great director Hinlo Peyhoton. However, his wife, Pauline Goddard, has decided not to travel with him again because the company still has several films that need to be produced urgently.

The ethical family film "The Great Wall" produced by the former China United Film Company, after being released in the United States in 1935, was warmly praised by the people of the country. Recently, due to the request of the majority of American audiences, it was given a second public screening at the Satorer Theatre in New York starting on the 12th of last month. The screening period was originally set for four days, but due to the booming box office, it was extended to eight days. It is also heard that the theater, in view of the fact that China is currently in a period of resistance against the war, has automatically remitted half of the ticket revenue to the Chinese government for use as medical expenses for the wounded soldiers.

Deanna Durbin's seventh work after "First Love," "Spring Parade," has been completed and is expected to be released in China around February.

Clark Gable and his wife Carole Lombard, who had been missing for more than two months, safely returned to Hollywood on the evening of January 14. Major newspapers and weekly magazines have not disclosed the course of their disappearance. It is reported that the reason is that Clark and others are unwilling to report on the mysterious journey.

China's 24th anti-Japanese war news film "The Great Victory of Northern Guangdong" was successively premiered in New York, London, and Paris last month. The film is 1,900 feet long and lasts for 35 minutes. After the film was released, newspapers from various countries unanimously gave it positive reviews.

### Returning from Beyond the Great Wall – Mongolian Photography Memoirs (Part 2)

— Yao Shiquan (Chongqing Aviation News)

At this time, many lamas, both senior and junior, were welcoming us at the "Lamasery Temple," with large lanterns made of white paper hanging everywhere. Seeing this unusual scene in the vast, dark desert, it felt as if we had arrived in another world. Drums were beating loudly, creating a deafening noise. Guards stood in rows, exuding an imposing presence. They ushered us into the temple, where everyone sat cross-legged on large pits padded with velvet carpets, with butter lamps burning on all four walls. In the center of the pit, there was a long seat like a throne in a palace. Group Leader Wei and King Kang sat in the center, while many of us sat on both sides. The atmosphere was extremely solemn. King Kang specially prepared a Mongolian dinner to entertain us, with utensils made of ancient bronze. The walls around us were painted with classical murals, with red pillars, green tiles, and gilded carvings, exuding magnificence everywhere. The antique and elegant atmosphere made us feel as if we had entered another beautiful world...

When I woke up early in the morning, the red sun was already shining through the Mongolian patterned window lattices. Several red-robed lamas came in, carrying a brass pot and several small copper basins. At first, we didn't know what they were for. Later, the old lama who could speak Chinese told us that they were washing utensils. Breakfast was buttered fried rice. One pound of butter was extracted from fifty pounds of cream. This precious cream was specially made for the King. In the morning, King Kang ordered an alarm to be sounded, and the Mongolian strongmen, cavalry, and self-defense forces from all sides quickly gathered in front of the "Lamasery Temple." King Kang began the review, and the photographic work of the past few days was completed very successfully. In the evening, King Kang convened a grand evening party in a large Mongolian yurt. After everyone sang the national anthem together, the entertainment program began. Mongolian female comrades sang anti-Japanese war songs and various Mongolian folk songs. Finally, everyone sang the March of the Volunteers together. After three rounds of wine and eating the whole sheep, King Kang gave a generous and impassioned speech, denouncing the conspiracies and cruelty of Japanese imperialism, hoping that all ethnic groups in the country would not be exploited by the enemy. He stressed the importance of unity under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, completing the great task of resisting the Japanese and building the nation. He also recalled the conspiracy of the Manchu Qing government to poison Mongolia, so he actively advocated abolishing the lama system. All those under the age of forty should return to secular life to become strong men, and the monarchy should be abolished, and the wearing of official hats and robes, and all kneeling ceremonies, should be prohibited... Finally, King Kang smiled at us and said, "Please don't call me King Kang in feudal terms anymore. I am the commander of the anti-Japanese army of the 'Dalate Banner' appointed by the National Government..."

As I embarked on the journey to Qinghai, the memories in my mind made it impossible to forget the photography in Mongolia!

### A Bloody Record of the Golden Palace

— Qi Hua

Handling historical dramas, especially complex ones like "A Bloody Record of the Golden Palace," often results in missing important details or simply being overly verbose in introducing the story without proper editing and careful scripting. Although the director of "A Bloody Record of the Golden Palace" used the clever technique of moving puppets representing those close to the throne to depict the cruel methods of fratricide, nephew killing, and conspiracy to usurp the throne, this trickery cannot hide the flaws in the script, preventing many important scenes from being fully developed and turning them into filler scenes, which is a great pity. As for individual scenes, such as Li Que inciting Edward to imprison John; Li Que's acquisition of Anne; and the murder of Clarence, they are all handled very well.

Basil Rathbone's portrayal of Li Que already benefits from his facial features, and his clever use of his eyes is even more successful. For example, in the three cases mentioned above, when imprisoning John, he raised his head, and his eyes flickered open and closed. When acquiring Anne and begging Edward for forgiveness, his pupils darted and swirled. When drinking with Clarence, his eyes were wooden and motionless. These eye movements all helped to portray Li Que's insidious treachery. The other actors playing Edward IV, Clarence, and Elizabeth are all well-rounded. Karloff, apart from utilizing his facial makeup, did not portray the fierceness of Mute's henchman.

The two war scenes are tightly woven together. War scenes in domestic films are often clueless, especially when using ancient weapons. This should be a good example.

A Certain Female Performer Falls to Her Death (Part 1)

More than a decade ago, many southern female performers gathered at the Old Co-Dance Stage on the French Avenue. At that time, the opera "Hongbi Yuan" was all the rage. A certain female performer played the leading role of Luo Hongxun in the play. Her appearance was beautiful, and her singing style was novel. She was most skilled in singing long passages of the "running board" style. Although she was a female performer, her voice was broad and thick, and she often used soft and charming tones to please the audience. Therefore, at that time, the audience all praised her. The Baidai Company had recorded several of her records, which were popular throughout the country for several years. It is said that no matter what famous performer's records were in the company, none of them sold as well or made as much profit as the records of that certain female performer. Later, the American company Victory set up a factory in Shanghai. After receiving reports from various branches in the north and south, they all said that the sales of a certain female performer's records were high. The Westerners in the company, of course, prioritized business, so they focused on inviting a certain female performer to record. However, at that time, she had retired from the music scene for nearly ten years and did not often interact with outsiders. Later, it was only by inquiring about her old qin master that they learned about her recent difficult situation. If the company could offer a substantial price, she could discuss it with her family. One reason would be to leave more memories, and the second would be to obtain thousands of yuan in income, which would provide some relief to her long-deficient family. After two contacts, the agreement was settled. However, it was the height of summer (normally, recording is best in spring, followed by autumn, and never in summer or winter. However, the company, with its new factory completed, was eager to test the quality of the machines and the technology of the new engineers, so it ventured to do so). The recording studio was filled with sweat, so that each recording had to be re-recorded several times before a pair of wax discs could be selected. One day, only the first section of "Zhanzi" was recorded, and it was already late. It was agreed that she would come early the next day to continue recording the second, third, and fourth sections. But the next day was even hotter. The engineers and others waited in the recording studio from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, but that certain female performer had not yet arrived. Foreigners valued credit the most, and their faces immediately showed displeasure. At the same time, they prepared to put away the machines and wax discs and stop recording. (186)
