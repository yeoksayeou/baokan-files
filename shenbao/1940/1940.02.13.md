### Results of the Counteroffensive by Chinese Forces in Southern Guangxi: Binyang and Jiutang Both Recaptured; Remnants of the Japanese Army Routed and Retreating to Silong, Now Surrounded by Chinese Forces; Japanese Troops Attacking Jiuling in Southern Hubei Province Repelled at Tongcheng

Liuzhou: Since the Chinese forces launched a great annihilation campaign in southern Guangxi, the Japanese troops have been rampaging in the vicinity of Binyang, still attempting to resist stubbornly. However, the Chinese forces have completely recaptured all strongholds south of Binyang, cutting off the Japanese army's retreat route. They have not yet escaped the encirclement and are being fiercely attacked day and night. The number of enemy troops killed is countless, with Japanese corpses strewn all over the mountains and fields, making it difficult to count. On the morning of the 11th, the Chinese armies from all directions, taking advantage of their momentum, tightened their encirclement of Binyang. A portion of the routed Japanese troops retreated to the vicinity of Silong (southwest of Binyang) and are also being closely pursued and encircled for annihilation by the Chinese forces.

### Intense Artillery Battles Near Dongliu

Tunxi: On the 10th, a fierce artillery battle took place on the river surface southwest of Dongliu. At noon, a Japanese medium-sized transport ship was sailing southwest from Dongliu. When the Japanese ship approached within range, the Chinese artillery unit fired upon the ship. Several shells landed on the bow of the ship, and the damaged ship sailed away. In the afternoon, another Japanese medium-sized warship suddenly appeared, escorting a giant transport ship upstream. The Chinese artillery unit, seizing the opportunity, again aimed at the Japanese giant transport ship and bombarded it, scoring multiple hits. The ship sustained heavy damage and was unable to continue sailing, so it stopped for repairs on the north bank. At this time, the Japanese warship fired indiscriminately, but its aim was inaccurate, so the Chinese side suffered no damage. At this time, the Chinese artillery soldiers' enthusiasm for battle increased even more intensely, and they concentrated their firepower, launching a massive bombardment of the Japanese warship. The Japanese warship, unable to withstand the pressure of the Chinese firepower, sailed downstream. (11th dispatch)

Chongqing: According to news from Guiyang obtained here today, Mr. and Mrs. Hayward, British Baptist missionaries from Qin County, Shanxi Province, stated that most of the foreign missionaries in Shanxi Province have now been driven out by the Japanese. The Japanese have repeatedly promoted anti-foreign movements in Shanxi Province, resulting in the violent deaths of two foreign missionaries and the looting of ten church properties. The foreigners who have been expelled from Shanxi are not only British, but also Americans and people of other nationalities. However, the Chinese guerrillas are still carrying out their work of destroying railways and highways, hindering the actions of the Japanese army. According to Hayward, after the fall of Taiyuan, all the Chinese wounded soldiers who remained in Taiyuan and had no time to escape were killed by the Japanese army. He also said that those who remain in Taiyuan now are all poor people, because all the wealthy classes have fled. (February 12th, United Press)

Editorial

### US-Soviet Diplomatic Relations and the Situation in the Far East

Among the undercurrents in international diplomacy today, the most influential on the situation in the Far East is the superficial harmony but real discord between the United States and the Soviet Union. Since the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish War, the United States has sympathized with Finland and condemned the Soviet Union. Politicians who were already antipathetic to the Soviet Union have further fueled the flames, using foreign policy as a tool for their domestic political struggles. First, former Republican President Herbert Hoover and Senator Vandenberg proposed severing relations with the Soviet Union as a campaign platform for the next Republican election. Then, Hull issued a statement that the Soviet Union had not fulfilled the obligations it undertook when the US-Soviet diplomatic relations were restored, and President Roosevelt made statements criticizing the Soviet Union. The undercurrent of anti-Soviet sentiment in the United States, which had been brewing in the opposition party, gradually attracted the attention of the current authorities. Although the main motivation is a domestic political issue, its impact on the world is not so simple. The United States recognized the Soviet Union on November 17, 1933, and the motivation was to eliminate the "abnormal relationship between the 130 million people of the United States and the 160 million people of the Soviet Union." The elimination of this abnormal relationship, as Soviet Chairman Kalinin replied in a letter to President Roosevelt, was "not only detrimental to the interests of the two countries, but also detrimental to the general international situation, because it could increase the factors of unrest, hinder the process of concluding world peace, and stimulate forces that destroy peace." The next day, President Roosevelt also stated in a speech in Savannah that the main motivation for the United States to recognize the Soviet Union was to maintain world peace. Although the meaning of what Roosevelt called world peace was not clear, some people at the time believed that the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union also discussed the most important and most secret issue, namely, the situation in the Far East. This speculation is certainly not without reason. The Stimson Doctrine after the September 18th Incident failed because it could not obtain the support of those with important interests in the Far East at that time. Britain and France certainly bear part of the responsibility, but the exclusion of the Soviet Union, another important country at the time, from the international arena was also an important reason why Japan dared to launch the war. After the United States recognized the Soviet Union, the situation in the Far East should have improved, but because the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations while the United States did not, and because the United States was the initiator of the Nine-Power Treaty while the Soviet Union was not a member state, when the Nine-Power Treaty countries met in Beijing, although both the United States and the Soviet Union attended, the outcome of the Nine-Power Treaty meeting only passed resolutions for each country to individually aid China. And in fact, only one or two countries have enhanced China's resistance strength in economic and material terms. As for close cooperation to jointly deal with aggressors, it is still lacking. In the meantime, due to differences in political systems, inconsistencies in interests, mutual friction, and mutual exclusion, which have further facilitated the aggressor, there have been many such instances. After the outbreak of the Second European War, although the United States remained neutral, not taking sides with either of the belligerents, the passage of the new neutrality law, both in spirit and in substance, favored the Western European democratic countries. As a result, the emotion of loathing Germany in terms of ideology and opposing the Soviet Union in terms of policy also erupted, reflecting in the policies of those in power. But judging from the current situation, the US policy toward the Soviet Union will not undergo any major changes. If the US-Soviet relationship were to deteriorate when the Western European democratic countries are in trouble in Europe, then its position in China would inevitably be further weakened. The United States is the most powerful country for maintaining its traditional policy in China, and the Soviet Union is also an important stronghold for supporting China's resistance. If American politicians abandon their prejudices, are not swayed by the emotions of a small number of people, dispel their fears of countries that sympathize with China, and cooperate with friendly countries that have interests in China, then the situation in the Far East may perhaps usher in a new phase.

### Prominent Figures from All Sectors in the United States Request the Government to Impose Punitive Taxes on Japan; Senator Norris Advocates Boycotting Japanese and Soviet Goods; Loan Bill to China to be Voted on in the Senate Today

New York: According to news here today, fifty American educators, along with numerous pastors and political figures (including President Roosevelt's mother), jointly sent a telegram to President Roosevelt today, urging him to promptly revoke the most-favored-nation treatment for Japan, end the US assistance to Japan's aggression, and impose punitive taxes on Japan in accordance with the Tariff Act of 1930, expressing the American people's anger and condemnation of Japan's illegal aggression against China. (February 12th, United Press)

Washington: Independent Senator Norris told a reporter from the US Associated Press today that he advocates a moral embargo and boycott of Japan, the Soviet Union, and any barbaric country, through people's automatic boycott of Japanese and Soviet goods, and at the same time stopping the sale of goods to them. As long as the government does not participate in the action, it will not constitute an unfriendly act. However, Norris does not advocate authorizing the president to implement economic sanctions against Japan, as this type of action could involve the United States in war. (February 12th, United Press)

Washington: According to an investigation by a reporter from the US Associated Press today, various draft resolutions regarding the implementation of economic sanctions against Japan will likely be temporarily shelved, because the majority of senators on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee believe that Japan should be given sufficient time to demonstrate whether it respects US rights and interests. However, the issue of a $20 million loan to China and a loan to Finland will be voted on in the Senate at 5:00 PM tomorrow. It is said that although there will be 30 opposing votes, passage is almost certain. According to an investigation by the Associated Press reporter, among the 23 members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 12 do not advocate implementing an export embargo against Japan immediately. However, if Japan greatly offends the US, some of these members advocate implementing economic sanctions immediately. In addition, seven members, including Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman, advocate implementing sanctions against Japan. Another four members, including Vandenberg, have not yet made up their minds. According to Democratic Senator Minton, loans to China and Finland are most appropriate. According to Senator Thomas, an embargo should not be targeted at Japan alone, as this would force Japan into the arms of the Soviet Union and allow the Soviet Union to do as it pleases in Europe. However, most believe that if the government wants Congress to pass this embargo plan, it will not be too difficult, and President Roosevelt has tariff power and can use it to punish Japan.

### The Netherlands and Japan: Arbitration Treaty - Japan Announces its Abolition; Proposes Renewal with a New Treaty

The Hague: An official statement recently announced that since Japan withdrew from the League of Nations and the International Court of Arbitration, the arbitration and conciliation treaty signed between that country and the Netherlands on April 19, 1933, has certain provisions related to the International Court of Arbitration and is no longer fully applicable. The Japanese government, therefore, in accordance with the treaty, announced the abolition of one item six months in advance, and formally notified the Dutch government of its intention to abolish it. For this reason, this treaty will expire on August 12 of this year. The Japanese ambassador to the Netherlands expressed hope that the governments of both countries could conduct talks in the shortest possible time in order to draft a new treaty based on the current situation and adjust some technical issues. The Dutch government also hopes that the new treaty can be signed and established before the current treaty expires. (February 12th, Havas)

### Franco-Japanese Trade Agreement to Expire Next Month; Negotiations for a New Trade Agreement Stalled

Paris: News last night from here states that negotiations for a new Franco-Japanese trade agreement have stalled. France intends to allow the Franco-Japanese trade agreement, which expires on March 15, to lapse. There are two reasons for the stall in negotiations for a new trade agreement: (1) France is retaliating against Japan's ban on the import of French luxury goods by banning the export of military raw materials to Japan; (2) Japan has failed to satisfactorily explain the Japanese plane bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to France, which is another factor in the stalling of negotiations. Since the outbreak of the European War, Franco-Japanese trade has almost stopped, with only a small amount of Vietnamese coal, rice, and iron sold to Japan in exchange for raw silk, camphor, and canned fish.

### Japan Plans to Obtain War Materials from South America; Naval Exercises Intended for This Purpose; US Government Already Paying Close Attention

Washington: Senior US government officials stated last night that the US government is closely monitoring the recent exercises conducted by the Japanese navy. The purpose of these exercises seems to be to enable Japan to obtain major war materials from other countries in the event that the United States imposes a ban on the shipment of military raw materials. It is reported that Japan is currently conducting negotiations with Mexico, Colombia, and Peru, hoping to obtain oil from each of these countries if the United States ever announces an embargo. However, the scope of the meeting is not yet known. However, it is believed here that Japan will not have any obstacles in obtaining oil from these countries. However, its only difficulty is that these countries lack fixed dock facilities along the Pacific coast. However, Japan has a very sufficient number of lighters that can carry the oil to China to meet the needs of the Japanese army fighting in China. (February 12th, United Press)

### Hata Shunroku in an Awkward Situation in the Japanese House of Representatives Budget Committee; Claims Military Secrets and Refuses to Explain the Budget Plan; Representative Makino Denounces Him as a Coward; A Disturbance Ensues in Response

Tokyo: In the House of Representatives Budget Committee today, Representative Makino Saburo believed that Land Minister Hata Shunroku's attitude was inappropriate because he could not provide a full explanation of the 1,350,000,000 yen requested in the army's ordinary budget plan. Hata Shunroku immediately retorted, claiming that this was a military secret and could not be easily disclosed. Makino immediately shouted "Coward!", and the representatives on the seats all spoke up for Makino, causing a disturbance in the meeting hall for a while. However, there is no official record of this point. (February 12th, United Press)

Chongqing: According to opinions from various Chinese circles here, the budget proposal for 1940-41 passed by the Japanese House of Representatives Budget Committee on February 3, totaling 10,360,000,000 yen, is actually a huge castle in the air and cannot be implemented. The hasty passage of the budget proposal was because the members of Congress knew that it was a kind of deception and could not be questioned. (February 12th, Reuters)

### Chinese Prisoners of War to be Transported to Japan to Serve as Laborers; The Japanese Military is Considering

At other times, only nine Japanese aircraft were found flying along the Yuehan Road. (February 12th, Reuters)

### US President Concerned About European Situation: Not Abandoning Opportunities for Peace. Welles' Visit Focuses on Germany; Britain to Offer Views on Far East Policy.

London - Diplomatic circles here recently commented on US Undersecretary of State Welles' inspection tour of Europe, all wondering why President Roosevelt made such a move at this juncture. Most believe the President's intention is to once again express that he will not let slip any opportunity to seek peace in the European war. Furthermore, observers believe the simultaneous dispatch of President Roosevelt's personal representative to the Vatican, Myron C. Taylor, to Italy with Welles is of great significance. The Vatican is currently one of the most well-informed centers in Europe, making it a suitable location for investigations or gathering information. In short, observers here sympathize with President Roosevelt's initiative, but because they are not fully aware of the true mission of Welles' trip, they are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. (Havas, 11th)

Washington - Newspapers and observers continue to comment on Undersecretary of State Welles' consultations in Europe. Most believe the primary motivations are twofold: one is an attempt at a strategy to restore peace in Europe, and the other is to assess the situation to gain a greater understanding. Considering the French Chamber of Deputies' unanimous vote of confidence in the Daladier cabinet, the comments made by British and French authorities on Welles' trip, and the recent speech by German Interior Minister Frick, it is evident that the belligerent nations currently have no intention of ceasing hostilities. White House insiders said that President Roosevelt has never had any illusions about this. At the same time, a senior diplomat close to the President yesterday provided a firm guarantee to an ambassador of a belligerent nation (referring to either Britain or France), stating that Welles' trip, in any case, should not cause Britain or France to feel uneasy or raise doubts. Furthermore, experienced observers say that the true goal of Welles' trip is to consult with Germany, as the US authorities have a deep understanding of the British and French perspectives and there is no need for investigation. Regarding the situation in Germany, the information received here is contradictory. It is rumored that a certain important figure in that country recently sent a representative to the United States, attempting to persuade President Roosevelt to mediate. Although the President did not accept, this led to the decision to send a high-ranking official to Europe to conduct an on-site investigation to determine the true motives behind this German activity. As for the talks between the United States and various neutral European countries, the sole purpose is to probe the true intentions of these countries and encourage them to adopt the economic principles advocated by Secretary of State Hull as soon as possible. According to the State Department, if a lasting peace is to be established after the war, there is no other way but for all countries in the world to unanimously accept these principles. (Havas, 11th)

London - Regarding US Undersecretary of State Welles' trip to Europe, diplomatic circles here recently stated that various rumors have been spreading in the United States lately, often misunderstanding the policies pursued by Britain and France in the Far East. Therefore, the Far East issue is one of the topics that the British government is willing to discuss with Welles after his arrival in Europe. For example, news recently emerged in the United States claiming that Britain and Japan have already formed an agreement, and Britain has recognized the Japanese military's campaign in China, as well as Japan's economic and financial influence in China. Although it is believed here that responsible US officials may not take such rumors seriously, since Welles will be coming to Europe, it would be beneficial for the British authorities to take this opportunity to exchange views on Far East policy with him. (Havas, 12th)

### Germany Eager to Avoid Premature Excitement

Amsterdam - German newspapers have not yet mentioned US Undersecretary of State Welles' plan to come to Europe to discuss peace issues with various neutral countries, only publishing a brief message from the official news agency regarding Welles' European tour. According to neutral country correspondents, the initial reaction from German officials to this matter was better than expected, but they quickly fell silent, as if Germany should not express an enthusiasm for a possible peace opportunity that it should not show. Neutral country observers in Berlin generally have the impression that Germany is eager to avoid showing premature excitement, lest it be seen as a sign of internal weakness in Germany. Outwardly, if Welles comes to Germany, Germany will give him a very polite but not overly expressive reception. (Reuters, 12th)

### France Believes German Spring Offensive Can Be Delayed

Paris - Officials here announced last night that Roosevelt's peace movement may delay the German army's "spring offensive" on the Western Front. They believe that Germany will not start a major offensive on the Western Front until US Undersecretary of State Welles arrives in Berlin. (United Press, 12th)

Paris - The "Le Matin" newspaper recently published an editorial commenting on US Undersecretary of State Welles' trip to Europe, stating that France has nothing to hide, nothing to compensate for, and no nation or race that needs to be liberated due to French servitude. It is hoped that Undersecretary Welles' trip will not only go to Berlin, but also to Vienna, Prague, and especially Warsaw. The "L'œuvre" newspaper reported that Undersecretary Welles' trip is purely exploratory in nature. "Le Populaire" also stated that Undersecretary Welles may not offer any suggestions, nor will he be in contact with European countries on behalf of the US government, but this move is enough to show the United States' increasing concern for European affairs and can further weaken the isolationist forces in that country. (Havas, 12th)

### Belgium Expresses Support for US Peace Movement

Beijing - Regarding the discussions between US Secretary of State Hull and various neutral countries on economic cooperation and peace issues, the official gazette here announced last night that Belgian officials expressed strong support for it, as this initiative is in line with the Belgian government's views. Newspapers pointed out that the talks conducted by US Secretary of State Hull and the visit by Undersecretary of State Welles are interrelated and, under certain circumstances, may form a conference of neutral countries. (Haitong, 12th)

### Soviet Newspapers Did Not Publish Roosevelt's Speech

Moscow - Unofficial sources here believe that the current US efforts to restore peace in Europe will inevitably fail. Furthermore, Roosevelt's speech criticizing the Soviet Union was not published in any newspapers here. As for the official position, it is believed that criticism will be withheld until official documents of Roosevelt's speech are received. According to unofficial sources, the Soviet Union views Britain and France as aggressors, as Germany requested peace after the outbreak of the war but was rejected by Britain and France. The Soviet Union absolutely supports Germany's previous peace proposals. (United Press, 12th)

### Britain and France Determined to Resist Any Aggression; Will Study Aid to Finland with Welles; Simultaneously Defending Against Soviet Reaction in the Near East

London - Diplomatic circles here recently announced that US Undersecretary of State Welles' inspection tour of Europe and the US government's talks with various neutral countries are related to the desire for peace expressed by various countries. Even if President Roosevelt is not yet prepared to propose a peace plan, it is clear that his initiative is aimed at peace. Britain and France's determination to resist aggression is now stronger than ever, not only against German aggression but also against aggression from any direction. Their strength to resist is also greater than before. Regarding the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland, the British and French governments will certainly be willing to study the issue of aiding Finland with Undersecretary Welles, and to adjust the British and French aid steps, as well as the aid that the United States can give to Finland without violating neutrality, to some extent. Regarding this, Prime Minister Chamberlain made a statement in the House of Commons, meaning that Britain should provide Finland with aid in other ways in addition to expanding material assistance, that is, sending volunteer soldiers to Finland to help in the war. The French government will also do the same. The British and French governments are also afraid that the Soviet Union may have a strong reaction, and have taken various measures in all aspects, especially in the Near East, as a precautionary measure. Soviet figures in London are all feeling anxious about the intentions of the British and French governments, and are worried that these countries may sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, but still firmly believe that the Soviet Union will continue to fight Finland. If so, Britain and France are likely to have entanglements with the Soviet Union in the Near East. As for the Balkan Peninsula, the decisions made recently at the meeting of the Balkan Entente countries have fully expressed their united relationship, and its nature is no different from the establishment of a mutual assistance agreement. If the Soviet Union takes any action in this corner of Europe, Britain and France are prepared to provide material assistance to the Entente countries to maintain their neutral status. (Havas, 12th)

### Finnish Foreign Minister's Statement: No Request for Armistice; Fierce Fighting in the Karelian Isthmus; Soviets Claim to Have Captured Sixteen Forts

Helsinki - Foreign Minister Tanner recently gave a statement to the press, stating, "Foreign newspapers have recently reported that a certain great power intends to mediate the war between Finland and the Soviet Union. I hereby solemnly declare that our government has not requested any country to mediate, and we have no knowledge of such rumors. Our troops have been fighting for more than two months to defend their homeland. Although the enemy's strength is greater, our army has always dealt with them with our own manpower and resources, and has been quite successful. To this day, the majority of countries have been able to implement the League of Nations resolution and provide us with assistance in terms of armaments and manpower. With this, our country will be able to repel all attacks. For this reason, no one can force our country to accept peace terms with dictatorial commands. The various rumors spread are mostly rumors spread by the enemy, intending to reduce the assistance given to our country by various countries." (Havas, 11th)

Moscow - According to a communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, front-line reconnaissance teams were very active on the 11th, and the artillery battles were very fierce in several areas. At the same time, north of Lake Ladoga, small infantry units from both sides continued to clash. In the Karelian area, the infantry of both sides came into contact and engaged in artillery battles. As a result, the enemy was repelled, and the Soviet advancing forces captured sixteen forts, including eight strong artillery batteries. The Soviet air force conducted reconnaissance flights and bombed enemy military targets. (TASS, 12th)

Helsinki - A recent Finnish communiqué stated, "The Soviet army continued to attack the Karelian Isthmus on Saturday and Sunday, with artillery units fiercely bombarding various locations. On that day, the Finnish army destroyed five Soviet tanks and destroyed a Soviet transportation convoy of seventy carriages northeast of Lake Ladoga. The Finnish air force engaged in defensive and reconnaissance flights and bombed enemy barracks. Enemy aircraft bombed Viipuri, killing and injuring several civilians. Two Soviet aircraft were shot down." (Reuters, 12th)

### Death of Tweedsmuir; Remains to Be Given State Funeral Tomorrow

Montreal - Canadian Governor-General Lord Tweedsmuir passed away here late yesterday. On the 6th of this month, Tweedsmuir suddenly fainted on the steps of the Governor-General's residence, losing consciousness for an hour. In the next two days, he underwent surgery twice, and his condition improved slightly. However, on the 11th, five doctors issued a formal report stating that his condition worsened again around 11:00 AM. It was planned to perform a third surgery and blood transfusion, but it was too late to save him, and he passed away that night. He was born in August 1875 and was 66 years old. He was a Scotsman, originally named Buchan, studied at Oxford, studied law, and was skilled in literature. He began writing at the age of 21 and continued for nearly 40 years. His writing was lively and full of humor. His most popular work was "The Thirty-Nine Steps," which was adapted into a film by the British film industry and became very popular. In addition to novels, Tweedsmuir also wrote "A History of the Great War," "A Life of Cromwell," etc. Tweedsmuir's sister, wife, and daughters were all well-known in the literary world and had their own works. Therefore, it was said that a family was a gathering place for writers. In 1901, Tweedsmuir went to South Africa as the private secretary to Milner, an official. During the European war, he worked in the British military headquarters in France, and later served as the head of intelligence for the Prime Minister's office. In 1927, he entered the House of Commons, and in 1935, he was appointed Governor-General of Canada and granted the title of Baron. Although Tweedsmuir was a literary figure, he had political talent and has been loved by Canadians since taking office. (Reuters, 12th)

Montreal - The Canadian government has scheduled the 7th as a day of public mourning. Canadian Prime Minister King has announced that a state funeral will be held in Ottawa on Wednesday, and said that Lord Tweedsmuir's remains will be transported back to Britain for burial. (Reuters, 12th)

### Anglo-Turkish Commercial Treaty; Full Text Published; Valid for One Year

London - The full text of the Anglo-Turkish Commercial Treaty, signed here on February 3, was published today as a white paper. The treaty came into effect on February 19 and expires on March 31, 1941. If neither party gives notice of termination three months in advance, it will continue to be valid for one year. The treaty stipulates that all goods exported from Britain to Turkey and from Turkey to Britain shall be subject to compensatory trade. The value of British exports to compensate for Turkish goods shall not exceed 80% of the value of Turkish exports to compensate for goods. (Reuters, 12th)

### Suma Discusses Japanese-Soviet Relations; Proves that Negotiations on Outstanding Issues Have Made No Progress to Date

Tokyo - Today, Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma told reporters that the Soviet Union has accepted the principles and drafts proposed by Japan for the demarcation and handling of border disputes between the two committees. However, negotiations on all the details have not yet reached the final stage. Since the breakdown of the Harbin Conference on January 31, the Soviet-Japanese-Mongolian-"Manchukuo" parties agreed on February 2 to organize two general committees to deal with the issues of the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian border. The first committee will negotiate general demarcation issues, and the other committee will handle border disputes. Suma also mentioned the situation of the Japanese delegation currently negotiating with the Soviet authorities in Moscow, saying that there has been great progress in a certain subcommittee, and the main committee meeting is scheduled to be convened tomorrow. (Reuters, 12th)

### Romania Strengthens Military Preparations to Maintain National Independence; Utilizes Natural Barriers on Eastern and Western Borders to Build Strong Defensive Fortifications

Bucharest - According to well-informed sources, the Romanian government, in view of the fact that Germany and the Soviet Union are colluding in Europe and are becoming increasingly menacing, is building defensive lines on the western border with Hungary and Germany, and on the eastern border with the Soviet Union, as examples of the French Maginot Line and the Czechoslovakian Schroeder Line, making full use of natural barriers. In order to raise construction funds and increase the strength of the army, the government has issued military bonds. To date, it has raised more than 10 billion lei. In addition, special taxes are levied on certain export goods, and the proceeds will be used to strengthen military preparations. According to political figures, although Romania is actively expanding its military preparations, it has no intention of aggression. What it seeks is nothing more than maintaining its national independence and territorial integrity. As for the political aspect, the united relationship between the Balkan Entente countries has been clearly demonstrated after the meeting of the permanent political conference of the countries in the capital of Yugoslavia. Romania can use this as a backing to promote relations with its neighbors, especially Bulgaria. (Havas, 11th)

### On the So-Called "New Regime"

— (Tao Xisheng)

Minai and Arita in the Japanese Diet declared that their policy towards China would still be to fully support the so-called "regime in power." I now want to tell Minai, Arita, and the Japanese people what this "regime in power" is. I also hope that our Chinese compatriots clearly understand the content of this so-called "new regime." If the people of China and Japan want to achieve true peace, they must kick aside the so-called "Outline for Adjusting the New Sino-Japanese Relationship" and the so-called new central government established under these conditions.

(I)

No matter how the content of the Japanese-imposed agreements is modified and embellished in words, to put it simply and bluntly: Japan wants to annex Manchuria and Inner Mongolia, monopolize North China, blockade Central China, and control South China. In other words, Japan's entire ambition toward China extends from the Heilongjiang River in the north to Hainan Island in the south, reaching the climate in the sky above and the mineral resources in the ground below. Centrally, from east to northwest, from territorial waters to inland rivers, they want to occupy and control everything. From one perspective, Japan wants to use Inner Mongolia to control North China, North China to control Central China, and Central China to control South China. From another perspective, they want to transform South China into Central China, Central China into North China, North China into Inner Mongolia, Inner Mongolia into Manchuria, and Manchuria into Korea. Regarding the powers on the Pacific, Japan uses the Great Wall Line, the Zhengtai Railway, the Jiaoji Railway, and even the Longhai Railway as the three lines of defense for its war against Russia, stationing Japanese troops there. They also occupy Hainan Island, Sanzao Island, Dongsha Island, Xisha Island, Nanpeng Island, Dapeng Bay, and Xiamen as naval bases to control Guangdong and Fujian, encircle Hong Kong, pressure Guangzhou Bay, confront sea defenses and Singapore, and spy on the Philippines. As for economic means, they use methods of monopolization, joint ventures, and cooperation for Chinese resources and various enterprises, regardless of whether the Chinese people are willing or not, to exert comprehensive control. Their economic power does not come from Japan; their method is to scour Chinese fiscal revenue to invest in various Japanese enterprises in China.

In terms of ideology, Japan fears that the Chinese people will feel the pain of being exploited and will eventually resist. Therefore, they impose control over culture and education, wanting to thoroughly rule the Chinese people from physiology to psychology. The Japanese side has already presented all its demands on China through Mr. Wang Zhaoming. They are still afraid that these demands, compared to the "facts" that Japanese troops and special agents have already created or will create before and after today, might encounter some concessions. Therefore, at the beginning of the "Outline," they solemnly declared two points: The first point is that ordinary established facts should be gradually adjusted according to the principles set forth in the "Outline." The second point is that special situations must be adjusted further according to the development of the situation until peace is restored. This means that if the "established facts" should concede according to the principles, the Japanese side will still insist on the "established facts" not being changed, and at most, they can only slowly adjust the ordinary facts. In addition to these two principles, the annex repeatedly states that "established facts" should be inherited or continued. Therefore, the so-called "Outline," even after many days of negotiations and signing of agreements, is still a false document. The Japanese intention is nothing more than to have the "Wang regime" recognize the established facts and turn them into treaties and domestic laws. On January 3rd, when I left Shanghai, I left a letter to Mr. Wang, saying: "Today's establishment of the government only turns the conditions of inequality, non-independence, and lack of freedom into law, and only turns the established fact of national subjugation into conditions. What other meaning is there?" These few words pinpoint the insidious intention of Japan in proposing the so-called "Outline" and promoting Mr. Wang's "establishment of the government."

(II)

Japanese soldiers cannot find a way to end the Sino-Japanese War. To deceive the Japanese people, they create a "central government" and conclude a peace treaty with it. Japan still has no new means different from their creation of "Manchukuo." Mr. Wang, under their means, is just another Puyi. Zhou Fohai once said to me in April last year: "Japan wants a Puyi from me, and there is no better Puyi than Mr. Wang." In other words, the Japanese military has no magnanimity to allow the so-called "regime in power" to have the power of self-preservation, let alone the ability to execute the peace treaty. On the one hand, they promote the so-called "establishment of a new central government" every day; on the other hand, they strengthen the specialization of North China, strengthen the organization of the "Hubei Provincial Government," strengthen the "Guangzhou Maintenance Association," and "guarantee" the personnel and affairs of the "Renovation Government," not allowing changes. They must ensure that Mr. Wang, as soon as he takes office, is still an empty person with bare hands, without power, without strength, and without room to obtain the slightest convenience or preference granted by the "Outline." If there is any convenience or preference, a government has two real material foundations: one is economic finance, and the other is military power. Where is the economic and financial foundation of the so-called "new central government"? The economic administration of North China is presided over by the so-called "North China Political Affairs Commission" to facilitate easy disposal. The economic enterprises of North China are controlled by monopolistic organizations like the North China Development Company. The "new regime" cannot interfere at all. The economic administration of Central China is influenced by the "Sino-Japanese Economic Agreement Organization," and the economic enterprises are controlled by monopolistic organizations like the Central China Development Company, leaving no economic power for the Chinese people. As for financial and monetary policies, they all require Japanese "assistance" and cannot be independently determined. Customs, salt, and unified taxes in North China are stipulated to be entirely or largely allocated to the North China Political Affairs Commission as Japanese investments in North China. The financial revenue of Central China is now entirely in the hands of the Japanese. The "new regime" can only use a small amount returned in the form of loans after fulfilling its promises and agreeing to many conditions. According to what I personally know up to noon on January 3rd when I boarded the ship, the new dedication of the "new" Minister of Finance of the "New Central" was nothing more than hoping that the Japanese would return the remaining customs revenue of 40 million yuan. The Japanese also said that the remaining customs revenue was not much, and he had to request a loan of 50 million yuan from the Japanese. In fact, the loan is still taking the wool from the sheep, but all financial resources are in the hands of the Japanese. Besides relying on their breath, the "new regime" cannot even open. As for what to live on after opening, that depends on the boundless magical power of the Japanese financial advisor, whom the "new finance minister" had already happily agreed to invite last May. Speaking of military power, when Mr. Wang first left Chongqing, according to Mei Shiping's report, the Japanese allowed the allocation of military equipment, allowing Mr. Wang to train an army of forty divisions. Later, Mr. Wang and his cadres never heard the Japanese say anything so generous again. Last September, Wang Kemin told a cadre of Mr. Wang that "when the Japanese invited us to come out at the beginning, they also promised that we could train ten divisions of troops, but after taking office, this promise disappeared." The pitiful so-called "Central Military Officer Corps," which they considered to be the basic force that could unify China, only managed to recruit a batch with great difficulty, and there was no second batch to recruit. Their guns were not issued, and their uniforms were not allowed to be worn out of the corps headquarters; their Blue Sky White Sun flag was not allowed to be raised, and their Blue Sky White Sun badges were made and locked in boxes, not allowed to be worn; their training equipment only included rifles, and even small cannons with a two-inch caliber were not allowed to be seen by the corps members; all corps affairs were subject to the control of a Japanese major instructor; and the lieutenant general education director had to bow down to this major's whims every day. This is still a "military training institution" that "receives friendly assistance and is grateful." If we talk about the so-called First Army Corps, even rifles are rare treasures, and its controllers are Japanese "military police of the rank of sergeant." Everyone knows that sergeants are of the same rank as Chinese master sergeants. In the future, after the establishment of the "New Central," the defense and security will still rely on the Japanese army and military police. Unless one can wholeheartedly regard the Japanese army as one's own army and the Japanese military police as one's own guards, who can deny that this government is a government under Japanese guns? Ren Yuandao originally had several thousand guards, and Chen Qun also had some police. Because they wanted to be Minister of Military Affairs and Minister of the Interior, they were once obstructed by Zhou Fohai. They became disaffected. When Mr. Wang entered Nanjing, he had no choice but to ask the Japanese military police for advice.

Japan allows the withdrawal of troops within two years after the restoration of peace and the establishment of security. Assuming that the "New Central" is established and peace is deemed to be restored in one year, and security is deemed to be established in two years, then this "New Central" has been guarded by the Japanese army for as long as three years. Moreover, Japan demands that Nanjing be one of the garrison locations for maintaining security. This "New Central" will become an "Old Central" in another three years and will not be able to leave the Japanese military police. What "independence and freedom" can be talked about under the "government" held hostage by the Japanese military police? Isn't this deceiving ancestors and deceiving descendants? The current administrative reality of the "Provisional" and "Renovation" governments can serve as our reference. The "government" cannot command the provincial government, the provincial government cannot command the county government, the upper-level organs cannot command the lower-level organs, and even the superiors cannot control their subordinates. Japanese special organs at all levels have connections and regulations, but Chinese people have no connections and no control. If there is one Japanese person in a section, the section is under their command. If there is one Japanese official in a department, the department is controlled by them. The Japanese are nominally called advisors, liaison officers, or whatever, it doesn't matter. The so-called "New Central" is nothing more than an expansion of the "Renovation Government" and cannot reform this reality at all, especially since there are various Japanese advisors and staff above them. The homes of responsible officials are stationed with Japanese military police, and every step they take requires military police to accompany them. When they arrive in Shanghai, they can only live in Hongkou. If this official wants to go to the French Concession of the Public Concession, the military police must know. Every night, the military police make three copies of his words and deeds, one to the military police headquarters, one to the special service agency, and one to the military command. Important officials always have sons or close relatives "studying" in Japan. Although my two old friends of more than ten years have not yet gone to Nanjing to serve as ministers, their sons have already been accompanied by a Japanese second lieutenant in Tokyo. They believe that the Japanese treat their children well, treating them like "princes." They do not know that the children of many important people in Peiping and Nanjing are also in Tokyo as hostages.

(III)

The establishment of such a government under such conditions is harmful to China and also useless to Japan. I will now explain why Japan does not receive any real benefits from this. According to common sense of the people, political common sense, and diplomatic common sense, Japan only has two paths regarding China: one path is complete conquest, and the other path is timely reconciliation. It is impossible for Japan to conquer all of China. They want to station troops and appoint officials from the Heilongjiang River in the north to Hainan Island in the south, from the East China Sea in the east to Tibet in the west. Regardless of whether they have sufficient national power now, even if they exhaust their national power and barely manage to do it, what power will they have to compete with the great powers in the world? Isn't this very clear? Japan understands that it cannot conquer China. Japan is filled with demands to "end the incident." The Japanese people eagerly hope that the Sino-Japanese War will stop and be resolved as soon as possible. They passively want to save greater and more consumption that Japanese national power cannot support. They actively want to take advantage of the fact that the European war has not stopped today to end the Sino-Japanese incident, develop foreign trade, and expand foreign markets. This urgent demand has caused all parties in the Japanese government and public to change their perceptions over the past two and a half years. Japanese political parties, the business community, and even the control factions of the navy and army are all affected by this urgent demand. The question before them is: Should they prolong the war or end the war? Of course, they all want to end the war and do not want to prolong the war. The "January 16th Declaration" and the "Konoe Statement" are gradually losing interest in Japan, and no one is paying attention to them. Can the "Wang regime in power" end the incident? This easily understood question is gradually being understood by people in Japan. It is very clear that the "Wang regime" cannot issue a single effective order to stop the combat actions of any division or regiment of the Chinese army. How can such a "government" discuss ending the war with the Japanese government? From the Japanese perspective, the "Wang regime" not only cannot help Japan reduce one division or withdraw one regiment of troops but also becomes a burdensome and redundant burden for Japan. The Japanese have always valued money. Before the Wang faction took office, Japan had to provide activity funds, and many Japanese people said it was "uneconomical." Some Japanese people also said that "money is not used properly." When they take office, it is difficult to open without Japanese loans. Walking requires the Japanese to prepare planes, vehicles, and ships. Going out requires the Japanese to deploy sentry posts. Living requires them to occupy houses and vacate houses. Why are the Japanese serving them like this? They just want the Wang faction to recruit troops and find celebrities. To this day, there is not a single troop, and not a single celebrity. Those who have come are generally lazy—lazy because their conscience has not been extinguished, and they are constantly disintegrating—disintegrating due to the mobilization of national conscience. Such a group, after forming a "government," does not even have the ability to exist on its own. How can it have the power to end the Sino-Japanese War? Isn't Japan clearly aware that if they fully support this "new regime," it will only prolong the war? Therefore, in September and October last year, a strong "Wang regime is unnecessary" theory appeared in Japanese society. Since January of this year, Japanese public opinion has changed from praising Wang to despising him. If Japan really wants to prolong the war, then fight on. There is no need for any puppet, let alone a "new central government." If Japan really wants to end the war, any puppet is not only useless but also obstructive. The "New Central" is not more useful than the "Provisional" or "Renovation" governments. Now, the Japanese military has already blown the trumpet, and it is not good to form a "government," and it is not good not to form a "government." Japan's helplessness towards the "New Central" is reflected in the life and death of Mr. Wang and his group in West Shanghai. However, why does the Itagaki faction, especially Kagesa under Itagaki, want Mr. Wang to take office? They entered the market at the time of the Konoe statement, copied the topic, and now, whether they have a black paper or a white paper, they cannot avoid handing in the paper. Although the paper must be handed in, the date is a problem. If handing in the paper hinders Japanese diplomacy or harms the prospects for peace, they can only postpone it. October 10th, November 12th, and January 1st of this year were all the dates set by Kagesa and Zhou Fohai for handing in the paper, but what will happen on February 22nd of this year is still only known to God. Kagesa, as the director of the "New Regime," certainly cannot open his mouth and tell them to postpone it. He can only use Kita and Harada to prompt Wang Liang to create obstacles. Anyone can see this fact now. The only people who don't understand are Wang, Zhou, and Mei. Apart from the Itagaki faction, the Japanese on all sides know that this paper has not yet been handed in and is already useless. To end the incident, they are secretly looking for other ways. Someone in the General Staff Headquarters who took over Kagesa's position told people: "The Wang faction is very easy to deal with. The 'New Government' is not a problem, but to solve the China problem, we need to find other ways." The person who heard this sentence quickly told me, but I don't want to tell Mr. Wang because he doesn't understand the true state of mind of the Japanese. Under Itagaki, Kagesa always fully supports the "Wang regime," right? But Kagesa is not prepared to commit suicide if the Wang faction fails. He is also preparing a second paper. He is creating a youth group to oppose the Wang faction. Someone in his organization is supporting Chen Zhongfu's "New League" to create difficulties for the Wang faction. Zhou Fohai asked him why he helped Chen Zhongfu, and Kagesa replied, "He is confused." Just as Zhou asked Kagesa, "Why did Kita and Harada ask Wang Liang to oppose the Central Political Committee last night?" Kagesa replied, "Kita and Harada were drunk last night." Zhou believed it, and Mr. Wang would also believe it. All parties in Japan are looking for other ways, but other ways cannot be found for the time being. Japan wants to end the war on the one hand, and is unwilling to give up its policy of aggression and dreams of conquest on the other hand. The result is only creating its own dream world, pointing to someone as the Chinese regime, and concluding a peace treaty with them that contains all the ideals of the Japanese military, calling it the "Outline for Adjusting the New Sino-Japanese Relationship." They hand in this paper first, and then hand in other papers later. It's a pity that Mr. Wang's entire political life and natural freedom have all been handed in with this paper.

(IV)

Under such forced and shameless circumstances, do Mr. Zhou and Mr. Mei, and even Mr. and Mrs. Wang, still have a high interest in going to Nanjing to establish their so-called "National Government"? I am very heartbroken and say very frankly: "Their interest is not high, especially Mr. Wang's interest is very low." Between China and Japan, the life-and-death struggle of ethnic nations is continuing. In the national struggle, whether it is war or peace, we must protect our strict defenses and strong陣容. Behind the national defenses, war can be sustained, and peace can be equal. For the sake of the national defenses, we must maintain our military strength, maintain our economic strength, and maintain our independent political position and the political ideals of the ethnic nation. Therefore, "If there is war, there must be total war; if there is peace, there must be total peace." If one person or one faction loses the national defenses, it will not only harm the ethnic nation but also eventually become a victim in the national struggle. The country will never have any sympathy for such a sacrifice. The mistake of Mr. Wang and Mr. Zhou and Mr. Mei is that they have lost the national defenses. They have entered the rear of the Japanese army and military police, wanting to negotiate peace with the □ soldiers in the □ camp, and imagining that they can obtain conditions of independence and freedom and establish an independent and free "government." A moment of thought has led to an irreparable situation.

Due to a moment of thought, various abnormal changes occur in the state of mind. In the four months of life-and-death life, I have observed the psychology of their group and sometimes wrote down some notes. The next paragraph is about the composition of puppets: "In the beginning, they feel that the Japanese are easy to get along with, then they feel that the Japanese are friendly, and in the end, they begin to discover that the Japanese are fearsome, but it is too late! Then they can only obey with the fear that they will not be able to do so in time. To the extreme, they do not use thought or consideration, but only take the Japanese conclusion as their own conclusion, and no longer think about the theory and reason for reaching this conclusion." They often laugh at Wang Liang for obeying Kita and Harada, but they do not know that they themselves also listen to Kagesa. The following paragraph describes this matter: "If Kagesa is happy, they are happy; if Kagesa is worried, they are worried; if Kagesa pretends to be happy, they are truly happy; if Kagesa pretends to be worried, they are truly worried! They are touched by Kagesa's tears today. When they take office in the future, Kagesa's face will change, or he will be transferred back to his country and replaced by someone who treats them as special agents, who will inevitably be worse than Kita and Harada's treatment of Wang Liang." Over time, their cultivation has reached the superior realm of "doing whatever they want without breaking the rules." On the contrary, their attitude towards the Chinese is different. I once wrote: "Because they are afraid of seeing Chinese people, they pretend to hate seeing Chinese people, and in the end, they hate seeing Chinese people. Over time, they only believe in the Japanese side, only believe in the Chinese introduced by the Japanese side, thinking that they cannot be friends without this. Even doctors, guards, reporters, and prostitutes, only those of Japanese nationality are considered trustworthy, friendly, and lovable. On the contrary, their attitude towards patriotic compatriots who are unwilling or have not yet become slaves to the Japanese, especially those who are unwilling to join the ranks and 'go into the water,' is only one thought: 'Kill.' Therefore, dignified great figures are transformed into Ding Mocun. Apart from Mocun's brutal killing actions, I have not discovered what kind of policies and political guards Zhou and Mei have. They believe that people all over the world can be bought with money and ambushed with guns. They do not know that today's affairs are a national struggle. Although ordinary people are dragged down by life or personal matters and receive money, those whose conscience has not been extinguished all work lazily, and those whose conscience has been extinguished have no work to do. As for guns, Ziyou once said, 'People are not afraid of death, why scare them with death?' They do not know this. Ding Mocun and his subordinates did not intend to kill. They repeatedly suggested to Zhou Fohai, saying: 'Killing must be done moderately, otherwise the people's resentment is terrible.' I once wrote about this matter: 'They are all people with tears and blood. They only lack bone. Based on the lack of bone, they believe that the Japanese are trustworthy and friendly in everything, and no longer remember that the Japanese army is now firing cannons at our compatriots' soldiers and civilians on the battlefield. Therefore, they send their sons to Tokyo as hostages and leave their families in West Shanghai as hostages. They want to differentiate themselves from Wang Liang or want to extricate themselves from their peers, but they cannot extricate themselves. They only have to summon the courage to commit suicide, either do it or not do it. They only fear that their friends will not join them, only fear that their compatriots will not go into the water, and especially fear that their wives, children, and descendants will not willingly become slaves to Japan. Therefore, in the beginning, they are decadent, romantic, and lazy, and in the end, they summon the courage to move forward. In this process, how much blood and tears are offset by their work. I now know that Shi Jingtang and Zhang Bangchang all have unhappy and unrestrained states of mind, which may be due to being forced to do so, and to the point where they cannot stop even if they want to.' I painfully hope that the people of the country can rescue them with tears. I believe that they will one day thoroughly regret it, and I believe that they will one day change their minds and leave the service of the Japanese military.

(V)

In short, regarding the so-called "new regime," on the one hand, we must see the harsh and extensive conditions. Under these conditions, the "new regime" is just a machine that turns the established facts into conditions and then turns the conditions into laws, helping others to destroy ourselves. On the other hand, we must see clearly that even if the Japanese conditions are good, such a "government" that cannot exist on its own and cannot be independent can only "give" and cannot "take" under the coercion of the Japanese army and military police. Even if the Japanese conditions are good, they have no power to recover them. From the Japanese perspective, the "new regime" has no ability to end the incident. In international diplomacy and in the policy towards China, the "new regime" is an obstacle and at least has no benefit. The "Outline for Adjusting the New Sino-Japanese Relationship" and the "new regime" will eventually be abandoned by the Japanese. Even if the opportunity is now very late, I still shed my blood and tears, hoping that Mr. Wang and Mr. Zhou and Mr. Mei will rein in their horses on the edge of the cliff and abandon all activities under such conditions.

### Crisis is Everywhere Within Japan, Anti-War Elements are Active, Factories are Burned Down

Hong Kong, Tokyo Foreign News: Due to the prolongation of the war and the depletion of resources within Japan, the most prominent is the lack of coal. In order to save the crisis, the Japanese government ordered all factories in Kansai to suspend work from January 30, and the electric power company to stop generating electricity. At that time, the order was extremely chaotic, and anti-war elements in various places took the opportunity to act, simultaneously burning down all four factories, Qingjin Fishing Port, Akishi Fisheries, Nagai River, and Kitashio, with losses amounting to 20 million yuan. Forests in Kitakoma County, Yamanashi Prefecture, and Wakayama were also burned down by anti-war activists, with extremely heavy losses. Factories in various places have been catching fire and burning down every day, almost without a day without it. The Japanese government is extremely anxious and is currently struggling to find countermeasures. (12th telegram)

### The Seriousness of Stomach Disease

The stomach is located between the heart and abdomen and holds the general hub of the digestive function of the whole body. However, stomach diseases often arise due to our irregular diet, such as loss of appetite, vomiting, nausea, unbearable stomach pain, as well as internal ulcers, leading to dangerous symptoms. At this time, "Strong Stomach Essence" must be taken to be effective, because "Strong Stomach Essence" can promote increased appetite, supplement nutrition, and can quickly cure all stomach diseases, pale complexion, constipation, etc. "Strong Stomach Essence" is sold in the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company.

### Robust Husbands Inevitably Have Strong Reproductive Desires; Innocent and Beautiful Women Inevitably Possess Great Passion

— Authored by Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of a Russian Labor University Medical School

The common belief is this: if a man is physically strong, his sexual desire must be extraordinarily vigorous; if a woman is beautiful and charming, she must certainly be a passionate maiden. From a medical perspective, if these qualities are matched, nothing could be better. However, in reality, there are very few couples in society who are fortunate enough to form such ideal partnerships. This leads to a prevalence of mismatched couples and a scarcity of harmonious ones, which is truly perplexing!

Most doctors, based on their research, understand that the husbands of beautiful wives often cannot satisfy their wives' desire for love, entirely due to the husbands' diminished vitality. Consequently, various pathological conditions arise in their reproductive functions. It must be understood that the foundation of marital love is built entirely on physical desire. If a husband's sexual potency does not match his wife's beauty, it will stir up trouble in the river of love, making harmonious cohabitation impossible.

Therefore, in society, many divorces are caused by marital discord stemming from such hidden ailments. Thus, if a husband's sexual function is impaired by disease, the resulting loss in love is incalculable. A man with abundant semen can inspire his wife's interest, leading to mutual love and the feeling of wishing they had met sooner. Hence, to achieve lasting and harmonious love, one must pay careful attention to physical strength and the health of reproductive functions. Even if one possesses gold, it cannot buy a wife's happiness and will ultimately lead to the breaking apart of the Mandarin ducks (a symbol of marital bliss).

Premature ejaculation, impotence, localized smallness, nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, and neurasthenia are all signs of weakened reproductive power. To eliminate these problems, we must utilize the advancements of science and medicine. Internally consume "Bu Ti Kang" (Body Strength Kang), a genuine German preparation of male reproductive glandular extracts from robust animals. This formula was invented by the renowned German physiologist Dr. Meulen. In addition to extracting testicular essence from animals, its composition includes brain-nourishing phosphorus, blood-nourishing iron, and bone-strengthening calcium. Therefore, its effectiveness surpasses ordinary tonics. Whether due to premarital damage or post-marital indulgence, taking this remedy will immediately produce rejuvenating effects and can also promote metabolic function and increase body weight. The female version of "Bu Ti Kang" functions to regulate menstruation, promote conception, foster breast development, increase blood count, and eliminate anemia and chlorosis. It is an outstanding medicine in the field of gynecology.

### Solving the Problem of Difficult-to-Cure Gonorrhea

— By Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

The reason why gonorrhea is considered difficult to treat is not because of its violent nature, like cholera which causes death in the morning if contracted the night before, but rather because of its slow progression and difficulty in eradication. If strong drugs are used, not only will the body suffer damage, but the affected areas where the gonococci reside will remain untouched. Therefore, it is necessary to guide the situation according to its course. However, if mild drugs are used, it will be as futile as using a cup of water to put out a cartload of burning firewood, and may even exacerbate the virulence of the gonococci. As a result, medical professionals around the world feel challenged by persistent and difficult-to-cure gonorrhea. Therefore, the demonic scourge of gonorrhea is becoming increasingly severe. In the future, it is unknown to what extent the poison of gonorrhea will spread, causing human happiness to be devoured by this vicious demon.

Dr. Peter, a German doctor, devoted his entire life to conquering the gonorrhea that most doctors considered difficult to cure. He invented a preparation made from a mixture of protein and yellow pigment, manufactured using the latest scientific methods, and named it "Keling Nong" (Gonorrhea Conqueror). After taking it, a type of anti-gonococcal phagocyte is produced inside the patient, which not only has the effect of searching for gonococci but also clears the residual toxins in the blood of gonorrhea patients without damaging healthy tissues. It truly has the miraculous effect of curing the disease with medication. When I returned from studying in Europe and America, I visited major venereal disease hospitals in various countries. For the treatment of acute and chronic gonorrhea, they all used "Keling Nong" as the primary oral medication. After returning to my country and establishing my own practice, I have always used "Keling Nong" to treat gonorrhea. I have also extracted blood from patients who have taken "Keling Nong" and examined it under a microscope. After taking this medication for three weeks, regardless of how difficult-to-cure the gonorrhea is, there is absolutely no presence of gonococci in the blood. In other words, "Keling Nong" can cure difficult-to-conquer gonorrhea in a short period of time. However, for all stages of gonorrhea, you can also use "Anti-Gonorrhea Fluid" externally at the same time. Follow the diagrams and instructions to secretly treat yourself at home, in order to remove the gonococci between the rough edges of the urethra. For women with gonorrheal leukorrhea, you can use "Ka Er Xue Di Vaginal Suppositories" as a suppository in addition to taking "Keling Nong" orally, which will have an even more significant effect.

### Essential Points for Treating the Lungs

— By Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

The lung is an insensible organ, so when it is invaded by tubercle bacilli, it feels nothing. Even if it is eroded to form cavities, there is no particular pain. Only when tubercle bacilli attack the pleura and cause pleurisy, there is a feeling of stabbing pain in the chest, or even pleural effusion due to pleurisy, or death due to tuberculous meningitis. Therefore, the treatment of lung disease should pay attention to nourishment, such as air circulation, sufficient sunlight, and especially the intake of nutritious and easily digestible foods. Also, avoid smoking, alcohol and other stimulants. In terms of life’s vital aspects, special attention should be paid to the lung disease specific drug "Bu Fei Na Er" (Lung Tonic Na Er), to increase lung petrification, kill tubercle bacilli, in this way lung disease, no matter what stage it reaches, can be completely cured from the root. Therefore, it is no accident that "Bu Fei Na Er" can be popular in various countries

### The Course of Treatment for Curing Leukorrhea and Spermatorrhea

— By Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

Patient Zhang Yusheng, 22 years old, from Zhenjiang, has been engaged in business in Shanghai. (Self-statement) — At the age of sixteen, due to the temptation of classmates, he began to masturbate. Three years later, his body became increasingly weak, suffering from spermatorrhea, insomnia, dizziness, blurred vision, weak memory, and occasional tinnitus. (The beginning and end of the disease) — Zhang Jun was damaged by masturbation, resulting in excessive damage to his reproductive function. His body became extremely weak, leading to spermatorrhea, nocturnal emission, and neurasthenia. As a result, the body's metabolism became sluggish. He panicked and sought medical treatment, but due to temporary ignorance, he mistakenly took commercially available sperm-strengthening drugs. The symptoms persisted, and soon the illness worsened. Last winter, he could no longer delay and had to ask for leave from the store where he worked to rest and recuperate in Shanghai. He came to my clinic for treatment on November 1st of last year. (The course of treatment) — In addition to surgically massaging his prostate, I also gave him electrotherapy for fifteen minutes every day, instructed him to abstain from masturbation, and avoid smoking, alcohol, spicy and sour foods. I also strictly instructed him to exercise diligently and prescribed three German spermatorrhea-specific "Nairis Spermatorrhea Tablets" every night. — After three days, he immediately felt comfortable sleeping and had fewer erotic dreams. After taking it for a month, spermatorrhea never occurred, proving that the medicine had a therapeutic effect. However, to cure it completely, I prescribed "Bu Ti Kang" (Body Strength Kang), a large German tonic containing testicular essence, to nourish the body and mind, replenish the body's deficiency, and promote metabolic function. After taking it for two months, he felt his body weight increase, his brainpower invigorated, his complexion rosy, and his appetite greatly improved. Knowing that the illness had been completely cured, he stopped taking the medication.

New Words on Gonorrhea

### Special Therapy After Leukorrhea is Cured

Written by Dr. Yao Juyan Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, corner of Sichuan Road

Untreated leukorrhea can be called chronic white fate. (III) There is no irritation when applying this electrotherapy. Therefore, it is called white turbidness. Usually, after a person suffers from gonorrhea, unless it is completely cured during the acute period, it can be called untreated leukorrhea. After leukorrhea is not treated, its complications become very complicated. Therefore, it is also very difficult to treat. However, with the progress of science today, various methods of science can be used to examine all kinds of untreated leukorrhea and treat it according to the symptoms. As a result, patients may be completely cured in a short period of time.

In terms of gonorrhea treatment methods, great progress has been made in recent years. Taking electrotherapy as an example, it is very different from what it was a few years ago. The most effective electrical therapy now is German inductive static electrotherapy. This electrotherapy has three advantages; (1) The effect can play a bactericidal role on the deep lesions of the organization. (2) There is no pain during the procedure. The operation is completed under quiet and comfortable conditions, and internal use of gonorrhea magic medicine "Keling Nong" makes all parts of the body produce anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect, so that the deep gonococci that are difficult to reach are surrounded and eliminated by this drug. Therefore, all acute and chronic gonorrhea, no matter how deep-rooted they are, can be completely cured if these therapies are applied. Over the past 20 years, I have tried almost all kinds of therapies, and under close statistics, I feel that the results are most satisfactory based on the above methods. Especially for untreated leukorrhea, the application of these therapies is more effective. Clinic: 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. Twenty consultations are given every day, and each number costs only five corners, and a complete book on venereal diseases is given as a gift. Also treats syphilis, groin swellings, chancres, sexual neurasthenia, etc.

### The Battle on the Qin-Yong Line is About to Unfold; Chinese Troops Repeatedly Inflict Heavy Casualties on the Japanese Army; Japanese Army Deaths and Injuries Have Exceeded 10,000

Hong Kong Correspondence: The battle on the Qin-Yong Highway is gradually unfolding. Chinese troops are actively cutting off the Japanese army's lines of communication and supply. A major battle will soon commence. The following is a record of the battle situation on all sides:

Chinese Troops Control the Yong-Qin Highway

After the major victory, the Chinese troops on the south bank of the Yong River also intensified their attacks on the Japanese army at various points. The Japanese side sent reinforcements one after another. At 4:00 PM on January 13th, more than 1,000 new troops arrived, carrying twelve heavy machine guns. They departed from Sheji and headed towards Qinxi, turning towards Dongdong. The Chinese troops launched frequent attacks on the Japanese army on the Yong-Qin Highway, and have successively recovered many key points. The Chinese troops near Qinxian are even more active. The highway in this area is still under the control of the Chinese army. The section of the highway between Qin and Xiaodong has also been cut off. The Japanese army near Xiaodong launched a two-pronged attack on Bicheng, which was held by the Chinese side, on the morning of the 14th. They encountered resistance at Huajia Mountain and Tunmao respectively, and fierce fighting broke out. By the afternoon, they had suffered more than half their casualties, leaving behind hundreds of corpses and fleeing. They were ambushed along the way by Chinese troops, suffering even greater losses. Another Japanese force advancing from Dachizhen and Natianxu in Qinxian was also met with a head-on attack by the Chinese army, and fled in a state of panic. On the 15th, a unit of the Japanese army from Qinxian attacked Datangxu, but were killed in large numbers by the Chinese army. As for the Japanese army attacking Zhennanxu, they were forced close for annihilation by the Chinese army, suffering more than half their casualties. Attempting to break through, they released a large amount of poison gas. The Chinese troops braved death to charge and kill many Japanese soldiers, capturing a Japanese captain commanding a company. The Chinese army also used a certain unit to intercept the Japanese transport troops. One night, they sent troops to ambush in the forest near Na. By the next morning, they encountered more than forty Japanese trucks, fully loaded with food, gasoline, guns, ammunition, etc., heading from the Yong-Qin Road towards Xiaodong north of Qinxian. They waited in ambush until the trucks approached, then attacked with heavy machine guns and grenades, blowing up more than twenty Japanese trucks into powder, and killing more than a hundred Japanese soldiers, including the Japanese captain Bo Wei.

According to Fangjun News, after the Japanese troops at Niu Jiulong and Zhennanxu were defeated, they have now all concentrated between Xiaodong and Dagang, resting and replenishing in an attempt to regroup. The Chinese side has ordered the recovery of Zhennanxu and Niugang and is continuing to advance, aiming for the Qin-Yong Highway, determined to cut off the Japanese army's transportation and supply and control their fate. The vanguard has arrived near Shuiyongtang, and will meet up to put pressure on Xiaodong. The Chinese guerrillas along the Qin-Yong Road are responding internally, and there is already a fierce confrontation. A bloody battle is about to unfold.

Japanese Wounded Soldiers Congregate in Qin and Yong

Since the Japanese army landed in Qinfang and invaded the territory of Gui, there have been dozens of battles of all sizes, and the number of casualties has gradually increased. According to the intelligence of the 16th Army Group, the number of Japanese deaths and injuries has exceeded 10,000. Just in the first half of January, more than 2,000 people were injured in the territory of Gui. The severity of Japanese casualties is conceivable. It is found that this group of wounded soldiers have all been sent back to Qinxian. Therefore, most of the relatively complete houses and shops in Qincheng have been forcibly occupied and converted into temporary hospitals. Unexpectedly, on January 26th, a riot broke out among a group of wounded soldiers, resulting in a fierce battle with the guarding Japanese soldiers. The order of the entire city was disrupted. It was not until 3:00 PM that a large number of Japanese troops entered the city to suppress the riot, and the situation was brought under control. After the incident, it was found that the reason for the riot was that the wounded soldiers resented being forced by the warlords and tricked into coming to die. A total of 500 wounded soldiers participated in the riot, and 105 were killed on the spot, while the rest were all imprisoned.

Recently, many Japanese transport vehicles have arrived in Nanning from the front lines, fully loaded with wounded soldiers. On the 16th, more than 20 vehicles of wounded soldiers were transported back to Yong. On that day, the shops under the arcades of Minsheng Road and Xingning Road, the longest roads in Yong City, were filled with wounded soldiers, leaving no place to settle them. The Japanese army again rounded up children in the four townships of Nanning, with about 200 people being rounded up and transported back to Yong City. By the previous month, 50 to 60 vehicles had been transported back to Japan, all for the purpose of drawing blood to treat wounded soldiers.

Kami'i and Riku'u are Terribly Ravaged

According to a military intelligence report, the Japanese army's intrusion into the Kami'i and Riku'u areas was met with fierce attacks by the Chinese army. They suffered too many deaths and injuries and were unable to resist, and retreated to Qin Dong in defeat. As a result, the homes in all the places passed by the Japanese army were reduced to ruins, and ×××× could be seen everywhere. The various districts of Shinriku'u and Kami'i were all reduced to ashes. Hundreds of women were abducted near Riku'u, the younger ones were ××, and the older ones were shot. The sound of crying could be heard everywhere, which was unbearable to hear. Three corpses of our soldiers were found near the Kami'i position. Their heads and faces had been cut off, and their abdomens had been cut open and their intestines dug out. More plainclothes teams were sent to scout out military information, and a small number of ignorant people were induced by traitors and brutally killed. Now, the local people are automatically assisting the Chinese army in attacking the Japanese army, and the momentum is very strong.

### Constant Fierce Battles in Various Counties of Northern Jiangsu; Heavy Casualties on Both Sides in the Battle of Taixing; Coastal Bandits Land at Various Ports in Qidong

Northern Jiangsu Correspondence: Chinese troops in various counties of Northern Jiangsu have been constantly engaged in fierce battles with puppet troops in recent days. The battle situation is described as follows:

Taixing

The city of Taixing was attacked by a large number of Japanese troops on January 16th, and Japanese warships on the Yangtze River concentrated on the north bank to provide cover with fierce artillery fire, dividing their troops to launch a fierce attack. The effective range of the Japanese artillery fire happened to extend to the suburbs of Taixing, so the Chinese army could not defend it, and transferred its troops and institutions outside the city, so the city was unfortunately occupied by the Japanese army. All the units of the Chinese side have recently completed their equipment, and the military authorities have ordered the recovery of the city as soon as possible. Certain senior officials personally directed the attack, launching four-pronged counterattacks on the city of Taixing at the same time at about 10:00 PM on the 27th in the piercing cold wind. The × column first surrounded and annihilated the Japanese army at the Daixing Bridge outside the west gate of Taixing, and fierce fighting broke out. The Chinese army also divided its troops and rushed in through the west gate. At the same time, a certain division of the Chinese army successively attacked in from the northeast gates at 11:00 PM, so fierce street battles broke out in the northeast and west three gates. Short arms were connected, and white blades were fought. The Chinese army also set fire to the houses in the city where the Japanese army was entrenched. However, at that time, a certain unit that was responsible for attacking the south gate was a little late in its movement, so the Japanese reinforcements rushed out of that gate to support the Japanese army that was surrounded at Daixing Bridge outside the west gate. However, the Chinese troops who had stormed into the northeast and west three gates fought bloody battles with the Japanese army all night. The Japanese army then retreated to the bunkers they had built in advance, resisting stubbornly. As of 4:00 AM on the 28th, the Chinese army withdrew from the city to outside the city in order to avoid massive sacrifices. The northeast two gates are still under the control and surveillance of the Chinese army, while the west gate is surrounded by the Chinese army. The Japanese army at Daixing Bridge has been defeated. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered extremely heavy casualties in the city, and the Chinese side also made heroic sacrifices.

Taixian

There has been little change in the battle situation on the southeast and west sides of Taixian in recent days. Both sides are still holding on to their original positions, and there is no major contact. There are not many Japanese troops in the port, and they are stubbornly defending with strong fortifications. After the disastrous defeat of the Japanese army in Yangshao, there has been no activity in recent days.

Qidong

Coastal bandits Shen Siyuan, Zhang Rong, Lu Axiang, Zhang Anyang, etc. led their troops to attack various ports in the southeast of the county. County Magistrate Dong followed the order to block the ports of Dongyihao, Xiyihao and the county reserve team, and transferred troops to aid them. More than 600 bandits and puppets landed and attacked Dongyihao on the flank on the 19th. The reserve team supported until noon, and the platoon leaders Meng Tongyuan, Xu Mingjie, and Shen Zhaochang and the company commander Tian Jingming were killed in action due to running out of ammunition and reinforcements. The team had no choice but to retreat to await reinforcements. County Magistrate Dong immediately telegraphed × Brigade for assistance, and mobilized two squadrons of the county reserve team to guard the county government. By 3:00 PM, the bandit troops who landed at various ports had surrounded the county on all sides. County Magistrate Dong, seeing that the bandit puppet army was coming on strong, ordered his subordinates to temporarily transfer the important documents and seals to the north under the cover of the police squadron. The county was then captured by the bandits. It is said that the bandit puppet army that attacked the county this time consisted of about 2,500 people, equipped with complete rifles and more than 100 light and heavy machine guns. They were mobilized by the Japanese army and continued to land at various ports along the coast and the river, forming a siege around the county. County Magistrate Tong led his troops to resist at noon on the 19th, but due to the thinness of his forces, and the forces of × Brigade being scattered at various important ports in Haimen to guard against the Japanese army, reinforcements could not arrive for a while, so it was not until 4:30 PM that they arrived at the county seat. They encountered a fierce battle with the bandit puppet army for several hours, and finally held the line of Yugong River because of excessive casualties. At dawn on the 20th, × Commander personally led his troops to counterattack the county in three routes, rushing into street battles three times. The bandit troops continued to increase, and their weapons and ammunition were excellent, and the firepower was fierce. The Chinese army suffered heavy casualties and moved to the original position. It is estimated that × Brigade suffered about 300 casualties on the 19th and 20th. However, on the 24th, the Chinese army had encircled the Yin bandit puppet army in Huilongzhen, and after the brave attack of various units, more than 100 rifles and 50,000 rounds of ammunition have been seized.

Suining. On the 20th, more than 200 Japanese puppets in Suining County attacked the Eighth District. Liu Tianzhan, the magistrate of Suining County, mobilized the people in the western district to attack the county to show the restraint of the Japanese troops in the city. At about 10 pm, they attacked the west gate of the county, approaching the city wall. The Japanese army shot at the Chinese side with intensive artillery fire. The Chinese army still rushed towards the city gate. They rushed to the west gate and killed the Japanese soldiers guarding the city. However, because the Japanese firepower on the city wall was too fierce, and the city gate was closed tightly, they were unable to rush in and retreated to the original position. In this battle, the Japanese side suffered a dozen casualties, and the Chinese army also suffered casualties. Later, County Mayor Liu ordered Wang ××'s troops to attack the Japanese strongholds in Baohang and Gaozuo, where fierce battles broke out with the Japanese army, killing a dozen Japanese puppet soldiers before returning to their original defense.

Jieshou On the morning of the 20th, three Japanese boats carrying 70 to 80 Japanese soldiers sailed near Yunti on Jieshou Lake, using fierce artillery fire to cover and forcibly land, attacking the Chinese army position in Cha'an. After a fierce counterattack by the Chinese army, the Japanese army collapsed after three hours of fierce fighting and returned to their boats. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered seven or eight casualties, and the Chinese side killed one soldier, and seized two rifles and a new box gun. On the morning of the 21st, three Japanese boats again carrying more than 100 Japanese soldiers sailed near Zipo Gate on the lake, covered by machine guns, still trying to land and attack. After a strong resistance by the Chinese soldiers guarding the gate, the Japanese boats returned to the lake and anchored. On the morning of the 25th, the Japanese army from Liujiabao continued to attack, using 50 to 60 artillery shells, so that the artillery fire could be heard clearly in Jieshou. The Chinese army also returned fire to the Japanese side, so the Japanese army still did not succeed.

Yancheng

About 200 Japanese troops in Hexingzhen, at about 6 am on January 24, divided into four routes to attack Zhongxingqiao in Fenghuangtou. The Chinese army sent people to Huangshazha to meet the attack. At 11 o'clock, a fierce battle broke out. The Japanese army's artillery fire was very fierce. The Chinese army withdrew from Zhongxing Bridge and moved to Diaojian. At 2 pm, the Chinese army reinforced the counterattack against the Japanese army on three sides. The Japanese army collapsed and fled back to Hexingzhen, and Zhongxing Bridge was recovered by the Chinese army.

### Over Two Years of Chinese Resistance; National Strength Progresses Twenty Years; Strive for Reconstruction and Resource Development; Military Has Been Able to Resolutely Resist Indefinitely; Impressions of Ms. He Mo's Tour of the War Zone

According to the Continental Daily, the United Press International reported from New York on the 11th that Ms. He Mo, a representative of the American Church in China Relief Committee, toured the Chinese war zone for more than a year. She recently returned here via Japan. Ms. He plans to speak in various parts of the United States under the auspices of the committee, presenting the famine situation in North China to the American people, and explaining that if the poor men, women, and children in North China are not relieved, at least ten million people will lose their lives this winter due to hunger and cold.

Japanese People Fiercely Oppose War

According to Ms. He, she stopped in Japan on her way back to the United States and gave several speeches on the situation in China to private gatherings. The audience was Japanese anti-war activists who were deeply interested in her speeches. The Japanese people long for peace, but they are of course blinded and do not know the true reality of the outside world. The Japanese Parliament has no power to interfere in most matters. Japanese leaders who do not sympathize with the military told her that "they feel that Japan's continued war against China can no longer be economically sustained for more than two years."

Chinese People Strive to Develop Resources

On the other hand, the Chinese people are determined to continue the war by increasing resources, which is due to the establishment of an important system of industrial cooperation in the unoccupied areas of China. Industrial cooperation is established with funds provided by the government and overseas, etc. With machinery and tools, it is possible to use raw materials, so that the Chinese government gradually no longer relies on imported goods.

Reconstruction Power Is Amazing

Today's China is a united nation. In the emergency of the war in the past two years, China has progressed at least twenty years. China's recovery power is quite amazing. Even during air raids, they began to rebuild cities and invested heavily in reconstruction. Therefore, it is difficult for foreigners to understand how rapidly China is modernizing. The opening of schools and universities, the rebuilding of railways and highways, and the construction of houses are all actively carried out.

North China Urgently Needs Relief

However, China urgently needs relief. When she toured many parts of North China in early autumn, she saw that the people had already eaten the bark and leaves of trees. The suffering of the people in the occupied areas cannot be described in words. Unprecedented floods occurred in the northeastern provinces, and countless people lost their lives. American and other foreign missionaries carried food by boat to provide relief, but the relief supplies were extremely insufficient.

China's Resistance Force Is Growing Stronger

Ms. He also said that the Chinese people have clearly united to support Chairman Chiang. From a military point of view, China is becoming stronger and can resolutely resist indefinitely. She traveled through fifteen provinces by train, plane, donkey, camel, and ambulance, or on foot. She encountered guerrilla warfare along the way. She witnessed the progress of guerrilla warfare from the terrace of a hospital, which lasted for several nights.

Air Raids Encountered Repeatedly Along the Way

She also encountered air raids repeatedly and helped distribute food transported by ship in the Tianjin area. She found that after the air raids on Wanxian and Yichang, the wounded people were not properly treated, so there was a great need for medicine in both places. Ms. He is 24 years old and will visit her parents in St. Augustine, Florida, and then begin speaking in various places.

The various banks that are members of the Banking Industry Association, as well as the Bank Joint Reserve, the Clearing House, the Bill Acceptance House, the Qianlian Joint Reserve, the Money Industry Market, the Money Exchange Industry Market, and the black market for securities, gold, and foreign exchange, all resumed operations yesterday. However, the markets for beans, rice, and miscellaneous grains are scheduled to resume trading today. The Money Industry Market suspended the afternoon market yesterday. The ocean demolition market price is still one cent, which proves that the Shanghai financial market is still stable. The discount committee of the Zhongzhongjiaonong Four Banks continues to handle various discounts for the same industry, which are still transferred by the silver and money industry reserve banks.

### Shanghai Coal Prices Soar; Coal Industry Will Convene to Discuss Stabilization; Bathhouse and Cooked Water Industries Face Difficulties; Municipal Federation Suggests That All Parties Hope for Speedy Implementation

Shanghai coal prices have soared, and many cooked water businesses have been forced to close. The bathhouse industry is also difficult to maintain. Other factory production and people's daily use have been deeply and seriously affected, which is a concern for all parties. According to people familiar with the coal industry, the reason for the high coal prices in Shanghai is nothing more than the restriction of North China coal coming to Shanghai, the sudden rise in freight rates for coal from Annam and India, and the speculation and manipulation by hoarders, which is even more guilty. Wherever there is profit, even people who are not in the coal industry are alarmed. If a thorough investigation can be carried out, it can be known that the coal stored in warehouses is extremely abundant, and these coal owners are waiting for a good price to sell. According to news from the Coal Industry Association, the association is equally concerned about the current coal prices and plans to convene a meeting to discuss stabilization measures. All parties hope that the relevant authorities will implement the First Special District Municipal Federation's suggestions to limit coal prices, investigate coal reserves, and dredge sources.

### Weather Warms Up; Heavy Fog on the Huangpu River; Dozens of Foreign Ships Temporarily Suspend Imports and Exports

The weather has warmed up in recent days, but heavy fog is pervasive, the sea is very dangerous, and navigation is difficult. The Huangpu River is also covered by heavy fog in the morning and evening, making it impossible to distinguish between Pudong and Puxi on both sides of the river. The ships anchored in the Huangpu River only show flashing lights at night, and the ship bodies are completely invisible. Therefore, the ships sailing on the sea are extremely dangerous. In order to avoid accidents, the foghorns are sounded from time to time, and the ships anchor and stop when necessary. Therefore, the schedules of the import and export liners are affected.

It is reported that there were as many as twenty ships that were supposed to export yesterday, but they are still anchored in the Wusongkou, waiting for the fog to clear before exporting. As of 2:00 PM yesterday, only two Japanese ships and one foreign ship had imported. Therefore, a total of only four ships imported within 6:00 PM yesterday. It is reported that the Depei ship of the Sino-Italian Company returned to Shanghai from Ningbo, and the Zhangjiakou ship of the Taikoo Company came to Shanghai from South China, and have both arrived outside the Wusongkou. Because the heavy fog makes it inconvenient to import, it is estimated that they will be able to arrive after the fog clears this morning.

The French mail ship Dardania, which was originally scheduled to arrive yesterday, had not been imported as of the evening, and is expected to be affected by the heavy fog. It should be able to dock today or tomorrow. The Keithden and Libei ships, which operate on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, Beisha, are scheduled to resume service last night after a break for the Lunar New Year, but due to the fog, they may not be able to export on time, and may be slightly delayed. The Haifu ship of the Shanghai-Ningbo Qianlihe Foreign Company, which was originally scheduled to go from Shanghai to Zhen yesterday, has also not been seen to depart.

### Cooked Water Industry's Repeated Petition: Coal Price Soars, Affecting Operations; Industry Illegally Raises Prices

Over 500 cooked water shops in this city have been significantly affected by the soaring price of coal. Consequently, their income cannot offset expenses, and over 300 shops have already temporarily suspended business. Cooked water is crucial to the livelihood of ordinary people. If cooked water shops declare closure, the general public will inevitably have to burn water individually. Moreover, the price of coal balls has risen to around $5.80 per load, thus invisibly increasing the cost of living for ordinary people. The authorities are paying close attention to the widespread closures of cooked water shops and have decided to crack down on illegal coal hoarding to suppress coal prices, as well as urge coal businesses to supply cheap coal to the cooked water industry as much as possible. Now, the cooked water industry association, recognizing that the closure of cooked water shops not only concerns overall public order and the livelihood of ordinary people but also threatens cooked water operators with starvation and loss of livelihood, has again dispatched representatives, including Zhang Delong, Qiu Tingsen, Xu Yanwu, Zhang Liansheng, Shi Xingli, and Su Zixiang, to visit prominent figures in the business community, such as Yuan Ludeng and Kui Yanfang, requesting continued assistance. They also presented over a hundred letters from members who have ceased operations to demonstrate the reality of their situation. However, a small number of members have been so unscrupulous as to publicly announce and automatically raise prices to one cent per ladle. The industry association, in addition to sending personnel to earnestly advise them, has also recorded their shop names and addresses for investigation.

### Excessive Profit Tax Still Collected by Three Banks; Chamber of Commerce Sends Circular to All Industries

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a circular to all industry associations in the city, stating: "Regarding the government's implementation of the excessive profit tax, many industries have inquired about details. After we sent a letter to the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance for detailed investigation, we received a reply on the 25th of this month. The reply stated: 'We have received and read your letters of the 11th and 14th of this month. Upon investigation, the excessive profit tax is still collected by the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications (see Article 11 of the Implementing Regulations). The report form has not yet been issued. We are now enclosing 300 copies of the Regulations and Implementing Regulations on Excessive Profit Tax During Extraordinary Times for your examination and distribution.' We are enclosing one copy each of the regulations and implementing regulations for your inspection and will print multiple copies for distribution to your respective industries."

### Dinghai Battle Report: Japanese Land at Xiaosha and Liuheng; Fierce Fighting, Japanese Soldiers Retreat

According to reliable sources in the shipping industry, on the 7th of this month, a unit of Japanese troops intruded into Fanhe Township in Dinghai County, resulting in fierce fighting. The Japanese were unable to withstand the resistance and retreated. On the 8th, the Japanese sent naval forces to land at Xiaosha in Northwest Township and launched a fierce attack on Chinese troops at Ma Huangling. The battle continued until about 6 p.m., resulting in 50 to 60 Japanese casualties. The Chinese side suffered injuries to company commander Zeng Peng and several members of the National Resistance Guard. The Japanese were unable to withstand the resistance and retreated. Furthermore, it is reported that Japanese troops in Liuheng, also under the jurisdiction of the county, landed in small motorboats. They were met with fierce resistance from Chinese troops, and the situation remains unclear.

### US Ship "Chaumont" Completes Term, Returns Home; Two New Ships to Take Over

The U.S. transport ship "Chaumont" was ordered by the Navy Department on October 3, 1921, to serve in the Far East, sailing annually through Honolulu, Guam, Manila, Hong Kong, and Shanghai to Qingdao and Qinhuangdao in North China to handle transport matters. The ship first came to China as early as 1927, when the National Revolutionary Army initially conquered Shanghai, carrying U.S. Marines to reinforce the concessions. Subsequently, it arrived in Shanghai during the 1928 incident and the August 13th Shanghai battle. Now that its term in China has expired, the Navy Department has ordered it to return to San Diego. The U.S. Navy Department's transport duties in the Far East will be taken over by two other ships, expected to arrive in Shanghai in the early autumn of next year.

### Suspension of Small Parcels to Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou; Resumption of Parcel Service to Guangzhou

### Assassination Occurs on Wangzhi Road Yesterday Morning; Huang Zhide Dies of Three Gunshot Wounds; Deceased Previously Worked at Municipal Police Bureau

Around 7:00 a.m. yesterday morning, a shooting occurred on Wangzhi Road in the French Concession. The victim was shot three times and died shortly after. Details are recorded below:

Previously Worked at Municipal Police Bureau

The residence at No. 216 Wangzhi Road, along the road in the French Concession, is a Shikumen residence in the Junzhuang area (the Beiyongji Lane property). The three rooms in the attic on the second floor are rented by a Hunan Changsha native named Huang Zhide. Huang is 48 years old and formerly served as a staff member in the Tobacco Inspection Section of the Fourth Division of the Municipal Police Bureau.

Selling Various Goods After the War

When Huang worked at the Municipal Police Bureau, he resided in Nanshi with his wife, Qin, and an eight-year-old daughter. After the "August 13th" battle, Huang moved his family to Wangzhi Road, paying a monthly rent of nine yuan. Together with two or three acquaintances, he pooled funds to sell various goods, traveling along the East Shanghai line, and managed to make a living. The night before last was the fourth day of the first lunar month, and Huang went to bed late. Therefore, he had not yet gotten up at 7:00 a.m. yesterday.

Two Thugs Arrive Suddenly in the Early Morning

At 7:10 a.m. yesterday, while Huang was still in bed, his wife, Qin, was at the market buying vegetables. Suddenly, two thugs wearing riding breeches and woolen overcoats, each carrying a handgun, barged into the attic on the second floor. They kicked open the door and, seeing Huang still in bed, fired several shots at him. Huang was unable to resist and was hit twice in the chest and once in the left leg.

Huang Barely Breathing After Being Shot

Huang fell backward onto the bed, bleeding profusely. The two thugs, seeing their goal achieved, turned and left, disappearing without a trace. When the gunshots rang out, neighbors initially suspected they were firecrackers for the Lunar New Year. However, upon hearing cries for help from the room, they rushed over together and immediately reported to the police station. A police detective arrived to investigate and found Huang unable to speak and barely breathing.

Treatment Ineffective, Dies

An ambulance was called, and he was rushed to the Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died at 11:10 a.m. The hospital notified the police station, which transported the body to the morgue on Talarik Road for examination. Meanwhile, the bullet casings were collected and sent to the Firearms Inspection Department for examination. The examination revealed that the bullets used by the thugs were the same as those used in the assassination of Mao Liying, a member of the Professional Women's Association, and Huang Xiong, a staff member of Jinan University last winter.

Xiangsheng Car Robbery

At around 6:00 a.m. yesterday morning, the Xiangsheng Taxi branch on Jing'an Temple Road in West Shanghai suddenly received a phone call requesting a taxi to the intersection of Jisi Fei'er Road and Kaina Road. The station's accountant immediately ordered a taxi driver to drive a taxi with concession license plate number 18425 to the address. When the car arrived at the Kaina Road intersection, five men and a woman were already standing by the roadside. They waved to stop the car, boarded in single file, and ordered the driver to go somewhere. However, after traveling only a short distance, one of them pulled out a handgun and forced the driver out of the car. The taxi driver, witnessing the car being robbed, quickly fled and reported to the Jing'an Temple Road police station for investigation. An hour later, the car was found in front of a village in Yidingpan Road. The police are currently investigating whether the car is related to the assassination on Wangzhi Road in the French Concession.

### Soaring Prices Continue Unabated; Charity Groups Busy with Relief; Charity Federation Continues to Distribute Steamed Buns and Ginger Soup; Number of Recipients Increases More Than Tenfold

Shanghai experienced two snowfalls at the end of the lunar year, and the weather was extremely cold. Homeless people froze to death on the streets, a tragic sight. Although various charity groups organized temporary relief efforts, such as distributing rice and steamed buns, it was like a drop in the bucket. However, after the Spring Festival, the weather suddenly turned warmer, and the threat of cold waves to the homeless was reduced. The First Special District Municipal Federation sent a letter to the Refugee Association last winter requesting emergency relief for homeless people on the streets. The federation received a reply from the association yesterday, stating: "We have approved the suggestion in your letter to allocate funds to relieve poor people in the alleys and distribute cotton clothing. This demonstrates your compassion for the poor and needy. We admire your intentions. However, the scope of our association is limited to relieving refugees and cannot be carried out due to regulations. We are replying accordingly."

Extending Relief Period

Since the Charity Federation began distributing steamed buns and ginger soup at New Dagu Road and Dahua Road on the 9th of last month (the beginning of the twelfth lunar month), the crowds of poor people waiting for relief every evening have been overwhelming. As of the 7th of this month (the 30th of the twelfth lunar month), a total of 1,145 bags of steamed buns and flour and 112 wooden barrels of hot ginger soup have been distributed in one month. The poor people have benefited greatly from this charitable act. The federation originally planned to end this relief effort on the 7th of this month, for a period of one month. However, in view of the current soaring prices in this city, which continue unabated, and the difficulty for residents to make a living, it has been decided to extend the relief period.

Purchasing Flour at Low Prices

Starting at 5:30 p.m. this afternoon (the 13th), the distribution of steamed buns and ginger soup will continue at the empty space at the intersection of Dahua Road and Ai Yi Road. In terms of order, in addition to the association's on-site supervision, the Jing'an Temple police station has also assigned several Chinese and foreign detectives to maintain order on-site. Due to the daily increase in the number of poor people waiting for relief, the number of steamed buns distributed has also increased more than tenfold. The association has not only negotiated with the Fuxin Flour Mill to purchase flour at low prices, but also local enthusiastic charitable individuals in this city have generously donated funds.

Anonymous Congee Distribution

A kind-hearted person in this city, Mr. Wu, recognizing the difficult lives of the displaced compatriots and poor people in the shantytowns of West Shanghai, who are struggling with hunger and cold, has funded the distribution of congee to benefit the poor. He has set up a shed with stoves on the empty space next to the Central Funeral Home on Gordon Road and Ma Bai Road. Since it began on December 17 last year, no fewer than 5,000 people have sought congee every day. On Ma Bai Road, the old, young, and women line up, stretching across both ends of the road. However, the order is excellent, and the facilities inside the shed are complete. Entrances and exits are separated by wooden stakes, and there is no chaos during distribution. The distribution time is from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., with each adult receiving three ladles of congee and each child two. Those who receive it are all delighted. It is also learned that the amount of congee distributed at the location averages 12 stoves per day. All expenses are donated by Mr. Wu personally, and the workers are all volunteers from a factory. When asked for Mr. Wu's real name, the workers replied with a smile, "Mr. Wu does not want to reveal his real name but hopes that kind-hearted people from all walks of life will rise up and respond."

Salvation Army Report

The Salvation Army Brigadier General announced that the Salvation Army has raised over 70,000 yuan and expects to reach 80,000 by the end of this week. Two weeks ago, a Chinese person went to the Salvation Army headquarters and donated 500 yuan in Chinese currency, requesting that his name not be disclosed. A week ago, he donated another 500 yuan, and last night he donated another 500 yuan. This person stated before leaving that the work of the Salvation Army is great. Many recent donors are Chinese. One Chinese person generously donated 10,000 yuan, the largest donation to date. The Salvation Army has established a rickshaw pullers committee in Shanghai to provide shelter for displaced men and to provide the poor with food, clothing, shelter, and medical care, greatly benefiting refugees. The Army's food trucks appear every evening in important city centers, and hungry people can get a free meal. The Army needs funds urgently. Donations from all walks of life can be sent to No. 40 Sassoon House, and all amounts are welcome.

Since the Japanese landing in Guinan, the first brigade of the Shanghai Boy Scout 50th Regiment wartime service immediately dispatched members to the front lines to perform tasks such as transporting the wounded. It is now learned that members He Mingjiu, Yao Qinfu, Zhao Baoxiang, Dai Mingqiu, Zhu Zhijun, Ma Jiaqi, Luo Wenguang, etc., have been promoted from transportation work to captains of wounded transportation teams with over a year of battlefield service experience.

### Barbed Wire Fence Erected at Lone Army Camp, Immediately Demolished; White Russian Regiment Erected it Without Authorization; Authorities Express Extreme Regret

The Lone Army stationed at the Jiaozhou Road Lone Army Camp has been detained for 18 months. Their daily lives are like a regular army, with strict discipline and no out-of-line behavior. Yesterday morning, a White Russian military officer led over ten White Russian workers to erect a barbed wire fence without reason. Officers and soldiers of the unit believed there was no need for it and immediately stopped the White Russians from building it. The White Russians refused to accept this, and they faced off against each other for about an hour. At this time, a crowd of over 2,000 people gathered at the entrance of the Lone Army Camp. The White Russian workers beat innocent civilians, seriously injuring three people in the head and injuring over ten others, who were sent to various hospitals for treatment. After investigation, it was confirmed that the seriously injured, whose heads were cracked and one eye was blinded, were Shi Huisheng and Chen Jinfu, who were sent to the hospital by the police. Jin Guilu, Wu Dehua, and Zeng Ruhai were all injured. Others are still under investigation. Subsequently, a responsible official from the Public Works Department arrived and met with Regiment Commander Xie, expressing extreme regret. The barbed wire fence erected by the White Russians was not built according to regulations and was ordered to be demolished immediately. The incident at the Lone Army Camp ended at that point.

Regiment Commander Xie told a Xinsheng News Agency reporter yesterday, "The illegal behavior of these White Russians has been repeatedly reported to the Public Works Department, hoping that they can find a way to deal with it properly. You must know that we were ordered to retreat, and we sacrificed ourselves to maintain the honor of Chinese soldiers. As long as we have breath, this determination will not change. In addition to sending personnel to investigate and express respect and condolences to the injured citizens, we urge them to quickly provide details of their injuries, as well as their names and addresses." The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that the barbed wire fence around the Jiaozhou Road Lone Army Detention Camp caused a slight disturbance this afternoon (the 12th) when it was being repaired. The Lone Army shouted loudly to protest the repair of the barbed wire fence, and passersby gathered outside the camp, shouting in sympathy with the Lone Army and throwing a few bricks. However, they were dispersed by the White Russian team of the International Volunteer Corps stationed at the camp. At the same time, the Gordon Road police station received the news and sent police to assist in maintaining order. The disturbance subsided, and no one was arrested.

### Ministry of Works Bureau: Chamber of Commerce Annual Report (Continued from yesterday), Year 1939

In my opinion, the overall performance for the year cannot be considered passing. The course content included: one lecture on the theory of dispersing rioters; two practical exercises on dispersing rioters; one lecture on the theory of street fighting; a street fighting practice session; and two lectures on platoon tactics using sand table exercises. The above subjects were considered the bare minimum. Since all members were forcibly required to attend cadre training classes, the number of exercises must have exceeded the prescribed minimum. The number of exercises for commanders of all levels and unit adjutants was even greater. As for the platoon leaders, in addition to attending the cadre training, they also had to pay attention to the following: (1) sand table method; (2) laying sandbags and installing barbed wire; (3) reviewing weapon usage. In addition, the headquarters also opened a weekend training class for new recruits and two strategic training classes. The trainees participated enthusiastically and performed very well. Before the various training classes established by the headquarters ended, the team training was also actively carried out. The activities of the teams in October and November of the previous year seemed to have broken previous records. The results of the cadre training classes for each team were remarkable. In addition, weapons training (including bayonet fighting techniques), exercises, lectures, horsemanship, and various special training were also intensified. The Signals Corps and Team B had special training, which was guided by British military personnel. The American Machine Gun Team, under the guidance of personnel dispatched by the 4th Regiment of the US Navy, opened another training class. The above-mentioned practical exercises in dispersing rioters and street fighting were often held on the streets of the central district with the cooperation of the Chief of the Police Department of the Ministry of Works Bureau.

Shooting and Encampment

In previous years, each member was required to complete a shooting course and obtain a certain score to be considered qualified. However, last year, this course was temporarily suspended due to the fact that members had participated in dispersing rioters and street fighting exercises, which took a lot of time, and also due to rising arms prices. Although shooting at the open-air target range was greatly restricted, the results of the .22 caliber live ammunition target shooting were excellent. At the beginning of last year, the American authorities supplied eight .22 caliber rifles to the American Team. Encampments for each team started last month. The location was the permanent camp at the target range during the day, and the lecture hall at the headquarters at night. Camping was also inside the headquarters. The working hours of most teams were longer than in previous years. Special training courses were taught on Saturday afternoons from 2:00 PM to 7:30 PM, and on Sunday mornings from 6:45 AM to 6:30 PM. Although the number of shooting drills was reduced due to restrictions on arms allocation, more time was spent on major courses such as stacking sandbags, installing barbed wire, strategic exercises, and dispersing rioters exercises. The number of people participating in the encampment exceeded half of the records of previous years.

(II) Russian Team

Routine Work

Last year, the Russian Team of the Chamber of Commerce still resided in the two houses rented from the Central Bank. In terms of the team's current tasks, they can be considered suitable, but the maintenance of the houses is not very economical, and they are crowded and insufficient. However, due to the lack of other suitable dormitories, they have no choice but to continue living there. Training was greatly reduced last year, because the number of people on duty every day increased, and the team's quota was insufficient, so few members could participate in training. As for the training of new recruits, it became a difficult problem due to lack of training grounds. However, the overall performance of all team members in exercises and emergency deployments was good. Special attention was paid to training in dispersing rioters and street fighting. The Russian team members patrolled the streets for a total of 1,367 hours throughout the year, including foot patrols, truck patrols, and escorting armored vehicles. Street guard duty totaled 308 hours. From August 9th to 15th, the team was ordered to mobilize and perform special duties. The number of days of guard duty throughout the year was nine days.

Assisting the Police

In the first half of last year, the team served at night, and still assisted the police at any time. The total number of times throughout the year was 25, with each time ranging from 30 to 100 people. On February 25th, the team assisted the police in searching the docks on the Bund, requiring 70 people each day. This work was the most laborious and continues to this day, but the number of people has decreased slightly. Since July 25th, the team has allocated armored vehicle drivers to the police. This task has assigned almost all drivers to the police, so the group had to hire drivers from car rental companies for all of the transportation vehicles. Since the number of drivers was insufficient, some armored vehicle drivers had to work 12 to 16 hours a day.

Honor Guard

The Russian team has sent honor guards to line up and pay respects on 18 occasions throughout the year when foreign diplomats and senior naval and military officers visited the Director-General of the Ministry of Works Bureau.

Recruitment and Treatment

In terms of the recruitment of Russian team members, last year's results were the worst. Although the number of team members was allowed to exceed the quota by ten, there were sometimes more than 30 vacancies. The number of suitable talents the team wanted to recruit was limited, and the need for such talents in this port increased. The duties of each team member were heavy, and the time for exercise and entertainment was very short. In addition, the number of team members assigned by the police was also more than in previous years. Based on these reasons, recruitment became difficult. But currently, the team is at full strength. The physical standards of applicants have been slightly reduced in order to achieve the goal. Performances of dispersing rioters and street fighting techniques were held 12 times. For stacking sandbags and installing barbed wire, instructors from each team were assigned to explain. It was found that the talent that the Russian Team wanted to recruit was in great demand externally. Employers have increased their salaries. As for the team members, their salaries were inferior. The life of the team members as soldiers was relatively simple. The string band has stopped due to lack of practice time. Team members were also unable to participate in various sports activities. Team members were generally good at boxing, but fewer people participated than before due to lack of training time. At the end of recent years, the treatment of team members has been improved, so there have been more applicants. The current service regulations seem appropriate. The physique and discipline of each team member are excellent. (To be continued)

### Gambling Dens in Nanshi Open One After Another; Hua Hui (Lottery) and Listening Devices are Everywhere

Since the opening of Nanshi, gangsters, gamblers, and local merchants have seized the opportunity to be active. Gambling dens for Hua Hui (Lottery) and listening devices have been established one after another and are everywhere. They openly hang up signs, calling on ignorant citizens, and those who are lured and lose their fortunes are countless. Subsequently, during the Lunar New Year holiday, gambling dens were also opened in the City Temple and Nine Acre Field. However, due to traffic relations in the city, the scale and capital were small, and they were all run by local gangsters. However, No. 725 Zhaojia Road, Lao Ximen, formerly the Daquanfu Restaurant, has spacious houses. Yesterday, red paper slips were posted at the door with the words "For the use of Dafu Company." It is said that in the near future, Gao A'gen, a gambler from West Shanghai, will come forward to open a gambling den. In addition, the Wang family's residence at No. 1451 Zhonghua Road and the Gonghe Cinema at No. 1603 Zhonghua Road at Lao Ximen, and the original site of Little World at No. 234 Fuyou Road in the city will all open huge gambling dens. At the same time, local business owners in the Nine Acre Field area are actively planning to resume business immediately. Therefore, Nanshi after the opening, due to its proximity to the concession, will become a second bad place, and its harmful effects are unimaginable.

### Two Offenders Sentenced to Imprisonment for Pimping

Shi Arong, a woman from Changshu, was recently lured to Shanghai by Gao Huachun, who was on the run in his hometown, and lived in the house of her fellow villager Tu Rende in Fahua Township. Between January 27th, Shi was transferred to Zhang Youliang and Shi Rongtao, both from Changshu, who opened rooms in two hotels, Rongfa on Avenue Edward VII and the Railroad Inn on Avenue Haig, intending to sell Shi into a private brothel in the French Concession. While Zhang and Shi were taking the opportunity to have sexual relations with Shi several times, Hua Tanmu Wang Jinshou of the Hui Si Police Department learned of the matter and went to Room 25 of the Railroad Inn to arrest Zhang Youliang and Shi Rongtao, along with the suspect Feng Genrong and Shi. They were all taken to the police station and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation, awaiting judgment. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu requested severe punishment. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi came to the Third Criminal Court and sentenced Zhang Youliang and Shi Rongtao to one year of imprisonment as a warning. Feng Genrong was released. The woman Shi Arong was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for care.

### Couple Arrested and Interrogated for Abusing Adopted Daughter

Gu Shunbao, a Wuxi native who lives in a bungalow at No. 119 Wuzhou Road and works as a coppersmith, brought a six-year-old girl, Juying, to Shanghai with his wife, Yuan, who returned to her hometown on January 23rd of this year, as an adopted daughter. However, the Gu couple were quite violent and often abused the girl. If she didn't please them, they would not only beat her frequently, but also burn her feet with coal balls, causing the girl to be covered in scars. The sound of her crying was heard every day. The neighbors couldn't bear to see it and tried to dissuade them to no avail. On the night of the Lunar New Year's Eve, the Gu couple used their old tricks again. Neighbors Feng Chen, Ye, and Tan secretly reported to the Jiaxing Road Police Department, which sent Detective Xu Yongyuan to bring the Gu couple and Juying to the police station. Juying was ordered to be sent to the Shanghai Sanatorium. It was found that there were burns on both feet and arms, so the Gu couple were taken into custody and sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted them for the crime of injury under Article 286 of the Criminal Code, and stated the facts of the case, saying that the girl Juying was seriously injured and still needed treatment, and requested a postponement. Then, witnesses Feng Chen, Ye, and Tan testified everything, and Juying also confessed to the abuse. When questioned, Gu Shunbao and Gu Yuan said that Juying was their biological daughter and not an adopted daughter, and denied the abuse. Judge Xiao Peishen ruled that the two defendants be detained and interrogated again in seven days.

### Letter

To the Editor,

I am writing to you on behalf of Mr. Zhu Wentao of No. 22 Diecun, Yuyuan Road, who claims that he recently read a news item in the Shen Bao entitled "Two People Kidnapped in Diecun, Yuyuan Road," which is not in accordance with the facts. The Zhu sisters mentioned in the Shen Bao are my sisters, who are both studying at school and have no outside contact. They have never set foot in a dance hall. On the evening of the 11th of this month, a conflict occurred between the resident of No. 24 of the same village and a driver, which was investigated by the police and found to be completely unrelated to my sisters. The police officer who made the false report was severely reprimanded. As for the so-called kidnapping, it is also unfounded. I am afraid that the rumors are untrue and affect the reputation of my sisters. I respectfully request your lawyer to send a letter to the Shen Bao requesting a correction. Respectfully, Lawyer Zhou Bingyang, February 12th.

### Finance: Rumor of Gold Reserve in Tianjin Triggers a Huge Rally; Spot Cash Sees a Peak of 4,625 Yuan

Yesterday's spot cash (smelted silver) market was initially sharply lower due to a report that a large new loan had been established between China and the United States, once hitting a low of 4,345 yuan. Unexpectedly, a rally followed, and by the evening it had broken through the 4,600 yuan mark. This was due to the foreign exchange market first loosening and then tightening, coupled with numerous rumors in the market, and a sudden rumor in the afternoon that the Tianjin Joint Reserve Bank intended to use gold as a reserve at a price of 4,700 yuan per tael. As a result, the Tianjin gang was particularly active, and the Hong Kong gang also searched for it from time to time, so that many local households held on tightly and refused to let go. There were also many who added to their positions. The initial opening was extremely sluggish, with a price of 4,350 yuan, 40 yuan lower than before the holiday, because the foreign exchange report was firm. Gold shops sold hard, falling to 4,345 yuan. Then the foreign exchange market turned soft, and HSBC had a particularly good appetite. Suddenly, many bullish rumors arose in the market, and those who heard them were shocked and immediately bought. Securities firms added to their absorption, and Hong Kong firms also tracked and searched. Retail investors also bought, and the price soared. By the midday close, it had reached 4,475 yuan. In the afternoon, the above-mentioned rumors suddenly arose, and it was heard that foreign exchange continued to tighten. People's hearts became more and more firm. The Tianjin, Hong Kong, and local gangs commissioned brokers in the market to buy on their behalf. Although a certain gold shop was willing to sell at a high price, it was not enough to grab. By the evening close, it had jumped to a peak of 4,605 yuan, resulting in a sharp increase of 215 yuan compared to before the holiday. The market became even stronger after the close, rising another 20 yuan. Trading was very active throughout the day, above 2,500 taels. Silver jewelry shops hung up high by 20 yuan. Customs gold was still flat.

Smelted Silver Rises by More Than 200 Yuan

Since this morning, the price per tael (ten liang) initially opened 40 yuan lower due to negative news in the report and a firm foreign exchange rate. Silver shops and gold shops mutually suppressed prices and sold, causing the market to open 40 yuan lower. The gold shop sold 20 taels to the currency exchange business for 4,350 yuan. Later, the securities business dragged in, and the currency exchange business also bought in, and it soon recovered 25 yuan. The securities business entered 20 taels of the currency exchange business for 4,375 yuan. Later, another currency exchange business suddenly came to fill in, and the gold shop came out to spit out again, and it became even smaller by 30 yuan. The gold shops did 20 taels of mutual trading for 4,345 yuan. Because the foreign exchange rate was soft, people's hearts suddenly changed. A certain currency exchange business and securities business scrambled to buy in, and retail investors also dragged in. The positions immediately felt that demand exceeded supply, and the price rebounded by 75 yuan, breaking through the 4,400 yuan mark. The spot cash shop entered 20 taels of the silver shop business for 4,420 yuan. At that time, currency exchange businesses and retail investors recovered a little, and the price returned slightly by 15 yuan. The currency exchange business sold 20 taels to the gold shop for 4,405 yuan. In the end, because the foreign exchange report was soft, the buying momentum rose again. Spot cash shops and a certain silver shop entered one after another. Soon, the Hong Kong gang suddenly became active and entrusted a certain silver building and a certain gold shop to buy on their behalf. Although the silver shop gang and retail investors came to block, the positions were ultimately difficult to match, and then soared by 70 yuan. A certain silver shop entered 20 taels from a certain silver number for 4,475 yuan as the midday closing price. In the afternoon, the initial opening rose by 5 yuan. The currency exchange business entered 20 taels of the gold shop for 4,480 yuan. Later, because the foreign exchange report was soft, the securities business had a strong appetite. At the same time, a certain currency exchange business also searched for the Tianjin gang, soaring by 70 yuan. The securities business entered 30 taels from a certain silver number for 4,550 yuan. Later, the silver shop gang spat out a little, and once retraced 30 yuan. The currency exchange business released 20 taels to the securities business for 4,520 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop suddenly dragged in on behalf of the Hong Kong gang. At the same time, a certain silver number also searched and bought on behalf of the customer, and then soared by 80 yuan. A certain silver number entered 30 taels from the gold shop for 4,600 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop suddenly had a strong willingness to sell, and a lot was blocked. The foreign exchange market was slightly firm, causing a decline of 75 yuan. The gold shop released 10 taels to the currency exchange business for 4,525 yuan. After entering, the gold shop stopped selling and the buying momentum rose again. Currency exchange businesses, securities businesses, and a certain silver number scrambled to drag, but most of the sellers were helpless. In an instant, it soared by 80 yuan. The gold shop entered 10 taels from the securities business for 4,605 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it was 250 yuan higher than before the holiday. After the close, a certain silver number entered again, and it rose to 4,625 yuan. The total day's volatility was 260 yuan. The sale price of the main brand gold of the spot cash shop was 10 yuan higher than that of smelted silver, and the purchase price was reduced by more than 20 yuan. The spot gold was about 60 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Listed at Higher Exchange Rate

Initially, the exchange rate for silver jewelry per liang was still 445 yuan at Datonghang. At 9:30, it was listed at 5 yuan lower. At 10:30, it recovered 5 yuan. At 11:10, it was listed at 5 yuan higher. At 2:05 PM, it was listed at 5 yuan higher again. After a moment, it was listed at 5 yuan higher again. At 3:35, it was listed 5 yuan higher again. As a result, it was listed at 20 yuan higher in total. Datonghang changed the listing to 465 yuan. The new colleagues had the same price as the previous one. The purchases were reduced by 15 to 20 yuan. The exchange rate for pure silver at Datonghang was raised by two jiao per liang, changing it to four yuan.

### Gold Pound Soars Alone: Up Seven and a Half Dollars from Before the Holiday

Yesterday, British and American gold pounds rose sharply due to rumors that the Tianjin "Federal Reserve" bank would use gold as its reserve.

The market price of British and American gold notes also strengthened due to renewed discussions about issuing gold coin certificates. In the morning, the price of British gold notes was fifty-one yuan, and American gold notes were thirteen yuan and seventy-two cents. The upward trend intensified in the afternoon. In the evening market, British gold notes rose to fifty-one yuan and seventy-five cents, and American gold notes rose to thirteen yuan and ninety-eight cents.

### HSBC and Sassoon Purchase Heavily: Foreign Exchange Market Tightens Again

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's official exchange rate remained unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates initially showed some hardening, but ultimately continued to tighten. The reason was that favorable rumors suddenly arose, and HSBC absorbed when prices were low. Therefore, the market could not loosen. Reports that a new Sino-American loan had been established were an earlier factor in Chinese merchants selling off. As for the day's events: the morning opened slightly harder, at four ban shi four zero six two five and seven yuan three one two five. Subsequently, speculative merchants and Chinese banks such as Dongya and Zhejiang jointly sold, and foreign banks such as Datong and Huabi were eager to supply, causing British gold to quickly harden further to four ban shi four six eight seven five, and American exchange rates also eased to seven yuan four three seven five. Later, HSBC's appetite suddenly improved, absorbing a considerable amount, and unfounded favorable news spread, causing Sassoon and others to buy in, and foreign firms' buying interest also arose, causing the market to tighten. By about eleven o'clock, it had softened to four ban shi three seven five and seven yuan two five. At noon, fewer were buying, and the situation began to stabilize. By the afternoon closing, it had recovered slightly, to four ban shi three nine zero six two five and seven yuan two eight one two five. In the afternoon, Chinese merchants bought back in, and foreign firms continued to settle cotton and wheat, plus foreign banks' appetite was also good, causing it to tighten again to four ban shi three one two five and seven yuan one two five. Afterward, Sassoon took advantage of the high prices to sell off slightly, resulting in a turnaround. By the evening closing, it was four ban shi three six one two five and seven yuan one five six two five, which was tighter by zero six two five for British compared to the previous holiday's close, and softer by one two five for American. The potential trend in futures was no different from the spot market.

Opening Fairly Sold Off

Early morning: London's short-term big bars were down four three seven five recently, and long-term fell by half a ban shi. New York silver prices remained flat, and London's raw gold remained fixed. Exchange rates for British versus American, Shanghai, and French were all flat; American versus British narrowed eight seven five, versus Shanghai unchanged, versus French small three seven five (all based on closing before the holiday). The Central Bank's official exchange rates for each currency remained the same. Bank's morning opening spot selling prices: British gold four ban shi four zero six two five, American exchange seven yuan three one two five. Compared to before the holiday, British was looser zero one five six two five, and American was longer zero three one two five. After opening, due to unfavorable news reports, speculative merchants first sold off, and Chinese banks followed suit, plus foreign banks such as Datong and Huabi also had a supply intention, so the market continued to harden. Although a certain bank's appetite was still good, by nine twenty-five, British gold had grown to four ban shi four six eight seven five, and American exchange had also hardened to seven yuan four three seven five. HSBC's official exchange rate remained unchanged. The white silver balance tax announcement fell two-thirds of a cent. After that, HSBC suddenly saw low prices and aggressively absorbed two-month futures, and Sassoon also bought, so the position turned out to be more in demand than supply, and the market immediately turned. HSBC absorbed this month's American exchange from fellow banks from seven yuan three seven five to tight two five. At the same time, Sassoon also purchased favorable this month's American exchange at seven yuan three one two five from foreign banks. At that time, the spot price also softened to four ban shi four zero six two five and seven yuan three one two five. Later, foreign firms also tracked down and settled, and foreign bank Huabi suddenly bought in, so the situation continued to soften. By eleven twenty-five, British gold had shrunk to four ban shi three seven five, and American exchange had also tightened to seven yuan two five. At noon, fewer were buying, and the situation turned flat. By the noon close, it had recovered slightly, with British gold at four ban shi three nine zero six two five, and American exchange calculated at seven yuan two eight one two five, which was tighter zero one five six two five for British and softer zero three one two five for American compared to the morning opening.

Chinese Merchants Buy Futures

The afternoon market initially remained flat. Then, Chinese merchants and foreign firms came to buy futures, plus foreign banks Datong and Huabi all had appetites, so the market trend resumed softening. By two fifty, British gold had shrunk to four ban shi three one two five, and American exchange had also tightened to seven yuan one two five. Shortly thereafter, Sassoon's bulls took advantage of the high prices to come out again, and soon returned to four ban shi three four three seven five and seven yuan one eight seven five. After entering, the selling trend did not continue, and it again showed weakness. By the evening closing, British gold was four ban shi three two eight one two five, and American exchange was calculated at seven yuan one five six two five. This month's British gold was four ban shi three one two five, and American exchange was seven yuan one two five. Next month's futures: British gold four ban shi two five, American exchange seven yuan. As a result, current-term British was tighter zero six two five, and American was softer one two five in each category compared to before the holiday.

### Securities: Foreign Stocks in a Frenzy of Speculation: The Only Real Profits in the Future Are Feared to Be Those Already Cashed Out

On the fifth and sixth of this month (lunar calendar 28th and 29th), the enthusiasm of foreign merchant stock transactions at the Public Industry Exchange and the soaring of various stock prices were truly unprecedented. This is the common psychology that after the red opening, the prices of various stocks will soar even higher. Yesterday, it came true, and this two-day foreign stock market situation will be used as a reference for the future.

(A) Industrial Stocks: The general situation of industrial stocks is very good. Among them, (A) silver companies are particularly active. Shanghai Silver Company is firmly at the twenty yuan mark, and Yangtze Silver Company has also seen a new high price of seventeen yuan and two jiao. Huizhong Silver Company is also standing at two yuan and two jiao. (B) Public Utilities: The telephone company saw a new high price of twenty-eight yuan and a half, and the water and electricity also saw a high price of eighteen yuan and two jiao. Public buses also exceeded twenty-eight yuan. (C) Shipyards: Since Yiesong Shipyard has seen a high price of three hundred and twenty yuan, the Ruirong Shipyard has also soared to thirty yuan and a half. The transaction volume is large, and buyers were particularly strong at the close. After the two companies merged into British United Shipyards, Yiesong shares were exchanged for nine new shares, and Ruirong shares were exchanged for one share. Then the two shares will be in a ratio of one to nine. Yiesong saw a price of three hundred and twenty yuan, then Ruirong should be thirty-five yuan according to the ratio. Jardine Matheson is also firmly at eighty-five yuan. (D) Real Estate: Yep Kwong Real Estate soared to a peak of nineteen yuan on the 5th. Due to many people taking profits, the price was slightly weak. The closing price on the 6th was eighteen yuan three four jiao, and the buying interest was very strong. There is a lot of rumors in the market. Those with sensitive information said that the negotiations on building roads across the border have been successful, and the restoration of Hongkou to the pre-war situation is approaching. Yep Kwong's properties are all in Hongkou, so the price has risen. It is said that it is not without reason. China General Store stood at a price of ten yuan two jiao, and the transaction volume was very large. (E) Spinning Mills: Jardine Matheson Spinning Mill firmly stood at thirty-seven yuan and a half of the original disc, and the transaction volume was very large. (F) Insurance: Si Hai Insurance created a new high price of sixteen yuan four jiao, which is a spectacle. (G) Others: Xiangtai Timber Store fifty-five yuan disc, steel industry is also firm, there are transactions at twenty-four yuan. China Reclamation rose to a high price of thirteen yuan and two jiao on the morning of the 6th. After many people took profits, the price fell back. The closing price was twelve yuan six jiao. (H) Rubber Stocks: Singapore and New York production areas reported rising prices, and foreign exchange has been shrinking in recent days, which has enabled rubber stocks to have a golden situation. Large stocks such as Lange Zhi had transactions at thirty-four yuan and a half, and rubber also reached a high price of thirty-six yuan and a half. Among the small stocks, Na Wang flew over the top and quickly created the highest price of three yuan four jiao. Dibang also had a large transaction volume, with a price of two yuan six jiao and a half. Botu Ananda two yuan eight jiao, and Liber closed at two yuan four jiao and a half.

Under today's speculative situation, the speed of stock prices flying over is rare. It is difficult to fall back for a while. After the European War, a large number of funds from various places escaped to Shanghai, and were used for both investment and speculation, resulting in the recent situation. (Stone)

Yesterday's stock market at the Public Industry Exchange: due to the rise in rubber prices at home and abroad during the holiday, the rising trend of rubber stocks has a huge driving force. The opening market situation was excited and trended higher. Subsequently, taking profits arose, and the price softened slightly. However, all the stocks that came out were absorbed at a good price, and the closing buying interest was still strong. The sales side's strength was relatively clumsy, and the price was not much different from the highest point in the day. Industrial stocks were not developed, and the public's interest in this was far inferior to rubber stocks. Prices were roughly the same as before the holiday.

This newspaper received a letter to Shanghai speculators signed by Mr. Xinyi, which said, "Since the National Army moved west, Shanghai has become the only market in the country for hoarding and speculation. Speculation in rice, wheat, oil, coal, cotton yarn, flour, etc. will not be discussed for the time being. Recently, stock speculation has become as drunk as it is, and it is getting worse and worse. If this continues, all the funds of the Chinese will flow into the hands of Western merchants. It is estimated that it has reached more than 50 million yuan. The business of the stock market is limited, and the original intention is to solve floating capital and invest in profit, and the selection is very strict, and the fluctuations are very small. If the current situation is followed, it can be regarded as a kind of bargaining chip, and the profit and loss are not calculated. Rubber stocks: due to the outbreak of the European War, raw rubber soared, and the profit is beyond any business. The stock price bought three months ago is an unparalleled investment. If the current market price is followed, this kind of high profit has been lost. Stocks calculated in foreign currency are barely satisfactory. Stocks in Shanghai currency can only get six or seven percent interest. Such as Chen, Clinton, Sinar Wang, Bo Heng, Bai Tu Anna, Libai, Ximenbu, etc., are even below this number. If there is hope for peace in the European War, the price of rubber and the change in exchange rates must also be taken into account. Moreover, according to past traces, no one buys in when it is tired, which is also worthy of attention. Shanghai Silver Company: according to the recent balance sheet sent by the company, even the undistributed interest reserve and the discounted gold are only worth a little more than 16 yuan. The Yangtze Silver Company also announced that it is worth about 15 yuan, but the market is actually buying at a very high price, one is 20 yuan zero seven jiao five points, and the other is 17 yuan. This crazy state is puzzling. International Trust cannot use the report as a buying and selling standard, because the property that has not been sold cannot be regarded as profit. If the property benefits and income are distributed to the ticket holders, the income will be even less. In Yep Kwong Real Estate Company, there is a rumor that Hongkou will be opened, but now it proves that the negotiation has failed, but the stock is raised to 18 yuan, which is really incomprehensible. China General Store Company may not have any interest to pay in the past 11 or 12 years, but there are many hopes. Other companies that have not exceeded the par value or bought in because the real estate business is developing. Ruirong Yiesong had cheap inventory last year and made huge profits. This year, due to the exhaustion of inventory, the price of hardware is expensive, and the number of foreign ships arriving in Shanghai for repairs has decreased. Therefore, the benefits to be gained by those who buy in at this high price are already very small. Kaiping stocks: compared with the previous settlement, the donations and expenses have increased compared with the past. London's market price is not moving, the company's delay in paying interest, and Shanghai's continuous raising of prices to buy in are really excessive. The Reclamation Company is still in the flood, and no coal was mined in January. Moreover, due to regional reasons, it cannot get a good price. If Shanghai is now buying in at a price of 13 yuan, I don't know what is expected. Steel companies must calculate the amount of inventory as a standard. Deli Feng, public buses, and water and electricity companies have good business, but the benefits are less than the bank's deposit interest. Jardine Matheson Spinning Mill had cheap raw materials last year when the currency value changed, and the profits were not small. If the current situation is followed, the flowers are expensive and the yarn is cheap. The profits are only the same as those in Shanghai before the war. Then you can remember the interest distribution before the war. If compared with property, it should have a value of 37 yuan. Then why is Chongxin, whose machines and products are better than Jardine Matheson, still around 50 yuan? In short, if you can study the business situation, compare interest income, and prepare for the decline, you can buy in. I would rather deposit the surplus funds in the bank to earn interest, or arbitrage exchange, which will not damage the original capital. The real profiteers today are those who sell out. If they still hold high-priced stocks, I am afraid they are also in an uncertain situation. (Xinyi)

### Domestic Debt Slightly Tired: The Trend is Still Optimistic

The unofficial securities market started red market trading yesterday, and everything was still done according to the usual practice. Because it was still a custom to do half-day trading during the New Year holiday, the market was closed in the afternoon. Public debt market conditions were quite tired during the holiday period due to rumors in Nanjing, and it happened to be after the interest was paid. The red market was even more because Category A had been drawn for calculation, and most households were bullish on the New Year. When Category C was first made, it had been out of the eight yuan mark. However, because gold had risen again sharply, people's hearts were tired, and bulls were pouring out. Although the new loan of US$20 million between China and the United States was established, the market situation was still weak due to the crowding of bulls. This trend is a temporary phenomenon and is completely caused by floating bulls. Guan Xinfu bought in constantly on behalf of a certain bank, and the purchase of Nos. 14 and 16 was very strong. Although Category A has been drawn, it has fallen too much. There will inevitably be eaters soon, and the future is still optimistic. The market fell a small amount from two jiao half to four jiao. Category A fell sharply by as much as one yuan and nine jiao half due to the removal of the lottery. The total turnover was more than 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading, Chinese merchant stocks have not yet had a formal transaction.

### Yarn and Flowers: Yarn Prices Rise Slightly Poorly, but Twin Horses Raised to 780 Yuan in the Afternoon

The red market opening of spot yarn after the Spring Festival holiday was unusually stable. Because the actual demand has not seen a huge development, and at the same time, the foreign exchange situation was still stable in the morning, people's hearts were at ease. There are also some thoughts that are small. Only, in general, those outside the industry have a very firm will to hoard due to loose finances. The goods that have been dragged in are always unwilling to be released. As for the actual sales, the development period is still early. The current problem is still to do the expansion and contraction on the exchange rate.

The opening price of 20-count Twin Horse on the morning of the spot yarn market was already expensive at the end of last year. That is, most of the industry tends to sell out. Therefore, although the shouting price was high, it could not be traded. The 20-count Twin Horse opened at 768 yuan. It was heard that the exchange rate was issued, and the micro-see grew longer, and then it fell again, falling to 762 yuan and a half. However, the financial world came to buy again, and it rose again to a closing of 764 yuan. But after the close, it rose another step, doing 770 yuan. And in the afternoon, it was affected by the exchange rate change and shrinking, and the market price rose sharply. 20-count Twin Horse did 20 package transactions, and the price was 780 yuan, which was a huge jump of 16 yuan compared to the closing price in the market. It was found that the transaction statistics for half a day in the morning were 1,395 packages, the Tiannv price rose by 5 yuan, the Twin Earth price rose by 6 yuan, and the coarse yarn price rose by 67 yuan. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed separately on the left.

### Flower Prices Rise 5 Yuan: Manufacturers Have Not Yet Started

The opening price of the cotton red market rose by 56 yuan, and people's hearts were very good. This is because the inventory is gradually thinning, and the sources from various routes are not strong. Therefore, although Indian cotton is tired, American cotton is expensive again, and the pricing calculation is not clear, plus the exchange rate is softening. However, the manufacturers have not yet started. Only 390 packages have arrived from the source in northern Jiangsu. The transaction price of spot cotton is listed on the left.

Another message: The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, has been quite stable in recent days. The price has risen by more than 10 pounds compared to before the closing. Although the selling of the southern gangs is active, the spot trading is also very lively. The Indian cotton market has also been quiet in recent days. Yesterday's forecast price fell by more than 5 Robi compared to the closing. Egypt also fell slightly by more than 10 pounds. Liverpool has no great difference.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading: No transactions were heard to be opened in the red market yesterday. The reason is that there are rumors that a new loan between China and the United States has been established, and the opinions of various industries are that the exchange rate may loosen, and people's hearts are weak because of this. It is said that the selling price of red cotton cloth is quite high, but the cotton yarn is more stagnant. The general prediction is that the yarn price will turn good in the coming days, and the foreign cotton trading will be active along with it. No new transactions from the manufacturers have been heard to be opened, and the same is true for the Japanese manufacturers. The ex-factory price converted from American exchange at 7.25 yuan yesterday is as follows.

### Food: Flour, Wheat, Oil, and Beans: Unofficial Market Soars

Flour

Yesterday was the opening of the Spring Festival holiday. In order to maintain the food supply for the citizens of this city, the factory price had not been increased. It is said that the authorities in the concession, taking into account the livelihood of the common people, restricted the flour market from rising again. It is said that the factory had agreed to maintain it for a month. However, in fact, it is difficult to buy even dozens of bags at this price from the factory. This is inevitably too deceiving, and the unofficial market is rising endlessly. It is heard that the Luning Zhan bill has risen to 13.5 yuan, and the Lao Che Zhan bill has also reached a peak of 13 yuan, which is more than 1 yuan higher than last year. The Phoenix brand in February opened at 12 yuan 6 jiao 7 points. How can the future of the people be imagined? Today, 3,800 bags were shipped to Tianjin.

Wheat

Yesterday, the Miscellaneous Grain Association market was operating as usual. Various oils, beans, and miscellaneous grains all rose sharply, and wheat did not open due to environmental reasons. Because the flour mills are now acting cautiously, the factory price is not increased. For the eating price of raw materials, they are not willing to overpay for purchases. The goods owners are only willing to keep the goods, and the prices are getting higher and higher, so the two sides are temporarily holding back. It is heard that the Fuxin factory has ordered another ship of foreign wheat during the Spring Festival holiday, with an amount of about 7,000 tons, and the price is 18 yuan. Although foreign wheat is being transported to Shanghai in a steady stream, there is no possibility of lowering the price of flour and wheat, which is really dominated by the general bad environment.

Oil Market

Yesterday, the oil market red market, the market price of soybean oil and peanut oil rose by 456 yuan, compared with before the holiday. The overall situation was restricted by various environmental factors, and the footing was firm, with more rises than falls. Yesterday's market was a red market fortune business, and most of the transactions were social. Therefore, all of the transactions were opened in the morning market. By the afternoon, the buying interest was tight, and the supply could not meet the demand. As a result, there was a market with no market (unofficially raised 23 yuan). According to statistics, the transaction volume of the factory's own soybean oil was 240 dan. For detailed market prices, see the market price column. Yanqi soybean oil 250 pieces, Qingqi soybean oil 200 pieces, Jiaozhou soybean oil 300 pieces, Dalian soybean oil 1,400 barrels, Jiangbei soybean oil 20 barrels, and peanut oil Jiaozhou Road goods 600 pieces, Yantai oil 1,500 listening, Tianjin oil 200 listening, Qingdao oil 50 barrels, Jiangbei oil 1,800 listening.

Miscellaneous Grains

Red market trading was not excited. Because the guest gangs were not moving, only the local gang opened the market. The price of yellow beans rose alone, and the market price rose by 23 yuan, compared with before the holiday. 60 bags of Dasu beans were opened, and the price was 26 yuan. 200 bags of Qingdao beans, and the price was 26 yuan 2 jiao. 320 bags of Dingjia Zhou beans, and the price was from 24 yuan 5 jiao to 24 yuan. 100 bags of Wuhu yellow beans, and the price was 22 yuan 5 jiao. 140 bags of Jiangbei beans, and the price was 22 yuan 6 jiao, and Nanjing beans were 1 car, and the price was 23 yuan 2 jiao. Zhunqiu beans were 1 car, and the price was 20 yuan zero 5 jiao.

### Coal: Smoke and White Coal Red Plate Rise Together

The coal market opened yesterday, and the smoke and white coal red plate rose together. In particular, the smoke coal rose more sharply due to the scarcity of the source of Kaiping. According to the statistics, the industry's demolition of Indian smoke coal was 200 yuan per ton, and the pellets were the same, rising by 40 yuan. Kaiping coal was 180 yuan, and the rise in white coal was slower. Hongji white coal was 155 yuan per ton, and the pellets were 150 yuan. The warehouse's delivery of goods will be added separately. The coal ball factory price also rose by 14 yuan. According to the statistics, the coal balls such as Yitaixing, Fuyang, and Guohua were 110 yuan per ton from the car, 112 yuan delivered, and the retail price at the door was 5 yuan 8 jiao per dan.

### Third Talk on Wang

— Huang Jiayin

In a short piece of social news, if you add a detailed investigation and analysis, you can often find a tragic story and serious social problems.

Talking about the Wang who was arrested for using his twelve-year-old twin sons to sue the land and beg, this is the third time. The reason is: I still have more to say after talking about it twice before.

Last time, I talked about Wang committing a crime because he was economically oppressed, calling it the "crime of poverty". The intention was not to defend Wang or try to reduce Wang's crime, but to point out the majority of similar social tragedies from a painful fact, thereby providing a serious social problem that urgently needs to be solved.

The inequality of wealth, the extreme increase in living standards, the harsh environment, and the lack of reasonable education can be said to be the main reasons for all crimes in today's society. It may not be easy to fundamentally solve all these problems at once. Therefore, we cannot but retreat and seek the next best thing.

If we don't want the source of crime to continue and the criminals to continue, then we should, for the poor worms like Wang who commit crimes due to economic oppression, at least after serving their sentences, like parents teaching babies to walk, help them find a legitimate occupation, assist them in adapting to social life, and guide them to abandon evil and return to righteousness. Otherwise, thirty days of imprisonment will not only be in vain, but I am afraid it will increase Wang's resentment towards social injustice.

### Finnish Sketches

— Zhihui

Nine-tenths of Finns can read and write. The high level of Finnish culture is largely a gift of religion.

Hundreds of years ago, during the Reformation, the leaders of the Finnish Protestants, in order to enable all Finns to read for themselves the newly translated Bible and other religious books, unintentionally cultivated a good educational foundation for her later. Today, the number of books purchased by each Finn exceeds that of the people of any other country. Stockholm Bookstore in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, is regarded as the largest bookstore in the world.

In 1938, the total number of postal items passing through the Helsinki Post Office reached 350 million, not counting those delivered locally; that is to say, every Finn, regardless of age or gender, sends out an average of one hundred letters or newspapers a year.

Finland has always worshiped the autonomous system, and at least has full autonomy. Tsarist Russia placed her in a semi-colonial position; after the end of the First European War, Finland was completely liberated.

Finns are truly geniuses of languages. Many Finns can speak five languages, and most can speak two or more. They are extremely serious in attitude, but also have a sense of humor.

The honesty of the Finns is even more appreciated. Three American tourists were on a train carrying soldiers, and one of them lost a camera, but only discovered the loss after arriving at the hotel. There was no name on the camera, nor any markings that could lead to an exploration. Fifteen minutes later, a postal official arrived by car with the camera, having searched all the hotels in the small town until he heard that a new hotel was housing three American tourists!

Although many countries have consistently denied the United States' wartime loans, even Britain and France are no exception; but Finland has fully repaid them. Why is this? Finns will answer you: "That is our obligation." Obviously, they have never turned to the idea of how to default on debts.

Finland's financial budget is also often very balanced, and any supply can be raised immediately. The national debt is very stable, and in just a few years, it has accumulated a public reserve fund of 100 million Finnish marks (equivalent to 20 million US dollars).

Foreigners who set foot in this country immediately change their views. Helsinki also has ultra-modern grand hotels, and public buildings are equipped with skylights, but there are no slums.

### The Human Body's Cold Resistance

— Shi Tao

The human body temperature, that is, the temperature of the blood, if it reaches 30 degrees Celsius, then the chemical reactions in the body will stop its function, but now the medical community may be able to save those who are dying from freezing at a direct solar temperature above 26 degrees Celsius. Hunger, fatigue, and excessive alcohol are three things that can make a person prone to freezing to death earlier. If a person has all three of the above, then it is naturally easier to freeze to death.

Since ancient times, people have generally believed that drinking alcohol can make people freeze to death sooner, but if it is a small amount, alcohol can become a source of body temperature and resist extreme low temperatures. Conversely, drinking a large amount of alcohol will obviously reduce the heat resistance of alcohol.

Everyone knows that Vitamin E is a growth stimulant. From animal experiments, it can be understood that taking a large amount of Vitamin C has no significant effect on the body's cold resistance, but once Vitamin C is lacking, the body's resistance to cold will be extremely weakened. In other words, when the human body is exposed to severe cold, it is a very important thing to supplement Vitamin C. It is very reasonable to prepare things like oranges while climbing mountains and crossing borders.

What impact does habit have on low temperature? This can be proven by animal experiments. For example, placing it in a low temperature for a certain period of time every day, and then examining its blood, initially discovering "the phenomenon of increased initial white blood cells, but gradually its degree of reaction to low temperature is decreasing; if it is continuously tested for a month, its cold resistance in low temperature will naturally increase, but if the degree of daily exercise is too high - such as too long time, too low temperature - then it will not produce the phenomenon of increased cold resistance, but will produce the bad result of weakening resistance; in short, it is possible to increase the power of resistance to low temperature by using the "exercise" aspect, but it has a certain limit, and too intense exercise will weaken the power of resistance.

### A Fulfilling Life

— Aisi

Former President of Harvard University in the United States, Eliot, in his book "The Complete Life," once raised the question of how to make life eternally fulfilling. He gave three points to illustrate:

First, he believed that young people should be like a clean, useful, and brave animal. In his view, the only foundation for a fulfilling life lies in health. He believes that play is a manifestation of the instinct of small animals. He believes that playing for some time every day, or doing some physical exercise, is hygienic. However, if entertainment is taken as the main purpose of life, then you will feel bored. Entertainment is not the source of making life eternally fulfilling. Play in a fulfilling life must be occasional.

Secondly, he believes that "we need a strong mental power, a useful ability to overcome difficult work. This is the intelligence and purpose we need. In all noble professions, whether academic, scientific, or industrial, broad intelligence is needed."

Third, Eliot believes that in order to seek eternal fulfillment in life, one must cherish reputation and be a person of honor. "A person of honor must be generous, not only in terms of money, but also in terms of judgment of people and human nature. Such generosity is the beautiful characteristic of a person of honor."

How can one obtain honor? What is an honorable life? What is the final standard of honor? You seem to be waiting for your elders, such as your parents, your teachers, your senior alumni, to make good criticisms; but in fact, these elders are not your final critics, but the criticisms of your peers and descendants are very important. You will find that the criticisms of your peers have already existed very early, and the criticisms in a certain period are enough to affect the entire life history. Without your awareness, they have a permanent and definite criticism of you. This criticism is firm and cannot be changed. Finally, Eliot hopes that we will always be people who love honor from today onwards!

Essays

### The Terror of Unemployment

— Zong Qi

A few days ago, I saw an article in the newspaper about a horror star talking about horror. The meaning of the zombie king Luo Jaxi is that the most terrifying thing is unemployment. This is truly a profound experience!

People who have not been unemployed will not know the terror of unemployment.

"It" is like a zombie, with a pale, cruel, fierce, and ruthless face, appearing in the home of an unemployed person. He follows you closely and silently. You go out the door, he follows behind you. You come home, he still follows into your doorway. You fall asleep, he terrifies you like a demon in your dreams. When you wake up, he is already standing in front of your bed. He makes you lose the joy of life, he makes your wife lose that kind of feminine tenderness, he makes your children cry day and night. He forces you to become rude, he casts a gloomy shadow on your head, making you unable to lift your head.

In the cold wind of winter, he stabs you like a knife, he drills into your stomach and bites you like a venomous snake. Sometimes he forces you to do things like robbery and murder, and sometimes he tempts you to do other evil things that go against your conscience. He threatens you and oppresses you, but you have no power to resist him. In the end, he may kill you beside the road. When he first appears, you may have the strength to fight him, but he doesn't knock you down with a quick punch, but always follows you patiently and forces you to entangle you for a long time, so that you later have no strength to struggle with him and die in his cruel hands.

Even if you die, he won't let you go. He will stay in your home and continue to oppress your wife, terrify your children, and make your soul restless.

### Quintuplet Daughters Donate Money to Serve the Country

— Hua Zhi

The movement of Hollywood actresses donating money to help invaded nations is getting more and more enthusiastic. Last year, there was a movement to help China resist Japan. Since the great star Greta Garbo resolutely donated money to Finland twice (this news has been published in this publication before), other stars have followed suit. Recently, it was heard that the world-famous Canadian Dionne quintuplets will also sell their appearances and donate money to serve the country. The Dionne quintuplets will carry out a long-term donation, about five months. According to Gibbons, the chairman of the 1940 New York World's Fair Preparatory Committee, who reported to the Mayor of New York, the Dionne sisters will be publicly exhibited and perform at the fair from the opening day on May 1, and all ticket revenue will be used for the Canadian Expeditionary Force's wounded soldiers' hospital.

This heroic act has attracted the attention of all circles in New York. According to Dr. Touff, the guardian of the five sisters, the five darlings are already five years old this year and know a thing or two about patriotism. Since the Canadian Federation has decided to fight against Germany side by side with the British Empire, the people's hearts are excited, and everyone is doing their best. The five daughters' patriotic performance is also their inescapable duty.

The New York World's Fair site is in the suburbs and the location is large. The five daughters' performance hall is located in the center. This site was originally last year's "Soviet Pavilion", but since the Soviet army launched a massive invasion of Finland, Americans were very angry and completely demolished the Soviet Pavilion and rebuilt a beautiful "Five Fortunes Pavilion", surrounded by iron railings, so that whenever the audience passed by, they could see their living conditions.

The five daughters' special performance programs include freehand exercises, ball shooting, singing, jumping, and swing dancing. The most spectacular is a "human pyramid" game, which is expected to have a special appeal. After the fair closes, they will also travel around the United States to continue performing and showing loyalty to the country.

### Impressions After Watching "Daughterland"

— Qingshui

"Daughterland" began to meet with Shanghai people on the first day of the Lunar New Year. The plot is bizarre, the costumes are gorgeous, and the performance is brilliant. This is a new work recently completed by Mr. Yu Ling. Although it is called the trilogy of women with "Women's Apartment" and "Tears Splashed on Flowers," the style is completely different. The whole play is in a dream fairyland. Although it starts and ends with reality, the various forms of psychology are exposed without reservation.

In this fairyland, all women have become immortals, and immortals are the happiest, so they should be satisfied. But no, the people in Daughterland have more troubles and frustrations.

This is truly the best microcosm of the current society. Many people have so much money that they can't spend it all, but they still drill into every hole. They don't care about reputation and personality, and manipulating prices and hoarding goods is commonplace; other people suffer, what's it to me? Starving and freezing to death are deserved. There are even some people who use the fate of the entire country and nation as a tool for personal enrichment, leaving a bad name for ten thousand years and being spat upon by passersby, but they don't care. What is their intention? Only they themselves understand it in their stomachs.

There are also some people who are devoted to academic careers, using all their efforts, and achieving achievements and inventions, resulting in big bosses and capitalists becoming rich, living in Western-style houses and riding in cars, while they themselves are empty-handed and remain the same. When they are no longer needed, they are kicked away. Isn't this the Mr. Nice Guy in Daughterland? Specializing in satisfying others while oneself cannot be satisfied, no wonder Mr. Rich laughed and said: "Good people can't make money." In fact, in this evil society, it's not just "Daughterland" that is like this.

### A Few Words to Comment on "Grievances in the Boudoir"

— Zhi Ge

During the New Year's holiday, I wanted to find some happiness in the entertainment venue and indulge in a play, but I didn't expect to be overcrowded everywhere and there was no room to sit. Finally, I was invited by the "Youth Drama Club" of the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association to watch "Grievances in the Boudoir." This is a five-act comedy, which takes four hours to perform from beginning to end, but the audience is not tired at all, and it is indeed worthy of the honor of a "good play."

The plot describes a lifeless family, bound by a widowed old man with a perverse temperament, whose nine children live a painful life and are simply afraid of their father like a devil, but cannot resist, and the power of the old etiquette is described very profoundly. The whole play has a fairly strong literary flavor, and the amount of dialogue seems to be too heavy. Especially the third act can be abbreviated, so that the actors save a lot of energy, and the audience will not be too boring. I think that the script should be translated freely, without rigidly translating word by word. Extracting short dialogues from the original text and inserting funny actions, the audience will definitely increase their interest.

The acting skills are all above average, especially the roles of Bai Langning, Elizabeth, and Han Liai Tuodao, who are even more active and skilled. In short, "Grievances in the Boudoir" is a play worth watching. (It will be performed for four consecutive days starting today) Moreover, they are raising funds for the night school for civilians, and their good intentions to work hard for culture should also be commended.

### Blue Fairy Touches Pinocchio with a Magic Wand

Movie Story

### The Adventures of Pinocchio

— Ivan Extract

The Fairy Descends

Jiminy Cricket had been watching them play on the wall frame (he was too small to attract attention), and this time he couldn't help but sigh. Watching old Ge Baitu, they all entered the sweet land of sleep, and the room was as silent as the blue space - but he always had a knot in his heart and couldn't sleep. With a sound of cocoa dang dang music, Jiminy jumped up. Only to see the evening star in the sky, like a meteor, slipped into the room, this ray of light, brighter and brighter, at the splendid place appeared a beautiful blue fairy.

The Blue Fairy touched Pinocchio with a magic wand and said softly, "Wake up, little wooden man." Jiminy Cricket saw the puppet blink his eyes and stretch out his fingers and actually came to life. But the Blue Angel told the puppet: "My little man, you are alive, but you are not a real person. I can only give you life, and you have to work hard for the rest." "I want to be a real person," Pinocchio pleaded, asking. "What should I do?" "Be brave, honest, be a good child, and don't be selfish." This was the Fairy's answer.

The Blue Fairy said, and told him that the world is full of temptations and deceptions, and he should be careful to distinguish right from wrong. She sealed Jiminy Cricket as Pinocchio's "conscience," helping him decide what could or couldn't be done. "Remember, you must always listen to the advice of your 'conscience' in the future and be a brave, honest, and good child." After saying this, the Fairy turned into a ten thousand zhang golden light and gradually disappeared in the sound of cocoa dang dang music. (2)

### Cartoon News

— Zhi Hong

Since Snow White came out, the status of cartoons has become higher and higher; maybe in the future, these characters in the pen will take the place of the big stars. Starting this year, the University of Minnesota in the United States has opened a cartoon major to study the technology of cartoon production. Soon after, cartoon master Walt Disney will be able to find good helpers from this batch of college graduates. Because they have all been rigorously trained.

The school authorities have two main purposes in opening this course. The first is to enable a part of the graduates to find a job in Hollywood as they wish. The second is to prepare to draw cartoons with educational significance to test the value of cartoons in teaching. Using movies as a teaching tool is the most effective, and cartoons will be no exception. We hope that the school's experiment will provide us with strong evidence.
